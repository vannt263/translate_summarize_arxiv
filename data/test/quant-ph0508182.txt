    "in classical physics any inertial force acting on a particle is necessarily proportional to the particle s inertial mass .",
    "the principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses would then suggest that inertial forces may be of gravitational origin  an idea (  mach s principle \" ) that played a crucial role in the development of general relativity  @xcite . on the basis of the modern geometric interpretation of einstein s theory of gravitation , however , the notion that inertial effects are of gravitational origin must be rejected  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in quantum theory the inertial properties of a particle are determined by its inertial mass as well as spin .",
    "mass and spin characterize the irreducible unitary representations of the inhomogeneous lorentz group  @xcite .",
    "the inertial properties of mass are well known  @xcite ; therefore , this paper is devoted to the inertial properties of intrinsic spin .",
    "spin - rotation coupling and its consequences are described in sections  [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] . an experiment to measure this effect for neutrons",
    "is discussed in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "it follows from the treatment of dirac s equation in accelerated frames of reference that in the nonrelativistic regime the hamiltonian of a dirac particle contains @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rotation frequency of the frame and @xmath2 is the total angular momentum of the particle  @xcite . the appearance of @xmath3 is natural , since in quanum theory the total angular momentum is the generator of rotations .",
    "the term @xmath4 involving the orbital angular momentum @xmath5 is responsible for the sagnac effect , first demonstrated experimentally for slow neutrons by werner et al .",
    "we are interested in the spin - rotation coupling term @xmath6 , which does _ not _ depend upon the inertial mass of the particle ; indeed , it is an inertial effect of intrinsic spin  @xcite .",
    "it originates from the tendency of intrinsic spin to keep its aspect with respect to a global background inertial frame (  inertia of intrinsic spin \" ) . from the standpoint of observers at rest in the rotating frame ,",
    "the intrinsic spin therefore precesses in a sense that is opposite to the sense of rotation of the frame .",
    "this precessional motion can be described by the heisenberg equation of motion with the hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the coupling of spin with rotation is fully relativistic  @xcite .    to illustrate the general nature of this coupling , consider an observer rotating uniformly with frequency @xmath7 about the direction of propagation of a plane electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from the fourier analysis of the electromagnetic field measured by the rotating observer that the frequency of the wave in the rotating frame is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lorentz factor of the observer . here",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign refers to positive ( negative ) helicity radiation .",
    "multiplication by @xmath11 results in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin of the photon .",
    "this helicity contribution to the doppler effect has been verified via the gps  @xcite ; in fact , the helicity - rotation coupling is responsible for the phenomenon of _ phase wrap - up _",
    "an intuitive explanation of equation   involves the fact that in a positive ( negative ) helicity wave , the electromagnetic field rotates with frequency @xmath14 about the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "thus the rotating observer perceives positive ( negative ) helicity radiation with the electromagnetic field rotating with frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) about the direction of wave propagation .",
    "in addition , the lorentz factor in equation   is due to time dilation .",
    "more generally , the energy of a particle measured by an observer rotating with frequency @xmath7 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total ( orbital plus spin ) ",
    "magnetic \" quantum number along the axis of rotation ( @xmath19 , for a scalar or a vector particle , while @xmath20 , for a dirac particle ) . for fermions",
    ", there exists at present only indirect evidence for the existence of spin - rotation coupling  @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of the spin - rotation coupling is the energy shift that would be induced when polarized radiation passes through a rotating spin flipper . to illustrate this effect , imagine positive helicity electromagnetic radiation of frequency @xmath21 that is normally incident on a uniformly rotating half - wave plate .",
    "it follows from equation   that within the half - wave plate @xmath22 , where @xmath7 is the rotation frequency and we have assumed that @xmath23 .",
    "the spacetime in a uniformly rotating system is stationary ; therefore , @xmath24 remains constant throughout the rotating half - wave plate .",
    "the radiation that emerges has negative helicity and frequency @xmath25 , where @xmath26 by equation  .",
    "thus @xmath27 , so that the photon energy is down - shifted by @xmath28 .",
    "such an energy shift was first discovered experimentally in the microwave regime  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the general nature of spin - rotation coupling that an up / down energy shift @xmath29 occurs whenever spinning particles pass through a @xmath30-spin flipper .",
    "an experiment to measure this effect for slow neutrons was first suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this concept is elaborated in the rest of this paper .",
    "we expect that a longitudinally polarized neutron passing through a rotating @xmath30-spin flipper coil would experience an energy shift of @xmath31 that would result in a beat phenomenon in a neutron interferometer as in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "a static @xmath30-spin flipper provides a region of constant uniform magnetic field @xmath32 over a definite width @xmath33 such that the interaction @xmath34 induces a reversal of the spin direction . here",
    "@xmath35 is the neutron magnetic dipole moment , @xmath36 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the neutron speed .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ f1 ] , @xmath39 and the outgoing neutron has a spin that is antiparallel to the direction of the incident longitudinally polarized neutron .",
    "physically , we expect that a uniformly rotating spin flipper with @xmath40 would be essentially equivalent to a static coil with uniform but variable magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "we propose a neutron interferometry experiment using polarized neutrons to be carried out for two equivalent cases :    \\(1 ) rotating @xmath42- spin flipper coil :    the experimental arrangement is shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "neutrons , longitudinally polarized , pass through our interferometer with @xmath42 - spin flipper coils ( producing a uniform static magnetic field normal to the polarization axis of the neutrons ) , placed in each of the two coherent neutron beam paths .",
    "sf1 and sf2 are both optimized such that they flip the neutron spin by @xmath42 .",
    "the phase shifter allows us to set the intensity at maximum when both coils are aligned parallel . keeping the interferometer stationary in the inertial frame of the laboratory ,",
    "we then rotate sf1 with angular velocity @xmath1 parallel to the neutron wave vector and the resulting phase shift can be measured .",
    "after superposition of the two coherent beams , we expect to observe a sinusoidal intensity modulation ( beating that arises from the spin - rotation coupling ) with a beating period corresponding to @xmath7 , the rate of the rotation of sf1 . in the actual experiment , we will rotate sf1 approximately @xmath43 forth and back , since continuous full rotation would be impractical because of wires leading to the power supply and the cooling lines attached to the spin flipper coil .",
    "\\(2 ) quadrature coil :    the experimental arrangement is the same as in figure  [ f1 ] , except that the rotating @xmath42-spin flipper coil sf1 is replaced by a stationary quadrature coil , which produces a rotating magnetic field @xmath44 normal to the polarization axis of the neutrons",
    ". the expected result should be the same , since the neutron can not distinguish if sf1 is physically rotated or the magnetic field is rotated . the proposed experiment , as described in case ( 1 ) , is related to the neutron beat frequency measured by badurek et al .",
    "@xcite via the larmor theorem ; thus @xmath45 , where @xmath36 is the neutron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath46 is the magnetic field of their experiment .",
    "contemplating an experimental arrangement similar to that employed by badurek et al .",
    "@xcite , the rotation of the @xmath30-spin flipper with a period of about one minute would result in an energy difference of @xmath47 ev between the two beams of our interferometer .",
    "using neutrons of wavelength @xmath48 2  , we would expect an intensity modulation amplitude of @xmath49 counts per second  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that it may be possible to use magnetized foils  @xcite as @xmath30-flippers instead of some of the coils discussed in this section .",
    "the proposed experiment will provide a direct interferometric test of spin - rotation coupling for fermions .",
    "the phenomenon of spin - rotation coupling is of basic interest since it reveals the rotational inertia of intrinsic spin .",
