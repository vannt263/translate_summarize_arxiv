    "it is well known that , studying the spatial structures and dynamics of globular clusters ( gcs ) is of great importance for understanding both their formation condition and dynamical evolution within the environment of their galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , these clusters are ideal laboratories for detailed studies on two - body relaxation , mass segregation , stellar collisions and mergers , and core collapse @xcite . the correlations of structures with galactocentric distance can provide information on the role of the galaxy tides towards the clusters , while the distribution of ellipticity can shed light on the primary factor for cluster elongation .",
    "in addition , comparisons of structures of gcs located in different environment of galaxies offer clues to differences in the early formation and evolution of the galaxies or in their subsequent accretion histories @xcite .",
    "the `` fundamental plane '' for clusters in parameter space reflects universal cluster formation conditions , regardless of their host environments @xcite .",
    "the structural and dynamical parameters of clusters are often determined by fitting the surface brightness profiles to structure models , combined with mass - to - light ratios estimated from velocity dispersions or population - synthesis models .",
    "an accurate and well resolved density profile can be obtained by studying the distribution of integrated light coupling with star counts @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that bright young clusters in m31 are larger and more concentrated than old ones , and are expected to dissolve within a few gyr and will not survive to become old gcs . with measurements of structural parameters for 13 extended clusters ( ecs ) in the halo regions of m31 , @xcite presented that the faintest ecs have magnitudes and sizes similar to palomar - type gcs in the mw halo .",
    "@xcite measured structures and kinematics for 10 newly discovered gcs in the outer halo of m31 , and found that they have larger ellipticities than most of gcs in m31 and the mw , which may be due to galaxy tides from satellite galaxies of m31 or may be related to the merger and accretion history that m31 has experienced . using the same sample clusters in @xcite",

    "the discrepancies of these parameters from the two studies are due to the different methods , but are negligible .",

    "in these cases , we first derived the ellipse output through a boxcar filter to make a smoothed cluster profile @xcite , and then fitted these surface profiles using structural models . if some individual isophotes still can not be well fitted , these points were deleted by hand , which were masked with `` bad '' in table 3 .",
    "most profiles of the sample clusters were well fitted by the models , except for several clusters with different reasons .",
    "there are one or several bright objects at the intermediate radii of b097d , gc9 , and m091 ; the shape is very loose for dao38 ; the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low for b205 ; there are one or several bright objects near the outer region of b328 , b331 , and bh11 ; the images are not well resolved for b092 , b101 , b145 , bh05 , and nb39 ; several clusters ( b324 , b330 , b333 , b468 , gc3 , gc7 , bh04 , and bh29 ) are lack of a central brightness concentration , which may be candidates of `` ring clusters '' . the `` ring clusters '' have been reported in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and m33 @xcite , with irregular profiles such as bumps and dips which may not be attributed to the random fluctuations due to a few luminous stars .",

    "it is not unexpected to see that most of our parameters are larger than the results from @xcite , since the isophotes flagged as `` dep '' in this paper may not be excluded from the fitting process in @xcite , resulting in excessive weighting of the inner regions in the fits .",

    "<S> the results show that in the majority of cases , king models fit the m31 clusters as well as wilson models , and better than srsic models . however , there are 11 clusters best fitted by srsic models with the srsic index @xmath0 , meaning that they have cuspy central density profiles </S>",
    "<S> . these clusters may be the well - known core - collapsed candidates . </S>",
    "<S> there is a bimodality in the size distribution of m31 clusters at large radii , which is different from their galactic counterparts . in general , the properties of clusters in m31 and the milky way fall in the same regions of parameter spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the tight correlations of cluster properties indicate a `` fundamental plane '' for clusters , which reflects some universal physical conditions and processes operating at the epoch of cluster formation . </S>"
