    "ii , we describe the coherent control of harmonic oscillator modes and qubits with sfq pulses , starting from a classical model and moving to a quantum description of the coupling hamiltonian .",
    "this section includes our main numerical results for sfq gate fidelity in the presence of pulse timing imperfections and higher energy levels of the qubit .",

    "[ figs2:jitter],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +      finally , we analyze the effect of weak qubit anharmonicity on sfq gate fidelity .",
    "we treat the qubit as a three - level system with anharmonicity @xmath173 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) .",
    "the corresponding time evolution operator is a three - dimensional unitary matrix and the definition for the average fidelity has to be modified accordingly .",
    "however , since we are interested in averaging over the two - level qubit subspace of the system hilbert space , the average fidelity reduces to @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the projection operator on the qubit subspace .",
    "this expression for fidelity is consistent with eq .",
    "provided we use the following modified three - dimensional unitary operator to describe evolution under the ideal gate : @xmath176    we evaluate the error of a @xmath177 gate due to the presence of the second excited state by summing the spurious amplitude of the @xmath65 state induced by pulse @xmath127 as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the probability amplitude of the qubit being in the first excited state at time of pulse @xmath127 if it was initially in state @xmath180 with @xmath181 . here",
    "the factor @xmath182 represents the phase acquired by the second excited state over the remainder of the sequence following the @xmath127th pulse . performing summation over @xmath17 sfq pulses , we obtain the probability of excitation to the second excited state as @xmath183 here we have assumed that the @xmath26 state amplitudes + @xmath184 and @xmath185 are not significantly modified by the small amount of leakage to the second excited state , and we have disregarded direct @xmath186 transitions . the numerically evaluated curves for @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] are well described by eq .",
    "for @xmath187 . in particular",
    ", the fidelity decreases as @xmath76 for large @xmath17 , in addition to displaying an oscillating component that is more pronounced for smaller gate rotation angle @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ figs3:jitter ] we present average gate error as a function of anharmonicity @xmath188 for @xmath52 and @xmath68 gates realized using @xmath169 sfq pulses .",
    "the infidelity drastically decreases for @xmath189 and then exhibits a slower decrease with a minimum at @xmath190 .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath191 have the period @xmath192 and nearly disappear for a @xmath68 rotation . in this figure",
    ", we also plot the @xmath65 state occupation @xmath193 following the @xmath52 rotation for the qubit initially in state @xmath180 .",
    "comparison of our numerical calculations of @xmath194 with eq .",
    "shows that the two agree well for @xmath195 .     for @xmath52 ( solid line ) and @xmath68 ( dash - double - dot line ) rotations . for comparison ,",
    "the occupation probability of the @xmath65 state is shown for initial ground , @xmath196 , and excited , @xmath197 , qubit states in the case of the @xmath52 rotation .",
    "the average error always exceeds the smallest of @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the number of pulses to perform the rotation is @xmath169 .",
    "the presented curves @xmath196 and @xmath197 were obtained by numerically solving the evolution of the initial ground and excited states under the sfq pulse train , but these curves are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained from analytical expression for @xmath198 ( not shown ) .",
    "[ figs3:jitter],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +",
    "our simulations thus indicate that errors due to sfq timing jitter and weak qubit anharmonicity are roughly of the same order @xmath199 for sfq pulse trains consisting of around 100 pulses , corresponding to 20 ns for a @xmath116 rotation of a 5 ghz qubit . while these errors are nonnegligible , they are nevertheless small enough to enable robust qubit control with fast gates at error levels below the threshold for a fault - tolerant superconducting surface code @xcite .",
    "gate errors could be suppressed further by efforts to improve the timing stability of the sfq circuit or by simple circuit redesign to increase qubit anharmonicity .",
    "here we have attempted to analyze only the simplest sfq pulse trains .",
    "state - of - the - art sfq timing generators should allow the realization of robust sequences with arbitrary interpulse delays .",
    "we anticipate that optimal control tools of the sort used to optimize microwave - based single - qubit gates @xcite and fast two - qubit gates @xcite could also be employed to engineer sfq sequences with interpulse delays designed to suppress @xmath65 state errors and increase gate speed and/or fidelity over the naive gate sequences considered here .",
    "due to technical complexities of transmitting sfq pulses from chip to chip , the practical realization of sfq - based qubit gates will require the on - chip integration of the qubit circuit with at least a handful of sfq elements .",
    "while in the past the high static dissipation of sfq circuits has presented an obstacle to millikelvin - temperature operation , the recent development of low - power biasing schemes for reciprocal quantum logic ( rql ) @xcite and energy efficient sfq logic ( esfq ) @xcite opens the door to the integration of sfq and qubit circuits on the same chip .",
    "care must be taken to isolate the qubit circuit from nonequilibrium quasiparticles generated in the sfq control circuit ; however , quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit circuit can be mitigated by avoiding direct galvanic connection between the signal and ground traces of the sfq and qubit circuits .",
    "the ability to generate fluxons in close proximity to the qubit circuit will provide a high degree of robustness to the sfq - based rotations , due to the quantization of flux associated with the sfq pulses .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have described a method for the high - fidelity coherent manipulation of superconducting qubit and linear cavity modes using resonant trains of sfq pulses .",
    "the sfq pulse trains can be generated locally in the qubit cryostat without the need for an external microwave generator .",
    "taken together with a recent proposal to map the quantum information in a cqed circuit to a binary digital output using a josephson microwave photon counter @xcite , this work points a direction toward the integration of large scale superconducting quantum circuits with cold control and measurement circuitry based on sfq digital logic .",
