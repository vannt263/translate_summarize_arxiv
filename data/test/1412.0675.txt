    "one of the major long - term goals of astronomy is to place the solar system within a greater context , finding for example whether habitable planets like the earth are typical , and whether these earth analogues have conditions suitable for alien life .",
    "such goals are ambitious and many obstacles must be overcome for them to come to fruition .",
    "for the particular case of directly imaging earth - like planets around other stars , a major unknown is the level of photon noise from the dust that resides in the target system itself , specifically dust located in the `` habitable zone '' ( hz , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such dust populations are generically referred to as `` exo - zodi '' by analogy with the solar system s zodiacal cloud , though they may have different origins . to be clear , we consider the dust populations seen around 10 - 25% of nearby stars with near - infrared ( ir ) interferometry to be a largely unrelated phenomenon , based on their small grain size and hot temperatures , and lack of correlation with both mid - ir detections of hz dust ( mennesson et al . , apj , in press ) and far - ir detections of cool dust .",
    "if hz dust levels an order of magnitude or so greater than the solar system level are typical , this noise source could seriously hinder an earth analogue - imaging and characterisation mission ( which we will refer to as  earth - imaging  for brevity , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . currently , the brightness distribution ( which we also call the luminosity function ) of exo - zodi is largely unknown .",
    "limits have been set by the keck interferometer nuller ( kin , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mennesson et al . , apj , in press ) , but the distribution has only been characterised at levels 3 - 4 orders of magnitude above the solar system by photometric methods @xcite .",
    "enter the large binocular telescope interferometer ( lbti ) , a mid - ir instrument specifically designed to characterise exo - zodi at dust levels just a few times greater than the solar system s zodiacal cloud . for a brief description of the instrument see defrre et al .",
    "( submitted ) . by observing of order 50 nearby stars at this level of sensitivity ( weinberger et al . ,",
    "submitted ) , the lbti will identify specific targets with low dust levels that are suitable for future earth - imaging , and moreover will characterise the exo - zodi luminosity function with sufficient detail to provide new information on the dust origin and evolution .",
    "this latter point is important because the lbti will observe a limited number of stars and can not access the entire sky , and population - level information such as correlations with other system properties will be needed to assess the suitability of targets that are not observed with the lbti .    of course the results",
    "will also be scientifically valuable and interesting , particularly when combined with existing and future observations ( e.g. defrre et al .",
    "submitted ) .",
    "mid and far - ir imaging using telescopes such as _ spitzer , herschel _ , and jwst will provide important information on the existence , location , and structure of cooler dust belts that lie outside the hz .",
    "interferometric observations with longer baselines ( e.g. vlti / matisse ) and/or at different wavelengths ( e.g. chara / fluor , vlti / pionier ) will provide information that complements the lbti to help build a complete picture of the inner regions of individual systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to outline a modelling framework for interpreting lbti observations .",
    "such models are needed because lbti observations yield limited information on the spatial structure of any disk that is detected .",
    "it is therefore important that the model used to interpret the observations is thoroughly characterised so that the constraints placed on its various parameters can be understood in terms of their implications for the disk structure and surface brightness .",
    "the primary goal is to use the model to make a useful statement about the level of dust in a system , or the limits on undetected dust , in the habitable zone where earth - imaging will be attempted in the future .    in what follows ,",
    "we outline a parameterised dust model that can be used to approximate the solar system s zodiacal dust cloud .",
    "we show how this model can be used to derive the distribution of dust levels given an lbti observation of thermal dust emission .",
    "we then determine the corresponding implications for scattered light levels at visible wavelengths .",
    "we finally show the expected levels of dust that could be detected by the hunt for observable signatures of terrestrial planetary systems ( hosts ) survey and the corresponding scattered light levels . for a detailed description of the lbti sample",
    "we refer the reader to weinberger et al .",
    "( submitted ) , and for discussion of the instrument and the first scientific results to defrre et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "the primary goal of our exo - zodiacal cloud model is to allow easy comparison of the results among survey stars , which span a range of distances and luminosities . in general",
    "we expect that detections will be near the sensitivity limits , and that there will be little information about any warm dust detected ( or not detected ) other than from lbti .",
    "therefore , while warm dust may arise from various different processes , for example _ in situ _ asteroid - belt like evolution , stochastic collisions , delivery of comets from elsewhere , or some combination of all three ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will have little power to distinguish among them .",
    "some scenarios could result in clumpy non - axisymmetric structures , but there again is little hope of distinguishing these from axisymmetric structures in all but the dustiest systems where lbti detections will be relatively easy and at high signal to noise ratios .",
    "therefore , the models considered here are axisymmetric .      for specific stars , the stellar luminosity @xmath1 ( in solar units ) is easily derived by fitting stellar atmosphere models to photometry , and the flux density @xmath2 at any wavelength can be inferred from these models . given a distance @xmath3 , the stellar radius can be estimated from the same model , though in some cases it may have been directly observed . in any case , the contribution of the resolved stellar disk to an lbti observation will generally be negligible .",
    "here we use the stellar fluxes for hosts survey stars derived by weinberger et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "lbti observations are sensitive to the surface brightness distribution @xmath4 in the n band at 11@xmath5 m ( the bandpass spans 9.81 - 12.41 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "our model can be considered a means of parameterising this surface brightness distribution using parameters that have some physical relevance . unless stated otherwise , in what follows our calculations are made at 11 @xmath5 m .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the disk , if viewed face - on , is modelled as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the temperature of disk material that behaves like a black body @xmath8 where the distance to the star , @xmath9 , is in au .",
    "the numerical factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : sb ] is a conversion ( 1au@xmath10/1pc@xmath10 ) so that the surface brightness is in units of jy arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is representative of the disk s face - on surface density of cross - sectional area ( in au@xmath10/au@xmath10 ) , so is analogous to optical depth and is assumed to have a power law distribution @xmath13 between radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( both in au ) .",
    "the normalisation @xmath16 is to be set at some @xmath17 ( in au ) such that the surface density is in units of zodis @xmath18 ( see section [ ss : zodi ] ) .    for generality",
    "we include an inclination @xmath19 , which is half the total opening angle of the disk , and represents the maximum inclination of the parent bodies ( whose nodes would be assumed to be randomised ) . here",
    "we assume that our disks have negligible opening angles so @xmath19 is not used , but that @xmath19 is always sufficiently large that the disk is radially optically thin .",
    "if all of the disk particles behave like black bodies , the parameter @xmath12 can be interpreted as the disk s surface density of cross - sectional area .",
    "its interpretation becomes more complicated for disks with more realistic particle optical properties because the observed dust can be several times hotter than the black body temperature , and not all radiation incident on a particle is absorbed and thermally re - emitted .",
    "however , as the surface brightness is typically assumed to exhibit a power law dependence across the relevant radius range , we have not lost any generality by expressing the disk surface brightness in this way , even if the disk s temperature profile differs from that of a black body .",
    "these issues will be discussed in more detail in sections [ ss : other ] and [ ss : scat ] .",
    "the final parameters , which specify the direction to the observer relative to the disk , are the disk inclination @xmath20 and the position angle @xmath21 .",
    "the inclination is defined such that @xmath22 is face - on and the position angle is measured anticlockwise ( i.e. east ) from north . the range of inclinations is 0 to @xmath23 and the range of position angles 0 to @xmath24 , ) means that if the disks are not spatially resolved we in fact only need to consider angles between 0 and 90@xmath25 .",
    "we retain the larger range because we may wish to set @xmath21 based on the position angle of the star or an outer disk component . ] with these ranges set because we can not distinguish between the near and far side of a disk .",
    "that is , the faint disks considered here are optically thin viewed from any direction , and in thermal emission look the same mirrored in the sky plane or for 180@xmath25 rotations .",
    "the model parameters and their meanings are summarised in table [ tab : params ] .",
    ".model parameters [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      ` zodipic `  is an implementation of the @xcite zodiacal cloud model .",
    "this parametric model has many parameters , whose values were derived via fitting to cobe / dirbe observations . `",
    "zodipic `  produces two - dimensional images of the solar system s zodiacal dust cloud as might be seen by an external observer , and has been used as a reference model for calculating the limits set by kin observations @xcite .",
    "though it is a complex model and can include dust components such as the earth s resonant ring and trailing blob , only the main smooth axisymmetric component is normally used . because this main component is simply a radial power law , with an approximately gaussian vertical density distribution , it is possible to reproduce the ` zodipic `  surface brightness using our parameterised model .",
    "the vertical dust distribution is the main difference between the @xcite model and ours .",
    "the @xcite model assumes that the radial and vertical components of the cloud are separable @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the height above the disk midplane in au .",
    "the best fit values for the cobe data were @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the units of the normalisation are au@xmath10/au@xmath35 ( i.e. a volume density of surface area ) , and the integrated length of the vertical term is not constant with radius , so their exponent @xmath36 is not the same as our exponent @xmath37 . numerically integrating equation ( [ eq : zodipic2 ] ) over @xmath38 yields 0.63 , so the surface density at 1 au is @xmath39 ( au@xmath10/au@xmath10 ) .",
    "assuming for mathematical simplicity that @xmath40 , the integral of the exponential term in equation ( [ eq : zodipic ] ) is @xmath41 for both cases of @xmath42 , and hence @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the ` zodipic `  model can be reasonably expressed in terms of our model with @xmath45 au @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "there remain a few small differences in the surface brightness of our model relative to ` zodipic ` , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] .",
    "the main difference is that the ` zodipic `  model is slightly brighter at larger radii because the radial temperature profile is flatter .",
    "setting the ` zodipic `  temperature profile to equal our black body prescription leads to nearly indistinguishable face - on surface brightness profiles .",
    "some minor differences arise because the @xcite model defines radius as @xmath48 , whereas our narrow opening angle means that our model is effectively cylindrical .              here",
    "we introduce a reference disk model , the parameters of which are summarised in table [ tab : params ] and based on the @xcite solar system model described above .",
    "the model extends from 0.034 - 10 au with a power - law index @xmath49 , and is scaled to @xmath50 at @xmath45 au ( the location where @xmath51 k ) .",
    "the inner edge is set by a black body temperature of 1500k , approximately the sublimation temperature of silicates , though we show in section [ ss : other ] that this choice is irrelevant for our model as long as the inner disk edge is inside the iwa of 40 mas .",
    "the outer edge of 10 au is chosen to be sufficiently large that it does not affect the model at the lbti wavelength of 11 @xmath5 m .",
    "as noted above we treat the disk as two dimensional so the opening angle is small .",
    "our reference model is based on the solar system so the star is sun - like , but as described in section [ ss : zodi ] the reference parameters are later varied to model disks around different stars .",
    "figure [ fig : mod ] shows the distribution of temperature , surface density and surface brightness at 11@xmath5 m in this reference model , where we have assumed a distance of 10 pc .",
    "survey targets are chosen so that the lbti is sensitive to dust in their habitable zone ( weinberger et al . , submitted ) , so the dotted lines show the range of radii implied by a temperature range of 210 - 320k , a rough indication of the habitable zone location for the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the right panel shows that the surface brightness of our model closely matches ` zodipic ` , and as noted above this difference only arises due to different assumptions about the radial temperature profile .",
    "therefore , for the same assumptions and aside from the differences in scale height our model yields the same results as ` zodipic `  for a sun - like star .",
    "the disk normalisation ( i.e. brightness ) is set by the parameter @xmath16 , which is the disk surface density at @xmath17 .",
    "the goal here is to set what @xmath52 and @xmath17 are so that they scale sensibly with stellar spectral type , and so that our disk model is somehow sensibly related to zodi units , and therefore the solar system dust level .",
    "these parameters , along with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath37 , and @xmath19 define our reference disk model . in making this definition ,",
    "it is important to remember the ultimate goal of the lbti , which is to constrain the level of dust in the habitable zone around nearby stars .",
    "that is , disk surface brightness is the most important measure of the impact of exo - zodi on future earth - imaging missions .",
    "a desirable definition might be one of `` constant hindrance '' for an earth - imaging mission , where @xmath16 is set such that a @xmath53 disk impacts all observations in search of exo - earths at the same level .",
    "however , for this imaging any exo - earths will be unresolved , whereas the exo - zodi that accompany them will be resolved , so the same physical disk has the same surface brightness regardless of distance , but the brightness of the unresolved planet decreases with distance .",
    "therefore , any zodi definition that attempts to provide constant hindrance will be distance dependent , which is an undesirable property since it is unrelated to the physical disk structure .    to set @xmath16 therefore requires a choice between using either the total disk brightness , or the surface brightness at @xmath17 .",
    "both approaches have their merits .",
    "for example , using the total disk brightness allows comparison with photometric observations and therefore easy construction of the warm dust luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , as we show below in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnutvsr ] , lbti observations are not necessarily sensitive to total disk brightness ( e.g. when a significant fraction of the disk emission lies inside the first transmission peak ) .",
    "we therefore prefer a zodi definition linked to the disk surface density in the habitable zone . for the spectral type scaling",
    ", it then makes sense for @xmath17 to scale with @xmath54 , so that the surface brightness expressed by @xmath16 corresponds to the radial distance where the equilibrium temperature is the same as at earth ( i.e. an `` earth - equivalent '' distance ) , therefore @xmath55 au .",
    "scaling @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath56 is also appropriate , since this results in a common temperature at the inner and outer edges of the disk , and maintains the disk inner edge at the sublimation radius .",
    "the disk edges are of relatively little importance here because as we show below the lbti is relatively insensitive to their location .    with this definition ,",
    "@xmath16 is fixed at the surface density of the solar system s zodiacal cloud at 1 au , but the location where this surface density applies depends on the stellar luminosity .",
    "this definition is different to ` zodipic ` , which fixes @xmath17 at 1 au for all stars and fixes @xmath14 at the sublimation radius .",
    "because the dust temperature at @xmath17 is the same for all spectral types , the thermal surface brightness at @xmath17 ( i.e. in the habitable zone ) for a 1 zodi disk is also the same . because it is based on surface brightness , this zodi definition is well suited for use as an important metric for future earth - imaging missions .",
    "an lbti observation is not necessarily sensitive to the radial extent of a disk , so the derived zodi level depends on what is assumed for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , particularly if the disk is relatively narrow .",
    "for example , below we consider a `` worst case '' scenario where the dust emission only originates in the habitable zone , in which case the derived dust surface density ( and hence @xmath18 ) is higher for a given null depth . to avoid confusion",
    "we recommend that zodi levels primarily use our reference model to allow consistent comparisons .",
    "the original concept for nulling interferometry was put forward by @xcite , and for a reasonably non - technical description of the instrument we refer the reader to defrre et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "basically speaking , the lbti combines the beams from the two lbt mirrors , with one beam having a half - wavelength phase shift .",
    "light in the viewing direction , and along lines perpendicular to the mirror baseline vector , is therefore suppressed .",
    "light from off axis sources at odd multiples of the angular distance @xmath57 is transmitted ( @xmath58 is the baseline length ) .",
    "similarly , light from sources at even multiples of this angular distance is suppressed .",
    "the transmission ( or `` fringe '' ) pattern is therefore a @xmath59 function parallel to the baseline vector , and is constant perpendicular to this vector . a model disk , the transmission pattern , and the transmitted disk image",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trx ] .",
    "this illustration is for an object at transit ; at other times the fringe pattern is not aligned with north .",
    "the key measurement from an lbti observation is the ratio of the transmitted flux to the total photometric flux .",
    "because the transmission pattern is designed to suppress light from the star , leaving light from a much fainter disk , this ratio is approximately the ratio of the transmitted disk flux to the stellar flux .",
    "deriving the transmitted disk flux is not straightforward however , as some on - axis ( i.e. stellar ) flux is always transmitted because the instrument is not perfect and the star has a finite angular size .",
    "removal of these effects is an integral part of the data analysis ( see defrre et al , submitted ) , so the quantity derived from a given observation is the `` calibrated null depth '' or `` source null depth '' . in what follows",
    "we generally refer to this measurement and the same quantity derived from our models as simply the `` null depth '' .",
    "because the total flux is almost exactly the stellar flux and dominates over any disk emission , we therefore compute the null depth for our models as the transmission for a starless model divided by the stellar flux density .",
    "our disk model is radially extended , but to illustrate how surface brightness is transmitted through the lbti transmission pattern as a function of angular scale we first consider a series of discrete annuli of angular radii @xmath60 .",
    "we later combine these annuli to model the transmission for our disk models .",
    "the angular distance to the first transmission peak is @xmath61 ; for the lbti @xmath62 @xmath5 m and @xmath63 m , so the distance is 79 mas .",
    "the transmission function perpendicular to the fringes @xmath64 is @xmath65)$ ] , and is shown as the grey line in figure [ fig : trvsr ] , where the x axis is the distance from the annulus center in units of the distance to the first transmission peak ( i.e. @xmath66 ) . a common definition for the inner working angle of an instrument is where the sensitivity first reaches half of the peak value , which for lbti is therefore at @xmath67 mas .    ) .",
    "the grey line is the projected transmission function parallel to the lbti baseline , the blue dashed line is the fraction of emission for face - on ( @xmath22 ) annuli after summing around the azimuthal angle .",
    "dots show a population of annuli with random inclinations and position angles , and the red line shows the average transmission of these dots.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to calculate the transmission for a point at some azimuth around the annulus requires finding the sky - plane component of this vector point ( relative to the star ) that is perpendicular to the fringe pattern .",
    "this component can be calculated using three rotations , and is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the angle from the sky plane around the annulus to the point of interest , and @xmath70 is the position angle of the annulus relative to the lbti fringe pattern .",
    "the angle @xmath70 varies with hour angle , and because the lbti baseline is always perpendicular to the local vertical ( i.e. a great circle through the target and zenith ) , is equal to @xmath21 for an object at transit .",
    "the transmission from a point in the annulus is then \\right)/2\\ ] ] where @xmath71 are the sky offsets from the null center and @xmath72 the corresponding spatial frequencies ( i.e. @xmath73 ) .",

    "@xmath74 ) \\ , .\\ ] ] for a face - on ( @xmath22 ) annulus at radius @xmath75 , the transmission is clearly a function of azimuth around the annulus .",
    "averaging around an annulus yields the total transmission for that annulus , and repeating this calculation for annuli of different angular sizes gives the blue dashed line in figure [ fig : trvsr ] .",
    "this exercise is finally repeated for a large number of annuli with random orientations , so that @xmath76 is distributed evenly from 0 to 1 , and @xmath70 is evenly distributed from 0 to 180@xmath25 .",
    "again , the transmission around each annulus is azimuthally averaged , which results in the dots shown in figure [ fig : trvsr ] . averaging these points",
    "yields the average transmission as a function of annulus radius for a population of disks with random orientations , shown as the red line .",
    "as can be surmised from the decreasing amplitude , the average transmission tends to 0.5 at large separations ( i.e. the average of @xmath59 is 0.5 ) .",
    "the minimum separation at which this transmission is achieved is @xmath77 , twice the inner working angle .",
    "the origin of the dot distribution can be understood by considering how annuli of different orientations are transmitted through a given transmission peak .",
    "for example , the upper envelope of dots at about 70% transmission are all transmitted through the first transmission peak , and those at higher @xmath66 are nearer to edge - on with position angles closer to @xmath78 ( i.e. perpendicular to the baseline and parallel to the fringes ) .",
    "this effect is relatively common because the average inclination is about 60@xmath25 ( i.e. biased towards edge - on ) . by comparing the phase of the grey line with the red line , it is clear that the peak average transmission is actually about a quarter of the way beyond a transmission peak , and that the peak transmission for face - on annuli lies somewhere in between .",
    "the phase shift of the face - on transmission can be understood by realising that an annulus with a radius @xmath75 that is slightly greater than @xmath77 has more emission in the peak transmission region than an annulus with @xmath79 .",
    "the average transmission for random orientations is phase shifted slightly further because most disks are inclined , and therefore on average appear somewhat smaller on the sky than they actually are .      .",
    "flux is lost at all radii due to the transmission pattern , but most is lost from inside the habitable zone .",
    "the total and transmitted disk fluxes are 0.11 and 0.031 mjy.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the reference model of section [ sss : ref ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : fnutvsr ] shows the total and transmitted disk flux as a function of radius for a face - on geometry and a distance of 10 pc .",
    "that is , the figure is a histogram showing where the total and transmitted flux originates , so the solid line is an azimuthally summed radial profile created from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trx ] .",
    "much of the total disk emission originates from the inner regions , and since the disk inner edge is well inside the first transmission peak significant flux from these inner regions is not transmitted .",
    "some flux is also lost at larger radii , and in total only about 30% of the disk flux is transmitted .",
    "overall therefore , the radial distance over which the disk emits strongly in the mid - ir and can be detected is not particularly large ; emission is strongly reduced inside the inner working angle , and the faint wien side of cooler emission means that the surface brightness drops steeply at larger radii .",

    "the dotted line shows the average transmitted flux derived in figure [ fig : fnutvsr ] .",

    "the mean level is 0.026 mjy , and the medial level 0.029 mjy.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : ftrhist ] shows how the total transmitted flux is distributed for a random distribution of disk orientations .",
    "the concentration of transmitted fluxes near the maximum arises because any disk with a position angle perpendicular to the transmission pattern has the same transmitted flux , regardless of inclination ( and any disk near to face - on also has the same transmitted flux ) .",
    "the low transmitted flux tail arises from disks that have a position angle parallel to the transmission pattern and are sufficiently near to edge on such that almost the entire disk lies in the central null transmission region .",
    "such a geometry is relatively unlikely , as can be seen by the lack of dots with low transmission in fig .",
    "[ fig : trvsr ] .",
    "these relatively rare low transmitted fluxes are allowed because we assume disks with negligible scale height .",
    "this distribution therefore represents a pessimistic ( but possible ) case , and becomes tighter as the disk scale height increases .",
    "the width of the distribution also depends on the range of hour angles over which a target is observed , as discussed in section [ ss : ha ] .",
    "the point here is that the transmitted flux depends on the orientation , and since this is expected to be unconstrained for lbti targets ( unless we use stellar inclination or the orientation of a resolved outer disk as an estimate , which will be possible for some of the hosts sample ) , there will be a corresponding uncertainty in any disk parameters that are derived from the observations .",
    "since the transmitted flux scales linearly with @xmath16 , the distribution of @xmath16 , and hence @xmath18 , required to reproduce a given transmitted flux is directly related to that in figure [ fig : ftrhist ] .",
    "the distribution of possible null depths for our reference model at 10 pc is therefore calculated by dividing the distribution of transmitted fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftrhist ] by the stellar flux .",
    "the distribution of zodi levels @xmath18 implied for a given observed null depth ( or upper limit ) is found by dividing the observed null depth by the distribution of model null depths for @xmath53 .",
    "this was the method employed by @xcite in modelling kin observations with ` zodipic ` .",
    "any real lbti observation takes a finite amount of time , during which any disk will rotate relative to the transmission pattern on the sky .",
    "thus , even a vertically thin edge - on disk , which can be instantaneously invisible to the lbti , will be visible when the length of the observation is taken into account .    to compute how the disk transmission changes for an observation of a given object requires computing the position angle of the lbti fringe pattern on the sky at a given hour angle .",
    "the common mirror mount for the lbt means that this angle is the difference between the vector in the direction of the local vertical and a vector pointing towards equatorial north along a line of constant right ascension through the object in question ( i.e. the hour circle ) .",
    "this angle is commonly called the parallactic angle .",

    "these are spaced evenly in hour angle , but future models will use the true distribution for each specific observation .",

    "the lbti is well suited to observing dust levels in the habitable regions around nearby stars , both in terms of baseline length and observing wavelength .",
    "lbti results will therefore broadly address the goal of characterising warm dust levels without requiring additional information from other observations .",

    "[ fig : spec ] shows disk spectra for our reference model with @xmath53 , with examples for both sun - like and a - type host stars at 10 pc .",
    "because our standard model has the same temperature range all disk spectra have the same shape , but are brighter or fainter depending on the zodi level , the distance to the host star , and the host star spectral type ( which changes the area of the disk and hence total brightness ) .",
    "the a5v star has @xmath84 , so the disk around this star is 14 times brighter than for the sun - like star . however , the a - star is only about 5 times brighter at 11 @xmath5 m ( 10 vs. 2 jy ) , so the disk / star flux ratio has increased by a factor of about 3 .",
    "[ fig : spec ] also shows how the spectrum varies when @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath37 are changed from their standard values , and what the effect is at the lbti wavelength of 11 @xmath5 m .",
    "larger values of @xmath37 concentrate the disk emission closer to the star and hence shift the spectrum towards warmer temperatures . changing @xmath85 and @xmath15 remove emission from the inner and outer disk regions , leading to a spectrum that is closer to a single - temperature black body spectrum .",
    "as noted above and shown by the curve for @xmath86 au , the outer disk radius is large enough that the exact value matters little for the level of emission at 11 @xmath5 m .",
    "while our model gives a reasonable idea of the true disk spectrum , and could in principle be used to constrain disk structure based on observations at other wavelengths , it is inaccurate on a detailed level because grains do not emit like black bodies .",
    "three important differences are that i ) the disk will be fainter than our model at long wavelengths because grains emit inefficiently at wavelengths longer than their size , ii ) the spectrum may also be shifted to shorter wavelengths due to the presence of small grains with temperatures greater than that of a black body , and iii ) the spectrum may show non - continuum spectral features .",
    "these differences pose problems for extrapolating our model to other wavelengths , or at least mean that additional parameters such as grain properties would need to be considered .",
    "+    such differences are of minor importance here however , as important comparisons with other observations can be made at the lbti wavelength , so are largely independent of the disk spectrum .",
    "the most important comparison is between the total and transmitted disk fluxes , or equally the total disk to star flux ratio and the null depth . to illustrate why combining such measurements is important , fig .",
    "[ fig : rin ] shows how the total and transmitted model disk flux changes at 11 @xmath5 m as the disk inner and outer radii change . as @xmath14",
    "is increased the total disk flux decreases because hot emission is being removed . however , the lbti - transmitted flux changes little while @xmath14 remains small , because these changes occur behind the central transmission minimum and are invisible .",
    "when @xmath14 is outside the first transmission peak ( at about 0.7 au here ) both the total and transmitted fluxes decrease in the same way . as @xmath15",
    "is decreased there is initially little difference in the total and transmitted fluxes because the outer disk is faint at 11 @xmath5 m , but when @xmath15 moves behind the central transmission minimum the flux drops much more steeply than the total flux . as noted earlier , fig .",
    "[ fig : rin ] shows that the lbti transmission is insensitive to our choice of disk inner and outer radii , as long as the disk is much wider than the habitable zone .",
    "given such relations between the total and transmitted disk fluxes , it is clear that observations of both may constrain the disk location .",
    "however , the transmitted disk flux is a function of both the disk size and the orientation , so the best constraints on the disk size require the orientation to be known ( or take some assumed value ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the position angle will be inferred from lbti measurements in many cases , so the disk orientation would probably be assumed based on other system information , such as coplanarity with a resolved outer cool disk component , the known inclination and/or position angle of the host star s rotation axis , or of planet orbits , or a combination of all three @xcite .",

    "therefore , the thermal dust emission information from the lbti must be converted to predict the impact on scattered light imaging .",
    "we now derive a simple prescription for converting the dust levels in the above model into scattered light surface brightness estimates .",
    "scattered light predictions are in general difficult , and have largely proven unsuccessful to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the steepness of the size distribution means that these grains dominate the surface area .",
    "such grains are expected to scatter optical light fairly isotropically , and have fairly large albedoes of @xmath880.5 .",
    "the scattered light faintness of debris disks , where albedoes of 0.05 - 0.1 are seen ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , likely arise from incorrect assumptions about grain properties and sizes , and how these grains scatter starlight .",
    "the properties of exo - zodi are not sufficiently well known that considering physically motivated possibilities for different grain sizes and properties would make predictions for their scattered light brightness more certain .",
    "therefore , regardless of the physical reason , we will assume that the @xmath890.1 effective albedoes seen for scattered light disks around nearby stars are representative , and assume isotropic scattering .",
    "it may be that the properties of warm dust are different to those inferred from scattered light detections , since for example hot dust detected with near - ir interferometry is generally inferred to originate in much smaller grains . for higher / lower albedoes , our scattered light predictions would be higher / lower by the same factor .    while the model surface density @xmath12 is connected to the true optical depth and the surface area of grains from which the emission arises",

    "a convenient form is @xmath96 which we could also express in terms of albedo @xmath97 by substituting @xmath98 . if we assume the albedo @xmath99 is the empirical value of 0.1 , independent of grain size and wavelength , then because @xmath100 the surface density @xmath101 is approximately the true optical depth , but is underestimated by a factor of @xmath102 ( i.e. @xmath103 $ ] ) .",
    "that is , with these assumptions the thermal surface brightness could be written @xmath104    the scattered light brightness is therefore calculated using the dust surface density and the empirical effective albedo . with these assumptions ,",

    "this is the approach we use below to estimate the limiting scattered light surface brightnesses for hosts , and for the lbti @xmath87 crv detection .",
    "an extension to this approach would be to add a phase function that accounts for forward scattering properly .",
    "the albedo could then be derived theoretically and calibrated with observations .",
    "while in the above case the scattered light can be calculated simply along the radial direction , and for a given orientation turned into an image , use of a phase function @xmath109 requires a three - dimensional calculation that includes the star - particle - observer scattering angle @xmath69 at each location in the disk .",
    "given that we expect relatively large uncertainties in disk parameters , even in the case of a detection , use of a detailed three - dimensional calculation including ( assumed ) grain properties and a phase function will in general be unwarranted .",
    "to convert the simple scattered light prediction of equation ( [ eq : ssca ] ) to an observable for an arbitrary disk inclination a three dimensional calculation must be made to account for brighter disk ansae .",
    "however , the disk inclination will in general be unknown , so a simple approximation for deriving a representative scattered light surface brightness would be to assume an average inclination of @xmath110 , and for a vertically thin disk an increase of @xmath111 .",

    "the distribution is strongly peaked at about @xmath114 , with a tail of larger values due to unfavourable disk orientations . the 1@xmath115 zodi uncertainty due purely to the calibrated null depth measurement is given by the width of the `` median @xmath116 null uncertainty '' error bar in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : etacrvlim ] .",
    "similarly , the 16 and 84% levels from the cumulative distribution give a representative 1@xmath115 range due to the orientation distribution . the upper uncertainty on the zodi level is therefore set by the orientation distribution , while the lower uncertainty is set by the null depth measurement . the median zodi level for @xmath87 crv",

    "as expected for a narrower disk that emits over a smaller total physical area , the disk to star flux ratios are lower than for our reference model , as are the null depths .",
    "while the difference between the two models is about a factor of five in disk / star flux ratio , the difference in null depths is only a factor of two to three because most of the flux removed from the disk in the narrower model is hidden behind the central transmission minimum ( e.g. fig .",

    "similarly , the difference in zodi levels is a factor two to three higher in this case compared to our reference model .",
    "therefore , the effect of this pessimistic scenario in terms of habitable zone dust levels is relatively minor .",

    "<S> habitable zone dust levels are a key unknown that must be understood to ensure the success of future space missions to image earth analogues around nearby stars . </S>",
    "<S> current detection limits are several orders of magnitude above the level of the solar system s zodiacal cloud , so characterisation of the brightness distribution of exo - zodi down to much fainter levels is needed . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the large binocular telescope interferometer ( lbti ) will detect thermal emission from habitable zone exo - zodi a few times brighter than solar system levels . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a modelling framework for interpreting lbti observations , which yields dust levels from detections and upper limits that are then converted into predictions and upper limits for the scattered light surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this model to the hosts survey sample of nearby stars ; assuming a null depth uncertainty of 10@xmath0 the lbti will be sensitive to dust a few times above the solar system level around sun - like stars , and to even lower dust levels for more massive stars . </S>"
