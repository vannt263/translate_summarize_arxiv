    "most of the cms detector components are assembled on the ground , and about 15 large detector units will be lowered in the cavern for final assembly works .",

    "this is maximum possible rectangular parallelepiped volume that can be placed in the cavern , with the given space to the cavern wall and with its long edge being the same as that of the cms barrel part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stopper ] ) .",

    "we also assume that stopping power of the cms detector is equivalent to @xmath34 g/@xmath35 iron , where @xmath36 is angle between the cnlsp direction and the beam direction .",
    "the number comes from the average density of cms detector , 3.37g/@xmath33 , which leads to the weight per @xmath35 for the radial direction of @xmath37 .    as discussed in the previous paper  @xcite",

    "the size of the detector is probably enough to stop a certain amount of cnlsps and measure the decay rate , and therefore it may well be appropriate for the a first stage of the cnlsp study .",
    "on the other hand , it is certainly not enough for a detailed energy measurement of the @xmath0 decay product .",
    "most of the hadronic decay cascades are not fully contained for a detector with the geometry allowed by the space in the cms cavern . a high density detector consisting of the layers of drift tubes / scintillators or rpcs to measure the charged particles between iron plates thicker than soudan ii will be more optimized for the cnlsp study .",
    "in this paper we assume a conservative energy resolution for hadronic showers , which is around @xmath52 .",

    "an additional complexity may occur for showers which develop parallel to the layers of the tracking devices .",
    "if the particles pass mostly through tracking devices , they feel a much lower average density , while the particles going mostly through the iron plates do not give detectable signature efficiently .",
