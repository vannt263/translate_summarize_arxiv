    "historically , energy spectra have been the primary focus of both observers and theorists .",
    "the low state spectrum of cyg x-1 ( see fig . 1 ) for the most part is well - fit by a power - law with a photon index @xmath0 .",
    "additional facts to keep in mind are : the total luminosity of cyg x-1 is likely @xmath1 , and that most other black holes show a strong soft component and softer power - law tail above @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "nowak 1995 ) . the softer , high state of cyg x-1 is of roughly comparable luminosity to the low state ( zhang 1996 ) .",
    "the soft components that do exist in the low state are weak compared to the power - law .",
    "the most popular models for this state are hot , optically thin models [ with advection dominated disks ( add ) being one example , cf .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "1996 ] , and comptonization of seed photons from a cold disk ( cf .",
    "haardt & maraschi 1993 ; dove , wilms , & begelman 1996 ) . add theories provide",
    "an explanation for the hard to soft transition at @xmath3 , although they have yet to self - consistently calculate the ( weak ) observed features that comptonization models attribute to reflection .",
    "one theoretical motivation for the comptonization models is the recent work ( cf .",
    "balbus , et al .",
    "1996 ; hawley et al .",
    "1996 ) demonstrating the existence of a powerful magnetic field - driven shear instability that is strongest in low - density regions .",
    "comptonization models assume that most of the disk energy is dissipated in a corona , with roughly half being reprocessed by the disk into soft photons ( cf . haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "fitting the spectra of cyg x-1 above 2 kev typcally requires @xmath4 and @xmath5 kev . with roughly half of the luminosity being reprocessed by the disk , and a large fraction escaping the optically thin corona",
    ", we expect a large soft flux at @xmath6 ev .",
    "this is _ not _ observed ( see fig . 1 and dove , wilms , begelman 1996 , where more refined models will be presented ) .",
    "in addition to not offering an explanation for the low  high transition at @xmath7 , this is a severe problem for the corona models .",
    "the models do , however , correctly account for the fe - line and reflection features , with @xmath8 half of the soft 200 ev excess being due to reflection ( as opposed to intrinsic disk emission ) .",
    "add models , with a similar geometry and a strong source of hard photons , may also overproduce soft x - rays if they attempt to model the observed fe - line with reflection off of the optically thick , geometrically thin outer disk .",
    "cyg x-1 shows strong x - ray variability ( rms fluctuations @xmath9 ) , with timescales ranging from milliseconds to tens of seconds .",
    "this variability is usually measured by fourier transforming the observed time series and then forming the power spectral density ( psd ) , i.e. the squared transform .",
    "one can also form the cross power density ( cpd ) by multiplying together the complex transforms from two time series .",
    "the fourier frequency - dependent phase of the cpd is known as the phase delay , @xmath10 , from which one can form the time delay , @xmath11 .",
    "cygnus x-1 shows a characteristic time lag of the hard photons behind the soft , with @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "miyamoto et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a nearly constant phase delay of @xmath13 rad .",
    "the only currently proposed add model explanation for this delay invokes thermal disturbances propagating from the outer disk edge toward the center ( cf .",
    "manmoto et al .",
    "this model requires , however , a very slow propagation speed @xmath14 in order to be in quantitative aggreement with observations ( cf . vaughan & nowak 1996 ) .",
    "corona models explain the delay as possibly arrising from the magnetic flares that are allegedly energizing the corona ( cf .",
    "nowak 1994 ) .",
    "if the flare temperature increases throughout its evolution , hard photons naturally lag soft photons .",
    "however , diffusion of photon scattering times within the corona will lead to a  smearing out \" of this intrinsic time lag , depending upon the spectrum of the seed photons , the corona temperature , optical depth , and mean free scattering path ( cf . fig.2 ; miller 1995 ; nowak & vaughan 1996 ) .",
    "current observations rule out large scattering paths ( @xmath15 cm ) with very soft ( @xmath16 ev ) inputs . upcoming rxte observations ( obtaining phase lags in 6 - 8 energy channels out to @xmath17 hz ) will provide more stringent constraints .",
    "the coherence function is essentially the normalized _ average _ amplitude of the cpd ( cf .",
    "vaughan & nowak 1996 , nowak & vaughan 1996 ) .",
    "it is a measure of the fraction of the two time series that can be interpreted as _ time - independent and linear _ transforms of one another .",
    "coherence must be less than or equal to unity , and be equal to unity only when there is a linear , time - indpendent transfer function relating one channel to the other .",
    "coherence is less than unity under any of the following conditions : variability is due to thermal flares that are dominated by emission from the wien tale ; there are multiple , independent sources of variability ( whether linear or not ) with multiple , independent responses to the sources ( whether linear of not ) ; there is _ any _ non - linear transfer function from one channel to the other ( cf . vaughan & nowak 1996 ) .",
    "if coronae are truly formed via multiple magnetic flares , then we expect a strong loss of coherence , unless the the response to _ each _ of the flares is identical .",
    "nowak ( 1994 ) showed that a kinematic model , with multiple flaring regions , reproduced both the psd and phase lags seen in the very high state of gx3394 , as well as qualititatively agreed with the energetics of coronal formation .",
    "this model , and all others like it , produces a strong loss of coherence ( fig .",
    "this is _ not _ seen in cyg x-1 ( fig .",
    "3 ; vaughan & nowak 1996 ) , which shows near unity coherence between _ all _ well - observed energies .",
    "this also disagrees with the model of manmoto et al .",
    "for that case the disturbance shocks upon reflection off of the disk inner edge , which is an inherently non - linear process , and thus leads to less than unity coherence for a stochastic source of variability .",
    "as they currently stand , coronal models of cyg x-1 have several problems .",
    "they predict too much soft x - ray flux , and they have yet to offer a viable explanation for the phase lags that also preserves unity coherence .",
    "add models also do not offer an explanation for the observed coherence , and they have yet to self - consistently calculate the observed  reflection \" and line features .",
