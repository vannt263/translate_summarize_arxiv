    "the simplest realization of a cavity quantum electrodynamic system consists of a single material fermion coupled to a boson field .",
    "our work in the optical regime couples rb atoms and a finite number of modes of an optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "these systems have numerous applications in quantum information science  @xcite , and also enable the study of quantum optics effects difficult to observe in free space  @xcite .",
    "our current cavity qed experimental setup incorporates two independent vacuum chamber components : a spherical hexagon and a cube ( see fig .  [ chamber ] ) .",
    "the former houses an unbalanced magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , from which we obtain a low - velocity intense source ( lvis ) of @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite .",
    "the mot uses a pair of coils to generate a quadrupole magnetic field , with two retro - reflected laser beams in the horizontal plane , and a third along the axis of the strong magnetic field gradient ( vertical direction ) . at the bottom of the chamber",
    ", the vertical beam strikes a gold mirror and quarter - wave plate that have a 1.5-mm diameter hole , yielding a region of unbalanced laser intensity that pushes out a beam of cold atoms . directly below",
    "the hexagon lies a cubic chamber which contains the optical cavity .",
    "atoms propagate 3 - 4 cm through the mirror to the cavity and are optically pumped to a desired @xmath2 state _ en route_. a fraction of the atoms pass between the cavity mirrors ( 2.2 mm spacing ) and couple to the tem@xmath3 mode ( @xmath4 field radius 56 @xmath5 m ) for @xmath1 5 @xmath5s before striking the bottom of the vacuum chamber .",
    "( color online ) current vacuum chamber ( not drawn to scale ) .",
    "unbalanced mot ( red beams ) by hole in mirror creates lvis.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the current arrangement has room for improvement in several fronts : light from the vertical mot beam propagates collinearly with the atoms , complicating the desired optical pumping distribution and driving the atoms weakly while they are coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "we are unable to access the regime of collective strong coupling in this system , due to the small number of atoms that couple fully to the cavity mode .",
    "this is primarily due to the distribution of transverse velocities of the atoms coming from the lvis , which results in a broadening spatial profile and lower atom density as the beam propagates . to increase the single atom coupling we decrease the mode volume by a factor of two and keep the decay rate of the cavity increasing the finesse also by a factor of two",
    "however , the reduction of the volume complicates the collective strong coupling .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section 2 talks about the progress in the construction of the new optical cavity . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss deflection of an lvis by a 2-d optical molasses ( om ) .",
    "we explore the possibility of focusing an atomic beam in section 4 , and we end with conclusions in section 5 .",
    "at the heart of every optical cavity qed apparatus lies a high finesse ( low loss ) resonator . as the optical transmission coefficients for",
    "the mirrors used in the resonator may be as low as a few parts per million , reducing the absorptive losses to this level is a great experimental challenge .",
    "our present cavity ( decay rate @xmath6 s@xmath7 and finesse of 11,000 ) suffers from higher than expected losses , reducing its finesse by about a factor of two from the intended value ( @xmath125,000 , as calculated using the reflectivity of the mirrors ) .",
    "we believe the losses are due to adhesive residue inadvertently deposited on the mirror surfaces during construction , as well as the aging of the high - reflectivity coatings over the nearly two decades since deposition .",
    "we are constructing a new cavity with small and well - characterized losses , as well as slightly stronger coupling to the atoms and enhanced vibration isolation .",
    "two spherical mirrors with research electro - optics ( reo ) high - reflectivity coatings form the cavity . for precise alignment , these circular mirrors sit in a square groove machined into a single piece of macor , a low - outgassing  @xcite , machinable ceramic that can withstand high temperatures .",
    "the macor is adhered atop two separate piezoelectric transducers ( pzts ) , bridging the 2 mm gap between them . with the macor affixed to the pzts and the pzts affixed to a stainless steel base",
    ", we cut the macor piece in two , thereby allowing for independent translation of each half of the cavity .",
    "it is desireable to cut the macor with minimal force , so as to avoid putting stress on the pzts or comprimising the alignment of the groove in the macor .",
    "this procedure provides good alignment of the macor grooves between the two halves , so that simply resting the mirrors in the grooves before gluing keeps the reflective surfaces parallel . to maintain high vacuum ( @xmath8 torr or lower ) with the cavity",
    "mount inserted in the chamber , we use only adhesives that nasa rates as low - outgassing based on percent total mass loss at low pressure  @xcite such as loctite hysol 1c . in place of solder , we use epo - tek h20e , a silver - filled electrically conductive low - outgassing epoxy , to bond the pzts to wires and the stainless steel base .",

    "we aim to construct a cavity with coupling in the intermediate regime ( i.e. cavity decay rate @xmath9 of the same order as single - atom coupling rate @xmath10 and spontaneous emission rate @xmath11 ) , and with a finesse of about 20,000 .",
    "after nearly two decades of aging , the reo mirrors require direct measurement of their transmission properties in order to determine the expected finesse .",
    "we use a 5 mw , 780 nm laser beam and a mounted optical power meter to measure the intensity transmission coefficient @xmath12 directly .",
    "a 780 nm filter reduces background light into the detector to below 0.01 nw . after measuring the power of the unimpeded beam",
    ", we move a mirror into the path of the laser such that it is incident on the coated side , and the mirror reflects the majority of the power back through the optical isolator before the laser .",
    "finally , we use an aperture after the mirror to carefully block as much of the scatter as possible ( without clipping the transmitted beam itself ) , and record the intensity of transmitted light . taking the ratio of the transmitted optical power to the incident optical power ( over several independent trials )",
    ", we determine the current transmissions of the high - reflectivity mirrors .",

    "( [ finesse ] ) @xmath16 these directly measured transmissions give an expected finesse of @xmath120,000 .",
    "we use a method of impedance mismatching in which the stainless steel cavity mount sits atop a stack of materials with very different resonant frequencies , such that vibrations do not easily propagate through the entire stack , to improve the mechanical decoupling of the cavity .",
    "the materials include lead , copper , and sorbothane ( a shock absorbing synthetic viscoelastic urethane polymer ) . in order to find the optimal configuration of the materials , we place the cavity base atop a test stack and use a pzt attached to the base as a microphone , connecting its output to a spectrum analyzer ( stanford research systems sr770 fft network analyzer ) .",
    "we then strike the tabletop with a hammer , delivering controlled `` delta function '' impulses , several times over a span of ten seconds .",
    "we collect pzt voltage and average the spectrum over a range of frequencies from 0 to 100 khz , and we compare dozens of different combinations of damping materials .",
    "we obtain a drastic improvement to the effectiveness of the damping stack by altering the geometry of the sorbothane layer , based on advice from the manufacturers of sorbothane  @xcite . instead of a solid sheet of sorbothane",
    ", we cut the material into twelve roughly 0.25-inch squares , and space the squares out over the area of the damping stack .",

    "the benefits of deflection are threefold : it rids us of the unwanted mot light , it allows for better control of the atom number , and it provides a way to lower the average speed of the atoms traversing the cavity mode .",
    "the latter translates into longer transit times for the atoms in the cavity mode .",
    "a pair of retro - reflected laser beams , intersecting at right angles in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane , create a 2-d optical molasses ( see fig .  [ molasses ] ) .",
    "the molasses acts as a viscous damping force of form @xmath19 , opposing the motion of the atoms in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane , and rapidly damping the velocity in these directions , @xmath20 , to a mean of zero . aiming the initial atom beam from the lvis at some angle with respect to the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 axes ,",
    "the molasses damps all velocity components except those along @xmath21 , giving an effective deflection into the @xmath21 direction while also reducing the mean longitudinal velocity of the beam .",
