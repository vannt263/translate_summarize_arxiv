    "improved understanding of microparticle adhesion has implications for applied areas including self - assembly @xcite , laser cleaning of semiconductors @xcite , powder processing @xcite , and drug delivery @xcite .",
    "one method to study microparticle adhesion is to use laser - generated acoustic waves to eject the particles from a surface .",
    "this method has previously been used to study the adhesion of disordered assemblies of particles adhered to substrates @xcite . a closely related technique , which is typically used to study interfacial adhesion of thin films , is laser - induced spallation @xcite , wherein , a laser - generated acoustic compression pulse reflects from the free surface of the sample as a tensile pulse that causes delamination near the surface .",
    "in this work , we study the delamination of semi - ordered microsphere monolayers adhered to an aluminum - coated glass substrate , which contains both hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) and disordered domains , using a laser - induced spallation technique .",
    "the particle - substrate adhesive force is estimated by monitoring the time - resolved displacements of the surface of a substrate without the microsphere monolayer via optical inteferometry , and applying a rigid - body model that accounts for the microsphere inertia .",
    "we compare the estimated adhesive force with estimations based on measurements of the out - of - plane contact resonance of the microspheres obtained using optical inteferometry @xcite .",

    "a monolayer of @xmath4 @xmath0 m diameter polystyrene ( ps ) microspheres are assembled on the top of the aluminum - coated substrate using a modified langmuir - blodgett technique @xcite , in which the microspheres are self - assembled at an air - water interface and then transferred to the substrate .",

    "we observe the arrival of an acoustic pulse of greater than @xmath13 ns duration traveling at the longitudinal sound speed in the glass .",
    "we obtain the acceleration of the substrate by numerically differentiating the measured substrate displacement twice , and applying numerical smoothing to the displacement , velocity , and acceleration signals @xcite .",
    "an example of such an acceleration profile , corresponding to a pump energy of @xmath12 mj , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1]c .    to calculate the force acting at the particle - substrate contact ,",
    "we employ a simple model that accounts for the inertia of the microspheres and considers the microspheres to be rigid bodies that follow the substrate surface motion until detachment @xcite .",
    "we calculate the force applied to the contact as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the microsphere mass , calculated using a density provided by the manufacturer ( corpuscular , inc . ) of @xmath16 g / m^3^ , and @xmath17 is the measured substrate acceleration .",
    "this type of model is valid when the pulse duration is significantly longer than the period of the microsphere contact resonance ( a vibrational mode where the microsphere moves like a rigid body , but has localized deformation around the point of contact that acts as a spring @xcite ) .",
    "if the maximum tensile force induced at the contact exceeds the adhesive force , microsphere detachment occurs .",
    "the maximum tensile force obtained from the acceleration profile is plotted against pump energy in fig .",

    "[ figure3]b . at a pump energy of @xmath20 mj ,",
    "the amount of monolayer delamination increases , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c . since the adhesive force is expected to have a statistical variation throughout the monolayer @xcite , it is not surprising that some patches of monolayer remain adhered to the surface near the onset of microsphere removal .",
    "we also observe that detached monolayer flakes resettle on the sample surface .",
    "resettling of ejected particles has been observed previously by others @xcite , despite the plane of the sample s surface being oriented vertically .",
    "this was explained by the slowing of ejected particles by the stokes drag in air , while long range attractive forces eventually cause some particles to re - adhere to the surface @xcite .",
    "we find that almost all of the delaminated flakes are composed of single hcp crystalline domains .",
    "we suggest that fracture of the monolayer into flakes is the result of interparticle decohesion along the weak boundaries that develop during the spallation process . in previous spallation experiments with continuous , ductile thin films ,",
    "the excessive stress tended to lead to large scale plastic deformation in the film manifested by `` blister '' formation following the film delamination @xcite .",

    "we relate the resonant frequency to the contact stiffness by assuming the spheres act as a spring mass oscillator with resonant frequency @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 . by linearizing the hertzian contact model around the equilibrium contact area , we obtain the adhesive force in terms of the contact stiffness , @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the adhesive force , @xmath30 is the effective modulus , defined as @xmath31^{-1}$ ] , and r is the effective radius of curvature of the contact ( equal to the microsphere radius for spherical - planar contact geometry ) @xcite .",
