    "this paper is a forward modeling investigation of the plasma dynamics of polar plumes .",
    "these so - called `` polar rays '' or polar plumes ( e.g. , van de hulst 1950 ; saito 1958 ; harvey 1965 ; koutchmy , 1977 ; deforest et al .",
    "1997 ) trace open magnetic field lines to different heights depending on observation type . in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) emission line spectroheliograms , plumes appear as short spikes near the polar limb ( bohlin et al . 1975a ; ahmad & withbroe 1977 ; widing & feldman 1992 ; walker et al .",
    "1993 ) with unchanged shape and sudden brightness changes over typical lifetimes ranging from several hours to days ( see deforest et al . 1997 ; del  zanna et al .",
    "euv observations can be used to characterize the bases of polar plumes and also their plasma characteristics ( densities , temperatures , flows , abundances , etc . ) and also other processes such as heating , wave propagation , etc .",
    "( e.g. bohlin et al .",
    "1975b ; walker et al .",
    "1988 , 1993 ) .",
    "soft x - rays show mainly the hot plasma at the foot - points of the plumes ( e.g. , ahmad & webb , 1978 ) that are also seen as weak radio sources ( gopalswamy et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "deforest et al . ( 1997 , 2001a ) have shown that most white light polar rays can be associated directly with the euv polar plumes and their foot - points on the solar surface .",
    "above the solar limb , polar plumes appear brighter than the surrounding media , suggesting that they are denser than the background corona or inter - plume regions ( e.g. van de hulst 1950 ; saito 1958 & 1965 ; etc ) .",
    "the coronal - background electron density is about @xmath2 @xmath3 and falls sharply with height ( see different density models in raouafi & solanki 2006 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the density of polar plumes ranges from @xmath4 @xmath3 ( del  zanna et al .",
    "1997 ; young et al . 1999 ) .",
    "young et al . ( 1999 ) reported electron densities corresponding to the strong brightenings at plume foot - points of the order of @xmath5 @xmath3 and found no decrease with height up to 70 mm .",
    "they also inferred temperatures of the order of 2 mk . in a recent publication , wilhelm ( 2006 ) using off - limb spectroscopic measurements from the spectrometer sumer ( wilhelm et al .",
    "1995 ) on board soho ( domingo et al . 1995 ) found that plumes are approximately 5 - 6 times denser than inter - plume regions up to @xmath6 .",
    "the plume - interplume density ratio changes little in this height range . note that these are off - limb measurements and they do not take into account the plume area projected on the solar disk .    the contribution of polar plumes to the fast solar wind arising from the polar coronal holes has been a subject of debate and controversy . in general , plumes are thought to harbor smaller outflow speeds than inter - plume regions ( e.g. , habbal 1992 ; wang 1994 ; hassler et al .",
    "1999 ; etc ) .",
    "thus , polar plumes observed above the solar limb seem to be nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium and show small or no line shifts , suggesting that the bulk of the acceleration of the solar wind takes place at larger heights ( see del  zanna et al .",
    "1997 ; kohl et al . 1997 ; wilhelm et al . 2000 ; teriaca et al . 2003 ) .",
    "doppler dimming techniques applied to soho / uvcs ( kohl et al .",
    "1995 ) observations of the lines have shown outflows in inter - plume dark lanes ranging from 100 to 150 km  s@xmath7 at @xmath8 from sun center and smaller speeds in bright plumes ( 0 - 65 km  s@xmath7 ; see giordano et al .",
    "however , gabriel et al . ( 2003 ) used the doppler dimming technique applied to soho / sumer data and found the intensity ratio of the doublet to be smaller in plumes than in inter - plumes .",
    "they concluded that outflow speeds of the solar wind are greater in plumes than in inter - plumes .",
    "unfortunately , they did not analyze line profiles , in particular the line widths , on which the doppler dimming effect depends .",
    "euv coronal emissions in spectral lines that are formed within narrow temperature ranges are excellent temperature diagnostics for different coronal structures .",
    "soho / eit ( delaboudinire et al .",
    "1995 ) images ( 195   that forms at @xmath9 mk and /@xmath10 171   at @xmath11 mk ) reveal that plumes are cooler than the background corona ( deforest et al .",
    "1997 ; young et al . 1999 ) .",
    "spectral analysis have also shown that uv lines are narrower in plumes than in inter - plume regions ( e.g. 1032   line widths are 10 - 15% lower ; hassler et al .",
    "1997 ; etc ) .",
    "this suggests that the plume material is relatively cooler than or has less turbulence than dark lane plasma ( inter - plume regions ) .",
    "wilhelm et al . ( 1998 ) used intensity ratios of temperature sensitive lines for accurate measurements of temperatures in the low corona .",
    "they found evidence for an increasing temperature with height in the background corona , but no rise of temperature in plumes ( see also young et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the geometry of plumes is an important key in understanding their contribution to the fast solar wind .",
    "the high - speed solar wind at even moderate solar latitudes is thought to originate within coronal holes at high latitudes and to be affected by superradial expansion of the coronal hole magnetic field ( zirker 1977 ) . from white light observations plumes",
    "are thought to also expand superradially with altitude ( ahmad & withbroe 1977 ; munro & jackson 1977 ; fisher & guhathakurta 1995 ) .",
    "deforest et al . ( 1997 ) found that plumes expand highly superradially ( with a half - cone angle of 45 ) in their lowest 20 - 30 mm , and more slowly above .",
    "deforest et al . ( 2001b ) also found that below @xmath12 plumes expand superradially at the same rate as the background coronal hole .",
    "however , woo &  habbal ( 1999 ) and woo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have claimed to observe radial , rather than superradial , expansion of plumes in the coronal holes .",
    "speculation on interaction between plume and inter - plume material has been reported , in particular at high altitudes in the corona .",
    "saito and tanaka ( 1957a , b ) were the first to associate plumes with magnetic flux concentrations ( faculae ) in the polar regions .",
    "polar plumes arise from footpoints 2 - 4 mm ( @xmath13 ) wide and expand rapidly with height ( see deforest et al .",
    "a simulation has shown that a typical plume width at the base of the corona is 20 to 28 mm ( klaus wilhelm , private communication ) .",
    "several authors ( harvey 1965 ; newkirk & harvey 1968 ; lindblom 1990 ; allen 1994 ; etc . ) have suggested that polar plumes arise mainly from unipolar magnetic structures coinciding with the supergranular network boundaries",
    ". however , deforest et al . (",
    "1997 ) have shown that not all of the flux concentrations give rise to polar plumes .",
    "other authors suggest that unipolar magnetic flux concentrations reconnect with ephemeral emergent flux having opposite polarity ( saito 1965 ; wang 1994 , 1998 ; wang & sheeley 1995 ; etc ) .",
    "this is supported by the high temperature observed at the plume footpoints , producing high pressure plasma from the dipole that can escape along open field lines .",
    "deforest et al . ( 2001b ) found that polar plumes are of episodic nature : `` polar plumes are both transient and persistent : they are recurring structures that brighten for only 1 day but reappear at approximately the same location for up to 2 - 3 weeks '' .",
    "they speculate that this behavior is the result of multiple magnetic reconnections of the unipolar flux concentrations at the network boundaries encountering multiple ephemeral dipoles driven by supergranular motion .",
    "we consider model plumes having different outflow speeds and turbulence and calculate the line profile shape of the plume plasma .",
    "we use the observed profile shapes of the lines as primary criteria to select the appropriate height variation of those quantities .",
    "we then refine them to reproduce the other measured quantities , i.e. line widths , total intensities and intensity ratios .",
    "in the following sections , we study the effect of polar plume locations along the line of sight on the line profiles and intensities of the doublet and ly@xmath0 .",
    "the comparison with the observed quantities deduced from soho / uvcs spectra allows us to constrain the dynamic properties of the plasma inside plumes . in section 2 , we present a summary of plume spectroscopic observations by soho / uvcs and highlight the spectral properties of 1032   .",
    "a polar plume model is described in section 3 and the results from this model are presented and discussed in sections 4 - 7 .",
    "conclusions and prospects are to be found in section 8 .",
    "a preliminary version of some of the results has been reported by raouafi et al .",
    "the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ; kohl et al .",
    "1995 ) has provided important spectral information on coronal lines in polar holes .",
    "the main spectral lines recorded by uvcs are ly@xmath0 , the doublet at 103  nm and the doublet centered at around 61  nm ( in the order of decreasing emission ) .",
    "spectral analysis of uvcs data has shown that  ly@xmath0 has , to a good approximation , a gaussian shape at all heights accessible to this instrument .",
    "kohl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) pointed out small deviations from gaussians at the profile peaks , allowing for two line components resulting from the contributions of different plasma media with different properties along the los .",
    "giordano et al . (",
    "1997 ) have also shown that ly@xmath0 profiles are narrower when ray paths intersect high density structures ( plumes ) than otherwise ( inter - plumes ) .",
    "the change with height of the line profiles is more complex than for ly@xmath0 . while at low altitudes ( say below @xmath14 ) the observed profiles are relatively gaussian shaped , with small deviations in the wings and peaks , more pronounced deviations of the observed profiles from a single gaussian are clearly seen in the observations at higher altitudes up to about @xmath15 . at this height , the profiles are well represented by two gaussian components : a narrow and a broad one .",
    "the latter appears to be associated with regions of low density ( inter - plume regions ) while the narrow component shows a clear association with the denser regions along the los ( higher emission regions : e.g. , polar plumes ) .",
    "the spectral behavior of the two components as a function of height above the limb is quite different .",
    "the width of the broad component increases dramatically with height , while that of the narrow one remains almost constant ( see kohl et al .",
    "1997 ; 1999 ) .",
    "lines have a narrow component at @xmath16 , accounting for only a small fraction of the observed spectral radiance . for higher altitudes ,",
    "the observations are not good enough to distinguish whether or not a narrow coronal component exists .",
    "kohl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown also that the @xmath17 values for the narrow components of and are smaller than those for 1216   at the same heights , and the narrow value is smaller than that of .    at the solar activity",
    "minimum the polar coronal holes are well developed and bordering streamers appear not to reach the uvcs observation altitudes , making it very likely that narrow components are contributions of fine structures inside the polar coronal hole .",
    "polar plumes are the most prominent features at the heights at which uvcs observes , which makes them the main source of the narrow component observed in the spectral lines .    figs .",

    "[ september19 - 231997 ] ) and @xmath20 ( fig .  [ june031996 ] ) away from the north pole .",
    "the profiles in the first figure are formed of two distinct components ( narrow and broad ) .",
    "two gaussians are needed to give satisfactory fits to the profiles at @xmath21 and partly also around @xmath22 , although with a small contribution of the narrow component .",
    "however , the profiles in the second figure are very close to a gaussian in shape , although they show a small degree of asymmetry .",
    "thus , the spectral profiles depend relatively strongly on the distance of the plume footpoints to the pole and also on to the brightness of the plume . in other words",
    ", they depend on where the plume crosses the los at a given altitude .",
    "this difference in the profile shapes is a valuable tool to study plasma dynamic in these coronal fine structures .",
    "the characteristics of the plumes spectral contribution ( narrow component ) to lines as observed by uvcs are summarized as follows :    * dominates the profiles below @xmath23 and decreases above ; * not seen in the profiles beyond @xmath24 .",
    "only the broad component remains above this altitude .",
    "note that the noise level in the profiles increases with height , which might screen small contributions from fine coronal structures along the los ; * mostly located at the center of the broad component which is close to the rest wavelength of the spectral lines .",
    "thus , no significant doppler shifts are observed for the narrow component ; * the width of narrow component hardly changes as function of height in the range where this latter is observed ( see kohl et al .",
    "in order to study the influence of polar plumes on the los - integrated profiles of and , we consider a number of plumes aligned along the los , with foot points placed at different angular locations in the polar coronal hole ( see fig .",
    "[ ppmes_spat_dist ] ) .",
    "the importance of the angular locations of the plume footpoints is enhanced because of the superradial expansion of the magnetic field .",

    "in addition , we showed previously that plume wind speeds faster or just close to inter - plume speeds give line profiles different from those observed in the polar coronal holes . here",

    "( 1999 ) observed similar deviations and interpreted them as due to the contribution of polar plumes .",

    "[ ppmes_spat_dist ] taken into account separately .",
    "the contributions from the two polar plumes based at colatitude @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( the narrow component of the line profile ) dominate the profiles up to @xmath78 and remain clearly visible up to @xmath100 ( dotted and solid lines ) which is not the case for the observed profiles .",
    "the reason for the continuing visibility of the truly polar plumes up to large altitudes is that the rapid acceleration of the solar wind in the plume hardly affects the plume profile , since it is almost perpendicular to the los .",
    "the contribution from the plume at @xmath101 is important at low altitudes but relatively small at high altitudes ( dashed lines ) .",
    "this suggests that polar plumes preferentially originate more than @xmath102 away from the pole .",
    "the contribution from the plume with footpoint at @xmath103 ( dot - dashed lines ) is very similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ june031996 ] due to plumes at @xmath20 from the solar pole .",
    "various authors have studied locations of polar plume foot - points within polar regions .",
    "they traced plumes arising near the edges of coronal holes , relatively far away from the solar pole ( eclipse observations ; see saito 1965 ) .",
    "in contrast , we did not find any report on plumes very close to the polar axis .",
    "this case may be very rare for unknown physical reasons ( for example , bipolar flux may not emerge near the pole ) .",
    "polar coronal plumes can be easily identified off - limb in white light ( lasco , eclipses ) and euv ( eit , trace ) images . on the solar disk , for instance by using eit images , it is also possible to trace them back to the solar surface , in particular , using images recorded in the wavelength bands containing the hot lines 171   and 195   that are regularly recorded by eit .",
    "x - ray images also allow the determination of the locations of plume foot - points , that correspond very often to bright points reflecting the high temperatures there .",
    "once the plume foot - points are identified , it is relatively easy to link them to the underlying magnetic structures using magnetograms .",
    "data recorded daily over several consecutive days or better still weeks help to survey the latitudes of polar plume foot - points . for this purpose ,",
    "periods of time when the solar axis is tilted toward the observer are more useful since the observation of a major area of the polar coronal hole including the pole is possible .",
    "these times correspond to march and september of each year .",
    "eit images recorded at solar minimum seem to support this hypothesis .",
    "an average of all daily unsigned solis ( synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ) high sensitivity magnetograms recorded in september 2005 ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ footpoints_fig ] ) show magnetic flux concentrations preferentially between @xmath104 and @xmath105 latitude , although we are not at solar minimum yet .",
    "another reason why plumes are more likely to have their footpoints some degrees away from the pole has got to do with the relative area available for plumes between 70 and @xmath106 is 3 times larger than at latitudes above @xmath106 .",
    "however , preliminary analysis of solis magnetograms tends not to support the area argument .",
    "this subject will be addressed in detail in a subsequent publication .",
    "the aim of the present study is to obtain information on the height evolution of the plasma dynamics inside polar plumes .",
    "we compared profile shapes of the doublet ( 1032 and 1037   ) and the ly@xmath0 spectral lines observed by soho / uvcs at different altitudes in polar coronal holes to synthetic profiles that include the contribution of polar plumes placed at different locations along the los .",
    "observational constraints on these fine coronal structures ( densities , temperatures , geometry , ... ) have been taken into account following different reports in the literature .",
    "since the outflow speed and kinetic temperature evolution with height are not conclusively known , we consider different height profiles for the outflow speed and plasma turbulence inside plumes and study how these choices influence the line profiles of the doublet , which are more sensitive to the detailed dynamic structure along the los than  ly@xmath0 .    by comparing the synthetic profiles to the observed ones in the polar coronal holes , we determined plausible height profiles for the outflow speed and plasma turbulence in polar plumes with respect to the surrounding background corona .",
    "we find that models with constant ( height - independent ) velocity turbulence in the plumes show narrow components with a significant contribution to the los - integrated profile at all heights , in particular above @xmath107 where there is no observational indication of the presence of such a narrow component in the observed profiles .",
    "this is independent of whether the plume outflow speed equals a constant or a height - dependent fraction of the inter - plume outflow speed .",
    "synthetic profiles with shapes very similar to the observed ones are obtained when the plasma turbulence in plumes is height - dependent with similar variation to that in inter - plume regions and converges towards the latter at greater heights . at the same time , the outflow speed is small near the solar surface , but approaches the inter - plume value at greater heights .",
    "the narrow component is found to contribute significantly to the resultant profiles at altitudes below @xmath108 and is increasingly dimmed above that altitude .",
    "this model suggests that the plume plasma remains much slower and cooler ( in the sense that @xmath109 ) than inter - plume material up to @xmath110 . above @xmath110",
    "these parameters experience a rapid rise towards inter - plume values reached by @xmath111 .",
    "the rapid acceleration and increase in the effective temperature of the plasma inside plumes is probably the result of interaction with the faster and hotter inter - plume material .",
    "the entrainment or mixing of material between plumes and inter - plumes is hindered by the magnetic field .",
    "the smaller the magnetic energy density relative to the thermal or the kinetic energy density , the more efficiently entrainment takes place .",
    "now consider the following numbers : from @xmath112 to @xmath113 the density @xmath114 decreases by a factor of approximately @xmath115 , while the area of a plume increases by roughly @xmath116 .",
    "consequently the kinetic energy density , @xmath117 , remains roughly constant over this height range , while the magnetic energy density , @xmath118 drops by roughly a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "this may explain why the plum properties remain distinct from those of the inter - plume gas up to about @xmath113 and then start to merge .",
    "as far as the actual interaction is concerned , it may be enhanced by , e.g. , the kelvin - helmholtz instability which can act at the boundary between two streams with sufficiently different speeds .",
    "in addition electron collisions may not be sufficient at heights @xmath119 to keep the different species in equilibrium . consequently , plume species are heated and accelerated differently and rapidly as the density drops sharply with height",
    ". this may not be the case below this altitude where the density is high enough to keep all species in equilibrium contrasting inter - plumes regions where the ( electron ) density is smaller allowing for the plasma equilibrium to brake down at lower altitudes and thus the hotter and faster plasma compared to plume regions .",
    "we find that observed profile shapes , line widths and total intensities of the doublet and of ly@xmath0 are better reproduced when the influence of appropriate plumes is included . in particular , the intensity ratios of the doublet below @xmath74 are smaller when the plume contribution is taken into account .",
    "this is due to the density enhancement in the plume region .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the interpretation preferred by gabriel et al .",
    "( 2003 & 2005 ) that such a reduction in the ratio is due to the doppler dimming effect , which would imply a higher outflow speed in plumes than in inter - plume regions . in our analysis , such high outflow speeds in the plumes",
    "produce synthetic profiles whose narrow component is doppler shifted towards a profile wing , in contrast to the observations .",
    "it is noteworthy that including polar plumes increases the agreement of the computed profiles with the observed ones and with critical parameters like line width or line ratio even if no anisotropy in the temperature ( or turbulence velocity ) is included in the computations .",
    "note that the properties of the plumes were constrained basically using the line profile shape only and the quantitative comparison with the line parameters and ratio was only carried out later .",
    "this strengthens the thesis put forward by raouafi & solanki ( 2004 & 2006 ) that there is no compelling need for large anisotropies in temperature in coronal holes based on published uvcs data .",
    "note that we have not tried to optimally reproduce the observed quantities by carrying out an exhaustive search in parameter space .",
    "thus the obtained results can possibly be improved further by applying a @xmath120 minimization procedure to fit the line profiles .    plumes with footpoints within @xmath19 of the pole display significant narrow components even at altitudes above @xmath78 , contrary to the observations .",
    "eit images during the solar minimum together with high sensitivity magnetograms from solis show evidence supporting the hypothesis that plumes originate away from the pole .",
    "this subject will be studied in detail in a subsequent paper .",
