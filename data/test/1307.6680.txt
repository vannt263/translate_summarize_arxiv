    "recently , quantum correlation in low - dimensional systems has attracted much attention .",
    "one the one hand , quantum correlation plays a central role in the formation of various condense matter phases at low temperatures .",
    "it helps us to understand these phases and the so - called quantum phase transitions(qpts).@xcite for example , for various models it has been found quantum correlation is maximum or singular in the vicinity of the transition points.@xcite on the other hand , quantum correlation is regarded as valuable resource for quantum information communication and quantum computation.@xcite    the most famous features of quantum correlation are quantum entanglement and nonlocality . entanglement is defined on the separability - entanglement paradigm.@xcite for example , the two - qubit pure state @xmath0 is separable , since it can be expressed as the product of the single - site states @xmath1 .",
    "however , most states can not be expressed as such a product form , e.g. , the superposition of two separable states @xmath2 .",
    "they are called entangled states .",
    "the entanglement measurement is usually defined in the bipartite setting , such as entanglement concurrence and entanglement entropy .",
    "recently , it has been recognized that entanglement can be generalized to multipartite settings.@xcite    besides entanglement , nonlocality is also an important feature of quantum correlation , which is described by the violation of bell inequalities@xcite .",
    "we consider some expression @xmath3 , namely , a function for the state @xmath4 .",
    "we will called it a bell function .",
    "for all the states described by a realistic local theory , we can always identify the upper bound @xmath5 for @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , for any local state @xmath4 , it should hold @xmath6 it is just a bell inequality .",
    "for some state @xmath4 , suppose @xmath3 turns out to be larger than @xmath5 , we will say that the bell inequality is violated , thus @xmath4 can not be characterized by any realistic local theory , i.e. , @xmath4 is a non - local state .",
    "a widely used bell inequality is proposed by clauser , horne , shimony and holt , namely , the chsh inequality.@xcite theoretically , numerical optimization can be used to identify the upper bound @xmath5 .",
    "fortunately , a closed analytical formula of the bell inequality for two - qubit states has been found by horodecki.@xcite    nonlocality and entanglement were regarded as similar concepts for years .",
    "however , an entangled state may not violate any bell inequality.@xcite for example , for several matrix product states , we found that the two - qubit states do not violate bell inequality but they are entangled.@xcite thus , nonlocality and entanglement capture different aspects of quantum correlation .",
    "in fact , there even exists some kind of quantum correlation , which can not be characterized by nonlocality and entanglement , as we will show in this paper .",
    "quite recently , it has been found that bell function can be used to indicate qpts for many one - dimensional quantum systems.@xcite it is interesting that it even can be used for topological qpt@xcite and kosterlitz - thouless qpt@xcite , which are difficult to capture by traditional order parameters .",
    "previous studies about bell inequality and nonlocality are limited to qpts in one - dimensional systems .",
    "surprisingly , for various systems it turns out that the bell inequality is not violated.@xcite it is recently realized that such an unexpected result is related to the monogamy trade - off obeyed by bipartite bell function . as a result , in translation invariant systems ,",
    "nonlocality should not be violated in general.@xcite based on this consideration , two - dimensional systems would be more suitable for preparing and then studying nonlocality .",
    "firstly , two - dimensional systems have complex topology and a perfect translation - invariance symmetry is usually absent .",
    "thus , the nonlocality can be present in the systems .",
    "secondly , two - dimensional systems undergo not only qpts at zero temperature , but also thermal phase transitions at finite temperatures .",
    "the study of nonlocality in thermal phase transitions would of course increase our understanding of quantum correlation and phase transitions .    in this paper",
    ", we will study bell inequality and nonlocality in a two - dimensional heisenberg - ising mixed spin system.@xcite firstly , it is exactly soluble , thus we can concentrate on physics rather than mathematical calculation .",
    "secondly , the model has a rich phase diagram . at zero temperature",
    "the system has an ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase and a quantum anti - ferromagnetic ( qaf ) phase , and a first - order qpt happens between the two phases . at finite temperatures ,",
    "ordered ground states will be destroyed by thermal fluctuation , and the system will enter the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase . as a result , the system will undergo second - order thermal phase transition from the ordered magnetic phases to pm phase at finite temperatures .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is firstly identified by investigating the spin - spin correlation functions.@xcite recently , the system is investigated with the help of modern quantum information tools,@xcite and some issues remain unresolved . in the fm phase quantum entanglement",
    "turns out to be absent , however , quantum correlation is found to be present , indicated by the discord ( discord measures all the quantum correlation in a quantum state).@xcite it is natural to ask , what is the intuitive form of the quantum correlation in the fm phase of the model ? can it be characterized by nonlocality ? this is another motivation for us to investigate the nonlocality in this model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly introduce the model and basic formula . in sec .",
    "3 , we study the relationship between bell function and various phase transitions in the model . in sec . 4",
    ", we discuss the properties of bipartite correlation in the system by analyzing nonlocality and other measures such as entanglement .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "firstly , let s introduce horodecki s criterion @xcite for nonlocality , which provides a closed analytic expression for the bell inequality for any two - qubit state @xmath4 .",
    "we defines a matrix @xmath7 as @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are just pauli matrices .",
    "then one finds the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "finally , for any state described by a realistic local theory , the bell inequality reads @xmath13    though the mathematical procedure seems to be complex , @xmath3 can be obtained analytically for any given two - qubit state @xmath4 .",
    "as we will show , @xmath3 is just related to two correlation functions of the system .      in order to characterize the properties of the bipartite correlation",
    ", we will further calculate the entanglement concurrence.@xcite concurrence describes the pairwise entanglement between the two sites .",
    "firstly , one defines a matrix @xmath14 as @xmath15 , then the concurrence is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath18 in decreasing order .",
    "one can easily prove that the concurrence for the state @xmath0 is zero , i.e. , it is separable , while the concurrence for the state @xmath2 is @xmath19 , i.e. , it is maximally entangled .",
    "we consider an exactly soluble two - dimensional mixed spin model firstly considered by j. strecka.@xcite the lattice ( see fig . [",
    "fig : topo ] ) contains two kinds of spins : the ising spins @xmath20 and the heisenberg spins @xmath21 , denoted by white dots and black dots , respectively .",
    "four continuous spins forms a bond , labeled by @xmath22 , and different bonds are connected with each other by the ising spins .",
    "the two adjacent heisenberg spins on bond @xmath22 have typical anisotropic heisenberg interaction @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the coupling parameter and @xmath25 the anisotropy parameter , and the adjacent heisenberg and ising spins of bond @xmath22 have an ising type interaction , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the totally hamiltonian of the system is given by    @xmath27    where the summation is over all bonds .",
    "at zero temperature the system has two phases , i.e. , a qaf phase and an fm phase , and a first - order phase transition separates the two from each other .",
    "the phase boundary is located at @xmath28.@xcite at finite temperatures , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition from the qaf phase to the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase for @xmath29 . while for @xmath30 , an fm - pm thermal phase transition will be observed . in this paper ,",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , thus the qpt is located at @xmath33 .",
    "the topology of the two - dimensional mixed spin model . ]",
    "we just pay our attention to the two adjacent heisenberg spins on a bond , in which quantum correlation is present . because of the symmetries of the system",
    ", the reduced density matrix @xmath4 of the two - spin subsystem should be expressed as:@xcite    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    with @xmath36,@xmath37,@xmath38 and @xmath39 . according to horodecki s formula",
    ", the bell inequality turns out to be    @xmath40    with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , to obtain the bell function , one just needs to evaluate @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "based upon the well - known existing results for two - dimensional ising model , the solution of @xmath43 and @xmath44 involves kambe projection method , the transfer matrix theory and several powerful spin identities .",
    "the calculation is rather lengthy .",
    "readers who are interested in the method can read j. strecka s paper.@xcite here we just give the final results as follows    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is just the spin - spin correlation function of the classical two - dimensional ising model , which can be found on j. strecka s paper and the corresponding references.@xcite the coefficients @xmath47 are given by    @xmath48",
    "in this section , we discuss the ability of bell function in detecting the phase transitions in the model .",
    "firstly , we consider the qpt of the system . at zero temperature ( and low temperatures ) , the system is in the qaf phase for @xmath49 , and in the fm phase for @xmath50 . in fig . [",
    "fig : qpt ] we show the bell function as a function of @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "the bell function shows a sudden - change at @xmath53 .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath54 should result from the sudden - change of the density matrix , thus can be regarded as a reliable signal for a first - order phase transition . in addition , in the qaf phase , the value of the bell function is larger than 2 , thus the bell inequality is violated . while in the fm phase , the bell inequality is never violated .     the bell function @xmath54 at @xmath52 .",
    "it shows a sudden - change at @xmath53 . ]",
    "secondly , we study the behavior of the bell function in the thermal phase transitions at finite temperature .",
    "the system has a qaf - pm transition for @xmath49 , and an fm - pm transition for @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] we show the temperature dependence of the bell function in the qaf - pm transition .",
    "the derivative of @xmath54 is divergent at some critical temperatures .",
    "divergence of @xmath55 should result from continuous and dramatic change of the density matrix , thus can be regarded as a reliable signal for second - order phase transitions .",
    "in fact , we have checked that the location of the divergence of the bell function is indeed perfectly consistent with the divergent point of specific heat , thus the bell function indeed identifies exactly the location of the thermal phase transition .",
    "in addition , in low - temperature region , the bell function is larger than 2 .",
    "then , as the increase of the temperature , the bell function decreases gradually . and finally , the bell inequality is not violated at high - temperature regions .",
    "it shows that the nonlocality present at low temperatures is finally destroyed by thermal fluctuation .     the behavior of bell function in the qaf - pm thermal phase transition for several @xmath51 .",
    "the inset is the derivative of the bell function with respect to the temperature .",
    "the derivative of bell function is divergent at the critical temperature @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fm - pm ] we plot the behavior of bell function in the fm - pm thermal phase transition . just as in the qaf - pm transition in fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] , the derivative of @xmath54 shows a divergence at the second - order phase transition point .",
    "in addition , the derivative of bell function shows a discontinuity at @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "detailed study manifests that it just results from the max function in calculating the bell function , rather than a phase transition .     the behavior of bell function in the fm - pm thermal phase transition for several @xmath51 .",
    "the inset is the derivative of the bell function with respect to the temperature .",
    "the derivative of bell function is divergent at the critical temperature @xmath58 for @xmath61 and @xmath64 for @xmath63 . ]    in fact , according to sec .",
    "2 , the bell function is related to the spin - spin correlation functions as @xmath65 at the phase transition points , @xmath43 or @xmath44 can be singular .",
    "this is the mathematical reason why @xmath66 can be used to detect the phase transitions in this model .",
    "it needs mention that the density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) contains four free parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the singularity of any of these four parameters would indicate a phase transition of the system .",
    "in fact , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are just the traditional order parameters for the fm - pm and qaf - pm phase transitions , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath66 just contains the information of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it needs mention that the concurrence is a function of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath69.@xcite from a mathematical point of view , one may conclude that concurrence is better than the nonlocality in detecting phase transitions , since it contains more parameters in @xmath4 .",
    "however , it turns out that the concurrence @xmath70 is zero in the fm - pm transition,@xcite while @xmath66 is just zero in a very narrow parameter space and it indeed offers a singularity at the critical temperature .",
    "concurrence can only detect phase transitions in entangled states , while the bell function can capture signals of phase transition in non - local states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] ) and local states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fm - pm ] ) .    furthermore , the max function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocality_2d ] ) induces a non - physical singularity , i.e. , the discontinuity of @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] .",
    "this kind of singularity should not be regarded as a reliable signal of phase transitions , since it can results from either the singularity of the density matrix , or merely the max function .",
    "thus , if @xmath71 turns out to be discontinuous in some models , we need to be very careful to judge whether it is a critical temperature or not .",
    "this kind of discontinuity has been observed in other measures of correlation such as concurrence and discord.@xcite",
    "we calculate the bell function and the concurrence in the @xmath72 plane , and the corresponding contour maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the figure shows that weaker coupling and lower temperature will result in higher quantum correlation in this model .",
    "one can see that high nonlocality or high entanglement is present in the bottom left corner of the maps .",
    "the effect of coupling constant on quantum correlation is model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , the relationship between temperature and quantum correlation is more general , because thermal fluctuation will destroy quantum correlation . from fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] one sees that for most @xmath51 , as the temperature increases , both the nonlocality and concurrence will decrease gradually .    however , we find the nonlocality can be enlarged by thermal fluctuation in some parameter space . as indicated by the black arrow in fig . [",
    "fig : contour ] , the contour line for @xmath73 bends to the right . as a result , for an appropriate fixed @xmath51 , for example @xmath74 , when the temperature increases from zero",
    ", the bell function will cross the @xmath73 contour line from below , which means that the nonlocality is enhanced by thermal fluctuation . in the high - entanglement region in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ( b ) , e.g. , in the vicinity of the @xmath75 contour line , the concurrence is not enhanced by thermal fluctuation .",
    "the different behavior between nonlocality and entanglement shows that the two concepts indeed capture different aspects of quantum correlation .",
    "contour maps for the ( a ) nonlocality and ( b ) concurrence in the @xmath72 plane . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - regions ] , we divide the @xmath72 plane into several regions by considering the form of bipartite correlation in the system .",
    "the red line is just the contour line for @xmath76 , on the left side of which the system is non - local . in addition , the blue line is the contour line of @xmath77 , on the left side of which the system is entangled . finally , the whole @xmath72 plane is divided into three regions , labeled as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 . in region",
    "@xmath78 , both entanglement and nonlocality are present in the system . in region @xmath79 , the correlation is in the form of entanglement , rather than nonlocality . in region@xmath80 ,",
    "where the fm - pm phase transition happens , there is no nonlocality or entanglement in the system .",
    "however , in a previous study,@xcite we have found that quantum correlation is indeed present in the fm - pm phase transition by studying quantum discord .",
    "this result shows that the quantum correlation in region @xmath80 is very novel , which can not be characterized by entanglement or nonlocality .",
    "quite recently , some other measures of bipartite correlation have been developed , for example , the so - called measure @xmath81 for @xmath82 systems.@xcite these measures may offer further information about the quantum correlation in region @xmath80 .",
    "( color online ) the @xmath72 plane is divided into three regions by analyzing the presence / absence of nonlocality and entanglement . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the bipartite correlation in a two - dimensional mixed spin system .",
    "we have used the bell inequality to investigate the nonlocality in the system .",
    "firstly , bell function captures the signals for both the quantum phase transition and thermal phase transitions of the model . in the vicinity of zero temperature , the bell function @xmath66 shows a sudden - change at the transition point @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , at finite temperatures , @xmath71 is divergent at the transition temperatures .",
    "the bell function captures not just the location , but also the order , of these phase transitions .",
    "secondly , we find a novel type of quantum correlation , which can not be characterized by entanglement or nonlocality . in region @xmath80 of fig .",
    "[ fig : three - regions ] , the bell inequality is not violated , and the concurrence is zero . however",
    ", a previous study shows that there is indeed quantum correlation present in the system.@xcite recently developed tools such as the measure @xmath81 may be helpful to describe further physical picture for this kind of quantum correlation.@xcite    thirdly , we find the nonlocality can be enlarged by thermal fluctuation in the anti - ferromagnetic phase(see fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] ) . as in - depth discussion",
    "is needed , let s review several related papers first .",
    "in a one - dimensional diamond - like quantum spin model , the concurrence increases from @xmath83 to finite values when thermal fluctuation is increased gradually.@xcite similarly , for just the two - dimensional model studied in this paper , the discord , which is @xmath83 at zero temperature , is also enlarged by thermal fluctuation.@xcite it needs mention that , in these two situations , the ground states are ferromagnetic , i.e. @xmath84 , and all spins are parallel to each other , thus the quantum correlation is exactly zero at zero temperature . then , as the increase of the temperature , excited states are mixed into the density matrix .",
    "these excited states are usually complicated , and it is expected for them to bring some quantum correlation into the system .",
    "that s why thermal fluctuation can enhance correlation in ferromagnetic phases .",
    "however , our finding in this paper can not be explained by the above picture .",
    "the ground state of the system is anti - ferromagnetic in the parameter space @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , the system is in a highly non - local state .",
    "thus the enhancement of nonlocality by thermal fluctuation in fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf - pm ] is unusual . a possible approach to understand the behavior is to calculate low - lying states @xmath86 explicitly , and analyze the mixing process @xmath87 as the change of the temperature .",
    "we d like to mention that any qualitative discussion will be untenable , since the entanglement concurrence is not enlarged by the thermal fluctuation in the same parameter region .",
    "it suggests that quantum correlation phenomena , despite being extensively studied , is worthy of further investigation .",
