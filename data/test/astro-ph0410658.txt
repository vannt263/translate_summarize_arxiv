    "magnetic fields are ubiquitous in diverse astrophysical settings on various scales ranging from proto - stellar discs , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , microquasars , quasars , galaxies and grandiose astrophysical jets to clusters of galaxies . in some cases , magnetic fields are relatively weak so that dynamical processes are almost unaffected by their presence .",
    "however , there do exist numerous cases where magnetic fields are necessary and important for both dynamics and diagnostics , especially in spiral galaxies and accretion disc systems ( e.g. , sofue et al .",
    "1986 ; beck et al . 1996",
    "; balbus & hawley 1998 ; tagger & pellat 1999 ; widrow 2002 ) . in general , it is challenging to model magnetic fields realistically because of their complexities ( sofue et al .",
    "1986 ; kronberg 1994 ; caunt & tagger 2001 ; widrow 2002 ) . in the problems involving protostar formation and disc galaxies , shu & li ( 1997 ) presumed the so - called ` isopedic ' magnetic field configuration where the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio in a razor thin disc remains constant . using a singular isothermal disc ( sid ) model ( mestel 1963 ) that is isopedically magnetized",
    ", shu et al . ( 2000 ) studied stationary coplanar perturbations and proposed that these global modes are bifurcations to either secularly or dynamically unstable configurations .",
    "along a separate yet complementary line , lou ( 2002 ) studied an azimuthally magnetized singular isothermal disc ( msid ) and derived two different global stationary magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) perturbation modes . based on the msid model , lou ( 2002 ) explored the manifestation of interlaced optical and magnetic field spiral arms in the outer portion of a disc with a nearly flat rotation curve such as the case of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6946 ( beck & hoernes 1996 ; fan & lou 1996 ; lou & fan 1998a , 2002 ; frick et al . 2000 , 2001 ; lou et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in contexts of spiral galaxies ,",
    "it is natural and important to consider a composite disc system consisting of gravitationally coupled gaseous and stellar discs .",
    "this is because various physical processes on different scales occur in the gaseous disc yet large - scale gas dynamics and environment are significantly affected by large - scale structures in the stellar disc ( lou & fan 1998b ) . to construct global coplanar perturbation structures in a systematic manner",
    ", we started with a composite sid system of two fluid discs without magnetic field ( lou & shen 2003 ) to generalize the work of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a single sid . in terms of the global axisymmetric stability for such a composite sid system",
    ", we provided a more straightforward @xmath12criterion ( shen & lou 2003 ) in contrast to the axisymmetric stability criteria of elmegreen ( 1995 ) and jog ( 1996 ) . to be more general than a background sid profile , we recently constructed global stationary perturbation patterns in a composite system of two fluid scale - free discs without magnetic field ( shen & lou 2004a , b ) to further generalize the work of syer & tremaine ( 1996 ) . with proper adaptations ,",
    "these global stationary perturbation solutions may be utilized to model large - scale structures spiral galaxies .",
    "while a scale - free disc has no characteristic scales , one may impose boundary conditions to describe a modified scale - free disc , e.g. , by cutting a central hole in a disc ( e.g. , zang 1976 ; evans & read 1998a , b ) .",
    "with such boundary conditions , discrete eigenfunctions for perturbations may be constructed as growing normal modes . on the other hand , by specifying a phase relation for a postulated reflection of spiral waves from the origin @xmath13 , goodman & evans ( 1999 ) could also define discrete normal modes even for an unmodified gaseous sid .",
    "shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) speculated that the swing amplification process ( e.g. , goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; julian & toomre 1966 ; toomre 1977 ; fan & lou 1997 ) across corotation allows a continuum of normal modes ( lynden - bell & lemos 1993 ) while proper ` boundary conditions ' may select from this continuum a discrete spectrum of unstable normal modes ; they also suggested that zero - frequency ( stationary ) disturbances do signal the onset of instability .",
    "on the basis of the work of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a single isopedically magnetized sid and of lou & shen ( 2003 ) for a composite sid system without magnetic field ,",
    "lou & wu ( 2004 ) analyzed coplanar mhd perturbation structures in a composite sid system with one of the disc being isopedically magnetized ( shu & li 1997 ) .",
    "as x - ray emitting hot gases can freely flow along open magnetic field lines anchored at the gaseous disc , global stationary solutions constructed by lou & wu ( 2004 ) set an important preliminary stage for modelling spiral galactic mhd winds .",
    "in particular , if activities of star formation , starbursts and supernovae etc .",
    "are mainly responsible for producing x - ray emitting hot gases streaming out of the galactic plane from both sides , we would expect stronger winds from the circumnuclear starburst region ( e.g. lou et al .",
    "2001 ) and along spiral arms than those winds from the remainder of the galactic disc plane .",
    "both sid and msid models offer valuable physical insight for disc dynamics and belong to a wider family of scale - free discs ( syer & tremaine 1996 ) where physical variables in the axisymmetric background equilibrium scale as powers of radius @xmath14 ( e.g. , the rotation curve @xmath15 ) .",
    "it turns out that coplanar perturbations in such scale - free discs in a proper range of @xmath8 can be treated globally and analytically ( lemos et al .",
    "1991 ; syer & tremaine 1996 ) without invoking the usual wkbj or tight - winding approximation to solve the poisson equation for density wave perturbations ( lin & shu 1964 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) . in other words , it becomes feasible to include azimuthal magnetic fields in a scale - free disc and to construct global coplanar mhd perturbation configurations that are stationary in an inertial frame of reference .",
    "such analytical solutions , still idealized and limited , are making important further steps and are extremely valuable for bench - marking numerical codes and for initializing numerical mhd simulations .    for an azimuthally magnetized scale - free disc with an infinitesimal thickness , the axisymmetric background equilibrium without radial flow is characterized by following features : a surface mass density @xmath0 , a rotation curve @xmath2 , an azimuthal magnetic field @xmath1 and a barotropic equation of state @xmath16 where @xmath5 is the vertically integrated gas pressure with constant @xmath17 for a warm disc and @xmath18 as the barotropic index . to maintain a radial force balance at all radii",

    "the prescribed range of @xmath8 turns out to be @xmath10 that includes the previous special case of @xmath19 ( i.e. , the msid case ) studied by lou ( 2002 ) , lou & zou ( 2004a ) and lou & wu ( 2004 ) . in section 2 , we introduce coplanar mhd perturbations and present the linearized perturbation equations .",
    "we construct and analyze global stationary aligned and logarithmic spiral perturbation configurations in section 3 and as an example of illustration , we discuss specifically the case of @xmath11 with the background azimuthal magnetic field being force - free . in section 4 , we derive phase relationships between perturbation enhancements of surface mass density and magnetic field for both aligned and logarithmic spiral cases , and discuss the problem of angular momentum conservation . finally , we summarize our results in section 5 . for the convenience of reference ,",
    "relevant technical details are collected in the appendices .",
    "in the magnetofluid approximation , the disc is taken to be razor - thin ( i.e. , we use vertically integrated magnetofluid equations and neglect vertical derivatives of physical variables ) and large - scale stationary aligned and spiral coplanar disturbances develop in a background mhd rotational equilibrium of axisymmetry ( syer & tremaine 1996 ; lou 2002 ; lou & zou 2004a ; lou & wu 2004 ) . the background magnetic field is taken to be azimuthal to avoid the magnetic field winding dilemma ( lou & fan 1998a ) . for the sake of simplicity at this stage , non - ideal effects such as viscosity , resistivity and thermal diffusion etc .",

    "therefore , the coplanar perturbation enhancement of magnetic field is either ahead of or lagging behind the perturbation enhancement of surface mass density by a phase difference of @xmath324 .    for intermediate radial wavelengths ,",
    "the phase difference between perturbation enhancements of surface mass density and magnetic field in a logarithmic spiral pattern can be readily determined for given specific conditions .",
    "on the basis of our model analysis here , it appears that except for global stationary fast mhd density waves in the extreme wkbj regime , magnetic and gas spiral arms tend to be phase shifted relative to each other for a global stationary logarithmic spiral pattern for a much broader set of rotation curves including the special case of a flat rotation curve .",
    "one can readily show that for aligned global stationary mhd perturbation configurations , there is no net radial angular momentum flux as aligned stationary mhd density waves do not propagate radially ( shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ) .",
    "we here briefly discuss the process of angular momentum transfer in association with the stationary logarithmic spiral mhd modes obtained in this paper . according to the analyses of lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) and fan & lou ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the total angular momentum flux carried by coplanar mhd density waves should contain three separate contributions , namely , the advective transport flux @xmath325 defined by @xmath326 the gravity torque flux @xmath327 defined by @xmath328\\bigg[\\frac{\\partial\\re(\\phi_1 ) } { \\partial r}\\bigg]\\\\ ] ] and the magnetic torque flux @xmath329 defined by @xmath330    the perturbed three - dimensional gravitational potential @xmath331 associated with a fourier component of a coplanar logarithmic spiral perturbation in surface mass density @xmath332 is then @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the cylindrical bessel function of order @xmath109 with an argument @xmath23 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "in fact , integral ( [ 3dphi1 ] ) gives a simple form of kalnajs function in the disc plane at @xmath335 with the real part of @xmath331 explicitly given by @xmath336 it is fairly straightforward to show that @xmath325 and @xmath329 are independent of @xmath14 where the phase relationships for stationary logarithmic spiral cases derived in section 4.1 have been use .",
    "while mathematically tedious , one can further show that @xmath327 is also independent of @xmath14 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "therefore , the total angular momentum flux @xmath337 remains constant at all radii , a natural result of angular momentum conservation given that perturbation surface mass density falls off as @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , in order to maintain a stationary logarithmic spiral pattern , there must be a source or a sink at the disc center .",
    "the perturbation energy flux , however , is zero at all radii for the stationary coplanar mhd configurations [ see equation ( 4.17 ) of fan & lou ( 1999 ) in the wkbj regime ] .",
    "the mass flux is also zero at all radii since the first - order mass flux @xmath338 , and the second - order mass flux @xmath339 [ where @xmath340 is the second - order perturbed radial velocity , this equation holds due to the second - order mass conservation ( fan & lou 1999 ) ] .",
    "therefore our model result differs from that of spruit ( 1987 ) for stationary logarithmic spiral shocks , where only the gravity of the central object is considered .",
    "in spruit s model , there is a net mass accretion through the disc and an effective viscosity parameter `` @xmath7 '' ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) may be estimated .",
    "physically , the central source of angular momentum required to sustain global stationary logarithmic spiral patterns may be plausibly identified with a fast spinning supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the nucleus of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the kerr spacetime associated with such a spinning smbh excites and sustains mhd density waves in the surrounding disc through a long - range gravitational interaction . for trailing spiral patterns , a net flux of angular momentum is transport radially outward in the disc .",
    "conceptually , this process should cause the spinning smbh to gradually slow down , entirely analogous to the spin - down of a rotating neutron star by emitting electromagnetic waves that carry a net angular momentum away .",
    "in this paper , we have explored and analyzed stationary perturbation structures in coplanarly magnetized razor - thin scale - free discs in a more general manner . to be specific ,",
    "we start from a rotational and magnetized background equilibrium of axisymmetry that is dynamically self - consistent with a surface mass density @xmath341 , a rotation curve @xmath2 , a purely azimuthal ( ring ) magnetic field @xmath1 with a vertically integrated barotropic equation of state in the form of @xmath16 .",

    "the second parameter is an effective rotational mach number @xmath82 defined as the ratio of the disc rotation speed to the sound speed yet with an additional scaling factor @xmath345 ; @xmath82 is constant at all radii .",
    "the third parameter @xmath77 is a measure for the background ring magnetic field strength defined as the ratio of the azimuthal alfvn speed to the sound speed ; and @xmath77 remains constant at all radii . for @xmath89 ,",
    "there is no constraint on @xmath77 and the net lorentz force of the background azimuthal magnetic field is radially outward ( the magnetic pressure force is stronger than the magnetic tension force ) to resist the self - gravitation ; for @xmath11 , the background azimuthal magnetic field is force - free ( the magnetic pressure and tension forces cancel each other exactly ) ; for @xmath88 , the net lorentz force of the background azimuthal magnetic field points radially inward ( the magnetic pressure force is weaker than the magnetic tension force ) to aggravate the self - gravity and thus a restriction [ i.e. , inequality ( [ restrt ] ) ] is imposed on the magnetic field strength in order to guarantee that the surface mass density be positive in equation ( [ propequilib ] ) .",
