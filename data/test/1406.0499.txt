    "high - mass stars are much less frequent than intermediate- or low - mass stars due to both the star formation process , which gives rise to an initial mass function declining with the mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to their shorter evolutionary times . however , high - mass stars are very important because they can affect their surroundings with their winds , their strong radiation fields , and their catastrophic death as supernovae , chemically enriching their environment and triggering star formation .",
    "they usually form within the dense cores of stellar clusters and/or associations where dynamical interactions play an important role .",
    "it is widely believed that massive stars may be the product of collisions between two or more intermediate - mass stars .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that a large fraction of massive stars harbour close companions , as failed mergers .",
    "it has been recently estimated that at least 50% of massive stars are member of binary or multiple star system @xcite .",
    "this lucky occurrence allows to directly measure the masses by means of their radial velocity ( rv ) curves . in many cases , spectral lines of both components",
    "are visible ( sb2 systems ) , allowing to derive the orbital parameters like the period , @xmath5 , the projected semi - major axes , @xmath6 , and the masses , @xmath7 , apart from the factor @xmath8 .",
    "if our line - of - sight is close to the orbital plane and fractional radii of the components are not too small the stars display mutually eclipses . the orbital inclination and fractional radii of the component stars can be determined by the analysis of photometric light curves .",
    "therefore , eclipsing binaries are unique targets for determining the masses and radii from their combined light curves and radial velocities analyses .",
    "nevertheless , absolute radii were measured only for a rather small number of early - type b - stars which are members of eclipsing binary systems @xcite .",
    "thus , we started a systematic observing program devoted to the spectroscopic study of close eclipsing binary systems with at least one hot component .",
    "the light variability of v446cephei ( hd 210478 ; bd+60@xmath92348 ; hip 109311 ; v=7@xmath10.32 , b - v=0@xmath10.08 ) has been discovered by the @xmath0 photometry @xcite .",
    "it was classified as an algol - type eclipsing binary ( ea ) from visual inspection of light variation .",
    "the orbital period of v446cep has been determined by the @xmath0 satellite as 3.8084 days and the ephemeris is given as follows , @xmath11 the @xmath0 light curve ( lc ) displays a primary minimum with a depth of about 0.14 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite designated it as v446cep and classified it as an ea according to the criteria of the general catalogue of variable stars .",
    "@xcite included the star in the list of probable members of the cepob2 association .",
    "in this paper we present new spectroscopic observations of v446cep .",
    "we evaluate effective temperatures and surface gravities of the component stars from an ad - hoc analysis of the spectra taken near the quadratures . combining the results obtained by the analysis of rv and light curves we determine directly absolute masses and radii of the components .",
    "we infer distance to the system , their fundamental parameters , and briefly discuss the main outcomes of this study .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of v446cep were obtained at the tubitak national observatory using the turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) attached to the 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the observations were made from july 22 , 2012 to august 3 , 2013 , under good seeing conditions .",
    "further details on the telescope and the spectrograph can be found at http://www.tug.tubitak.gov.tr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 4000 - 9000   in 11 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath12/@xmath13 @xmath147000 at 6500  . the average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was @xmath14120 .",
    "we also obtained high s / n spectra of early type standard stars 1cas ( b0.5iv ) , hr153 ( b2iv ) , @xmath15her ( b5iv ) , 21peg ( b9.5v ) and @xmath16lyr ( a0v ) which were used as templates in derivation of the radial velocities .",
    "the echelle spectra were extracted from the raw images following standard reduction steps involving electronic bias subtraction , flat field division , cosmic rays removal , optimal extraction of the echelle orders , and wavelength calibration thanks to the emission lines of a th - ar lamp .",
    "the reduction was performed using tasks of the iraf package",
    "our spectroscopic dataset contains 15 observations for v446cep .",
    "we have measured radial velocities ( rvs ) from the spectra , focusing on spectral segments containing the hei @xmath125876 ( order4 ) and @xmath126678 ( order3 ) lines which are the most prominent un - blended features in our spectra , apart from the balmer lines .",
    "we have employed the standard cross - correlation method for measuring the velocities of the component stars of the system .",
    "the cross - correlation technique @xcite is widely used for measuring rvs from the spectra of close binary systems .",
    "cross - correlation analyses were made using the spectra of @xmath15her and 21peg as templates .",
    "the principle spectral features showing splitting due to binarity were the hei lines at @xmath175876 and 6678 .",
    "we used also order 9 , containing the hei @xmath124471 line , for a few measurements of the radial velocities .",
    "the spectra taken close to the conjunctions , which display no double - lined feature , were disregarded .",
    "the balmer lines were not used in the measurements of radial velocities due to their extremely broad profiles .",
    "we obtained 15 radial velocities for each component of v446cep .",
    "the average radial velocities and their associated standard errors derived from the spectral segments containing hei @xmath174471 , 5876 , and 6678 lines are presented in table1 , along with the observation date and orbital phase .",
    "the mean error of radial velocities is 2.5kms@xmath18 for the primary , and 3.6 kms@xmath18 for the secondary star of v446cep .",
    "the rvs are plotted against the orbital phase in fig.1 , where the filled squares represent the primary and the empty squares the secondary stars .",
    "examination of the @xmath0 light curve show no evidence for any eccentricity in the orbit of the system .",
    "therefore , we have assumed circular orbit and analysed the rvs using the rvsim software programme @xcite .",
    "final orbital parameters are presented in table2 .",
    "intermediate - resolution optical spectroscopy permits us to derive most of the fundamental stellar parameters , such as the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath19 ) , spectral type ( s@xmath1 ) , luminosity class , effective temperature ( @xmath20 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath21 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the width of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is a good tool for the measurement of projected rotational velocity ( @xmath22 ) of a star .",
    "we use a method developed by @xcite to estimate the @xmath22 of each star composing the investigated sb2 system from its ccf peak by a proper calibration based on a spectrum of a narrow - lined star with a similar spectral type .",
    "the rotational velocities of the components were obtained by measuring the fwhm of the ccf peak related to each component in five high - s / n spectra acquired near the quadratures , where the spectral lines have the largest doppler - shift .",
    "the ccfs were used for the determination of @xmath19 through a calibration of the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ccf peak as a function of the @xmath19 of artificially broadened spectra of slowly rotating standard star ( 21peg , @xmath2314 kms@xmath18 , e.g. , @xcite ) acquired with the same setup and in the same observing night as the target system .",
    "the limb darkening coefficient was fixed at the theoretically predicted values , 0.42 for the system @xcite .",
    "we calibrated the relationship between the ccf gaussian width and @xmath19 using the @xcite data sample .",
    "this analysis yielded projected rotational velocities for the components of v446cep as @xmath24=120  kms@xmath18 , and @xmath25  kms@xmath18 .",
    "the mean deviations were 3 and 9 kms@xmath18 , for the primary and secondary , respectively , between the measured velocities for different lines .",
    "we also performed a spectral classification for the components of the system using compo2 , an idl code for the analysis of high - resolution spectra of sb2 systems written by one of us ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and adapted to the tfosc spectra .",
    "this code searches for the best combination of two reference spectra able to reproduce the observed spectrum of the system .",
    "we give , as input parameters , the radial velocities and projected rotational velocities @xmath22 of the two components of the system , which were already derived .",
    "the code then finds , for the selected spectral region , the spectral types and fractional flux contributions that better reproduce the observed spectrum , i.e. which minimize the residuals in the collection of difference ( observed@xmath26composite ) spectra . for this task we used reference spectra taken from the @xcite @xmath27 ( with a a resolution of @xmath281 ) that are representative of stars with spectral types from late - o type to early - a , and luminosity classes v , iv , and iii .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of these reference stars were recently revised by @xcite .",
    "we selected 198 reference spectra spanning the ranges of expected atmospheric parameters , which means that we have searched for the best combination of spectra among 39204 possibilities per each spectrum .",
    "the observed spectra of v446cep in the @xmath1765256720 spectral region were best represented by the combination of hd187459 ( b0.5 ii ) and hd178125 ( b8 iii ) .",
    "however , we have adopted , for each component , the spectral type and luminosity class with the highest score in the collection of the best combinations of templates , where the score takes into account the goodness of the fit expressed by the minimum of the residuals .",
    "we have thus derived a spectral types for the primary and secondary component of v446cep as b1 and b9 main - sequence stars , with an uncertainty of about 1 spectral subclass .",
    "the effective temperature and surface gravity of the two components of the system are obtained as the weighted average of the values of the best spectra at phases near to the quadratures combinations of templates adopting a weight @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the average of residuals for the @xmath31-th combination .",
    "the standard error of the weighted mean was adopted for the atmospheric parameters .",
    "both stars appear to have a solar metallicity , within the errors .",
    "the atmospheric parameters obtained by the code and their standard errors are reported in table3 .",
    "the observed spectra of v446cep at phases near to the quadratures are shown in fig.2 together with the combination of two reference spectra which gives the best match .",
    "the light curve of v446cep was obtained by the @xmath0 spacecraft and is composed of 124 photometric points .",
    "the light curve is very similar to that of a detached algol - type binary .",
    "the brightness of the system at the maximum and depth of the primary minimum were estimated by @xcite to be 7.31 and 0.14 mag , respectively .",
    "however , we estimate the brightness of the system at the maximum light as hp=7.348 mag , with a mean error of about 0.013 mag , and the depth the primary minimum as 0.10 mag .",
    "the hp magnitudes were transformed to the johnson s v - passband using the coefficients given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 light curve is plotted against the orbital phase in fig.3 .",
    "there is no indications of any asymmetry in the lc .",
    "as the secondary minimum occurs at phase 0.5 , we have adopted circular orbits for our analysis .",
    "the effective temperatures for the primary and secondary star were estimated from the spectra as 26580@xmath2880 and 12000@xmath21050 k , respectively .",
    "the apparent visual magnitude and colour indices were given by @xcite as @xmath32=7@xmath33.32 , ( @xmath34)=@xmath260@xmath33.71 , and ( @xmath35)=0@xmath33.08 .",
    "we obtained the reddening - free quantity @xmath36=@xmath260.768 , which corresponds to a b1 main - sequence star @xcite with an intrinsic colour of ( @xmath35)=@xmath260@xmath33.273 . this colour index corresponds to an effective temperature of 26800@xmath2800 k @xcite , which is consistent with that obtained directly from the spectra .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the light curve gives a light ratio of @xmath37/@xmath38=0.014 .",
    "using the intrinsic colour of the primary star , the light ratio and the observed composite colour of the system an interstellar reddening of @xmath39=0@xmath33.338 was determined for the system .",
    "we started to analyze the light curve using the wilson - devinney code ( hereafter wd ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as implemented in the software phoebe @xcite .",
    "the wd code is widely used for determination of the orbital parameters of the eclipsing binaries . to run the code",
    "we need some initial parameters .",
    "the initial logarithmic limb - darkening coefficients were taken from the tables given by @xcite as @xmath40=0.41 and @xmath41=0.62 , @xmath42=0.24 @xmath42=0.30 and are automatically interpolated at each iteration by phoebe . the effective temperature of the primary star is taken as 26600 k and the ratio of the masses of two components @xmath43=0.147 .",
    "we have started with @xmath44 meant for detached binary systems , keeping the temperature of the primary and the mass - ratio as fixed parameters . according to the wd code we adjusted the following parameters : @xmath31 ( the orbital inclination ) , @xmath45 ( the potential for the primary ) , @xmath46 ( the potential for the secondary ) , @xmath47 ( the effective temperature of the cool star ) , l@xmath48 ( the luminosity of the primary ) , and the zero - epoch offset .",
    "the luminosity of the secondary star , l@xmath49 , was constrained by the model .",
    "after a few numbers of runs of the dc program in @xmath44 the sum of residuals squared showed a minimum and the corrections to the adjustable parameters became smaller than their probable errors .",
    "the results are given in the table4 .",
    "the corresponding computed light curve is shown in fig.3 as a continuous line .",
    "based on the results of radial velocities and light curves analyses we have calculated the physical properties of the v446cep . for this purpose , we used the @xmath50 code developed by @xcite .",
    "this code is now widely used for derivation of the absolute parameters of the eclipsing binary stars components .",
    "it calculates complete error budgets using a perturbation algorithm .",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters for the components such as masses , radii , luminosities and their standard deviations have been derived using this code .",
    "the astrophysical parameters of the components , and other properties for the stars of v446cep is presented in table5 .",
    "the separation between the components was found to be 28.10@xmath20.63 r@xmath3 for v446cep .",
    "the masses were measured to precision of about 67% , apart from the mass of the secondary star of v446cep , which has an uncertainty of about 11% . on the other hand the radii of the stars",
    "have been derived with a precision of better than 5% .",
    "the accuracy of any parameter of an eclipsing binary system depends mainly on the coverage of the both spectroscopic and photometric observations and their precision .",
    "in addition , the lc solutions are more accurate for totally eclipsing systems .",
    "the light curve of v446cep shows total eclipses , but the precision of the photometric measurements is not sufficiently high . despite these drawbacks",
    ", the physical parameters of the components of system could be determined with sufficient precision .",
    "we note that the effective temperature of the secondary star derived from the spectra is in good agreement with that obtained from the light curve analysis .",
    "the luminosities and absolute bolometric magnitudes are calculated directly from the radii and and effective temperatures of the components . the effective temperature of 5777  k and the absolute bolometric magnitude of 4.74 mag were adopted for the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bolometric corrections were interpolated from the tables of @xcite .",
    "the v - band magnitude of the system at out - of - eclipse phases is taken as 7.32 for v446cep .",
    "we have calculated the absolute visual magnitudes for the components using the fractional luminosities and bolometric corrections given in table4 and 5 .",
    "combining these values with the interstellar absorption of 1.09mag for v446cep we have estimated the distance to the system as 1100@xmath262pc .    in the log @xmath20@xmath51 ( left panel ) and log @xmath20-logg planes ( right panel ) of fig.4 we have plotted the positions of the components , with 1-@xmath52 error bars .",
    "the filled and empty circles represent the primary and secondary star of v446cep .",
    "the evolutionary tracks and isochrones for the non - rotating single stars with solar composition are taken from @xcite .",
    "v446cep was included in the list of probable members of the cepob2 association ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "according to @xcite the distance to the cepheus ob2 association is @xmath14900pc and it is embedded in the cepheus bubble , a giant shell structure of atomic and molecular gas extending in a radius of about 120pc , which is believed to be generated by an earlier generation of hot and massive stars in ngc7160 .",
    "@xcite derived a reddening in the range 0.291.12 for the stars in the cepob2 field , with a mean value of 0.59 for the members of the association .",
    "the interstellar reddening that we estimated for v446cep , @xmath39=0.34 , is lower than the value estimated for the association , but it is consistent with the value of 0.32 derived by @xcite for the binary system lzcep in this association .",
    "this result suggests that the binary is located near the ngc7160 in the border of cepheus bubble @xcite .",
    "the open clusters tr37 and ngc7160 with the ages of 4 and 12 myr locate in the association @xcite .",
    "our distance of v446cep agrees quite well with those distance values of cepob2 association .",
    "both components of v446cep appear to have an age of about 10 myr which is consistent with the age of stars in the open cluster ngc7160 .",
    "as seen from fig.4 , components of the system are located on the main - sequence , i.e. in the central hydrogen burning phase .",
    "they are still inside their lobes , corresponding to the detached algols .",
    "@xcite collected the physical parameters of 74 detached algols , mainly composed of hot ( baf - type ) stars .",
    "their mass - ratios , m@xmath53/m@xmath54 , are generally larger than 0.5 , with a mean value of 0.88 .",
    "the binary system arcas has the smallest mass - ratio in their table1 , with a value of 0.315 .",
    "we find v446cep as a detached algol with a lower mass - ratio .",
    "@xmath55 , which is among lowest values found for this class of binaries .",
    "the less massive stars in the semi - detached binaries fill their corresponding roche lobes and are oversized and over - luminous relative to a zero - age main - sequence star of the same mass @xcite .",
    "although the less - massive secondary star of v446cep does not fill its respective roche volume it is seen as oversized and over - luminous with respect to its mass , similar to the secondaries of the semi - detached systems .",
    "v446cep is close eclipsing binary containing high - mass star .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations of the system .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of the stars in the eclipsing pair have been determined from its spectra .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using cross - correlation for measuring the radial velocities of both components and with an ad - hoc code for deriving their atmospheric parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 light curve was modeled using the wd code .",
    "the physical parameters for the system are measured to accuracies of 6 - 7% in mass , apart from the secondary of v446cep , and 5% in radius . the distance to the system v446cep",
    "was estimated as 1100@xmath262pc .",
    "a comparison of physical parameters of the components with the theoretical models of single stellar evolution models has been made and an age of about 10myr for v446cep has been derived .",
    "both the estimated age and distance of v446cep confirm its membership of cepheus ob2 association , locating close to the open cluster ngc7160 .",
