    "zero - temperature quantum phase transitions  @xcite arise in many - body systems with competing ground states controlled by nonthermal model parameters .",
    "they are of first order when the infinite - volume ground - state properties are discontinuous across the transition point .",
    "first - order quantum transitions ( foqts ) are of great interest , as they occur in a large number of quantum many - body systems , such as quantum hall samples  @xcite , itinerant ferromagnets  @xcite , heavy fermion metals  @xcite , etc .",
    "although foqts do not develop a diverging correlation length in the infinite - volume limit , they show finite - size scaling ( fss ) behaviors around the transition point , which turn out to be particularly sensitive to the boundary conditions  @xcite . indeed , unlike fss at continuous transitions ,",
    "the size dependence of the foqt scaling variables may significantly change when varying the boundary conditions .",
    "for example , in the case of the foqts of ising chains , driven by a magnetic field in their quantum ferromagnetic phase , we have an exponential size dependence for open and periodic boundary conditions , while it is power law for antiperiodic or kink - like boundary conditions .",
    "actually , this particular sensitiveness to the boundary conditions may be considered as a peculiar feature of foqts , which qualitatively distinguishes their fss behaviors from those at continuous quantum transitions  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of these finite - size properties is important for a correct interpretation of experimental or numerical data when quantum phase transitions are investigated in relatively small systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we put forward general ansatzes for the fss at a foqt driven by a generic parameter @xmath2 . around the foqt point @xmath3 , the relevant _ scaling _ variable @xmath4 is expected to be the ratio between the energy contribution @xmath5 of the perturbation driving the transition [ generally @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an appropriate exponent ] and the energy difference ( _ gap _ ) of the lowest states @xmath8 at @xmath9 . then , around @xmath3 , the gap satisfies the fss ansatz @xmath10 where @xmath11 , thus @xmath12 .",
    "analogous scaling behaviors apply to other quantities . for example",
    ", the magnetization is expected to asymptotically behave as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a normalization which we identify with the magnetization obtained approaching the transition point @xmath15 from the ordered phase , after the infinite - volume limit .",
    "the above fss ansatzes represent the simplest scaling behaviors compatible with the foqt discontinuities arising in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "the ansatzes can also be extended to allow for the temperature  @xcite .",
    "the particular sensitiveness to the boundary conditions essentially arises from the energy gap at @xmath3 entering the scaling variable @xmath4 , whose finite - size behavior depends crucially on the boundary conditions considered .",
    "hence , once the scaling variables are expressed in terms of the parameter driving the transition and the size @xmath16 , the @xmath16 dependence of the fss may significantly change according to the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the above scaling ansatzes have been checked , and confirmed , at the foqt of ising chains in the ferromagnetic phase , driven by the ( odd ) magnetic field coupled to the order - parameter spin operator .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we further develop this issue , extending the fss analysis to foqts driven by ( even ) temperature - like parameters , with a discontinuity in the infinite - volume energy density of the ground state .",
    "for this purpose we consider the quantum @xmath0-state potts chains  @xcite , which undergo foqts for a sufficiently large number of states , i.e. @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "they provide a theoretical laboratory to test the scaling arguments at foqts in a controlled framework , due to the relative simplicity of the model for which the transition point is exactly known .",
    "we observe fss described by the general ansatzes ( [ deltah ] ) and ( [ m0h ] ) .",
    "moreover , like foqts of the ising chains  @xcite , its asymptotic size dependence turns out to be particularly sensitive to the choice of the boundary conditions , giving rise to size dependences with different power laws .",

    "we also discuss the fss behavior at the foqts driven by parallel magnetic fields in the ordered ferromagnetic phase , for any @xmath0 , thus also for the ising chain .",
    "we argue that the fss behavior can be obtained by extending the two - level approximation used in the case of ising chains  @xcite , to a @xmath0-level approximation . like the analogous foqts of ising chains",
    ", we confirm the existence of fss , with a scaling variable which depends exponentially on the size of the chain .",
    "we stress that the fss behavior at foqts is observed for relatively small sizes .",
    "indeed , chains of size up to a few tens turn out to be sufficient to show the asymptotic fss behavior . thus",
    ", even small systems may show definite signatures of foqts , as also argued in refs .",
    "this makes fss at foqts particularly interesting , because it may require only modest - size systems to be observed .",
    "for this reason , the present results may be relevant for quantum simulators , where controllable quantum systems , usually of modest size , are engineered to reproduce particular hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in quantum computing , some algorithms , notably the adiabatic ones , rely on a sufficiently large gap  @xcite , and thus fail at foqts . the scaling theory that we present may help to understand how this occurs in finite systems .",
    "we finally mention that an interesting extension of this study concerns the effects of inhomogeneous conditions at foqts , such as those induced by space dependent external fields .",
    "nontrivial scaling phenomena emerge also in this case , with respect to the length scale of the induced inhomogeneity , in the space transition region between the two phases  @xcite .",
    "we first consider the finite - chain potts model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath162 notice that the difference with the hamiltonian ( [ qpotts ] ) is just relegated to the second sum which does not contain the lattice size @xmath163 . in this case",
    "one can define an exact duality transformation , which maintains the form of the hamiltonian ( [ qpottssd ] ) , interchanging the role of the two sums , thus @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this is achieved by defining the new operators @xmath166 and @xmath167 ,  @xcite formally located between two adjacent sites , such that @xmath168 which satisfy the same algebra of the original operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the inverse dual transformation reads @xmath169 note that , in order to get an hamiltonian formally identical to @xmath170 , one should also perform a space inversion @xmath171 .",
    "this duality properties imply that a unitary transformation @xmath172 exists such that @xmath173 which also implies the spectrum relation ( [ spduality ] ) for @xmath78 .    since @xmath174=0 $ ] , the spectrum of @xmath170 is degenerate , with a degeneracy associated with the @xmath0 eigenstates of @xmath175 .",
    "this implies that the hilbert space can be decomposed into @xmath0 subspaces @xmath176 , such that @xmath177 , cf .",
    "( [ omega ] ) .",
    "if we restrict @xmath178 to @xmath179 , we obtain the model described by the hamiltonian ( [ qpotts ] ) supplemented with the boundary term ( [ hb ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath59 , for a chain of length @xmath180 .",
    "this is already sufficient to show that the finite potts chain with sdbc is self dual , thus its spectrum satisfies the duality relation ( [ spduality ] ) .",
    "of course , this could have been demonstrated by directly using the duality transformations ( beside those given in eq .",

    "the computation involves solving eigenproblems of a size that rapidly grows with @xmath0 as @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the number of states used in the dmrg base .",
    "we used up to @xmath190 for our dmrg computation of the @xmath17 potts chains . in the worst case ,",
    "corresponding to the longest chains , the truncation error ( i.e. , the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ) is @xmath191 .",
    "the energies @xmath192 of the excited states ( and the differences @xmath193 as a consequence ) are the quantities affected by larger convergence errors , whereas ground state properties , such as the ground state energy , the energy densities and the magnetizations , converge much more rapidly .",
    "the systematic error on a dmrg measurement can be estimated by looking at the progression of its convergence with successive iterations of the algorithm and as @xmath189 is gradually increased .",
    "we benchmarked this heuristics by comparing dmrg measurements with exact values on small chains , obtained with a diagonalization code .",
    "to give an idea of the computational effort and accuracy of our numerical work , we mention that the dmrg computation for @xmath194 chain with sdbc at @xmath79 required a few hundred hours of cpu time of a standard processor to reach the truncation error of @xmath195 for @xmath190 .",
    "this allowed us to obtain the estimates @xmath196 ( where the number in parenthesis quantifies the systematic error due to the truncation of the states , corresponding to a relative precision of @xmath197 for @xmath155 ) , @xmath198 , @xmath199 for the lowest energy levels , thus @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , @xmath203 for the magnetization and energy density at the center of the chain .",

    "we stress that the calculation of the energy differences , i.e. the gap , is essential to check the fss ansatzes , thus we could not restrict our computations to the ground - state expectation values , which are usually much more precise .    since the precision turns out to rapidly degrade with increasing @xmath16 , making the computations very demanding to reach a satisfactory accuracy , we restricted our @xmath17 study to chain up @xmath194 sites . fortunately , these relatively small sizes turn out to be already sufficient to provide a clear evidence of fss at the foqts",
    ".    the low energy spectrum of the potts chain with obc is characterised by highly degenerate multiplets  @xcite ( see also fig .",

    "the dmrg algorithm makes extensive use of sparse eigensolvers , whose rate of convergence and numerical stability depend on the spacing between the different eigenvalues .",
    "the system with sdbc is not affected by this issue thanks to the fixed spin at one end of the chain , which lifts the degeneracy .",
    "to give an idea of this effect , we performed a test run on a potts chain with @xmath208 and @xmath209 with both sdbc and obc , completing two sweeps with @xmath210 basis states and keeping all other simulation parameters unchanged . for @xmath160 and @xmath82 ,",
    "the obc system is expected to exhibit a @xmath0-times degenerate ground state .",
