    "microscopic classical black hole ( bh ) production in transplanckian particle collisions is one of the most exciting possible experimental signatures of large extra dimensions scenarios of tev - scale gravity ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , thorough theoretical understanding of this process is still lacking .",
    "classical general relativity intuition tells us that gravitational collapse should occur if the center - of - mass energy of the colliding particles is deposited within a region of size about the schwarzschild radius corresponding to this energy @xcite . but",
    "is this intuition applicable in the quantum world of elementary particles ? in this letter",
    "i will present arguments suggesting that classical gravity description of microscopic bh production may be inadequate .",
    "the starting point of my discussion is the classical gravity analysis of @xcite , which makes more precise the intuitive picture described above .",
    "these authors considered classical gravitational field of two fast point particles in a grazing collision .",
    "they found that for impact parameters of the order of the corresponding schwarzschild radius , the collision spacetime contains a closed trapped surface ( cts ) . from this fact ,",
    "bh formation follows by the singularity theorems of classical general relativity and the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "my goal is to subject this analysis to validity checks , which have to be passed by any classical field theory computation .",
    "the well - known necessary conditions which have to be satisfied are : 1 ) field strengths have to be small ; 2 ) the number of field quanta has to be large .",
    "the meaning of `` small '' and `` large '' in the preceding paragraph depends on the situation and has to be decided on a case - by - case basis .",
    "familiar examples are provided by electromagnetism . the first condition is violated when the electric field reaches the critical value @xmath0 .",
    "the classical solution will be destroyed by copious electron - positron pair production .",
    "the second condition is violated by a classical electromagnetic pulse whose energy @xmath1 is small compared to the characteristic frequency @xmath2 . in quantum theory , such a pulse will correspond to a state with a small mean number of photons .",
    "thus quantum fluctuations are large , and classical field theory description is inadequate .    in the gravitational case ,",
    "the first condition takes form of the requirement that curvature should be @xmath3 ( in planck units ) .",
    "as i have shown in @xcite , this condition is violated in the collision spacetime of @xcite in a region relevant for the horizon formation ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to carry out the second check , by estimating the number of gravitons participating in the collision ( section 3 ) .",
    "let us focus on the add large extra dimension scenario @xcite with fundamental @xmath4-dimensional energy scale of gravity @xmath5 tev .",
    "the compactification radius @xmath6 is fixed so that at large distances we recover the usual effective scale @xmath7 gev . to avoid contradiction with the existing short - distance gravity measurements @xcite",
    ", we have to assume @xmath8 .",
    "the standard model fields are localized on a 4-dimensional brane embedded in the @xmath4-dimensional bulk .",
    "if such or a similar scenario is realized in nature , next - generation accelerators will be able to probe the transplanckian regime of quantum gravity , colliding particles with energy @xmath9 .",
    "( here and below the @xmath4-dimensional planck units are used with @xmath10 . )",
    "it is in such collisions that we may hope to produce microscopic @xmath4-dimensional bhs which have mass @xmath11 and are thus essentially classical . for",
    "@xmath12 quantum gravity effects would be significant without doubt .",
    "the bh production process may always be considered as happening in flat @xmath4-dimensional spacetime , because the schwarzschild radius of the created bh is much smaller than the compactification radius : @xmath13    in @xcite bh production was described by considering two fast ( @xmath14 ) , point - like particles in a grazing collision with an impact parameter @xmath15 .",
    "gravitational field of one such particle in the limit @xmath16 has curvature concentrated on the plane transverse to the direction of motion . introducing longitudinal coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 transverse coordinates @xmath20 , the only nonzero components of the riemann tensor for the right - moving particle are @xcite @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the volume of the unit @xmath24-sphere . )",
    "this is the @xmath4-dimensional generalization of the 4-dimensional aichelburg - sexl shock wave spacetime @xcite .",
    "this field should be superposed with the similar field of the left - moving particle , shifted by @xmath15 in the transverse direction .",
    "the resulting field is valid outside the region @xmath25 , where the colliding shocks start influencing each other .",
    "the metric in this region should be found by solving einstein s equation and remains unknown even in the simplest @xmath26 case .",
    "thus , bh formation may be concluded only indirectly , using the cts argument .",
    "the cts s found in @xcite are located in the known part of the spacetime .",
    "they lie in the union of pre - collision parts of the shock planes @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in shape",
    "they look roughly like a union of two throats narrowing around the particle worldlines in the far past and glued together at an angle at the transverse collision plane @xmath29 at radii @xmath30 .",
    "the validity of this classical einstein gravity argument was questioned by the present author in @xcite on the grounds that curvature becomes large on the transverse collision plane at @xmath30 , i.e. in a region relevant for bh horizon formation .",
    "coordinate - invariant measure of curvature is provided by the curvature invariant @xmath31 .",
    "notice that for a single shock wave ( [ riemann ] ) this invariant vanishes , although individual curvature components are large .",
    "this is not surprising , since the aichelburg - sexl shock wave is a boost of a manifestly low - curvature static schwarzschild solution .",
    "however , when we add a second particle , its left - moving shock wave will have large @xmath32 components . as a result",
    ", nonzero contractions can be formed , and we get @xmath33    to complete the curvature estimate , nonzero shockwave width @xmath34 has to be taken into account .",
    "this width arises from the fact that point particles are an idealization : in reality relativistic quantum particles can not be localized better then their wavelength @xmath35 . as a result , the delta functions in ( [ rsq ] ) have to be smeared out on a scale @xmath36 .",
    "this gives the final estimate @xcite of curvature at @xmath30 : @xmath37 this result means that higher curvature corrections to the einstein gravity may become important in the collision front and significantly modify or even preclude bh formation @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field of colliding particles was treated in the previous section as classical .",
    "was this justified ?    to answer this question , we first of all have to decide about a criterion when a quantum field can be considered classically .",
    "such a criterion is well known for the free electromagnetic field , and in its strongest form it says that relevant photon occupation numbers should be large @xcite .",
    "the weak form of the criterion is to require that the _ total _ number of photons with relevant frequencies be large .",
    "this condition guarantees that the zero - point energy of quantum fluctuations is small compared to the classical energy of the field .",
    "i would like to apply an analogous criterion to gravitational field .",
    "this should be possible for linearized gravity , when deviation from the minkowski metric is small : @xmath38 in this case @xmath39 can be quantized as a free field , with quanta being transverse gravitons .",
    "thus , i would like to count gravitons contained in the gravitational field of colliding particles , say , of the right - moving one .",
    "the presence of the other particle does not play a role in this counting before the shock waves collide .",
    "the standard shock wave metric @xcite @xmath40 corresponding to the riemann tensor ( [ riemann ] ) , has blowing up components and does not satisfy ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "we will instead use the metric @xmath41 ^ 2dr^2 -\\left[1-\\frac{e}{\\omega\\ , r^{d-2}}\\ , u\\theta(u)\\right]^2r^2\\,d\\omega^2 \\label{m2},\\ ] ] following from ( [ m1 ] ) by a coordinate transformation @xcite . near the shock front , this metric can be approximated as @xmath42.\\ ] ] we see that ( [ linear ] ) is satisfied in the region of interest @xmath30 and at @xmath43 .",
    "since we want to count quanta , it is convenient to quantize the graviton field @xmath39 is one of the physical gauges .",
    "we will use the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge , specified by conditions @xcite @xmath44 we can also take advantage of the fact that the shock profile is slowly varying compared to the shock width ( [ width ] ) .",
    "we can thus work in plane wave approximation @xcite , neglecting transverse derivatives of the metric : @xmath45    our goal is to estimate the number of gravitons contained in the shock front at @xmath30 , since this is the region relevant for horizon formation .",
    "the @xmath46 corresponding to ( [ lin ] ) can be written as @xmath47 in the plane wave approximation the difference between polar and cartesian coordinates disappears .",
    "we can also neglect the transverse dependence of @xmath48 , so that it becomes a constant @xmath49 .",
    "after these simplifications , ( [ pwa ] ) becomes precisely of the form ( [ tt ] ) , ( [ nonzero ] ) .",
    "linearized gravity equations of motion satisfied by ( [ nonzero ] ) are just @xmath50 quantization is performed by expanding into plane waves @xmath51 where the sum is over @xmath52 independent symmetric traceless graviton polarization tensors normalized by @xmath53 the coefficient @xmath54 has to be fixed so that the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the standard commutation relations @xmath55=2\\pi\\ , { \\delta}_{\\alpha\\alpha'}\\,{\\delta}(k - k').\\ ] ] this field normalization can be performed starting from the linearized einstein - hilbert action in the tt gauge : @xmath56 in the plane wave approximation this becomes @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the transverse area of the considered planar field configuration , @xmath59 in our case .",
    "we see that @xmath60 has the standard normalization of a 2-dimensional massless scalar field .",
    "thus we must take @xmath61 for consistency .",
    "now we are ready to count gravitons .",
    "first we expand @xmath62 in plane waves : @xmath63 the coherent state @xmath64 corresponding to a classical solution @xmath46 is characterized by the equation @xmath65 from ( [ ft ] ) and ( [ quant ] ) we see that for our classical solution ( [ pwa ] ) @xmath66 ( at @xmath67 ; the left - moving modes are of course in the vacuum state ) .",
    "the mean occupation number of such quantum oscillator state is @xmath68 finally , the total number of quanta with energy @xmath69 is @xmath70 this formula is only valid for @xmath71 [ see ( [ width ] ) ] beyond which point the graviton spectrum sharply cuts off .",
    "condition @xmath72 gives the frequency range in which graviton modes are classical : @xmath73 for modes with @xmath74 occupation numbers are small and quantum fluctuations become significant .",
    "this means that classical gravity description is adequate only at distances @xmath75 from the shock front .",
    "it is easy to see that this range is strictly smaller than the range @xmath76 [ see ( [ width ] ) ] necessary to resolve the full structure of the classical gravitational field .",
    "in particular , @xmath77",
    "as we have seen , the gravitational fields involved in the problem of bh production in particle collisions are of rather peculiar nature . on the one hand , in the collision front curvature",
    "becomes large , so that we expect transplanckian phenomena to take place there ( section 2 ) . on the other hand , precisely on the shock front",
    "we find that gravitational field can not even be considered classical , in the sense that quantum fluctuations are large , already for one shock ( section 3 ) .",
    "these elementary considerations strongly suggest that classical einstein gravity can not be used to describe bh production processes in tev - scale gravity .",
    "in particular , one can not put too much trust in the `` geometric cross section '' estimate for microscopic black hole production @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the maximal impact parameter for which a black hole would be formed classically .",
    "the applicability of classical gravity , against which i argued , is at the very foundation of this estimate .",
    "it is instructive to compare this dramatic situation with what happens in fast collisions of macroscopic ( say , solar mass ) black holes in @xmath80 . in this case",
    "the shock wave width @xmath81 is a purely classical finite-@xmath82 effect @xcite",
    ". quantum wavelength contribution , which was dominant in the microscopic case , is now absolutely negligible .",
    "the curvature in the collision front at @xmath30 will be @xmath83 for any reasonably imaginable value of @xmath82 .",
    "the number of gravitons with characteristic frequency @xmath84 is @xmath85 these estimates should be contrasted with ( [ rsq1 ] ) and ( [ comp ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , both conditions for applicability of classical general relativity are satisfied by a huge margin , and the problems discussed in this letter do not arise here .    in conclusion",
    ", i would like to mention some of the recent literature on the validity of the geometric cross section ( see @xcite for a more complete list ) .",
    "that curvature may become large in the collision front was previously suggested in @xcite , although without precise estimates . in @xcite",
    "it was stated without proof that the gravitational fields in question contain many gravitons , which as we saw in section [ count ] is not true at least in some part of the relevant frequency range .",
    "the fact that the number of gravitons in the shock front is small suggests that a perturbative treatment similar to @xcite may be attempted in order to estimate the resulting suppression of the geometric cross section . to avoid possible confusion",
    ", it also has to be noted that my considerations have nothing in common with voloshin s exponential suppression @xcite or arguments based on the  generalized uncertainty principle \" @xcite .",
