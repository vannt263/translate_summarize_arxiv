    "the phenomena of the atmosphere and ocean are extremely rich in its organization and complexity , and a lot of them can not be produced by experiments .",
    "these phenomena involve a broad range of temporal and spatial scales . as we know , both the atmospheric and oceanic flows are flows under the rotation of the earth .",
    "in fact , fast rotation and small aspect ratio are two main characteristics of the large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows .",
    "the small aspect ratio characteristic leads to the primitive equations , and the fast rotation leads to the quasi - geostrophic equations .",
    "these are fundamental equations in the study of atmospheric and oceanic flows ; see ghil and childress @xcite , lions , temam and wang @xcite , and pedlosky @xcite .",
    "furthermore , convection occurs in many regimes of the atmospheric and oceanic flows .",
    "a key problem in the study of climate dynamics and in geophysical fluid dynamics is to understand and predict the periodic , quasi - periodic , aperiodic , and fully turbulent characteristics of large - scale atmospheric and oceanic flows .",
    "stability / bifurcation theory enables one to determine how different flow regimes appear and disappear as control parameters , such as the reynolds number , vary .",
    "it , therefore , provides one with a powerful tool to explore the theoretical capability in the predictability problem .",
    "most studies so far have only considered systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that are obtained by projecting the pdes onto a finite - dimensional solution space , either by finite differencing or by truncating a fourier expansion ( see ghil and childress @xcite and further references there ) .",
    "these were pioneered by lorenz @xcite , stommel @xcite , and veronis @xcite among others , who explored the bifurcation structure of low - order models of atmospheric and oceanic flows .",
    "more recently , pseudo - arclength continuation methods have been applied to atmospheric ( legras and ghil @xcite ) and oceanic ( speich et al .",
    "@xcite and dijkstra @xcite ) models with increasing horizontal resolution .",
    "these numerical bifurcation studies have produced so far fairly reliable results for two classes of geophysical flows : ( i ) atmospheric flows in a periodic mid - latitude channel , in the presence of bottom topography and a forcing jet ; and ( ii ) oceanic flows in a rectangular mid - latitude basin , subject to wind stress on its upper surface ; see among others charney and devore @xcite , pedlosky @xcite , legras and ghil @xcite and jin and ghil @xcite for saddle - node and hopf bifurcations in the the atmospheric channel , and @xcite for saddle - node , pitchfork or hopf in the oceanic basin .",
    "the main objective of this article is to conduct bifurcation and stability analysis for the original partial differential equations ( pdes ) that govern geophysical flows .",
    "this approach should allow us to overcome some of the inherent limitations of the numerical bifurcation results that dominate the climate dynamics literature up to this point , and to capture the essential dynamics of the governing pde systems .",
    "the present article addresses the stability and transitions of basic flows for the stratified rotating boussinesq equations .",
    "these equations are fundamental equations in the geophysical fluid dynamics ; see among others pedlosky @xcite .",
    "we obtain two main results in this article .",
    "the first is to conduct a rigorous and complete bifurcation and stability analysis near the first eigenvalue of the linearized problem .",
    "the second is the onset of the hopf bifurcation , leading to the existence of periodic solutions of the model .",
    "the detailed analysis is carried out in two steps .",
    "the first is a detailed study of the eigenvalue problem for the linearized problem around the basic state . in comparison to the classical bnard convection problem",
    ", the linearized problem here is non - selfadjoint , leading to much more complicated spectrum , and more complicated dynamics .",
    "we derive in particular two critical rayleigh numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath0 is the first critical rayleigh number for the case where the prandtl number is greater than one , and @xmath1 is the first critical rayleigh number for the case where the prandtl number is less than one .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 leads to the onset of the steady state bifurcation while @xmath1 leads to the onset of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "both parameters are explicitly given in terms of the physical parameters .",
    "the crucial issues here include 1 ) a complete understanding of the spectrum , 2 ) identification of the critical rayleigh numbers , and most importantly 3 ) the verification of the principle of exchange of stabilities near these critical rayleigh numbers .",
    "the second step is to conduct a rigorous nonlinear analysis to derive the bifurcations at both the critical rayleigh numbers based on the classical hopf bifurcation theory and a newly developed dynamic bifurcation theory by two of the authors .",
    "this new dynamic bifurcation theory is centered at a new notion of bifurcation , called attractor bifurcation for dynamical systems , both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional , together with new strategies for the lyapunov - schmidt reduction and the center manifold reduction procedures .",
    "the bifurcation theory has been applied to various problems from science and engineering , including , in particular , the kuramoto - sivashinshy equation , the cahn - hillard equation , the ginzburg - landau equation , reaction - diffusion equations in biology and chemistry , and the bnard convection problem , the taylor problem ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we remark that the non - selfadjointness of the linearized problem gives rises the onset of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "we prove that the hopf bifurcation appears at the rayleigh number @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the understanding and prediction of of the the periodic , quasi - periodic , aperiodic , and fully turbulent characteristics of large - scale atmospheric and oceanic flows are key issues in the study of climate dynamics and in geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "it is hoped that the study carried out in this article will provide some insights in these important issues .    also , we would like to mention that rigorous proof of the existence of periodic solutions for a fluid system is a normally a very difficult task from the mathematical point of view .",
    "for instance , with a highly involved analysis , chen et al .",
    "@xcite proved the existence of a hopf bifurcation in an idealized fourier space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives the basic setting of the problem .",
    "section 3 states the main results .",
    "the proofs of the main results occupies the remaining part of the paper : section 4 recapitulates the essentials of the attractor bifurcation theory , section 5 is on the eigenanalysis , and section 6 is on the central manifold reduction and the completion of the proofs .",
    "the stratified rotating boussinesq equations are basic equations in the geophysical fluid dynamics , and their non - dimensional form is given by [ b1 ] \\ {    & =( u - p ) + r t e - e u-(u ) u , + & = t + w-(u ) t , + & u = 0 ,    . for @xmath2 in the non - dimensional domain @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the velocity fields , @xmath5 is the unit vector in the @xmath6-direction , @xmath7 is the prandtl number , @xmath8 is the thermal rayleigh number , @xmath9 is the rossby number , @xmath10 is the temperature function and @xmath11 is the pressure function .",
