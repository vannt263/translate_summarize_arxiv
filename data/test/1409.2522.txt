    "the discovery of a higgs boson  @xcite and the lack of evidence for beyond the standard model ( sm ) physics has placed natural models of electro - weak symmetry breaking under stress .",
    "most prominently , the framework of supersymmetry ( susy ) for addressing the hierarchy problem is looking more and more constrained  @xcite .",
    "as this situation continues , the possibility that the hierarchy problem , which after all is a theoretical one , is not addressed in the traditional `` natural '' sense should be considered .",
    "we are led to consider other problems facing the sm within frameworks in which the electro - weak scale is tuned .",
    "in this work we will consider a class of models that attempt to explain the flavor structure of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "there are many possible frameworks to get exponential fermion hierarchy from input parameters that are of order one .",
    "these include froggatt - nielsen models  @xcite , fermion profiles in flat  @xcite or warped  @xcite extra dimensions , and models with large anomalous dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , within these frameworks it is quite generic to have hierarchies that are too large .    here",
    "we will focus on models of radiative fermion masses  @xcite . within this framework",
    "the heavy fermions receive their mass at the tree level and light fermions receive a mass through loops of new heavy particles .",
    "there are many realizations of this idea both in the context of supersymmetric models  @xcite and non - supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "the common ingredient of all these models is the inclusion of new states that mediate flavor violation .",
    "the variety of possibilities for quantum numbers and interactions leads to a plethora of models",
    ". an attractive feature of the framework of radiative fermion masses is that the typical mass hierarchy between fermions of adjacent generations is roughly a loop factor ( with variations among models ) , in qualitative agreement with the observed spectra .",
    "a larger hierarchy is , of course , possible , but this requires additional small numbers or approximate symmetries .    in our study",
    "we will use susy as a guiding principle for the particles and interactions that mediate flavor violation . because our starting point is a tuned electro - weak scale , one could have expected that we can forget about susy altogether .",
    "however , as a unique extension of the space - time symmetries of the s - matrix in four dimensions , susy is well motivated at high scales , irrespective of its relevance for setting the electro - weak scale .",
    "indeed , we will find that introducing susy at a high scale ( a pev or above ) automatically includes all of the necessary ingredients to mediate flavor violation from the third generation fermions to those of the first and second families .",
    "a lower susy scale would also yield a similar fermion mass spectrum but at the cost of introducing unacceptably high rates of flavor changing neutral current processes . in this sense , when enumerating the benefits of supersymmetry , we are trading a few orders of magnitude in its solution to the hierarchy problem for an explanation of flavor .",
    "the minimal model we will consider is remarkably simple - it is a scaled up version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , with supersymmetry broken at or above a pev and with tree level yukawas just for the third generation .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is assumed to be flavor anarchical and flavor violation is mediated from the third to the lighter generations at 1-loop .",
    "this simple setup will yield a spectrum that is qualitatively similar to observation , with a fully hierarchical spectrum and hierarchical mixings .",
    "the minimal setup will have a few quantitative problems which will be addressed subsequently .",
    "our framework differs from many other models of radiative fermion masses in that both the second and first generations receive a mass at the 1-loop level .",
    "one may worry that this generically does not give a hierarchical spectrum , but one in which the first and second generations are nearly degenerate .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "as we shall see , thanks to a novel mechanism , the typical spectrum in our framework is fully hierarchical , typically giving a ratio of @xmath0 for first to second generation masses",
    ". ratios of order one are not achievable .",
    "it should be noted that this small ratio is not the result of a small parameter or of a symmetry at the lagrangian level .",
    "instead it arises due to symmetry properties of the loop _ integrand _ which mediates flavor violation , which are approximately preserved at the integral level .",
    "we will discuss the main mechanism qualitatively in section  [ sec : mechanism ] . in section  [ sec : spectrum ]",
    "we will discuss the fermion spectrum in the minimal model quantitatively , both in the mass insertion approximation and by performing a numerical scan .",
    "we also discuss the constraints that vacuum stability place on the model .",
    "an examination of quark mixing will be presented in section  [ sec : mixing ] , where we will consider the cases of flavor conserving and flavor violating @xmath1-terms separately . in section  [ sec : mod ] we will consider modifications of the minimal model that allow for milder hierarchies in the fermion spectrum , particularly raising the muon mass . in section  [ sec : unification ] we comment on the compatibility of our frameworks with gauge and yukawa coupling unification . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "experimental values for the quark and lepton masses as well as ckm parameters are collected in appendix  [ app : masses ] .",
    "a brief discussion of vacuum stability constraints in the presence of generic sfermion flavor mixing can be found in appendix  [ app : vac ] .",
    "finally , in appendices  [ app : flavor ] and  [ app : higgs ] we discuss constraints from low energy flavor observables and the higgs mass .",
    "we will begin by considering the most minimal setup to demonstrate the mechanism for radiative generation of flavor by sfermions .",
    "this simple setup will yield a fermion spectrum that is qualitatively similar to that observed in the sm , that of a hierarchical spectrum of fermion masses . in this section",
    "we will focus on the origin of the hierarchy .",
    "we will asses its success qualitatively in the next two section .",
    "this minimal setup has been considered briefly in the context of tev scale susy  @xcite , only to be dismissed because of excessive flavor changing effects and/or the lack of naturalness .",
    "giving - up on naturalness frees us to consider this model and some of its virtues in greater detail .",
    "the particle content of the minimal setup includes just the particles of the mssm with a high susy breaking scale and a tuned electro - weak scale ( the spectrum is _ not _ split as in split - susy  @xcite , distinguishing our model from  @xcite ) . in the susy limit",
    "we assume only a single generation of fermions participates in a yukawa interaction with the higgs .",
    "we can thus rotate to a basis in which the yukawa matrices take the form @xmath2 this form can easily be arranged by assuming that matter interacts with the higgs only through mixing with a single generation of heavy vector - like chiral superfields which ensures the yukawa matrix is of rank 1 ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this yukawa interaction respects a global @xmath3 flavor symmetry , with one @xmath4 acting on the first two generations for each of the the @xmath5 and @xmath6 representations .",
    "in addition to generating a mass for the third generation , the couplings of equation  ( [ eq : yukawa - tree ] ) induce non - holomorphic scalar trilinear terms of the form @xmath7 which obviously respect the same symmetry .",
    "the mass scale of all superpartners , including scalars , gauginos and higgsinos , will be set by a common susy breaking scale , @xmath8 which we will take to be at or above 1000 tev . for",
    "now , we will assume that susy breaking trilinear terms such as @xmath9 are aligned in flavor space with the tree level yukawa matrix of equation  ( [ eq : yukawa - tree ] ) , respecting the @xmath3 flavor symmetry @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 also of order @xmath8 .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in section  [ sec : aterms ] .",
    "in contrast , we assume that the scalar masses are _ completely anarchical _ , with a texture @xmath14 as a result , after susy breaking the flavor symmetry is completely broken .",
    "flavor violation will be mediated to the first and second generation fermions by loops of squarks and sleptons and the full yukawa matrix is generated at 1-loop .",
    "the dominant diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : diagrams1 ] .",
    "we note that in the case mixing in the up - top and charm - top sector , quark field renormalization diagrams contribute at the same order as the vertex correction shown in figure  [ fig : diagrams1](a ) .",
    "however , the affect of these 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 entries on the fermion mass spectrum will be suppressed by the large top mass and will not affect the discussion of section  [ sec : mechanism2 ] . in the down and lepton sectors ,",
    "the field renormalization diagrams are suppressed by @xmath15 compared to the vertex corrections and can be neglected .",
    "we will now examine the fermion mass matrices that result from this minimal setup in greater detail and show that the mass spectrum is fully hierarchical .",
    "run over the mass eigenstates of left- and right - handed sfermions .",
    "contributions to second generation masses as well as flavor off - diagonal masses are generated by analogous diagrams.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    run over the mass eigenstates of left- and right - handed sfermions .",

    "contributions to second generation masses as well as flavor off - diagonal masses are generated by analogous diagrams.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]      given our setup above it is clear that there will be a hierarchy of at least a loop factor between the third generation and the lighter two .",
    "one may worry , however , that because both the first and second generation masses are generated at 1-loop , they will be roughly degenerate and that additional flavor structure in equation  ( [ eq : scalar - mass ] ) will be needed to explain the first - second generation mass splittings .",
    "we show here that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , even with fully anarchical scalar masses , _ our model is incapable of producing a degenerate electron and muon , and a mass splitting of order 100 is typical_. the same holds for quarks .    for concreteness ,",
    "let us consider the mass matrix of up - type quarks .",
    "the dominant contribution to the quark mass matrix , @xmath16 , has the form @xmath17 by construction , @xmath18 is a matrix of rank 1 which can be written in a basis in which only its bottom - right entry is non - zero as in equation  ( [ eq : yukawa - tree ] ) .",
    "we will now show that @xmath19 is approximately a rank 1 matrix that is not aligned with @xmath18 and thus gives a mass dominantly to the second generation .",
    "the first generation mass arises only to the degree that  @xmath19 deviates from rank 1 .    evaluating the loop integral from diagram ( a ) in figure  [ fig : diagrams1 ] ,",
    "we can write the loop induced mass matrix  @xmath19 as @xmath20 where the @xmath21 s are the mixing matrices from the left - handed and right - handed squarks , and we have already performed a wick rotation .",
    "it is useful to re - write the loop induced mass as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in equation  ( [ eq : int ] )",
    "we also converted the @xmath25 integral to an integral over @xmath26 ( recall that we already wick rotated ) .",
    "the object @xmath27 is a vector in flavor space which depends on @xmath28 and decides which fermion receives a mass from any given loop scale .",
    "it is interesting to note that for large loop momenta , @xmath29 , @xmath30 points purely in the third generation direction due to the unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath31 . to further investigate the properties of @xmath32",
    ", we normalize the @xmath30 s to unit vectors and rewrite @xmath33 where the unit vectors are @xmath34 in the last step we have used the unitarity of the squark mixing matrix .",

    "every fixed slice of loop momentum contributes mass to just one linear combination of fermions , and the integral is required to give mass to other fermions . *",
    "the magnitude of the loop integrand , @xmath40 is a peaked function , dominated at the susy breaking scale @xmath8 .",
    "it rises like @xmath41 for low @xmath39 and falls like @xmath42 at high @xmath39 s .",
    "this means that the radiatively generated fermion mass will be approximately aligned with the integrand evaluated at the scale @xmath43 .",
    "combining these observations gives us the following narrative for the hierarchy among the second and first generations : the loop momenta that dominate the loop integral , which are of order @xmath43 , give a mass to just one linear combination of fermions .",
    "we can define this combination as the second generation .",
    "as we vary @xmath39 away from @xmath8 , by the time the @xmath30 s are sufficiently mis - aligned to contribute mass to the first generation the loop integrand is already small and the first generation mass is suppressed . note that this mechanism is independent of the flavor structure in the scalar sector and is present even when the scalar masses are fully anarchic .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    the top yukawa coupling is of order one by construction .",

    "it is thus attractive to take a large value for @xmath68 , allowing for bottom and tau yukawa couplings of order one .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the second generation mass , as expected , is a 1-loop factor below the third generation .",

    "we thus find that the @xmath68 scaling which was suppressing the bottom and @xmath77 masses is un - done for the second generation .",

    "we view this as a desirable feature .",

    ", we pause to consider the constraint that vacuum stability places on our parameter space .",
    "a supersymmetric theory invariably introduces many colored and charged scalars and care must be taken to ensure our electro - weak breaking vacuum is stable , or at least meta - stable .",
    "the first consideration is to ensure none of the charged and colored scalars are tachionic , namely , the eigenvalues of the anarchic scalar mass - squared matrices must all be positive .",
    "as off - diagonal entries in a hermitian matrix always cause a lower determinant , it is clear that requiring positive eigenvalues bounds them from above .",
    "the analytic form of the upper bound on any particular flavor violating mass insertion depends on the other entries of the mass matrix and is not enlightening for our discussion . in practice we find that the flavor violation mass insertions tend to be less than 1/2 . in the next subsection we will take a pragmatic approach , and scan over all anarchic scalar mass matrices .",
    "matrices that produce one or more tachyons in their spectrum are simply discarded .",
    "we note that the 2 - 3 and 1 - 2 fermion mass hierarchies are set by the off - diagonal mass insertions @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the vacuum stability requirement thus pushes our fermion mass spectrum to be somewhat more hierarchical than it would have been without this constraint .",
    "even if all scalars have a positive mass - squared , we also need to consider more distant color and charge breaking vacua to which our vacuum can decay .",
    "the radiatively induced fermion masses depend sensitively on the stop trilinear coupling @xmath11 ( in the case of the up - type quarks ) and on the non - holomorphic trilinear which is set by @xmath81 ( in the case of down - type quarks and the leptons ) . like any trilinear term",
    ", these interactions may induce new minima , or runaway directions .",
    "in particular , it is well known  @xcite , that a large stop trilinear can induce a deep charge and color breaking minimum in the mssm scalar potential along the d - flat direction @xmath82 . requiring that the electro - weak vacuum is the deepest minimum in the mssm scalar potential leads to a bound on the stop trilinear coupling @xmath83 this bound",
    "is derived under the assumption of flavor conserving squark soft masses . in the general case with @xmath58 squark mixing ,",
    "the bound can be stronger as discussed in the appendix  [ app : vac ] . if one allows the electro - weak vacuum to decay , and only demands that its life - time be longer than the age of the universe , the bound gets slightly relaxed  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the stop trilinear coupling constrains the size of the radiatively induced charm and up masses .",
    "note that the constraint  ( [ eq : atbound ] ) on the relative size of the trilinear coupling with respect to the soft masses is independent on the overall mass scale .",
    "this statement remains approximately true also if one allows for a meta - stable vacuum .    for large values of  @xmath81 ,",
    "vacua with sbottom or stau vevs can appear in the mssm scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "even if there are no exact d - flat directions involving only the up - type higgs and sbottoms or staus , the trilinear couplings of the up - type higgs with the sbottoms and staus can lead to charge and color breaking minima , if the product of higgsino mass and bottom / tau yukawa is of the order of the squark / slepton soft masses .",
    "simple analytical bounds for the higgsino mass equivalent to  ( [ eq : atbound ] ) can only be obtained for a fixed direction in field space . for any given field direction ,",
    "the bounds are only necessary but usually not sufficient to guarantee the absence of charge and color breaking minima . in the large @xmath68 regime , we find that in the optimized field direction @xmath84 is usually a bit larger than the sfermion fields . for definiteness we chose here exemplarily @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    ", the situation can improve by increasing both muon and electron masses , while keeping their ratio fixed .",
    "we now turn to examining quark mixing , i.e. the misalignment of the left - handed up and down quarks in flavor space . we will find that in the minimal model quark mixing is generated radiatively , but that the cabibbo angle is typically too small .",
    "we will then show that this can be addressed simply by allowing for flavor violating trilinear terms .      just like fermion masses ,",

    ", we will first get a qualitative understanding of the result , and then proceed to consider the results analytically ( in the mass insertion approximation ) and numerically ( without approximation ) .",
    "as was the case for the fermion masses , it is enlightening to inspect the loop induced contribution to the ckm matrix at the _ integrand _ level , because symmetries that are exact for the integrand are manifested approximately at the integral level due to the dominance of a single scale . purposely dropping the loop integral , the up - type and down - type mass matrices have the following structure @xmath104 to see the parametric structure of the ckm matrix we can pick a convenient basis .",
    "obviously , we will want to work in a basis where only the 33 entry of @xmath18 is non - zero .",
    "we can further do @xmath4 rotations between the lighter generations such that @xmath105 . in this basis",
    "both the up and the down matrices in equation  ( [ eq : up - and - down ] ) are non - vanishing only in the lower two - by - two diagonal block .",
    "these matrices can thus be diagonalized with a rotation between the second and third generation .",
    "the relative left handed rotation between them , which is the ckm matrix , will also be purely a 2 - 3 rotation . recalling that the structure of equation  ( [ eq : up - and - down ] ) is merely approximate , we expect a suppression of the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 ckm entries .",
    "the ckm matrix is fully determined by four parameters .",
    "we chose the cabibbo angle @xmath106 and the absolute values of the ckm elements @xmath107 and @xmath108 as well as the ckm phase .",
    "our expectation from above is that @xmath108 and @xmath109 will be suppressed . using the same approximations as in section  [ sec : minimal_analytic ] , we find the following analytic expressions    @xmath110    these expressions have to be compared to the measured values that are collected in the appendix  [ app : masses ] .",
    "the physical phase of the ckm matrix is generically of @xmath58 in our model , in agreement with observation .",
    "the smallness of the ckm element @xmath107 is explained by a loop factor .",
    "its measured value can be easily accommodated in the large @xmath68 regime .",
    "as explained above , the loop induced quark mass matrices are approximately rank 1 , and mixing between the first and third generation is therefore suppressed by a small numerical factor . the resulting expression for the ckm element",
    "@xmath108 is smaller than @xmath107 by one order of magnitude , exactly as observed .",
    "finally , the cabibbo angle @xmath106 is not loop suppressed because it parametrizes the mixing between the first and second generation of quarks , which both acquire mass at the same loop level .",
    "however , again due to the fact that the loop induced quark mass matrices are approximately rank 1 , the cabibbo angle is suppressed by a small numerical factor .",
    "moreover , the mixing between the first and second generation of left handed quarks is proportional to @xmath111 and aligned in the up and down sectors at leading order in mass insertions .",
    "the cabibbo angle is therefore only induced at higher order in the mass insertion approximation , involving also the mixing of right handed quarks .",
    "this double suppression leads to a very small value of @xmath106 . even setting the mass insertions in  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) to 1",

    "the next section will describe ways to increase the cabibbo angle .",
    "we now consider the possibility that all soft terms , both masses and trilinears , violate the flavor symmetry .",
    "traditionally , in supersymmetric theories the @xmath1-terms are taken to be proportional to the yukawa matrices for several reasons - constraints on flavor changing neutral currents , vacuum stability , as well as model building considerations .",
    "flavor alignment is certainly motivated from a model building point of view but is not necessary - one could imagine writing an operator of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a hidden sector field that gets an @xmath116-term vev and @xmath117 is a messenger scale .",
    "the matrix @xmath118 need not be proportional to the yukawa matrix . indeed , in gravity mediation , where @xmath117 is the planck scale , the lore is that the theory of quantum gravity does not respect any flavor symmetries and one could naively expect @xmath119 in equation  ( [ eq : fvaterm ] ) to be not aligned with the yukawa matrix .    the constraints on flavor violating @xmath1-terms from flavor changing neutral currents are avoided in our framework due to the large supersymmetry breaking scale , but constraints from vacuum stability certainly do need to be considered .",
    "trilinear scalar terms can always drive an instability at large field values unless they are countered by a sufficiently large quadratic term . in the mssm the supersymmetric yukawa terms serve as stabilizing quartic couplings .",
    "if the @xmath1-terms are significantly not aligned with these yukawas , a runaway direction may arise .",
    "completely anarchic trilinear couplings are therefore subject to strong constraints from vacuum stability  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "soft trilinear couplings of the first and second generation as well as trilinears that mix the first with the second generation are strongly constrained , because f - term quartics for the first and second generation sfermions are absent at tree level in the considered framework .",
    "flavor changing trilinear couplings involving the third generation are less constrained because they are at least partially aligned with the yukawa couplings .",
    "focusing on flavor changing trilinears in the up sector , we write @xmath120 necessary bounds on the flavor changing trilinears in the up sector read  @xcite    @xmath121    in general it is possible to derive stronger bounds by optimizing the direction in field space . limiting ourselves to the case discussed below , namely the presence of @xmath11 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 trilinear couplings , and assuming for simplicity flavor diagonal soft masses , we find the following bound @xmath124 with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",

    "we recover the bound on @xmath11 given in  ( [ eq : atbound ] ) ; for @xmath130 and @xmath131 we obtain the first bound in equation  ( [ eq : fcabound ] ) , etc .",
    "similar to the case of the flavor conserving trilinears discussed in section  [ sec : stability ] , the vacuum stability bounds can become tighter , if one takes into account also flavor violation in the soft masses .",
    "the bounds will be slightly relaxed if one demands only meta - stability  @xcite .",
    "our philosophy for flavor violating @xmath1-terms will be similar to flavor violating soft masses : we will allow anarchic flavor violation so long as it does not cause a vacuum instability .",
    "for the soft masses this amounted to checking that there are no tachyons in the spectrum , but for trilinears the requirement is that no runaway or instability is caused at large field values . in practice",
    "this implies that only trilinears that involve the third family can be turned on .    in the following , we consider the effect of switching on a small flavor changing @xmath122 and  @xmath123 trilinear coupling .",
    "it is well known that flavor changing trilinear couplings can lead to large corrections to the ckm matrix elements  @xcite . in general",
    "we expect this new source of flavor violation to mildly spoil the approximate rank 1 structure described in section  [ sec : mechanism ] .",
    "we thus expect the up quark mass , as well as @xmath106 and @xmath108 to be particularly sensitive to the flavor changing trilinears . to understand the dependence of these parameters on the flavor violating @xmath1-terms we employ the mass insertion approximation defined in section  [ sec : minimal_analytic ] , working to leading order in @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "both flavor changing trilinears , @xmath122 and @xmath123 affect the up quark mass @xmath137 for @xmath138 , the shift in the up quark mass is of @xmath58 and therefore does not change the predicted hierarchy between up and charm mass significantly .    .",

    "is greatly improved compared to the scan without flavor changing trilinears .",
    "flavor violating trilinear couplings in the down sector can lead to additional contributions to the down mass matrix and in turn also affect the ckm matrix .",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed by @xmath15 with respect to the leading contributions that are induced by the flavor conserving supersymmetric trilinear couplings proportional to the @xmath81 term  ( [ eq : mutrilinear ] ) . as a consequence , effects from flavor violating trilinears in the down sector are insignificant .",
    "another possibility would be to introduce flavor violating trilinear couplings in the down sector that are non - holomorphic and therefore not suppressed by @xmath15 . a non - holomorphic @xmath140 coupling with absolute values approximately 10% of the @xmath81 term would have similar effects on the ckm matrix as @xmath122 discussed above .",
    "a non - holomorphic @xmath141 coupling of the same order as the @xmath81 term could be used to enhance the down quark mass by a factor of few without affecting the ckm matrix significantly .",
    "however , flavor violating non - holomorphic a - terms in the down sector are strongly constrained by vacuum stability considerations .",
    "we find that with trilinear couplings of the type @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the mssm tree level potential is unbounded from below .",
    "the electro - weak minimum can still be metastable in such a situation  @xcite , but a dedicated analysis to establish the maximal values for @xmath141 and @xmath140 compatible with meta - stability bounds is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in section  [ sec : spectrum ] we saw that our minimal setup , the mssm with third generation yukawas and anarchic soft masses , successfully generates a hierarchical fermion spectrum . when compared to the observed hierarchy we find that , if anything , the hierarchy is too large . in particular ,",
    "the ratio of the muon to tau mass is predicted to be too small . in this section",
    "we will consider variations to the minimal framework which yield a milder hierarchy .",
    "the first possibility we consider , still within the minimal model , is to allow for hard supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the second alternative we will discuss , is to extend the gauge structure beyond that of the mssm .",
    "so far we have considered a scaled up version of the traditional softly broken supersymmetric standard model .",
    "introducing only soft susy breaking is certainly well motivated by naturalness . but given that we have given up on electro - weak naturalness in the first paragraph of this paper , it is reasonable to consider also hard breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "here we define hard breaking as any symmetry breaking by a dimensionless coupling . for practical purposes we will consider such breaking of supersymmetry as a limit of soft supersymmetry breaking models by taking the supersymmetry breaking vev @xmath116 to be of the same order as the messenger scale @xmath144 . then , dimensionless susy breaking operators can be categorized in powers of @xmath145  @xcite .    for our purposes",
    ", we will be interested in the possibility that the bino - fermion - sfermion vertex is larger than the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath146 . within our framework",
    "this can come from the operator @xmath147 we will assume that this new source of supersymmetry breaking is flavor blind , allowing the main mechanisms we have discussed to remain intact . we note that relaxing this assumption somewhat may be interesting as an alternative to the flavor violating trilinears discussed in subsection  [ sec : aterms ] .",
    "the scale @xmath116 may be the only source of supersymmetry breaking , in which case _ the _ mediation mechanism may be low scale .",
    "alternatively , there can be two sources of susy breaking giving two different scales @xmath148 and @xmath149 . the scale @xmath148 can be coupled to the mssm via gravity mediation giving rise to the lions share of soft masses .",
    "the scale @xmath149 can be coupled via a low scale mediation , @xmath150 , which contributes up to an order one of the soft masses as well as some hard breaking of the form of equation  ( [ eq : hard ] ) .",
    "a setup like this fits our framework well because the high - scale gravity mediation is expected to be flavor anarchic while the low scale mediation could be flavor blind .",
    "increasing the bino - fermion - sfermion coupling @xmath151 from its supersymmetric value @xmath146 , will modify the fermion spectrum in our model .",
    "in particular , both the electron and muon masses will be shifted by a factor of @xmath152 .",
    "this will improve the agreement of these masses with observation significantly as can be seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : hard_bl ] where we have taken @xmath151 to be twice its supersymmetric value .",
    "this distribution is similar to that in figure  [ fig:1st2nd_mssm ] with all points shifted by a factor of four along the diagonal line .",
    "we note that introducing significant hard susy breaking generically also leads to larger radiative corrections to third generation masses ( the parameters we called @xmath67 ) .     number . in both cases",
    "the agreement may be improved by increasing the relevant couplings , see text for details.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    number . in both cases",
    "the agreement may be improved by increasing the relevant couplings , see text for details.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    increasing @xmath151 does not affect the quark masses significantly as these were dominated by squark - gluino loops .",
    "increasing the quark masses with hard susy breaking is possible for example by increasing the quark - squark - gluino vertex @xmath153 in a similar way .",
    "increasing the first and second generation masses by a common factor does indeed bring the bulk of our scan models closer to observation .",
    "however we note that the observed quark masses are certainly achievable within our minimal framework .    finally , we note that hard supersymmetry breaking may affect the higgs mass .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : higgs ] , our frameworks requires lowering the higgs mass compared to the standard supersymmetric prediction .",
    "we discuss this further in that appendix .",
    "we now return to the framework of traditional softly broken supersymmetry and consider and alternative solution to raising the muon mass . in our minimal framework",
    "the mass ratio of second to third generation fermions is a function of the gauge representations and the mssm gauge couplings .",
    "a simple possibility to generating a milder hierarchy in the lepton sector is to assume that additional gauge symmetries are present at the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "indeed , decades of studying tev scale supersymmetry has taught us that @xmath154 is a natural scale for spontaneously broken gauge symmetries .",
    "any additional gauge symmetry under which both left and right handed matter transforms will include new diagrams similar to those in figure  [ fig : diagrams1 ] but with a new gaugino .",
    "there are several ways one could envision enlarging the gauge structure of the mssm and we will leave a more complete analysis of the most motivated possibilities for future study . here ,",
    "as a simple example we consider gauging @xmath155 in addition to the sm gauge group .",
    "the @xmath155 gauge symmetry can naturally be spontaneously broken at the scale of supersymmetry breaking @xmath8 . due to their larger charge , lepton masses",
    "would be affected by the new @xmath155 gaugino diagrams more than quarks . as opposed to the case of hard susy breaking , where we needed to assume the new contribution is flavor universal , in this case flavor universality is ensured by @xmath155 gauge invariance and the hierarchical structure of section  [ sec : mechanism ] is automatically maintained . in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hard_bl ]",
    "we show the effects of including a @xmath155 gauge interaction whose coupling strength is @xmath156 at the pev scale .",
    "this value is chosen by requiring that the landau pole in the @xmath155 coupling is postponed until the gut scale , thus maintaining the success of gauge coupling unification and hypercharge that is induced by rge s",
    "@xcite or add additional matter that renders the two sets of charges orthogonal . ] .",
    "comparing this to figure  [ fig:1st2nd_mssm ] , we conclude that gauging @xmath155 can bring the value of lepton masses within the range predicted by our framework .    of course , one can bring the most `` likely '' values of the muon mass closer to the observed value by increasing the @xmath155 coupling .",
    "this may be done at the cost of introducing a landau pole below the the canonical gut scale .",
    "unification of gauge couplings would still be possible in this case if it is accelerated  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could embed the @xmath155 into a larger non - abelian group which is asymptotically free before the landau pole .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath155 is brought here as an example of how adding gauge structure around the supersymmetry breaking scale can improve our predicted lepton spectrum . turning this statement around",
    "we can consider the degree of hierarchy in the various sm representations as an indication of their gauge charges at  @xmath8 .",
    "taking this seriously may suggest a gauge symmetry under which leptons are charged fairly strongly , such as pati - salam models  @xcite .",
    "we leave this line of inquiry for an upcoming publication .",
    "we now discuss the compatibility of our framework with unification of gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "the discussion here applies to the minimal model and its extension in section  [ sec : hard ] . as stated above , the the compatibility of the @xmath155 extension of section  [ sec : b - l ] warrants further study .",
    "one of the attractive features of tev scale susy is that it is compatible with gauge coupling unification at a gut scale around @xmath157 gev  @xcite . given the existing constraints on flavor changing neutral current processes , the anarchic scalar masses in our framework must be of order 1  pev or above .",
    "as is shown in figure  [ fig : gaugeunification ] , gauge coupling unification is still compatible with a susy breaking scale of a pev .",
    "for the running of the gauge couplings we use 2-loop rges .",
    "up to the pev scale we use the sm rges  @xcite and above the pev scale we use those of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "we neglect threshold corrections at the susy scale . in that case ,",

    "they are approximately given by @xmath164 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 given in  ( [ eq : eps ] ) .",
    "note that requiring third generation yukawa unification does not spoil the successful generation of the first and second generation quark and lepton masses .",
    "we checked explicitly that enforcing bottom - tau unification by requiring @xmath160 and @xmath161 to lie within the corresponding band shown in figure  [ fig : yukawaunification ] , does not change the distribution of the radiatively induced fermion masses and quark mixing angles appreciably .",
    "models of radiative fermion masses are an elegant and attractive possibility to explain the hierarchical flavor pattern in the mass spectrum and mixing angles of the quarks and leptons in terms of loop factors . in this work , we discussed setups that allow to generate the hierarchical flavor structure of the sm fermions from loops of superpartners with anarchical soft masses . given the anarchic squark and slepton masses , the discussed setups are subject to strong constraints from low energy flavor observables .",
    "in particular , cp violation in kaon mixing generically sets the strongest lower bound on the susy scale of the order of @xmath165  pev .",
    "a spectrum with all susy particles at the pev scale is still compatible with gauge coupling unification and also with third generation yukawa unification at a gut scale of around @xmath166  gev .",
    "we found that the minimal supersymmetric standard model with flavor anarchic soft masses for the squarks and sleptons contains all necessary ingredients to generate a fully hierarchical spectrum of quarks and leptons . at tree level ,",
    "rank 1 yukawas couple the higgs only to the third generation fermions and leave a @xmath3 symmetry acting on the first and second generation unbroken .",
    "the anarchic sfermion soft masses , on the other hand , break the sm flavor symmetry completely .",
    "loops containing gauginos and sfermions communicate the flavor symmetry breaking from the sfermion sector in the fermion sector and yukawa couplings for the first and second generation fermions are generated at the 1-loop level . while both first and second generation yukawas are generated at the 1-loop level , we pointed out a novel mechanism that ensures a large splitting , of generically two orders of magnitude , without introducing small parameters or symmetries .",
    "we showed that the radiatively induced yukawa matrices are approximately rank 1 . in combination with the rank 1 tree level yukawas",
    ", they result in yukawa couplings that contain one very small eigenvalue ; the corresponding eigenstates are identified with the first generation and the obtained fermion mass spectrum is fully hierarchical .",
    "quark mixing is generically also very hierarchical . mixing between the second and third as well as between the first and third generation",
    "is induced at the one loop level .",
    "smallness of mixing between the first and second generation is guaranteed by the approximate rank 1 nature of the radiatively induced yukawa matrix .",
    "the qualitative picture agrees well with the observed sm fermion spectrum and quark mixing angles . at the quantitative level we find that our minimal framework can accommodate almost all observed flavor parameters . starting with mixing angles : if the only source of flavor violation is the scalar soft masses the cabibbo angle is found to be too small",
    "however , @xmath106 can easily be brought in agreement with experiment if trilinear couplings also violate flavor , to the degree that is allowed by vacuum stability .",
    "the additional flavor breaking adds an order one contribution to the up mass , which if dressed by a gluon can lead to a chromo - edm .",
    "the edm phenomenology of this scenario would thus be interesting to explore .",

    "we discussed various extensions of the minimal setup that allow to accommodate also the measured muon mass while keeping the electron - to - muon mass ratio fixed .",
    "one way to obtain a larger muon mass is to allow for hard susy breaking in the form of lepton - slepton - bino couplings that are larger than the hypercharge gauge coupling by a factor of @xmath58 .",

    "the radiative mechanism of fermion mass generation discussed in this work requires @xmath58 flavor mixing in the sfermion soft masses .",
    "such flavor mixing is subject to strong constraints from low energy flavor observables  @xcite . in particular cp violation in kaon",
    "mixing , given by the observable @xmath191 , is exceedingly sensitive to the mixing between the first two generations of down - type squarks . in order not to spoil the reasonable agreement between the experimental results and the sm prediction for @xmath191",
    ", we find that the susy scale @xmath8 has to be of the order of few pev .",
    "we expect this to be the strongest bound on the susy breaking scale in our model .    in the presence of large sfermion mixing it is known that also electric dipole moments ( edms ) are generically very sensitive low energy probes of heavy supersymmetric particles .",
    "current experimental bounds on edms of the neutron and electron can probe squarks and sleptons with masses of o(100 )  tev  @xcite , and prospects for further experimental improvements are excellent .",
    "however , in the framework of radiative fermion masses , there is the potential of an approximate phase alignment between the light fermion masses and the corresponding dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "this is because the leading contributions to the dipole come from dressing the leading 1-loop diagram for the mass by a gluon or a photon .",
    "however , in some of our models , the mass of the first generation fermions came from more than one diagram .",
    "in particular , once flavor violating trilinears were introduced in section  [ sec : aterms ] , the up mass received comparable contributions from soft masses and @xmath1-terms , as seen in equation  ( [ eq : up_mass ] ) . in this case",
    "we expect the mass and the dipole to be misaligned .",
    "a full exploration of the edm phenomenology is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "the gray bands exemplarily indicate the @xmath192 and @xmath74 uncertainties coming from the top mass , strong gauge coupling , and the higgs mass.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as squarks are very heavy in the discussed framework ( at least few pev in order to avoid constraints from kaon mixing ) , the sm - like higgs is predicted to be somewhat heavier than the observed value of @xmath193  gev . in the high scale susy scenario that we are working in , the observed higgs mass is reproduced for a susy scale of around 10 tev if @xmath194  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : mhiggs ] we show in the plane of the susy scale and @xmath68 the threshold corrections @xmath195 to the higgs quartic coupling that are required at the susy scale in order to obtain a higgs mass of 125.5 gev . at the susy scale",
    "we set the higgs quartic to @xmath196 \\cos^2 2\\beta + \\delta \\lambda ~.\\ ] ] we use sm 2-loop rges  @xcite for the evolution of the higgs quartic between the susy scale and the electro - weak scale , taking into account contributions from all gauge couplings and the top yukawa .",
    "we incorporate 2-loop threshold corrections at the electro - weak scale from  @xcite .",
    "the gray band in the plot of figure  [ fig : mhiggs ] exemplarily shows the @xmath192 and @xmath74 uncertainty on the required threshold corrections at the susy scale , taking into account the uncertainty on the top quark pole mass @xmath197  gev  @xcite , the strong gauge coupling @xmath198  @xcite , and the higgs mass @xmath199  gev  gev  @xcite and the cms result @xmath200  gev  @xcite . ] .    for @xmath194 ,",
    "the required threshold corrections are at the level of @xmath201 for a pev scale spectrum .",
    "note that sizable stop trilinear couplings @xmath202 typically lead to positive threshold corrections of the order of @xmath203 .",
    "a very large stop trilinear @xmath204 would lead to negative corrections .",
    "however , such a large @xmath11 is in conflict with vacuum stability constraints , see  ( [ eq : atbound ] ) .",
    "various viable mechanisms exist that lead to negative threshold corrections .",
    "one example is to add a singlet @xmath205 with a susy mass @xmath206 that couples to the mssm higgs bosons @xmath207 the additional scalar modifies the higgs potential and leads to a shift in the higgs quartic .",
    "we find @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the soft mass squared for the scalar component of  @xmath205 and we expanded in large  @xmath210 .",
    "the first term in parenthesis proportional to the soft mass squared gives a positive definite contribution to the higgs quartic , but it is completely negligible in the large @xmath68 regime .",
    "the remaining terms are proportional to the supersymmetric masses @xmath206 and @xmath81 and can reduce the higgs quartic . as long as @xmath206 is not too heavy , moderate @xmath211 can easily lead to threshold corrections of the required size .",
    "another avenue to lower the tree level higgs mass is a hard susy breaking negative quartic coupling . as discussed in section  [ sec : hard ] , hard susy breaking can help in raising the muon mass in our framework .",
    "the only hard susy breaking operator that enters at order @xmath145 in the mssm is  @xcite @xmath212 this operator however leads to a @xmath68 suppressed quartic . to lower the higgs mass in our framework we need to write @xmath213 the value of @xmath214 needed to increase the muon mass ( of order @xmath146 ) is sufficient to lower the higss mass to its observed value .",
    "finally , we note that another option is to make the gauginos dirac fermions  @xcite .",
    "notice that a sizeable majorana mass for the gauginos is a necessary ingredient for our mechanism to work , therefore one would need same order majorana and dirac fermion masses for the gauginos .",

    "<S> we present a framework to generate the hierarchical flavor structure of standard model quarks and leptons from loops of superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model consists of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with tree level yukawa couplings for the third generation only and anarchic squark and slepton mass matrices . agreement with constraints from low energy flavor observables , in particular kaon mixing , is obtained for supersymmetric particles with masses at the pev scale or above . in our framework </S>",
    "<S> both the second and the first generation fermion masses are generated at 1-loop . despite this , a novel mechanism generates a hierarchy among the first and second generations without imposing a symmetry or small parameters </S>",
    "<S> . a second - to - first generation mass ratio of order 100 is typical . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal supersymmetric standard model thus includes all the necessary ingredients to realize a fermion spectrum that is qualitatively similar to observation , with hierarchical masses and mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal framework produces only a few quantitative discrepancies with observation , most notably the muon mass is too low . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss simple modifications which resolve this and also investigate the compatibility of our model with gauge and yukawa coupling unification . </S>"
