    "it is well known that plastic deformation of crystalline materials is caused by the motion of a large number of interacting dislocations .",
    "although the properties of individual dislocations have been known for decades , the question how to build up a micron - scale level continuum description of dislocations is still an unresolved issue in the theory of crystal plasticity .",
    "the appropriate continuum theory could provide a framework for understanding dislocation pattern formation or size - effects .",
    "several phenomenological models have been proposed for dislocation patterning so far . here",
    "we first mention the work of walgraef and aifantis@xcite , who adopted a reaction - diffusion model from the description of oscillating chemical reactions . in their model second - order gradient terms",
    "are introduced to account for the spatial fluctuations of the dislocation density . although the framework turned out to be very successful in the prediction of different dislocation structures , the physical origin of the length scales introduced through the coefficients of the gradient terms",
    "is not really understood .",
    "the same problem applies to the model of kratochvl and co - workers , in which nonlocal terms are introduced for describing spatial interactions through the sweeping mechanism.@xcite    in a non - phenomenological model proposed by groma a system of parallel edge dislocations in single slip was studied.@xcite by performing ensemble averaging on statistically equivalent dislocation distributions a chain of equations for the many - body dislocation density fields was derived .",
    "first , dislocation correlations were neglected , which corresponds to a mean - field approximation.@xcite here the stress acting on dislocations is simply the `` self - consistent '' field , which is the long - range stress field of the geometrically necessary dislocations .",
    "if the dislocation system is correlated , which is indeed the case for real systems ( see , e.g. ,  ref .  ) , new stress - like terms appear in the constitutive equations.@xcite the most important non - trivial term is the gradient - like `` back - stress '' , which can be interpreted as the short - range effect of dislocation pile - ups . in order to check the validity of this two - dimensional ( 2d ) theory , its predictions were compared with discrete dislocation dynamics simulation results and good agreement was found.@xcite    there are several current approaches in the literature to develop a density - based continuum model for three dimensions ( 3d ) .",

    "et al_.  too@xcite for a continuum theory of interacting curved dislocations@xcite . in all",
    "mentioned current 3d continuum theories of dislocation dynamics one of the biggest challenges is the precise incorporation of the effects of dislocation correlations , which seems to be unavoidable .",
    "so , the investigation of the evolution of the correlation properties is of great importance , but even in 2d this problem has not been solved yet .    in the past two years",
    "new light has been shed on equilibrated dislocation systems by the discovery of the effect of dislocation screening .",
    "@xcite its most direct physical significance is that it explains the extensivity of the elastic energy in equilibrium by the appropriate relative arrangement of the dislocations , resulting generically in a finite interaction length rather than the unscreened infinite range interaction . on the technical side , in the simplest example of single slip , 2d , edge dislocation systems ,",
    "an effective thermodynamic potential was proposed for the purpose of the variational calculation of the geometrically necessary density .",
    "summarizing the results , for large and constant total dislocation density and small but variable geometrically necessary density , the equation for the induced density with arbitrary external dislocations was constructed and its green function for infinite boundary conditions was given analytically .",
    "hence the induced density and the resulting screened elastic potential by a single external dislocation was obtained , showing suppression in all directions exponentially strong except for one axis , where it was of power type .",
    "this phenomenon bears close resemblance to debye screening of an external charge in coulomb systems , so this term was adopted also for dislocations . in the same work@xcite numerical results were presented , but because of the prohibitive fluctuations of the dislocation distribution induced by an external , fixed dislocation , rather the signed pair correlation of dislocations in equilibrium was monitored . even in the latter function",
    "an agreement with the theory was found .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the relation between the externally induced density ( response function ) and the correlation function is based on linear response theory in thermal systems . however , in the dislocation system considered presently entropic effects are suppressed , i.e. , thermal fluctuations are negligible beside the peach - koehler forces .",
    "therefore , traditional arguments of linear response theory do not obviously apply .",
    "this raises the question why then the externally induced dislocations obey properties similar to those of correlation functions .",
    "the problem can be actually posed in a broad sense , namely , to what extent the response function to an external particle and the two - particle correlation function , in or off equilibrium , are similar .",
    "the evolution equations for the one - point densities , with some simplifying hypotheses , are known , @xcite and they have been linked to the variational approach by a phase field construction@xcite .",
    "the evolution equations for the two - point correlation functions , however , could not be brought to any treatable form so far .    as a recent development ,",
    "vinogradov and willis published an evolution equation for the correlation function of long parallel screw dislocations with the same burgers vectors.@xcite they even solved the resulting equation for the static case analytically .",
    "it was found , however , that the generalization of this result for the case of two possible burgers vectors ( positive and negative dislocations ) , or for edge dislocations , leads to a solution not decaying at infinity , thus can not be correct physically .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of correlation functions of long parallel edge dislocations with single slip .",
    "we start our analysis with the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy , describing the evolution of dislocation many - body densities , which was derived earlier by groma.@xcite in contrast to the cluster approximation used by vinogradov and willis,@xcite we apply the kirkwood superposition approximation as a method to close the chain of equations .",
    "the resulting equations , when rewritten for appropriately introduced single - point fields , are similar to those describing the evolution of one - dislocation density functions in the presence of a single external dislocation .",
    "in fact they become identical , if the external perturbation is small enough , thus we arrive at the analog of linear response theory in thermal systems , now obtained for density fields at zero temperature .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the relation is now conditioned upon the kirkwood approximation for the two - point correlations . in order to test the extent of the analogy between the one- and two - point densities",
    ", we also performed extensive simulations .",
    "first we compared the equilibrium distributions induced by the screened single external dislocation with the appropriate fields from the two - point correlations , and found a quite satisfactory agreement .",
    "second , the time evolutions of the two types of density fields were matched and again close similarity was observed even before reaching equilibrium .",
    "this essentially demonstrates that the kirkwood closure approximation was justified and the resulting equations indeed well describe the evolution of the correlation functions .",
    "we also analyze the cluster approximation of vinogradov and willis , adopted for edge dislocations , and show that it leads to a physically unacceptable result for the evolution equation of the correlation functions .",

    "we investigate the relaxation of dislocations from a random initial state in an infinite medium at zero external shear stress . since the equations of motion of the dislocations do nt have a direct spatial dependence , the system is invariant under translations . in this case",

    "its steady state solution was calculated by vinogradov and willis for infinite parallel screw dislocations.@xcite their motion was constrained to simple glide in one direction , so the difference between the system studied by them and the one considered in this paper is only the form of the generated stress field of the particles @xmath23 .",
    "they deduced an exact solution for the correlation function when there were only positive screw dislocations .",
    "however , in the case when both positive and negative screw dislocations were present , from the equation for the correlation functions they deduced a mathematical contradiction .",
    "namely , the correlation functions had to tend to a constant nonzero value for large distances , which is obviously incorrect for real dislocation arrangements .",
    "they also showed that this contradiction was independent from the actual form of @xmath23 , which means that for edge dislocations the equations are not solvable either .",
    "we thus speculate that according to this result the cluster approximation is unphysical for the system of parallel edge dislocations .",
    "another traditional method for closing the hierarchy at this order is the kirkwood superposition approximation@xcite , which was successfully used for instance in fluid mechanics ( for a brief overview see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in the context of dislocations ,",
    "it was first introduced by zaiser _",
    "et al_.@xcite but after investigating the resulting equations only a few basic conclusions were drawn .",

    "the phenomenon lends itself to the analogy with debye screening in coulomb systems .    in order to address the problem , groma _",
    "et al._@xcite studied the induced geometrically necessary dislocation density around a single external edge dislocation in 2d , proposed an equation for the stress potential in equilibrium and gave analytic solution for the infinite plane , provided the total density was constant and much larger than the geometrically necessary dislocation density . while this is not the original question of the correlation function , within linear response theory , however , the result is expected to be valid also to the correlation problem .",
    "it was indeed shown that the screened dislocation s stress field decays faster than that of the unscreened one s , in the direction perpendicular to the burgers vector by a power law , and in all other directions exponentially .",
    "this result was actually compared with correlation simulations , mostly because this was numerically simpler than the computation of the induced field by an external dislocation , and in the direction of the power decay not only the exponent but the entire shape predicted by theory was recovered in the simulation .",
    "however , the exponential decay along the @xmath70 axis was not seen as in the theoretical solution , mostly because of the special conditions of dislocation motion on a torus as realized in the simulation . in any event ,",
    "the equivalence of response to an external dislocation and the correlation in the absence of a fixed , external one , was taken as granted , precisely the problem addressed in the present paper .",
    "an important peculiar aspect of screening of dislocations has to be emphasized .",
    "first , we recall that in a thermal system like coulomb plasma linear response theory provides enough ground to expect the similarity between screening of an external charge and that in the correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "the screening problem of dislocations already emerges at zero physical temperature .",
    "now the role of the temperature in keeping oppositely charged particles at distance is taken over by the constraint to slip axes , so here an effective temperature parameter arises that can be determined from comparison with simulation.@xcite now given the fact that we only have a temperature parameter ( which directly appears in the effective thermodynamic potential ) but not usual thermodynamics , it is by far not obvious that the two types of screening , namely , the one of an external dislocation , and the one appearing in the correlation function , should maintain the same type of equivalence as if boltzmannian thermodynamics were valid .",
    "hence , in the case of dislocations it remains an open problem , what the relation is between screening by response to an external effect and screening in the correlations .    in the previous section we constructed the equations of motion for correlations ,",
    "now we do the same for the one - particle densities in the presence of an external dislocation . as a result of the stress field generated by the inserted object , the positions of the other dislocations change and a new relaxed state evolves . in it , for instance ,",
    "one particle dislocation densities wo nt be constant any more . in this section , the time evolution of these functions is investigated .",
    "due to the spatially varying extra force acting on the dislocations the system is not translation invariant any more .",
    "so , in the case of screening of an external dislocation , contrary to the case in the previous section , the system is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "the evolution of the one - particle densities is described by the first member of the bbgky hierarchy ( [ eqn : one_part_evol ] ) : @xmath71 = 0 , \\label{eqn : one_part_evol_screening}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the notation @xmath72 with @xmath73 for the stress field of the extra dislocation .    according to the deduction in ref .  , eq .",

    "to measure @xmath110 , @xmath84 , @xmath111 , and @xmath83 numerically , we first performed more than 13000 different relaxations . in each of them at the beginning 128 dislocations ( 64 with positive and 64 with negative sign ) were distributed randomly in an @xmath112 square - like domain with periodic boundary conditions , and then they relaxed to a steady state .",

    "afterwards , a new dislocation with positive sign was placed at the center of the simulation area in each configuration , and the systems were let to relax again while the extra dislocation was fixed .",
    "these simulations correspond to the phenomena of debye screening of an external dislocation .",
    "the @xmath113 and @xmath114 densities were obtained by counting the number of positive and negative dislocations falling into each cell of a @xmath115 mesh",

    "[ fig : rho_kappa_relaxed],height=283 ]    the two functions , according to our expectations , are quite similar .",
    "the difference is that in the case of @xmath83 and @xmath84 the amplitude of the noise is much higher .",
    "the simple reason for this is that a relaxed system of @xmath8 dislocations gives @xmath118 data ( the relative coordinates ) during the calculation of the correlation functions but only @xmath8 data ( the positions ) when calculating the densities . in order to make a comparison between these functions",
    "the following function was considered : @xmath119 the integral of a noise is nearly constant so if @xmath84 and @xmath110 are equal except for the noise then this quantity must have a minimum at @xmath120 . as it was mentioned in sec .",
