    "in @xcite it was shown that semidefinite programming yields signal recovery with high probability when the @xmath1-dimensional subspaces are chosen at random and that the cardinality of the subspaces can scale linearly in the ambient dimension up to a logarithmic factor . numerical stability in the presence of noise",
    "was also verified .",
    "the underlying semidefinite program was shown in @xcite to afford ( with high probability ) a unique feasible solution , and the logarithmic factor was removed in @xcite .",
    "our proof for @xmath2-dimensional subspaces ( see theorem [ th : finale ! ] ) is guided by the approach in @xcite but some steps are more involved and require additional tools . for instance , the case @xmath18 relies on random vectors whose entries are i.i.d .",
