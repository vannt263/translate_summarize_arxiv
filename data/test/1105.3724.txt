    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) has become in the past years an interesting candidate for a quantum description of the early universe via homogeneous cosmological models @xcite . based on the same quantization methods of loop quantum gravity @xcite , it has also become a testing ground for different conceptual and technical issues that arise in the full theory .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that the model was first fully understood is the spatially flat @xmath0=0 frw cosmological model coupled to the simplest kind of matter , namely a mass - less scalar field that serves as an internal time parameter @xcite .",
    "it was shown numerically that the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite , that connects an early contraction phase of the universe with the current state of expansion . by means of an exact solvable model , this bounce",
    "was then understood to be generic and present for all states of the theory , and the energy density was shown to be absolutely bounded by a critical density @xmath1 of the order of the planck density @xcite .",
    "it was then shown that semiclassical states after the bounce have to come from states that were also semiclassical well before the bounce @xcite .",
    "this results have also benefited from uniqueness results that warranties the physical consistency of the theory @xcite .",
    "the same quantization methods were applied to other isotropic models with and without a cosmological constant .",
    "thus , a closed @xmath0=1 was extensively studied in @xcite and @xcite , while the open @xmath0=-1 was considered in @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of singularity resolution for these models was recently completed in @xcite , extending previous results for the flat case @xcite . for the flat model , a cosmological constant",
    "was included in @xcite and a massive scalar field in @xcite , where singularity resolution was also shown to emerge as a feature of the theory .",
    "an extension of this consistent quantization method was successfully implemented for the simples",
    "anisotropic cosmology , namely a bianchi i spacetime in @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that , for anisotropic models with a nontrivial spatial curvature , this quantization method based on considering holonomies along closed loops was no longer applicable .",
    "the operator associated to the field strength was no longer well defined on the kinematical hilbert space of the theory used so far .",
    "the proposal put forward in @xcite was to consider _ open _ holonomies to represent the connection , and then define the curvature out of the resulting operator . as it turns out , this quantization method has some resemblance to the quantization procedure known as ` polymerization ' @xcite . for the quantization of bianchi ix cosmological models , it was also noted that this ` connection quantization ' could be successfully implemented @xcite , and the singularity could also be resolved .    a natural issue that one would like to investigate are the physical consequences of this ` new ' loop quantization .",
    "do we have the same qualitative behavior as in the holonomy based quantization ?",
    "this question has been satisfactorily ( but trivially ) answered in some cases where both quantizations are available .",
    "when the spatial curvature vanishes , as is the case of the @xmath0=0 frw and bianchi i models , both quantization methods coincide @xcite ( once one appropriately fixes a free parameter ) .",
    "it is then quite natural to ask whether the same feature is present in other models where the intrinsic spatial curvature in non - trivial .",
    "is there an important effect that the spatial curvature carries ? in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath0=1 frw model is unique to answer this question since , ( to our knowledge ) it is the only such model for which both loop quantizations exist .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore this issue in detail .",
    "more precisely , we shall develop the _ connection based _ quantum theory for a @xmath0=1 frw model and explore its more important features by using an effective description of the dynamics .",
    "we shall then compare this description with that from the standard holonomy based loop quantization explored in @xcite , where the effective description has been show to correctly capture the dynamics of semiclassical states @xcite .",
    "perhaps somewhat surprisingly , what we find is that in the new connection based quantum theory , the corresponding cyclic universe undergoes a series of bounces and recollapses , but now _ there are two different kind of bounces_. in the cosmic evolution , the universe alternates between these two bounces where both the density and minimum volume differ .",
    "interestingly , for universes that grow to become ` large ' before the expansion stops , the two bounces become more similar to each other , so that for a large universe like ours , they become almost indistinguishable .",

    ", we plot the time evolution of the volume @xmath18 ( left ) and the density @xmath81 ( right ) .",

    "( [ fig:2 ] ) we have plotted the time evolution of the universe for different values of the minimum volume at the bounce .",
    "as we can see , as we increase this value , and therefore , the field s momentum @xmath79 , the two bounces tend to each other , both in terms of the value of the volume and in the maximum value of the densities .",
    "note that the densities at the ` strongest ' bounce are much higher , in this regime , than in the holonomy - based quantization , and that they decrease as one increases the value of @xmath79 .",
    "one can further compare both description by fixing the value of @xmath79 and comparing the time evolution of volume and density .",
    "we have plotted such comparison in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3 ] ) for @xmath129 .",
    "note that the density at the bounce in the holonomy - based quantization is in between the two densities for the connection - based quantization .",
    "the period between the point of re - collapse is not the same for both schemes but , as one increases @xmath79 , they approach each other , just at the volume and density at the bounce converge .",
    "( left ) and the density @xmath81 ( right ) , for the two quantization methods , for @xmath129.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and the density @xmath81 ( right ) , for the two quantization methods , for @xmath129.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us summarize the results this section .",
    "first , we developed the quantum theory for @xmath0=1 loop quantum gravity coupled to a scalar field , employing a quantization method the uses open holonomies to regulate the field strength appearing in the constraint . in the second part we derived some of the consequences of such a quantum theory , by means of its effective description .",
    "we found that the most dramatic difference from the quantization previous explored is that the cyclic universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion , but alternating between two different quantum bounces ( or alternating between two kinds of points of re - collapse and a bounce ) .",
    "furthermore , we saw that for ` large universes ' , where the universe expands to a large volume ( in planck units ) , the densities ( and volumes ) of the two distinct bounces approach each other and converge to the values attained in the @xmath0=0 theory .",
    "in this article we have explored a quantization ambiguity that exists for certain models in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "this correspond to the freedom of using closed holonomies around loops to define curvature or open holonomies to define connections . since it is only the latter choice that is available for anisotropic models with non - trivial spatial curvature , it is important to understand the particular features of this quantization , and compare it to the original holonomy - based loop quantization . in this regard ,",
    "the isotropic @xmath0=1 frw model is ideal since both quantizations exist and are not equivalent ( while they are in the case of @xmath0=0 and bianchi i ) .",
    "we have explored some of the differences between these two theories , by means of their corresponding _ effective _ descriptions .",
    "the equation of motion for both theories are not the same , and therefore their underlying dynamics is different .",
    "the most dramatic difference is that , while the universe is cyclic in the holonomy - based quantization with a bounce followed by a re - collapse , in the new quantization the situation is more complicated , with three different turnaround points . in the semiclassical limit where the universe is a assumed to grow large ,",
    "we have seen that there are _ two _ kinds of bounces with different densities that alternate with the re - collapse .",
    "the volume at which the expansion stops and the universe starts to contract is also different .",
    "interestingly , in the limit of large universes both theories converge and the two distinct bounces of the connection - based theory approach that of the holonomy - based quantization . in this limit",
    "both descriptions approximate general relativity during the small density epochs of the cyclic universes , making them almost indistinguishable .",
    "it would be interesting to explore further the similarities and differences of the two approaches regarding singularity resolution , as was done in @xcite for the holonomy based description .",
    "further numerical analysis with various matter fields might yield significant differences that could have potential observable consequences .",
    "this shall be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank p. singh for discussions and comments , and e. montoya for discussions and for help with the figures .",

    "for a 3-sphere with radius equal to @xmath130 , the line element can be written as @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . with a simple redefinition of coordinates , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 ,",

    "let us now compute the holonomy along the edge @xmath144 with length @xmath145 , parameterized by @xmath146 , tangential to vector @xmath147 .",
