    "there has been a recent growth of interest in theories where some of the usual constants of nature are actually time- and/or space - varying quantities .",
    "most notably , the possibility of a time - varying fine - structure @xmath0 , has been the subject of a considerable amount of work , both at the theoretical and experimental / observational level .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the motivation comes from the recent work on the higher - dimensional theories @xcite , which are thought to be required to provide a consistent unification of the know fundamental interactions . in such theories the ` effective ' three - dimensional constants",
    "are typically related to the ` true ' higher - dimensional constants via the radii of the ( compact ) extra dimensions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", these radii often have a non - trivial evolution , naturally leading to the expectation of time ( or even space ) variations of the ` effective ' coupling constants we can measure @xcite .    there are a number of different ways in which a variation of @xmath0 can be modelled . from a ` theoretical ' point of view , the more convenient one appears to be to interpret it as a variation in the speed of light @xmath5 @xcite , but other alternatives have been explored @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to analyse the consequences of the variation of @xmath0 in a more phenomenological context , as was done in @xcite .    on the observational level ,",
    "the situation is at present somewhat confusing ",
    "see @xcite for a brief summary .",
    "the best limit from laboratory experiments ( using atomic clocks ) is @xcite @xmath6 measurements of isotope ratios in the oklo natural reactor provide the strongest geophysical constraints @xcite , @xmath7 although there are suggestions @xcite that due to a number of nuclear physics uncertainties and model dependencies a more realistic bound is @xmath8 .",
    "note that these measurements effectively probe timescales corresponding to a cosmological redshift of about @xmath9 ( compare with astrophysical measurements below ) .",
    "three kinds of astrophysical tests have been used .",
    "firstly , big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite can in principle provide rather strong constraints at very high redshifts , but it has a strong drawback in that one is always forced to make an assumption on how the neutron to proton mass difference depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this is needed to estimate the effect of a varying @xmath0 on the @xmath10 abundance .",
    "the abundances of the other light elements depend much less strongly on this assumption , but on the other hand these abundances are much less well known observationally .",
    "hence one can only find the relatively weak bound @xmath11    secondly , observations of the fine splitting of quasar doublet absorption lines probe smaller redshifts , but should be much more reliable . unfortunately , the two groups which have been actively studying this topic report different results .",
    "webb and collaborators @xcite were the first to report a positive result , @xmath12 note that this means that @xmath0 was _ smaller _ in the past .",
    "recently the same group reports two more ( as yet unpublished ) positive results @xcite , @xmath13 for redshifts @xmath14 and @xmath15 for redshifts @xmath16 . on the other hand , varshalovich and",
    "collaborators @xcite report only a null result , @xmath17 the first error bar corresponds to the statistical error while the second is the systematic one .",
    "this corresponds to the bound @xmath18 over a timescale of about @xmath19 years .",
    "it should be emphasised that the observational techniques used by both groups have significant differences , and it is presently not clear how the two compare when it comes to eliminating possible sources of systematic error .",
    "finally , a third option is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "this probes intermediate redshifts , but has the significant advantage that one has ( or will soon have ) highly accurate data .",
    "the reason why the cosmic microwave background is a good probe of variations of the fine - structure constant is that these alter the ionisation history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the dominant effect is a change in the redshift of recombination , due to a shift in the energy levels ( and , in particular , the binding energy ) of hydrogen .",
    "the thomson scattering cross - section is also changed for all particles , being proportional to @xmath20 . a smaller effect (",
    "which has so far been neglected ) is expected to come from a change in the helium abundance .",
    "as is well known , cmb fluctuations are typically described in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath21 from whose coefficients one defines @xmath22    increasing @xmath0 increases the redshift of last - scattering , which corresponds to a smaller sound horizon .",
    "since the position of the first doppler peak ( which we shall denote as @xmath23 ) is inversely proportional to the sound horizon at last scattering , we see that increasing @xmath0 will produce a larger @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this larger redshift of last scattering also has the additional effect of producing a larger early isw effect , and hence a larger amplitude of the first doppler peak @xcite .",
    "finally , an increase in @xmath0 decreases the high-@xmath3 diffusion damping ( which is essentially due to the finite thickness of the last - scattering surface ) , and thus increases the power on very small scales .",
    "the authors of @xcite provide an analysis of these effects and conclude that future cmb experiments should be able to provide constraints on a varying @xmath0 at the recombination epoch ( that is , at redshifts @xmath24 ) at the level of @xmath25 or equivalently @xmath26 which seems to indicate that these constraints can only become competitive in the near future .",
    "here we analyse these effects for the boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite data .",
    "we briefly review the method and then discuss the results in the next section .",
    "we find that this data tends to prefer a value of @xmath0 that was lower in the past .",
    "however , we strongly emphasise that there are interesting and so far unnoticed degeneracies in the physics of the problem which imply that this method of determining the fine - structure constant can only produce strong constraints if other cosmological parameters are independently known",
    ". we will comment on this point in section iii .",
    "while this paper was being finalised , another preprint appeared @xcite , containing an independent analysis of the same data .",
    "it should be noticed that there are some significant differences in the two analysis procedures , as well as in the results , which we will point out along the way . in the cases where a direct comparison is possible",
    ", our work confirms their results , while in the other cases we provide some physical motivation for the differences .",
    "we perform a likelihood analysis of the recently released boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite data , allowing for the possibility of a time - varying fine - structure constant .",
    "the method used follows the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum @xmath27 was obtained using a modified cmbfast algorithm which allows a varying @xmath0 parameter .",
    "we have changed the subroutine recfast @xcite according to the extensive description given in @xcite .",
    "we vary the power spectrum normalisation @xmath28 within the @xmath29 limits for the cobe 4-year data @xcite the space of model parameters spans @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and the @xmath27 normalisation @xmath34 note that @xmath35 is the value of the fine structure constant today .",
    "the basic grid of models was obtained considering parameter step sizes of 0.1 for @xmath4 ; 0.003 for @xmath36 ; 5 for @xmath2 ; 0.01 for @xmath37 and finally 0.01 for the @xmath38 . in order to compute the maxima and the confidence intervals for the 1-dim marginalised distributions",
    "we have increased the grid resolution of each of the model parameters using interpolation procedures .",
    "all our models have @xmath39 and no tilt .",
    "we point out that this is in agreement @xcite with the best - fit model for the @xmath39 case for the combined analysis of the boomerang and maxima data .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the authors of @xcite seem to find that the same data prefer tilted models even in the ` standard ' case , that is without considering a varying fine - structure constant .",
    "this will obviously affect their results , as we will discuss below .",
    "we also emphasise that @xmath0 may or may not have had a different value at the nucleosynthesis epoch , which in particular will affect the value of @xmath36 . since in the present paper",
    "we do not treat this effect , the correct approach @xcite is to accept the observationally determined value .",
    "this is the reason why we ignore excessively high values of @xmath36 which seem to be required by some analyses of the cmb data @xcite .    for each of these @xmath27 spectra",
    "we compute the flat band power estimates of the cmb anisotropies obtaining a simulated observation for each data point .",
    "these estimates cover the multi - pole range sampled by both boomerang and maxima experiments .",
    "the values of @xmath40 are obtained as _ function _ of @xmath2 in order to satisfy the range for @xmath36 defined above .",
    "interesting conclusions can be drawn by comparing the nominal calibration case for both experiments with the likelihood obtained after marginalising over the calibration uncertainties of boomerang ( @xmath41 ) and maxima ( @xmath42 ) . as mentioned in @xcite the fitting to a lower second doppler peak",
    "can be achieved either by increasing the value of @xmath36 or decreasing the value of @xmath37 .",
    "note also that there is an additional constraint on @xmath43 coming from the position of the main acoustic peak @xcite .",
    "we shall comment on the relative importance of the two constraints below .",
    "for the nominal calibration case we obtain a best fit model with @xmath44 @xmath45 in fig  [ nom_m ] we plot the marginalised distributions for all the parameters .    for this case the maxima and confidence intervals for the marginalised distributions",
    "are as follows ( all @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",
    "we then marginalised the 5-dim likelihood function over the calibration uncertainties assuming a gaussian prior . in this case",
    "we obtain a best fit model with @xmath52 @xmath53 in fig  [ cal_m ] we plot the marginalised distributions for all the parameters for the distribution marginalised over the calibration errors . comparing with fig  [ nom_m ]",
    "we notice that in the case of the marginalised distribution the distributions for @xmath4 and @xmath43 are slightly shifted towards lower values , while those of @xmath36 and @xmath2 are not significantly affected .",
    "the maxima and confidence intervals for the marginalised distributions are as follows ( again , all are @xmath46 ) : @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .    if we consider the best calibration case assuming a uniform prior we get the same best fit set of parameter values as for the calibration marginalised likelihood , apart from the bias ( which now has the value @xmath59 ) .",
    "the best calibration factor is 1.0 ( nominal ) for boomerang and 0.92 ( ratio with respect to the nominal case ) for maxima ( this corresponds to @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is just telling us that if we keep boomerang at the nominal calibration case and lower the height of the maxima data points we force the normalisation of the models to decrease .    if instead we consider the best calibration case assuming a gaussian prior we get a best fit with a calibration factor of 1.1 for boomerang and 1.0 ( nominal ) for maxima ( @xmath61 before weighting ) .",
    "as should be expected we get a higher best fit value for the models normalisation of @xmath62 .",
    "meanwhile for both cases we observe a decrease on the value of @xmath4 from 0.5 to 0.4 and on the value of @xmath63 from 0.94 to 0.93 , when compared with the nominal case .",
    "note that both pushing the boomerang data up or pushing the maxima data down provide for a better overlap of the two data sets .",
    "then the different overall normalisations ( in particular the height of the first doppler peak ) account for the different values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "in fig  [ 2dim_cal ] we plot the 2-dim likelihood functions obtained after marginalising over the remaining three parameters . in fig  [ 3d ]",
    "we plot the likelihood surface for @xmath2 and @xmath37 as well as for @xmath36 and @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , fig  [ 2dim_nom ] contains the corresponding likelihoods for the nominal calibration case .",
    "this highlights the fact that there are some non - trivial degeneracies in the problem @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this point below .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the case where no variation of the fine structure constant is allowed . for that purpose",
    "we considered the conditional distribution for @xmath64 to obtain a best fit model with @xmath65 @xmath66    in fig  [ 2dimcal_c ] we plot this distribution marginalised over @xmath4 and the bias .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath0 seems to force a higher best fit value of @xmath2 and of @xmath36 and a lower value of @xmath4 with a best fit cobe normalised model .",
    "again , this is consistent with @xcite ( which also find a tilt @xmath67 , while @xcite find @xmath68 ) .",
    "if we instead condition our distribution to a value of @xmath69 we get a best fit model with @xmath70 @xmath71 this result emphasises the rather obvious point that reducing the value of @xmath36 requires a lower value of @xmath37 to account for a low second acoustic peak .    once more , we emphasise that the values of @xmath40 are obtained as function of @xmath2 in order to satisfy the range for @xmath36 defined above .",
    "this means that we should expect to observe some correlation when plotting @xmath2 against @xmath36 .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by fig  [ 2dim_cal ] .",
    "therefore we have so far confirmed the fact that to fit a low second doppler peak we need a high baryonic content @xcite and a lower fine structure constant in the past .",
    "however , an important question still remains : what s the weight of the second acoustic peak relative to the main peak in drawing the above conclusions ?",
    "we recall that in @xcite it was shown that the position of the first doppler peak can by itself provide a constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "can it happen that the main acoustic peak is still a heavy factor in determining the above best fit parameters ?      in order to answer this important question , we considered the set of data points sampling the multi - pole region to up @xmath72 .",
    "hence this data set consists now on the first 8 boomerang and the first 5 maxima data points with the nominal calibration ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we then repeat the likelihood analysis for this new data set .",
    "we obtain a best fit model with @xmath74 @xmath75    this is rather encouraging , particularly because the best - fit value for @xmath36 is precisely the one found by observations .",
    "however , the maxima and confidence intervals for the marginalised distributions are as follows ( again , all are @xmath46 ) : @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    we conclude that most of the best fit model parameters do not lay within the @xmath81 range around the maximum of the marginalised distribution for the corresponding parameter .",
    "therefore the 5-dim likelihood must have a narrow peak around this best model with an enlarged surface around the remaining values which height is not significantly smaller then the absolute peak .",
    "in fig  [ dp_nom_m ] we plot the marginalised distributions for all the parameters , while in fig  [ 2dim_dp_nom ] we plot the 2-dim likelihood functions obtained after marginalising over the remaining three parameters .    comparing fig  [ dp_nom_m ] with fig  [ nom_m ]",
    "we immediately notice a number of extremely interesting points .",
    "firstly , even though the dataset for the first doppler peak favours a smaller @xmath0 in the past , there is a non - negligible likelihood for _ larger _ values as well .",
    "the inclusion of information from the second doppler peak all but eliminates this possibility ( compare this with fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the full dataset _ increases _ the preferred values of @xmath36 ( or more accurately , decreases the probability for low values ) . and",
    "thirdly , data from the first doppler peak alone is basically insensitive to @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( recall that all our models have @xmath39 ) , while the full dataset tends to favour low values of @xmath2 and also narrows the distribution for @xmath4 around a value of @xmath82 ( and most notably reduces the probability of lower values such as @xmath83 which would be allowed by the reduced dataset ) .",
    "this might explain the differences in the contour plots of the 2-dim distribution of ( @xmath63 , @xmath4 ) in fig  [ 2dim_dp_nom ] and fig  [ 2dim_nom ] ; the plot in fig  [ 2dim_dp_nom ] shows a correlation between ( @xmath63 , @xmath4 ) which disappears when including the other doppler peaks .",
    "these 2-dim plots do also indicate correlations between ( @xmath63 , @xmath2 ) ; ( @xmath63,@xmath36 ) and ( @xmath63,bias ) which do exist in both situations .",
    "finally , we also consider the case with no variation of the fine structure constant allowed for the reduced dataset .",
    "we obtain a best fit model with @xmath84 @xmath85    if now we condition our distribution to a value of @xmath69 we get a best fit model with @xmath86 @xmath87    in fig  [ 2dimdp_nom_c ] we plot these conditional distributions marginalised over @xmath4 and the bias .",
    "in this paper we have performed a likelihood analysis of the combined boomerang and maxima datasets , allowing for the possibility of a time - varying fine - structure constant , for which there is further observational evidence elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the intuitively obvious expectation that this data prefers a value of @xmath0 that was smaller in the past by a few per cent .",
    "however , we wish to emphasise that this is not the same as saying that the cmb can readily provide and unambiguous measurement of the fine - structure constant . as we hopefully made clear above , there are some interesting degeneracies in the problem which imply that other cosmological parameters could still fairly easily mimic a varying @xmath0 .",
    "hence this method of measurement of @xmath0 is still far from being ` competitive ' , in the sense that statements about @xmath0 will not be possible until independent accurate determinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( and possibly other parameters ) are available .",
    "we have also shown that the main reason behind the preferred lower value of @xmath0 in the present dataset still comes mainly from the data points around the first doppler peak .",
    "the main effect of the high-@xmath3 data points is to increase the preferred value for @xmath1 and eliminate the possibility of a larger fine - structure constant in the past .",
    "a secondary ( from this perspective ) effect of the small angular scale data is to tighten the constraints on other parameters .",
    "furthermore , we believe that this relative dominance of the low-@xmath3 measurements will remain even in the post - map era .    we thank bruce bassett , pedro ferreira , joo magueijo , anupam mazumdar and paul shellard for useful discussions and comments .",
