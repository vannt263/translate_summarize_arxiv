    "everyone is familiar with dominoes and has used them for fun .",
    "a common game is to arrange the dominoes in a row and give a push to the first .",
    "this generates a pleasing wave of falling dominoes .",
    "the propagation happens at some speed @xmath0 ( not necessarily constant ) . a qualitative discussion for general audiences is given by walker in @xcite .",
    "given the game s simplicity it is perhaps surprising to discover that an exact computation of the speed @xmath0 is quite difficult .",
    "daykin realized this in the following 1971 proposal @xcite to the readers of the :     how fast do dominoes fall ? \" + the  domino theory of southeast asia \" says that if vietnam falls , then laos falls , then cambodia falls , and so on .",
    "hearing a discussion of the theory led me to wonder about the proposed physical problem .",
    "the reader is invited to set his or her own  reasonable \" simplifying assumptions , such as perfectly elastic dominoes , constant coefficient of friction between dominoes and the table , and initial configuration with the dominoes equally spaced in a straight line , and so on .    in 1983 , mclachlan et al .",
    "@xcite found a scaling law for the speed @xmath0 in the limiting case of dominoes with zero thickness equally spaced in a straight line . with these assumptions",
    "the authors found the functional relation v = g ( d .",
    "[ eq:1 ] here @xmath1 is the height of the dominoes , @xmath2 the spacing between dominoes , and @xmath3 an undetermined function of @xmath4 .",
    "this relation followed from dimensional analysis of the problem .",
    "mclachlan et al . proceeded to test the formula experimentally using dominoes of heights @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , banks presented a simplified description of the effect @xcite .",
    "his analysis , among other assumptions , assumes a uniform propagation speed and conservation of momentum .",
    "a different direction was taken by shaw in a short paper @xcite describing how to model the domino effect as a computer simulation and use it as an experiment in the undergraduate physics lab .",
    "equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is not an entirely satisfactory solution , of course , containing as it does an unknown function .",
    "this recognition became the motivation for the present article . in this work",
    "we develop an expression for the speed @xmath0 .",
    "the result can be cast as a particular forms of the scaling function @xmath7 arising from a particular set of assumptions .    in order to highlight the basic physics behind the problem",
    ", we replace the dominoes by massless rods topped with point masses @xmath8 , as seen in figure [ fig : pin - chain ] . a similar analysis in the case of dominoes with the shape of parallelepipeds is straightforward ,",

    "we shall assume that :    1 .",
    "_ the chain of rods is uniform_. this means that all rods are identical and are equally spaced along a straight line .",
    "let @xmath1 be the length of a rod and @xmath8 the mass on top .",
    "the collisions are head - on_. this means that , seen from above , all the rods are and remain aligned on the same line .",
    "if this is not the case , then additional parameters are necessary to describe the collisions from point to point .",
    "the higher the asymmetry , the more parameters are needed , and the problem becomes highly complicated .",
    "there is _ enough static friction _ between the rods and the floor to keep the rods from sliding relative to the floor .",
    "thus the rods pivot about fixed axes .",
    "no energy is dissipated at the contact point _ between the rods and the floor .",
    "this condition is independent of the previous one ; it is possible for an object to rotate about an axis and yet to dissipate energy .",
    "_ collisions are instantaneous_. this means that the time interval @xmath9 during which a collision occurs is zero .",
    "the change in total angular momentum is then @xmath10 .",
    "that is , total angular momentum is conserved during the collision , even though gravity is an external force and produces a non - zero torque .",
    "the collisions are elastic_. this means that energy is not dissipated during the collisions .",
    "the rods are stiff_. this means that there is no deformation of the rods and thus no energy is converted to elastic potential energy of deformation .",
    "this condition is independent of the previous one ; it is possible for the rods to be stiff and still dissipate energy during a collision .      to facilitate the calculations in the next section we present our notation in advance .",
    "we label the rods sequentially with the numbers @xmath11 starting with 1 from the left end .",
    "we also label @xmath12 the pivot points of the rods as seen in figure [ fig : pin - chain ] .",

    "since @xmath44 it follows that @xmath49 and therefore @xmath50 thus deep into the chain we find translational invariance : the initial angular velocity imparted to a rod by its neighbor becomes independent of position .",
    "notice that in this limit the initial push given to the first rod becomes irrelevant .",
    "we can obtain the limiting speed of the wave by computing the time between collisions , working well into the chain where this becomes independent of position .",
    "apply conservation of energy for the @xmath51 rod as it begins moving and after it falls through an arbitrary angle @xmath52 .",

    "the scaling function @xmath7 is plotted in figure [ fig : graph ] .",
    ".,width=302 ]    no simple closed expression exists for complete elliptic integrals , but some insight into our solution comes from looking at the limit of very closely spaced rods ( @xmath77 ) . in this limit @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "using these in the above expression yields @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 from this we find @xmath82 thus the wave in very closely spaced rods moves very fast .    in a similar way one can examine the other extreme geometrical limit , @xmath76 slightly smaller than unity",
    ". put @xmath83 . then @xmath84 while @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for @xmath74",
    "very near unity the complete elliptic integral is approximately @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xcite . here",
    "this gives @xmath89 , which diverges as @xmath90 approaches zero .",
    "however in this limit @xmath91 is finite : @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 using the above approximations yields @xmath94 or @xmath95 , where @xmath96 as @xmath76 increases to 1 .",
    "thus as @xmath2 gets very close to @xmath1 the wave speed drops to zero . physically this occurs because one rod gives a very small push to the next in line , which as a result takes a very long time to fall .",
    "the reader might wish to conduct a quick experiment to verify this conclusion or a more careful one to compare our theoretical results with experiment .",
    "of course , the reader has noticed the consistency of our results with that of mclachlan et al .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a set of assumptions for the propagation of the domino wave and we have computed the corresponding limiting speed . for simplicity",
    "we have presented the solution for a simplified geometry .",
    "however , the reader can easily transfer the solution to the case of dominoes with the shape of parallelepipeds  with appropriate adjustments of course .",
    "we thank the referees for bringing to our attention the articles of walker @xcite and shaw @xcite , and the book of banks @xcite .",
    "after this work was completed a paper @xcite with somewhat similar analysis appeared on the cornell archives .",
    "consider a sequence @xmath97 , with the recurrence relation @xmath98 this is known as a mixed progression .",
    "we want to express @xmath99 in terms of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath24 .",
    "multiply both sides by @xmath102 and sum from @xmath103 to @xmath63 ( with @xmath104 ) : @xmath105 in the first term on the right - hand side replace @xmath74 by @xmath106 and in the second replace @xmath74 by @xmath107 .",
    "this yields @xmath108 the first two sums have nearly all terms in common ( all but the @xmath51 on the left and the first on the right ) .",
    "cancelling the terms in common and evaluating the third sum yields the desired solution : @xmath109",
    "the elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite is defined by @xmath110 when @xmath111 this is called the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , denoted by @xmath58 : @xmath112    the integral @xmath113 can be expressed in terms of the elliptic integral of the first kind as follows .",
