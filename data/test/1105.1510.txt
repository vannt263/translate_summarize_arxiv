    "gauge theories constitute the building blocks of our present understanding of natural phenomena .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of high energy particle interactions is , in fact , entirely based on a semi - simple gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "the sm accounts for roughly four percent of the known universe .",
    "however , several puzzles remain still unexplained .",
    "for example , why do we observe , at least , three generations of elementary particles . besides , the remaining @xmath1 of the universe , of which @xmath2 dark matter , and @xmath3 dark energy , remains largely unknown .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that new gauge theories , or extensions of the present ones play a fundamental role in explaining the unknown side of the universe .",
    "the space of four dimensional gauge theories at our disposal , without theoretical prejudice , is very large and moreover a large fraction of it is still _ terra incognita _ due to our limited methods to tackle nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "a fascinating possibility is that different gauge theories display the same physical dynamics .",
    "this is possible since the physical quantities are determined by the gauge singlet operators of a generic gauge theory .",
    "therefore it is perfectly legal to imagine to have two different gauge theories leading to the same physics , at least , in certain regimes .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) itself is a famous example .",
    "in fact , at low energy the spectrum can be represented by hadrons interacting via yukawa interactions and its electric dual description is in terms of the @xmath4 gauge theory featuring quarks and gluons .",
    "it is therefore natural to imagine that generic asymptotically free gauge theories have magnetic duals .",
    "in fact , in the late nineties , in a series of ground breaking papers seiberg @xcite provided strong support for the existence of a consistent picture of such a duality within a supersymmetric framework .",
    "supersymmetry is , however , quite special and the existence of such a duality does not automatically imply the existence of nonsupersymmetric duals .",
    "one of the most relevant results put forward by seiberg has been the identification of the boundary of the conformal window for supersymmetric qcd as a function of the number of flavors and colors .",
    "recently several analytic predictions have been provided for the conformal window of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories using different approaches @xcite .",
    "we initiated in @xcite the exploration of the possible existence of a qcd nonsupersymmetric gauge dual providing a consistent picture of the phase diagram as a function of number of colors and flavors .",
    "arguably the existence of a possible dual of a generic nonsupersymmetric asymptotically free gauge theory able to reproduce its infrared dynamics must match the t hooft anomaly conditions @xcite .",
    "we have exhibited several solutions of these conditions for qcd in @xcite .",
    "an earlier exploration already appeared in @xcite . in @xcite theories with fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations were analyzed .    in @xcite",
    "we have put the idea of nonsupersymmetric gauge duality on a firmer ground by showing that for certain scalarless gauge theories with a spectrum similar to the one of qcd the gauge dual passes a large number of consistency checks .",
    "the theory studied in @xcite is qcd with @xmath5 dirac flavors and one adjoint weyl fermion .",
    "an important feature of this theory is that it possesses the same global symmetry of super qcd despite the fact that squarks are absent .",
    "this means that there are four extra anomaly constraints not present in the case of ordinary qcd , moreover we have shown that the potential dual can be constructed for any number of colors greater than two .",
    "the magnetic dual is a new gauge theory featuring magnetic quarks and a weyl adjoint fermion , new gauge singlet fermions which can be identified as states composite of the electric variables , as well as scalar states needed to mediate the interactions between the magnetic quarks and the gauge singlet fermions .",
    "the new scalars allow for a consistent flavor decoupling which was an important consistency check in the case of supersymmetry .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that the candidate dual allows to bound the anomalous dimension of the dirac fermion mass operator to be less than one in the conformal window , and there we also estimated the critical number of flavors below which large distance conformality is lost in the electric variables .    in these previous studies we implicitly assumed that there exist nontrivial infrared fixed points in the magnetic description matching the electric ones .",
    "however , given that we do not start in the ultraviolet with a supersymmetric spectrum nor we impose supersymmetric coupling relations it is legitimate to ask whether these fixed point exist at all in the magnetic description , and if they do what are their universal properties .",
    "the goal of this work is exactly to establish the existence of these fixed points assuming the most general coupling structure .",
    "we will investigate the regime where the computations are trustable , i.e. when the magnetic theory features fixed points accessible in perturbation theory .",
    "we discover , for the first time , a large number of calculable fixed points and classify them by analyzing their basin of attraction .",
    "an extremely interesting result , according to us , is that among these very many fixed points we discover supersymmetric fixed points to emerge in the infrared along nonsupersymmetric flows .",
    "our results have an impact on the ( non)supersymmetric gauge - gauge duality and even recent ideas on why the sm can be seen as the magnetic dual description of an electric strongly coupled theory featuring no scalars @xcite .",
    "the consequences of this interpretation of the sm leads to a novel way to tackle the hierarchy problem and even to shed light on the mystery of the observed number of matter generations @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological interest of our studies relies also on the fact that theories similar to the ones investigated here and featuring infrared fixed points have been used to construct sensible extensions of the standard model of particle interactions of technicolor type passing precision data and known as minimal walking technicolor models @xcite .",
    "duality has also been used to infer relevant insights on the constraints on these models from precision electroweak tests @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we investigated the possible existence of a magnetic dual for the electric theory constituted by a scalarless @xmath6 gauge theory with @xmath5 dirac fermions and @xmath7 larger than two , as in qcd , but with an extra weyl fermion transforming according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the quantum global symmetry of the electric theory is therefore : @xmath8 at the classical level there is one more @xmath9 symmetry destroyed by quantum corrections due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly . of the three independent @xmath10 symmetries only two survive , a vector like @xmath11 and an axial - like anomaly free ( af )",
