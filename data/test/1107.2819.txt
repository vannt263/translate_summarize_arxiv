    "for almost a century now after its discovery , the schwarzschild solution describing a static , spherically symmetric vacuum spacetime in einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) has been a valuable tool for a wealth of theoretical and experimental studies , including in particular weak - field tests of the theory . for more than half a century ,",
    "the validity of the solution beyond the schwarzschild radius @xmath0 and the consequent existence of bhs was thought to be a mathematical artifact of the field equations .",
    "this picture has changed dramatically in more recent decades .",
    "crucial events in this sense were the mathematical discovery of the kerr solution describing rotating bhs @xcite , and the astrophysical x - ray and radio observations in the 1960s and 1970s .",
    "cosmic x - ray sources , first detected in 1963 @xcite , were soon associated with compact stellar objects and , in particular , with mass exchange from an ordinary star onto a compact object in binary systems @xcite .",
    "this interpretation received further support when the x - ray source cyg x-1 was identified with the supergiant boib star hd  226868 @xcite , which established cyg x-1 as the first observed x - ray binary . over the next few years ,",
    "the explanation of these systems in terms of accretion onto compact stellar objects in binary systems became widely accepted ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "measurements of the binary period and radial velocity provide lower limits on the mass of the compact companion .",
    "the values obtained for some x - ray binaries comfortably exceed the upper mass limit of about @xmath1 for neutron stars .",
    "recent investigations of cyg x-1 , for example , predict @xmath2 for the compact member @xcite . also starting in the early 1960s , optical and radio observations identified `` star like '' objects with surprisingly large redshifts @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as cosmological in origin , the redshifts implied enormous distances and , accordingly , luminosities . over the next decade",
    "the cosmological origin of these `` quasi - stellar '' sources ( or quasars ) became clear , and accretion onto supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) @xcite was accepted as the most plausible explanation of their energetics @xcite . by",
    "now , observations of stellar dynamics near the centers of galaxies and iron k@xmath3 emission line profiles provide strong evidence that many galaxies harbor bhs at their centers @xcite .",
    "bh masses are generally closely correlated to the bulge velocity dispersion and luminosity @xcite . for the milky way",
    ", astrometric and radial velocity observations of short - period stars orbiting the galactic center @xcite predict an unseen gravitational mass of @xmath4 .",
    "electromagnetic observations provide strong but _ indirect _ evidence for the existence of astrophysical bhs .",
    "a more direct way of probing the bh nature of astrophysical compact objects is offered by the newly emerging field of gw astronomy .",
    "first - generation ground - based laser - interferometric detectors ( such as ligo , virgo and geo600 ) have reached design sensitivity , and advanced versions of these detectors will be operational within a few years @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent sources of detectable gws for these detectors is the inspiral and coalescence of stellar mass and , possibly , intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) binaries . at lower frequencies , space - based laser interferometric observations",
    "@xcite have the potential to complement ground - based efforts with high signal - to - noise ratio observations of massive bh binaries .",
    "space - based detectors are guaranteed to observe galactic binaries containing white dwarfs and/or neutron stars , and they may also detect the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive bhs . due to the weak interaction of gws with any type of matter , including the detectors , digging physical signals from the noisy data stream represents a daunting task and heavily relies on so - called _ matched filtering _",
    "techniques @xcite .",
    "matched filtering is a common choice to search for signals of known form in noisy data , and works by cross - correlating the actual `` signal '' ( i.e. , the detector s output ) with a set of theoretical templates .",
    "accurate modeling of the gw sources thus plays a vital role in maximizing the scientific output from these experimental efforts .    event rate estimates for imbhs and stellar - mass bh binaries are very uncertain , but advanced earth - based detectors are expected to observe several events per year ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "_ noted that recent metallicity measurements require revisions in the population synthesis models used for event rate estimates , suggesting that stellar - mass bh - bh binaries may be the first gw sources to be detected @xcite .",
    "the observations of two possible x - ray binary precursors of bh - bh binaries provide a much needed observational constraint on compact binaries containing at least one bh , suggesting again that bh - bh binary mergers may be more common than anticipated @xcite .",
    "population synthesis models have large uncertainties , related e.g. to the poorly known common envelope phase , and some models would necessarily be ruled out if advanced ligo does _ not _ detect bh binaries . in this sense , gw detectors are _ guaranteed _ to put constraints on compact binary formation in the near future .",
    "schutz @xcite also pointed out that coherent data analysis using three or more detectors may further increase event rates by factors of a few , making prospects of doing astrophysics with earth - based detectors even brighter .",
    "estimates for event rates of smbh binaries detectable by space - based interferometers range from @xmath5 to @xmath6s per year , with a most likely estimate of @xmath7 @xcite .    over the past decade , bh modeling has also attracted a great deal of interest in the context of high - energy physics . according to the gauge / gravity duality , gravitational physics in anti",
    "- de sitter ( ads ) backgrounds describes field theories on the boundary of that spacetime @xcite . according to this duality , bhs in ads",
    "are dual to an equilibrium field theory , and therefore interacting bhs or bhs off - equilibrium may represent interesting physics from the dual point of view .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence that some of the physics behind quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions is captured by this duality , which on the gravitational side corresponds to shock wave collisions and bh formation in ads @xcite .",
    "understanding bh spacetimes is also of interest for high - energy physics in connection with extra - dimensional scenarios .",
    "solutions to the hierarchy problem in physics have been developed where all standard - model interactions are confined to a 3 + 1 dimensional brane embedded in a spacetime with large extra dimensions or an extra dimension with a warp factor @xcite . in these models gravity",
    "propagates in the entire higher - dimensional spacetime ( the `` bulk '' ) , and the fundamental planck scale could be as low as @xmath8 .",
    "these energy scales are accessible to experiments such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "if the fundamental planck scale is so low , thorne s hoop conjecture suggests the exciting possibility of bh production in high - energy parton - parton collisions @xcite , i.e.  a direct observable signature of the existence of extra - dimensions .",
    "accurate modeling of energy and momentum losses in the form of gws during the collisions and determination of the bh formation cross section will be crucial for the analysis of data from such experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and they should be amenable to classical calculations in @xmath9-dimensional gr @xcite .    finally , the understanding of bh dynamics under extreme conditions is fascinating from a mathematical - physics point of view .",
    "questions such as bh stability , cosmic censorship , etcetera can only be addressed by solving the full nonlinear set of the field equations .    for many of these scenarios ,",
    "it is convenient to divide the coalescence of a bh binary in the framework of gr into three stages which mirror the different tools used for their modeling : ( i ) the inspiral phase , where the interaction between the individual holes is still sufficiently weak to justify the use of post - newtonian ( pn ) techniques @xcite ; ( ii ) the final orbits , plunge and merger , which are governed by the strong - field regime of einstein s equations and can be described only by fully numerical simulations ; ( iii ) the ringdown of the remnant bh , which is amenable to a perturbative treatment @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will focus on the second , strong - field stage , on the numerical tools dedicated to its study , and results obtained following the 2005 breakthroughs @xcite . as we shall see , however , a comprehensive understanding of bh dynamics requires a close interplay of numerical and analytical studies , and we will discuss in various cases the interface between numerical relativity and approximation techniques .    following a brief summary of the framework employed in numerical relativity ( sec .",

    "sec : highenergy ] we will restrict our discussion to @xmath16 , i.e. three spatial and one time dimension .",
    "the metric is determined by the einstein equations @xmath17 with @xmath18 in vacuum . while analytic solutions ( as , for example , the schwarzschild and kerr solutions and the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker solution ) have been found for systems with high symmetry , solutions for dynamical configurations without special symmetries generally require the use of numerical tools . for this purpose",
    "the einstein equations need to be cast as an _ initial value formulation _ such that the cauchy - kowalewski theorem guarantees a uniquely determined evolution of appropriately chosen initial data . in the case of einstein s equations",
    ", it is not obvious that such a formulation can be obtained : a straightforward calculation shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) contains second time derivatives of the metric components @xmath19 , but not of @xmath20 .",
    "this fact mirrors the coordinate or gauge freedom characteristic of gr , and implies the existence of so - called _ constraint _ equations which impose conditions on the metric components and their first derivatives on each spatial slice with constant coordinate time @xmath21 . in the following",
    "we will discuss two approaches which provide an initial value formulation of the einstein equations and have led to successful , long - term stable numerical evolutions : the generalized harmonic ( gh ) formulation employed in pretorius breakthrough bh binary simulations @xcite and the canonical arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) split @xcite , reformulated by york @xcite , which forms the starting point for the _ moving puncture _",
    "breakthroughs @xcite .    * _ adm 3 + 1 split : _ * spacetime is decomposed into a one - parameter family of three - dimensional spatial slices .",
    "we choose coordinates adapted to this formulation , such that the coordinate time @xmath21 labels each slice and @xmath22 denotes points on the slice . on each hypersurface",
    ", there exists a unique timelike , future pointing unit normal field @xmath23 which defines a projection operator @xmath24 onto the hypersurface .",
    "the geometry of the hypersurface is completely determined by the _ three - metric _ or _ first fundamental form _",
    "the coordinate freedom is represented by the shift vector @xmath26 and the lapse function @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) , which relate spatial coordinates on ( and measure separation in proper time between ) different hypersurfaces .",
    "the projections @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 of the einstein equations then lead to six evolution equations for the three - metric @xmath32 , three momentum constraints and the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the ricci tensor , ricci scalar and covariant derivative associated with the three - metric , and the extrinsic curvature @xmath37 has been introduced to obtain a first - order system in time .",
    "it turns out that this formulation of the einstein equations is only _ weakly hyperbolic _",
    "@xcite , and therefore not suitable for long - term stable numerical evolutions . motivated by these stability problems , several modifications of the adm system have been investigated .",
    "the most popular is the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation @xcite , which rearranges the degrees of freedom via a split of the extrinsic curvature into trace and trace - free parts , a conformal transformation and promotion of the contracted conformal christoffel symbols to the status of independent variables : @xmath38 the resulting set of evolution and constraint equations is given in eqs .",
    "( 15)-(30 ) of @xcite .",
    "subject to minor modifications , such as replacing the conformal factor by @xmath39 or adding the auxiliary constraint arising from the definition of @xmath40 in eq .",

    "these coordinates have played an important role in the analysis of the cauchy problem in gr @xcite . in harmonic coordinates ,",
    "the einstein equations take on a manifestly hyperbolic form , which allows for a generalization to arbitrary coordinate or gauge choices @xcite .",
    "the first step is to introduce four arbitrary source functions @xmath44 such that the coordinates obey @xmath45 and treat these functions as independent evolution variables .",

    "* _ initial data : _ * the construction of initial data requires solving the hamiltonian and momentum constraints . here",
    "we only summarize the key concepts ; we refer the reader to cook s review article @xcite for details .",
    "most work on the construction of initial data is based on the york - lichnerowicz split @xcite , which involves a conformal transformation of metric and extrinsic curvature and separates the latter into trace and trace - free part .",
    "more recently , the _ thin - sandwich _",
    "construction @xcite , which replaces the extrinsic curvature by the time derivative of the metric , has become a popular alternative . in either case , the resulting elliptic equations simplify substantially under the assumption of conformal flatness and a spatially constant @xmath58 .",
    "while this formalism provides a convenient method to solve the constraint equations , we still need to ensure that the initial data represent a physically realistic system , typically two bhs with specific spins and momenta .",
    "this can be achieved by generalizing the schwarzschild solution , which is obtained in the above framework in conformally flat form with conformal factor @xmath59 .",
    "a generalization to initial data of @xmath60 bhs starting from rest is directly obtained by the construction of misner @xcite or brill and lindquist @xcite .",
    "remarkably , an analytic solution for the extrinsic curvature can still be obtained for bhs with initial linear momenta @xmath61 and spins @xmath62 @xcite . by applying a compactification to the internal asymptotically flat region ,",

    "@xcite generated initial data based on a generalization of the kerr - schild solution @xcite and were thus able to evolve a bh binary with spin magnitude 0.95 .",
    "in alternative to generalizing analytically known bh solutions , the presence of horizons in the initial data can be encoded in the form of boundary conditions for the metric and extrinsic curvature @xcite as determined by the isolated horizon framework @xcite .",
    "initial data along these lines have been constructed in @xcite , and form the starting point of most of the numerical evolutions using the gh system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    * _ diagnostics : _ * extracting physical information from numerical simulations of the einstein equations is nontrivial for two reasons . first , the evolved variables are dependent on the coordinate conditions ; second , it is often not possible to define local quantities familiar from newtonian physics .",
    "the first difficulty requires the calculation of gauge - independent variables .",
    "the second difficulty is alleviated by the _",
    "isolated horizon _",
    "framework @xcite , which facilitates the calculation of bh mass and spin in the limit of isolated bhs ; in practice , this framework is often applied when the bhs are farther apart and their interaction is considered negligible .",
    "local properties of the bhs are encoded in their apparent horizon @xcite . in particular , the irreducible mass can be expressed in terms of the apparent horizon area : @xmath64 . in the limit of an isolated bh , the spin can be derived from the integration of the rotational killing vectors over the horizon according to eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite .",
    "in practice it has been found that using _ flat - space _ rotational killing vectors yields reasonable results @xcite , but we also note the improved method to compute approximations to killing vectors in @xcite and an alternative method @xcite based on weyl scalars to compute quasi - local bh quantities without solving the killing equation .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , however , the approximate nature of any spin calculation in bh binary simulations .    in comparison , it is more straightforward to extract global quantities of the spacetime , most notably the total mass - energy @xmath65 and the linear and angular momentum @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xcite .",

    "this results in systematic errors , due to ambiguities in the tetrad choice and the neglect of gw backscattering .",
    "while these errors can be reduced by extracting gws at a sequence of radii and extrapolating to infinite radius ( @xmath68 asymptotically falls off @xmath72 @xcite ) , a cleaner method is to calculate @xmath68 at infinity as provided by _",

    "alternatively , gws can be extracted by viewing the metric in the far field regime as a perturbation of the schwarzschild spacetime and employing the formalism of regge , wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite .",
    "one thus obtains the regge - wheeler - moncrief and zerilli - moncrief master functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , which can be converted into the multipolar components of the gw strain @xmath77 according to eq .",

    "extrinsic parameters such as sky position , distance , orbital inclination angle , arrival time and initial phase of the wave , in contrast , depend on the source location relative to the observer , and do not directly enter the gw source modeling process .",

    "bh binaries with spins @xmath87 have been evolved in @xcite , but exceeding an apparent barrier of @xmath88 @xcite requires departure from the conformal flatness assumption @xcite .",
    "the present maximum is @xmath89 for aligned spins evolved for 12.5 orbits by lovelace _",
    "finally , we note that emission of gws efficiently circularizes bh binary orbits @xcite .",
    "bh binaries are therefore expected to have vanishing eccentricity by the time they enter the frequency window of ground - based detectors , and for this reason most work on gw source modeling has focused on the quasi - circular limit .",

    "we shall further see below that the gravitational recoil imparted upon the remnants of coalescing binaries strongly depends on spins and mass ratio .",

    "the resulting estimates are all , to some extent , model - dependent , but frequently yield moderate values @xmath150 and , for some cases , values close to the kerr limit @xmath151 ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",

    "in contrast with the case of stellar - mass bhs , there is by now some observational evidence for smbh binaries @xcite .",

    "as in the case of bh spins , the observations imply that numerical relativity needs to cover a wide range in @xmath85 .",

    "thus , high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , may directly probe strongly coupled gravitational physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , such tests may even be routinely available in the collisions of ultra high - energy cosmic rays with the earth s atmosphere @xcite , or in astrophysical bh environments @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the production of bhs at trans - planckian collision energies ( compared to the fundamental planck scale ) should be well described by using classical gr extended to @xmath9  dimensions @xcite .",
    "the challenge is then to use the classical framework to determine the cross section for production and , for each initial setup , the fractions of the collision energy and angular momentum that are lost in the higher - dimensional space by gw emission .",
    "this information will be of paramount importance to improve the modelling of microscopic bh production in event generators .",
    "the first models for bh production in parton - parton collisions used a simple black disk approach to estimate the cross section for production @xcite .",
    "as we already described , only recently exact results for highly relativistic collisions where obtained in four dimensions , using numerical relativity techniques @xcite .",
    "the extension to higher - dimensional spacetimes is a topic of current investigations @xcite .",
    "the first numerical results concerning low - energy collisions have been reported last year @xcite , initial data for boosted bh binaries have been constructed using an extended puncture approach in @xcite and some results for high - energy collisions have been presented in @xcite .    * _ ads / cft and holography . _ * in 199798 , a powerful new technique known as the ads / cft correspondence or , more generally , the gauge - gravity duality , was introduced and rapidly developed @xcite .",
    "this holographic correspondence provides an effective description of a nonperturbative , strongly coupled regime of certain gauge theories in terms of higher - dimensional classical gravity in ads backgrounds .",
    "in particular , equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of strongly coupled thermal gauge theories are related to the physics of higher - dimensional bhs , black branes and their fluctuations .",
    "these studies revealed intriguing connections between the dynamics of bh horizons and hydrodynamics , and offer new perspectives on notoriously difficult problems , such as the bh information loss paradox , the nature of bh singularities and quantum gravity .",
    "numerical relativity in anti - de sitter backgrounds is bound to contribute enormously to our understanding of the gauge - gravity duality and is likely to have important applications in the interpretation of observations @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the context of the gauge - gravity duality , high - energy collisions of bhs have a dual description in terms of _ a ) _  high - energy collisions with balls of deconfined plasma surrounded by a confining phase , and _",
    "b ) _  the rapid localized heating of a deconfined plasma .",
    "these are the type of events that may have direct observational consequences for the experiments at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "numerical relativity in anti - de sitter is particularly difficult , and so far only very special situations have been handled @xcite . among these",
    ", we note the recent numerical proof that pure ads space is unstable against collapse to bhs @xcite .",
    "bhs in the context of high - energy physics have also been discussed by pretorius @xcite and in the white paper @xcite .",
    "a recent review of numerical simulations of black strings in five spacetime dimensions is given by lehner and pretorius @xcite .",
    "an overview about numerical results on bhs in @xmath200 dimensions is given in @xcite .",
    "finally we note kanti s review on bhs at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we conclude this review with a brief summary of the most urgent problems to be tackled by numerical relativity in the three main areas in the near future .",
    "* _ gravitational wave physics : _ * in order to meet tight accuracy requirements in gw template generation , especially for parameter estimation , we either need longer numerical waveforms or a denser spacing of templates in the parameter space . both approaches will require computational resources that grow non - linearly as a function of the accuracy , either because of the slow nature of the inspiral at larger bh separations ( see sec .  2 in @xcite for a quantitative discussion ) or because of the dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "a second major task is the extension of existing template models to generic binaries with precessing spins and/or smaller mass ratios , bridging the gap to perturbative modeling of extreme mass ratio binaries .    * _ astrophysics : _ * while existing formulae for the kick and final spin resulting from the coalescence of bhs have been helpful for astrophysical studies , the calibration of generic models as proposed by boyle _",
    "@xcite requires a more comprehensive exploration of the parameter space .",
    "the relatively young field of numerical relativity simulations of bhs surrounded by accretion disks will likely improve our insight into expected optical counterparts to bh binary mergers , and thus provide a vital tool for the area of _ multi - messanger astrophysics_.    * _ high - energy physics : _ * arguably the most urgent task is the determination of the scattering cross - section and the loss of energy and momentum in gws in trans - planckian scattering of bhs in _ arbitrary _ dimensions . in view of the stability problems encountered in present studies",
    ", it also appears desirable to obtain a better understanding of the well - posedness of the formulations currently employed for such studies .",
    "second , the modeling of bhs in generic spacetimes such as de sitter and anti - de sitter is still in its infancy , even if preliminary studies of bhs in non - asymptotically flat spacetimes are encouraging . a better understanding of boundary issues",
    ", well - posedness of the formulations and diagnostics such as wave extraction tools and horizon finders will be required to open up this uncharted and fertile ground of research .",
