    "supersymmetric theories possess remarkable properties on the quantum level .",
    "these properties are provided by non - renormalization theorems according to which supersymmetric theories have a much better ultraviolet behavior than the non - supersymmetric ones .",
    "the most famous example is , certainly , the @xmath5 , @xmath6 supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theory , which is finite conformal invariant quantum field theory model @xcite .",
    "perturbative quantum corrections in @xmath5 , @xmath0 sym theories are finite starting from the two - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath7 supersymmetric theories have less number of independent renormalization constants in comparison with the non - supersymmetric ones and the superpotential has no quantum corrections @xcite .",

    "the most elegant approach to the non - renormalization theorems is obtained in the framework of the superfield formulation of supersymmetric theories . in this case , the proof of the non - renormalization theorems is based on three points : ( i ) superspace structure of superpropagators , containing the delta - functions of anticommuting variables that allow to shrink the loops into dots in @xmath8 space , ( ii ) the superfield background field method for supersymmetric gauge theories , and ( iii ) an assumption about existence of a regularization manifestly preserving the supersymmetry ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "first two points are realized in the explicit form . as to the last one",
    ", it is not very clear from the beginning , how to construct a regularization which preserves the supersymmetry and which will be convenient for practical computations of supergraphs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , a part of the proofs of the non - renormalization theorems based on the above assumption needs an additional justification .",
    "it is known that the usually used dimensional regularization @xcite , explicitly breaks the supersymmetry ( see e.g. @xcite ) , because numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom differently depend on the space - time dimension .",
    "most calculations of quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories are done using the regularization by the dimensional reduction @xcite , which is a special modification of the dimensional regularization , and the @xmath9-scheme . using @xmath9-scheme the finiteness of the @xmath6 sym theory",

    "however , it is known that the dimensional reduction is not consistent from the mathematical point of view @xcite . due to this inconsistency",
    "any @xmath11 supersymmetry can be broken by quantum corrections in higher loops @xcite .",

    "superfields @xcite and , therefore , does not break @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to the supersymmetric regularization , manifestly supersymmetric quantization of a theory also requires supersymmetric gauge fixing procedure . in the case of @xmath1 supersymmetric theories structure of divergences",

    "the gauge can be fixed without breaking @xmath1 supersymmetry @xcite and the quantum corrections are calculated in a manifestly @xmath1 supersymmetric way that makes this procedure very convenient .",
    "application of the higher covariant derivative regularization ( complemented by a supersymmetric gauge condition ) to calculation of quantum corrections for @xmath1 supersymmetric theories allows to explain naturally the origin of the exact nsvz @xmath2-function .",
    "loop integrals for the @xmath2-function appear to be integrals of total derivatives @xcite and even integrals of double total derivatives @xcite",
    ". a qualitative explanation of this fact can be given by analyzing feynman rules @xcite using a method proposed in @xcite . because the integrands in integrals which determine a @xmath2-function are total derivatives , at least one of the loop integrals can be calculated analytically .",
    "this gives the nsvz relation between the @xmath2-function and the anomalous dimension which are defined in terms of the bare coupling constant @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath1 supersymmetric electrodynamics this was proved in all orders @xcite . as a consequence , in the abelian case",
    "the nsvz @xmath2-function was obtained exactly in all orders of the perturbation theory for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the bare coupling constant .",
    "if the renormalization group functions are defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant , the nsvz @xmath2-function is obtained in a special subtraction scheme , which can be naturally constructed if the theory is regularized by higher covariant derivatives @xcite .",
    "this ( nsvz ) scheme is obtained by imposing the boundary conditions ( [ nsvz_scheme ] ) on the renormalization constants .",
    "however , so far there is no proof that in non - abelian theories the exact nsvz @xmath2-function is obtained with the higher covariant derivative regularization in all orders .",
    "nevertheless , arguments based on anomalies @xcite and explicit calculations in the lowest loops @xcite allow to suggest this .",
    "therefore , using the invariant regularization for @xmath1 supersymmetric theories it is possible to make general conclusions concerning the structure of divergences .",

    "the higher covariant derivative regularization is formulated in terms of @xmath1 superfields .",
    "certainly , @xmath0 sym theories can be written in terms of @xmath1 superfields ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , in this case only @xmath1 supersymmetry is manifest , the second supersymmetry being hidden and on - shell .",

    "it does not guarantee that total @xmath0 supersymmetry is not broken by quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , the effective action is invariant only under the manifest supersymmetry , and it is not clear , whether it is invariant under the second ( hidden ) supersymmetry .    in this paper , using the formulation of @xmath0 sym theories in terms of @xmath1 superfields , we construct a manifestly @xmath1 supersymmetric higher covariant derivative regularization , which is also invariant under the hidden supersymmetry .",

    "we find that if the effective action is invariant under the background gauge transformations and background @xmath0 supersymmetry , then all anomalous dimensions of the chiral superfields vanish .",
    "staring from the exact nsvz @xmath2-function we prove that beyond one loop the divergences are completely determined by the anomalous dimension @xmath12 of the chiral superfield @xmath3 ( which forms the @xmath0 vector supermultiplet together with the gauge superfield @xmath4 ) . as a result , vanishing the @xmath2-function beyond the one - loop approximation depends on whether the this anomalous dimension vanishes or not .",
