    "experimental progress in the exclusive @xmath2 reaction in recent years has provided a clear picture of the limitations of the simple shell - model description of closed - shell nuclei .",
    "of particular interest is the reduction of the single - particle ( sp ) strength for the removal of particles with valence hole quantum numbers with respect to the simple shell - model estimate which corresponds to a spectroscopic factor of 1 for such states .",
    "typical experimental results@xcite for closed - shell nuclei exhibit reductions of about 30% to 45% for these spectroscopic factors . in the case of @xmath4 ,",
    "one obtains a spectroscopic factor for the transition to the ground state of @xmath5 of about 0.65 which is associated with the removal of a @xmath6 proton . an analysis which uses information obtained from elastic electron scattering , indicates that the total occupation number for this state is about 10% higher@xcite , corresponding to 0.75 .",
    "this additional background strength should be present at higher missing energy and is presumed to be highly fragmented .",
    "the depletion of more deeply bound orbitals is expected to be somewhat less as suggested by theoretical considerations@xcite which also indicate that the strength in the background , outside the main peak , corresponds to about 10% ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recent experimental results for @xmath7@xcite yield a combined quasihole strength for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states corresponding to about 65% with the @xmath8 strength concentrated in one peak and the @xmath10 strength fragmented already over several peaks .",
    "recent theoretical results yield about 76% for these @xmath3 states@xcite without reproducing the fragmentation of the @xmath10 strength .",
    "this calculation includes the influence of both long - range correlations , associated with a large shell - model space , as well as short - range correlations .",
    "although the inclusion of long - range correlations yields a good representation of the @xmath11 strength , it fails to account for the presence of positive parity fragments below the first @xmath12 fragment .",
    "this suggests that additional improvement of the treatment of long - range correlations is indicated possibly including a correct treatment of the center - of - mass motion@xcite .",
    "the contribution to the depletion of the sp strength due to short - range correlations is typically about 10% .",
    "this result is obtained both in nuclear matter calculations , as reviewed in @xcite , and in calculations directly for finite ( medium-)heavy nuclei@xcite .",
    "although the influence of long - range correlations on the distribution of the sp strength is substantial , it is clear that a sizable fraction of the missing sp strength is due to short - range effects .",
    "the experimental data@xcite indicate that only about 70% of the expected protons in the nucleus has been detected in the energy and momentum domain studied so far .",
    "it is therefore important to establish precisely where the protons which have been admixed into the nuclear ground state due to short - range and tensor correlations , can be detected in the @xmath2 reaction and with what cross section .",
    "the influence of short - range correlations on the presence of high - momentum components in finite ( medium-)heavy nuclei has been calculated in @xcite . in this work",
    "the spectral function for @xmath7 has been calculated from a realistic interaction without recourse to some form of local density approximation@xcite .",
    "no substantial high - momentum components are obtained in @xcite at small missing energy . with increasing missing energy",
    ", however , one recovers the high - momentum components which have been admixed into the ground state .",
    "the physics of these features can be traced back to the realization that the admixture of high - momenta requires the coupling to two - hole - one - particle ( 2h1p ) states in the self - energy for a nucleon with high momentum . in nuclear matter",
    "the conservation of momentum requires the equality of the 2h1p momentum in the self - energy and the external high momentum .",
    "since the two - hole state has a relatively small total pair momentum , one automatically needs an essentially equally large and opposite momentum for the intermediate one - particle state to fulfill momentum conservation . as a result",
    ", the relevant intermediate 2h1p states will lie at increasing excitation energy with increasing momentum .",
    "considerations of this type are well known for nuclear matter ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but are approximately valid in finite nuclei as well .",
    "recent experiments on @xmath4@xcite and @xmath7@xcite essentially confirm that the presence of high - momentum components in the quasihole states accounts for only a tiny fraction of the sp strength .    the theoretical prediction concerning the presence of high - momentum components at high missing energy remains to be verified experimentally , however . in order to facilitate and support these efforts , the present work aims to combine the calculation of the spectral function at these energies with the description of both the electromagnetic vertex and final state interactions ( fsi ) in order to produce realistic estimates of the exclusive @xmath2 cross section under experimental conditions possible at nikhef and mainz .",
    "the impulse approximation has been adopted for the electromagnetic current operator , which describes the nonrelativistic reduction ( up to fourth order in the inverse nucleon mass  @xcite ) of the coupling between the external virtual photon and single nucleons only .",
    "the treatment of fsi has been developed by the pavia group  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and takes into account the average complex optical potential the nucleon experiences on its way out of the nucleus .",
    "other contributions to the exclusive @xmath2 reaction are present in principle , such as two - step mechanisms in the final state or the decay of initial collective excitations in the target nucleus . however , by transferring sufficiently high energy @xmath13 to the target nucleus and by selecting typical kinematical conditions corresponding to the socalled quasielastic peak with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 the momentum transfer and @xmath16 the nucleon mass ) , these contributions are suppressed . in these conditions , adopted in the most recent experiments , the direct knockout mechanism has been shown to be the dominant contribution  @xcite and essentially corresponds to calculating the combined probability for exciting a correlated particle ( which is ultimately detected ) and a correlated hole such that energy and momentum are conserved but no further interaction of the particle with the hole is included .    the calculation of the spectral function for @xmath7 is reviewed in sec .",
    "special attention is given to a separable representation of the spectral function which facilitates the practical implementation of the inclusion of fsi . in sec .",
    "iii the general formalism of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) is briefly reviewed .",
    "the influence of the fsi is studied in sec .",
    "iv for the quasihole transitions for which data are available@xcite . extending the calculation of the cross section to higher missing energies",
    "yields the expected rise of high missing - momentum components in the cross section in comparison to the results near the fermi energy .",
    "the contribution of various partial waves is studied demonstrating the increasing importance of higher @xmath17-values with increasing missing momentum .",
    "all these results are discussed in sec .",
    "iv and a brief summary is presented in sec . v.",
    "the calculation of the cross section for exclusive @xmath2 processes requires the knowledge of the hole spectral function which is defined in the following way @xmath18 where the summation over @xmath19 runs over the discrete excited states as well as over the continuum of the ( a-1 ) particle system , @xmath20 is the ground state of the initial nucleus and @xmath21 @xmath22 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator with the specified sp quantum numbers for momenta and third component of spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "the spectral function is diagonal in the third component of the isospin and ignoring the coulomb interaction between the protons , the spectral functions for protons and neutrons are identical for n = z nuclei . therefore in the following we have dropped the isospin quantum number @xmath23 .",
    "note that the energy variable @xmath24 in this definition of the spectral function refers to minus the excitation energy of state @xmath19 in the a-1 particle system with respect to the ground - state energy @xmath25 of the nucleus with a nucleons .    to proceed",
    "further in the calculations it is useful to introduce a partial wave decomposition which yields the spectral function for a nucleon in the sp basis with orbital angular momentum @xmath17 , total angular momentum @xmath26 , and momentum @xmath3 @xmath27 where @xmath28(@xmath29 ) denotes the corresponding removal ( addition ) operator .",
    "the spectral functions for the various partial waves , @xmath30 , have been obtained from the imaginary part of the corresponding sp propagator @xmath31 .",
    "this green s function solves the dyson equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 refers to a hartree - fock propagator and @xmath34 represents contributions to the real and imaginary parts of the irreducible self - energy , which go beyond the hartree - fock approximation of the nucleon self - energy used to derive @xmath33 .",
    "although the evaluation of the self - energy as well as the solution of the dyson equation has been discussed in detail in previous publications @xcite we include here a brief summary of the relevant aspects of the method .",
    "the self - energy is evaluated in terms of a @xmath35-matrix which is obtained as a solution of the bethe - goldstone equation for nuclear matter choosing for the bare nn interaction the one - boson - exchange potential b defined by machleidt ( ref .",
    "@xcite , table a.2 ) .",
    "the bethe - goldstone equation has been solved for a fermi momentum @xmath36 and starting energy @xmath37 mev .",
    "the choices for the density of nuclear matter and the starting energy are rather arbitrary .",
    "it turns out , however , that the calculation of the hartree - fock term ( fig .",
    "1a ) is not very sensitive to this choice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will correct this nuclear matter approximation by calculating the two - particle - one - hole ( 2p1h ) term displayed in fig .",
    "1b directly for the finite system .",
    "this second - order correction , which assumes harmonic oscillator states for the occupied ( hole ) states and plane waves for the intermediate unbound particle states , incorporates the correct energy and density dependence characteristic of a finite nucleus @xmath35-matrix . to evaluate the diagrams in fig . 1",
    ", we need matrix elements in a mixed representation of one particle in a bound harmonic oscillator while the other is in a plane wave state . using vector bracket transformation coefficients",
    "@xcite one can transform matrix elements from the representation in coordinates of relative and center - of - mass momenta to the coordinates of sp momenta in the laboratory frame in which the two particle state is described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 refer to momentum and angular momenta of particle @xmath42 whereas @xmath43 and @xmath44 define the total angular momentum and isospin of the two - particle state . performing an integration over one of the @xmath39 ,",

    "the terms of lowest order in @xmath35 which give rise to an imaginary part in the self - energy are represented by the diagrams displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : diag]b and [ fig : diag]c , referring to intermediate 2p1h and 2h1p states respectively .",
    "the 2p1h contribution to the imaginary part is given by @xmath51 where the `` experimental '' sp energies @xmath52 are used for the hole states ( @xmath53 mev , @xmath54 mev , @xmath55 mev for @xmath56 , @xmath9 and @xmath57 states , respectively ) , while the energies of the particle states are given in terms of the kinetic energy only .",
    "the plane waves associated with the particle states in the intermediate states are properly orthogonalized to the bound sp states following the techniques discussed by borromeo et al . @xcite .",
    "the 2h1p contribution to the imaginary part @xmath58 can be calculated in a similar way ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our choice to assume pure kinetic energies for the particle states in calculating the imaginary parts of @xmath59 ( eq .  ( [ eq : w2p1h ] ) ) and @xmath60 may not be very realistic for the excitation modes at low energy .",
    "indeed a sizable imaginary part in @xmath60 is obtained only for energies @xmath24 below @xmath61 mev .",
    "as we are mainly interested , however , in the effects of short - range correlations , which lead to excitations of particle states with high momentum , the choice seems to be appropriate .",
    "a different approach would be required to treat the coupling to the very low - lying 2p1h and 2h1p states in an adequate way .",
    "attempts at such a treatment can be found in refs .",
    "the 2p1h contribution to the real part of the self - energy can be calculated from the imaginary part @xmath59 using a dispersion relation @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents a principal value integral .",
    "a similar dispersion relation holds for @xmath64 and @xmath60 .    since the hartree ",
    "fock contribution @xmath65 has been calculated in terms of a nuclear matter @xmath35-matrix , it already contains 2p1h terms of the kind displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]b . in order to avoid such an overcounting of the particle - particle ladder terms",
    ", we subtract from the real part of the self - energy a correction term ( @xmath66 ) , which just contains the 2p1h contribution calculated in nuclear matter .",
    "summing up the various contributions we obtain for the self - energy the following expressions @xmath67      the next step is to solve the dyson equation ( [ eq : dyson ] ) for the sp propagator . to this aim , we discretize the integrals in this equation by considering a complete basis within a spherical box of a radius @xmath68 .",
    "the calculated observables are independent of the choice of @xmath68 , if it is chosen to be around 15 fm or larger .",
    "a complete and orthonormal set of regular basis functions within this box is given by @xmath69 in this equation @xmath70 represent the spherical harmonics including the spin degrees of freedom and @xmath71 denote the spherical bessel functions for the discrete momenta @xmath39 which fulfill @xmath72    note that the basis functions defined for discrete values of the momentum @xmath39 within the box differ from the plane wave states defined in the continuum with the corresponding momentum just by the normalization constant , which is @xmath73 for the latter .",
    "this enables us to determine the matrix elements of the nucleon self - energy in the basis of eq .",

    "the energies and wave functions of these quasihole states can be determined by diagonalizing the hartree - fock hamiltonian plus @xmath80 in the `` box basis '' @xmath86 since in the present work @xmath80 only contains a sizable imaginary part for energies @xmath24 below @xmath87 , the energies of the quasihole states are real and the continuum contribution to the spectral function is separated in energy from the quasihole contribution . the quasihole contribution to the hole spectral function",

    "long - range correlations yield a splitting such that 86% of the total strength going to these three states is contained in the experimental data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this splitting is not observed in the theoretical calculations . if one divides the adjusted spectroscopic factor @xmath153 by 0.86 to account for the splitting of the experimental strength , one obtains a value of 0.624 which is close to the total spectroscopic factor adjusted to describe the knockout of a proton from @xmath8 state .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] also contains the results for the reduced cross section derived by substituting the overlap @xmath154^{1\\over 2 } \\phi^{}_{e n}$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattampl1 ] ) with the variational wave function of pieper et al.@xcite , who employed the argonne potential for the nn interaction@xcite .",
    "also in this case the shape of the experimental data is globally reproduced with a slightly better agreement for small negative values of @xmath155 but with a clear underestimation at larger @xmath155 .",
    "the overall quality of the fit is somewhat worse than for the green s function approach and the required adjusted spectroscopic factor is @xmath156 , even below the value of 0.537 needed in the present calculation .",
    "the analysis of the reduced cross section has been extended to higher missing momenta by experiments performed at the mami accelerator in mainz@xcite , adopting different kinematical conditions than the parallel kinematics . using the same spectroscopic factors for the @xmath10 and the @xmath8 partial waves , which were adjusted to the nikhef data above , the results of our calculations agree quite well also with these mami data , as displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2a ] .",
    "although the calculation is somewhat below the data at high missing momentum , one should keep in mind that the corresponding difference in sp strength is only an extremely tiny fraction of the 10% of the protons which are expected to be associated with high momenta due to short - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "> from theoretical studies it is known that an enhancement of the high - momentum components due to short - range nn correlations does not show up in knockout experiments leading to states of low excitation energy in the ( a-1 ) nucleus , but should be seen at higher missing energies , which correspond to large excitation energies in the residual nucleus . a careful analysis of such reactions leading to final states above the threshold for two - nucleon emission , however , is much more involved .",
    "for example , a description of the electromagnetic vertex beyond the impulse approximation is needed and two - body current operators must be adopted which are consistent with the contributions included in the spectral function . moreover",
    ", the possible further fragmentation of the ( a-1 ) residual system requires , for a realistic description of fsi , a coupled - channel formalism with many open channels .",
    "calculations based on the optical potential are not satisfactory at such missing energies , because inelastic rescatterings and multi - step processes will add and remove strength from this particular channel .    nevertheless , it should be of interest to analyze the predictions of the present approach at such missing energies .",
    "first of all , because it represents the first realistic attempt of a complete calculation of the single - particle channel leading to the final proton emission , including intermediate states above the fermi level up to @xmath157 ; therefore , it represents a realistic estimate of the relative size of this specific channel . secondly , because information on the shape of the reduced cross section as a function of the missing momentum or on the relative contribution of various partial waves could yield reliable results even at these missing energies . due to the problems mentioned above",
    ", no reliable description of the absolute value of the reduced cross section can be reached in this framework .    in order to demonstrate the energy dependence of the spectral function and its effect on the cross section , we have calculated the reduced cross section for the excitation of @xmath150 states at @xmath158 mev . for these studies we considered the socalled perpendicular kinematics , where the energy of the emitted proton is kept fixed at 90 mev as well as the momentum transfer at @xmath159 mev / c ( equal to the outgoing proton momentum ) . the same optical potential as in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , [ fig : fig2 ] can be adopted to describe fsi and the missing momentum distribution is obtained by varying the angle between @xmath160 and @xmath140 . for a spectral function normalized to unity ( as the absolute result for the cross section is not reliable ) , the reduced cross section is represented by the solid line in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] . if , however , we replace the spectral function derived from the continuum contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : renor ] ) by the one derived for the @xmath150 quasihole state at its proper missing energy ( but now in the same kind of perpendicular kinematics and normalized to 1 ) we obtain the dashed line .",
    "a comparison of these two calculations demonstrates the enhancement of the high - momentum components in the spectral function leading to final states at large excitation energies .",
    "note that the cross section derived from the appropriate spectral function is about two orders of magnitude larger at @xmath161 mev / c than the one derived from the spectral function at the quasihole energy .",
    "the discussion so far is of course somewhat academic since it will be difficult to perform a decomposition of the continuum contribution to the reduced cross section in terms of the quantum numbers for angular momentum and parity of the state for the residual system .",
    "therefore we display in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] the contributions to the total reduced cross section of the various partial waves associated to states above the fermi level and usually unoccupied in the standard shell model . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we can furthermore see that the relative importance of the various partial waves changes with the missing momentum , emphasizing the contribution of higher angular momenta at increasing @xmath155 .",
    "this feature can be observed even better in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , where the percentage of each relative contribution to the total reduced cross section is displayed as a function of the missing momentum . for each orbital angular momentum",
    "we obtain a `` window '' in @xmath155 where its contribution shows a maximum as compared to other partial waves .",
    "in the present paper the consequences of the presence of high - momentum components in the @xmath162o ground state have been explored in the calculation of the @xmath2 cross section within the formalism for the dwia developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the spectral functions have been calculated for the @xmath162o system itself , by employing the techniques developed and discussed in@xcite . at low missing energies ,",
    "the description of the missing momentum dependence of the @xmath163 and @xmath164 quasihole states compares favorably with the experimental data obtained at nikhef@xcite and at the mami facility in mainz@xcite .",
    "the difference between theory and experiment at high missing momenta can at most account for a very tiny fraction of the sp strength which is predicted to be present at these momenta@xcite .",
    "a comparison with the pwia result clarifies the influence of fsi in parallel kinematics .",
    "we also compare our results for the @xmath164 quasihole state with the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the argonne nn interaction .",
    "while the shape of the cross sections is nicely described by our results , the associated spectroscopic factors are overestimated substantially .",
    "although a large fraction of this discrepancy can be ascribed to the influence of long - range correlations@xcite , which are outside the scope of the present work , a discrepancy may still remain although it has been suggested that a correct treatment of the center - of - mass motion@xcite may fill this gap .    as discussed previously for nuclear matter",
    "( see @xmath165 @xcite ) and emphasized in @xcite for finite nuclei , the admixture of high - momentum components in the nuclear ground state can only be explored by considering high missing energies in the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "although other processes may contribute to the cross section at these energies , we have demonstrated in this paper that the expected emergence of high missing momentum components in the cross section is indeed obtained and yields substantially larger cross sections than the corresponding outcome for the quasihole states . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the presence of high - momentum components leads to a detectable cross section at high missing energy .",
    "in addition , we observe that it is important to include orbital angular momenta at least up to @xmath166 in the spectral function in order to account for all the high missing momentum components up to about 600 mev / c . a clear window for the dominant contribution of each @xmath17-value as a function of missing momentum is also established .",
