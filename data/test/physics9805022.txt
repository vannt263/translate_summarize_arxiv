    "the dynamics of relaxing quantum systems in sufficiently strong laser fields , which are neither stationary nor monochromatic , is an important aspect of the theory of interaction between atoms and photon fields .",
    "this problem is of particular practical significance because of dramatic advances in the precision of measurements presently attainable in spectroscopic experimental studies of hydrogenic and few  particle atoms . among the simple atoms that attracted attention in the last few years one should mention : _ hydrogen _ and its isotopes @xcite , _ positronium _",
    "@xcite , denoted @xmath2 , _ muonium _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) , denoted @xmath3 , and _ helium _ atom @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the ground state hfs and the lamb shift are of particular interest for these systems .",
    "high precision spectroscopy of low  lying transitions in hydrogenic atoms offers a unique opportunity to test qed calculations and to refine both the fundamental constants and various properties of respective nuclei .",
    "this urges further theoretical developments intended to describe the well established photon - induced processes in simple atoms with much higher precision than techniques used so far are able to provide , in order to allow a proper interpretation of newly available experimental data . in the present paper the stepwise 3-photon ionization of muonium in a _",
    "non  monochromatic _ laser field with a _ time ",
    "dependent _ amplitude is studied .",
    "it has been recognized already a long time ago ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) that the @xmath1 transition offers unique opportunities for high precision spectroscopy due to the narrow natural line width , @xmath4 , of the @xmath5-state . in the hydrogen atom , for example , @xmath6  hz which enables the quality factor of @xmath7 to be achieved already today , as well as suggests future resolutions of order of 1 part in @xmath8 .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath1 transition can be induced doppler  free by absorbing two photons from two counter  propagating laser beams . in particular , this scheme is presently used at the rutherford appleton laboratory  @xcite for determination of the @xmath1 energy separation in muonium to the @xmath9  mhz accuracy .",
    "this study offers an opportunity to improve the present knowledge of the muon / electron mass ratio and , thereby , of the muon mass itself . in the course of this investigation ,",
    "two counter  propagating pulsed laser beams with almost identical intensities , @xmath10 , and the same photon energies , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 nm ) are used .",
    "thus , the frequency @xmath13 is such that it is tuned into resonance with the 2photon doppler  free @xmath14 transition . unlike the hydrogen case however , the @xmath1 transition in muonium is hard to be observed directly , i.e. by detecting radiation emitted as a result of the @xmath5state deexcitation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the appropriate line intensities in muonium happen to be weaker by several orders of magnitude , owing to much lower densities at which muonium atoms can be produced .",
    "furthermore , the latter reason necessitates the use of higher laser intensities ( by a factor of @xmath15 , at least ) that are required for a reasonable signal strength .",
    "this demands a _ pulsed _ rather than a cw laser source ( as in the case of hydrogen @xcite ) to be employed .",
    "the @xmath5state of muonium is detected therefore via its photoionization by the third photon absorbed from one of the laser beams @xcite .",
    "schematically , the experiment in muonium is presented in figure  [ fig1](a ) where @xmath16 stands for the resonant energy ( frequency ) which drives the 2photon @xmath1 transition .",
    "despite the fact that the laser frequency can be calibrated , in principle , to a rather high accuracy , there are a number of systematic error sources each of which proves to be essential for precise determination of the @xmath1 energy separation in muonium . in this paper",
    "we report the results of the theoretical study intended to allow for one of the most important among these effects , that is , the time - dependent frequency variation ( chirp ) of the laser field .",
    "this phenomenon arises due to the rapid refraction index variation of the _ laser media _ and is hardly avoidable , especially with powerful pulsed lasers , unless some technical developments are made in order to compensate the frequency alteration  @xcite .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , the chirped laser signal immediately makes its appearance in appreciable spurious shifting and broadening of spectral / photoionization lines , as well as leads to a noticeable distortion of the line shapes . to estimate the scale of the effect considered , one should note , for example , that the chirp  induced shift of the center of the ionization line is roughly equal to a characteristic magnitude of the chirp itself . for the @xmath1 experiment in muonium",
    ", the latter can typically amount to @xmath17 , thus leading to the relative shift of the line s center by @xmath18 .",
    "the effects of such an order are usually completely neglected in atomic physics .",
    "nonetheless , these happen to be crucial for studies where an absolute accuracy of @xmath19 is anticipated .",
    "it is therefore of primary practical importance to work out a relatively simple theoretical scheme which could allow one to describe certain types of multi - photon ionization phenomena in hydrogenic atoms , where an arbitrary time variation of the frequency of the laser field is accompanied by an arbitrary time modulation of its amplitude .",
    "although the problem of the hydrogenic systems interaction with monochromatic resonant laser field with / without the amplitude modulation is investigated quite fully by now ( see @xcite and references therein ) , there have been much fewer studies where both the amplitude and the frequency of the laser signal vary with time .",
    "even though , the authors confine themselves in most cases to either 1photon ( rather than 2photon ) resonant transition @xcite , or treat only somewhat special forms ( `` abrupt step '' , `` exponential field pulses '' etc . ) of the field modulation @xcite . under these circumstances , it seems very desirable to reconsider the problem as a whole , while adapting it specifically to the conditions of the @xmath1 experiment in muonium .",
    "we consider , without a loss of generality , a set of three levels : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of a hydrogenic atom with the charge @xmath22 of its nucleus , such that their one  particle energies satisfy the inequality : @xmath23 ; this rather general setup is shown in figure [ fig1](b ) .",
    "it is supposed that the given 3level system is exposed to two counter  propagating ( along the @xmath24axis ) laser waves with equal time ",
    "dependent ( circular ) frequencies , @xmath25 , polarizations vectors , @xmath26 , and wave vectors , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fine structure constant and @xmath29 denotes the speed of light .",
    "the stationary part , @xmath30 , of the field frequency @xmath31 is assumed to be such that it is in the 2 and 1photon resonances with the pairs of states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the differences of the one  particle energies .",
    "in addition , it is supposed that the @xmath36transition is forbidden between @xmath37 and @xmath38 and is allowed between @xmath38 and @xmath21 .    under the resonance conditions assumed above , 3photon ionization of the system ,",
    "that is , @xmath39 transition , occurs predominantly as a 2step process : ( i ) a 2photon resonant absorption from the state @xmath37 into the state @xmath38 , followed by ( ii ) a 1photon resonant transition between the levels @xmath38 and @xmath21 .",
    "this simple physical picture is a consequence of the evident estimate of the probability for an atom to absorb 3 photons of equal energies ( the atomic units , @xmath40 , are used throughout the paper ; in this system , the speed of light is equal to @xmath41 ) : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 are the 2 and 1photon resonant transition probabilities , @xmath44 is the total width of the state @xmath38 , and @xmath45 denotes some characteristic mean energy which a two  fold summation over intermediate states in the exact expression to define @xmath46 ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) can be reduced to . equation ( [ 3phot ] ) readily follows then from the estimate , @xmath47 , which is fulfilled for most states of atoms in moderately strong laser fields , except extraordinarily short  living ones .",
    "a situation when @xmath37 stands for the ground , @xmath38 for the @xmath5 , and @xmath21 for the continuum @xmath48states , respectively , is of our primary concern here . in this case @xmath49 and @xmath50 since @xmath51 is dominated by the photoionization rate of the @xmath5level ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "accordingly , we will assume that the natural line widths of the @xmath37- and @xmath38levels are both equal to zero : @xmath53 .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the latter condition , that might be required for the treatment of _ excited _ states , can be achieved by adding appropriate imaginary parts to the energies of the levels  @xcite : @xmath54 .    in the semiclassical approximation , which happens to be accurate enough for our purposes ,",
    "the electric fields inducing the 2 and 1photon transitions can be taken in the form @xmath55 here , the real functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 describe the ( macroscopic ) spatial inhomogeneity of the laser field and its time - dependent amplitude .",
    "these are related direct to the laser intensity @xmath58 which , along with the chirped ( circular ) laser frequency @xmath31 , is obtainable direct from measurements . for the @xmath1 experiment with muonium , @xmath58 and @xmath31",
    "can be well approximated as @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60  mj is the energy within one laser pulse ; @xmath61  ns , @xmath62  mm denote the temporal and spatial dispersions of the external laser field ( in the @xmath63 plane perpendicular to the direction of the beams propagation ) .",
    "the full temporal width of the laser pulse is expressed then as @xmath64  ns .",
    "parameter @xmath65 mhz defines the magnitude of the chirp @xmath66 , being actually detected in the experiment , and @xmath67 stands for the error function @xcite .    as",
    "usually happens to be true in most practical situations , both the amplitude @xmath68 and the additonal phase @xmath69 vary much slower with time than @xmath70 and @xmath31(see equations ( [ intens])-([omega ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the chirp is normally much smaller than the `` base '' frequency @xmath30",
    ". it is therefore permissible to assume that @xmath31 and @xmath68 are subject to the following general conditions @xcite : @xmath71 within the framework of the conventional time ",
    "dependent perturbation theory @xcite , the exact time ",
    "dependent wave function of the quasi ",
    "stationary state @xmath72 in the field is sought in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , being the amplitudes to find an atom in one of the unperturbed states @xmath75 , satisfy the following well known system of coupled differential equations : @xmath76 here , @xmath77 denotes the matrix element of @xmath78 being the operator of the `` particle  laser field '' interaction . due to",
    "the given below reasons , @xmath78 can be taken in the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the dipole operator of an electron ( or a muon ) and @xmath81 denotes the electric field  ( [ fields ] ) seen by the atom in its rest frame .",
    "for particular laser parameters of interest , the accuracy of the above approximation follows from the evident estimate : @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the contribution of the quadrupole terms @xmath83 , which originate from the spatial _ macroscopic _ inhomogeneity of @xmath81 , is expected to be a factor @xmath84 smaller than the contribution of the ( dipole ) terms in ( [ dip_appr ] ) .",
    "almost the same estimate holds also for corrections arising due to the quadrupole component @xmath85 of the photon field itself .",
    "this is despite the fact that the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 are coupled , in accord with the initial assumptions of our model and equation ( [ dip_appr ] ) , in only the second order of the perturbation theory in @xmath78 , i.e. by taking into account at least the 2photon absorption / emission . indeed , unlike the second order dipole coupling , the 1photon quadrupole @xmath86 in the amplitude .",
    "if @xmath87 , as it is assumed throughout the paper , then the terms of such a type are known to be almost negligible @xcite . in our case , in particular , their relative contribution is of the order of @xmath88 , as can be shown by averaging the transition amplitude over some time interval : @xmath89 .",
    "the same `` off - resonant '' argument is fully applicable to magnetic transitions as well , thus elucidating why the @xmath90 and @xmath91contributions are suppressed by a factor @xmath92 as compared to the dipole one .    by virtue of ( [ a])-([dip_appr ] ) , one can readily retrieve , after some conventional algebra , the following form for effective quasiclassical one  particle operators which couple two given states of reference @xcite : @xmath93 all summations are performed here over complete set of one - particle atomic orbitals",
    ". equations ( [ vba])-([vab ] ) describe the real transitions , whereas ( [ vbb ] ) defines the _ ac stark _ shift of the level @xmath38 ( or @xmath37 , if @xmath94 ) which arises due to interaction of the atom with the incident radiation .",
    "note that the sum in ( [ vbb ] ) coincides , by definition @xcite , with the dipole dynamic polarizability of the state @xmath38 at the frequency @xmath95 .",
    "also , it should be pointed out that only the leading terms , as given by equations ( [ vba])-([vbb ] ) , were retained in the course of derivation .",

    "as was assumed above , there are no other discrete resonant atomic levels ( either 1 or 2photon ) except @xmath20 .",
    "this enables the system ( [ a ] ) to be reduced to these two states only , and @xmath99 , is ignored , since we are mainly concerned here with the lowest @xmath100- and @xmath5states . ] while describing the 1st stage of the two ",
    "step 3photon ionization process under consideration .",
    "indeed , an inclusion of the off - resonant states would give rise in the right - hand side of equations ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) to the rapidly @xmath101varying terms @xmath102 .",
    "after temporal averaging ( see above ) , these happen to be of order of @xmath103 , and can therefore be omitted to the accuracy adopted in this study .",
    "on introducing the new functions , @xmath104 \\right\\ } , \\label{alpha_c}\\ ] ] and replacing the matrix elements in ( [ a ] ) by equations ( [ vba])-([vbb ] ) , one arrives at the following system of equations : @xmath105 , \\\\",

    "independent frequency detuning off the resonance , @xmath107 is the intensity of the single laser beam and @xmath108 denote the effective matrix elements given by the sums in ( [ vba])-([vbb ] ) .",
    "it has been taken into account here that the 3level system is actually probed by a superposition of two laser fields ( [ fields ] ) , rather than by a single one ; this results eventually in doubling all matrix elements .",
    "in addition , we have neglected a contribution due to the 2photon absorption from _ each _ of two laser beams .",
    "this contribution comes from the second  order interactions of an atom with only one of two light waves and makes its appearance finally in two doppler  broadened terms , i.e. depending on a @xmath109component of atomic velocity in the laboratory frame , in the expression to define ionization probabilities .",
    "however , after averaging over @xmath109 , as would be required within the framework of a systematic approach , these terms turn out to be small compared , at the center of the photoionization line @xcite , with the doppler  free ones which originate from ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) .",
    "these arguments provide the ground for the approximation made , although the effects caused by atomic movement in the media are beyond the scope of our present consideration .",
    "it is relevant to point out here that the matrix elements , @xmath108 , in ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) are @xmath110dependent . in particular",
    ", @xmath111 has a non  zero imaginary part .",
    "the latter allows for a non",
    " zero photoionization rate of the @xmath38state , due to the action of the photon field , since @xmath30 is supposed to exceed the photoionization threshold @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , as was noted above , @xmath111 is proportional to the dynamic ( tensor ) polarizability @xmath113 of the level @xmath38 , which is complex - valued if @xmath114 ( see our recent paper @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 define then the _ ac stark _ shift of the level ( see equation ( [ vbb ] ) ) and its decay probability ( @xmath117 ) via the single photoionization .",
    "this result is in agreement with the optical theorem  @xcite : @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the fine structure constant and @xmath120 denotes the total photoionization cross section of the state @xmath38 .",
    "numerical calculations show that the single photoionization happens to be the main channel of the @xmath38level depopulation .",
    "it is therefore crucial for the correct description of the time ",
    "evolution of the 3level system that this depopulation mechanism is taken in fact into account in ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) through the matrix elements @xmath108 .",
    "an allowance for the 2nd step of the process considered can be made by augmenting the system ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) with an additional equation that explicitly describes the @xmath121 coupling through the single photoionization of the state @xmath38 .",
    "given by ( [ cont ] ) , this extra equation is nothing else but a differential form of the conservation law which determines the probability balance between the states of reference .",
    "moreover , equations ( [ ala1])-([cc1 ] ) can be decoupled by substituting @xmath122 of ( [ ala1 ] ) into ( [ cc1 ] ) to finally get @xmath123 c(t )   \\\\",

    "equations ( [ cc2])-([cont ] ) are well suited for numerical calculations with arbitrary functions defining the spatial and temporal distributions of the laser pulse . in addition",
    ", the given system is rather convenient for analytic treatment , as will be demonstrated in subsection [ subsec : anal_cons ] . in particular",
    ", one can develop further perturbative expansion of equations ( [ cc2])-([ala2 ] ) in terms of the intensity @xmath58 .",
    "this yields analytic formulae which , after setting @xmath135 , agree with those formerly derived in @xcite within the framework of a 2level model , for _ unchirped _ laser signals . despite a relatively simple form of the appropriate equations ,",
    "however , a not very straightforward numerical integration is still required in order to calculate , for example , photoionization line profiles in most practical situations , let alone the fact that the result of the work @xcite is valid for rather weak laser intensities only . note that equations ( [ cc2])-([cont ] ) are free from the latter restriction .",
    "furthermore , unlike our approach employing the probability amplitudes , the problems similar to those considered in this paper are usually treated ( e.g. see @xcite ) in the formalism of the density matrix @xcite . under the physical conditions adopted here , these two approaches are equivalent . to facilitate the adequate comparison however , it is relevant to present here an alternative form of ( [ cc2])-([cont ] ) , by rewriting the system in terms of the density matrix elements : @xmath136 and @xmath137 , denoted as @xmath138 .",
    "this yields : @xmath139 here , 5 unknown functions are subject to the following initial conditions : @xmath140 it should be pointed out that only real quantities enter equations ( [ r2s])-([r_cont ] ) .",

    "apart from that , ( [ cc2])-([cont ] ) and ( [ r2s])-([r_cont ] ) generate identical results , as has been proved by extensive numerical tests carried out by us for laser signals with various forms of the chirp , pulse envelope , and spatial distribution .",
    "however , before we demonstrate appropriate results ( see section [ sec : appl ] ) , it is instructive to present here an approximate but reasonably accurate analytic solution for @xmath141 .",
    "this consideration seems to be rather useful for a qualitative description of the process as a whole , since it reveals some key features which make their appearance due to the non - stationarity of both the frequency and the amplitude of the laser signal .",
    "let us assume , in agreement with ( [ intens ] ) , that the intensity of the incident radiation is gaussian both in time and space and use the most general form of the chirp , @xmath142 ( cf . equation ( [ omega ] ) ) . to start with , consider riccati  type equation ( [ cc2 ] ) to determine the complex  valued function @xmath143 , equation ( [ cc2 ] ) takes the form @xmath144 c(x )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : full } \\lo+   \\rmi d_{b , a } { \\cal i } \\e^{-\\frac{\\tau^2 x^2}{2 \\sigma^2_{\\rm t}}}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the following notations were introduced for brevity : @xmath145 note that @xmath146 depends on the time ",

    ", width=529,height=264 ]    some results of our simulations are presented in figures [ fig2]-[fig5 ] , for various magnitudes of the chirp @xmath226 and various parameters of the laser pulse which are typically used in the measurements of the @xmath1 energy separation in muonium ; particular values employed are indicated in figures [ fig2],[fig3 ] .",
    "both these graphs demonstrate appreciable red  shift of the maxima ( i.e. towards lower frequencies , relative to @xmath311 ) of the photoionization profiles with an increase of the chirp . it must be noted , however , that this shift is caused by a combination of two competing mechanisms : ( i ) the shift being due to the combined _ ac stark _",
    "effect for the @xmath100- and @xmath5levels and ( ii ) that arising because of the chirp itself .",
    "the curves show that the former mechanism turns out to be small compared with the latter at relatively small pulse energies , @xmath312 . at @xmath313 and @xmath314 , for instance , i.e. in the case of completely unchirped laser signal , the _ ac stark _ shift amounts approximately to @xmath19 .",
    "one can anticipate , however , that the relative contribution of the _ ac stark _ shift will increase as the laser intensity increases , since its magnitude is linearly proportional to the laser intensity , whereas the chirp  induced shift is almost intensity  independent .",
    "this behaviour can be seen in figures [ fig3](a , b ) and is summarized in figure [ fig4](a ) showing , in particular , that the _ ac stark _",
    "shift becomes equals to @xmath315 at @xmath316 .",
    "in addition to the shift of the maxima , the curves in figures [ fig2],[fig3 ] exhibit a strong dependence on both the spatial dispersion @xmath237 and the power @xmath161 of the laser signal . it should be noted that an appreciable distortion of the photoionization line shapes happens to be particularly enhanced at relatively large chirp values , where the line profiles become asymmetric .",
    "generally speaking , this asymmetry is an intrinsic feature of the 3photon resonant photoionization occurring under the action of the _ chirped _ pulsed laser signal .",
    "moreover , an asymmetry of the ionization line shapes happens to be one of the most pronounced manifestations of the non - monochromaticity of the laser field .",
    "this phenomenon is basically due to the fact that the chirp , even though its relative magnitude amounts to only @xmath317 in our calculations , violates an equivalence of initial ( @xmath318 ) and final ( @xmath319 ) time moments .",
    "indeed , the photoionization probability turns out to be either more efficient or suppressed , depending on whether the time  dependent chirped laser frequency is in the resonance with the 2photon @xmath320 transition or slightly off it .",
    "the process as a whole becomes then somewhat `` time  sensitive '' , although the form of the laser pulse envelope used is time  invariant .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the gauge of the above asymmetry depends strongly on the laser power , as well as particular forms of the laser amplitude and the chirp .",
    "this dependence can be seen in figures [ fig3](a , b ) where higher @xmath161values as compared with figures [ fig2](a , b ) are used .",
    "the former show that the asymmetry discussed is less pronounced as long as higher laser intensities are involved .",
    "two essential characteristics of the line profiles maximum , that are , the shift and the magnitude , are plotted in figure [ fig4](a , b ) as functions of the laser power for various values of the chirp .",
    "in particular , the graph [ fig4](b ) provides information about the dependence of the line shapes maximum value , @xmath321 , on the pulse energy @xmath161 .",
    "it is quite natural to parameterize this relation by the following simple power law : @xmath322 .",
    "the exponent here proves to be a slow  varying function of the pulse energy , such that @xmath323 . according to this condition",
    ", @xmath324 can be estimated as @xmath325.\\ ] ]    dependence of the exponent , @xmath324 , defined by the relation : + @xmath326.,width=264,height=264 ]    one should note , for example , an appreciable deviation of the @xmath324values from @xmath327 which must be expected for a 2step 3photon ionization of an atom in the state @xmath37 by a _ weak , monochromatic and spatially homogeneous laser field _ , without the relaxation of the intermediate levels . for @xmath314 , the @xmath161dependence of @xmath324 is displayed in figure  [ fig : power ] .",
    "this graph demonstrates that @xmath328 gradually decreases as the pulse energy increases and tends , for @xmath329 , to an almost constant value , @xmath330 , thus indicating on the presence of saturation in the 3photon transition considered .",
    "separation in muonium ; ( c ) - photoionization line profile measured in , versus laser frequency detuning , @xmath307 .",
    ", width=566,height=264 ]    finally , it should be mentioned that the above consideration has been developed mainly in the attempt to simulate those line profiles of the two ",
    "step 3photon ionization probabilities that are supposed to be measured soon in the new @xmath1 experimental investigation of muonium .",
    "essential physical parameters employed in this study are still not fixed completely and are subject to further changes .",
    "it is therefore rather tempting to apply our present technique to appropriate data formerly collected within the framework of the previously employed experimental setup  @xcite .",
    "these are shown in figures  [ fig5](a , b ) , along with the photoionization line profile obtained within the framework of the current theoretical approach , figure  [ fig5](c ) .",
    "the fact that the corresponding experimental line shape ( not shown ) is virtually indistinguishable from the theoretical one provides an additional and independent check of the overall validity of the model developed in this work .",
    "we have developed a simple theoretical scheme intended to describe , to the @xmath19 accuracy , the stepwise 3photon resonant photoionization in hydrogenic systems , induced by the chirped laser field with time ",
    "dependent amplitude .",
    "it has been shown that such an accuracy can be achieved within the framework of a simple 3-level model , by taking into account ( i ) the _ ac stark _ shifts and ( ii ) non - zero ionization rates of the levels involved , together with ( iii ) a spatial inhomogeneity of the laser signal and ( iv ) arbitrary @xmath101-dependencies of its intensity ( pulse envelope ) , @xmath331 , and frequency , @xmath31 . the system of equations ( [ ala2])-([cont ] ) or , equivalently , equations ( [ r2s])-([r_cont ] ) is a key point of the method employed .",
    "these are of independent significance as being not specifically restricted to particular states of reference , laser intensities , and chirps , so that the results obtained for @xmath332 and @xmath333states can be generalized on arbitrary @xmath334 levels of hydrogen  like atoms .",
    "excited @xmath335levels , such that @xmath336 , are of particular current interest for ultra - high precision laser spectroscopy , and it should be expected that an adequate interpretation of experimental data should require an accurate theoretical account of a wide spectrum of light  induced effects .",
    "some of these effects are beyond the scope of our present consideration and , in the first instance , comprise appropriate corrections due to inevitable motion of atoms in the media and associated _ second _ order doppler shifts , as being of major importance .",
    "indeed , even for cw lasers where the signals are usually almost unchirped in the laboratory frame , the amplitude and the frequency of the pulsed laser signals become essentially time  dependent in the atomic rest frame , thus leading , as was demonstrated above , to the shifts and distortions of ionization / excitation lines .",
    "the relative contribution of the effects discussed is estimated as @xmath337 with @xmath109 being the atomic velocity in the laboratory frame , and these should be incorporated in the theoretical scheme developed here , along with relativistic / radiative corrections @xmath338 to the operator of the particle  laser field interaction .",
    "this work is currently in progress , and we consider it as a subject of forthcoming publications .",
