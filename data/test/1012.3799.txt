    "in the absence of boundaries the incompressible navier - stokes equations are symmetric under rotations , translations and reflections .",
    "if we impose a subgroup of symmetries on the solutions we reduce the number of degrees of freedom in simulations of the flow . in the early days of numerical simulation such reduction by symmetry was used to probe into turbulent flow , revealing structures such as the taylor - green vortex @xcite .",
    "kida @xcite put forward what is probably the maximal reduction still allowing for turbulent flow .",
    "the corresponding flow is called _ high symmetric _ and was used to study flow statistics at moderate to high reynolds number @xcite .",
    "as computers have grown considerably since then , those results may be reproduced today in simulations without any special symmetry .",
    "however , reduction by symmetry can still be a useful approach when going to ever higher reynolds number , requiring higher resolution of the models , and when applying tools of dynamical systems theory to turbulence .",
    "recently considerable effort has been made to apply continuation and bifurcation analysis to fluid dynamical problems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "if this could be done at realistic resolution the results could prove a valuable complement to statistical analysis of direct numerical simulation . at the moment",
    "the maximum number of degrees of freedom tackled successfully is of order @xmath0 .",
    "given that the simulation of turbulent flow at moderate reynolds number requires a number of degrees of freedom in the order of @xmath1 , reduction by symmetry can be successfully applied .    here",
    ", we examine the transition from regular to weakly turbulent motion in high symmetric flow . exploiting the divergence free condition in addition to the symmetry we gain a factor of about @xmath2 with respect to general , non symmetric flow and a factor of @xmath3 with respect to earlier work on high symmetric flow in terms of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we can analyse the transition using continuation of periodic orbits and computation of lyapunov exponents , using the direct method for integration rather then the pseudo - spectral method .",
    "in addition to the ruelle - takens scenario , reported on previously @xcite , we find that a cascade of quasi - periodic doubling bifurcations , otherwise knows as torus doubling bifurcations , occurs in the transition to weak turbulence . to the author s best knowledge this is the first time this bifurcation sequence is found in navier - stokes flow at realistic truncation level . in order to relate the numerical results to theoretical predictions",
    "we propose a model ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for this cascade .",
    "in contrast to model equations studied previously @xcite these equations , based on a fixed time smooth suspension of the hnon map , display a complete cascade with a fixed frequency ratio of the bifurcating tori in the limit of a perturbation parameter to zero . if we introduce a slight perturbation in the model ode the bifurcation cascade is interrupted , as it is in the simulations of weak turbulence .",
    "also , the frequency spectrum at the onset of chaos and the dependence of the leading lyapunov exponents on the bifurcation parameter in the simulations is shown to be very similar those of the perturbed model ode .    to within the accuracy of the numerics ,",
    "the scaling of the cascade is shown to agree with that of the unperturbed model ode , which is known theoretically .",
    "when looking at the leading lyapunov exponents a difference becomes apparent : in the unperturbed model ode the largest two nonzero exponents become equal on an open interval in parameter space in between successive doubling bifurcation points , whereas in the perturbed model ode , and also in the flow simulations , they remain separate .",
    "this difference might by caused by the crossing of resonance tongues or other codimension one phenomena in which the stable torus loses normal hyperbolicity .",
    "a thorough study of the model ode with finite perturbation might yield an explanation .",

    "relations ( [ omega1]-[omega3 ] ) reduce the number of independent fourier modes of vorticity by a factor of @xmath21 in the leading order , that is @xmath22 .",
    "this reduction was exploited by kida @xcite to investigate scaling laws at moderate to high reynolds number . in the present work we exploit the divergence free condition for vorticity to further reduce the number of modes . with the aid of equation ( [ omega1 ] ) it reads @xmath23 taking maximal advantage of relations ( [ omega1]-[omega4 ] )",
    "we consider only fourier components of @xmath24 in the fundamental domain @xmath25 .",
    "the number of independent modes is reduced by a factor of @xmath26 in the leading order .",

    "thus we obtain a family of dynamical systems with one parameter , @xmath7 , and a number of degrees of freedom given by @xmath33",
    "in performing time integrations we avoid the use of a pseudo - spectral method , commonly employed for three dimensional simulations of navier - stokes . up to a truncation level of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) the direct method is not exceedingly slow due to the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom described above and yields easy access to the jacobian for integration of the variational equations .",
    "also , the direct integration code can easily be run in parallel , distributing the computation of the components of the vector field over any number of processors . for higher truncation levels",
    ", at which storage of the nonlinear interaction coefficients requires huge memory space , it is mandatory to use a pseudo spectral method , as described in @xcite , even though it does not exploit the divergence free condition ( [ omega4 ] ) . for time integration a seventh to eight order runge - kutta - felbergh scheme with adaptive step size",
    "is employed .",

    "the same estimate is obtained for the model ode . in the case of poincar maps , rather then discrete maps , similar deviations from the theory are found .    in figures [ exponents](left ) and [ susexponents](left ) the leading lyapunov exponents are shown as a function of the bifurcation parameter , i.e. the viscosity @xmath7 for the high - symmetric flow and the parameter @xmath108 of the hnon map for the model ode . from these data we can estimate the locus of the bifurcation points , stressing once more that this notion is ill - defined on a scale smaller then our resolution in parameter space . thus we find consecutive estimates for the scaling constant @xmath134 as @xmath135 or @xmath136 : @xmath137 again , this is compatible with the theory for period doubling cascades , albeit a rough estimate .    in figure [ exponents](right ) enlargements around the points @xmath124 and @xmath125 are shown for the high - symmetric flow simulations .",

    "for now we have no explanation for the absence of crossing or equal leading lyapunov exponents in between doubling points .",
    "as noted before , the invariant tori are structurally stable only on a fractal domain of the parameter and bifurcations might go unnoticed when monitoring lyapunov exponents with finite step size for the parameter .",
    "a more thorough understanding could be obtained by a continuation of the invariant torus itself and by further study of the model ode ( [ normform ] ) , which is the topic of future research .",

    "we observe four doublings after which quasi - periodic behaviour is very hard to distinguish from chaotic behaviour numerically . in previous work on the quasi - periodic doubling cascade , both numerical and experimental ,",
    "chaos is reported to set in after two or three doublings @xcite .",
    "the fact that we see more doublings might be due to the widely separate fundamental frequencies of the bifurcating tori in our system , as is the case in recent work by schilder _ et al_@xcite .    in order to make the notion of a quasi - periodic doubling cascade precise",
    "we have proposed a model ode , equations ( [ normform ] ) , such that in the limit of a perturbation parameter @xmath143 the correspondence to the periodic doubling cascade is exact .",
    "the scaling of the first steps of the observed quasi - periodic doubling cascade agrees with the prediction of the unperturbed equations ( [ normform ] ) .",
    "looking at the leading nonzero lyapunov exponents , however , a difference between the perturbed model ode and the high - symmetric flow simulations on one side , and the unperturbed model ode on the other side , becomes apparent . in the perturbed model ode and in the simulations",
    "the two largest nonzero exponents remain separate in between doublings , or at least no crossing is found with a small but finite step size in the parameter .",
    "an explanation might follow from a detailed study of the model ode ( [ normform ] ) with nonzero perturbation .",
    "other interesting questions would be if the scaling laws of the doubling cascade are influenced by the perturbation and how many steps of the cascade can be observed given the ratio of fundamental frequencies and the strength of the perturbation .",
    "the solutions presented here , in particular the bifurcating tori , are solutions of the truncated three dimensional navier - stokes equations on a periodic domain .",
    "they might , however , prove to be unstable to asymmetric perturbations .",
    "it is therefore uncertain whether the quasi - periodic doubling cascade can be observed in periodic flow without any symmetries imposed .",
    "it does , however , occur at low reynolds number , at which asymmetric perturbations might be damped .",
    "even at such low reynolds number , the simulation of general three dimensional flow , and the bifurcation analysis as presented here , remains a formidable task .",
