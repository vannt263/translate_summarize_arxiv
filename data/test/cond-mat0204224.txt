    "since the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) of the liquid - glass transition has been proposed in the mid - eighties @xcite , considerable work has been done in order to compare its predictions with experimental data and computer simulation results @xcite .",
    "most of these tests of the mct are based on the use as fitting functions of the quasi - universal laws that are obtained from an asymptotic analysis of the family of non - linear equations to which the mode - coupling equations belong and that are valid only in the vicinity of the predicted so - called ideal glass transition singularity . for experimental data , this is essentially the only practicable approach , since typical glass - formers are molecular liquids for which a first - principle study is out of reach and since most experiments , like dynamic light - scattering spectroscopy @xcite , probe complex mechanisms in which various types of dynamical processes are entangled . in the case of computer simulations , the situation appears more comfortable , since simple systems can be considered for which all the data needed for an extensive comparison with the theory can be directly obtained with high precision . however , it turns out that one still has to rely on asymptotic results of the theory at some point .",
    "indeed , one finds that the mct is not able to predict accurately the location of the putative ideal glass transition : it has thus to be determined from the simulation results , usually with a fit to an asymptotic law , in order to calibrate the comparison between theory and simulation @xcite .",
    "such a use of the asymptotic laws does not go without difficulties , originating in the fact that the ideal glass transition is never observed as such : it is usually argued to be avoided because of the existence of so - called `` activated processes '' not taken into account by the theory , whose effect is to restore the ergodicity of the system in the predicted ideal glassy state .",
    "thus the transition is expected to be replaced by a smooth crossover between two dynamical regimes , one dominated by the mode - coupling mechanism and the other dominated by activated processes .",
    "a first problem with the occurrence of these additional processes is that it hinders a clear separation of time scales between the fast transient dynamics and the structural relaxation , with which mct exclusively deals , and thus makes the domain where the asymptotic regime of mct is expected more difficult to resolve . in addition , the study of the corrections to the asymptotic laws shows that these laws are valid only in a very small domain around the ideal glass transition @xcite : it can thus be expected that the dynamics in this domain will be markedly affected by crossover effects .",
    "finally , from a more pragmatic point of view , since the asymptotic laws of the theory apply to rather specific aspects of the dynamics ( for instance , in the @xmath0 relaxation regime , since the shape of the relaxation itself is non - universal , the main quantitative asymptotic prediction deals with the variation of the relaxation time with temperature ) , only selected parts of the available experimental information are usually involved in most experimental tests of the mct on molecular glassformers , a situation which can be considered quite unsatisfactory . for these reasons",
    ", it appears desirable to have a means to test the mct on experimental data which is not limited to the use of the critical predictions of the theory and which is able to give an overall account of the dynamics .",
    "this can precisely be achieved within the so - called schematic approach to experimental data .",
    "schematic mode - coupling models are simple sets of mode - coupling equations retaining the essential non - linear structure of the equations of the mct in one or two equations and with only a few parameters .",
    "they played a major role in the development of the theory to investigate the universal properties of the general mode - coupling equations and to demonstrate the potentialities of the theory @xcite .",
    "recently , they have been found useful as quantitative models for numerical fits of experimental data covering a wide time or frequency range .",
    "the basic idea behind this schematic approach to experimental data is that , since all equations of the mode - coupling type share distinctive universal properties , meaningful informations are likely to be obtained if a suitable minimal set of equations of this family is used as an effective mode - coupling model to describe experimental data .",
    "one interest of the method is then that the universal properties of the mode - coupling equations are used in a milder sense than in their usual direct applications : it is thus possible to numerically take into account corrections to the asymptotic laws that can be important if the system is too far from its putative ideal glass transition .",
    "in addition , one can tentatively describe the full dynamics , including the non - universal @xmath0 relaxation and the fast transient dynamics ( although through rather crude approximations ) , and thus possibly overcome the problem of insufficient separation of time scales . for these reasons",
    ", the schematic approach appears as a method of choice to critically investigate the validity of the previous tests of the theory based on the asymptotic laws .",
    "of course , the power of the method comes at a price : even a minimal schematic model ( in a sense to be defined latter ) will have numerous adjustable parameters .",
    "this makes the approach numerically extremely flexible , and one finds for instance that it is possible to give an account of the experimental dynamics with an ideal mct schematic model even at low temperatures where ideal mct is known inadequate .",
    "thus one should not overestimate the physical meaning of the fitted parameters .",
    "however , as was found in previous works , by critically looking at the results of a schematic analysis , one can address from a renewed point of view the problem of testing the predictions of the mct on experimental data .    in the present paper , the third of a series devoted to the schematic approach to experimental data @xcite",
    ", we aim to address various issues that have been overlooked in previous works , in order to better settle and understand the principles and results of this approach . in the next section ,",
    "we give an overview of the schematic studies proposed so far and of the models on which they were based . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , a set of simple requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to define a suitable minimal schematic model is proposed . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we examine the influence of the choice of the schematic model on the results of the analysis of a given set of experimental data , and sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] is devoted to a tentative validation of the method , by analyzing model spectra with well defined properties within the schematic approach .",
    "we finally present our conclusions and draw perspectives for the approach .",
    "in this section , we give an overview of the schematic studies proposed so far .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to settle a few definitions and notations to be used latter .",
    "the first schematic study has been proposed by alba - simionesco and krauzman @xcite , where they analyzed low - frequency raman scattering spectra of the fragile glassformer metatoluidine with various two - correlator schematic models .",
    "one of them , based on the so - called f@xmath1 model @xcite , is defined by the equations    [ f12model ] @xmath2    with initial conditions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and has subsequently been used in studies of raman spectra of other glassformers @xcite and , more importantly , of depolarized light - scattering spectra of salol and ckn [ @xmath6 covering a wide frequency range ( more than four decades ) @xcite . in all these works , where other choices for the memory - function @xmath7 have occasionally been considered @xcite ,",
    "the fitting function was defined , up to an amplitude factor , as the susceptibility associated with the effective correlator @xmath8    another widely used model differs only from the preceding one through the choice @xmath9 an expression first proposed by sjgren @xcite , and the use as the fitting function of the susceptibility associated to @xmath10 , with an adjustable amplitude factor .",
    "it has been used to study depolarized light - scattering spectra of glycerol @xcite and orthoterphenyle ( otp ) @xcite , as well as coherent neutron - scattering and brillouin spectra of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "an extended mct version of this model has also been used recently to study depolarized light - scattering , dielectric - loss and incoherent neutron - scattering spectra of propylene carbonate @xcite .",
    "finally , self - intermediate scattering functions obtained by molecular dynamics simulations of a nickel - zirconium model have been analyzed by teichler @xcite with a single - correlator model with @xmath7 defined as @xmath12 at variance with the works mentioned above , a retarded damping term involving four adjustable parameters has been used in the present case instead of the simple markovian approximation made in eq .   involving the single parameter @xmath13 .",
    "looking at the equations , one sees that these models involve _ a priori _ a large number of fitting parameters . to reduce this number , simplifying assumptions",
    "are usually made : in refs .",
    ", , , and , the only temperature - dependent parameters are chosen to be @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas in ref .  , these are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and in ref .  , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 change with temperature , the latter depending also on the wave vector modulus",
    "in all schematic studies proposed so far , a certain degree of arbitrariness has often been involved in the choice of the details of the model to be used .",
    "the most serious case relates perhaps to the use of the memory function in our preceding works @xcite , which , at variance with sjgren s model@xcite , can not be given any precise theoretical foundations .",
    "but other minor choices can also be questioned .",
    "there is indeed no physical reason to prefer using a simple correlator as the fitting function instead of a composite one like in eq .  ,",
    "the apparent advantage of the former choice , which seems to make the relation between the fitting function and the dynamical variable probed by the experiment transparent , relying on a mere tautology .",
    "one can also wonder why , for similar experimental data and schematic equations , the effective vertex entering the second memory function ( @xmath17 or @xmath16 ) has been held constant with temperature in refs .   and and not in ref .",
    "for instance , where it is @xmath14 which has been kept fixed . in most cases ,",
    "these various choices have been only validated _ a posteriori _ by the success of the model to fit the data under study and/or the obtention of parameters whose variations match the expectations from the microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "there are nevertheless a few difficulties that could be expected , related to the possible existence of non - generic features of the chosen model . indeed , as stated in the introduction",
    ", generic mode - coupling equations display remarkable universal properties @xcite , but , when a schematic model is considered , because it is very simple , one can experience severe limitations in the realization of these universal features : certain values of important parameters of the theory can be unattainable or _ ad hoc _ correlations between these parameters can be imposed .",
    "an example of the first situation is provided by the f@xmath18 models , @xmath19 , for which @xmath20 is the only possible value of the exponent parameter @xmath21 , whereas it can take any value in the interval @xmath22 $ ] for the general mode - coupling equations .",
    "the second situation is realized with the f@xmath1 model , where the exponent parameter and the critical non - ergodicity parameter @xmath23 are always related through @xmath24 .    for these reasons",
    ", it seems desirable to understand what are the minimal requirements that must be met by a schematic model in order to avoid such biases and possible consequent inconsistencies in the results of its application .",
    "we propose here a series of criteria based on a discussion of the asymptotic properties of the mode - coupling equations in the vicinity of the ideal glass transition .",
    "for this , we consider the case of an experiment probing the evolution of a normalized correlation function @xmath25 associated to an unspecified dynamical process in a given glassforming liquid , when a thermodynamic parameter @xmath26 ( temperature or density for instance ) is varied .",
    "note that the following discussion can easily be extended to situations where more than one observable are considered in a unified framework @xcite , with exactly the same conclusions .    by looking at the asymptotic predictions of the theory @xcite , a few important parameters emerge . on the one hand",
    ", one finds parameters that characterize the liquid under study and the thermodynamic path along which the experiment is performed .",
    "these are @xmath27 , the value of @xmath26 at the ideal glass transition , @xmath28 , the proportionality constant relating the separation parameter @xmath29 defined by the theory to @xmath26 through the relation @xmath30 and @xmath21 , the exponent parameter governing numerous aspects of the critical dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", one finds parameters that are specific to the correlation function @xmath25 : @xmath31 , the non - ergodicity parameter at the transition , and @xmath32 , the so - called critical amplitude .",
    "thus we identify five parameters that are expected to be of special relevance .",
    "the first three of them are involved in the description of the relative evolution of the two characteristic time scales of the dynamics in the ergodic phase , @xmath33 and @xmath34 characterizing the @xmath35 regime and the @xmath0 relaxation respectively",
    ". this can be seen from the ratio @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are uniquely determined by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 alone determines the shape of the dynamics in the @xmath35 regime .",
    "the two remaining parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are related to the amplitudes of the @xmath0 relaxation and of the @xmath35 process , as shown for instance by the scaling relation @xmath39 describing the @xmath35 process and the onset of @xmath0 relaxation in the ergodic phase close to the singularity .",
    "but in fact , this parameter counting is only valid when the full mode - coupling equations describing the dynamics of the system are known .",
    "two differences appear when the only available information is the function @xmath25 at different @xmath26 values .",
    "first , it can be seen that @xmath32 never appears alone in the asymptotic laws , but always inside products @xmath40 .",
    "for this reason , the relevant parameter is rather the physical amplitude @xmath41 , which appears for instance in the relation between @xmath26 and the non - ergodicity parameter in the ideal glassy state , @xmath42 this remark would be irrelevant if it was possible to know @xmath28 from the data at hand , but this is not the case . indeed , according to the theory , the shape of the @xmath0 relaxation is non - universal .",
    "this means that there exists an undetermined proportionality constant relating @xmath34 , the value emerging from the theoretical calculation , to the phenomenological @xmath0 relaxation time @xmath43 , which can be defined for instance after @xmath44 and which is the only type of value that can be accessed from the knowledge of @xmath25 alone .",
    "such a problem does not occur for the @xmath35 process which is universal , i.e. it depends only on @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the ratio can only be known up to an undetermined factor and thus that the value of @xmath28 can not be obtained .",
    "this is in fact an important result , since it shows that one can know the absolute distance ( in terms of the separation parameter @xmath29 ) of a system to its ideal glass transition only if the mode - coupling equations describing the full dynamics are known .",
    "moving now back to the schematic approach to experimental data , one finds thus that , in order to analyze the evolution of the correlation function @xmath25 with an effective schematic correlator @xmath45 , the model must be able to reproduce the values of @xmath21 , @xmath31 and @xmath46 characterizing the system and the observable under investigation .",
    "a point on the transition surface of the schematic model must exist where one will have @xmath47 the last equality is not a strong constraint since @xmath48 and @xmath49 relate to decoupled aspects of the description of the dynamics , the first one being defined at the transition point , whereas the second one describes the approach of this point .",
    "one can thus expect that the interplay of these two aspects will allow to compensate possible non - generic features relative to @xmath48 ( like in the case of the f@xmath1 model where @xmath50 ) .",
    "the first two constraints are on the contrary very strong and need to be taken into account .",
    "one has in particular to worry about the accessible domain for the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 and to avoid the introduction of arbitrary correlations between these parameters .",
    "eventually , one finds thus that a schematic model needs to have at least three adjustable coupling constants , at least one of them changing with temperature .",
    "indeed , with a single coupling constant , only one pair ( @xmath51,@xmath52 ) is possible . with two coupling constants , a relation linking @xmath51 and @xmath52 exists , and for a given value of @xmath51",
    ", only a finite number of @xmath52 values will exist .",
    "one needs three coupling parameters to be able to decouple @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can now look at the schematic models introduced in the previous section at the light of these new results .",
    "it is easy to see that these conditions are matched by the model used in ref .   and",
    "defined by eqs .   and , since it relies on four coupling parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath53 ) to obtain the values of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is not the case of the model used by teichler @xcite , which has only two coupling parameters @xmath53 and @xmath55 , and one indeed finds inconsistencies in the results : for instance , the exponent parameter @xmath21 appears to change with the considered observable .",
    "it seems thus likely that the success of the calculation is essentially to be credited to the flexibility of the fitting procedure ( in particular through the choice of a four - parameter retarded friction ) and to the consideration of observables with high plateau values which probably turn out to be compatible with the value of the real exponent parameter .",
    "about the other studies , one finds in fact that the present discussion is inoperant , because only part of the dynamics is considered : the @xmath0 relaxation is not present in refs .   and , and the fast transient dynamics is not included in refs .  , , and , with the effect of releasing in both cases the constraint on the value of @xmath52 .",
    "an interesting consequence of these constraints is that they restrain the possibility to give a precise physical meaning to the separate components of a schematic model .",
    "this is especially clear when a composite correlator like eq .",
    "indeed , the relations between the components of the fitting function are expected to be mainly imposed by the need to reproduce the values of @xmath21 , @xmath31 and @xmath46 : it is then hardly conceivable that the value of the coupling constant @xmath53 or the effect of the details of the expression for @xmath45 will reflect any physical reality , for instance in terms of the light scattering mechanism .",
    "this is of course less obvious when the fitting function is a pure correlator , because of the tautological relation between the fitting function and the dynamical variable probed by the experiment , but , for the previous reasons , we believe that in general a schematic model has to be considered in its globality as a minimal phenomenological model allowing to give an account of the dynamics of a system in terms of mode - coupling effects , and nothing more has to be expected from it .",
    "to conclude this part , it is worth stressing that the present discussion refers only to the asymptotic predictions of the theory and that problems originating in pre - asymptotic corrections or the existence of activated processes have been ignored .",
    "moreover , only a few numbers have been considered . in particular , the precise shape of the relaxation ( particularly in the @xmath0 relaxation domain ) has not been taken into account , whereas it can make an _ a priori _ well - suited model totally inefficient for the schematic approach .",
    "for these reasons , the preceding remarks are only guidelines aimed at rationalizing and optimizing the use of schematic models , but they offer no guarantee of success .",
    "in the present section , we propose a study of depolarized light - scattering spectra of a fragile glassformer by means of a variety of schematic models .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , in all previous schematic analysis , only one model has ever been used at a time for a given set of experiments and no systematic investigation of the influence of the choice of the model on the results has been proposed so far . secondly , in the previous section ,",
    "a few parameters have been isolated that are expected to play a special role in the description of the dynamics of a given observable .",
    "the use of different schematic models to analyze the same set of experimental data , depending of their ability to provide consistent estimates for these values , should thus allow us to confirm or infirm the corresponding discussion .",
    "the data we have studied are the ckn depolarized light - scattering spectra measured by cummins _",
    "_ @xcite and already analyzed with a schematic model in ref .  .",
    "the reason ckn has been chosen ( and not salol for instance ) for this study is the low intensity of its @xmath0 peak , which is slightly smaller than the microscopic peak : this guarantees that , when the spectra are studied with a composite effective correlator like in eq .",
    ", the amplitudes of the contributions of both terms will not be too different and thus this allows one to obtain a better contrast between the outcome of different schematic analysis . to limit the influence of the avoidance of the ideal glass transition , only rather high temperatures , between 383 and 468 k ,",
    "have been considered .",
    "compared to our previous work , the two lower temperatures ( 363 and 373 k ) have been excluded , leading to small differences in the results ( within the error bars of the method ) . note that at the temperatures we have considered , one can expect the spectra to be free of the influence of the spurious experimental artifacts evidenced in ref .  .",
    "only schematic models closely related to the one used in ref .   and with the same number of parameters have been considered . as in this previous work , they have been used to perform simultaneous fits of the experimental data at the nine selected temperatures : the whole dynamical scenario developing as temperature varies is thus encoded in the only temperature dependent parameters of the schematic models , which are the effective vertices entering in the expression of the memory function @xmath7 .",
    "we first stick to the two - correlator f@xmath1 model .",
    "there are two routes by which the model can be modified . on the one hand",
    ", different second memory functions can be chosen .",
    "we have considered two cases :    [ varmem1 ] @xmath56    on the other hand , one can vary the expression of the effective correlator as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have considered four possibilities :    [ varcorreff ] @xmath58    in previous works @xcite , the choice of a specific expression was originally motivated by assumptions on the light - scattering mechanism . however , from the discussion of the preceding section , it seems very unlikely that this question is of any relevance : indeed , since individually each correlator has no real physical meaning , the precise way it enters the calculation is clearly unimportant .    *",

    "the reader is referred to previous work for a discussion of the consequences of this observation @xcite .",

    "we attribute this qualitative difference between the two models to the way the temperature dependence is entered in the schematic model at the level of the second memory function @xmath59 . indeed , at a given point @xmath63 of the ergodic domain , one can qualitatively quantify the strength of the mode - coupling term in eq .",
    ", @xmath64 , by considering the value of @xmath59 for representative values @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the correlation functions @xmath57 and @xmath10 , respectively @xcite . when eq .",

    "is used with constant @xmath17 , the factor @xmath68 shows an additional _ explicit _ temperature dependence , since @xmath59 is defined directly in terms of the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and in fact this explicit dependence dominates the implicit one .",
    "if one now compares the evolution of these factors for both models when one explores the @xmath63 plane , one easily finds that , in order to have similar increases in the strength of the mode - coupling terms , one has to consider trajectories in the case of sjgren s model that lie above the corresponding trajectories for eq .   and that come rather close to the transition line , since in its vicinity only are found significant increases in @xmath65 and @xmath66 , hence the difference in the results obtained with these two models : the catastrophic behavior of the vertices due to the avoidance of the transition is less visible in the case of sjgren s model , because it is by construction already constrained to follow rather closely the transition line .",
    "once this subtle non - generic feature has been recognized , one is able to rationalize the similarities and differences between the results of the various schematic analysis proposed so far .",
    "since the light - scattering spectra of glycerol have been analyzed with the same parameterization of sjgren s model as the one used here for model v and vi , it is no surprise that the trajectory found by franosch _",
    "@xcite is similar to those obtained here with these two models .",
    "this is the case of the study of @xmath11 as well , despite the choice of a temperature - dependent @xmath16 : above @xmath69 , the numerical fits result in a slow increase of this parameter when temperature is decreased , which converts , as one would expect , to a trajectory in the @xmath63 plane that is not different from what is obtained when @xmath16 is taken constant @xcite .",
    "the case of otp provides another illustration of this point @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this work , the relative position of the vertex trajectory and the transition line is imposed from the start through the choice of a temperature - independent @xmath14 , a constraint that is compatible with the results obtained above for models i to iv , and , as could be anticipated from the previous discussion , this coincides with a rapidly increasing @xmath16 when temperature is decreased , i.e. a strong explicit temperature - dependence of the second memory function . the same seems to hold for the extended mode - coupling analysis of gtze and voigtmann @xcite , where a neat intersection of the ideal glass transition line by the trajectory in the parameter space of the schematic model is associated with values of @xmath16 increasing rapidly with decreasing temperature .",
    "these observations appear at first sight rather anecdotic .",
    "they have nevertheless at least one important physical implication . indeed , comparing the results for glycerol and @xmath11 , two liquids with intermediate fragility , to those for salol , ckn , and otp , that are all very fragile",
    ", it is tempting to propose a connection between the fragility of a glassformer and the shape of the effective vertex trajectory that describes its dynamics .",
    "the previous discussion rules out such a tentative connection and shows that the analogies and differences found between the various fluids simply originate in the details of the implementation of the schematic approach .",
    "we now turn to the quantitative analysis of our results . for each schematic model ,",
    "the values of the various parameters characterizing the ideal glass transition have been obtained by extrapolation of the linear dependence of the effective vertices with temperature at high temperature , which we have identified as the signature of the domain where the ideal mct is adequate ( in the next section , support will be given to this analysis that differs from the one used in refs .   and ) .",
    "they are reported in table [ globalt ] .",
    "all six models provide consistent estimates for @xmath69 , @xmath21 , @xmath61 and @xmath54 .",
    "this consistency tends to validate the discussion proposed in the previous section about the relevant variables to describe a given observable in terms of mode - coupling parameters .",
    "this is clearly a non - trivial observation , since the values of the different parameters entering the calculation vary notably from one model to another ( for instance , @xmath70 changes by a factor of two between model iii and v ) .    in order to investigate stronger changes to the schematic model ,",
    "we have considered other memory functions @xmath7 , keeping @xmath71 as in .",
    "one of the most studied schematic models after f@xmath1 is f@xmath72 defined as @xcite @xmath73 we have studied two models based on this memory function .",
    "they will be denoted i and iv , since they are directly analogous to the preceding i and iv f@xmath1 models .",
    "we observe a clear deterioration of the quality of the fits compared to f@xmath1 , but it remains nevertheless acceptable ( see fig .",
    "[ fitexp ] ) .",
    "in fact , the use of the f@xmath72 model is made difficult by one of its non - generic properties .",
    "indeed , when a b - transition line has a termination point or when two transition lines meet , strong corrections to the generic asymptotic laws appear and noticeably affect the shape of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "these corrections can make it impossible to use a schematic model to fit experimental data if the description of the system under study requires to come close to such singularities . in the f@xmath1 model , a termination point",
    "is found at @xmath74 , but here @xmath75 , which is quite far from the values characterizing the typical glassformers , of the order of 0.7 .",
    "thus no problem has to be expected _ a priori_. but in the f@xmath72 model , one finds that the a- and b - transition lines meet when @xmath76 , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",

    "the behavior of the effective vertices is the same as with f@xmath1 , but slightly less regular .",
    "critical parameters have been obtained from high temperatures as before .",
    "the agreement with the previous results for the values of @xmath69 and @xmath61 is very good , but less good for the values of @xmath21 and @xmath54 .",
    "however one can hardly conclude from these results , since these parameters characterize the @xmath35 process , in which the non - generic limitations of the f@xmath72 model precisely show up .    as it was stressed in the previous section ,",
    "when using the schematic approach to experimental data , one has to avoid any arbitrary correlation between important parameters of the theory introduced in an _ ad hoc _ way by the choice of a specific schematic model . in all models studied so far",
    ", one can identify such a correlation in the fact that , along the b type transition line , an increase of @xmath23 is systematically associated to a decrease of @xmath21 .",
    "this could have introduced a bias in the schematic calculation that would have made the avoidance of the ideal glass transition line a purely numerical artifact of the method . indeed , despite the absence of a true ergodicity breaking at @xmath69 in real systems , one expects that the increase of the non - ergodicity parameter below @xmath69 survives under the form of an increase of the @xmath0 peak height of the susceptibility .",
    "the vertex drift found with the f@xmath1 model could thus be simply traced back to the need to give an account of this evolution , the obtained trajectories corresponding precisely to an increase of @xmath23 ( and thus of @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "it would then reflect a misconception and limitation of the schematic approach itself and not more generally a failure of the underlying ideal mct as it was argued in ref .",
    "15 .    to show that our calculations are indeed free of this artifact",
    ", we have investigated a model in which the variations of @xmath21 and @xmath23 can be decoupled .",
    "we chose the f@xmath79 model , the transition line of which is made of two branches along which @xmath21 varies between @xmath20 and 1 : between the points @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 grow simultaneously , whereas between the points @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath21 decreases and @xmath23 increases .",
    "clearly , we have chosen this somewhat far - fetched model only for its mathematical properties and one could hardly give any physical motivation for the specific f@xmath79 functional form .",
    "however , we stress that , from the point of view of the criteria of the preceding section , this model is _ a priori _ free from any non - generic features and thus a perfectly acceptable schematic model : first , it does not show any limitation on the accessible values of @xmath21 , at variance with all other f@xmath86 different from f@xmath1 ; secondly , in the domain of @xmath21 we are interested in ( around 0.7 ) , the influence of the higher - order a@xmath87 singularity from which its special mathematical features originate is expected to be negligible .",
    "we have performed schematic analysis with this model in the vicinity of each branch of the transition line , in an attempt to find if the coupling of the evolutions of @xmath21 and @xmath23 plays any role in our calculations .",
    "the corresponding fits are quite poor : they only give a qualitative account of the evolution of the dynamics and it would seem unreasonable to extract quantitative values for the critical parameters of the theory from the results",
    ". however , a clear pattern manifests itself : close to both transition branches , the behavior of the effective vertices corresponds to a decrease of the exponent parameter , irrespective of the evolution of @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , this could have been anticipated from the fact that , below the value of @xmath69 we have determined , the maximum of the @xmath0 peak lies outside the available frequency window , and this eliminates the requirement to reproduce its amplitude at these low temperatures .",
    "however it is reassuring to show by an independent calculation that our results are free from this potential bias , that should certainly be taken into account if data where available on a wider frequency range .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown in this section that different schematic models applied to a same set of experimental data provide qualitatively similar results .",
    "we have found that they are in good quantitative agreement for the determination of the values of the parameters that have been distinguished in the previous section , provided no non - generic features , the importance of which has been emphasized for the f@xmath72 model , interfere with their determination .",
    "in the previous section , we have tried to validate the schematic approach and its results showing that different models provide consistent results when applied to a same set of experimental data . however , on various aspects , this study is not quite satisfactory . indeed , despite favorable indications gained from the use of the f@xmath79 model , the meaningfulness of the anomalous behavior of the effective vertices at low temperature remains to be assessed . in our previous work @xcite , it has been attributed to the existence of relaxation processes that are not taken into account in the ideal mct and that make it impossible to describe consistently the dynamics of the studied systems with a schematic model based on this theory . to strengthen this point of view",
    ", it would be necessary to show that the schematic approach is actually able to give an account of a complex purely mode - coupling dynamics with smoothly varying fitting parameters , despite of the extreme simplicity of the schematic equations compared to the complexity of the equations of the original problem .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to analyze data for which the values of the essential parameters @xmath21 , @xmath31 et @xmath46 are known in advance , in order to check to what extent the schematic approach is able to provide quantitative estimates for them .    a possibility to perform such",
    "a test is to calculate series of curves from mode - coupling equations known in advance and to analyze them as one would do for any set of experimental data .",
    "it remains then to compare the results obtained within the schematic approach with the properties that can be directly determined from the starting equations .",
    "we report the results of such a test in the present section .",
    "recently , franosch _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a detailed study of the mct predictions for the collective dynamics of a simple liquid , with special emphasis on the asymptotic laws valid in the vicinity of the ideal glass transition and their corrections @xcite .",
    "because their model has been very well and extensively characterized , it appears clearly as the model of choice to be the basis of the present evaluation of the schematic approach . besides it has already been used in a similar spirit for a critical study of the method consisting of the use of numerical fits of the @xmath35 correlator for experimental tests of the mct @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the mode - coupling equations for the brownian dynamics of the hard - sphere fluid with particle diameter @xmath88 , the thermodynamic state of which is determined by a single parameter , the compacity @xmath89 , related to the number density @xmath90 through the relation @xmath91 .",

    "the equations have been solved following the algorithm described in ref .",
    ", then the associated susceptibilities have been computed by fourier transform using filon s algorithm .",
    "we concentrate on the susceptibilities , for which it has been shown that the range of validity of the asymptotic laws is usually smaller than for the corresponding correlation functions @xcite , in order to be as close as possible to the situations in which the schematic approach is usually applied to experimental data .",
    "five values of the compacity such that the distances to the ideal glass transition are @xmath120 have been considered .",
    "larger @xmath121 values have been excluded , since they would correspond to spectra covering a much wider frequency range compared to the experimental situation .",
    "we have analyzed spectra for three values of the wave vector modulus : @xmath122 , corresponding to the main peak of the structure factor , @xmath123 , corresponding to the first minimum after the main peak , and @xmath124 , where certain pre - asymptotic corrections seem to be rather small .",
    "having now our reference spectra to be used as input like experimental data would be , each series of curves at a given @xmath125 value has been fitted with the two correlator f@xmath1 model referred to as model iv in the previous section . for compatibility reasons , no inertial term",
    "is included , i.e. one has @xmath126 note that an inertial term would be required both in the microscopic theory and in a schematic model to study a molecular glassformer , the dynamics of which is newtonian , and to reproduce its oscillatory dynamics in the raman band or in the boson - peak region .",
    "however , for the goal we wish to achieve here , i.e.  an assessment of the shape of the vertex trajectory and the calculation of the critical parameters of the theory from model theoretical spectra , the fact that it has been consistently omitted in the original model and in the schematic equations is irrelevant .",
    "no amplitude factor is needed , since the data are already normalized ( to check this point , a few calculations have been done with such a factor , showing that it remains equal to 1 ) .",
    "as above , only the effective vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are allowed to vary with @xmath127 .",
    "this means in particular that constant values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are imposed , despite the fact that the @xmath95 values of the original equations actually change with compacity through @xmath98 .",
    "the quality of the fits is good , comparable to what is obtained when experimental light - scattering spectra are analyzed , as illustrated in fig .  [ fiths ] .",

    "to each series of curves corresponds a different set of effective vertices , stressing the fact that the study of a single observable is not enough to give an unequivocal account of the dynamics of the system . here again , this is a consequence of the non - universality of the @xmath0 relaxation as described in the mct framework .",
    "the important observation is that the behavior of the effective vertices is perfectly regular : @xmath14 and @xmath15 are approximately linear with @xmath135 ( and thus @xmath14 is linear with @xmath15 ) .",
    "nothing similar to what has been found with experimental data close to the transition line shows up in the results .",
    "this tends to confirm the assumption that the anomalous behavior found from experiments and attributed to the avoidance of the ideal glass transition is not connected to a technical limitation of the schematic approach , but actually , at a more fundamental level , to the inadequateness of ideal mct in a temperature domain starting noticeably above the extrapolated ideal glass transition point .",
    "we can now determine the critical parameter values by extrapolating the linear behavior we have found and compare the results with those obtained directly from the original equations , in order to see if the procedure we have used previously is meaningful and if the corresponding results are quantitative .",
    "the values are reported in table  [ hstab ] .",
    "of the three parameters whose importance has been stressed in section  [ sec3 ] , @xmath131 is clearly the one for which the agreement between the original value and the schematic calculation is the best .",
    "the determination of @xmath134 is less precise but remains satisfactory . on the contrary ,",
    "a notable disagreement on the value of the crucial exponent parameter @xmath21 is found .",
    "the difference we find is significant and shows unambiguously that the schematic approach does not allow _ a priori _ to obtain the exact value of the exponent parameter , at least when the studied dynamics only covers a frequency range of the order of four or five decades . from this point of view",
    ", the schematic approach suffers from the same difficulties as the use of the @xmath35 correlator , which has been shown not to be able to give the value of @xmath21 in the same conditions @xcite .",
    "it has however to be stressed that , even if it is not perfect , the schematic approach turns out to perform much better than the latter approach .",
    "surprisingly , it is found that the three series of curves do not provide values scattered around the exact value @xmath136 , but instead , the same underestimated value is consistently found at all three wave numbers .",
    "it seems thus very likely that no improvement would be obtained if the three observables were analyzed in a unified framework , in the spirit of the most recent schematic calculations @xcite .    the origin of the present problem is strictly connected to the existence in the analyzed data of corrections to the asymptotic behavior predicted by the theory and not to a deficiency of the schematic approach .",
    "indeed , when spectra corresponding to larger values of @xmath121 ( i.e. corresponding to compacity values closer to the critical one ) are analyzed , a slight change in the behavior of the effective vertices occurs around @xmath137 and the trajectory described in the @xmath63 plane bends to indicate the point of the transition line corresponding to the correct value of @xmath21 .",
    "we stress , to avoid any ambiguity , that this change of behavior has nothing to do with the one found from experimental data : its amplitude is very small and it occurs in a domain where the points representative of the system in the @xmath63 plane are extremely close to the ideal glass transition line , meaning that the dynamics spreads over more than eight decades in frequency and corresponding for a real glassformer like ckn to a regime where the behavior of the effective vertices is already strongly affected by the existence of activated processes .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a detailed study of the schematic mode - coupling approach to experimental data .",
    "our aim was twofold .",
    "first , we wanted to settle the whole approach on firmer theoretical grounds , through a better understanding of the parameterization it involves and a clarification of the nature of the results it can provide .",
    "indeed , the schematic approach involves a certain degree of arbitrariness in the choice of the models to be used and the introduction of numerous adjustable parameters , which are never considered as good things when it comes to testing a theory .",
    "thus in order to credibilize the whole approach , one has to address these _ a priori _ problematic issues and show that they are actually harmless . hence this investigation ,",
    "whose outcome is the formulation of simple rules that need to be taken into account in order to define minimal schematic models suitable for use in this context and the isolation of a few parameters which are particularly relevant for the description of the dynamics and for which the schematic approach should provide estimates . following these criteria",
    ", it turns out that most previous schematic studies are based on well designed schematic models and use parameterizations which are close to the minimal one , in particular by letting only effective vertices vary with temperature .    secondly , our goal was a validation of the approach , through the investigation of its robustness and of its potential quantitative character by a variety of numerical tests .",
    "the results are rather satisfactory .",
    "indeed , we have been able to validate the results obtained in ref .   and the way they were analyzed .",
    "we have shown that they have a limited , if any , dependency in the schematic model we use and we have been able to identify and rule out many potential biases that could have affected our results .",
    "most properties of the dynamics whose relevance have been emphasized in the theoretical discussion of the approach appear to be quantitatively evaluated , with the notable exception of the exponent parameter @xmath21 , for which the method is not too bad , but still far from perfect .",
    "it has thus to be stressed that the precise and unambiguous determination of this parameter , which actually plays a very important role in the theory , remains elusive , by any of the methods that are available so far : all calculations indeed seem to be too sensitive to the presence of significant pre - asymptotic corrections ( as is shown here or , in the case of the use of the @xmath35 correlator , by ref .  ) and very probably to the existence of crossover effects due to the non - ideal behavior of real and simulated glassformers @xcite .    in conclusion , we believe that the present work paves the way to new applications of the schematic approach .",
    "indeed , the interest of the method to analyze experimental data has been emphasized in all previous works and we think its relevance has been further strengthened here .",
    "however , at this level , it was only a kind of simple phenomenological mode - coupling approach and the main issue was its ability to consistently describe a set of experimental data with a simple model .",
    "now , from our results , it seems possible to go one step further and to use this approach as an effective means to obtain precise estimates of transition temperatures , non - ergodicity parameters and critical amplitudes to be used for instance in quantitative tests of the mct on simple systems that are amenable to a full first - principle treatment .",
