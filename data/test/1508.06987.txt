    "the most common collective excitation in nuclei corresponds to a rotation about the principal axis of the density distribution with the largest moment of inertia .",
    "the substantial deformation of the overall density distribution specifies the orientation of the nucleus and , thus , the rotational degree of freedom . in this picture ,",
    "nuclear rotation is collective and results from a coherent motion of many nucleons  @xcite .",
    "however , since the nucleons which form a nucleus carry a quantized amount of angular momentum , the interplay between single - nucleon and collective motions is important in describing actual rotational excitations  @xcite . moreover , such interplay leads to a variety of new phenomena according to the discrete symmetries obtained by combining the overall - deformation and the single - nucleon angular momentum vectors  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in axially deformed nuclei , the coupling between the collective angular momentum and several valence holes usually results in the high-@xmath2 bands as the collective angular momentum increases , and this gives rise to well - known @xmath2 isomerism  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a triaxial nucleus allows more degrees of freedom for the coupling between collective and single - nucleon motions and , thus , is responsible for many new interesting modes such as nuclear chirality  @xcite , or longitudinal and transverse wobbling  @xcite .",
    "the situation for nearly spherical nuclei , however , is quite novel , since here collective rotation could be very weak due to the small deformation , while the valence nucleons play a crucial role in the generation of angular momentum .",
    "the so - called magnetic and antimagnetic rotations are two typical examples as they are attributed to the gradual alignment of two angular momentum vectors of valence particles and/or holes with a specific orientation  @xcite . for magnetic rotation , the energy and the angular momentum increase in terms of the shears mechanism ; i.e. , the alignment of the high-@xmath3 proton and neutron angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "the antimagnetic rotation , however , corresponds to the so - called `` two - shears - like mechanism '' ; i.e. , the two blades of protons or neutrons are aligned back to back at the bandhead , and then simultaneously close with respect to each other while generating the total angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the two novel magnetic and antimagnetic rotation modes can coexist in the same nucleus  @xcite .",
    "since magnetic and antimagnetic rotations were proposed , lots of effort have been made to understand these new phenomena and explore this manifestation throughout the nuclear chart  @xcite .",
    "up to now , more than 200 magnetic rotational bands spread in the mass regions of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  @xcite have been identified , while the antimagnetic rotational bands have been observed mainly in cd isotopes including @xmath9cd  @xcite , @xmath10cd  @xcite , @xmath11cd  @xcite , @xmath12cd  @xcite , @xmath13cd  @xcite , @xmath14cd  @xcite and , very recently , in @xmath15pd  @xcite , @xmath16pd  @xcite and @xmath17eu  @xcite . despite this evidence",
    ", it is found that pure magnetic and antimagnetic rotations are hardly realized in real nuclei . in most of the observations ,",
    "the contribution from a collective rotation mode is not negligible , and it always impacts the magnetic or antimagnetic rotation modes .",
    "in particular , for an antimagnetic rotation , the rotational states are connected by @xmath18 transitions only and the rotational axis is always along one of the principal axes , and such features are also expected for a collective rotation .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the interplay between antimagnetic and collective rotations is important for a suitable description of observed antimagnetic rotational bands .",
    "one of the most widely used models is a simple phenomenological one  @xcite , where the competition between the two - shears - like mechanism and core rotation has been investigated , based on simple angular momentum geometry to be fitted to the data .",
    "it is evident that a full understanding requires self - consistent microscopic investigations including all relevant degrees of freedom while based on reliable theories without additional parameters .",
    "such calculations are feasible in the framework of cranking density functional theories ( dfts ) .",
    "in particular , the tilted axis cranking dfts can explicitly construct the angular momentum vector diagrams showing the `` two - shears - like mechanism '' , which is of great help in visualizing the structure of antimagnetic rotational bands .",
    "recently , the tilted axis cranking covariant dft  @xcite has successfully provided the first fully self - consistent and microscopic investigation of antimagnetic rotation  @xcite .",
    "note that the tilted axis cranking covariant dft is not limited only to the description of antimagnetic rotation .",
    "it has been applied equally well to magnetic rotation  @xcite , high-@xmath2 bands  @xcite , rotations with an exotic rod shape  @xcite , etc .    despite recent experimental and theoretical efforts ,",
    "the study of antimagnetic rotation in the @xmath4 mass region is still sparse .",
    "using heavy - ion induced fusion - evaporation reaction at gammasphere  @xcite , the newly observed high - spin states in the nucleus @xmath0fe provide an opportunity to investigate antimagnetic rotation in a light system . note that in the previous study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of a magnetic rotational band had been suggested based on the tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theory ( tac - cdft ) with the configuration @xmath19 $ ]  @xcite , where two @xmath20 proton holes are aligned .",
    "if these two @xmath20 proton holes are paired , it is easy to form the high-@xmath3 configuration and the angular momentum arrangement for antimagnetic rotation . in this work",
    ", we will search for the possible existence of antimagnetic rotation in @xmath0fe .",
    "we are focusing on bands 3 and 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are @xmath21 sequences .",
    "band 3 has negative parity , has been seen in the @xmath22-@xmath23 range above a 5 mev excitation energy and band 4 has positive - parity , a @xmath24-@xmath25 range above 8 mev excitation energy .",
    "the level schemes , the relation between the rotational frequency and the angular momentum as well as the dynamic @xmath26 moment of inertia are calculated and compared with the available data .",
    "moreover , the interplay between the antimagnetic and collective modes will be discussed in details through the two - shears - like mechanism , the electromagnetic transition strengths @xmath1 and the @xmath27 ratios .",

    "the dirac equation is solved in a set of three dimensional harmonic oscillator bases with 10 major shells .",
    "the point - coupling density functional pc - pk1  @xcite is adopted , while the pairing correlations are neglected .",
    "the self - consistent rotational angle is determined by requiring that @xmath32 is parallel with @xmath33 at fixed @xmath34 . for antimagnetic rotation ,",
    "this automatically leads to zero rotational angle ; i.e. , the rotational axis points always along the @xmath35 axis .    for fe isotopes , the proton holes in the @xmath20 orbital and the neutron particles in the @xmath36 orbital could form the matched high-@xmath3 configurations for antimagnetic rotation . in the present tac - cdft calculation , we adopt the valence nucleon configuration @xmath19 $ ] for band 3 , and the configuration @xmath37 $ ] for band 4 , where two @xmath20 proton holes are paired .",
    "this configuration assignment is consistent with that proposed in the previous work  @xcite , but in the latter the two @xmath20 proton holes for band 4 are not fully paired . for simplicity",

    "[ figocc](a ) , for the ground state , there are two paired proton holes sitting at the top of the @xmath20 shell , and four paired @xmath42 neutrons above the @xmath43 shell , and this configuration is associated with a triaxial deformation with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then , we start to rotate the nucleus , and thus the time - reversal symmetry is violated by the coriolis term in the dirac equation , which leads to an energy splitting of the time - reversal conjugate states with an amplitude up to 1.75 mev at @xmath40 mev .",

    "the two proton angular momentum vectors @xmath64 are pointing opposite to each other , and they are nearly perpendicular to the neutron angular momentum vector @xmath65 for both configurations . together with @xmath65 , they form the blades of the two shears . with increasing rotational frequency , the gradual alignment of the vectors @xmath64 toward the vector @xmath65 generates partially the total angular momentum , and this corresponds to the so - called `` two - shears - like mechanism '' , where the two shears are closing simultaneously . on the other hand , it should be noted that the increase of the neutron angular momentum also contributes notably to the generation of the total angular momentum along the bands . in particular for the config 2 band , the neutron angular momentum jumps by more than @xmath67 when the rotational frequency increases from 0.2 mev to 1.1 mev , while the alignment of the two proton holes only provides a contribution of less than @xmath68 .",

    "one can see that the angular momentum contribution from the neutron @xmath69 core ; i.e. , from all the orbitals below @xmath69 , is quite small ( @xmath70 ) for config 1 and config 2 .",
    "however , the neutron angular momenta are almost all coming from the four valence neutrons in the @xmath36 and @xmath42 orbitals , which corresponds to a `` band termination '' .    for config 1 , a neutron sitting at the bottom of the @xmath36 shell contributes an angular momentum of roughly @xmath68 . when the rotational frequency increases from 0.3 mev to 1.2 mev , the contribution of this neutron does barely change , and the increment of the angular momentum comes mostly from the alignment of the other three neutrons in the @xmath42 shell , which is driven by the collectivity . in regards to the generation of the total angular momentum along the @xmath35 axis",
    ", the alignment of the neutron angular momentum contributes 3.35@xmath54 ( 55% ) , while the two - shears - like mechanism contributes 2.74@xmath54 ( 45% ) .    for config 2",

    "along the band , this @xmath36 orbital becomes purer and purer , and eventually provides roughly 3@xmath54 to the total angular momentum .",
    "therefore , such alignment originates from collective rotation as well , and together with the alignment of around 2.81@xmath54 , obtained from the two neutrons in the ( @xmath71 ) shell , collective rotation then accounts for almost 73% to the increment of the total angular momentum .",

    "[ figiw ] .",
    "it is found that the moments of inertia for both config 1 and config 2 are reproduced reasonably , especially their evolution with frequency .",
    "for config 1 , the rise of the @xmath27 ratios is characteristic of antimagnetic rotation , reflecting the fact that @xmath26 is essentially constant whereas the @xmath1 values rapidly approach zero as the spin increases along the band ( see fig .",

    "this is also consistent with the prediction of the classical model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath26 completely reflects how the interaction between the high-@xmath3 orbitals depends on their relative orientation .",
    "note that for a pure antimagnetic rotor , the angular momentum is carried by only a few nucleons in high-@xmath3 orbitals .    for config 2 ,",
    "however , the @xmath27 ratios exhibit decreasing tendency along the band , indicating that both @xmath26 and @xmath1 values drop with the reduction of deformation as the spin increases , and the former drop even faster than the latter .",

    "it should be kept in mind that collective rotation is a motion carried by many nucleons , each of which contributes a small fraction to the total angular momentum .",
