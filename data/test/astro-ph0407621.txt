    "there is increasing evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) exist at the center of all galaxies , and that they are the sources which power active galactic nuclei and quasars @xcite .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of the keplerian disk around an object in ngc4258 indicate that the central object has a mass @xmath7 .",
    "also , large numbers of observations are provided by the hubble space telescope suggesting that smbhs exist in galaxies such as m31 ( @xmath8 ) , m87 ( @xmath9 ) and our own galaxy ( @xmath10 ) ( see for example , * ? ? ? * for a brief overview ) . although evidence of the existence of smbhs is compelling , the actual formation process of these objects is still uncertain @xcite .",
    "several different scenarios have been proposed , some based on stellar dynamics , others on gas hydrodynamics , and still others which combine the processes . at present , there is no definitive observation as yet which confirms or rules out any one of these scenarios .    here",
    "we discuss the collapse of a supermassive star ( sms ) as one scenario of formation of an smbh .",
    "this subject is also interesting from a viewpoint of general relativity , since the onset of radial instability at the mass shedding limit takes place at @xmath11 ( @xmath1 is the angular momentum , @xmath2 is the total gravitational energy ) in the uniformly rotating sms @xcite , which is also considered as a critical threshold between formation of a stationary black hole ( bh ) and of a naked singularity .",
    "the bh uniqueness theorem says that a complete gravitational collapse of a body always results in a bh rather than a naked singularity , and that the final state of the bh should go into a stationary kerr bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however there is a candidate to except this cosmic censor .",
    "the collapse of a prolate spheroid with large semimajor axis leads to spindle singularities without an apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "therefore , a collapse of a star with the critical value @xmath12 may show us an interesting phenomenon in general relativity .",
    "what happens when the star of @xmath13 collapses ?",
    "what is the final fate of a collapsing star of @xmath13 ?",
    "numerical simulations can clearly show the answers to these questions .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a star of @xmath13 has been investigated most of all in axisymmetric spacetime .",
    "the pioneering study in this field was made by @xcite .",
    "he set up a differentially rotating star , adding radial velocity to induce the collapse .",
    "he found that the criterion of formation of a bh apparent horizon is @xmath14 .",
    "the following study has been done by @xcite .",
    "they set up a uniformly rotating @xmath15 polytropic star and deplete 99 % of the whole pressure to induce the collapse .",
    "they found that the criterion of bh formation is @xmath16 , and when the star exceeds the above value , flattened disk formed ( @xmath17 for the case of 99 % pressure deplete ) .",
    "note that @xmath18 represents the critical kerr parameter that the collapse proceeds to a bh .",
    "finally @xcite performed a collapse of a differentially rotating @xmath15 polytropic star .",
    "he also depleted the pressure of the star to induce the collapse .",
    "he found that when @xmath19 is less than 0.5 , a bh is formed when the rest mass is larger than the maximum mass of the pressure depleted @xmath1 constant sequence .",
    "when @xmath19 is slightly less than @xmath20 , a bh formed when the rest mass is sufficiently larger than the maximum allowed mass on the pressure depleted @xmath1 constant sequence .",
    "he also found , by comparing his results from polytropic evolution and from @xmath21-law evolution of the hydrodynamics , that shock heating prevents the prompt collapse to a bh under the condition of @xmath13 .    at the same time",
    "we have submitted our paper , several groups have also investigated the collapse of a relativistic star of @xmath13 in full general relativity .",
    "@xcite investigated the onset of radial instability of uniformly rotating stars in 2d and find that the criterion of @xmath19 is @xmath22 in a very soft polytropic equation of state ( @xmath23  @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is a polytropic index ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the collapse of a differentially rotating @xmath15 polytropic star in 3d by depleting the pressure and find that the criterion of bh formation is @xmath26 , and when the star exceeds the above value , the collapsing star forms a torus which fragments into nonaxisymmetric clumps .",
    "@xcite studied the collapsing star of @xmath13 in 2d with a polytropic index of @xmath15 and @xmath27 and find that the criterion for bh formation is determined by the central @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the specific angular momentum and @xmath31 is the cylindrical mass ) at the initial state of the star .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the following threefold .",
    "the first is to verify the nature of the gravitational collapse of a differentially rotating radially unstable star from the viewpoint of cosmic censor .",
    "if we collapse a star of @xmath32 , we expect that the star can not directly form a bh of @xmath32 because of cosmic censor .",
    "therefore it is important to find the main cause to prevent bh formation of @xmath33 . from the previous computational results , shock heating @xcite and core bounce @xcite are the dominant phenomena to prevent a star from forming a bh .",
    "however , all of the previous calculations have set up violent initial data sets , adding radial velocity or depleting pressure , to induce the collapse , it may cause abrupt transport of the energy .",
    "we therefore set up a mild , natural situation , that is a collapse of differentially rotating stars from the onset of radial instability , to focus on a graduate transport of the energy . also , we compute the collapsing star in 3d to allow shock propagation or bar formation , if it occurs .",
    "the second is to determine the final outcome of the collapse of differentially rotating smss .",
    "two different types of rotation profile arises during the quasi - static evolution of the rotating star , that depends on the environment .",
    "one is a uniformly rotating star , maintained uniform rotation during the quasi - static evolution by sufficiently strong viscosity or strong magnetic field .",
    "the other is a differentially rotating star , impossible to retain uniform rotation in low viscosity and low magnetic field (",
    "even the star initially takes uniform rotation ) . for the collapse of a uniformly rotating sms from the onset of radial instability",
    ", @xcite studied 3d relativistic hydrodynamic simulation in the post - newtonian gravitation and found that the collapse is coherent and that it is likely to form an smbh with no significant bar nor disk formation .",
    "followup computation has been performed in 2d hydrodynamics in full general relativity and found that approximately 10 % of the total mass can form a disk , while approximately 90 % of that should form a bh @xcite . for the differentially rotating stars ,",
    "the final outcome may strongly depends on the amount and the distribution of initial angular momentum , and the nature of angular momentum distribution of smss is largely unknown .",
    "we also do not know what path does a differentially rotating sms take during the quasi - static evolution .",
    "when the amount of angular momentum of the star is sufficient , the star seems to follow in a quasi - static evolution up to the mass - shedding limit .",
    "@xcite find in the newtonian quasi - static evolution that bar formation is inevitable before reaching mass - shedding limit .",
    "when the amount of angular momentum of the star is not sufficient , the star seems to collapse at the onset of radial instability before reaching secular instability ( @xmath34 for a uniformly rotating incompressible newtonian stars @xcite ) or mass - shedding limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the collapse of the sms from the onset of radial instability .",
    "when we consider the collapse of radially unstable differentially rotating stars , the final outcome has a possibility of differing from the collapse of uniform rotation because of the strong centrifugal force at the central core , which may prevent the prompt collapse .",
    "what is the final fate of the collapse ? does the star fragment due to the growth of the degree of differential rotation ? does the disk form during the collapse ?",
    "relativistic simulation can clearly answer to these questions .    finally , it is important to probe whether the collapse of differentially rotating smss could be a promising source of gravitational waves .",
    "direct detection of gravitational waves by ground based and space based interferometers is of great importance in general relativity , in astrophysics , and in cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the catastrophic collapse is one of the promising sources of gravitational waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a gravitational collapse of the star in a dynamical timescale , there are two main reasons that prevent a prompt collapse of the star , which should produce gravitational waves at that moment .",
    "one reason is core bounce and/or shock heating .",
    "suppose gravitational force is balanced to the centrifugal force ( @xmath35 ) in newtonian gravity .",
    "the total mass and the angular momentum ( @xmath36 ) are almost conserved during the collapse , assuming that gravitational radiation takes a little role during the collapse in the absence of nonaxisymmetric deformation prior to form a bh .",
    "note that @xmath37 is angular velocity , @xmath4 is the radius .",
    "we may estimate the bounce radius of the star in a global sense as @xmath38 .",
    "since the horizon radius is roughly the order of @xmath2 , core bounce might take place for the case @xmath32 , which prevents violation of cosmic censor @xcite .",
    "the other is bar formation . from the dimensional analysis",
    ", we can describe the rotational kinetic energy @xmath39 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath40 as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we also accept the assumption that total mass and angular momentum are almost conserved during the collapse .",
    "we could estimate the radius of bar formation in terms of the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational binding energy as @xmath43 . since the dynamical instability for a uniformly rotating , incompressible newtonian star sets in at @xmath44 @xcite and for relativistic gravitation as @xmath45 @xcite , bar formation takes place at the radius @xmath46 for the collapse of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we may expect that a gravitational collapse of @xmath13 is a promising source of quasi - periodic gravitational waves .",

    "note that we treat the matter fully relativistically ; the conformally flat approximation only enters through simplifications in the coupling to the gravitational fields . note also that we include an artificial viscosity , since core bounce might occur in our gravitational collapse and that should produce shocks .",
    "we will explain our form of an artificial viscosity in ",
    "[ sec : ctest ] . as a consequence to treat shocks we also need to solve the continuity equation @xmath91 separately .",
    "we solve the matter evolution in second order accurate in space and time with the transfer scheme of @xcite .",
    "there are three key issues to solve gravitational field equations numerically .",
    "the first is to introduce symmetric tensor @xmath92 related to the extrinsic curvature @xmath61 as @xcite @xmath93 therefore , we describe the equations of conformal factor ( eq .

    "the second is to decompose the vector type elliptic equation .",
    "the equation for the shift , @xmath98 can be further simplified by introducing a vector @xmath99 and a scalar @xmath100 according to @xcite @xmath101 the shift can then be computed from @xmath102 and will automatically satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shifteq ] ) .",

( [ eqn : wb ] ) and ( [ eqn : wchi ] ) are compact .",

    "first , we solve @xmath108 and @xmath109 since the source terms do not depend on other unknown spacetime variables .",

    "finally , we solve @xmath99 and @xmath109 .",
    "we use modified incomplete cholesky decomposition conjugate gradient ( miccg ) method @xcite to solve elliptic equations .",
    "finally , we should maintain our grid resolution at the central core of the collapsing star .",
    "the nested grid is one of the most appropriate way to handle this problem ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our method is a mimic version of the nested grid to handle the collapsing star problem , which is based on the rigridding method of @xcite . for the post",
    "homologous collapse of the sms , there are two different timescales in the collapsing star ; one is the collapsing timescale at the center and the other is the one at the envelope , which is sufficiently longer than that at the center .",
    "therefore , @xcite add the grid number at the intermediate stage of the collapse in order to control both regions , center and envelope of the star .",
    "since we perform the collapse of an sms in 3d , we concentrate on the central core of the collapse due to the limitation of computational resource . in order to maintain spatial grid resolution especially at the center ,",
    "we shrink the total grid to one half as the core radius of the star becomes half from the beginning of the present grid resolution .",
    "although this method changes the boundary condition when we `` zoom in '' the computational domain , it is approximately good when the difference of the gravitational mass between the end of the previous computational grid and the beginning is small .",
    "in fact , the difference of the gravitational mass between every two computational domains is less than @xmath114 , and therefore this `` zoom - in '' method should behave as a reasonable approximation for a collapse of differentially rotating smss .",

    "also , from the snapshots in the meridional plane , the material around the rotational axes collapses faster than the surrounding material due to the strong nonlinear gravitational field .",
    "let us now focus on the collapsing star ( model ii ) to probe the final outcome .",
    "we locally define the cylindrical rest mass @xmath31 , angular momentum @xmath30 , specific angular momentum @xmath213 , keplerian angular velocity @xmath214 as @xmath215 to indicate the transport of angular momentum and the distribution of @xmath216 .",
    "we assume the axisymmetric collapse to investigate the final outcome , since the meridional density snapshots ( fig . [",

    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows the concentration of mass density profile during the collapse . as the collapse goes on , the increase ratio of the cylindrical mass at the core of the star becomes high .",
    "in fact , @xmath217% of the cylindrical mass is inside the radius of @xmath218 at @xmath219 .",

    "we find that the mean radius monotonically decreases , which means that the collapse of the central core is coherent .",
    "figure [ fig : omega ] shows the variation of angular velocity profile during the collapse . since the cylindrical rest mass density shows a coherent collapse , the degree of differential rotation significantly increases at the core during the collapse and approaches to the `` keplerian '' angular velocity defined in eq .",

    "we show the specific angular momentum distribution during the collapse in fig .",
    "[ fig : jm ] . in a global sense",
    ", @xmath19 is conserved so that a final bh should violate cosmic censor , if it forms .",

    "although we should define the total gravitational mass locally to discuss the local distribution of @xmath19 , there is no knowing how to define it .",
    "therefore we use the local rest mass instead .",
    "we investigate the collapse of differentially rotating smss by means of hydrodynamic simulations in conformally flat approximation in general relativity .",
    "we start our collapse around the onset of radially instability at @xmath3 to the point where conformally flat approximation breaks down .",
    "we find that cosmic censor even holds for a gravitational collapse of a radially unstable differentially rotating equilibrium sms of @xmath32 .",
    "the main reason to prevent formation of a bh of @xmath32 is that quite a large amount of angular momentum stays at the surface , not core bounce nor shock propagation , bar formation in our model .",
    "note that even a thin disk near the surface of the star can hold relatively a large amount of angular momentum if the radius is large .",
    "the above conclusion is supported by @xcite in full general relativistic simulation that the criterion of bh formation is determined at the central @xmath28 ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "in fact , the central @xmath28 of model ii is @xmath224 , which satisfies their criterion .",
    "the collapse of a differentially rotating , radially unstable sms is coherent and likely leads to formation of an smbh .",
    "this situation is quite similar to the collapse of a uniformly rotating sms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since @xmath225 seems still not sufficient to change the path of the collapse from the one of uniform rotation .",
    "however , this final outcome may depend on the equation of state of the star .",
    "@xcite treated the isothermal ( @xmath226 ) collapse of initially homogeneous , uniformly rotating , low entropy clouds via smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "they found considerable fragmentation into dense clumps , and disk formation containing @xmath227 of the mass .",
    "they concluded that a seed bh will form at the center and that it likely will grow gradually by accretion in our model .",
    "also @xcite treated the collapse of uniformly rotating polytropic star from the critical onset in the range of @xmath228 and found that the mass of the disk is less than @xmath229 of the gravitational mass .",
    "we can not find any evidence of bar formation nor significant disk formation from the rotating collapse prior to bh formation .",
    "the phenomenon of no bar formation also comes from the fact that mass density collapses first to form a bh . in such case , @xmath194 can not scale in @xmath230 due to the growth of the degree of differential rotation , and as a fact the star of @xmath194 can not reach the dynamical instability point of @xmath231 . since the @xmath162 dynamical instability takes place when the star has a toroidal structure and soft equation of state @xcite , we can not find any evidence of toroidal structure at the time we stop our integration .",
