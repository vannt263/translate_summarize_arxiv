    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful in explaining the data taken from former colliders such as cern lep or fermilab tevatron .",
    "testing sm at the cern lhc will either lead to additional confirmation of the sm or give some hints for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "because of the large mass of the top quark , its couplings are expected to be more sensitive to new physics than other particles @xcite .",
    "especially , wtb vertex deserves special attention since the top quark is expected to decay almost completely via this interaction .",
    "thus , studying top quark couplings will be substantial to test the sm and a deviation of the top couplings from the expected values would imply the existence of new physics .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed anomalous wtb couplings via single top quark production in @xmath2 collision at the lhc .",
    "this reaction is probable at the lhc via elastic photon emission from one of the incoming protons .",
    "the emitted photon can collide with the other proton and produce a final state of @xmath3 through deep inelastic scattering ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we employ the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite for elastic photon emission from the proton . in the epa ,",
    "emitted photons have a low virtuality and it is a good approximation to assume that they are on - mass - shell .",
    "for this reason these photons are sometimes called quasi - real photons . when a proton emits a quasi - real photon it remains intact and scatters with a very small angle from the beam pipe .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc , have a program with very forward detectors .",
    "it is aimed to investigate soft and hard diffraction , low x dynamics with forward jet studies , high energy photon - induced interactions , large rapidity gaps between forward jets , and luminosity monitoring @xcite .",
    "these detectors will be located in a region nearly 220 - 420 m from the interaction point and they can detect protons in a continuous range of momentum fraction loss @xcite .",
    "momentum fraction loss of the proton is defined as @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the momentum of the incoming proton and @xmath6 is the momentum of the intact scattered proton .",
    "therefore equipped with very forward detectors , lhc can to some extend be considered as a high - energy photon - photon or photon - proton collider .",
    "photon induced rections have been experimentally observed through @xmath7 processes in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite , @xmath8 in ep collisions @xcite , and pair production in aa collisions @xcite .",
    "these experiments raise interest on the potential of lhc as a photon - photon and photon - proton collider and motivate phenomenological works on photon - induced reactions at the lhc as a probe of new physics @xcite .",
    "anomalous @xmath9 couplings can be investigated in a model independent way by means of the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "we employ the following effective lagrangian describing anomalous @xmath9 couplings : @xmath10+h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 it should be noted that lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) also give rise to anomalous @xmath12 couplings . in the sm",
    ", the ( v -a ) coupling @xmath13 corresponds to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath14 , which is very close to unity and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are equal to zero .    for off - shell top and/or bottom",
    "quarks the lagrangian in eq.([lagrangian ] ) is not the most general one , it should be extended with @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms where @xmath20 is the sum of the momenta of the t and b quarks .",
    "however , if wtb couplings arise from gauge invariant effective operators , single top production and decay can be described in full generality using the on - shell lagrangian in eq.([lagrangian ] ) for the wtb vertex , even in the process where the top and bottom quarks are far from their mass shell @xcite .",
    "if the w boson is off - shell , then there are additional terms containing @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these terms are omitted in the lagrangian , they can be recovered by applying the equation of motion through operators of the original lagrangian @xcite .",
    "measurements at d0 detector at fermilab tevatron provide stringent direct constraints on these couplings @xcite .",
    "the most stringent bounds on the anomalous couplings @xmath22 and @xmath16 are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 at 95% c.l .",
    "assuming that @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "recent results from early lhc data set comparable , but still weaker bounds with respect to tevatron @xcite .",
    "we see from the tevatron and lhc data that the bound on the coupling @xmath16 is weaker then the bound on @xmath17 and the bound on the coupling @xmath15 is weaker then the others @xcite .",
    "the ( v + a ) coupling @xmath15 is stringently bounded by the cleo @xmath26 data @xcite from an indirect analysis .",
    "limit from the cleo data is given by @xmath27 at @xmath28 level@xcite .",
    "it is explicit that indirect constraints are much more resrictive than direct constraints @xcite .    in the literature",
    "there has been a great amount of work on wtb couplings through single and pair top quark production .",
    "the single top quark production cross section was discussed below and above the @xmath29 threshold for the processes @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 at the cern lep @xcite .",
    "top quark single and pair production processes were studied for future linear @xmath32 collider and its @xmath33 and @xmath34 modes @xcite and also for @xmath2 collisions in tesla+herap and clic+lhc options @xcite .",
    "anomalous wtb couplings have also been probed at the lhc and tevatron @xcite .",
    "the equivalent photon spectrum of virtuality @xmath35 and energy @xmath36 is given by the following formula @xcite @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 in eq.(3 ) , e is the energy of the incoming proton beam and @xmath39 is mass of the proton .",
    "the magnetic moment of the proton is taken to be @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite . the photon spectrum",
    "which is integrated from a kinematic minimum @xmath42 up to @xmath43 is given by @xcite    @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the function @xmath45 is defined as follows @xmath46 + \\frac{(1-b)y}{4x(1+x)^{3}}+c\\left(1+\\frac{y}{4}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\\\times\\left[ln\\frac{1+x - b}{1+x}+\\sum^{3}_{k=1 } \\frac{b^{k}}{k(1+x)^{k}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47    @xmath48    in the epa emitted photons have a low virtuality and photon spectrum has a asymptotic behavior for large values of virtuality @xmath35 . in the epa that we have considered typical photon virtuality is @xmath49 @xcite . above this average virtuality value , spectrum function rapidly decreases and the contribution to the integral above @xmath50 is negligible . to be precise ,",
    "the difference between sm cross sections for @xmath51 and @xmath52 is at the order of @xmath53pb . therefore during calculations we set @xmath54 .",
    "we consider the subprocesses @xmath55 and @xmath56 of our main process @xmath57 . in the sm single production of the top quark via the process @xmath58 is described by three tree level diagrams .",
    "each of the diagrams contains a wtb vertex . in the effective lagrangian approach , there are four tree level diagrams ; one of them contains an anomalous @xmath59 vertex , which is absent in the sm ( fig.2 ) .    the total cross section for the process @xmath0 can be obtained by integrating the cross section for the subprocesses over the photon and quark distributions : @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the fraction which represents the ratio between @xmath63 @xmath64 quark and incoming proton s momentum .",
    "@xmath65 is the @xmath63 @xmath64 quark distribution function .",
    "we ignore interactions between different family quarks since the cross sections are suppressed due to small off diagonal elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix . in the total cross section calculations we have used martin , stirling , thorne and watt distribution functions @xcite .    in our calculations",
    "three different forward detector acceptance ranges have been discussed : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the former one was proposed by the atlas forward physics ( afp ) collaboration @xcite .",
    "the second acceptance range was proposed by the cms - totem forward detector scenario @xcite .",
    "since the forward detectors can detect protons in a continuous range of @xmath69 one can impose some cuts and choose to work in a subinterval of the whole acceptance region .",
    "hence , we also consider an acceptance of @xmath70 which is a subinterval of the cms - totem acceptance range .    in figs .",
    "3 - 6 we show the integrated total cross section of the process @xmath71 as a function of anomalous couplings @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath15 and @xmath74 for the acceptances of @xmath66 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . here , the anomalous coupling @xmath74 is defined by @xmath77 . in figs .",
    "3 and 4 we observe that cross section approximately has a same dependence to both @xmath78 and @xmath73 couplings .",
    "we see from fig . 5 that sensitivity of the cross section to anomalous coupling @xmath15 is comparably weak .",
    "we estimate the sensitivity of the process @xmath79 to anomalous couplings @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath15 and @xmath74 using a simple one parameter @xmath80 criterion for integrated luminosities of @xmath81 and @xmath82 = 14 tev .",
    "the @xmath80 function is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the statistical error .",
    "the expected number of events has been calculated considering the leptonic decay channel of the w boson and leptonic decay of the top quark as the signal @xmath85 , where @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "atlas and cms have central detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath88 .",
    "therefore we consider an acceptance window of @xmath88 for final state electrons , muons and b quark . branching ratios appearing in the number of events",
    "are defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the full width and @xmath91 is the decay rate for the corresponding channel with a cut of @xmath92 for final decay products .",
    "the limits for the anomalous coupling parameters are given in tables 1 - 4 for integrated luminosities of @xmath93 and forward detector acceptances of @xmath66 , @xmath94 and @xmath68 .",
    "we see from the tables that @xmath95 case provides more restrictive bounds on both @xmath96 and @xmath73 couplings compare to the @xmath66 and @xmath94 cases . on the other hand , limits on @xmath15 and @xmath74 couplings in @xmath97 case",
    "are weaker then the limits in @xmath66 and @xmath67 cases .",
    "the limits presented in tables are reasonable . in the effective lagrangian ( 1 )",
    "anomalous couplings @xmath15 and @xmath13 are originated from dimension 4 effective operators but anomalous couplings @xmath17 and @xmath16 are originated from dimension 5 effective operators .",
    "therefore energy dependence of the terms in the cross section proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath16 are expected to be higher than the standard model and also the terms in the cross section proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the main new physics contribution from couplings @xmath17 and @xmath16 comes from high energy region @xmath97 . on the contrary",
    ", the main standard model contribution comes from low energy region @xmath98 .",
    "the limits on @xmath17 and @xmath16 are expected to be better in the less forward region @xmath97 since the invariant mass of the incoming photon and b quark is large and the standard model background is low in that region .",
    "our limits on the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath16 are approximately a factor from 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 better then the limits from direct constraints at the tevatron respectively depending on the luminosity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our best limit on @xmath15 is a factor of 3.7 more restricted compared to tevatron direct constraint @xcite .",
    "physics studied at the lhc is significantly enhanced via the forward physics programs of atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "equipped with forward detectors lhc gives us new options to examine high energy photon - proton interactions .",
    "with respect to pure deep inelastic scattering processes , photon - proton interactions provide a quite clean channel due to absence of one of the incoming proton remnants .",
    "furthermore , detection of the intact scattered protons in the forward detectors allows us to reconstruct quasi - real photons momenta .",
    "this provides an advantage in reconstruction of the kinematics .",
