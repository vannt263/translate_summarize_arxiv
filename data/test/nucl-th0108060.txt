    ", one can not navely extract fundamental iso - scalar and iso - vector properties of the nucleon separately from experiment . on the other hand , of all nuclei ,",
    "the deuteron comes closest to an iso - scalar target and hence appears well suited to extract nucleon and  after removing proton effects  neutron properties . still , the analysis is not straightforward because , however small the deuteron binding energy seems , binding effects are often not negligible at low energies where properties of the static nucleon are tested .",
    "although the impulse approximation of treating the nucleons inside the deuteron as quasi - free is bound to become the better the higher the typical momentum scale of the process is , the improved resolution also necessitates a more detailed description of both the binding between and structure of the nucleons : effects from meson exchanges and excited states are resolved at intermediate scales , and at even higher energies , the nucleons and mesons themselves dissolve into quarks and gluons .",
    "nonetheless , model - independent predictions and extractions at low energies can succeed because nuclear physics provides a separation of scales .",
    "this observation is a cornerstone of the effective field theory approach .",
    "effective field theory methods are largely used in many branches of physics where a separation of scales exists . in low energy nuclear systems ,",
    "the scales are , on one side , the low scales of the typical momentum of the process considered and the pion mass , and on the other side the higher scales associated with chiral symmetry and confinement .",
    "this separation of scales produces a low energy expansion , resulting in a description of strongly interacting particles which is systematic and rigorous .",
    "it is also model independent ( meaning , independent of assumptions about the non - perturbative qcd dynamics ) : given that qcd is the theory of strong interactions and that chiral symmetry is broken via the goldstone mechanism , wilson s renormalisation group arguments show that there is only one local low energy field theory which originates from it : chiral perturbation theory and its extension to the many - nucleon system discussed here .",
    "three main ingredients enter the construction of an eft : the lagrangean , the power counting and a regularisation scheme .",
    "first , the relevant degrees of freedom are identified . in his original suggestion how to extend eft methods to systems containing two or more nucleons , weinberg  @xcite noticed that below the @xmath1 production scale , only nucleons and pions need to be retained as the infrared relevant degrees of freedom of low energy qcd . because at these scales the momenta of the nucleons are small compared to their rest mass , the theory becomes non - relativistic at leading order in the velocity expansion , with relativistic corrections systematically included at higher orders .",
    "the most general chirally invariant lagrangean consists hence of contact interactions between non - relativistic nucleons , and between nucleons and pions , with the first terms reading @xmath2\\;+",

    "the iso - vector - scalar part of the @xmath6 lagrangean introduces more constants @xmath7 and interactions and has not been displayed for convenience .",
    "the field @xmath8 describes the pion with a decay constant @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the chirally covariant derivative , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the axial ( vector ) pionic current .",
    "the interactions involving pions are severely restricted by chiral invariance .",
    "as such , the theory is an extension of chiral perturbation theory and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to the many nucleon system : the terms in the first line couple only pions amongst themselves , and to one nucleon , providing the familiar nuclear long range force .",
    "the terms of the second line couple two nucleons to each other and to pions via point - like interactions . like in its cousins , the coefficients of the low energy lagrangean",
    "encode all short distance physics ",
    "branes and strings , quarks and gluons , resonances like the @xmath1 or @xmath13  as strengths of the point - like interactions between particles . as it is not possible yet to derive these constants by solving qcd e.g.  on the lattice , the most practical way to determine them is by fitting to experiment .",
    "because the lagrangean ( [ ksw ] ) consists of infinitely many terms only restricted by symmetry , an eft may at first sight suffer from lack of predictive power .",
    "indeed , as the second part of an eft formulation , predictive power is ensured by establishing a power counting scheme , i.e.  a way to determine at which order in a momentum expansion different contributions will appear , and keeping only and all the terms up to a given order .",
    "the dimensionless , small parameter on which the expansion is based is the typical momentum @xmath14 of the process in units of the scale @xmath15 at which the theory is expected to break down .",
    "values for @xmath15 and @xmath14 have to be determined from comparison to experiments and are a priori unknown .",
    "assuming that all contributions are of natural size , i.e.  ordered by powers of @xmath14 , the systematic power counting ensures that the sum of all terms left out when calculating to a certain order in @xmath14 is smaller than the last order retained , allowing for an error estimate of the final result .",
    "for extremely small momenta @xmath16 , the pion does not enter as explicit degree of freedom describing long range forces .",
    "all its effects are absorbed into the coefficients @xmath17 , while formally @xmath18 in ( [ ksw ] ) .",
    "the only forces between nucleons are thus point - like two and more nucleon interactions with strengths @xmath17 .",
    "this effective nuclear theory with pions integrated out ( ent(@xmath19 ) ,  @xcite ) was recently pushed to very high orders in the two - nucleon sector where accuracies of the order of @xmath20 were obtained .",
    "it can be viewed as a systematisation of effective range theory with the inclusion of relativistic and short distance effects traditionally left out in that approach . because of non - analytic contributions from the pion cut , the breakdown scale of this theory must be of the order @xmath21 . for the ent with explicit pions , we would suspect the breakdown scale to be of the order of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , as @xmath1 and @xmath13 are not explicit degrees of freedom in ( [ ksw ] ) .",
    "even if calculations of nuclear properties were possible starting from the underlying qcd lagrangean , eft simplifies the problem considerably by factorising it into a long distance part which contains the infrared - relevant physics and is dealt with by eft methods and a short distance part , subsumed into the coefficients of the lagrangean .",
    "qcd therefore `` only '' has to provide these constants , avoiding full - scale calculations of e.g.  bound state properties of two nuclear systems using quarks and gluons .",
    "eft provides an answer of finite accuracy because higher order corrections are systematically calculable and suppressed in powers of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the power counting allows for an error estimate of the final result , with the natural size of all neglected terms known to be of higher order .",
    "relativistic effects , chiral dynamics and external currents are included systematically , and extensions to include e.g.  parity violating effects are straightforward . gauged interactions and exchange currents are unambiguous .",
    "results obtained with eft are easily dissected for the relative importance of the various terms . because only @xmath24-matrix elements between on - shell states are observables , ambiguities nesting in `` off - shell effects ''",
    "are absent .",
    "on the other hand , because only symmetry considerations enter the construction of the lagrangean , efts are less restrictive as no assumption about the underlying qcd dynamics is incorporated .",
    "hence the proverbial quib that `` eft parameterises our ignorance '' .    in systems involving two or more nucleons , establishing a power counting",
    "is complicated because unnaturally large scales have to be accommodated : given that the typical low energy scale in the problem should be the mass of the pion as the lightest particle emerging from qcd , fine tuning is required to produce the large scattering lengths in the @xmath25 wave channels ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "since there is a bound state in the @xmath27 channel with a binding energy @xmath28 and hence a typical binding momentum @xmath29 well below the scale @xmath15 at which the theory should break down , it is also clear that at least some processes have to be treated non - perturbatively in order to accommodate the deuteron , i.e.  an infinite number of diagrams has to be summed or equivalently , a schrdinger equation needs to be solved .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us first turn to ent(@xmath19)in which the pion is integrated out . here , a way to incorporate this fine tuning into the power counting",
    "was suggested by kaplan , savage and wise  @xcite , and by van kolck  @xcite . at very low momenta ,",
    "contact interactions with several derivatives ",
    "like @xmath30  should become unimportant , and we are left only with the contact interactions proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the dominating contribution to nucleons scattering in an @xmath25 wave comes hence from two nucleon contact interactions and is summed geometrically in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] in order to produce the shallow real bound state .",
    "how to justify this ?",
    "dimensional analysis allows the size of any diagram to be estimated by scaling momenta by a factor of @xmath14 and non - relativistic kinetic energies by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining integral includes no dimensions and is taken to be of the order @xmath33 and of natural size .",
    "this scaling implies the rule that nucleon propagators contribute one power of @xmath34 and each loop a power of @xmath35 . assuming that @xmath36 the diagrams contributing at leading order to the deuteron propagator are indeed an infinite number as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] , each one of order @xmath37 .",
    "the deuteron propagator @xmath38 has the correct pole position and cut structure when one chooses @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath31 becomes dependent on an arbitrary scale @xmath40 because of the regulator dependent , linear uv divergence in each of the bubble diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] . indeed , when choosing @xmath41 , the leading order contact interaction scales as in ( [ scalingksw ] ) .",
    "as expected for a physical observable , the @xmath6 scattering amplitude becomes independent of @xmath40 , the renormalisation scale or cut - off chosen .",
    "all other coefficients @xmath17 can be shown to be higher order , so that the scheme is self - consistent .",
    "observables are independent of the cut - off chosen .",
    "the linear divergence of each bubble in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] does not show in dimensional regularisation as a pole in @xmath42 dimensions , but it does appear as a pole in @xmath43 dimensions which we subtract following the power divergence subtraction scheme  @xcite .",
    "dimensional regularisation is chosen to explicitly preserve the systematic power counting as well as all symmetries ( esp .",
    "chiral invariance ) at each order in every step of the calculation . at leading ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and often even n@xmath44lo in the two nucleon system",
    ", it also allows for simple , closed answers whose analytic structure is readily asserted .",
    "power divergence subtraction moves hence a somewhat arbitrary amount of the short distance contributions from loops to counterterms and makes precise cancellations manifest which arise from fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "the power counting of the zero and one nucleon sector of the theory are fixed by chiral perturbation theory and its extension to the one baryon sector .",
    "therefore , the question to be posed is : how does the power counting of the contact terms @xmath17 change above the pion cut , i.e.  when the pion must be included as explicit degree of freedom ?",
    "if pulling out pion effects does not affect the running of @xmath45 too much , one surprising result arises : because chiral symmetry implies a derivative coupling of the pion to the nucleon at leading order , the instantaneous one pion exchange scales as @xmath33 and is _ smaller _ than the contact piece @xmath46 .",
    "pion exchange and higher derivative contact terms appear hence only as perturbations at higher orders .",
    "the lo contribution in this scheme is still given by the geometric series in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] .",
    "in contradistinction to iterative potential model approaches , each higher order contribution is inserted only once . in this scheme ,",
    "the only non - perturbative physics responsible for nuclear binding is extremely simple , and the more complicated pion contributions are at each order given by a finite number of diagrams .",
    "for example , the nlo contributions to @xmath6 scattering in the @xmath47 channel are the one instantaneous pion exchange and the two nucleon interaction with two derivatives , fig .  [",
    "fig : nloksw ] .",
    "the constants are determined e.g.  by demanding the correct scattering length and effective range .",
    "this approach is known as the `` ksw '' counting of ent , ent(ksw )  @xcite .        if on the other hand , the power counting for @xmath31",
    "is dramatically modified when one includes pions , both the @xmath45 interactions and the one pion exchange might have to be iterated . in his paper , weinberg  @xcite therefore suggested to power count not the amplitude  as is usually done in eft  but the potential , and then to solve a schrdinger equation with a chiral potential , as pictorially represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg ] .",
    "e.  epelbaum s talk  @xcite gives more details on the results obtained so far in this approach .",
    "both power countings are presently under investigation for consistency and convergence , and each has its advantages and shortcomings  @xcite .",
    "recently , beane et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that weinberg s power counting is not self - consistent in the spin doublet channel of @xmath6 scattering and that pions are perturbative there , although convergence is slow . on the other hand ,",
    "the strongly attractive @xmath48 part of the pionic tensor force in the spin triplet channel necessitates a non - perturbative renormalisation of the one pion exchange . in that channel ,",
    "the ksw counting is hence inconsistent , and weinberg s proposal is chosen by nature .",
    "it is not yet clear how this observation is to be extended to the power counting of counter terms in which two or more nucleons couple on external currents .",
    "after all , nuclear physics in the two body system is more than @xmath6 scattering .",
    "although in general process dependent , the expansion parameter is found to be of the order of @xmath49 in both approaches and in most applications , so that nlo calculations can be expected to be accurate to about @xmath50 , and n@xmath51localculations to about @xmath52 . in all cases",
    ", experimental agreement is within the estimated theoretical uncertainties , and in some cases , previously unknown counterterms could be determined .",
    "the first example we turn to demonstrates not only how simple it is to compute processes involving both external gauge and exchange currents in a self - consistent way , but also how `` effective '' the power counting is to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the following calculation is model - independent and performed in ent(@xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "the iso - scalar , scalar electric and magnetic dipole nucleon polarisabilities parameterise the deformation of the nucleon in an external electro - magnetic dipole field : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . how accurate does one have to measure elastic compton scattering of photons on the deuteron to see them , and how severe are the binding effects which distinguish the deuteron from an iso - scalar target ?",
