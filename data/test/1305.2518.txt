    "they are often compared with the theoretical predictions , which are obtained at a given values of @xmath8 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "the extraction of nuclear temperature @xmath8 and angular momentum @xmath11 is crucial for a meaningful comparison between experiment and theory because the initial temperature @xmath15 and/or angular momentum @xmath16 at the first step in the decay of the compound nucleus are significantly higher than the mean values @xmath17 and @xmath18 , obtained by averaging over all daughter nuclei in the decay process .",
    "moreover , while the theoretical gdr strength function is calculated at a fixed value of @xmath8 and/or @xmath11 , its experimental counterpart is extracted by fitting the spectrum , which is generated by a multistep cascade decay , where the nucleus undergoes a cooling down from the initial maximal value of @xmath15 ( and/or @xmath16 ) . because of this mechanism , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have proposed to incorporate the theoretical strength functions into the full statistical decay calculations and compare the results obtained with the experimental data .",
    "this method was applied to test the validity of several theoretical models in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely the collisional damping model ( cdm )  @xcite , the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm )  @xcite , and the phonon damping model ( pdm )  @xcite .",
    "the cdm studies the gdr evolution within the framework of the macroscopic landau - vlasov theory that includes the collision term in the landau integral .",
    "the tsfm describes the gdr line shape by calculating the gdr cross section as a thermal average over all shape - dependent cross sections under quadrupole deformations .",
    "the pdm describes the broadening of the gdr width at low and medium @xmath8 and @xmath11 as well as its saturation at high @xmath8 and @xmath11 via coupling of the gdr to noncollective particle - hole ( ph ) , particle - particle ( pp ) and hole - hole ( hh ) configurations .",

    "the pdm is also capable of correctly describing the temperature dependence of the gdr width at low temperature ( @xmath21 2 mev )  @xcite .",
    "however , a question still remains open , namely it is not clear if the gdr line shape obtained by averaging the gdr strength functions in the whole interval of @xmath8 and/or @xmath11 , within which the daughter nuclei are populated , is equivalent to the gdr strength function obtained at the mean values @xmath17 of temperature and @xmath18 of angular momentum in these intervals . resolving this issue",
    "has a practical importance since if the answer is positive , one can avoid the calculations of many strength functions as the temperature and/or angular momentum decreases starting from @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 to obtain the average line shape , and use the strength function obtained at one given pair of values @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead .",

    "<S> the line shapes of giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in the decay of the compound nucleus @xmath0mo , which is formed after the fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath1ti @xmath2 @xmath3ca at various excitation energies @xmath4 from 58 to 308 mev , are generated by averaging the gdr strength functions predicted within the phonon damping model ( pdm ) using the empirical probabilities for temperature and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the average strength functions are compared with the pdm strength functions calculated at the mean temperature and mean angular momentum , which are obtained by averaging the values of temperature and angular momentum using the same temperature and angular - momentum probability distributions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that these two ways of generating the gdr linear line shape yield very similar results . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the gdr width approaches a saturation at angular momentum @xmath5 50@xmath6 at @xmath7 4 mev and at @xmath5 70@xmath6 at any @xmath8 . </S>"
