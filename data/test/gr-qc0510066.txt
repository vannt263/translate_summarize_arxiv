    "the dynamical response of black holes to any external disturbance is dominated , at intermediate times , by a discrete set of damped oscillations called quasinormal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "this result has been verified not only at linearized level , but also in fully numerical simulations for stellar gravitational collapse @xcite and collision of two black holes @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observation in the forthcoming years of the radiation due to the qnms opens a new perspective for the gravitational wave astronomy . from these observations it will be possible to obtain direct evidence of black holes existence , as well as to estimate their parameters ( mass , electric charge , and angular momentum ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the astrophysical applications , an interpretation appeared some years ago of the qnms in terms of the ads / cft conjecture @xcite . according to this conjecture",
    ", there is a correspondence relation ( or duality ) between string theory in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of this space @xcite .",
    "it implies that a large black hole in the ads spacetime corresponds to an approximately thermal state in the cft .",
    "perturbing the black hole is equivalent to perturbing the thermal state , and the perturbation damping time gives the time scale for the return to the thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , by computing quasinormal ( qn ) frequencies in an ads space it is possible to obtain the thermalization time scale in the strongly coupled cft .",
    "the early works studying perturbations of ads black holes considered the evolution of a conformally invariant scalar field in such background spacetimes @xcite .",
    "after the advent of the ads / cft conjecture , qnms of spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant , such as kottler ( also called schwarzschild - ads ) @xcite , reissner - nordstrm - ads @xcite and kerr - ads @xcite , were computed for different fields , dimensions , and boundary conditions . within this program , other kinds of black hole solutions were also analyzed .",
    "for instance , in the baados - teitelboim - zanelli solution @xcite , analytical expressions for the qn frequencies presented exact agreement with the poles of the retarded correlation function in the dual cft @xcite .",
    "this result provided an important quantitative test of the ads / cft correspondence . as a complement to the aforementioned studies , analyses of the time evolution of some fields in asymptotically ads backgrounds",
    "have been performed @xcite .",
    "more recently , the conjecture relating the highly damped qnms to black hole area quantization has motivated a search for qn frequencies with large imaginary parts also in asymptotically ads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the studies of perturbations in ads spacetimes were also extended to black holes with nonspherical topology . in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution of a conformal scalar field in the family of topological backgrounds was investigated , which includes the plane - symmetric black hole as one of its members , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the case of a nonminimally coupled scalar field in the same kind of spacetimes was considered . lately , the lowest qn frequencies associated with the scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations of the plane - symmetric black hole background were computed @xcite .",
    "the study of the scalar and electromagnetic fields was relatively complete .",
    "however , important questions were left without answers in connection with the gravitational perturbations .",
    "for instance , what are the wave equations governing general metric perturbations ? what is the physical interpretation of the modes with different wave numbers ?",
    "what are the qn frequencies in the intermediate and small black hole regimes ? what is the relation between these frequencies and the wave number ?",
    "why is the pure imaginary frequency not proportional to the horizon radius in the large black hole limit as it happens for ordinary modes ?",
    "is there some relation between the latter and the algebraically special frequency ? and what is the behavior of the qnm spectrum in the regime of highly damped overtones ?",
    "the objective of the present work is answering most of the previous questions as well as other ones that appeared during this work .",
    "some of the conclusions drawn here are extended to the schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ solucao ] , we write the equations defining the background spacetime in a newman - penrose ( np ) null tetrad frame @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ perturb - np ] , we obtain schrdingerlike equations governing the axial and polar perturbations . in sec .",
    "[ qnm ] , we define the qnm boundary conditions to be used and prove the black holes stability against perturbations with a non - negative potential .",
    "a brief description of the horowitz - hubeny method ( sec . [ metodo ] ) follows , as well as subsequent exposition of the qn frequency values for different horizon radii and wave numbers ( sec .",
    "[ resultados ] ) .",
    "then , we study the large black hole limit of the axial qnms ( sec .",
    "[ limite ] ) and the non - qn character of the algebraically special frequency ( sec .",
    "[ algebrico ] ) . finally , we conclude by summarizing and commenting the main results ( sec .",
    "[ conclusao ] ) .    throughout this work , we use the geometric system of units in which the speed of light and the newton s gravitational constant are set to unity .",
    "the background spacetime , moreover , has a natural lengthscale given by the ads radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the negative cosmological constant .",
    "here we choose the length unit so that @xmath7 and measure everything in terms of the ads radius . in relation to notation , the asterisk ( @xmath8 ) denotes complex conjugation and the definition of the np quantities follows ref .",
    "with the aim of investigating the evolution of linear gravitational perturbations in the background of a plane - symmetric ads black hole @xcite , we summarize here the basic properties of such a spacetime .",
    "the metric may be written in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 there is an event horizon at @xmath11 , and an essential singularity at @xmath12 .",
    "depending on the ranges of coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the metric may represent a cylindrical ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , toroidal ( @xmath17 ) or planar ( @xmath18 ) black hole spacetime .",
    "for the torus , @xmath19 is related to the adm system mass @xcite ; for the cylinder , to the mass per length unit of @xmath14 line @xcite ; and for the plane , to the mass per area unit of the @xmath20 plane @xcite .    according to the petrov classification , the above metric is algebraically type d. it is then convenient to define the np quantities in terms of a kinnersley - like null frame @xcite . in this case",
    ", the two real vectors of such a frame , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are chosen to lie , respectively , on the ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesics and are defined by @xmath23 which are the double principal null directions of the weyl tensor . in order to complete the frame basis we have the vector @xmath24 and its complex conjugate @xmath25 .",
    "both of these vectors , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are orthogonal to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath30 . with the chosen tetrad basis ,",
    "the only nonvanishing spin coefficients are @xmath31 and the only nonvanishing weyl and ricci scalars are @xmath32",
    "here the equations for the linear gravitational perturbations are obtained by using the np formalism , which allows us to investigate general properties of such perturbations without any further simplifying assumption . in this approach , changes in the metric coefficients are directly related to changes in the tetrad null vectors .",
    "furthermore , perturbations in the vectors @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath33 lead to first order alterations in weyl and ricci scalars , and also in the spin coefficients .",
    "the full system of linearized perturbation equations is obtained by expanding the complete np equations on the plane - symmetric black hole background , and retaining only the first order terms in the perturbation functions .",
    "generally , the linearized np equations form a large system of coupled equations whose solutions are difficult to be found . however , for petrov type d vacuum spacetimes , the problem reduces to solving a pair of decoupled equations for the gauge and tetrad invariants @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "these equations assume the simple forms @xmath36\\psi_{0}=0 , \\label{fund1}\\\\ [ ( \\delta+3\\gamma-\\gamma^{\\ast}+4\\mu+\\mu^{\\ast})(d-\\rho)- \\delta^{\\ast}\\delta-3\\psi_{2}]\\psi_{4}=0 . \\label{fund2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the foregoing equations are already linearized since the weyl scalars @xmath34 and @xmath35 vanish in the equilibrium state , and then they are to be considered first order perturbations .",
    "the other quantities take their unperturbed values given in eqs . - .",
    "the background symmetries , together with the perturbation equations and , indicate that each one of the perturbation functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written as a product of four different functions depending upon only one of the coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , due to the wavelike character of the equations , the dependence of these functions on the coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is of the form @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the frequency , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are wave numbers which may assume discrete or continuous values , depending on whether @xmath13 and @xmath14 are compact or noncompact coordinates , respectively .",
    "the radial functions , in turn , are conveniently written as @xmath43 where the subscripts @xmath44 are related to the spin weight and to the conformal weight of the weyl scalars @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting equations for @xmath45 take the following standard form : @xmath46 where we introduced the differential operators @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the tortoise coordinate , defined in such a way that @xmath49 , and @xmath50 with @xmath51 .    the chandrasekhar transformation theory @xcite can now be used to transform eqs . into one - dimensional schrdingerlike equations of the form @xmath52 this is done by means of the substitutions @xmath53 whose inverse transformation gets the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 in the foregoing equations , the potential functions @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 , \\label{pot - polar}\\ ] ] @xmath58 while the auxiliary functions @xmath59 are , respectively , @xmath60    the meaning of the signs @xmath61 comes from the metric approach to the perturbation problem , as it was performed in ref .",
    "they are related to the parity property of the perturbed metric functions under the exchange @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath64 represents the polar ( even ) perturbations , while @xmath65 represents the axial ( odd ) ones .    in a certain sense",
    ", the wave equations can be thought of as a generalization to those found by cardoso and lemos @xcite . here",
    "the perturbations depend on both coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while in the aforementioned work the analysis was restricted to @xmath14-independent metric variations .",
    "this is equivalent to the vanishing of the wave number @xmath42 , resulting in @xmath66 .",
    "however , the plane symmetry of the background spacetime renders possible to find new coordinates ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) in such a way that one of the wave numbers , @xmath69 or @xmath70 , is zero .",
    "that is to say , it is always possible to find a coordinate system in which the perturbations depend only on two space coordinates ( @xmath38 and @xmath13 , or @xmath38 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "another result derived from the above analysis is related to the starobinsky constant @xcite , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are given by eq . .",
    "the solutions of @xmath73 correspond to algebraically special frequencies in the sense of chandrasekhar @xcite . as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ resultados ] , one of such solutions , given by @xmath74 appears in the numerical results in connection to the purely damped qnms .",
    "the properties of the axial perturbations related to these algebraically special modes are analyzed in some detail in sec .",
    "[ algebrico ] .",
    "to solve the wave equations we must impose boundary conditions on the possible solutions .",
    "first , however , consider the case of the asymptotically flat schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "gravitational perturbations lead to schrdingerlike equations whose potentials vanish at infinity and at the event horizon .",
    "hence , close to these extremities , the solutions are plane waves , @xmath75 , where the @xmath48 coordinate ranges from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "qnms are then defined as solutions which are purely ingoing waves at the horizon , @xmath78 , and purely outgoing waves at infinity , @xmath79 .",
    "these requirements are satisfied only for a discrete set of complex @xmath40 called the quasinormal frequencies .    in asymptotically ads spacetimes",
    ", we keep the requirement of purely ingoing waves at the horizon . in the meantime , since now the tortoise coordinate @xmath48 takes a finite value at spatial infinity , the boundary condition at infinity must be changed .",
    "this can be dirichlet , neumann , or robin boundary condition , depending on whether the field , its derivative , or a combination of both vanishes , respectively . here , as in most of the literature , we adopt dirichlet boundary conditions , since these lead to energy conservation in the field theory on ads space @xcite ( for alternative boundary conditions see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "having defined the qnms , we show below that the imaginary part of the qn frequencies is positive for non - negative potentials .",
    "the demonstration follows the one carried out in the schwarzschild - ads case by cardoso and lemos @xcite .",
    "initially , we exchange the variable @xmath80 by @xmath81 , so that eq . becomes @xmath82 where @xmath80 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 stand for both perturbation types , the polar @xmath85 and the axial ones @xmath86 .",
    "near the horizon and at infinity , the solutions @xmath83 satisfying the qnm boundary conditions are given , respectively , by @xmath87 } , \\label{assint1}\\ ] ] @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are definite constants whose values depend on the perturbation type .",
    "now we multiply eq . by @xmath93 and integrate by parts using the asymptotic solutions and . after some algebra",
    "we obtain @xmath94dr= \\frac{|\\omega|^{2}|\\phi(r_{+})|^{2}}{\\mbox{im}(\\omega)}. \\label{int - final}\\ ] ] since @xmath95 assumes only positive values outside of the black hole , the sign of the quantity on the left hand side of eq .",
    "depends crucially on the sign of the potential @xmath96 . for non - negative @xmath84",
    ", it follows that the imaginary part of the qn frequencies is positive , @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , it is seen from eq . that @xmath98 is positive in the region @xmath99 for any @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and",
    "then we conclude that the plane - symmetric ads black holes are stable against polar perturbations .",
    "the same is true for axial perturbations as far as the wave numbers are restricted by @xmath100 . on the other hand , for @xmath101 ,",
    "the potential @xmath102 takes negative values and the theorem can not be applied .",
    "another interesting property of frequencies associated to perturbations of a plane - symmetric black hole comes from the particular symmetry of such a background .",
    "this symmetry allows us to rescale @xmath40 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 by a pure scale transformation of coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a constant @xcite .",
    "it implies that the frequency is a first degree homogeneous function of its parameters : @xmath108 .",
    "in particular , we can take @xmath109 so that @xmath110 then , after computing the qn frequencies for a given @xmath1 , e. g. , for @xmath111 , and for different values of @xmath0 , we can obtain @xmath112 by using the previous equation , and the values of @xmath40 for a fixed wave number @xmath1 are naturally divided into three different regimes : large ( @xmath113 ) , intermediate ( @xmath114 ) and small ( @xmath115 ) black holes . in the large ( small ) black hole limit , @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) is negligibly small and it is expected that @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we are now in a position to solve the perturbation equations and to find the values of the qn frequencies .",
    "this task , however , is more easily done through numerical procedures .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate summarizing here the method used for such a purpose .",
    "in the last decades a series of methods has been developed to numerically calculate the qnms of black holes . here",
    "we briefly describe one of these methods , used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is of particular interest for the present work since it is suited for asymptotically ads spacetimes . in order to apply such a method we rewrite here the perturbation equations in the appropriate form .    by introducing the independent variable @xmath118 , eq . becomes @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with @xmath84 and @xmath122 now being considered as functions of @xmath123 . the foregoing equation has a regular singular point ( @xmath124 ) in the region of interest , @xmath125 .",
    "then , by fuchs theorem , any solution of can be written as a frbenius series @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the solutions near the horizon may be explored by writing @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a constant to be determined . by substituting this expression into eq . and keeping terms only to the leading order , it follows that @xmath128 , which has the roots @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "these roots correspond exactly to the ingoing and outgoing waves at the horizon , respectively @xcite . since we want only ingoing modes , we take @xmath129 and look for solutions of the form @xmath131 substituting eq . into ,",
    "we find expressions for the @xmath132 s in terms of the frequency @xmath40 ( and of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "then , imposing the boundary condition at infinity , @xmath134 , we obtain @xmath135 thus , the problem of finding qn frequencies has been reduced to that of obtaining the roots of the infinite - order polynomial equation .",
    "of course , we can not carry out numerically the full sum in expression .",
    "in effect we truncate the series after a large number of terms and look for the zeros of this partial sum .",
    "the precision of the results is then verified by computing the relative variation between the zeros as we perform higher partial sums .",
    "we stop our search once we have a @xmath136 decimal digit precision . for each pair of @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ", we find a set of qn frequencies ( out of the infinity of possible frequencies ) .",
    "these frequencies are labeled as usual with the principal quantum number @xmath137 and ordered in a set beginning with the roots with the lowest imaginary parts .",
    "we use the horowitz - hubeny procedure described above to compute the gravitational qnms of plane - symmetric ads black holes . as it happens to other ads black holes , there are _ purely damped modes _ ,",
    "whose frequencies are pure imaginary numbers , in addition to the _ ordinary modes _ , the frequencies of which also have nonzero real parts which are responsible for the oscillatory behavior of the perturbations .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the numerical analysis is divided into three different regimes according to the ratio @xmath138 values . that is to say , we have ( i ) large black holes when the ratio @xmath138 is large compared to unity ; ( ii ) intermediate black holes if @xmath138 is of the order of unity ; and ( iii ) small black holes when @xmath138 is small compared to unity .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that some numerical analysis of the gravitational qnms was done in ref .",
    "however , such a study was restricted mainly to the large black hole regime for a specific value of @xmath1 , without generalizations for a generic wave number . in",
    "what follows , we perform a more detailed analysis , including small and intermediate black holes , and extend implicitly the numerical results to all values of @xmath1 .",
    "we also search the qn frequency values in the limit of highly damped overtones .      to begin with",
    ", we discuss the case of regular ( ordinary ) qnms for which the frequencies have nonvanishing real and imaginary parts , @xmath139 .",
    "we list some numerical results of the lowest quasinormal frequencies for @xmath140 and some selected values of @xmath0 .",
    "the computed quantities include both the axial and polar perturbations , and the three regimes defined above .",
    "the data for large , intermediate , and small black holes are shown , respectively , in tables [ tlarge ] , [ tmedium ] , and [ tsmall ] .",
    ".the lowest ordinary qn frequencies for @xmath140 and several values of @xmath0 in the large black hole regime . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "although numerical procedures need to be used to compute the qn frequencies , it is possible to study analytically the special case of axial perturbations of very large black holes .",
    "here we show in some detail the process of finding an asymptotic expression for the frequency of the purely damped modes .",
    "the analysis is performed in such a way that it holds for both the plane - symmetric and the schwarzschild - ads spacetimes .",
    "our starting point is the horowitz - hubeny approach described in sec .",
    "[ metodo ] . there",
    ", the qn frequencies of axial perturbations are associated to solutions of the equation @xmath141 hence , we need to obtain an analytical expression for the sum of this series in order to find exact frequency values . such a task is very difficult to be carried out for a general @xmath133 , but it becomes feasible for the large black hole limit of purely damped modes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath142 appearing in eq .",
    "are the frbenius coefficients of the power series solution to either eq . written for the axial functions , or the corresponding equation in the schwarzschild - ads case ( see ref .",
    "they are given in terms of the frequency , and of the other physical parameters of the problem , by the following recurrence formulas : @xmath143 .",

    "such an expansion can be conveniently written as @xmath154 where @xmath155 are constants to be determined .",

    "independently of what results from the sum on the left - hand side of eq . , the form of the quantities @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 ensures that the product @xmath159 is a function of @xmath160 .",
    "this means that @xmath40 changes its sign under the transformation @xmath161 , being an odd function of @xmath162 .",
