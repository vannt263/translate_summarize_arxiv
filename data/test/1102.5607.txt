    "in the scattering process , symmetry selection rules impose strong constraints on the symmetry properties of particles which participate in the process . resulting from the scalar property of the scattering operator in the three - phonon process,@xcite",

    "they can be obtained analogously for splitting process and will be listed at the end of this section .",
    "besides the energy conservation , the other selection rules are governed by the symmetry group of the system . for chiral , armchair , and zigzag swbnt(@xmath10,@xmath11 ) , the symmetry groups are the first , fourth , and eighth class of line group.@xcite the chiral swbnt have the screw symmetries and the pure rotational symmetries with generators @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "those phonons carry the information of the reflection symmetries ; thus , they are of higher symmetry than the other phonons . from group theory ,",
    "higher symmetry will lead to more complicate selection rules .",

    "these relations lead to an additional constraint on the selection rules of @xmath28 , which has been originally pointed out by dobardzic _",
    "et  al._@xcite , and demonstrated by lindsay _ et  al._@xcite    analogously , we can obtain the following selection rules for splitting process : @xmath38",
    "the interaction for the sp2 bn sheet or swbnt can be described by valence force field models in the linear approximation.@xcite this linear model can be adopted to study the ballistic phonon transport without phonon - phonon scattering . to investigate the thermal transport beyond the ballistic region ,",
    "it is necessary to apply a more realistic interatomic potential which can include the nonlinear effect and bond reaction phenomenon .",
    "several sets of parametric tersoff bond order potentials have been applied in the molecule dynamics simulation of various properties for bn materials.@xcite however , these parameters are not fitted to the sp2 bn sheet structure . especially , they are not good in the description of the phonon spectrum of bn sheet , which is crucial for the investigation of thermal transport in present work .",
    "it is important to fit a set of tersoff parameters to the phonon dispersion of sp2 bn sheet , as there is no experimental values for nonlinear properties of bn sheet .",
    "the fitting procedure is realized in following steps .",
    "firstly , the phonon dispersion in bn sheet is quite similar to that of the graphene , because these two materials have similar honeycomb structure .",
    "so we start with the tersoff parameters for carbon,@xcite with parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the tersoff potential rescaled by a factor of 0.3 .",
    "[ fig_bn_sheet ] ( dash line , blue online ) shows that this set of tersoff parameters give a good description of the four in - plane vibrations : longitudinal acoustic ( la ) , transverse acoustic ( ta ) , longitudinal optical ( lo ) , and transverse optical ( to ) modes .",
    "however , it results in much lower frequencies for the two out - of - plane vibrations : @xmath14 acoustic ( za ) and @xmath14 optical ( zo ) modes .",
    "we find that it is impossible to account for the in - plane and out - of - plane vibrations simultaneously through adjusting the parameters in tersoff potential where the bond order function depends on the bond length and in - plane bond angles .",

    "the in - plane longitudinal vibration and out - of - plane vibration are coupling together in the bond length term . as a result , it is impossible to modify tersoff parameters to independently affect the out - of - plane vibration while keep in - plane longitudinal vibration unchanged .",
    "et  al . _ solved this problem by generalizing the bond order function to be dihedral angle dependent,@xcite which can treat the out - of - plane vibrations separately .",
    "however , this is a numerically expensive generalization . particularly for large systems ,",
    "the numerical simulation using brenner potential becomes much slower than the tersoff potential .",
    "actually , this problem can be settled down by a more efficient and straightforward approach .",
    "we introduce a concise potential to manipulate the out - of - plane vibration separately .",
    "it should be noted that it is an attractive way to describe each degree of freedom by a separate term , as this can provide clear physical picture for each phonon branch . among various potentials , we find that the most stable one is the uffoop potential@xcite : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the dihedral angle .",

    "[ fig_bn_sheet ] ( solid line , red online ) shows that uffoop only enhances the out - of - plane vibration and does not affect the in - plane vibration at all in the planar bn sheet . for tubes , especially those with small diameters ,",
    "the dihedral angle @xmath42 depends on the curvature of the tube , so the out - of - plane and in - plane vibrations are mixing together by the uffoop potential .",
    "the phonon spectrum calculated from tersoff+uffoop potential agrees well with the experimental values .",
    "it should be noted however that the theoretical frequencies for lo and to modes do not coincide with experimental data in detail , since these two modes are more sensitive to long - range interactions compared with acoustic branches.@xcite the long - range interactions originate from the charge polarization of boron and nitride atoms in this ionic system . especially , the crossing of to and lo branches can not be repeated by the tersoff+uffoop potential .",
    "however , we can safely ignore the effect of long - range interaction in the study of phonon thermal transport , because the lo and to modes only contribute to thermal conductivity through providing new channels for phonon - phonon scattering of other phonons due to their low phonon velocity . at this point",

    "<S> we perform a theoretical investigation on the thermal conductivity of single - walled boron nitride nanotubes ( swbnt ) using the kinetic theory . by fitting to the phonon spectrum of boron nitride sheet , </S>",
    "<S> we develop an efficient and stable tersoff - derived interatomic potential which is suitable for the study of heat transport in sp2 structures . </S>",
    "<S> we work out the selection rules for the three - phonon process with the help of the helical quantum numbers @xmath0 attributed to the symmetry group ( line group ) of the swbnt . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation shows that the thermal conductivity @xmath1 diverges with length as @xmath2 with exponentially decaying @xmath3 , which results from the competition between boundary scattering and three - phonon scattering for flexure modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two flexure modes of the swbnt make dominant contribution to the thermal conductivity , because their zero frequency locates at @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rotational angle of the screw symmetry in swbnt . </S>"
