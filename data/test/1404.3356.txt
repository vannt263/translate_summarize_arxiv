    "over the last fifteen years there has been a surge of studies in anomalous diffusion , characterized by the deviation of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath5 of a stochastic process with the probability density function @xmath1 to find the particle at position @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , from the linear time dependence @xmath8 of ordinary brownian motion @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion is usually characterized in terms of the power - law form @xmath9 with the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath10 of physical dimension @xmath11 and the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath12 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath12 we distinguish subdiffusion ( @xmath13 ) and superdiffusion ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .    since the milestone discoveries of superdiffusion in turbulence already in 1926 @xcite and of subdiffusion in amorphous semiconductors @xcite the recent vast increase of interest in anomalous diffusion is due to its discovery in numerous microscopic systems , in particular in biological contexts .",
    "the cytoplasm of biological cells is heavily crowded with various obstacles , including proteins , nucleic acids , ribosomes , the cytoskeleton , as well as internal membranes compartmentalizing the cell @xcite .",
    "diffusion of natural and artificial tracers in this complex environment is often subdiffusive .",
    "similar situations are encountered in cell membranes @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for subdiffusion in the crowded cytoplasm of living cells ranges from the motion of small labeled proteins @xcite over mrna molecules and chromosomal loci @xcite , lipid and insulin granules @xcite , virus particles @xcite , as well as chromosomal telomeres @xcite and cajal bodies @xcite inside the nucleus .",
    "subdiffusion was observed for membrane resident proteins experimentally @xcite and for membrane lipid molecules in computer simulations @xcite . in",
    "controlled _ in vitro _",
    "experiments with artificial crowders , anomalous diffusion was consistently observed @xcite . on larger scales anomalous diffusion",
    "was observed , for instance , for the motion of bacteria in a biofilm @xcite .",
    "the observed subdiffusion was ascribed to various physical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "apart from the apparent transient anomalous diffusion caused by a crossover from free normal diffusion to the plateau value of the msd @xcite , typically , three main families of anomalous diffusion processes are considered : ( i ) diffusion in a fractal environment where dead ends and bottlenecks slow down the motion on all scales @xcite ; ( ii ) motion in a viscoelastic environment , in which the effective anomalous motion of the tracer particle in the correlated many - body environment shows long - ranged antipersistent motion @xcite .",
    "the latter process is associated with fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and generalized langevin equation motion with a power - law memory form of the friction kernel @xcite .",
    "( iii ) and continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) models , in which the moving particle is successively trapped by binding events to the environment or caging effects for waiting times @xmath15 distributed like a power - law @xmath16 with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "all three mechanisms lead to the power - law msd ( [ msd ] ) and they were indeed identified as processes generating the motion of different tracers in different cellular environments @xcite or in colloidal systems _ in vitro _ @xcite .",
    "these three anomalous diffusion mechanisms characterized by anomalous diffusion with a constant in time generalized diffusivity were identified in experiments involving fairly large endogenous as well as artificial tracers .",
    "recent experiments on eukaryotic cells @xcite using considerably smaller tracer proteins sampling over much larger subvolumes of the cell indicated a systematic variation of the cytoplasmic diffusivity with the separation from the cell nucleus .",
    "these spatial diffusivity gradients are due partly to the non - uniform distribution of crowders in the cytoplasm .",
    "this distribution can non - trivially affect the diffusion of tracers of different sizes in the cell cytoplasm . _ in vitro _ , fast gradients of the diffusivity can be realized , for instance , via a local variation of the temperature in thermophoresis experiments @xcite , as sketched in fig .",

    "the diffusion of water molecules monitored by diffusive magnetic resonance imaging in the brain white matter was demonstrated to be heterogeneous and strongly anisotropic @xcite .",

    "the existence of a population splitting into two pools of water molecules with slow and fast diffusivities was shown for brain white matter @xcite .",
    "finally , spatial heterogeneities are also abundant in the completely different context of anomalous diffusion in subsurface hydrology @xcite .    .",

    "we pay particular attention to a phenomenon , that recently received considerable attention for its immediate relevance to the surging field of single particle tracking experiments in microscopic systems , namely , the so - called _ weak ergodicity breaking_. this is the distinct disparity between physical observables depending on whether they are evaluated in the conventional ensemble sense or , from measured time series @xmath19 of the particle position , in terms of time averages @xcite .",
    "we find that the hdp process gives rise to weakly non - ergodic behavior with a pronounced amplitude scatter of the time averaged msd of individual trajectories .",

    "as the power @xmath4 in @xmath133 deviates from zero , the non - gaussianity parameter reveals a rich behavior as a function of the lag time @xmath37 and the initial position @xmath17 .",
    "more specifically , in the region @xmath26 the non - gaussianity parameter progressively grows and reaches considerably large values for large @xmath2 , see the curve for @xmath134 in fig .",
    "[ fig - non - gauss]a .",
    "the value @xmath127 systematically decreases with the lag time @xmath37 along the trace for negative @xmath4 . in the region @xmath135",
    "the value of @xmath100 also grows with @xmath4 but , in contrast to the case @xmath26 , the function @xmath127 stays rather constant with @xmath37 . as we approach the critical @xmath3 the non - gaussianity parameter reaches very high values . in the region @xmath73 the value of @xmath127 decreases again .",
    "these features of the functional behavior of @xmath136 correspond with the properties of @xmath137 , compare the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - non - gauss]a and [ fig - eb - lag]a .",
    "note that similar to @xmath84 the statistics required to obtain a smooth curve for @xmath127 strongly depends on @xmath4 : the result from @xmath50 traces in fig .",
    "[ fig - non - gauss]a acquires pronouncedly higher fluctuations when we approach the critical value @xmath3 .",
    "we find that variations in the initial positions @xmath17 only have a marginal effect on @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - non - gauss]b we illustrate the range of @xmath100 values for exponents in the range @xmath139 . even for the wide range from @xmath71 to @xmath140 the value of @xmath128",
    "does not reveal any appreciable variation , in stark contrast to the strong @xmath17-dependence of @xmath141 .",
    "this indicates that for the hdp the non - gaussianity parameter is more robust than @xmath84 with respect to the choice of the initial condition . in fig .",
    "[ fig - non - gauss]b the dashed line indicates the proportionality to @xmath142 , which nicely matches the measured shape of @xmath138 .",
    "we finally analyze the time evolution of the pdf of the particle position in fig .",
    "[ fig - spread ] for three different values of the scaling exponent @xmath4 , distinguishing superdiffusion ( top row for @xmath68 , i.e. , ballistic motion with @xmath143 ) , normal diffusion ( middle row for @xmath53 and @xmath115 ) , and subdiffusion ( bottom row for @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath145 ) .",
    "in each row the leftmost panel represents a very early evolution of the pdf close to the initial condition , while in the rightmost panel the pdf in some of the cases has almost reached the diffusion limit , in which the analytical asymptote ( [ pdf - hdp ] ) is valid .",
    "we observe that for hdps with positive @xmath4 , i.e. , when the diffusivity @xmath18 grows with the modulus of the position , the pdf for particles with an initial position far away from the origin , an asymmetric shape of the pdf is effected .",
    "namely , they progressively move towards regions of small diffusivity and accumulate there .",
    "this focusing due to the quenched nature of the diffusivity erases any memory of the initial condition and the common asymptote ( [ pdf - hdp ] ) of stretched gaussian shape ( @xmath135 ) is approached . in the opposite case with negative",
    "@xmath4 the focusing of particles in lower diffusivity regions applies again , albeit at longer times than shown here .",
    "this time , however , instead of the cusp at the origin for positive @xmath4 , the pdf drops down to zero at the origin and acquires the bimodal shape predicted by ( [ pdf - hdp ] ) , a compressed gaussian . for the brownian case with vanishing @xmath4 ,",
    "no focusing takes place . in the final panel",
    "the distribution is already so broad that the individual , shifted pdfs appear on top of each other .",
    "similarly to the evolution of the msd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - msd - tamsd - alfa ] , the relaxation time required for the system of diffusing particles to approach this long - time limit , @xmath1 depends on the power @xmath4 of the diffusivity in eq .",
    "( [ eq - dx ] ) . for more negative @xmath4 values",
    "the traces are not yet relaxed to the theoretical long - time shape even after @xmath91 steps .",
    "the particles starting at larger @xmath17 remain trapped for the whole length of the simulation .",
    "conversely , when the diffusivity increases fast away from the origin ( moderate positive @xmath4 values ) , the equilibration to the long - time pdf is relatively fast , see the panel for @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig - spread ] .",
    "for hpd processes whose diffusivity @xmath18 varies in power - law form with the distance @xmath6 from the origin and which give rise to anomalous diffusion we analyzed in detail the weakly non - ergodic behavior for varying power exponents @xmath4 and initial positions @xmath17 of the particles . in particular",
    ", we examined the functional dependencies and magnitudes of the variation of the ensemble and time averaged characteristics of such hdps with these parameters .",
    "the fluctuations of the amplitude of the time averaged msd of individual time traces were shown to systematically grow with increasing departure of the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath33 from the brownian value @xmath115 , corresponding to the scaling exponent @xmath53 in the power - law form for @xmath18 .",
    "the fluctuations increase dramatically when the scaling exponent approaches its critical value @xmath3 . at that critical point",
    "we corroborated the turnover from the power - law scaling in time of the msd to an exponential growth .",
    "beyond the critical point the fluctuations of the time averaged msd become smaller again .",
    "concurrently we observe a distinct population splitting into a faster and slower fraction of time averaged msds .",
    "we paid particular emphasis on several parameters used to classify the departure from ergodic behavior , namely the two ergodicity breaking parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 as well as the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath100 .",
    "while @xmath146 is simply defined as the ratio of the mean time averaged msd versus the msd , both @xmath84 and @xmath100 are based on the fourth order moments of the particle position and are known analytically only from approximate theories . a detailed numerical analysis of their properties was therefore used to obtain more concrete information on their behavior for different values of the scaling exponent @xmath4 and the initial particle position @xmath17 in the heterogeneous environment @xcite .",
    "within the analyzed parameter range we find that the behavior of @xmath147 is indeed in agreement with the heuristic theoretical analysis from ref .",
    "the parameter portraits for the ergodicity breaking and non - gaussianity parameters obtained from our numerical analysis will be useful for actual data evaluation",
    ". we also explored the detailed behavior of the hdp dynamics at the critical value @xmath3 and its vicinity , in particular with respect to the dramatic values reached by @xmath84 reflecting the dramatic fluctuations of the time averaged msd .",
    "a systematic numerical analysis of the particle pdf for varying initial conditions @xmath17 sheds additional light on hdps with different exponent @xmath4 , in particular , the visualization of the particle focusing in low diffusivity regions .    in hdps",
    "the non - ergodic behavior arises due to the heterogeneity of the environment .",
    "physically , this represents a space - dependent mobility or temperature .",
    "it is not a property of the particle , and each time the particle revisits a given point @xmath6 in space it has the same diffusivity @xmath18 . in a random walk sense , this scenario could also be translated into a local dependence of the waiting time for a jump event . in that interpretation",
    "the hdp corresponds to a motion in a quenched energy landscape @xcite , albeit a deterministic ( in contrast to random ) one .",
    "as such , the process is intrinsically different from renewal ctrw processes , which correspond to the motion in an annealed environment @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we observed that subdiffusive hdps share a number of features with subdiffusive ctrws with scale - free , power - law waiting time distribution .",
    "these features include the scaling laws for the ensemble and time averaged msds , and the form of the ergodicity breaking parameter @xmath85 ( in the relevant range @xmath45 ) . from the sole analysis of the msds @xmath51 and @xmath40 as well as the ergodicity breaking parameters , a significant distinction between ctrw and hdp",
    "is therefore difficult . yet there",
    "exist some crucial differences between the hdp and ctrw processes , that can be measured .",
    "thus , in hdps with @xmath45 the distribution @xmath57 of the relative amplitude @xmath40 of individual realizations decays to zero at @xmath61 , in contrast to the ctrw s finite fraction of immobile particles reflected in the finite value @xmath148 .",
    "indeed the scatter distribution @xmath57 was previously advocated as a good diagnosis tool for different stochastic processes @xcite , complementing other stochastic analysis methods @xcite .",
    "hdps are physically meaningful alternatives to the standard stochastic models for anomalous diffusion processes , namely , the ctrw process with long - tailed waiting time distribution , fbm and fractional langevin equation motion based on gaussian yet long - ranged in time correlations , diffusion in fractal environments , or their combinations @xcite .",
    "hpds are weakly non - ergodic , sharing some yet not all properties of ctrw processes .",
    "it is therefore important to explore the properties of hdps in more detail in the future as well as to develop more sophisticated tools to interpret measured time series and with confidence identify the underlying stochastic mechanism . in particular",
    ", we will study the properties of confined and aged hdps as well as spatially varying diffusivities with a random component , and the coupling of hdps with active motion .",
