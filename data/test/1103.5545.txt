    "a quantum walk ( qw)@xcite describes quantum mechanical time evolution of particles , which is identified as a random walk when the system is brought to the classical limit . the qw may provide a unique avenue to realize quantum computation since the qw can be applied for efficient algorithms of quantum computation.@xcite among several kinds of qws , the two - state discrete - time qw in one dimension ( 1d ) has been intensively investigated due to its simple formalism .",

    "clarified that the dirac equation derived from the 1d qw with chiral symmetry gives a finite berry phase and thus generates edge states near boundaries , since 1d chiral classes can be characterized by an integer topological number@xcite .",

    "the sign of the reflecting coin operator determines the presence or absence of edge states.@xcite in case of the hadamard walks ( @xmath28 ) , the edge states appear if @xmath29 is introduced at the boundary .",
    "we now consider the hadamard walks with @xmath29 at the origin as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbc ] .",
    "the initial state is prepared as @xmath30 throughout the paper , so that the right and left walkers do not mix with each other due to real - number elements of the coin operator and then the probability distribution becomes symmetric in the absence of spatial disorder .",

    "[ fig : dos ] ( d ) .",
    "we find that the divergence becomes stronger with increasing @xmath60 and the dos for the smallest disorder ( @xmath72 ) shows the oscillating behavior .",
    "this oscillation reminds us of the dos derived from chiral random matrix theories.@xcite indeed , a system belonging to the 1d chiral class is known to show an anderson transition at _ zero energy _ , which is accompanied by the divergence in the dos.@xcite",
    "although the energy at which the dos diverges is different from what we observed for the qw , we claim that _ the anderson transition in the 1d chiral class occurs in the spatially disordered qw at @xmath73_. this is supported by the following symmetry arguments .",
    "chiral symmetry gives a constraint that eigenenergies appear in pairs of opposite sign and this makes the zero energy states in chiral classes singular . in the qws ,",
    "chiral symmetry leads to the eigenvalues of @xmath9 appearing in pairs like @xmath74 .",

    "we therefore come to the conclusion that the anderson transition of the 1d chiral class should occur at @xmath71 even if there are energy gaps and the edge states exist at @xmath56 .    according to universality , the same critical behaviors near zero energy studied with a tight - binding hamiltonian in ref .",

    "( [ eq : initial ] ) , but also for general delta function like initial states , so that dynamics of qws is described by the whole eigen states .",
    "we mention that since the coin operator of the previous works for the 1d spatially disordered qws @xcite does not retain chiral symmetry , the anderson transition is not found and only the anderson localized states are confirmed .",
    "it is known for zero energy states of chiral classes@xcite and various topological insulators , such as the integer quantum hall transition , that topologically protected edge states stably exist unless the bulk band gap is closed .",
    "when a symmetry - preserving perturbation collapses the bulk gap , the delocalized states which can be coupled with the edge states so that the topological number is changed should appear even in 1d disordered systems .",
    "in other words , the existence of the delocalized states as the anderson delocalization is essential to topological phases in disordered systems .",
    "it is naturally expected , then , that the 1d qw with chiral symmetry also follows a similar fashion under the spatial disorder of @xmath41 .    here ,",
    "we clarify how the strong spatial disorder @xmath60 induces the delocalized states at @xmath56 as a consequence of the gap closing .",
    "figure [ fig : dos ] ( b ) indicates that the bulk gaps around @xmath56 become smaller with increasing @xmath60 , though there still remain the edge states at @xmath98 .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to find the gap closing from the dos since the finite system calculation keeps the mean level spacing finite .",

    "this suggests that the bulk gap around @xmath58 is closed .",
    "figure [ fig : dos ] ( c ) shows the dos @xmath52 at @xmath99 .",

    "we note that the hamiltonian of the 1d continuous - time qw possessing chiral symmetry is the tight - binding model with only nearest neighbor random hopping terms . indeed , the latter model is consistent with the one studied in ref .  , and the anderson transition is possible only at zero energy in contrast to the discrete - time qws studied in the present work . therefore , the coexistence of edge states and the anderson transition is peculiar to discrete - time qws .",
    "we also mention that , although we have been concerned with the qws with @xmath48 here , our conclusion can directly be applied for the qws without @xmath48 , except for the argument on edge states at @xmath56 .    in summary , we have investigated two - state discrete time qws belonging to the 1d chiral orthogonal class in the presence of spatial or temporal disorder .",
    "we have elucidated that anderson transitions in the 1d chiral classes occur at @xmath71 in the qws with any strength of spatial disorder and thereby the qws can avoid the complete localization .",
    "we note that , while the currently available experiments on discrete - time qws can accomplish only a few ten time steps and it may difficult to completely eliminate the temporal disorder giving rise to decoherence in the spatially disordered qws , the delocalization behavior found in the present work will be observed when the technology of qws will be further developed in the application of quantum computer .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the coexistence of edge , localized , and delocalized states is realized in the time evolution of the spatially disordered qw with @xmath107 .",
    "this characteristic nature of the qws is supported by chiral symmetry of @xmath10 and bipartite structures of @xmath9 .",
