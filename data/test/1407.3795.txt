    "baryons and dm also had different _",

[ eq : r_virbl ] ) of the just - collapsed dm halo .",
    "for example , a @xmath0 fluctuation with @xmath74  m@xmath3 collapses with a spatial offset exactly equal to the virial radius of its dm halo .",
    "clumps with smaller mass ( larger wavenumber ) form outside the virial radius , and vice versa . in the case of a @xmath1 fluctuation ,",

    "figure [ fig : delx ] shows that baryon clumps with @xmath83  m@xmath3 may be able to survive destruction by either dynamical friction or evaporation , and may survive as independent long - lived clumps .",
    "these may be the objects we see today as gcs .",
    "furthermore , their parent dm halos , which collapsed with a deficit of baryons , may today be ultra - faint galaxies and dark satellite galaxies .",
    "while the above proposal seems attractive , could baryon clumps in the favorable mass range @xmath84 fall into their parent dm halos simply through the gravitational pull of the latter .",
    "the free - fall time from a separation @xmath71 is very short : @xmath85 ( note : a @xmath0 fluctuation of @xmath86 has a physical separation of @xmath87  kpc from its dm host . )",
    "the actual timescale is a little longer since the baryon clump will begin with an outward velocity ( hubble flow ) .",
    "however , this changes the result by less than a factor of two .",
    "newly - formed baryon and dm clumps will certainly free - fall and merge if they evolve in isolation . more often , however , we expect the two objects to participate in the hierarchical growth of structure in the universe .",
    "at least some baryon clumps that collapse outside the virial radius of their dm parent halos will experience strong tidal forces from neighboring objects and will become gravitationally unbound from their dm halos .",
    "it remains to be seen if a sufficient number can survive by this mechanism to explain the gcs we observe in the current universe .",
    "fluctuations , which collapse at redshifts well below @xmath88 ( according to our analysis ) , whereas their numerical simulation was limited to @xmath89 . furthermore , because of low statistical sampling , they were unable to follow the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "this may explain why they did not see any baryon - only clumps such as we predict . ]",
    "we have used linear theory to study the growth of baryonic and dm density fluctuations in the universe in the presence of a stream velocity @xmath29 between the two components .",
    "we focused on the fact that a non - zero stream velocity causes a phase shift @xmath33 between the complex amplitudes of the baryonic and dm density fluctuations , which results in a spatial separation between the two density peaks .",
    "when the perturbations go non - linear and collapse , the baryon clump forms at a different spatial location than its dm counterpart . for baryon clump masses less than about few @xmath90 , the separation is larger than the virial radius of the dm halo .",
    "assuming tidal forces from other nearby objects are able to unbind the baryon clump from its dm halo , the clump could survive to the present day as a dm - free gravitationally self - bound object .",
    "we suggest that this may be how gcs formed in the universe .",
    "the corresponding baryon - deficient dm halos would similarly survive as dark satellite galaxies or ultra - faint galaxies , as suggested previously by @xcite .",
    "note that , in this picture , the collapse of a baryon clump is not driven purely by the self - gravity of the baryons .",
    "the primary driving agent is still the dm perturbation , whose effect on the baryons is nearly the same as in the standard ( @xmath91 ) model of structure formation , so long as the phase shift @xmath33 is less than about a radian . for perturbations that satisfy this condition , baryonic collapse is almost as effective as in the standard model , and gravity is able to overcome gas pressure ; the only difference is that the baryon and dm clumps form in spatially distinct locations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phases ] we showed phase and spatial offsets between the baryon and dm perturbations for linear modes with different wavenumbers @xmath47 . as an example , at @xmath92 , a mode with @xmath93mpc@xmath8 ( which corresponds to a baryonic mass @xmath94  m@xmath3 ) , has a phase shift @xmath95 , which translates to a comoving distance between the baryon and dm density peaks of 7.3kpc . a @xmath0 fluctuation with this @xmath47 collapses at @xmath92 ( fig .  [ fig : sigma ] ) , and the spatial offset between the baryonic and dm clumps is about @xmath96 times the virial radius of the dm halo . for a @xmath1 fluctuation",
    ", collapse occurs at an earlier redshift and the separation is even larger .    using the virial radius of the dm halo as a benchmark spatial separation to discriminate between baryon clumps that survive and those that merge through dynamical friction",
    ", we obtain a natural upper cutoff to the mass of baryon - only clumps of a few@xmath97 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delx ] ) .",
    "there is similarly a natural lower cutoff at around @xmath98 , which arises from a combination of several effects : survival against evaporation of stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delx ] ) , jeans cutoff due to gas pressure , and too large a phase shift between baryons and dm ( which is a serious effect for @xmath99 a few hundred mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "the resulting mass range of long - lived clumps , @xmath100 , agrees well with the masses of present - day gcs . ) , a @xmath101  m@xmath3 baryon clump would still have produced enough stars to make it an attractive candidate progenitor for present - day gcs .",
    "the topic of star formation in our baryon - only clumps is beyond the scope of this paper . ]",
    "note that all the numerical estimates given in this paper are for @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "the range extends to larger masses for @xmath102 ; @xmath103 is equivalent to @xmath30 , but @xmath104 has no stream velocity effect ( within linear theory ) .",
    "a great deal of work is needed before one can be confident that the baryon - only clumps discussed here can indeed form naturally and that they are sufficiently long - lived to be interesting . within an analytical approach",
    ", one has to consider higher - order non - linear techniques .",
    "alternatively , a numerical approach is possible , but it will require much better mass resolution than one usually finds in galaxy formation simulations .",
    "assuming one successfully demonstrates that the baryon clumps proposed here form and are long - lived , one must test whether or not stars will form inside the collapsed clumps , and whether a sufficient number of stars will survive down to @xmath105 with the correct spatial and metallicity distribution .",
    "these are challenging problems .",
    "finally we note that , even for baryonic ( and dm ) masses much larger than those discussed here ( arising from modes with @xmath106 ) , there is a significant spatial offset between the baryons and dm at the time of collapse ( @xmath107kpc , depending on the redshift , fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ) .",
    "these baryon and dm clumps will quickly merge through dynamical friction .",
    "however , in the process , the baryons will likely cause substantial stirring of the dm fluid in the inner regions of the halo .",
    "this might well produce a core - like structure in the dm density distribution , potentially explaining a number of puzzling observations ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "also , as figure  [ fig : phases ] indicates , the spatial offset @xmath71 evolves significantly with the redshift of formation .",
    "this means that galaxies that formed at higher redshifts are likely to have smaller dark matter cores , and their baryonic components will also be more compact , compared to galaxies that formed more recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
