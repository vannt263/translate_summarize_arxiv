    "evolutionary game theory ( egt ) is becoming a general theoretical framework to analysis strategies behaviors @xcite .",
    "egt is rooted in the classical game theory ( cgt ) @xcite and the theory of evolution @xcite .",
    "different from cgt , egt predicts there could exist persistent cycles in the evolutionary trajectories in the strategy space @xcite .    as an example",
    "let us consider the standard rock - paper - scissors ( rps ) game .",
    "this is a prototype game in textbooks @xcite . in this game ,",
    "dynamics equations ( e.g. , the standard replicator dynamics equations ) in egt predict that the evolutionary trajectory will cycle around the nash equilibrium persistently .",
    "however , the cgt predicts full random behavior : the system is in a mixed - strategy equilibrium with each cyclic motion being balanced completely by its reverse cyclic motion . according to the cgt theory , cycles ( also referred to as excess loops )",
    "can not be observed in the evolutionary trajectories in the long run  @xcite .",
    "empirical examples of the rps cycles are constantly being discovered in nature , e.g. , three morphs male lizard  @xcite and others @xcite . the environment for animal contests is decentralized , in which the encounter is pairwise , but population strategy shows cyclic behaviors @xcite . in general , human economic behaviors ( e.g. , exchanges ) are also pairwise and not centralized @xcite .",
    "to test egt in human game experiments  @xcite , the traditional setting is decentralized ( see review  @xcite ) , in which a subject in each round competes with one random - pairwise opponent within a finite population @xcite . in such traditional setting experiment , whether the trajectories are persistent cycles instead of convergence to a nash equilibrium remains an open question  @xcite .",
    "till now , no persistent cycle has been confirmed in the rps experiment under such a traditional setting @xcite , and furthermore no dynamics observation has been reported quantitatively .    in this paper",
    "we study the evolutionary trajectories of the rock - paper - scissors game from the perspective of non - equilibrium statistical physics . in non - equilibrium statistical physics studies , formulating a physically meaningful measure of the distance from equilibrium is an area of active research  @xcite .",
    "an equilibrium system satisfies the detailed balance condition , which ensures the time reversal symmetry . however , detailed balance is broken in a non - equilibrium system even in its stationary state , therefore various dynamical patterns may show up in the evolutionary trajectory .",
    "several non - equilibrium order parameters , such as entropy production  @xcite and velocity  @xcite , have been constructed to characterize the distance from equilibrium . in this work",
    "we carry out laboratory experiments on the rps game , and we detect the possible existence of persistent cyclic flows using an angular frequency as the non - equilibrium order parameter .",
    "a non - zero angular frequency serves as a quantitative measure of the distance from equilibrium for the evolutionary trajectories .",
    "we also compare our experimental observations with the predictions of a simple non - equilibrium model , the discrete - time logit dynamical process with a noise parameter @xmath2 .",
    "our experiments are the standard rps games with the experimental setting of discrete time , random pairwise matching and local information .",
    "this setting has its reality in biology and economics @xcite .",
    "we collect a total number of twelve experimental trajectories from our experiments ( each trajectory is the result of @xmath3 rounds of the game ) and then analyze these trajectories . like other previous experiments @xcite and theories @xcite ,",
    "the evolutionary trajectories are highly stochastic , but using our non - equilibrium order parameter we are able to confirm that cycles exist and do not dissipate .",
    "the mean frequency of cycles is about @xmath1 period per experimental round .",
    "this mean value is used to evaluate the noise parameter @xmath2 of the logit dynamics model , and a value of @xmath4 is obtained .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in the next section",
    "we introduce the standard rps game in the traditional setting and describe our data analysis protocol . in section [ sec : results ] we describe our main experimental results .",
    "the experimental results are compared with the predictions of the discrete - time logit dynamics model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "we conclude this work in the last section .",
    "there are three different pure strategies in the rock - paper - scissors game , namely rock ( @xmath5 ) , paper ( @xmath5 ) and scissors ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these three strategies form a directed circle @xmath7 , namely @xmath5 beats @xmath6 , @xmath6 beats @xmath8 , and @xmath8 in turn beats @xmath5 . in our experiments we use the simple payoff matrix shown in table  [ rpspaoffmatrix ] to make the rps game a constant - sum game",
    ": in each play between two players , the winning player gets a payoff @xmath9 ( i.e. , two experimental points ) while the losing player gets a payoff @xmath10 ; if there is a tie then each player gets an equal payoff @xmath11 .",
    ".[rpspaoffmatrix ] payoff matrix of the rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "the value of each matrix element is the payoff of the row player s strategy given the strategy of the column player . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the last four rows are the statistical results of the @xmath12 experimental groups above . the row titled as @xmath13-value is @xmath14-test result by setting the null hypothesis @xmath15 for the @xmath12 samples .",
    "95%u(l ) means the upper ( lower ) bound of @xmath16 confidence interval over the @xmath12 samples .",
    "to theoretically understand the experimental observations , we now study a noisy best - response process as a simple model for the rps game , namely the discrete - time logit dynamics @xcite .",
    "multiple equilibria and limit cycles in the logit dynamics has also been studied in a very recent paper by hommes and ochea @xcite in the continuous - time limit .",
    "suppose the population of @xmath17 players is in the social state @xmath18 after the @xmath14-th round of the game .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 the mean payoff of the strategy @xmath20 for this social state . from the payoff matrix of table [ rpspaoffmatrix ]",
    "we can easily obtain that @xmath21 we assume that at the @xmath22-round of the game , each player of the population will choose a strategy from @xmath23 independently of all the other players . and",

    "consider two social states @xmath18 and @xmath30 on the evolutionary trajectory at two consecutive time points @xmath14 and @xmath47 . if either @xmath18 or @xmath30 is identical to the nash equilibrium point , the transition @xmath48 is _ not _ a rotational motion around the nash equilibrium , and we set the corresponding rotational angle @xmath49 to be zero .",
    "the nash equilibrium point may be sitting on the rectilinear line that passing through the social states @xmath18 and @xmath50 .",
    "if this is the case , the transition @xmath51 is also _ not _ a rotational motion around the nash equilibrium , and its rotational angle @xmath49 is again set to be zero . in all the remaining cases , the social states @xmath18 , @xmath30 and the nash equilibrium point form a triangle in the social state plane of fig .",
    "[ fig:28state ] .",
    "the magnitude of the rotational angle @xmath49 is just the angle of this triangle at vertex point @xmath52 , it must be less than @xmath53 .",

    "the mean frequency @xmath44 that the evolution trajectory rotates around the nash equilibrium point can then be computed by the following formula @xmath55     probability of staying in the social state @xmath42 for a population of size @xmath0 .",
    "the horizontal axis is the predicted probability by the discrete - time logit dynamics model with inverse temperature @xmath56 , while the vertical axis is the empirical probability measured from the @xmath12 experimental trajectories . because of",
    "the rotational symmetry ( [ eq : rotation ] ) , the @xmath57 social states can be coarse - grained into ten groups : ( 1 ) , @xmath58 ; ( 2 ) , @xmath59 ; ( 3 ) , @xmath60 ; ( 4 ) , @xmath61 ; ( 5 ) , @xmath62 ; ( 6 ) , @xmath63 ; ( 7 ) , @xmath64 ; ( 8) , @xmath65 ; ( 9 ) , @xmath66 ; ( 10 ) , @xmath67 .",

    "the mean cycling frequencies of these simulated evolutionary trajectories are also shown in fig .",

    ", we also perform computer simulations based on the discrete - time logic dynamics model to generate a set of independent evolution trajectories of length @xmath70 .",
    "we then perform the same analysis on these trajectories and find that the direction of the cycles is counter - clockwise and the mean cycling frequency is @xmath71 , consistent with the experimental result .    at @xmath72 , the steady - state probability @xmath33 of visiting each social state @xmath18 as predicted by the logit dynamics",
    "is compared with the empirically observed probability of visiting @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wvalues ] .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is again very good .",
    "although the discrete - time noisy - response logit dynamic model can describe our experimental observations excellently , we should point out an important difference between the model assumption and the experimental setting . in our experiments , after each round of the game , each player only knows the strategy of her / his opponent but not the social state of the whole population .",
    "however in the logit dynamics model , we assume that each player choose a strategy based on the knowledge of the current social state of the population , see eq .",
    "( [ logitdyn ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "the logit dynamics model is still a phenomenological model .",
    "it is of interest to quantitatively describe the rps evolutionary dynamics by a more microscopic model .",
    "we hope to return to this issue in a future study .",
    "as a brief summary , in this work we studied the rock - paper - scissors game both experimentally and analytically .",
    "our experimental data gave strong evidence that counter - clockwise cycles around the nash equilibrium point exist in the social - state evolutionary trajectory of a finte population .",
    "we demonstrated that our experimental observations can be quantitatively understood by a simple theoretical model of noisy - response logit dynamics .",
    "rps game experiments on egt were also reported quite recently by cason and co - authors and by hoffman and co - authors @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds and cutting edges of the experiment research are well documented in these two references @xcite .",
    "compared with the decentralized setting of our present work , the experimental environments of the rps game in these two recent works @xcite are all centralized : instead of pairwise meetings , in all of the experiments reported in @xcite , each subject competes against the choices of all other subjects .",
    "however , the decentralized setting ( especially the random matching pairwise setting ) is more closer to the natural environments in biology and economics ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the encounters of male lizards are pairwise meetings  @xcite . for decentralized population",
    "rps games , according to our knowledge , the existence of persistent cyclic motions was not confirmed by any previous laboratory experiments .",
    "going back to traditional ( decentralized ) setting experiments of the simplest rps game , the present work added strong evidence in favor of the existence of persistent cycles . as a fundamental observation on cycle , the mean frequency of cycles was quantitatively meassured .",
    "there are tens of dynamics models which have been build to interpret cyclic behavior in rps game , however there are rare quantitative observations from real experiments .",
    "quantitative measurements from experiments is important , without which to evaluate a dynamics equation precisely is almost impossible ( or plausible ) .",
    "as demonstrated , our experimental observations can be quantitatively understood by a simple theoretical model of noisy - response logit dynamics .",
    "we wish to emphasize two major points of our experimental approach .",
    "first , by recording sufficiently long evolutionary trajectories , we were able to detect weak deterministic motion in a highly stochastic process .",
    "we noticed that cycles can only be confirmed ( @xmath73 ) when the trajectories are longer than @xmath74 rounds in twelve samples .",
    "second , we focus on time asymmetry of social state transitions .",
    "importance of time asymmetry has been well emphasised in non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "the frequency is observed from the loops out of detailed balance .",
