    "the wiretap channel was first introduced by wyner @xcite , in which a legitimate transmitter ( alice ) wishes to send messages to a legitimate receiver ( bob ) secretly in the presence of an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",

    "later , csiszr and krner @xcite characterized the capacity equivocation region for general , not necessarily degraded , wiretap channels .",
    "these works are based on information - theoretic random coding schemes .",
    "polar coding , invented by arikan @xcite , is the first code that provably achieves the capacity of the binary - input discrete symmetric output channels ( b - dmc ) .",
    "the idea of polar coding has been extended to lossless source coding @xcite , lossy source coding @xcite , and to multi - user scenarios , such as , multiple access channel @xcite , broadcast channel @xcite , interference channel @xcite , and slepian - wolf coding problem @xcite .    on a b - dmc",
    ", polarization results in two kinds of sub - channels @xcite .",
    "the first kind is good sub - channels . the capacity for these sub - channels approaches @xmath0 bit per channel use .",
    "the second kind is bad sub - channels .",
    "the channel output for these sub - channels is independent of the channel input ; therefore the capacity for these sub - channels approaches @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "if a b - dmc a is degraded with respect to a b - dmc b , then the good sub - channels of a must be a subset of the good sub - channels of b @xcite .",
    "we call this the _ subset property_.    polar coding schemes for _ degraded _ wiretap channels with",
    "_ symmetric _",
    "main and eavesdropper channels are developed using the subset property in @xcite .",
    "for degraded wiretap channels , the good sub - channels of eve is a subset of the good sub - channels of bob .",
    "the polar coding scheme is designed to transmit the confusion messages ( random bits ) on the sub - channels simultaneously good for bob and eve , and to transmit the secret messages on the sub - channels only good for bob . however , for non - degraded wiretap channels , the subset property no longer holds @xcite , i.e. , the good sub - channels of eve is not necessary a subset of the good sub - channels of bob .",
    "moreover , the secrecy capacity achieving input distribution is not necessarily a uniform distribution .",
    "therefore , the polar coding schemes in @xcite can not directly extend to the non - degraded wiretap channel .    by applying the two recently developed techniques for polar codes",
    ", we can achieve the secrecy capacity of the general wiretap channel .",
    "the first is universal polar codes @xcite .",
    "universal polar coding allows us to align the good sub - channels of bob and eve together .",
    "therefore , we can artificially construct the subset property for the non - degraded wiretap channel .",
    "then , alice transmits the random bits on the sub - channels simultaneously good for bob and eve , and the secret message on the sub - channels only good for bob .",
    "the second is polar coding for asymmetric models @xcite , which allows us to deal with the non - uniform input distribution .",
    "different from b - dmc , polarization for asymmetric channel results in three different kinds of sub - channels .",
    "another polar coding scheme for the general wiretap channel is provided in @xcite , which uses a concatenated code consisting of two polar codes .",
    "the inner layer ensures that the transmitted message can be reliably decoded by bob , and the outer layer guarantees that the message is kept secret from eve .",
    "our work jointly handles these two goals in one shot .",
    "hence , the decoding error probability of our scheme is approximately @xmath2 , whereas it is @xmath3 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , for practical code construction , there is still no efficient way to characterize the outer index set ( * ? ? ?",

    "a wiretap channel consists of a legitimate transmitter ( alice ) who wishes to send messages to a legitimate receiver ( bob ) secretly in the presence of an the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
