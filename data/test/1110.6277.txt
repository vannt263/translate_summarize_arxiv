    "ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are extragalactic , point - like , off nuclear x - ray sources with observed isotropic x - ray luminosities higher than the eddington luminosity for accretion onto a 10 @xmath0 black hole , and typically in the range from @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 up to @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest that the majority of ulxs are accreting black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with massive donors ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    at present , the size and the origin of the bhs hosted in ulxs is still a matter of debate .",
    "it has been proposed that ulxs are powered by a stellar mass bhs ( 10@xmath420 @xmath5 ) accreting largely above the eddington limit and/or having beamed emission ( e.g. @xcite ) . alternatively , the compact object could simply be bigger , and the accretion would be in the usual sub - eddington regime . in this case",
    "the compact object would be an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) with a mass in excess of @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another interpretation follows from the possibility of forming massive stellar remnant bhs ( @xmath7 @xmath5 ) from the direct collapse of low - metallicity , massive ( @xmath8 ) stars ( @xcite )",
    ". some ulxs may contain such massive stellar remnant bhs accreting at or slightly above the eddington rate , formed in low metallicity environments ( @xmath9 ; e.g.@xcite ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath10 absorption depth at the threshold energy .",
    "+ @xmath11 for the solar abundance we assume @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we analyzed the epic - pn and rgs data of all the _ xmm - newton _ observations of x-1 and x-2 in an attempt to use them for determining the chemical abundances in the local source environment .",
    "following @xcite , for the epic - pn 5000 and 40000 counts are necessary to observe the oxygen k - shell and iron l - shell absorption edges at 0.538 kev and 0.851 kev , respectively .",
    "observation @xmath14 has @xmath15 58000 ( 53000 ) epic - pn counts for x-1 ( x-2 ) , and hence we can perform a chemical abundance analysis on the epic - pn spectrum similar to that presented in @xcite . in",
    "the spectral fits the _ tbabs _ absorption model is replaced with _",
    "tbvarabs _ that allows to vary the chemical abundances ( and grain composition ) .",
    "we set alternatively the abundance of oxygen or iron to zero .",
    "the spectrum was then fitted with the epic continuum model in table  [ ccd1 ] ( keeping all parameters , but normalizations , fixed ) plus an absorption edge , that accounts for the observed absorption feature .",
    "the parameters of the edge are then used to compute the abundance .    using this approach",
    ", we found that the o and fe abundances inferred from the epic - pn spectrum of x-1 are consistent with a sub - solar metallicity environment ( @xmath16 from the o edge ; table  [ ccd5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17 of the fit with the absorption edge is 1488 for 1423 dof , while that without the edge is 1759 for 1424 dof .",
    "for x-2 we find a subsolar abundance for oxygen ( @xmath18 ; see again table  [ ccd5 ] ) and an iron abundance consistent with zero",
    ". the fits returns @xmath19 ( 857 dof ) with the o edge and @xmath20 ( 858 dof ) without it .",
    "we tried to analyze also the rgs data of x-1 and x-2 using the same technique .",
    "as the sources are faint , the rgs net count rate is quite low ( @xmath21 count s@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , only the last observation ( observation @xmath14 , 122 ks ) reached a reasonable counting statistics in the rgs for the brightest ulx ( x-1 ) , while no useful analysis could be performed on x-2 .",
    "we tentatively identified two features in absorption in the rgs spectrum of x-1 , associated to o i ( 0.535 kev ) and fe i ( 0.709 kev ) .",
    "there may be also two other lines in emission at the characteristic energy of o viii k@xmath22 ( 0.653 kev ) and si k@xmath22 ( 1.748 kev ) , but their significance is very low .",
    "from the oxygen edge we found an abundance below solar ( @xmath16 ) for the absorbing material towards x-1 ( see table  [ ccd5 ] ) , although the statistical improvement obtained including the absorption edge is small .",
    "we tried to improve the analysis stacking together the rgs spectra in such a way to increase the counting statistics .",
    "we used only the rgs1 spectra , because our best diagnostic is the oxygen k - shell photoionization edge at 0.538 kev and the response of the rgs2 has some problems precisely in this energy range ( 0.5 - 0.6 kev ) .",
    "the stacked spectra of x-2 have not enough counting statistics for a meaningful analysis . for x-1 , we combined spectra together using the _ rgscombine _ command , that appropriately accounts for the response matrices and backgrounds of the different observations .",
    "we had to exclude several observations ( @xmath23 ) that caused technical problems in the processing with xspec .",
    "observation @xmath24 was also excluded for the reason explained in the previous section .",
    "the final combined rgs spectrum of x-1 has a total exposure time of 168 ks and @xmath25 net counts .",
    "we fitted it with a _",
    "diskbb+comptt _ model with parameters fixed and equal to the mean values obtained from the epic spectral fits of x-1 , setting the oxygen abundance to zero and adding an absorption edge ( figure  [ figtd2 ] ) .",
    "we found that the oxygen abundance is again subsolar ( table  [ ccd5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17 of the fit with the absorption edge is 139 for 103 dof , while that without the edge is 146 for 104 dof .",
    "however , the actual abundance is rather sensitive to the temperature of the soft component and its uncertainty becomes large if @xmath26 is included in the spectral fit .",
    "the analysis of all the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations shows that the spectra of x-1 and x-2 can be well reproduced by a comptonization model plus a soft disc component in which the coronae are always optically thick .",
    "both sources appear to show a well defined behaviour in the optical depth ( @xmath27 ) versus corona temperature ( @xmath28 ) plane .",
    "for x-2 we clearly identified two states that characterize the spectral variability and appear to have also different short term variability properties : a  very - thick \" ( more variable ) corona state in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 1.5 kev , and a `` thick - corona '' state in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 kev .",
    "we note that a morphological classification in terms of a harder brighter state and a softer dimmer state , based on a single power - law fit , has already been proposed for x-2 @xcite . here",
    "we offer a physical explanation of these two states in terms of varying parameters of an optically thick corona .",
    "the behaviour of x-1 may be interpreted within the same framework but , with presently available data , the observed changes in the coronal optical depth could be explained also in a different way ( e.g. as due to different variability patterns or accretion geometries ; @xcite ) .    for x-2 , which is on average less luminous than x-1",
    ", the two spectral states of the corona appear to correlate with luminosity .",
    "the optical depth of the corona increases as the total luminosity goes up , as expected if the corona responds rapidly to an increment in the instantaneous accretion rate .",
    "the behaviour of the disc component is also different in the two sources . while in x-1",
    "the luminosity and temperature of this component do not correlate , for x-2 we find that @xmath33 .",
    "however , as already mentioned , this result is uncertain as the two spectra that substantiate the correlation admit both a strong / warm and a weak / cool disc fit with close values of the @xmath17 .    a spectral analysis based on the assumption that the seed photon temperature ( @xmath34 ) is equal to the disc temperature ( @xmath35 ) has some inconsistencies because , if the corona is optically thick , the innermost part of the accretion disc is actually not visible and , hence , it is not necessarily true that @xmath36 . for this reason",
    ", we repeated our analysis with the _ _ diskbb__+_comptt _ model tying the two temperatures with a proportionality constant , that was fixed assuming a compact corona energetically coupled to the disc",
    "( disconnecting the two temperatures leads to difficulties in finding a global minimum because of the low counting statistics of several observations ) .",
    "we find changes in the corona parameters of @xmath37% , with typical variations of @xmath38% .",
    "however , the dependence of spectral states on the total luminosity that characterizes the behaviour of x-2 for equal temperatures is lost .",
    "while for x-1 the temperature of the disc continues not to correlate with the luminosity , for x-2 the correlation persists up to values of @xmath39 , consistent with strong disc - corona coupling ( @xmath40% ) .",
    "we emphasize that the model adopted in the present investigation is not entirely physically consistent .",
    "besides the issues of the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 that we tried to address as described above , there may be other caveats , such as the input photons not being a mono - temperature wien distribution ( as assumed in _ comptt _ ) , or the disc structure being different from a standard one at high accretion rates , or the origin and precise location of the thick corona / wind being unkown . however , our purpose was not to adopt the most physically consistent spectral model for ulxs , which does not exists yet , but a simplified one that can reflect the underlying physics and can be tested on the basis of the observed spectral variability patterns , limited by the current data quality .",
    "a full explanation of the observed spectral variability patterns of x-1 and x-2 is beyond the scope of the present investigation and appears not easy .",
    "here we simply propose some interpretations within the framework of recent work on the subject ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x-1 shows higher average isotropic luminosity ( @xmath41 erg s@xmath2 ) and smaller variability .",
    "the different spectral shapes do not correlate with luminosity , and the temperature and luminosity of the soft component do not vary together .",
    "these findings are consistent with x-1 being in the ultraluminous regime @xcite , accreting at super - eddington rates and launching powerful winds from a disc embedded in an optically thick corona .",
    "the accretion disc may be there , but in a different physical regime and covered by a wind / corona , while the soft component may actually represent emission from the wind itself .",
    "the larger x - ray fractional variability observed when the wind / corona is optically thicker may be consistent with increasing obscuration of the source caused by the turbolent wind itself at higher accretion rates ( @xcitea , b ) .",
    "as far as x-2 is concerned , it behaves in a way similar to x-1 on the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane and also the fractional x - ray variability of the two sources appears to be comparable .",
    "hence the corona may be in a similar physical state .",
    "again , this may be consistent with the picture in which we are seeing the two sources under a high inclination angle and the temporal variability may be produced by blobs in the wind that intersect our line of sight to the hottest central regions of the source ( @xcitea , b ) .",
    "however , as noted above , x-2 has a lower average luminosity and , for @xmath42 , it shows a weak correlation between the luminosity and inner temperature of the disc component .",
    "this may be interpreted as x-2 being in a less extreme regime , in which the average accretion rate is at around or slightly above the eddington limit .",
    "the soft spectral component may then physically represent a true accretion disc which is partly visible and has a characteristic temperature in the range 0.2 - 0.6 kev .",
    "clearly , some time - dependent interaction between the disc and the corona is likely to occur ( e. g. a slight expansion on a dynamical timescale of the corona as the accretion rate increases ) and may be responsible for the observed slope of the temperature - luminosity relation ( @xmath43 ) , which is different from that of a standard disc with fixed inner radius ( @xmath44 ) . clearly , as the corona is always optically thick , it is not possible to use the disc parameters for estimating the bh mass .",
    "we note that the disc temperature - luminosity correlation in x-2 disappears using a simple power - law to describe the spectrum of the corona , as found by @xcite ( and by @xcite for ic 342 x-1 ) , probably because the power - law does not take into account the spectral curvature at high energies .",
    "the correlation of the optical depth to the corona with luminosity that we found for x-2 ( assuming @xmath36 ) is in agreement with the results obtained for ho ix x-1 by @xcite .",
    "also ic 342 x-1 shows some hint of an increase in the coronal depth as the x - ray luminosity increases ( @xcite ) .",
    "these similarities in spectral variability patterns appear to be consistent with the proximity of these three ulxs in the spectral sequence proposed by @xcite .",
    "we used the rgs high spectral resolution to attempt an estimate of the metallicities of the local environments of x-1 and x-2 .",
    "because of the low signal - to - noise ratio , only the last , longest observation of x-1 could be used .",
    "the analysis was performed also on the epic spectrum .",
    "the metallicity in the x-1 environment is consistent with being below solar .",
    "the last epic spectrum of x-2 was also analyzed with the same method and suggests subsolar metallicity . in an attempt to increase the significance of our results we also stacked together the rgs spectra of some observations of x-1 and performed measurements of the metallicity on the stacked spectrum .",
    "also in this case the oxygen abundance turns out to be below solar , although it is rather sensitive to the temperature of the soft component .",
    "our estimates are in agreement with the abundance measurements from hii regions in ngc 1313 that give values that are all subsolar ( @xcite ) , but are smaller than the slightly supersolar metallicity of the x-1 enviroment found by @xcite .",
    "the difference with the latter authors may be due to the fact that we analyzed an observation with higher counting statistics and adopted a different spectral model .",
    "a couple of ulxs show periodic intensity variations in x - rays which are considered as signatures of the orbital period ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray spectra seem to change regularly with orbital phase .",
    "it is possible that these phase related variations may affect any result obtained from snapshot observations such as those presented here .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , the observed spectral variability patterns of x-1 and x-2 are rather complex and their interpretation does not appear directly comparable to that of galactic xrbs .",
    "for these reasons , the acquisition of new , high quality spectra through a dedicated x - ray monitoring programme is definitely needed .",
    "we would like to thank richard mushotzky for suggesting the stacking of rgs spectra , chris done , tim roberts and jeanette gladstone for helpful remarks on the adopted spectral models , and emanuele ripamonti for his suggestions on the metallicity estimates .",
    "we thank also the two referees of this paper for useful comments .",
