    "in normal diffusion processes , the diffusivity can be characterized by the diffusion coefficient in the mean square displacement ( msd ) .",
    "however , many diffusion processes in nature show anomalous diffusion ; that is , the msd does not grow linearly with time but follows a sublinear or superlinear growth with time , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a position in one - dimensional coordinate , @xmath2 is time , and @xmath3 means an ensemble average . in particular , anomalous diffusion in biological systems has been found by single - particle tracking experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , the power - law exponent @xmath4 is one of the most important quantities characterizing the underlying diffusion process .",
    "especially , anomalous diffusion with @xmath5 is called subdiffusion and that with @xmath6 is called superdiffusion .",
    "although anomalous diffusion can be characterized by the power - law exponent @xmath4 in the msd , the exponent can not reveal the underlying physical nature in itself .",
    "this is because the same power - law exponent in the msd does not imply that the physical mechanism in the anomalous diffusion is also the same .",
    "therefore , clarifying the origin of anomalous diffusion is an important subject , and many researches on this issue have been conducted extensively @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties characterizing anomalous diffusion is ergodicity , i.e. , time - averaged observables being equal to a constant ( the ensemble average ) . in some experiments",
    "@xcite , ( generalized ) diffusion coefficients for time - averaged msds show large fluctuations , suggesting that ergodicity breaks .    in stochastic models of anomalous diffusion , continuous - time random",
    "walk ( ctrw ) shows a prominent feature called _ distributional ergodicity _",
    "@xcite ; that is , the time - averaged observables obtained from single trajectories do not converge to a constant but the distribution of such time - averaged observables converges to a universal distribution ( _ convergence in distribution _ ) .",
    "more precisely , the distribution of the time - averaged msd ( tamsd ) , which is defined by @xmath7 converges to the mittag - leffler distribution of order @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this statement can be represented by @xmath9 for a fixed @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is a random variable with the mittag - leffler distribution of order @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the diffusion coefficients in the tamsds are also distributed according to the mittag - leffler distribution because the tamsd shows normal diffusion , i.e , @xmath13 @xcite , where we refer to @xmath14 as the diffusion coefficient . in stochastic models ,",
    "such distributional behavior originates from the divergent mean trapping time . in diffusion in a random energy landscape such as a trap model @xcite , the trapping - time distribution follows a power law , @xmath15 , if heights of the energy barrier are distributed according to the exponential distribution .",
    "the exponent @xmath8 smaller than 1 implies a divergence of the mean . in dynamical systems",
    ", this divergent mean brings an infinite measure @xcite .",
    "thus , such distributional behavior of time - averaged observables is also shown in _ infinite ergodic theory _ @xcite . moreover ,",
    "large fluctuations of time - averaged observables , related to distributional ergodicity , have been observed in biological experiments @xcite as well as quantum dot experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that the distribution of the diffusion coefficients of the tamsds in the stored - energy - driven lvy flight ( sedlf ) is different from that in ctrw @xcite .",
    "the sedlf is a ctrw with jump lengths correlated with trapping times @xcite .",
    "one of the most typical examples for such a correlated motion can be observed in lvy walk @xcite .",
    "however , lvy walk and sedlf are completely different stochastic processes in that a random walker can not move while it is traped in sedlf , whereas it can move with constant velocity in lvy walk . in other words , in sedlf , a random walker does not move while storing a sort of energy , and it jumps using the stored energy ( see fig .  1 ) . when the trapping - time distribution follows a power - law , the jump length distribution also follows a power - law , the same as in lvy flight .",
    "since we consider a power - law trapping - time distribution , we refer to our model as the stored - energy - driven lvy flight .",
    "we note that the msd does not diverge in sedlf , whereas it always diverges in lvy flight .",
    "although the ensemble - averaged msds show subdiffusion as well as superdiffusion , the tamsds always increase linearly with time in sedlf @xcite .",
    "this behavior is completely different from that in lvy walk @xcite .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the tamsd with a fixed @xmath10 converge to a time - independent distribution which is not the same as a universal distribution in ctrw ( mittag - leffler distribution ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a random variable and @xmath18 is the coupling parameter between trapping time and jump length .",
    "we note that such coupling effects become physically important in turbulent diffusion @xcite , diffusion of cold atoms @xcite , and nonthermal systems such as cells @xcite",
    ". in such enhanced diffusions , it has been known that the coupling between jump lengths and waiting times follows a power - law fashion like sedlf @xcite , although a particle is always moving , which is different from sedlf .",
    "furthermore , it will also be important in complex systems such as finance @xcite and earthquakes @xcite because jump lengths are correlated with the waiting times in such systems .    in terms of an ensemble average ,",
    "sedlf exhibits a whole spectrum of diffusion : sub- , normal- , and super - diffusion , depending on the coupling parameter @xcite . because distributional behavior of the time - averaged observables such as the diffusion coefficients in sedlf is different from that in ctrw",
    ", it is important to construct a phase diagram in terms of the power - law exponent of the msd as well as the form of the distribution function of the tamsd .",
    "here , we provide the phase diagram for the whole parameters range in sedlf .",
    "sedlf is a cumulative process , which is a generalization of a renewal process @xcite .",
    "equivalently , sedlf is a ctrw with a non - separable joint probability of trapping time and jump length .",
    "therefore , the sedlf can be defined through the joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the probability that a random walker jumps with length @xmath21 just after it is trapped for period @xmath22 since its previous jump @xcite . here , we consider the following joint pdf @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pdf of trapping times and @xmath25 is a coupling strength .",
    "this kind of coupling has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the sedlf with @xmath26 is just a separable ctrw .",
    "in addition , we consider that the pdf of trapping times follows a power law : @xmath27 as @xmath28 . here , @xmath29 is the stable index , a constant @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 with a scale factor @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the mean trapping time diverges for @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the pdf of jump length also follows a power law : @xmath35 thus , the second moment of the jump length diverges for @xmath36 .",
    "because lvy flight also has a power law distribution of jump length , we call this random walk the stored - energy - driven lvy flight . in numerical simulations , we set the pdf of the trapping time as @xmath37 @xmath38 .",

    "( [ e.pdf-jump-length ] ) , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "because the mean trapping time is finite for @xmath42 , we consider two typical renewal processes ; ordinary renewal process and equilibrium renewal process @xcite .",
    "equilibrium renewal process is assumed to start @xmath43 ( see fig .  [ traj_eq ] ) .",

    "thus , the joint pdf of the first jump length and the first apparent trapping time , @xmath49 , is not given by the form in eq .",
    "( [ e.joint-prob ] ) .",
    "this is because the first jump length @xmath44 is determined by the time elapsed since a random walker s last jump ( the first true trapping time ) and thus it is not directly related to the first apparent trapping time , i.e. , the time elapsed since the beginning of the measurement at @xmath50 . for ordinary renewal process",
