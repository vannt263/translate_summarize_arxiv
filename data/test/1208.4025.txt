    "the wavelength greatly exceeds the length scale of the individual objects under investigation , e.g. , bio - molecules or nanostructures .",
    "therefore , spectroscopy of single objects is challenging and measurements are usually performed in large ensembles at high concentrations . when working with a limited amount of material or individual objects , the response may drop below the detection threshold . in order to compensate for these constraints , local field enhancements into subwavelength volumes are needed .",

    "the conically tapered waveguide enhances the transmitted field with respect to the cylindrical waveguide . while the cylindrical waveguide only transmits the fraction of the field incident onto the opening and reflects the rest , the conically tapered waveguide guides the incident field at the larger input aperture towards the smaller output aperture .",

    "for frequencies below cutoff there is an enhancement of the field inside the waveguide , but the transmission is reduced because the propagating field is fully reflected before the aperture is reached .",
    "the interference pattern in the intensity enhancement is the result of the interference of the incident field and this reflection .",
    "for waves having frequencies close to the cutoff frequency , there is a transition from the evanescent transmitted field to propagating waves .",

    "both waveguides are measured in transmission and compared against each other and a reference measurement taken without waveguide , i.e. , the response function of the setup .",
    "the time domain signals ( figure  [ fig06](a ) ) show that the presence of the cylindrical waveguide severely reduces the transmitted signal , since most of the incident amplitude is blocked by the waveguide .",
    "the enhanced transmission of the conically tapered waveguide , relative to the cylindrical waveguide , is visible as an increase in the thz pulse dispersion .",
    "this is the contribution of the field that illuminated the entrance of the waveguide at a larger radius , and has picked up an additional phase before reaching the output aperture .",
    "the transmittance spectra for the conically tapered ( red - solid curve ) and cylindrical ( green - dashed curve ) waveguides in figure [ fig06](b ) are obtained by fourier transforming the time domain signals to obtain the power spectrum , and are normalized against the setup response , i.e. , the power spectrum measured without any waveguide . for both waveguides",
    "the transmittance vanishes at the lowest frequencies due to cutoff .",
    "the transmittance remains below 0.05 for the cylindrical waveguide even at higher frequencies .",
    "this reduced transmittance is due to the large area of the incident beam that is blocked . in our setup ,",

    "this ratio of 1/25 matches the experimental results .",

    "most of the characteristics from the simulations shown in figure [ fig04 ] are reproduced by the measurements .",
    "the transmittance approaches 0.3 at , while the output aperture only encloses around 5 % of the area of the incident pulse .",
    "the reduced transmittance around is also consistent with the simulations , and can be explained by the aforementioned destructive interference in the wavefront . the blue shift of this minimum in the measurements , compared to the simulations , can be attributed to the approximation of plane wave illumination used for the simulations . in the simulations ,",
    "the complete input aperture is illuminated by a plane wave , whereas in the experiments the pulse has a gaussian profile and it is slightly smaller than the input aperture of the waveguide .",
    "this smaller size of the beam reduces the effective height of the waveguide and introduces a blue - shift of the interference features .",

    "the measured extinction , which is defined as 1 minus the transmittance , of this single antenna in front of the waveguide is shown in figure  [ fig07](a ) with the solid - red curve . the transmission measurements through the single antenna are referenced to the transmission of the waveguide with an empty quartz substrate at the output entrance , i.e. , without the antenna .",
    "a resonance is clearly resolved in this measurement with a maximum extinction of 90 % around .",
    "this enhanced extinction corresponds to the excitation of a lspr in the plasmonic antenna , which should lead to a large local field enhancement in the bowtie gap .",
    "the blue - dashed curve in figure [ fig07](a ) corresponds to the extinction of the single antenna measured without the waveguide .",
    "the response is practically flat and the lspr can not be resolved .    to rule out any possible artifact in the measurements that could lead to an extinction peak similar to our measurements ,",
    "we have confirmed the resonant response of the bowtie antenna by measuring the extinction of a random array of similar antennas without the conically tapered waveguide .",
    "an optical microscope image of the sample is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig07](b ) . in this measurement ,",
    "the thz beam illuminates approximately 30 antennas .",

    "the extinction reaches a maximum at 0.4 thz , with a resonant response that can be attributed to the excitation of lsprs .",

    "for example , the positioning of a nanostructure in the subwavelength gap defined by the two monomers , in which the field is locally enhanced , will enable to increase the thz field - matter interaction to a level at which far - field spectroscopy of single nanostructures at thz frequencies might be possible .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated that a conically tapered waveguide can be used to funnel and enhance the thz intensity .",
    "this intensity enhancement allows us to measure the extinction of a single thz plasmonic bowtie antenna , which otherwise can not be detected due to the large background of unscattered radiation .",
    "the transmittance properties are also investigated numerically finding an excellent agreement with the measurements .",
