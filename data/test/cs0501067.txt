    "emerging wireless systems , such as wideband code division multiple access ( wcdma ) and impulse radio , operate at wide bandwidths .",
    "these systems can achieve higher data rates , are more immune to the deleterious effects of multipath fading , and require low power consumption .",
    "many other wireless communication systems such as satellite , deep space , and sensor networks , also operate in the low - power regime where both spectral efficiency ( rate in bits per second divided by bandwidth in hertz ) and energy - per - bit are low . for these systems ,",
    "information theoretic results on the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy tradeoff , which reflects the fundamental tradeoff between bandwidth and power , provide insightful results leading to the more efficient use of resources in the low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) regime .",
    "verd @xcite has recently analyzed the spectral efficiency of a general class of average power limited channels characterizing the optimal bandwidth - power tradeoff in the wideband regime .",
    "in particular , it is shown in @xcite that when the receiver has imperfect fading side information , input signals with increasingly higher peak power is required to achieve the capacity as @xmath1 . on the other hand , limiting the peakedness of the input signals , when neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the fading , is known to have a significant impact on the achievable spectral efficiency in the low - power regime @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper , we continue our study of noncoherent rician fading channels begun in part i @xcite and consider the minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication when the input signals have limited peakiness .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : prelim ] , we review the basic measures of interest in the low - power regime proposed in @xcite . in section [ sec : specteff ] , we analyze the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy tradeoff in the noncoherent rician fading channel when , in addition to the average power limitation , the input is subject to a fourth moment or a peak power constraint . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : effsignal ] , we show efficient signaling schemes in the low - power regime , while section [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in the low - power regime , the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy tradeoff is the key concept capturing the tradeoff between bandwidth and power .",
    "we will denote the spectral efficiency as a function of bit energy by @xmath2 . if we assume without loss of generality that one complex symbol occupies a @xmath3 time - frequency slot , then the maximum achievable spectral efficiency can be obtained from the shannon capacity ( bits / symbol ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bit energy normalized to the noise power .",
    "however , the shannon capacity , giving the full characterization of the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy function , is either not known or must be numerically computed for most fading channels whose realizations are not fully known at the receiver . hence one needs to resort to approximation methods to examine the spectral efficiency of a wide class of fading channels . in the low - regime ,",
    "first - order linear approximation of the spectral efficiency function provides an excellent match , and involves only the slope of the spectral efficiency curve and the bit - energy at zero spectral efficiency .",
    "the bit - energy at zero spectral efficiency which depends only on the first derivative of the capacity at zero , i.e. , @xmath6 is a relevant measure only in the asymptotic regime of infinite bandwidth .",
    "verd @xcite has recently given the following formula for the wideband slope defined as the slope of the spectral efficiency curve @xmath2 in bits / s / hz/3db at zero spectral efficiency : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the first and second derivatives of capacity at zero in nats .",
    "the wideband slope closely approximates the growth of the spectral efficiency curve in the low - power regime and hence is proposed as a new tool providing insightful results when bandwidth is a resource to be conserved .",
    "for average power limited channels , the bit energy required for reliable communications decreases monotonically with decreasing spectral efficiency , and the minimum bit energy is achieved at zero spectral efficiency , @xmath10 .",
    "hence for fixed rate transmission , reduction in the required power comes only at the expense of increased bandwidth . by assuming an ergodic fading process of finite second moment , lapidoth and shamai @xcite",
    "have shown that the minimum received bit energy for an average power limited discrete - time single - input single - output fading channel with gaussian noise is @xmath11 db .",
    "recently , verd @xcite has independently proven that the minimum received bit energy of @xmath11 db is achieved in a general class of average power limited multiple - input multiple - output fading channels as long as the additive background noise is gaussian .",
    "this result holds regardless of the availability of the fading knowledge at the receiver and transmitter . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that having imperfect receiver side information has a tremendous effect on the wideband slope .",
    "although there is a positive slope when there is perfect receiver channel side information , imperfect fading knowledge at the receiver results in zero wideband slope , and in this case flash signaling is required to achieve the capacity in the low - power regime .",
    "hence , achieving the minimum bit energy becomes very demanding in terms of both bandwidth and the peak - to - average ratio of the transmitted signal .",
    "in this section , we consider the noncoherent rician fading channel model @xmath12 studied in part i of this paper @xcite and investigate the spectral - efficiency versus energy - per - information bit tradeoff in the low - power regime when the peakedness of the input signals is limited by a fourth moment or a peak power constraint .",
    "moreover , at the end of this section , we comment on the spectral efficiency in the low - regime of the average power limited rician channel with phase noise .",
    "we first consider the case in which the input is subject to the following second and fourth moment amplitude constraints : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the first - order linear approximation of the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy function in the low - power regime is determined by the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero . under quite general conditions on the input and the channel , prelov and",

    ", we can obtain the first and second derivatives of the mutual information at zero for the noncoherent rician fading channel ( [ eq : model ] ) with second and fourth moment input constraints .",

    "_ proof _ : for the noncoherent rician fading channel model , we have established in @xcite that the capacity - achieving input distribution has finite support .",
    "hence , the optimal input distribution satisfies the condition ( [ eq : condontheinput ] ) .",
    "therefore , the proposition follows easily by specializing the general result ( [ eq : prelovverdu ] ) of prelov and verd to the rician channel model ( [ eq : model ] ) , i.e. , @xmath30 since , by our assumption , @xmath31 , the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : secondorderasymp ] ) is maximized by having @xmath32 .",
    "note that since the other terms characterize the second- and higher - order behavior , the average power constraint should be satisfied with equality to achieve the first derivative of the capacity at zero .",
    "notice also that the second term is maximized by having @xmath33 , and hence the asymptotic capacity expression becomes @xmath34 from which the result follows .",
    "_ it can be easily seen from the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : secondorderasymp ] ) that for the rayleigh channel ( @xmath36 ) with input constraints ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) , @xmath37 .",

    "hence , for fixed @xmath39 , capacity curves under fourth moment constraints with different but finite @xmath40 values have the same slope at zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the second derivative depends on both @xmath38 and @xmath40 and is positive if @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rician factor .",

    "the following bounds on the minimum received bit energy are easily obtained : @xmath76 where the lower bound is the minimum received bit energy when there is only an average power constraint , and the upper bound is the received bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency when the input is subject to a fourth moment constraint .",
