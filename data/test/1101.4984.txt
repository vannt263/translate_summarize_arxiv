    "living systems as far - from - equilibrium open systems , are essentially cognitive , and conversely , in order to grasp the essence of cognition , one may attempt to understand the ontology of the former processes . often this is viewed in the framework of a cell - like , structured , self - organizing system engaged in a two - way interaction between its functional mechanisms and that of its neighboring environment .",
    "there are several theories that revolve around this principle .",
    "readers may be familiar with a central relationship as explained by autopoiesis , a seemingly enduring theory as developed by maturana and varela ( 1980a , 1980b ) over several decades .",
    "though a much earlier and somewhat different hypothesis of bertalanffy ( 1972 ) had proposed that living systems are maintained in non - equilibrium states by a flow - like patterns when drawing matter and energy from their environment , and adjust accordingly in a `` flowing balance '' ( bertalanffy , 1972 ; capra , 1996 ) . further scientific rigor aimed at understanding this hypothesis was achieved by prigogine ( 1980 ) who formulated similar ideas cast within a theory of dissipative structures . whereas living systems are continuously maintained in - far - from equilibrium , dissipative structures do likewise while being capable of evolving .",
    "they are destabilized in the increase of information and energy , though as they remain self - organized and self - perpetuating , the complexity of their structure increases ; often this is simply for the sake of survival within the environment . elucidating a possible synthesis of these separate approaches , commencing from the bertalanffy hypothesis , is the main topic of capra ( 1996 ) .",
    "but cognition is also a function of a prevailing culture : by means of social and historical patterns of behavior traditions , etc .",
    ", human cognition feeds back into that culture through the course of social interaction , adaptive technologies , policies , memetic trends , etc . , and inevitably alters it in time ( see e.g. clark , 1997 ; hollan et al . , 2000 ; hutchins , 1994 ; richerson and boyd , 2004 ; wallace and fullilove , 2008 ) .",
    "there are several common factors at stake here , and in seeking to understand these , the ` immunology ",
    "language ' viewpoint of atlan and cohen ( 1998 ) ( see also cohen , 2000 ) views human organizations at all levels as perceiving patterns of threat or opportunity , comparing those patterns with some internal , learned or inherited , picture of the world , and then choosing one or a small number of responses from a vastly larger repertory of that which is possible to them .",
    "putting it another way , consider a basic observation concerning the immune system : the latter incorporates its own system of options and responds cognitively at the level of information processing such that the _ meaning _ of an antigen is defined by the response of the immune system , somewhat reminiscent of earlier work of jerne ( 1974 ) who had postulated such ` meaning ' .",
    "the broader cognitive model that results from this can said to be a ` reactive ' system determined by contextual factors in cohen and harel ( 2007 ) as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "starting from this basic perspective , wallace ( 2005 ) has formulated a model of cognition that takes ` meaning ' in the sense of dretske s theory of semantic communication ( dretske , 1981 , 1988 ) claiming that the immune perception / response information networks of any cognitive system must be constrained by shannon s fundamental limit theorems of information theory ( see e.g. ash , 1990 ; berger , 1971 ; cover and thomas , 1991 ) . these networks comprising of cognitive modules",
    "interact within the framework of a kind of broadcasting system relaying within ` a theater of consciousness '  the basic operative hypothesis of the _ global ( neuronal ) workspace _ theory as developed in ( baars , 1988 ; baars and franklin , 2003 ) that forms an integral part of the model in ( wallace , 2005 ; wallace and fullilove , 2008 ) .    here",
    "we take a further step forward that incorporates a number of related factors mainly following the ( generalized ) onsager relations of non - equilibrium thermodynamics combined with the principles of _ rate distortion _ theory which is one of the mainstays of shannon s pioneering work .",
    "one particular observation is that distortion in communication between interacting cognitive modules , is patently stochastic , in particular , it is manifestly a process of brownian motion .",
    "this observation is developed in several steps relative to a corresponding stochastic differential equation that eventually unfolds to a kind of master equation . by considering critical solutions for the distortion , we argue on a case - by - case basis that the ensuing brownian motion ( viz weiner process ) can be locally one of bounded variation .",
    "accordingly , we are motivated to introduce the necessary conditions that permit integration of these equations in order to obtain _ a multidimensional it process _ ; further we discuss those formal conditions that describe an associated stochastic solution flow . thus in a way we have recovered bertalanffy s perception of the `` flow '' of living systems , the kind of which information - tied epigenetic systems are certain representations .    whereas such model conditions are mathematically stated for a flow in a smooth manifold geometry",
    ", we do not claim such ` smoothness ' in general .",
    "indeed , such epigenetic ` flow systems ' in living organisms and brain - environment interactions may be at best continuous over time and are most likely to be ` singular ' in some sense .",
    "the latter requires harder topological techniques and possible complications that detract from a more natural interpretation .",
    "eventually one seeks a workable common ground between various mathematical abstractions and the actual empirical properties of the systems themselves .",
    "another slant emerging from this cognitive paradigm goes towards epigenetic information sources as providing a _ tunable catalyst _ directed to gene expression by which the embedding of information sources can direct developmental pathways within the ontology of enveloped structures via the process of information ( wallace and wallace , 2008 ) .",
    "this leads to further developments of several cognitive paradigms for gene expression , in part furthering the scientific reason underlying that of jablonka and lamb ( 2005 ) who consider epigenetic inheritance systems in which information may be transmitted through generations , not just simply through the base sequence of dna , but also transmitted via cultural and behavioral means in higher animals , and by epigenetic means in cell lineages .",
    "this is initiated by memory systems that enable somatic cells of differing phenotype , but of identical genotype , to transmit their phenotypes to their descendants , even in the absence of the original stimuli that had engaged these phenotypes .",
    "conditional upon an individual s phenotype , environmental factors may trigger alterations in behavior and health , eventually impinging upon the nervous system with the likely consequence of mental disarray . in this respect moffitt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( cf caspi and moffitt , 2006 ) make several observations : ( 1 ) a heritable versus environmental influence on phenotype variation across a given environment , ( 2 ) altered gene expressions via epigenetic programming geared in response to subsequent health - behavioral reactions towards the environment , ( 3 ) how an individual s phenotype determines a risk - level towards the environment , and ( 4 ) behavioral effects due to interdependence between specified variations in the dna sequence specific to a measured environment .",
    "indispensable to understanding and extending these findings is the parallel question of how gene - cultural interaction , two distinct but interacting hereditary systems , compares psychopathology across oriental and western cultures in basic perceptual processes , often an important piece missing from the larger picture ( nisbett , 2003 ; richerson and boyd , 2004 ; wallace , 2005 ; wallace , 2009 ) . as such distinct interacting systems of information influencing action and behavior , both kinds ( genes and culture ) are claimed in durham ( 1991 ) to create a real and unambiguous symmetry : between genes and phenotypes on the one hand , and culture and phenotypes on the other , whereby genes and culture may be reasonably viewed as two parallel lines of hereditary influence on phenotypes . from the perspective of ( wallace , 2005 ; wallace and wallace , 2008 ; wallace and wallace , 2009 )",
    "both can be realized as generalized languages in the sense they have their own intrinsic recognizable grammar and syntax ( see  [ meaningful ] ) .",
    "likewise , on reflecting upon the fundamental mechanisms of serial endosymbiotic theory ( see e.g. margulis , 2004 ) , witzany ( 2006 ) argues a case for extending the latter via biosemiotic cell - cell type interactions as ` signed ' language - communication processes subject to a range of syntactic , pragmatic and semantic rules as applied to protein coding dna , rna editing , dna splicing , transcription and other essential functions .          a more general perspective is to consider those central relations characterizing the system and its various structural components , and how a state is altered under perturbations by the environment .",
    "an autopoietic system is organizationally closed and structurally determined .",
    "the system s autopoiesis is preserved within the living state , adaptable only to structural fluctuations for as long as the living entity survives within and is structurally coupled to its environment ; otherwise there is termination .",
    "the autopoiesis of the nervous system ( though itself is not strictly autopoietic ) functionally self-(creates ) replicates in order to engage in cognition .",
    "though structurally dependent , the nervous system affords an innate plasticity and with appropriate alterations , it is conducive to learning and can adapt itself towards broader interactions and human self - consciousness ( maturana and varela , 1980a , 1980b ) .",
    "such broader interpretations of this theory are addressed in mingers ( 1991 ) , such as the family nexus which via its idiosyncratic behavioral and linguistic interactions ( in relationship to hereditary factors , socioeconomic status , environment , culture , etc . ) , creates a peculiar structured reality that for the best part is only accessible to the members themselves , and through which a prospective psychotherapist must explore in order to fathom out those recurrent patterns of conversation and behavior influencing the cognitive malfunctioning of any concerned ( cf laing and esterson , 1964 ) .",
    "there are related theories with varying degrees of overlap to the overall concepts of maturana and varela ( 1980a , 1980b ) .",
    "one example is a biogenetic - structuralist theory ( laughlin and daquili , 1974 ) where connections within an evolutionary context are made between neural organization / brain  functional activity and the environment .",
    "the result is `` acquired models of reality '' , again , a cognitive outcome of the response to and engagement with the environment , proposing a concept of ` neurognosis ' , a kind of ` holographic ' model based upon biogenetically induced rudimentary information embedded in various associated regions of the brain , as taken from birth towards the later stages of maturity .",
    "the neurognostic model depends upon ontogenetic feedback from an external reality according to which acquired components are continually engaged with sensory input .",
    "such modes are claimed to be represented in neural processes by probability expectations which we shall see , lie at the heart of information theory , and which encode the behavior of these process in relationship to the environment .",
    "thus it may be reasonable to suppose that enriched environments of some sort reciprocate to a greater advantage than others , and the structures governing the alignment of the self to the environment to an extent evolved in accordance to some degree of mastery over the latter .",
    "take for instance , the hypothalamic ",
    "pituitary  adrenal ( hpa ) axis ( as governing the neurophysiology of the `` flight or fight '' mechanism ) is cognitive in the sense of atlan and cohen ( 1998 ) . if there is an arousal of the individual s close environment , then mind , memory and emotional cognition engage , evaluate and select appropriate responses .",
    "the hpa accelerates this process and possible malfunctioning may induce hyper  reactivity as observed in cases of post  traumatic stress disorder .",
    "depression , as another example , may be partly viewed as the evolution of a structure conducive to a negative alignment of the self with an external reality .",
    "if we think of a child as gradually mastering its environment via a symbiotic relation with its mother , then take away the mother , the inability to further manage the environment activates a negative kind of ( neurognostic ) structure such as those that have been researched in the context of various evolutionary theories of depression that are founded upon the occurrence of attachment - defeat - loss , diminished opportunities , down - regulation of foraging capability , social / professional rank , etc .",
    "incurred with varying risk factors within a culturally influenced environment ( see e.g. gilbert , 2006 ; moffitt et al . , 2006 ; wallace , 2009 ) .",
    "another example is to consider the body s blood pressure control system consisting as a network of cognitive systems which compare a set of incoming signals with an internal reference structure in order to select a suitable level of blood pressure from possible levels ; hence as claimed in ( wallace and fullilove , 2008 ; wallace and wallace , 2009 ) an elaborate tumor control strategy must be at least as cognitive as the immune system itself .",
    "thus granted that most ( if not all ) given classes of cognitive modules interact within their cultural environment , we may proceed to consider what happens when the environment _ is _ the communication medium itself .",
    "for instance , in typical ai laboratory models where multi - agent , inter - sensing systems function in local coordinated tasks ( often with no explicit communication between agents ) , the eventual net effect may induce a ` shared memory ' ( cao et al .",
    ", 1997 ; krieger et al . , 2000 )",
    "where , for instance , it was claimed that more energetic and efficient foraging tasks were typical of multi - agent ( robotic ) systems compared to individual agents , and the former tended to produce behavioral patterns similar to those of ` ant  like ' decentralized control systems . on the other hand , biological regulatory networks besides being susceptible to alterations in the environment and/or intracellular conditions , may operate stochastically in varying degrees as seen along the pathways of neuronal signalling transduction ( manninen et al . , 2006 ) that provides an analogy motivating part of this paper ( see  [ ito - process ] ) .",
    "a similar scenario is that of neuronal ` trail systems ' ( ts ) in glade et al .",
    "( 2009 ) : single wire and logical gates in a self ",
    "organized bioprocessor along which self  propelled particles communicate via traces etched out in the environment , thus creating the ts . the claim of glade et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is that such systems , although not precisely defined , are capable of programming and function on the basis of a turing machine .",
    "it suggests an evolutionary factor by which various living beings , by activating their respective nervous systems , have trained themselves to use models like the ts towards evolution within and possible mastery over their environment , by means of simulating ` trail ' signals .",
    "more from an information - theory viewpoint , wallace ( 2009b ) envisages similar ideas to trail systems as reminiscent of ` roman roads ' : decision making and tasking within small local communities , eventually creating ` roads ' , manifestly inter  connected cognitive modules having different time constraints , but eventually creating extensions of ` local consciousness ' .",
    "a rate distortion argument applies here to account for the mutual crosstalk between different modules using the homology of the rate distortion function with free energy as will be described later .",
    "next we proceed with some specifics .",
    "as is well  known , distortion arises when there is a fast relay of information through some channel which exceeds the latter s capacity .",
    "one of the principles of the shannon theory is that in order to reproduce a message transmitted from a source to a receiver , it is necessary to know what sort of information should be transmitted and how . for the purpose of engineering a communication system , one needs to figure out a suitable encoding / decoding system once the nature of the channel is specified .",
    "following berger ( 1971 ) , we briefly recall some of the basic principles involved .    * source encoder *",
    ": we may consider some output @xmath0 emanating from the source as projected to a finite set of preselected images , namely , the space of possible source outputs is partitioned into a set of _ equivalence classes _ and the source encoder informs the channel encoder of that class containing the particular source output observed .",
    "once the channel encoder is informed that the source output belongs to say , the @xmath1-th equivalence class , it transforms the corresponding waveform @xmath2 across the channel .",
    "* source decoder * : within the system is a cascade of a channel encoder and a source decoder .",
    "the channel decoder receives a waveform @xmath3 of a corresponding function @xmath4 over some time interval and decides upon the nature of the message as transmitted .",
    "then it sends its approximation @xmath5 of the message number to the source decoder which in turn creates @xmath6 to register the system s estimate of @xmath0 over that time interval .",
    "initially , we may think of @xmath0 and @xmath4 as ` waveforms ' , but in our case , we consider these as consisting of a language with its own intrinsic grammar / syntax , as well as ` meaning '  to be made more specific in  [ meaningful ] .",
    "analogous considerations apply to the channel signals @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "one of shannon s notable results was that a communication system can be designed such that it achieves a level of fidelity @xmath8 once the _ rate distortion _",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the channel capacity .",
    "putting it another way , if the receiver can tolerate an average amount of distortion @xmath8 , the rate distortion @xmath11 is the effective rate at which the source can relay information with that level of tolerance .",
    "the rate at which a source produces information subject to insisting upon perfect reproduction , is the _ source entropy _ @xmath12 .",
    "given a distortion measure such that perfect reproduction is assigned zero distortion , then we have @xmath13 . as @xmath8 increases",
    ", @xmath11 becomes a monotonically decreasing ( convex ) function which eventually is zero , typically at a maximum value for @xmath8 ( see berger , 1971 , chapter 1 ) .",
    "this is a very basic observation , and typically in rate distortion theory one seeks a reduction of @xmath12 by either slowing down the emission of coding , or encoding the relevant languages at a lower rate . in view of shannon s theorem ,",
    "as long as @xmath14 , we will obtain appropriate fidelity in transmission .",
    "inherent difficulties are clear , since the source rate may be corrupted due to low memory and coding congestion , hence the need for a communicating system to evolve so as recover the source data at the channel output satisfying the shannon estimate .",
    "having mentioned the rate distortion function @xmath11 we now follow berger ( 1971 ) to give its specific definition in terms of _ average mutual information _",
    "( an alternative , and equivalent definition of @xmath11 and a statement of the rate distortion theorem will be given in appendix [ appendix - b ] ) .",
    "firstly , for @xmath15 running over a suitable alphabet , let us write a given conditional probability assignment as @xmath16 such that in the usual way we have an associated joint distribution @xmath17 .",
    "we express _ the average distortion _ as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the distortion measure .",
    "a conditional probability assignment @xmath20 is said to be _",
    "@xmath8admissible _ if and only if @xmath21 . the set of all @xmath8admissible conditional probability assignments we denote by @xmath22 along with an average distortion @xmath23 , we also have an _ average mutual information _ @xmath24.\\ ] ] then for fixed @xmath8 , the rate distortion function is defined as @xmath25 observe that if a parameter @xmath26 represents the slope of the function @xmath11 at a point @xmath27 generated parametrically , we have @xmath28 ( this is not exactly trivial : see berger , 1971 , theorem 2.5.1 ) .      more formally , a pattern of sensory input is mixed in an unspecified but systematic algorithmic manner with a pattern of internal ongoing activity to create a path of combined signals @xmath29 .",
    "each @xmath30 thus represents some functional composition of internal and external signals .",
    "wallace ( 2005 ) provides some neural network examples .",
    "this path is fed into a highly nonlinear , but otherwise similarly unspecified , decision oscillator , @xmath31 , which generates an output @xmath32 that is an element of one of two disjoint sets @xmath33 and @xmath34 of possible system responses .",
    "let @xmath35    assume a graded response , supposing that if @xmath36 the pattern is not recognized , and if @xmath37 the pattern is recognized , and some action @xmath38 takes place .",
    "such oscillators may be influenced by ` forcing ' when a signal is subjected to some impulse such that its frequency , and hence the response , adjusts accordingly with respect to that applied impulse .",
    "more familiar oscillating physical models react to this by exhibiting ` beats ' and ` resonance ' for instance .",
    "the principal objects of formal interest are paths @xmath39 which , through information flow , trigger pattern recognition - and - response .",
    "that is , given a fixed initial state @xmath40 , we examine all possible subsequent paths @xmath39 beginning with @xmath40 and leading to the event @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , but @xmath44 .    for each positive integer @xmath45 ,",
    "let @xmath46 be the number of high probability grammatical / syntactical paths of length @xmath45 which begin with some particular @xmath40 and further leading to the condition @xmath47 .",
    "these are paths of combined signals as above , that are structured to some language . for short ,",
    "we call such paths ` meaningful ' , assuming , not unreasonably , that @xmath46 will be considerably less than the number of all possible paths of length @xmath45 leading from @xmath40 to the condition @xmath41 .    one critical assumption which permits an inference on the necessary conditions constrained by the asymptotic limit theorems of information theory , is that the finite limit @xmath48}{n},\\ ] ] ( the ` uncertainty ' ) both exists and is independent of the path @xmath39 .",
    "the rate distortion principle applies as follows ( wallace , 2005 ) : _ the restriction to meaningful sequences of symbols increases the rate at which information can be transmitted with arbitrary small error , and that the grammar / syntax of the path can be associated with a dual information source_. here we may assume a typical information source @xmath49 to be ` adiabatic ' , ` piece - wise stationary ' and ` ergodic ' ( apse ) , and that a system engaging in a cognitive process is describable as such .",
    "we list here the explanations :    * ` adiabatic ' means that the changes are slow enough to allow the necessary limit theorems to function .",
    "* ` stationary ' means that between pieces the probabilities hardly change , and ` piecewise ' means that these properties hold between phase transitions which are described using renormalization methods ( see wallace , 2005 ) . * ` ergodic ' means that in the long term , correlated sequences of symbols are generated at an average rate equal to their ( joint ) probabilities .    more specifically , the essence of ` adiabatic ' is that , when the information source is parametrized according to some appropriate scheme , within continuous ` pieces ' of that parametrization , alterations in parameter values occur slowly enough so that the information source @xmath49 remains as close to stationary and ergodic as needed to put to work the fundamental limit theorems of information theory . in view of ,",
    "the shannon uncertainty of @xmath49 can be stated more specifically by ( see e.g. cover and thomas , 1991 ) : @xmath50= \\lim_{n { { \\longrightarrow}}\\infty } \\frac{\\log[n(n)]}{n}.\\ ] ] .",
    "we recall how the information source uncertainty was defined as in equation .",
    "this is quite analogous to the free energy density of a physical system , equation , and the relevance to a cognitive process can be explained by the following steps .",
    "for instance , feynman ( 1996 ) provides a series of physical examples ( based in part on the research of c. h. bennett into the thermodynamics of computing ( bennett , 1982 ) where this homology is , in fact , an identity , at least for very simple systems .",
    "bennett ( 1982 ) argues , in terms of idealized irreducibly elementary computing machines , that the information contained in a message can be viewed as the work saved by not needing to recompute what has been transmitted , or as feynman ( 1996 ) puts it : the information contained in a message is proportional to the amount of free energy density needed to erase it .",
    "the essential argument is that computing , in any form , takes work .",
    "thus the more complicated a cognitive process , measured by its information source uncertainty , the greater its energy consumption , and our ability to provide energy to the brain is limited : typically , a unit of brain tissue consumes an order of magnitude more energy than a unit of any other tissue .    the less information available to us concerning an event , the higher is its entropy , and information retrieved is not without a cost in expenditure of energy , where ` cost ' may be interpreted as the necessary number of bits needed to encode a message .",
    "the thermodynamic minimum of energy in terms of bits of information is @xmath51 erg / bit ( @xmath52 erg / nat ) .",
    "so efficiency in an information system is essentially when there is the minimum amount of energy expended in retrieving information .",
    "specifically , if @xmath53 is taken to denote the free energy , then taking @xmath54 is to denote the minimum number of nats / sec , the efficiency of the system is given by @xmath55 ( see e.g. berger , 1971 ) .    in a similar spirit",
    "to bennett s work , li and vitnyi ( 1992 ) consider the thermodynamic costs of computation and how certain thermodynamic considerations can give a recursively invariant notion of ` cognitive distance ' using a kind of billiard dynamics approach . in this case",
    "a minimal cognitive distance between two objects will correspond to the minimal amount of work expended for a given cognitive transformation of objects , either by some computational procedure or by some neurocognitive function of the brain .",
    "a higher descriptive level leading to more complex and protracted algorithms , then leads to greater kolmogorov complexity ( li and vitnyi , 1993 ) . as a particular application of the bennett / feynman ideas in the global workspace setting , wallace ( 2007 ) argues that the cognitive disorder of ` inattentional blindness ' emerges as a thermodynamic limit on processing capacity in a topologically - fixed global workspace , i.e. one which has been strongly configured about a particular task .",
    "institutional and machine generalizations seem clear .",
    "many cognitive processes exhibit the patterns of dynamical systems ( see e.g. glazebrook and wallace , 2009a ) . in such systems",
    "one aims to unify the internal and external symmetries , and to be able to reduce vast myriad  like network configurations into manageable schemes involving the corresponding equivalence classes analogous to those already mentioned in source encoding / decoding , etc . in  [ rd - function ] ( see also  [ equiv - info ] below ) . a precise way of doing this lies within the categorical concept known as a _ groupoid _ ( see brown , 2006 ; connes , 1994 ; weinstein , 1996 ) .",
    "in essence a groupoid @xmath56 consists of both a set of objects @xmath57 and a set of morphisms , or ` arrows ' , each of which project to an object in @xmath57 , and all such morphisms admit an inverse .",
    "the most familiar example of a groupoid , as known to students of algebra , is that of a ` group ' where there is a single object ( ` the identity ' )",
    ". hence groupoids can be viewed as extensions of the ` group ' concept to sets of _ multiple identities _ thus providing a wide scope of applications to the dynamics of neurocognitive and socio ",
    "bioinformatic systems ( see e.g. baianu et al . , 2006 ; glazebrook and wallace , 2009a , 2009b ; golubitsky and stewart , 2006 ; stewart et al . , 2003 ; wallace 2005 ; wallace and fullilove , 2008 ) .",
    "a groupoid can be depicted by @xmath58^{{\\alpha } } \\ar[r]_{{\\beta } } & x}\\ ] ] where the groupoid morphisms @xmath59 onto objects , are called the _",
    "range _ and _ source maps _ , respectively .",
    "informally , the groupoid represents a feature of built in reciprocity between its algebraic structures , internalizing and externalizing the prevailing symmetries .",
    "the morphisms @xmath60 satisfy certain algebraic relations of associativity , existence of two - sided identities , etc .",
    "( details can be seen in e.g. brown , 2006 ; connes , 1994 ; weinstein , 1996 ) .",
    "a groupoid can here be understood in relationship to a linkage by a meaningful path of an information source dual to a cognitive process for which the underlying principle is that : _",
    "states @xmath61 in a set @xmath62 are related by the groupoid morphism if and only if there exists a high probability grammatical path connecting them to the same base point , and the tuning across the various possible ways in which that can happen  the different cognitive languages  parametrizes the set of equivalence relations and creates the groupoid .",
    "_    [ ex2 ] since we have already mentioned equivalence classes in the context of source encoding / decoding , it seems appropriate to see how an equivalence relation @xmath63 defined on ( a set ) @xmath57 takes shape as a groupoid .",
    "here we have the two projections @xmath64 , and a product @xmath65 whenever @xmath66 together with an identity , namely @xmath67 , for each @xmath68 . moreover , the essential equivalence relations ( classes ) derived from a systems space ( network ) arise from the orbit equivalence relation of some groupoid @xmath56 acting on that space ( see e.g. weinstein , 1996 ) . in the context of",
    "connected ( sub)networks / graphs which can reduced to equivalence classes , natural groupoid structures come about in accordance with equivalence classes of relations @xmath69 , as above , that is simply interpreted as having an edge linking node @xmath39 to node @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , a groupoid ( of equivalence relations ) admits an underlying graph structure via its implicit scheme of objects and morphisms between objects ( for details , see e.g. brown , 2006 ) .",
    "thus we have the two - way associations whereby ` objects ' can be identified with ` nodes ' , and ` morphisms ' identified with ` edges ' in groupoids ( of equivalence relations ) and networks , respectively:@xmath71      an important observation about multi - tasking in institutional and distributed cognitive systems concerns how the various submodules interact .",
    "when a given subnetwork is represented in its groupoid form , then such interactions naturally can be realized in terms of _ groupoid actions _ , a topic that warrants further attention .",
    "then we would like to see the overall cognitive system in terms of such interacting groupoids and designed by an ` atlas ' of the latter , and one , as shown in glazebrook and wallace ( 2009a ) , containing the representation of several possible emergent ` giant components ' induced by the outcome of local group(oid ) actions within the workspace ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "a workable concept seems to be that of a _ groupoid atlas _",
    "( bak et al . , 2006 ) which provides a schematic representation for coupling interactions between multi - agent systems and uses a pasting together of the local dynamic groupoid actions with the net effect of a ` global ' groupoid .",
    "one commences from a family of dynamically interacting groupoids @xmath72 where each groupoid has the same set of objects ;",
    "this family is called a _ single domain _ or",
    "_ multiple groupoid_. _ a groupoid atlas _ is then defined as a set with a covering by patches each of which comprise a single domain with global action , representing the local processing which is then globalized across the atlas .",
    "this is a desirable effect and one particularly suited to logically inscribing processors or sensors ( the ` agents ' ) within the cognitive modules of the workspace . as a descriptive mechanism",
    ", this atlas has the advantage of admiting a weaker structure compared with that of a conventional manifold since no condition of compatibility between arbitrary overlaps of the patches is necessary .",

    "the multiphase chemical equilibrium is a local process ; the overall system itself may in general remain in a state far - from - equilibrium .    according to berger ( 1971 ) , ` nature ' then automatically performs the analogous minimization in multiphase chemical equilibrium , and when an information system encounters an environment , the reaction on the molecular level follows these principles .",
    "thus the free energy of the combined system and the environment is minimized , although this is at the cost of the system s free energy capacity where there will inevitably be some heat dissipation .",
    "eventually the system can fine - tune its coding mechanism and re - configures itself for the task of gaining more specialized knowledge about its environment , and thanks to newly acquired information , it may engage the latter to its advantage along with detecting other drifting cells of information .",
    "how such optimizing procedures can be realized in an evolutionary context , is of course one of the main tasks of applying rate distortion arguments ( cf wallace and wallace , 1998 , 1999 , 2008 , 2009 ) . for instance , a scenario studied in tlusty ( 2007 , 2008 ) concerns how the genetic code maps the 64 nucleotide triplets ( codons ) to 20 amino acids . in terms of this mapping",

    "the partial derivatives @xmath150 are analogous to thermodynamic forces in a chemical system , and may be subject to override by external physiological driving mechanisms as shown in ( wallace , 2005 ; wallace and fullilove , 2008 ) along with further extensions of these dynamical procedures .",
    "equation is ` general ' in the sense that we do not necessarily assume the symmetry condition @xmath151 which in this latter case expresses onsager s 4-th law of thermodynamics ( see e.g. ( 3.7 ) in kurzynski , 2006 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath152 $ ] is to be viewed empirically , in the same spirit as the slope and intercept of a regression model , and may have a structure far different when compared to the more basic , more familiar chemical or physical processes . generally , information sources are notoriously one  way in time , as exemplified by the patent linguistic scarcity of palindromic structures that do actually make some sense .      equations and can be derived in a simple parameter - free covariant manner which relies on the underlying topology of the information source space implicit to a process .",
    "different cognitive phenomena have , according to our development , dual information sources , and we are interested in the local properties of the system near a particular reference state .",
    "we impose a topology on the system , so that , near a particular ` language ' @xmath62 , dual to an underlying cognitive process , there is ( in some sense ) an open set @xmath153 of closely similar languages @xmath154 , such that @xmath62 and @xmath154 are subsets of @xmath153 .",
    "note that it may be necessary to coarse - grain the system s responses to define these information sources .",
    "the problem is to proceed in such a way as to preserve the underlying essential topology , while eliminating ` high frequency noise ' .",
    "the formal tools for this can be found in e.g. burago et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "since the information sources dual to the cognitive processes are similar , for all pairs of languages @xmath155 in @xmath153 , it is possible to make use of the following :    * create an embedding alphabet which includes all symbols allowed to both of them . *",

    "such cognitive - epigenetic systems which are driven by stochastic and noise driven diffusion processes , may be suitably conditioned to admitting further noise perturbations that lead to a degree of stochastic resonance capable of amplifying a relatively weak signal or actually reducing the level of randomness in the system .",
    "such resonance may function as a catalyst towards the system s self - organization and complexity , in the same way as open systems far - from - equilibrium require internal amplification in order to reach a macroscopic dynamical structure ( gammaitoni et al .",

    "we introduce several examples for which part of the purpose will be to motivate introduction of the it principle which we will do so below .",
    "[ rdd - ex1 ] firstly , for a simple gaussian channel with noise having zero mean and variance @xmath179 , we have @xmath180 the simplest possible onsager relation becomes @xmath181 in which the term @xmath182 represents the force of an ` entropic wind ' which is a kind of internal dissipation inevitably driving the real  time system of interacting cognitive information sources toward greater distortion .",
    "equation has a solution @xmath183 , showing in this case that the average distortion increases monotonically with time .",
    "following wallace ( 2009a ,  7.2 ) , this example shows that such a system will inevitably succumb to a relentless entropic force , requiring _ a constant free energy expenditure for maintenance of some fixed average distortion within the system s communication between them_. the distortion in this case will , without free energy input , have a time dependence @xmath184 , with @xmath185 montonically increasing in @xmath164 , eventually leading to the punctuated failure of the system .",
    "further , in the einstein diffusion equation , a straightforward argument of wallace ( 2009a ,  7.2)shows that the standard deviation of the particle position increases in proportion to @xmath186 .",
    "thus , whereas we do not expect the high correlations of an information source to exhibit typical brownian motion , it does seem to be the case that the _ distortion _ in communication between the interacting cognitive modules within the appropriate context of the onsager relations , does display brownian motion which may be of bounded variation in certain cases .      here",
    "we consider different cognitive developmental subprocesses of gene expression characterized by information sources @xmath187 interacting through chemical or other signals , and assume _ that different processes become each other s principal environments _ which is a suitable hypothesis within a broad coevolutionary context .",
    "let @xmath188 where the @xmath189 represent other relevant parameters , and @xmath190 .",

    "the equilibrium solution is @xmath205 .",
    "the difference between and is that whereas in the former case , the distortion grows directly as the square root of the elapsed time , equation reveals there is a finite , equilibrium , average distortion that is inversely proportional to the available environmental or informational free energy that the interacting systems can implement in order to navigate their actions",

    "together with the multiphase equilibrium problem of  [ multiphase ] we have so far pursued a theme of how the stochastic simulation of biochemical systems closely parallels that of evolutionary  genetic systems .",
    "an initial observation here , and one that will motivate further ideas , is that a stochastic differential equation of the type should in principle model the dynamics of large , intricate networks that are constrained by the costs of actual computational time , which seems relevant in certain senses to many epigenetic processes .",
    "the general setting for such processes often involves that of an it stochastic de ( viz _ it process _ ) and this is how we intend to view as a kind of ` master equation ' .    for the readers sake ,",
    "we remark why such a level of mathematical formality is necessary by recalling a basic difficulty : the sample paths @xmath213 of brownian motion are not in general functions of bounded variation , so that @xmath214 is not defined as for that of the usual riemann - stieltjes integral .",
    "one may start by supposing that for almost all samples , @xmath215 in is independent of future brownian motion @xmath216 ; otherwise said @xmath217 is an _ adapted _ stochastic process .",
    "putting it another way , the information available at a given time includes the history of the process at that time .",
    "more generally , the stochastic process may be taken to be _ predictable _ in order to define the it integral of the equation ( see e.g.  2.3 of kunita , 1990 and appendix [ appendix - a ] here ) .",
    "on the other hand , there is part justification for making assumptions of ( local ) boundedness of variation in the brownian motion incurred via distortion , and in particular , the adapted condition , points to those examples and observations already quoted that concern the dispensation of available free energy .",
    "firstly , in view of example [ rdd - ex1 ] we may expect a constant free energy expenditure for maintenance of some fixed average distortion in communication between the interacting cognitive modules .",
    "secondly , given a fixed rate of available information free energy , the increasing allowable response time _ decreases _ average distortion in the interaction ( example [ coev - ex1 ] ) , and thirdly , the possibility that finite , equilibrium , average distortion is actually inversely proportional to the available environmental or informational free energy that the interacting systems can utilize ( example [ coev - ex2 ] ) .",
    "however , to make matters precise , it is appropriate to consider the formalities of some filtered probability space @xmath218 , where @xmath219 ( see appendix [ appendix - a ] ) and postulate a multidimensional stochastic process given by the it integral of the master equation : @xmath220.\\ ] ] in order to state the conditions for which this process is well - defined , we first express in the simplified form @xmath221 then following harrison ( 1985 , chapter 4 ) :    * @xmath222 is measurable with respect to @xmath223 . *",
    "@xmath224 is an adapted stochastic process , and @xmath225 , for all @xmath226 . *",
    "the integral of ` drift ' , @xmath227 , is a continuous and adapted variation - finite ( vf ) process .    granted that our observations about the local boundedness of the ( rate distortion ) brownian motion as essentially fulfilling these conditions , we now have an explicit stochastic model for the role of cross - talk , its distortion , the inherent time constraints of the different cognitive modules , as well as the overall available free energy density , where the @xmath228 parameter structure represents the full  scale fragmentation of the system in the presence of some weiner noise .",

    "further , accurate and efficient communicating systems require a greater channel capacity , and keeping in mind the analogy with free energy density , a higher rate of metabolism is necessary and further costs are incurred ( cf  [ feynman ] ) .",
    "failure to provide such resources equates to a decline in processing , possibly to a point of disintegration .",
    "on the other hand , increased communication between the system s cognitive modules , depending on the availability of free energy , will usually be followed up by a phase transition ( in essence , this is what the holonomy groupoid encodes as shown in glazebrook and wallace ( 2009a ) ) inducing further complexity into the systems behavior . in principle",
    "one might envisage an associated _ holonomy groupoid atlas _ for interacting cognitive - dynamical systems based on synchronous ( geometric ) phase transitions of the various constituents .",
    "this would amount to a broad - scale descriptive artifact for the purpose of understanding the cumulative transitional mechanisms of living processes that may eventually uncover some even deeper conceptual issues .",
    "stochastic processes are perhaps more in keeping with what the world expects compared to a strictly deterministic approach , though the former are likely to entail higher computational costs and some neuroscientific work in this area is aimed at reducing such costs ( cf manninen et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "integration of the onsager stochastic differential equation towards a multidimensional it process , leads naturally to a stochastic flow which in our formulation diffuses across the atlas through mainly noisy channels ( cf  [ multiphase ] ) . such evidence is provided by tlusty s rate - distortion analysis of the genetic coding map where it is shown that the evolution of the code unfolds as a smooth flow on the codon space as realized in tlusty ( 2007 ) . with such examples in mind , we have presented here a novel development , very much in tune with the `` flow '' nature of living systems as once envisaged by bertalanffy and prigogine , while at the same time our approach using rate distortion principles embraces many central features of related theories of cognition such as those proposed in atlan and cohen ( 1998 ) , baars ( 1988 ) , baars and franklin ( 2003 ) , cohen and harel ( 2007 ) and maturana and varela ( 1980a , 1980b ) .",
