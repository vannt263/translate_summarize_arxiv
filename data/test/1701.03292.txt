    "numerous complex systems in nature and society can be simplified and abstracted by describing them as networks , in which nodes and edges represent constituent elements and their interactions , respectively .",
    "extensive studies @xcite have revealed common statistical features of real - world complex networks , such as the small - world property @xcite , the scale - free property @xcite , community structures @xcite , and degree - degree correlations @xcite . in order to clarify the origin of these features and/or properties of various dynamics on such networks",
    ", so many network models have been proposed so far . in most of previous network models ,",
    "the number of nodes @xmath4 , namely the network size , is treated as an a priori given parameter .",
    "the network size can then take any value , and , as is often the case , the limit of infinite @xmath4 is taken in order to simplify the analysis .",
    "thus , these models implicitly assumes that networks are stably present no matter how large networks grow .",
    "this assumption is , however , not always valid in real - world systems . in an ecological network representing a closed ecosystem , for example ,",
    "too many species destabilize the ecosystem and the number of species ( nodes in the ecological network ) can not increase unboundedly @xcite . also in a trading network",
    ", too many firms make the network fragile because of unstable cartels @xcite , increase of financial complexity @xcite , possible large - scale chain - bankruptcy , and other risks @xcite . as in these examples , due to intrinsic instability of large - scale networks ,",
    "some sort of networks have their own limit in sizes only below which they can be stable @xcite .",
    "it is important to study limit sizes of connected networks and find a way to control them .",
    "such information for _ functional networks _ is particularly crucial , because unstable functional networks are directly connected to the instability of our modern society supported by them .",
    "functions provided by functional networks are guaranteed by global connectivity and normal operation of each node ( or edge ) . however , the larger a network grows , the lower the probability that all the nodes operate normally becomes . when failures are caused by",
    "_ overloads _ , even a few failures can spread to the entire network through a cascading process , which leads the fatal breakdown of the network @xcite .",

    "our analytical results and their numerical confirmations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : sammary ] is devoted to the summary and some remarks .",
    "in this section , we outline the model of cascading failures induced by temporally fluctuating loads @xcite . in functional networks such as power grids , the internet , or trading networks ,",
    "some sort of  flow \" ( electric current in a power grid , packet flow in the internet , and money flow in a trading network ) realizes their functions . and",
    "flow , at the same time , plays a role of  loads \" in these networks .",
    "the load on a node usually fluctuates temporally and the node fails if the instantaneous value of the load exceeds the node capacity . since flux fluctuations at a node exhibit the same scaling behavior with fluctuations of the number of non - interacting random walkers on the node @xcite , kishore _",
    "modeled fluctuating loads by random walkers moving on a network and calculated the overload probability that the number of walkers exceeds the range allowed for a node @xcite .",
    "the model of cascading failures employed in the present work utilizes this overload probability .    in a connected and undirected network with @xmath5 edges ,",
    "the probability @xmath6 that @xmath7 random walkers ( loads ) exist on a node of degree @xmath8 is presented by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of walkers and @xmath11 is the stationary probability to find a random walker on a node of degree @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this leads a natural definition of the capacity @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a real positive parameter characterizing the node tolerance , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the average and the standard deviation of @xmath6 , which are given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . since the overload probability @xmath19 is the probability of @xmath7 to exceed @xmath12 , we have @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the regularized incomplete beta function @xcite and @xmath22 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath23 .    using the above overload probability , the cascade process of overload failures is defined as follows @xcite :    \\(i ) prepare an initial connected , uncorrelated , and undirected network @xmath24 with @xmath4 nodes and @xmath5 edges ,",
    "in which totally @xmath10 random walkers exist , and determine the capacity @xmath12 of each node according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : capacity ] ) .",
    "@xmath10 is set as @xmath25 , where the parameter @xmath26 is the load carried by a single edge .",
    "\\(ii ) at each cascade step @xmath27 , reassign @xmath28 walkers to the network @xmath29 at step @xmath27 , where the total load @xmath28 is given by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the total number of edges in the network @xmath29 and @xmath1 is a real positive parameter .",
    "\\(iii ) for every node in @xmath29 , calculate the overload probability given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath8 are the initial degree and the degree of the node at cascade step @xmath27 , and remove nodes from @xmath29 with this probability .",
    "\\(iv ) repeat ( ii ) and ( iii ) until no node is removed in the procedure ( iii ) .",
    "the reduction of the total load in the procedure ( ii ) corresponds to realistic situations in which the total load is reduced to some extent during a cascade process to prevent the fatal breakdown of the network function .",
    "when a company goes bankrupt on a trading network , for example , a large - scale chain bankruptcy would be prevented by the reduction of the total debt ( loads ) realized by financial bailout measures .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 characterizes how quickly the total load decreases with decreasing the network size , which is called the load reduction parameter .    during the cascade , the network @xmath29 might be disconnected even though the initial network @xmath24 is connected . in such a case , a walker on a connected component can not jump to other components .",
    "therefore , the amount of walkers on each component is conserved in the random walk process .",
    "the overload probability then becomes dependent on how the total load is distributed to disconnected components .",
    "thus the overload probability deviates from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftau ] ) .",
    "this deviation is , however , small and the effect of disconnected components can be approximately neglected as argued in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . the validity of this approximation will be confirmed in the next section by numerical simulations in which walkers distributed proportionally to the number of edges in each component can not move to other components .",
    "we examine the stability of a network under cascading overload failures described above by analyzing the size @xmath34 of the largest connected component in the network after completed the cascading process .",
    "if @xmath34 is very small , the initial network is considered to be unstable .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 obviously depends on the initial network size @xmath4 , and the maximum value @xmath0 of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath4 provides the upper limit of the size of stable connected networks in a given cascading condition .",
    "the surviving component of size @xmath0 may experience further cascading failures after a long time , but simultaneously the component can grow during this period .",
    "in the competition between the growth and decay processes , the component smaller than @xmath0 can , in substance , stably grow up to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the connected network size fluctuates around this maximum size @xmath0 .",
    "in order to calculate the maximum stable size @xmath34 , we construct a master equation for the probability @xmath35 that a randomly chosen node has the degree @xmath8 at cascade step @xmath27 and the initial degree @xmath36 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce another probability @xmath37 of a node adjacent to a randomly chosen node of degree @xmath8 to experience an overload failure at cascade step @xmath27 .",
    "this probability is independent of @xmath8 for uncorrelated networks and is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average degree of @xmath29 .",
    "we then formulate the master equation for @xmath35 as    @xmath40+\\delta_{k0}f_{w_{\\tau-1}}(k_{0},k')\\biggr\\}. \\label{eq : pikk}\\ ] ]    in this equation , we do not remove overloaded nodes actually but leave them in the system as zero - degree nodes , which makes the theoretical treatment easier .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation represents the probability that a degree-@xmath41 node in @xmath42 becomes a node of degree @xmath8 at cascade step @xmath27 .",
    "the first term describes the situation that the degree-@xmath41 node does not experience an overload failure and @xmath43 nodes adjacent to this node fail .",
    "the second term stands for the case that the degree-@xmath41 node itself fails and becomes a zero - degree node .",

    ", we stop this iterative calculation at step @xmath46 satisfying the condition @xmath47 which implies that the expectation number of overloaded nodes becomes less than unity .",
    "we can obtain the largest connected component size @xmath34 at the final cascade step @xmath46 from the degree distribution @xmath48 of @xmath49 which is given by @xmath50 . employing the generating function formalism",

    "( [ eq : ntau ] ) does not mean that @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath4 because @xmath56 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "first , we calculated @xmath34 for the erds - rnyi random graph ( errg ) as an initial network @xmath24 . in this case , the binomial degree distribution function for @xmath24 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in this work ,",
    "we fix the initial average degree as @xmath59 .",
    "although initial networks having this average degree are not completely connected with isolated nodes at a very low rate , this does not affect our conclusion .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows @xmath34 as a function of the initial network size @xmath4 for various values of the load reduction parameter @xmath1 . for these results , the node tolerance parameter @xmath14 and the load carried by a single edge , @xmath26 ,",

    "[ fig1 ] is exactly equal to @xmath4 as long as @xmath73 , regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the network never experiences overload failures until the network grows up to @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is determined by @xmath75 which does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "when the network grows larger than @xmath74 , it starts to decay by initial failures and subsequent avalanche of failures .",
    "the largest component size @xmath34 after the cascade then becomes smaller than @xmath4 , but still increases with @xmath4 , at least unless @xmath4 is much larger than @xmath74 . for @xmath76 , when @xmath4 exceeds a certain value @xmath77 , @xmath34 rapidly decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 becomes maximum at @xmath78 .",
    "this maximum value of @xmath34 is nothing but @xmath0 mentioned at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ subsec : largest ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] clearly shows that the maximum stable size @xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because a large value of @xmath1 , namely a rapid decrease of the total load @xmath28 during the cascade , prevents large - scale cascading failures in our model .    the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 is closely related to the percolation transition by cascading overload failures . as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a critical value @xmath79 above which the largest component size diverges in proportion to @xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , @xmath34 goes to infinity as @xmath80 for @xmath2 , which implies the absence ( divergence ) of @xmath0 . on the other hand , for @xmath81",

    "such a behavior is demonstrated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the errg .",

    "the degree distribution has asymptotically a power - law form , i.e. , @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the average degree @xmath97 can be controlled by @xmath91 for a specific value of @xmath92 .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines in fig .  [ fig2 ] represent the results for @xmath69 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "although these values of @xmath92 are not sufficiently small due to the restriction of computational resources to calculate @xmath99 iteratively and obtain @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntau ] ) , the maximum stable sizes for the sf networks are obviously greater than that for the errg .",
    "this implies that an sf network is more stable than the errg with the same average degree , which is consistent with the previous result showing the robustness of sf networks against cascading overload failures @xcite .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath0 for several combinations of the node tolerance parameter @xmath14 and the load carried by a single edge @xmath26 . the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] clearly indicate that @xmath0 increases with both @xmath14 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is obvious that the larger the node tolerance parameter @xmath14 , the more stable the network consisting of tolerant nodes becomes .",
    "the monotonous increase of @xmath0 with @xmath26 is due to the fact that @xmath100 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftau ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath26 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the maximum stable size @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is roughly proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath101 is about @xmath102 to @xmath103 independently of @xmath1 , unless @xmath1 is close to @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is also insensitive to the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath26 , as well as the degree inhomogeneity .",
    "furthermore , as shown by fig .",
    "1(b ) , the ratio @xmath67 slowly decreases with @xmath4 if @xmath104 but turns to a rapid decrease when @xmath67 becomes less than @xmath105 .",
    "these empirical facts give us significant information about the stability of the network .",
    "if the size of the largest component after cascading overload failures falls close to @xmath106 to @xmath107 of the size of the network before the cascade , the network is in immediate danger of a fatal breakdown . in order to accomplish further stable growth of the network",
    ", we need to raise the load reduction parameter @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath101 is peculiar to the present cascade model .",
    "however , it has been found that qualitative properties of our model are robust against changes in details of the model as long as failures are induced by temporally fluctuating loads @xcite .",
    "therefore , even for a real - world functional network , the ratio @xmath67 is supposed to decrease drastically with @xmath4 when this ratio falls below a certain value .",
    "our results suggest that we must take measures to prevent a fatal breakdown of a functional network if the decreasing rate of @xmath67 with increasing the network size becomes higher than its ordinary value .",
    "we have studied how large a functional network exposed to cascading overload failures can grow stably and evaluated the maximum stable size @xmath0 above which the network would face the crisis of a fatal breakdown .",
    "to this end , we employed the model of cascading overload failures triggered by fluctuating loads @xcite which is described by random walkers moving on the network @xcite . in this model ,",
    "how quickly the total load is reduced during the cascade to prevent the fatal breakdown is quantified by the load reduction parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum stable size @xmath0 was calculated by using the generating function technique and solving the master equation for the probability @xmath35 that a randomly chosen node has the degree @xmath8 at cascade step @xmath27 and the initial degree @xmath36 .",
    "our results show that @xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath1 and diverges at a certain value @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that the faster the total load is reduced during the cascade , the larger the network can grow , and we can realize an arbitrarily large network if the total load is sufficiently quickly reduced ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it has been also clarified that the degree inhomogeneity improves stability of the network .",
    "more precisely , for a given @xmath108 , @xmath0 for a scale - free network is larger than that for the erds - rnyi random graph with the same average degree .",
    "furthermore , from the empirical relation between @xmath0 and the network size @xmath82 giving @xmath0 , we argued how one detects and avoids the crisis of the network breakdown .",
    "the present results suggest that a certain relative size of the largest component size after cascading failures could be a signature for the impending network collapse . for further stable growth of the network , a more rapid reduction of the total load",
    "is required during a cascade of overload failures .    in this paper",
    ", we investigated only uncorrelated networks , while most of real - world functional networks have correlations between nearest neighbor degrees . for a correlated network , the probability @xmath109 of a node adjacent to a randomly chosen node of degree @xmath8 to experience an overload failure at cascade step @xmath27 depends on @xmath8 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of uncorrelated networks , where @xmath109 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi2 ] ) is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the analysis becomes much more complicated for correlated networks than the present study .",
    "however , we suppose that our conclusion does not change qualitatively though @xmath0 depends on the strength of the degree correlation .",
    "a positive ( negative ) degree correlation simply makes a network robust ( fragile ) against various types of failures @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that also for our failure dynamics the degree correlation merely shifts the value of @xmath0 upward or downward .",
    "nevertheless , the relation between the stability of a functional network and its size must be strongly affected by the model of cascading failures .",
    "we hope that the problem of spontaneous instability in largely grown networks will be studied more extensively in diverse ways and models .",

    "<S> we study how large functional networks can grow stably under possible cascading overload failures and evaluated the maximum stable network size above which even a small - scale failure would cause a fatal breakdown of the network . employing a model of cascading failures induced by temporally fluctuating loads , the maximum stable size @xmath0 has been calculated as a function of the load reduction parameter @xmath1 that characterizes how quickly the total load is reduced during the cascade . if we reduce the total load sufficiently fast ( @xmath2 ) , the network can grow infinitely . otherwise , @xmath0 is finite and increases with @xmath1 . for a fixed @xmath3 , @xmath0 for a scale - free network is larger than that for an exponential network with the same average degree . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how one detects and avoids the crisis of a fatal breakdown of the network from the relation between the sizes of the initial network and the largest component after an ordinarily occurring cascading failure . </S>"
