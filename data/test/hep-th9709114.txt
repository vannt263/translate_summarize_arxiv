    "matrix theory @xcite appears to capture a remarkable amount of the nonperturbative structure of string / m - theory . at generic values of the moduli , most of the localized states of the latter are black holes",

    "first steps in this direction have recently been taken @xcite-@xcite ; our purpose here is to summarize the results ( with a few extensions ) , as well as to argue for a general picture of black hole structure .",
    "we begin in section 2 with a discussion of the geometry we are trying to reproduce  classical eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the focus is on five - dimensional ( near)bps black holes @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) , as these are best understood from the standpoint of string theory .",
    "we then point out a few properties of supergravitons as probes of the geometry , and indicate how matrix theory reproduces various asymptotic features of the metric .    adapting a d - brane calculation of maldacena @xcite",
    ", we reproduce in section 3 the near - extremal black hole entropy as the entropy of the noncritical string theory that describes matrix theory on @xmath0 @xcite . rephrasing the calculation in natural m - theory variables",
    "renders the interpretation of many formulae transparent .",
    "the basic theme will be that black hole thermodynamics is generalized supersymmetric yang - mills statistical mechanics , in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "section 4 presents some speculations on the dynamics of black holes in matrix theory , summarizes our results and lists a few directions for further research .",
    "the class of black holes and black strings we will consider arises in 11d supergravity on @xmath1 @xcite . take the coordinates of @xmath2 to be ( @xmath3 ) ; sometimes we write @xmath4 in spherical coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath0 will be ( @xmath6 ) . a black string stretched along @xmath7",
    "may be constructed as a bound state of fivebranes , membranes , and gravitons of the 11d theory in the configuration  .",
    "[ config ] compactification of @xmath7 on a circle produces a black hole in five - dimensional spacetime .",

    "one can further choose special polarizations of supergraviton (  the 567 component of @xmath22 ) such that the connection term vanishes .",
    "wavepackets of this sort behave as if they are scalars , hence travel light cones of the 11d metric  precisely the probes we want .",
    "a wavepacket @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) comoves with the wave bound to the black string and is therefore near - bps . in a sense",
    ", it adiabatically approaches and crosses the horizon .",
    "the wave equation @xmath26 reduces to n^2(r)_eff^2=^2  , [ probe ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "thus the effective dynamics of wavepackets is equivalent to geometric optics with the spatially dependent index of refraction @xmath30 .",
    "since the index increases as the radius decreases , null geodesics are focussed onto the string ( gravitational lensing ) .    in the next section",
    "we will exhibit a matrix theory configuration for near - extremal black strings / holes of the type .",
    "the effective dynamics maps onto an equivalent d - brane system ( 5 + 1d sym ) , although the interpretation is rather different .",
    "one of the most important distinctions is that , whereas the d - brane moduli space describes slowly moving massive particles , the matrix model moduli space describes the transverse motion of _ massless _ particles ( the supergravitons )  thus giving direct information about the causal structure .    calculations in this d - brane system @xcite reproduce all @xmath31 terms in the near - extremal geometry .",
    "curved space geometry is a _ low - energy _",
    "approximation in matrix theory .",
    "the dynamics of the probe - black hole system in @xmath2 is described by matrix higgs fields in the d - brane sym on @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) =  , where the vector components run over ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the @xmath34 variables are massive , schematically @xmath35 ^ 2\\sim     integrating out @xmath34 yields an effective action that is an expansion in powers of derivatives of the light fields @xmath36 and inverse powers of @xmath37 .",
    "all the @xmath38 terms in the asymptotic metric come from integrating out @xmath34 at one loop @xcite .",
    "bound to the string is none other than the @xmath39 ` coulomb ' interaction of matrix theory @xcite ; the @xmath40 becomes @xmath41 when smeared over the internal @xmath0 .",
    "] thus , in matrix theory @xmath42 _ is _ an optical index ",
    "it is generated by the spatially dependent vacuum polarization whose effect is a spatially varying dielectric function seen by the light degrees of freedom .",
    "however , this correspondence makes it clear that the light - cone structure of spacetime is indeed only a low - energy approximation in matrix theory .",
    "this structure is defined by the trajectories of massless particles , such as the probe wavepackets considered above .",
    "a supergraviton probe will only follow the classical black hole light cones in this ( moduli space ) approximation ,  when the @xmath43 variables are sufficiently heavy that they may be consistently integrated out . near the black hole ( the ` stretched horizon ' in black hole physics @xcite ; the ` stadium region ' in d - brane terminology @xcite ) , this approximation breaks down .",
    "thus in the schwarzschild - type coordinate frame intrinsic to the matrix description , the classical causal structure and classical notions of information propagation only make sense sufficiently far from the black hole ( or string in the present case ) .",
    "near the hole , spacetime literally becomes nonabelian , and the light cones are not meaningful ( at least in this coordinate frame ) .",
    "of course , the @xmath31 terms in the metric are all _ required _ by gauss law ",
    "they represent the energy of gauge fluxes carrying the bps or noether charges ( @xmath44 ) at infinity .",
    "it is more a relief than a triumph for matrix theory to reproduce them .",
    "subleading terms are allowed to depend sensitively on nonuniversal details  the wavefunction of the black hole and probe degrees of freedom , form factors for their scattering , etc .",
    "it may be that the precise black hole geometry is reproduced only in the large n limit , with all these effects taken into account .",
    "in other words , we need to understand how the einstein equations come out of matrix theory .",
    "it is encouraging that the behavior of supergraviton probes has the same form that one would expect to get from the abelianized moduli space approximation to matrix theory ",
    "the classical geometry acts as an ` optical medium ' whose optical index bends the trajectories of probes .",
    "* the entropy : * to discuss thermodynamic properties , we will postulate 1 ) that there exists some theory ( perhaps of noncritical strings @xcite ) whose large n dynamics formulates matrix theory on @xmath0 ; and 2 ) this theory has a regime in which it is well - approximated by 5 + 1d yang - mills with 16 supersymmetries .",
    "one can think of this auxilliary theory heuristically as the t - dual of the original matrix theory on all five circles of @xmath0 : @xmath45 thus the three charges correspond , respectively , to the rank @xmath46 of the gauge group , the instanton number , and the field momentum in the sym theory .",
    "this maps the system to a well - studied type iib d - brane system ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "n in matrix theory is supposed to be related to compactification of the longitudinal @xcite or light - front @xcite coordinate on a circle of radius @xmath47 . in matrix theory , branes wrapping / momenta are sym fluxes : @xmath48 note that the instanton is a solitonic string in 5 + 1d , and @xmath49 is its wrapping along the @xmath50 cycle .",
    "the configuration corresponds to exciting @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the sym theory .",
    "horowitz , maldacena , and strominger @xcite proposed an identification of the parameters of the classical geometry with ` brane charges ' @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volume of the @xmath55 spanned by the fivebrane , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the contributions of these ` constituents ' to the adm energy e_adm=_i=0,2,5(e_i+e_|i )  .",
    "we will argue below that the identifications are somewhat misleading , nevertheless they will serve our purpose for the moment .    in the classical supergravity solution ,",
    "one requires a balance of the pressures and tensions exerted by the various branes on the internal @xmath0 in order to have a nonsingular horizon at extremality ; in terms of the quantities , e_0e_|0=e_2e_|2=e_5e_|5  .",
    "[ balance ] we propose to interpret this as an equipartition of the ` invariant masses ' among the different bps charges , since the first of these is the invariant mass of a 1d gas , and the others are u - dual to such a quantity .",
    "note that @xmath47 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 act in various combinations as chemical potentials for the different branes ; for instance , decreasing @xmath58 and increasing @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 held fixed in order to keep @xmath61 constant ) increases the proportion of 2-branes relative to 5-branes .",
    "finally , we take @xmath62 in order to match imf dynamics .",
    "now consider a gas of instanton strings ( anti)winding along @xmath63 .",
    "instanton charge on a torus fractionalizes into n pieces , leading to a much longer effective string with a tension reduced by a factor 1/n .",
    "when we excite these strings , they will quickly enter the hagedorn phase because of their low tension .",
    "all quantum numbers of the system  energy , winding , momentum  are carried by a single long string .",
    "this is because the instanton string has by far the lightest excitations in the gauge theory ( due to its length being much longer than the size of the @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , the black hole entropy is that of a single long string carrying all the 2-brane and 5-brane energy and charges : @xmath64 the virasoro constraints on the instanton string determine its excitation level : n_l , r=  .",
    "[ levelno ] plugging in and using @xmath65 , one finds the well - known answer @xcite @xmath66 in the @xmath67 limit , fixed in order to have a finite entropy per unit length in the limit . ]",
    "a graviton with any nonzero transverse velocity can be boosted into the forward direction ( since the transverse momentum acts effectively as a mass with respect to longitudinal boosts ) .",
    "if matrix theory is lorentz covariant , in this limit there may be a sense in which _ all _ nonextremalities are effectively turned on .",
    "an instability develops @xcite , whereby the black string will become a black hole threaded by an extremal string .",
    "this suggests we keep @xmath47 , @xmath46 finite of order the size of the black hole in order to capture the relevant physics . ] finally , the fact that we get the right answer independent of the moduli of @xmath0 suggests that the above picture captures the thermodynamic properties of the noncritical string of matrix theory on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are a few simple generalizations of the above calculation .",
    "first , one can turn on other bps charges @xcite .",
    "the general extremal entropy is @xmath68^{1/2}\\ .",
    "\\label{gensbh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] halyo @xcite has considered the ( near)extremal black hole obtained from transverse rather than longitudinal gravitons and membranes ( the second term rather than the first in the last factor ) .",
    "this should correspond to turning off the momentum charge carried by the hagedorn string , replacing its contribution to the energy by that of the transverse zero- and two - brane charges that are turned on instead .",
    "second , the considerations of @xcite included hagedorn strings with angular momentum ; it is straightforward to translate the results to the context of matrix theory to obtain the entropy of spinning matrix black holes .",
    "third , nothing in the entropy calculation required @xmath69 ; this simply corresponds to choosing orthogonally intersecting membranes and fivebranes . allowing @xmath70 to make an angle @xmath71 with respect",
    "to @xmath72 means that there is a component of the membrane charge along the fivebrane  the branes intersect at angles . repeating the above exercise",
    ", one finds @xmath73\\nonumber\\\\      & = & ( \\frac{\\aleff}{\\lpl^2 } )          \\biggl[\\frac{vrr_5}{4\\lpl^8}\\;r_g^2\\biggr]^2 \\label{nonextent}\\\\      & & \\hskip -2.2cm\\times\\bigl[\\cos^2\\zeta\\;\\ch^2(\\alpha_2\\pm\\alpha_5 )      + \\sin^2\\zeta\\;\\ch^2(\\alpha_2+\\alpha_5)\\bigr]\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the extremal limit @xmath74 the entropy agrees with known results @xcite ; the nonextremal entropy has not been computed in supergravity , and it would be interesting to see if it matches .    * interpreting the perturbation from extremality : * it was claimed above that the identification is somewhat misleading . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the excitations of the instanton string .",
    "its transverse oscillators ( in green - schwarz formalism ) consist of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are spinor indices of the so(4 ) transverse to the @xmath0 ( the r - symmetry of the 5 + 1d sym ) , and @xmath79 are vectors and spinors of the so(4 ) little group in 5 + 1d .",
    "the center of mass mode of the string has the quantum numbers of the vector multiplet ( the string we are considering is the t - dual of the one in @xcite ) , and one can interpret the oscillator modes as coupling to fluctuations of the sym theory .",
    "therefore local oscillations along the hagedorn string are fluctuations of the hagedorn gas , equivalent to _ all types _ of local fluctuations of sym",
    ". this picture may carry over largely unmodified to the full noncritical interacting matrix string theory of @xcite ; there , the sym ` particles ' are microscopic noncritical strings , and the hagedorn string is simply a macroscopic string cut from the same cloth . dumping a lot of energy into the system",
    "forces it into the hagedorn phase , and the soft excitations of the hagedorn string indeed couple to _ all _ quantum numbers of the theory .",
    "this explains why , are valid over all of the parameter space of the 5 + 1d matrix theory .",
    "we now see why the identification is not the full story .",
    "the hagedorn gas contains fluctuations of all possible quantum numbers , not just those which have an expectation value such as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "rather , the energy above extremality is equipartitioned into all types of branes / antibranes according to their energy cost per quantum .",
    "what were called @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath10 in , are simply a characterization of the state of excitation of the hagedorn string .",
    "they were actually determined by the adm charges @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and the two ` pressure balance ' conditions .",
    "appearing in .",
    "perhaps one can get both pressure balance conditions by turning on other charges as in the discussion after . ]",
    "* the infalling probe : * we have seen that matrix theory encodes the key features of 5 + 1d black holes  their leading asymptotic geometry and their density of states . whether the rest of the structure is present is tantamount to an understanding of how general relativity appears as the effective theory .",
    "it is at least encouraging that , in supergravity , the motion of probes in the black hole background can be recast in the form of geometric optics . in matrix theory , this is just what one gets from the vacuum polarization effects of the heavy matrix degrees of freedom .",
    "the issue is whether these effects reproduce the right ` optical index ' .",
    "a legitimate question to ask of matrix theory concerns the fate of an infalling probe . in the exterior static coordinates intrinsic to the infinite momentum frame of matrix theory , when the probe reaches the ` stretched horizon ' of the black hole , it dissolves into the hagedorn gas of the black hole . in terms of matrices ,",
    "the evolution has the schematic form  , where @xmath86 denotes an excited black hole . to describe the proper motion of the probe one would like to at least approximately diagonalize the probe s collective field theory",
    "this would give an approximate evolution looking like  , at least until one gets close to the singularity .",
    "such a rediagonalization should involve passing to infalling coordinates , for instance by performing a sequence of boosts to keep the probe in its instantaneous rest frame . in general relativity ,",
    "the coordinate transformation that results has the form @xmath87 the first of these undoes the exponential redshift of static coordinates near the horizon , the second is a large shift of light - front time , and the last rewrites the radial variable as a kind of ` tortoise ' coordinate .",
    "the black hole interior has @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "but this is an analytic continuation of the imf description ; @xmath90 is the conjugate variable to @xmath91 , so the meaning of continuing past @xmath92 is unclear .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 may involve a continuation to complex eigenvalues of @xmath93 .",
    "even so , it seems clear that the sequence of boosts required to keep the probe in its rest frame involves boosts which mix light - front time and @xmath93 ; therefore , the probe proper time is a noncommutative ( matrix ) variable , and the evolution equation of the probe with respect to its proper time involves a moduli space approximation in this time coordinate .",
    "one might imagine that the classical singularity of the black hole is simply a reflection of the breakdown of this moduli space approximation in the time direction .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the boosts involved are matrix transformations ; it is possible that observables appropriate to asymptotic observers and observables measured in the infalling frame will not commute , leading to a form of black hole complementarity @xcite .",
    "* directions for further research : * it is important to expand the lexicon of translations between matrix theoretic and gravitational quantities , especially the gross geometrical features of the region near the black hole . it should be possible to calculate the properties of hawking radiation in the matrix theory approach . near extremality , the hawking temperature and the temperature of the hagedorn gas coincide @xcite .",
    "one can relate the hawking temperature to the temperature of the hagedorn string arbitrarily far from extremality @xcite _",
    "it would be nice to understand the factor of proportionality .",
    "there are also similar relations which need a proper explanation , for instance the formula ( n_ln_r)^1/2=nre_lcr_g^2 which relates the hagedorn string s excitation to the gravitational radius of the black hole . ; the excitations of @xmath94 are r - r fluctuations of the hagedorn string and are determined by equipartition .",
    "this is related to the fact that absorption of higher angular momenta proceeds via the worldsheet fermions @xcite . ]",
    "larsen @xcite has related @xmath95 to the area of the inner horizon .",
    "how are these reflected in the dynamics of probes ?",
    "perhaps the main lesson to be drawn from the above analysis is that black hole thermodynamics becomes conventional statistical mechanics in matrix theory .",
    "thus supergravity gives a whole host of predictions  for the ( 2,0 ) field theory governing matrix theory on @xmath55 , for @xmath96=4 sym on @xmath97 , and so on .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of these higher - dimensional black holes (  @xcite ) are currently not understood in string theory ; there is no weak coupling limit where the horizon is nonsingular near extremality .",
    "nevertheless , one might hope to directly study the nonextremal black hole via matrix theory .",
    "the challenge is to find the relevant degrees of freedom and to understand their behavior .",
    "if we are successful , we should be able to explain the black hole correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "we saw that the moduli of the internal torus act as chemical potentials , altering the balance of degrees of freedom in the equilibrium sym ensemble . at small @xmath58 ,",
    "membrane / antimembrane excitations dominate ; at small @xmath59 , fivebrane / antifivebrane excitations are more prominent . shrinking any circle of the torus to sub - planckian size , one will recover the matrix description of black holes as bound states of perturbative strings and d - branes .",
    "it is implicit in @xcite that the level density is @xmath98)$ ] in the perturbative string regime .",
    "the black hole level density is @xmath99 $ ] , so there will have to be a substantial crossover in the sym level density as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the correspondence principle is a statement that there are no phase transitions in this crossover region , so that the spectra of black holes and of string states match smoothly onto one another .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of this phenomenon occurs in matrix 1 + 1d sym on @xmath100 .",
    "the flux @xmath101 ( a momentum mode of the sym ) represents a longitudinally wrapped membrane . at large radius and",
    "far from extremality , the sym statistical mechanics describes a black string ; at small radius , an excited fundamental iia string emerges , stretched across the longitudinal direction .",
