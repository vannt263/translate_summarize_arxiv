    "the fundamental questions concerning the strong interaction and its understanding within quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) can be related to two basic issues , namely , confinement and the origin of mass .",
    "one goal of hadron physics is to understand the origin of hadron masses in the context of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "chiral symmetry , the fundamental symmetry of qcd for massless quarks , is broken on the hadron level .",
    "evidence for this phenomenon are hadrons which are candidates for parity doublets and , in a chirally symmetric world , should be mass degenerate .",
    "in reality , chiral partners like @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons or @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons bear quite different masses . in the case of nucleon resonances , an impressive example is the mass difference between the ground state ( 938  mev ) and the chiral partner , the s@xmath4(1535 ) resonance .    in the field of hadron physics ,",
    "experimental studies are performed with electromagnetic and hadronic probes and aim at the investigation of hadron properties and hadronic interactions .",
    "the study of in - medium properties of mesons and nucleon resonances carries the exciting promise to find signatures for partial chiral symmetry restoration at finite baryon density and temperature .",
    "nucleon resonances in the medium are subject to pauli - blocking of final states decreasing their width , collision broadening and broadening by the coupling to mesons with medium - modified properties . in experiments on total photoabsorption",
    "it is found that the second resonance bump , the excitation region above the @xmath5(1232 ) , resonance is completely suppressed for all nuclei from beryllium onward @xcite .",
    "this observation is intriguing .",
    "however , total photoabsorption does not provide information about the behavior of individual resonances .",
    "the second resonance region is composed of the overlapping states p@xmath4(1440 ) , d@xmath6(1520 ) , and s@xmath4(1535 ) . a significant in - medium modification of the d@xmath6(1520 ) is predicted due to the strong coupling to @xmath7 while only small effects are expected for the s@xmath4(1535 ) state @xcite .",
    "photoproduction of @xmath8 mesons in this energy range is dominated by the s@xmath4(1535 ) resonance @xcite , while single @xmath9 , double @xmath9 and @xmath10 photoproduction @xcite show a clear signal for the d@xmath6(1520 ) resonance .",
    "therefore , the reactions are well suited for the study of the in - medium properties of the respective resonances .",
    "photoproduction of @xmath8 mesons off nuclei had previously been studied up to 800  mev incident photon energy with taps at mami @xcite and for energies up to 1.1 gev at kek @xcite and tohoku @xcite .",
    "the first experiment did not observe an in - medium broadening of the resonance beyond effects from fermi smearing and @xmath8 final state interactions .",
    "the kek experiment reported some collision broadening of the resonance and the tohoku experiment indicated a significant contribution of a higher lying resonance to the @xmath11 reaction .",
    "however , the experiments do not cover the full line shape of the s@xmath4(1535 ) .",

    "they behave differently at higher incident photon energies where @xmath13 final states and secondary production mechanisms ( e.g. @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) contribute and obscure the s@xmath4 line shape .",
    "the contributions can almost completely be suppressed by cuts on the reaction kinematics .",
    "after these cuts , single @xmath8 photoproduction off heavy nuclei , like lead , becomes very similar to the fermi smeared average nucleon cross section .",

    "the excitation functions off the deuteron and off @xmath16ca have exactly the same shape so that there is no indication for an in - medium modification of the d@xmath6(1520 ) at energies below its peak position .",
    "however , the model of @xcite predicts the main effect for the high energy tail of the resonance .",
    "this part is covered by the preliminary data from the cbelsa / taps experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleonresonances ] , right hand side ) . here , a difference between deuteron and nuclear data is seen , in particular in the region of the valley between the second and third resonance bump .    a significant in - medium modification of the s@xmath4(1535 ) line shape is not observed . for the d@xmath6(1520 )",

    "further investigations could concentrate on the comparison with @xmath10 and @xmath18 pion pairs which can stem from an in - medium @xmath2 meson while the decay of @xmath2 into @xmath17 is forbidden .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the mass split between the @xmath19=0@xmath20 pion and the @xmath19=0@xmath21 @xmath1-meson .",
    "the naive assumption that the two masses should become degenerate in the chiral limit is supported by model calculations @xcite . however , the very nature of the @xmath1 meson is a matter of debate .",
    "the review of particle properties @xcite lists the @xmath22(600 ) with a mass range from 400 - 1200  mev and a full width between 600  mev and 1000  mev .",
    "recently , predictions for mass and width from dispersion relations have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 meson is treated as a pure @xmath23 ( quasi)bound state @xcite , and as a correlated @xmath24 pair in a @xmath25 , @xmath26 state @xcite . in all cases , a strong coupling to scalar - isoscalar pion pairs and a significant in - medium modification of the invariant mass distribution of the pion pairs",
    "is predicted .",
    "this is either due to the in - medium spectral function of the @xmath1 meson @xcite or the in - medium modification of the pion - pion interaction @xcite due to coupling to nucleon - hole , @xmath5 - hole and @xmath27 - hole states .",
    "the predicted effect is a downward shift of the strength in the invariant mass distributions of scalar , isoscalar pion pairs in nuclear matter .",
    "first experimental evidence had been reported by the chaos collaboration from the measurement of pion induced double pion production reactions @xcite .",
    "the main finding was a buildup of strength with rising mass number at low invariant masses for the @xmath18 final state .",
    "the effect was not observed for the @xmath28 channel where the @xmath1 meson can not contribute .",
    "a similar effect was found by the crystal ball collaboration at bnl . here ,",
    "an enhancement of strength at low masses was observed for heavy nuclei in the @xmath29 reaction @xcite . in photon",
    "induced reactions , pions can be produced in the entire volume of the nuclei but final state interactions suppress the contributions from the deep interior of the nuclei .",
    "final state interactions can be minimized by the use of low incident photon energies , giving rise to low energy pions which have much larger mean free paths than pions that can excite the @xmath5-resonance @xcite .",
    "photoproduction of the different charge states of pions from the free proton and the quasifree neutron has previously been studied in detail with the daphne @xcite and taps detectors @xcite at mami - b in mainz from threshold to the second resonance region , and for the @xmath17 channel at higher incident photon energies at graal in grenoble @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "first results from a measurement of @xmath17 and @xmath10 photoproduction off carbon and lead have been reported in @xcite .",

    "@xcite , more experimental detail and the results of an additional measurement of double pion photoproduction off calcium nuclei are presented and compared to model calculations .",
    "the invariant mass spectra show a similar effect as already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for carbon and lead nuclei , namely a softening of the @xmath17 distributions relative to the @xmath10 distributions .",
    "the strength of the effect is comparable to that from carbon .",
    "the data have been compared to calculations in the framework of the buu model @xcite .",
    "a sizable part of the in - medium effects can be explained by the model by final state interaction effects which tend to shift rescattered pions to smaller kinetic energies . only for the lowest incident photon energies a small additional downward shift of the strength to small invariant masses for the @xmath17 channel may be visible .",
    "decisive results will come from a recently completed experimental run @xcite with the 4@xmath0 detector combination crystal ball and taps at mami - b . here",
    ", superior statistics has been accumulated for carbon , calcium , and lead targets .",
    "in - medium modifications of vector mesons have been searched for via the spectroscopy of dilepton pairs in heavy ion reactions by the ceres experiment @xcite and more recently the na60 collaboration @xcite which reported an in - medium broadening of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "in - medium modifications of @xmath2 and @xmath30 mesons were reported from 12 gev p+a reactions at kek @xcite . here , the authors find that the mass spectra are well reproduced by a model that takes into account the density dependence of the vector meson mass modification . in contradiction to these results , the photon induced dilepton experiment g7 with clas at jefferson lab",
    "concludes that the masses are consistent with the pdg values and the widths are consistent with the collisional broadening @xcite .",
    "the results do not show a doubling of the @xmath2 width reported by na60 and do not favor the predicted mass shifts of 16 - 20% .",
    "this controversy will have to be addressed in the near future .",
    "finally , a modification of the @xmath31 meson has been suggested on the basis of the @xmath32-dependence of the photoproduction yields @xcite .",
    "the cbelsa / taps @xcite experiment measured the line shape of the @xmath33 invariant mass peak from the free proton and from nuclei",
    ". the measured invariant mass peaks of the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 decays were identical for hydrogen and the nuclear targets . only in case of the @xmath30 , a low energy shoulder of the peak was found for nuclei and is shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : prl-94 - 192303-fig3 ] .",
