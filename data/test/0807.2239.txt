    "the central parsec of our galaxy harbors different groups of young stars orbiting the central smbh .",
    "these include one or two stellar disks at @xmath0pc from sgr a@xmath1 made up of 56myr old stars @xcite , and a number of stars on highly eccentric orbits even closer , the so - called s stars @xcite . with orbital periods as small as 15 years , the s stars provide powerful constraints on the mass and size of the central dark object @xcite .",
    "while the origin of the stellar disk(s ) observed in the galactic center can be understood @xcite , the s stars show a puzzling combination of interesting features @xcite : they are very young ( @xmath2myr ) , with less than 0.01pc a factor of 10 closer to the smbh than the closest young population known ( the stellar disks ) , and move around sgr a@xmath1 on randomly oriented eccentric orbits .    a number of mechanisms to create the s stars have been proposed , but so far none of them was able to account for all their properties ( see also review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : it has been suggested that the s stars are not young but rejuvenated stars or exotic objects , but this is in conflict with their spectral properties , showing they are ordinary main - sequence b - type stars @xcite . in situ formation is excluded by the inexplicably high pressure required to overcome the strong tidal forces , and will also lead to a stellar disk @xcite , which can not account for the random orientation and high eccentricity of the orbits within the stars lifetime @xcite .",
    "the latter argument also argues against the suggested scenario of an infalling cluster of young stars @xcite , which would moreover require a very high mass @xcite , or an intermediate - mass black hole in its center for it to survive the tidal force of sgr a@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "exchange capture with compact remnants @xcite only works with a large cluster of black holes and fails to explain the youth and high initial eccentricities .",
    "the lense - thirring effect may account for the innermost star @xcite , s2 , being dragged out of the disk plane , but can not explain the orbital orientation of the longer - period s stars , nor the proximity of the orbit itself .",
    "interaction of stars in a central cluster with a fossil accretion disk can lead to high eccentricities and orbital decay @xcite if the disk mass is sufficiently high , but fails to explain the observed bias toward young b - type stars .",
    "furthermore , such an accretion disk is expected to fragment and form stars and should thus have been observed .    tidal disruption of binaries falling into the galactic center on highly eccentric orbits has been shown to be an effective mechanism to create s stars , but until now required very massive star clusters passing close to sgr a@xmath1 @xcite or the presence of a large enough population of compact massive perturbers in combination with many young stars on eccentric orbits @xcite .    in the following",
    "we show how the dynamical interaction of two stellar disks at larger radii , as they are observed in the galactic center , naturally leads to the creation of s stars .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the setup of our numerical simulations . in   [ sec : high - ecc ] , we present the outcome of these simulations , showing how the disk stars can eventually gain very high eccentricities .",
    "section [ sec : disrupt ] explains how binary stars on such eccentric orbits around the smbh get disrupted , leaving behind an s star and possibly a hypervelocity star . in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss our results , showing how the mechanism suggested here explains all the observed properties of the s stars .",
    "an extensive analysis of young massive stars in the innermost parsec of our galaxy shows that almost all stars reside in two @xmath3myr old rotating disks  except for the s stars in the central arcsecond @xcite . while the clockwise disk is very distinct",
    ", there is some debate over the disk structure of the counterclockwise system @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that a single stellar disk can not explain the high inclinations and eccentricities observed . using direct @xmath4-body calculations",
    "as described below , we find that the distribution of eccentricities and inclinations of the observed young stars orbits is consistent with an initial configuration of two relatively flat disks , since the less massive disk is destroyed over time due to dynamical interaction ( see   [ sec : high - ecc ] ) .    to investigate the stellar dynamical evolution of two interacting stellar disks , we have computed a number of @xmath4-body integrations .",
    "the parameters of our model are chosen so as to best fit the observations by @xcite and are as follows : our model consists of a @xmath5 smbh and two flat circular stellar disks , mutually inclined at an angle of @xmath6 , with a surface density profile that scales with distance as @xmath7 .",
    "the disks have well - defined initial extents of @xmath8pc and @xmath9pc , respectively .",
    "we assume that the lower mass limit of the stars observed by @xcite is @xmath10 . for our models ,",
    "we assume a disk age of 5myr , and hence an upper initial mass limit of @xmath11 for the observed disk stars @xcite . using the initial mass function @xmath12",
    "as derived from the @xmath13-band luminosity function by @xcite with mass limits 1 and 120@xmath14 , this leads to a total initial stellar mass of @xmath15 to explain the 73 observed o stars . allowing for 30% binaries and another 10% for stars disrupted by the smbh or unobserved , and using a mass ratio of 2:1 for the disks , we have initial stellar masses of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . as a consequence",
    ", our disks initially consist of 535 and 267 multimass stars ( and binaries ) , respectively .",
    "the above parameters have proven to result in a distribution of eccentricities and semimajor axes as well as an inclination between the two disks after 5 myr which best match the observations .",
    "we used our bhint code @xcite for the integration , which has been developed specifically to calculate the dynamics of stars orbiting a smbh , and includes post - newtonian treatment up to order 2.5 to account for the effects of general relativity .",
    "furthermore , we have added the sse package by @xcite to account for the effects of stellar mass loss .",
    "the stars and binaries are modeled as point masses , and all binaries are assumed to be equal - mass .",
    "tidal disruption is not considered ; however , we assume that stars on very tight orbits ( @xmath18au ) are swallowed by the smbh .",
    "we switch on the post - newtonian terms for the central motion around the smbh in our bhint integrator @xcite for eccentricities @xmath19 , and switch it off when @xmath20 falls below 0.8 .",
    "a fully post - newtonian calculation shows that in the regime considered in this letter , relativistic effects are negligible for orbits with lower eccentricities within the considered timescale .",
    "we finally note that the detailed choice of parameters seems not to be too important . a number of models with variations in total mass , mass function , and disk age lead to comparable results .",
    "due to mutual torques , the two stellar disks described above precess about each other , with a frequency proportional to the other disk s mass : the precession frequency of a star orbiting a smbh of mass @xmath21 at radius @xmath22 at an inclination @xmath23 relative to a narrow disk of mass @xmath24 at a radius @xmath25 can be approximated as @xcite @xmath26    as can be seen , the precession frequency depends also on the distance of a star from the central smbh @xcite , and since both disks have a finite extent , stars at different central distances precess with different frequencies , thus warping the originally flat disks .",
    "in particular , the innermost stars quickly get inclined with respect to their disk of origin , and so start precessing about both disks .",
    "this leads to further thickening and deformation of the disks as well as large inclinations .",
    "figure [ fig : discevol1 ] depicts the evolution of the stellar disks shape and thickness .",
    "being exposed to the larger torque , the less massive disk is warped much faster , explaining why the observed thickness of the less massive disk in the center of our galaxy is substantially higher , making its present existence controversial @xcite .",
    "apart from precession , all stars are subject to the kozai mechanism @xcite : stars on highly inclined orbits relative to an axisymmetric perturbation periodically obtain small inclinations , and simultaneously gain high eccentricities . at their pericenter , stars on orbits with eccentricity",
    "@xmath27 pass the central smbh within @xmath28au , less than the s stars pericenter distances .",
    "the effects of general relativity causes eccentric orbits to precess , which may damp the kozai mechanism and prevent further growth in eccentricity @xcite .",
    "however , our simulations show that in the presence of very massive , nearby disks , relativistic effects do not prevent eccentricities as high as @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : eccent ] shows the eccentricity evolution of some stars in our simulation , and the total fraction of stars that have reached eccentric orbits within a given time .",
    "a significant fraction of the stars obtain very high eccentricities .",
    "in contrast , a single stellar disk around a smbh evolves only very slowly : in a corresponding integration , no star obtained an orbital eccentricity above 0.8 within a comparable time span .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of an external torque , and the lack of large inclinations required for the kozai mechanism to become effective .",
    "as most stars form in binaries @xcite , it is natural to assume that a significant fraction of stars in the stellar disks are followed by a companion .",
    "the orbits of these binaries around the smbh are subject to the same kozai mechanism as single stars , but a very close pericenter passage may break up the binary and leave one star on a tightly bound orbit around the smbh .    in a set of three - body integrations of a stellar binary orbiting a smbh , we have investigated the distribution of binary disruption remnants .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : eccent ] , the eccentricity evolution due to the kozai effect is smooth .",
    "we calculated a set of models including a smbh , an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) to drive the kozai , and a stellar binary on an initially circular orbit at high inclination with respect to the imbh s orbit in order to test the impact of a kozai oscillation on the binary s inner orbital parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : binkozai ] shows the time evolution of a 0.1au binary s both outer and inner eccentricity and semimajor axis .",
    "it can be seen that until binary disruption , only the outer eccentricity is changing . in particular , the binary does not widen . only during the last few pericenter passages does the inner eccentricity grow to a value of @xmath30 , but this does not significantly change the resulting semimajor axis of the bound member , nor the velocity of the ejected star . computations with wider binaries ( 1au ) yield similar results .",
    "we thus conclude that any tight binary undergoing kozai resonance reaches its point of disruption basically unperturbed .",
    "we have therefore computed a set of models where the pericenter distance of a binary orbiting a smbh is equal to the disruption distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disrupt ] ) .",
    "we find that the disruption remnants of binaries with separations larger than a few au orbit the central smbh on similar trajectories as the initial binary , and so can still be observed as disk stars .",
    "however , the disruption of a tight binary ( with separation of 1au or less ) forces one star onto a very tight and eccentric s - star - type orbit , while the other star gains a significant amount of energy and may even be ejected from the galaxy , thus becoming a progenitor of the hypervelocity stars observed in the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , disruption of binaries with a separation of 0.2au leaves one star on an orbit with semimajor axis consistent with those of the observed s stars , while the other star is ejected from the galaxy with a velocity of up to 1000kms@xmath31 in more than half of our integrations .",
    "binary disruption has been shown to be an effective mechanism to create the s stars @xcite .",
    "one way to create young close - passage binaries is by massive perturbers like star clusters or molecular clouds at distances of a few pc from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that these binaries are also a natural consequence of the interaction of the two stellar disks : using a binary fraction of 30% , 18 of the b - type binaries achieve pericenter distances below their tidal radius , assuming a binary separation of 0.1au .",
    "given that not much is known about the binary fraction in the galactic center , this is fully consistent with the observed number of 15 s stars .",
    "the mechanism described above naturally explains the reported mysteries of the s stars : the disruption of stellar binaries as tight as 0.11au can leave a single star orbiting the central smbh a factor of 10 closer than the original binary .",
    "this is just the distance ratio of s stars and stellar disks observed in the center of our galaxy .",
    "the orientation of the disks rapidly changes due to precession .",
    "furthermore , the change of orientation of a binary s orbit is a natural consequence of the kozai effect . once a binary is disrupted and leaves a single star on a much closer orbit , this orbit is decoupled from the originating stellar disk s motion , as both the precession frequency and the kozai oscillation period are functions of central distance , explaining the widely varying orbital orientations observed .",
    "the eccentricities created for the tightly bound stars after tidal disruption are as high as 0.99 .",
    "resonant relaxation @xcite and kozai interactions between the s stars are expected to turn these extremely high eccentricities into an isotropic distribution on a short timescale , just as is observed for the s stars .    while all of the s stars observed so far are main - sequence b - type stars , observations of the stellar disks in the galactic center mostly revealed ob giants and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "but even for the unusually flat mass function suggested @xcite , one would expect a factor of 5 more b - type main - sequence stars in the disks than o stars .",
    "most of these stars have not been observed yet , mainly due to crowding of the observed region , limited spatial resolution , and strong nebular emission @xcite .",
    "our computation assuming equal - mass binaries predicts only one s star above 20@xmath14 per 18 b - type s stars .",
    "the lack of observed o - type s stars is therefore not statistically significant .",
    "the number of expected massive s stars would drop further for random pairing of binary component masses , since disruption of a high mass ratio binary will only moderately change the orbit of the massive member .",
    "furthermore , the massive o stars might not form in as tight binaries as are required to produce s stars . hence , it is legitimate to assume that both s stars and disk stars formed in the same environment , thus providing a solution to the `` paradox of youth '' .    in this letter",
    ", we studied the evolution of two isolated stellar disks orbiting a smbh . in a forthcoming publication",
    ", we will analyze the effects of other contributions of a perturbing potential , such as a stellar cusp ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a massive circumnuclear disk @xcite , an intermediate - mass black hole and/or a star cluster ( probably irs 13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "preliminary results indicate , e.g. , that the presence of a cusp of stellar black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not prevent the dynamical formation of s stars as described in this letter .",
