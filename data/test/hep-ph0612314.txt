    "the last few years witnessed a renewed interest in hadronic physics , originated in part by many new findings in hadron spectroscopy , the most conspicuous being the narrow pentaquark states reported by more than ten independent experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "the narrow state predicted by a chiral soliton model  @xcite provided the initial motivation for the search of the @xmath14 pentaquark and its possible partners .",
    "after the reports of null results started to accumulate  @xcite the initial optimism declined , and the experimental situation remains ambiguous to the present .",
    "the increase in statistics led to some recent new claims for positive evidence  @xcite , while the null result  @xcite by clas is specially significant because it contradicts their earlier positive result  @xcite , suggesting that at least in their case the original claim was an artifact due to low statistics .",
    "all this experimental activity spurred a great amount of theoretical work in all kinds of models for hadrons and a renewed interest in soliton models .",
    "there is a great amount of uncertainty in model calculations that could be reduced with more experimental input , like the spin and parity of the reported exotic states  @xcite or the possible existence of spin - flavor partners  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations are constantly improving but the situation also remains ambiguous  @xcite , in part by the extrapolations to light masses and the difficulty to disentangle scattering states from bound states in a finite volume . given the difficulties still faced by first principle qcd calculations , the @xmath6 expansion  @xcite of qcd , where @xmath2 is the number of colors , provides a very useful analytical tool ( for a recent account see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , and relates the chiral soliton model to the more intuitive quark model picture  @xcite , where the pentaquark correspond to states with quark content @xmath15 .    in the large @xmath2 limit , qcd has a contracted spin - flavor symmetry @xmath16  @xcite in the baryon sector , also known as @xmath17-symmetry , that constrains their mass spectrum and couplings .",
    "the breaking of the spin - flavor symmetry can be studied systematically in an @xmath6 expansion .",
    "this approach has been applied to the ground - state @xmath18 $ ] baryons @xcite , and to their orbital excitations  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath2 expansion has also been applied to hybrid baryons @xcite and more recently to exotic baryons containing both quarks and antiquarks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume the existence of these exotic states , and investigate their properties in the case that they have positive parity .",
    "a partial subset of these states were considered in the @xmath6 expansion in ref .",
    "negative parity exotic states have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "a brief report of some results presented here has been given in  @xcite .",
    "we start by constructing the color singlet @xmath0 states by coupling the spin - flavor , orbital and color degrees of freedom , all constrained by fermi statistics .",
    "the light exotic states we obtain are members of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 irreducible representations of the contracted spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "this extends the analysis of @xcite , which considered only the first irreducible representation .",
    "similar states with one heavy antiquark exist , that can be labelled in the large @xmath2 limit by the conserved quantum number @xmath21 associated with the light degrees of freedom . in our case of the positive parity pentaquarks ,",
    "there is only one tower with @xmath22 , containing all nonstrange states for which the isospin @xmath23 and spin of the light degrees of freedom @xmath24 satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "an important difference with respect to the treatment of the strong decay amplitudes done in ref .",
    "@xcite is that we will keep the orbital angular momentum explicit in the transition operator , which is required to get the correct @xmath2 scaling of the relevant couplings .",
    "although the existence of pentaquarks is not yet established or completely ruled out by experiments , one thing that seems to be fairly well established is that if they exist they should be narrow , with a width of @xmath26 , otherwise they would have been observed long before  @xcite .",
    "explanations for the uncanny narrow width vary .",
    "cancellations between coupling constants have been invoked in the context of the original chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "this cancellation has been argued to be exact in the large @xmath2 limit @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed comparison of different versions of the chiral soliton model suggests that there is only one coupling constant to leading order and this cancellation can not take place @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued @xcite that heavy pentaquark states @xmath27 should be narrow in the combined @xmath28 and @xmath6 limit . unfortunately , the experimental situation for the heavy pentaquark states @xmath27 is also inconclusive .",
    "the charmed pentaquark initially reported by the h1 collaboration @xcite has not yet been confirmed @xcite .",
    "we agree with the conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite about the existence of a single operator mediating @xmath29 transitions at leading order , but we find an overall suppression factor of @xmath30 .",
    "this gives the @xmath2 scaling of the strong widths @xmath31 for the positive parity pentaquarks .",
    "the corresponding pion widths among different @xmath32 states scale like @xmath33 if the transition @xmath34 is allowed by phase space",
    ". any states for which the pion modes are not allowed , which include the lowest lying pentaquark , are thus predicted to be narrow in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we construct the complete set of the positive parity pentaquarks and give their tower structure in the large @xmath2 limit . in sec .",
