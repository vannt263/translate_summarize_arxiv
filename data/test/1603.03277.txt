    "metal  insulator transitions ( mit s ) are intensively studied starting from the 1940s until now @xcite .",
    "however , the quantitative description of the mit s and sometimes the qualitative understanding of the physical phenomena determining these transitions in definite systems still remain unsatisfactory @xcite .    mit investigation within the hubbard model clarifies that electron correlations cause a gap formation in the electron paramagnetic spectrum , which leads to the metal ",
    "insulator transition at half - filling at finite values of the coulomb interaction constant @xmath2 @xcite ( mott scenario ) .",
    "later , the description of such a transition was improved by the use of the many - electron x - operator approach @xcite and within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , which predicts a first - order mit @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a strong tendency to antiferromagnetism is characteristic for the half - filled band , so that the magnetic ( slater ) scenario of mit should be considered besides the mott scenario .",
    "experimentally the magnetic scenario of mit is observed in v@xmath3o@xmath4 and nis@xmath5se@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the account of the nearest - neighbor electron hopping only ( with the transfer integral @xmath0 ) for the bipartite lattices results in exponentially small dielectric gap of the slater type ( antiferromagnetic subbands ) appearing at any weak interaction @xmath2 between electrons , manifesting the formation of insulating state .",
    "when the next - nearest - neighbor hopping is taken into account ( with the transfer integral @xmath1 ) the antiferromagnetic ( af ) metal  insulator transition occurs at a finite interaction . in the case of small @xmath1",
    "the first - order mit occurs with the transition point determined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density of states on the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the dmft studies of the af state confirm the first - order transition at small @xmath1 but predict the second - order transition for large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for very large @xmath9 the af state on the bethe lattice was shown to be strongly suppressed so that the paramagnetic mit emerges from the magnetic region  @xcite .",
    "usually mit is studied taking into account only the checkerboard af ordering , being usually assumed to dominate near half - filling .",
