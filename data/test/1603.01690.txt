    "turbulent convection is one of the major uncertainties in our understanding of stellar properties . as a very efficient mixing process and energy transfer mechanism",
    ", it affects the stellar structure and evolution significantly . because of its high non - linearity and complexity",
    ", we can not solve the turbulent flows analytically at present .",
    "since @xcite established the first practical model of stellar structure , a lot of effort has been made to study the problems of stellar convection .",
    "a traditional treatment is the mixing - length theory ( mlt)(@xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea of mlt is that convection is viewed as rising and sinking bubbles which blend into the surroundings after traveling a distance of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath3 is the local pressure scale height .",
    "since the 1960 s , several authors have worked directly with the hydrodynamic equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) . by far , besides the various mlts , the most practical stellar convection theories are those based on the moment method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the moment approach was introduced first by @xcite and its first application in stellar convection was discussed by castor ( 1968 , unpublished , see the review by @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "the flow variables are split into an average and a fluctuating part .",
    "manipulation of the hydrodynamic equations based on such splitting gives a set of equations for the moments of the turbulent fluctuations . in these equations ,",
    "higher order moments appear and need to be approximated by the so - called closure models .",
    "most of these models use a gradient type approximation , e.g. xiong s theory . along with the development of digital computer and computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) ,",
    "numerical simulations have become an essential tool for the astrophysical fluid dynamic community .",
    "the pioneer work in the numerical study of stellar type convection is the two - dimensional simulations of compressible convection done by @xcite . since the late 1980 s ,",
    "three - dimensional numerical experiments and simulations have become the mainstream ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical investigation of turbulent flows has two categories : direct numerical simulation ( dns ) and large eddy simulation ( les ) .",
    "the problem being three - dimensional , multi - length - scale and multi - time - scale , a dns of stellar convection demands enormous computer resources . in les ,",
    "the large eddies are calculated explicitly while the smaller eddies are to be handled by sub - grid scale ( sgs ) models .",
    "this is usually the approach adopted for stellar flow simulations .",
    "being limited by the speed and memory of the computers , the progresses made by numerical simulations are usually slow .",
    "even with today s machines , we still can not simulate directly the whole convection zone of a post - main - sequence star .",
    "a frequently used approach is to make high resolution local simulation .",
    "many problems of stellar structure are associated with convective overshooting .",
    "the overshooting distance beneath an outer convection zone may affect the surface chemical composition , e.g. , the depletion of lithium in the sun .",
    "the radiative - convective boundary is thought to be closely related to the solar dynamo and is the site for magnetic flux storage .",
    "the gravity waves generated by penetration may generate momentum exchange with the interior .",
    "however , calculation of overshooting is a challenge to all existing stellar convection theories . due to its intrinsic drawback",
    ", the local mlt can not handle the convective overshooting consistently .",
    "a number of non - local models have been developed to incorporate the feedback of the overshooting on the energy transport in the penetration zone which is neglected in the local mlt .",
    "although these models can produce overshooting , they still consider convection as an extended local phenomenon ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in xiong s",
    "hydrodynamic stellar convection theory ( 1985b,1989b ) , the difficulties caused by local treatment disappear spontaneously .",
    "xiong s calculations show extensive overshooting zones and the kinetic energy fluxes in such zones are negligible . at the same time",
    ", the impact on the overall stellar structure is minor ( especially for zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) stars ) .",
    "however , xiong s closure scheme is under debate .",
    "numerical experiments can be used to test the assumptions used in the one - dimensional models .",
    "@xcite performed a two - dimensional simulation of convective penetration to study the integral constraints on the extent of overshooting by constructing a temperature - dependent radiation conductivity model . @xcite conducted a series of numerical experiments to examine the scaling relationships among the penetration distance ( @xmath4 ) , vertical velocity at the bottom of the convective region and the total energy flux ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the results of three - dimensional less of compressible turbulent convection were used to test the relations proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they confirmed @xmath6 for nearly adiabatic penetration and @xmath7 for non - adiabatic penetration where @xmath8 is the root mean square ( rms ) vertical velocity at the unstable - stable interface . using the same technique",
    ", @xcite found that the numerical aspects of the model , such as aspect ratio , grid number could greatly affect the penetrative distance .",
    "@xcite performed a large number of high - resolution , three - dimensional dnss for the purpose of investigating the penetration and overshooting of the turbulent compressible convection . in their study , the effects of rotation were included .",
    "recently , penetration below a stellar type rotating convection zone were estimated by @xcite with a set of less .",
    "@xcite reported a two - dimensional simulation of gravity waves induced by overshooting below the solar convection zone . in these numerical experiments , only ideal gas with a polytropic initial distribution was considered .",
    "however , for a practical model , the realistic radiation opacity and the equation of state(eos ) should be used .    according to the stellar evolution theory , at the base of the giants branch in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ,",
    "convection occurs in the outer region of the envelope and extends to the deep stellar interior .",
    "when the base of the convection zone overlaps with the exhausted nuclear reaction area , the turbulent convection will produce an efficient mixing and dredge up the processed material to the surface of star .",
    "this mechanism is used to explain observed surface chemical peculiarities at the surfaces of certain stars . in this paper",
    ", we present a preliminary attempt to simulate overshooting below the convective envelopes of some post - main - sequence stars .",
    "besides the eos and the radiation opacity ( modified to accomodate an enhanced flux ) , the radiative pressure , radiative energy were also taken into account . in section 2 , a brief introduction to the adopted hydrodynamic code and input physics is given .",
    "the construction of the initial hydrostatic models , the simplifications and the parameters of the computational models are also specified there . in section 3",
    "we analyze the numerical results with a focus on the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations , energy fluxes , overshooting , and moment closure .",
    "a summary will be given in the section 4 where the limitation and extensibility of the current study are also discussed .",
    "for simplicity , the magnetic field , rotation and nuclear reaction are neglected .",

    "( [ mu ] ) is fixed at @xmath36 . near the solid boundaries ,",

    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are the radial location of the bottom and the height of the computational domain , respectively ( see section 2.3 ) .",

    "the aspect ratio of the domain ( width / height ) is @xmath45 . the total energy flux @xmath46 is fixed at the bottom ; at the top the entropy is fixed .",
    "the grid distribution is horizontally uniform . in vertical direction ,",
    "the grid spacing decreases smoothly with the height .",
    "all cases use a @xmath47 mesh .",
    "we adopted the adism ( alternating direction implicit method on staggered mesh ) scheme of @xcite to solve the full ns equations ( [ ns1])@xmath37([ns3 ] ) .",
    "this method has second - order - accuracy in space which is adequate for simulating the turbulent situation . as an implicit scheme",
    ", it can avoid the time step restriction imposed by sound waves associated with the courant - friedriches - lewy(cfl ) condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "numerical tests show that the adism scheme can maintain stability for a time - step over 100 times the normal value suitable for explicit schemes .",
    "in contrast with most other implicit methods , the cpu time consumption of the adi method is linearly proportional to the number of grid points .",
    "a detailed examination of the adism approach has been given by @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic code we used was initially developed and used by @xcite and then adopted by @xcite to study the upper solar transition layer .",
    "therefore , it has been well debugged .      in the simulated region ,",
    "the temperature is high enough that all kinds of atoms are fully ionized . for a density @xmath10 and a gas particle mass @xmath48 ,",
    "the coulomb energy per particle is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the particle charge , @xmath51 is the permittivity , @xmath52 is the mean inter - particle distance , @xmath53 is the atomic mass unit . at temperature @xmath54",
    ", the kinetic energy per particle has the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the ratio of coulomb energy to kinetic energy can be estimated as @xmath57 \\frac{\\rho^{1/3}}{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are of the order of unit , the term in square brackets is approximately @xmath60 . for our modeled cases , the ratio of @xmath61 is less than @xmath62 , which means @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that the particle interactions are dominated by collisions and the nonideal effects caused by the coulomb force can be safely neglected .",
    "hence , for the present calculation , the gas is treated as a fully ionized ideal gas .",
    "the internal energy @xmath15 and total pressure @xmath12 can be expressed as : @xmath64 respectively , where @xmath65 is the gas pressure , @xmath66 is the radiation pressure , and @xmath67 is the ionization energy per mass unit . using eqs .",
    "( [ eos ] ) we can conveniently calculate thermodynamic variables such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath68 , etc .",
    "comparisons show that the discrepancies between the @xmath10 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 calculated by equation ( [ eos ] ) and the interpolation from the opal eos tables ( @xcite ) are less than @xmath69 in the regions we computed .",

    "the overshoot extents from present study are comparable to the local pressure scale heights and well scaled by @xmath74 .",
    "the scaling relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is acceptable except for case i3 .",
    "this may be due to the more serious influence of radiation diffusion in i3 ( the peclet number gets smaller ) . from the last two columns of table  [ ovsh ] ,",
    "one may infer a scaling @xmath77 which is not consistent with @xmath78 given in section  [ sec : fluc ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath79 works better than @xmath78 in the lower overshooting zone .",
    "if we use the scaling relation @xmath80 to calculate the overshooting distance for @xmath81 , the resulted value would be very small .",
    "however , the last column of table  [ ovsh ] shows that the ratio @xmath82 increases as @xmath46 decreases .",
    "consequently , it is possible that the overshooting distance is still substantial when @xmath83 is close to be the realistic value .",

    "numerical simulations and xiong s one - dimensional stellar convection theory generally give overshoot extents comparable to the local @xmath3 .",
    "however , heiloseismological inference gives a small overshoot extent , e.g. , @xmath85(@xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out in xd2001 , the discrepancy may be caused by the assumption of a break in the radial derivative of the sound speed .",
    "the break is a consequence of the local mlt and does not appear in xiong s theory .",

    "<S> an attempt at understanding the downward overshooting in the convective envelopes of the post - main - sequence stars has been made on the basis of three - dimensional large eddy simulations , using artificially modified opal opacity and taking into account radiation and ionization in the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> two types of stars , an intermediate mass star and a massive star were considered . to avoid the long thermal relaxation time of the intermediate mass star </S>",
    "<S> , we increased the stellar energy flux artificially while trying to maintain a structure close to the one given by one - dimensional stellar model . </S>",
    "<S> a parametric study of the flux factor was performed . for the massive star , </S>",
    "<S> no such manner was necessary . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results were analyzed when the system reached the statistical steady state . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the penetration distance in pressure scale heights is of the order of unit . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling relations among the penetration distance , input flux and vertical velocity fluctuations studied by singh et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) were checked . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the turbulent convection and the diffusion models of third order moments representing the non - local transports were also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> these models are dramatically affected by the velocity fields and no universal constant parameters seem to exist . </S>",
    "<S> the limitation of the numerical results was discussed as well .    </S>",
