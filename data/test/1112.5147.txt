    "the systems involving heavy quarks decays are important frameworks to restrict the standard model ( sm ) parameters as well as search for new physics effects .",
    "especially , the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transition of @xmath4 , which is underlying transition of @xmath2 decay at the quark level , is known to be sensitive to new physics effects .",
    "this process can also be used in exact determination of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 as elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and answering some fundamental questions such as cp violation .    in the last decade ,",
    "important experimental progress has been made in identification and spectroscopy of the heavy baryons with single heavy quark @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the lhc will open new horizons not only in the identification and spectroscopy of these baryons , but also it will provide possibility to study the weak , strong and electromagnetic decays of heavy baryons .    in accordance with this experimental progress",
    ", there is an increasing interest on calculation of parameters of the heavy baryons and investigation of their decay modes theoretically .",
    "the masses of these baryons have been calculated using various methods such as quark models @xcite , heavy quark effective theory @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite . besides the mass spectrum ,",
    "their weak , strong and electromagnetic decays have also received special attention , recently ( for instance see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the semileptonic @xmath7 transition in the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "the main ingredients in analysis of this channel are form factors entering the transition matrix elements . using the most general form of the interpolating field for the @xmath1 heavy baryon as well as the distribution amplitudes ( da s ) of the light @xmath0 baryon",
    ", we first calculate all twelve form factors in full theory .",
    "then , we use these form factors to calculate the total decay rate as well as the branching ratio of the considered decay channel .",
    "the paper is organized in three sections . in the next section ,",
    "we obtain qcd sum rules for the form factors . in section 3 ,",
    "we numerically analyze the form factors and use them to calculate the related decay rate and branching fraction .",
    "in this section , we focus on the calculation of the form factors corresponding to @xmath7 semileptonic decay which proceeds via @xmath8 transition at quark level . the effective hamiltonian describing this transition",
    "is written as : @xmath9 the amplitude of the transition can be obtained by sandwiching the effective hamiltonian between the initial and final states , @xmath10 from this equation , it is obvious that the transition matrix elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 are required .",
    "these matrix elements are expressed in terms of twelve form factors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 running from 1 to 3 ) as follows : @xmath18 u_{\\sigma_{b}}(p+q)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 u_{\\sigma_{b}}(p+q)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spinors of @xmath1 and @xmath0 baryons , respectively , and @xmath22 denotes transferred momentum .",
    "our main task is to calculate the aforesaid transition form factors . in accordance with the philosophy of qcd sum rules ,",
    "we start considering the following correlation functions : @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for interpolating current of @xmath1 .",
    "the interpolating current should be chosen as a composite operator that has the same quantum numbers as the baryon under study .",
    "for @xmath1 baryon , there are two possible choices for such a current that does not contain any derivatives or auxiliary four vectors .",
    "the most general form for the interpolating current is a superposition of these two choices .",

    "the correlation function can be calculated both in terms of the hadronic parameters , such as the form factors , and also in terms of the qcd parameters .",
    "the expression in terms of the qcd parameters is evaluated by expanding the time ordered product of the currents in terms of the @xmath0 distribution amplitudes via operator product expansion ( ope ) in deep euclidean region . on the other hand ,",

    "our calculations show that their contribution constitutes only few percent of the final results , so we neglect their contribution in the present work .",
    "besides these input parameters , there appear also three auxiliary parameters in the sum rules , i.e. borel mass parameter @xmath72 , continuum threshold @xmath73 , and the general parameter @xmath27 arising in the interpolating current of the @xmath1 baryon .",
    "these parameters should not effect the values of the form factors , so one should obtain working regions of them for which the form factors show weak dependence on these parameters .    lowering the value of the borel mass increases the contribution of the higher twist da s , hence requiring that the twist expansion converges leads to a lower limit on the borel mass ; on the other hand , increasing the value of the borel mass increases the contribution of the higher states and the continuum . hence requiring that the contribution of the higher states and continuum to the correlation function is less than half the total contribution yields an upper bound on the borel mass . both of these conditions are met if the borel mass is chosen in the interval @xmath74 .",
    "the continuum threshold @xmath73 is not totally arbitrary but it is correlated to the energy of the first excited state .",
    "our analysis shows that in the region @xmath75 , the dependences of the form factors on this parameter are weak . finally , to find the working region of @xmath27 , the dependence of the form factors on @xmath76 in the interval @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is considered .",
    "our numerical calculations lead to the working region , @xmath79 .    as an example , in fig . 1 , we depict the dependences of the form factor @xmath80 on auxiliary parameters as well as @xmath81 . fig .",

    "our predictions change by approximately @xmath85 . from these two figures",
    ", it is also seen that our predictions are almost independent of the continuum threshold . finally , in fig ( 1c )",
    ", we show the dependence of the form factor @xmath86 on @xmath81 at two fixed values of @xmath27 , and @xmath83 and @xmath87 .",
    "the sum rules predictions are only reliable for the region @xmath88 , where in the decay of @xmath1 , the allowed range of @xmath81 extends until @xmath89 . to extend the sum rules predictions to the whole physical region ,",
    "the sum rules predictions are fitted to the following function : @xmath90=\\frac{a}{(1-\\frac{q^2}{m_{fit}^2})}+\\frac{b}{(1-\\frac{q^2}{m_{fit}^2})^2}. \\label{parametrization1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the central values of the fit parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath91 are presented in table  [ tab:13 ] .",
    "this table also exhibits values of the form factors at @xmath92 .",
    "these errors presented in this table are due to the variation of the auxiliary parameters , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath27 , as well as the errors in the input parameters .",
    "note that for all form factors , the fit mass is always in the range @xmath93 . in a vector dominance model , although the double pole structure would not be expected , these form factors would have poles at the masses of the ( axial)vector meson that couples to the transition currents .",
    "the observed ( axial)vector @xmath94 mesons have masses in the range @xmath95 .",
    "although the fit mass tends to be slightly smaller than the observed masses , considering the uncertainties inherent in the sum rules calculations , the results are reasonable .",
    "to improve the results one should consider the @xmath96 corrections to the distributions amplitudes and more accurately determine the da s of @xmath0 baryon .",
