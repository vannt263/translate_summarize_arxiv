    "quantum correlation plays an essential role in quantum information science . in the early days of quantum information ,",
    "quantum correlation was characterized by entanglement , which is viewed as the main resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it engenders the dramatic speedup of a quantum computer over its classical counterpart .",
    "recently , it was found that entanglement is not the only reason to cause such speedup and that a similar speedup can also be achieved in the so - called deterministic one - qubit quantum computation by use of the zero - entanglement states @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to another measure of quantum correlation @xcite , i.e. quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that entanglement can not exhaust quantum correlation and qd characterizes the quantumness of correlations more generally than entanglement .",
    "the study of quantum correlations under decoherence has attracted much attention in recent years , because this study is expected to supply some insight regarding how to overcome the detrimental effects caused by decoherence on quantum correlation .",
    "it is found that qd @xcite exhibits some peculiar features which are absent for entanglement .",
    "first , qd of a two - qubit system under individual decoherence decays to zero in an asymptotical manner @xcite , which is much different from the sudden death behavior of entanglement in the same setting @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works also confirm similar results for the gaussian qd of continuous - variable systems .",
    "second , qd can be developed transiently from a certain initially classical state under a single local markovian dissipation channel , both for discrete - variable @xcite and continuous - variable @xcite systems .",
    "this is unattainable with entanglement .",
    "third , qd under decoherence shows a sudden change from the `` classical decoherence '' regime to the `` quantum decoherence '' regime @xcite . in the former regime",
    ", the classical correlation decays while qd is frozen to its initial value ; in the latter regime , qd starts to decay while classical correlation is frozen .",
    "this interesting phenomenon has been observed in optical @xcite and nmr @xcite systems .",
    "all of these features indicate that qd is the more robust than entanglement against decoherence . as a result , qd could be more preferred resource in quantum information processing .",
    "however , one finds that qd , discussed above , decays exclusively to zero in the long - time limit . to overcome the detrimental effects of decoherence on quantum information processing , it is of course desirable to preserve the initial quantum correlation in the long - time limit .    in this work",
    ", we propose a scheme to stabilize qd by appropriately engineering the reservoirs to introduce the non - markovian effect , an issue actively studied recently @xcite . by studying the correlation dynamics of a continuous - variable bipartite system ,",
    "we show that a finite gaussian qd can be frozen in the steady state .",
    "the essential physics is the formation of a localized mode in the subsystems and the non - markovian effect .",
    "an experimentally accessible scheme is proposed to observe the frozen qd by using a coupled cavity array system realized especially in a photonic crystal system @xcite .",
    "the result and its possible experimental realization could be significant in quantum information processing .",
    "consider two noninteracting harmonic oscillators coupled to two independent reservoirs .",
    "the hamiltonian of each local subsystem is ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the @xmath6-th harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath7 and its corresponding reservoir . the coupling strength between them is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the system is highly pertinent to a quantum - optical setting where the system oscillators can describe the quantized optical fields in cavity @xcite or in circuit @xcite qed , mechanical oscillators in opto - mechanics @xcite , and atomic ensemble under a large-@xmath9 limit @xcite .",
    "currently , most quantum optical experiments are performed at low temperatures and under vacuum condition .",
    "thus , we assume the reservoirs to be at zero temperature in this work .",
    "the exact decoherence dynamics of the system can be derived by feynman and vernon s influence - functional theory @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the system expressed in the coherent - state representation is given by @xmath10the coherent - state representation is defined as @xmath11 , which are the eigenstates of annihilation operators and obey the resolution of identity , @xmath12 with the integration measures defined as @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath15 . the propagating function @xmath16 is expressed as the path integral governed by an effective action consisting of the free actions of the forward and backward propagators of the system and the influence functional obtained from the integration of reservoir degrees of freedom . after evaluating the path integral",

    "( [ rout ] ) .",
    "the exact decoherence dynamics , determined by eq .",
    "( [ ut ] ) , essentially depends on the so - called spectral density @xmath22 , which characterizes the coupling strength of the different environmental modes to the system with respect to their frequencies . in the continuum limit ,",
    "it takes the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a cutoff frequency , and @xmath25 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the environment is classified as ohmic if @xmath26 , sub - ohmic if @xmath27 , and super - ohmic for @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "different spectral densities manifest different non - markovian decoherence dynamics .    to compare with the conventional born - markovian approximate description to such system ,",

    "it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ mas ] ) keeps the lindblad form but with time - dependent shifted frequency @xmath31 and decay rate @xmath32 .",

    "the time evolution of such state under eq .",
    "( [ rout ] ) keeps the gaussianity .",
    "the gaussian state can be fully characterized by the covariance matrix @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the @xmath37 covariance matrices for the @xmath6-th subsystems , and @xmath38 is the matrix containing the correlations between @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 can be easily estimated experimentally from the homodyne measurements to the amplitude quadratures @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the qd for the gaussian state can be calculated as follows .",
    "the total correlation for a bipartite system is given by the mutual information @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath48 is the reduced density matrix of the 1 ( 2 ) subsystem .",
    "another measure of mutual information that only quantifies the amount of classical correlations extractable by a gaussian measurement is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the covariance matrix of the measurement on mode 2 . as it only captures the classical correlations , the difference , @xmath51 , is a measure of gaussian quantum correlation that is coined gaussian qd .",
    "an explicit expression for this qd has been found  @xcite : @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 where the top refraction of eq .",

    "( [ ddf ] ) applies otherwise .",

    "the explicit form of the time evolution of the two - mode squeezed state and its corresponding covariance matrix are given in appendix [ cova ] .",
    "with the obtained covariance matrix ( [ coaf ] ) , the gaussian qd can be evaluated straightforwardly .     for super - ohmic spectral density in different ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 . @xmath63 and @xmath64 in ( a ) , and @xmath65 in ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for super - ohmic spectral density in different ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 . @xmath63 and @xmath64 in ( a ) , and @xmath65 in ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ]    choosing the super - ohmic spectral density , explicitly @xmath66 , as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "[ qdd ] the evolution of gaussian qd for the initial two - mode squeezed state .",
    "it has been shown that the super - ohmic spectral density can describe the phonon bath in one or three dimensions , depending on the symmetry properties of the strain field @xcite and a charged particle coupled to its own electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "compared with the ohmic and sub - ohmic spectral densities , the super - ohmic one is higher - frequency dominate , which will cause a strong modification to the short - time decoherence dynamics of the system .",
    "we can see from fig . [ qdd](a )",
    "that the gaussian qd decays to zero and a larger @xmath61 induces a faster decay , which are qualitatively consistent with the results under the markovian approximation , only when the coupling is vanishingly weak . with the increase of @xmath61 ,",
    "it is remarkable to find that the decay of the gaussian qd tends to slow down even to be totally stabilized .",
    "this is dramatically contrary to one s expectation that a stronger coupling between the system and the reservoir always induces a more severe decoherence to the system .",
    "the similar frozen gaussian qd can also be achieved with the increase of the cutoff frequency in fig . [",
    "qdd](b ) .",
    "we argue that the formation of a localized mode between each of the harmonic oscillators and its local reservoir plays an essential role in this frozen qd . to verify this",
    ", we perform a fourier transform to eq .",
    "( [ ut ] ) and obtain @xmath67 one can see that @xmath68 is a monotonically decreasing function in the region @xmath69 .",
    "it means that eq .",
    "( [ yee ] ) may have one and only one negative root if the system parameters fulfill @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "no further discrete root exists in the region @xmath71 because that would make the integration in @xmath68 divergent .",
    "after the inverse fourier transform , the obtained @xmath18 contributed from this discrete negative root will have a vanishing decay rate @xmath32 .",
    "this vanishing decay rate causes the decoherence inhabited in the system .",
    "it means that the discrete negative root for eq .",
    "( [ yee ] ) actually corresponds to a stationary state to eq .",
    "( [ ut ] ) , which preserves the quantum coherence in its superposed components during time evolution .",
    "we call this stationary state the localized mode of the whole system @xcite . for our super - ohmic spectral density ,",
    "we can readily show that the localized mode is formed when @xmath72 is fulfilled .",
    "this criterion gives a basic judgment on the condition under which the frozen gaussian qd is present .     and",
    "@xmath65 ( dot - dashed green line ) , @xmath73 ( dashed red line ) , and @xmath74 ( solid blue line ) and ( b ) @xmath65 and @xmath64 ( dot - dashed green line ) , @xmath75 ( dashed red line ) , and @xmath76 ( solid blue line ) .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]    to verify the dynamical consequence of the formed localized mode , we plot in fig . [ ug ] the decay rate in the case of figs . [ qdd](a ) and [ qdd](b ) .",
    "we can see that if the localized mode is absent , the decay rate stays positive and tends to a positive value , which , as expected , will induces monotonic decoherence to the system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ qdd](a ) when @xmath79 and in fig .",
    "[ qdd](b ) when @xmath80 . on the contrary , if the localized mode is present , the decay rate is transiently negative , which manifests that the lost information / energy of the system returns back from the reservoir .",
    "another characteristic that is different from the case when the localized mode is absent is that the decay rate tends to zero asymptotically .",
    "this vanishing decay rate causes the decoherence of the system to cease in the long - time limit .",
    "this gives an explanation why a strong coupling can induce a suppressed decoherence in fig .",
    "such anomalous decoherence also manifests as the deviation from the exponential decay of @xmath81 under the born - markovian approximation , as shown in appendix [ anomde ] .    from the above analysis",
    ", we can conclude that the frozen gaussian qd is present due to an interplay between the formed localized mode and the non - markovian effect .",
    "the localized mode provides an ability to freeze the gaussian qd , while the non - markovian effect provides a dynamical way to freeze the gaussian qd .",
    "the mechanism of the stable gaussian qd frozen in our system is linked to the non - markovian memory effect of the harmonic oscillator with its local reservoir when the localized mode is formed .",
    "it is much different from the case of two harmonic oscillators coupled to a common reservoir @xcite , where a stable qd is established due to an indirect interaction between the two harmonic oscillators induced effectively by the common reservoir .",
    "it is noted that our result is also of benefit to the analysis of entanglement under the same decoherence setting .",
    "since the decoherence is suppressed when the localized mode is formed , we also could expect a finite entanglement preservation in the steady state . in this case",
    ", the gaussian qd shows no qualitative difference from the entanglement .",
    "however , in the parameter regime where the localized mode is absent , it can be confirmed that the entanglement always decays to zero more rapidly than the gaussian qd does .",
    "this is consistent with the previous result that the qd is more robust than the entanglement to local decoherence @xcite .",
    "+    with the basic criterion at hand , we can see that the frozen gaussian qd upon which we elaborated is a generic phenomenon in open quantum systems , irrespective of the form of the spectral density .",
    "a best candidates with which to observe our prediction is the system of two arrays of coupled cavities , which can now be realized experimentally in micro - disc cavities coupled by one tapered optical fiber @xcite , in a photonic crystal system @xcite , and synthesized in an optical waveguide array system @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ cpa ] , we depict the schematic illustration to this scheme realized in a photonic crystal system . here , two initially correlated quantized optical fields are fed into the two system cavities . with some probability",
    "the optical fields in the two system cavities will hop , respectively , to the two spatially separated coupled cavity arrays .",
    "each of the local systems is governed by @xmath82 .",
    "a fourier transform @xmath83 recasts @xmath84 into @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and @xmath87 being the spatial separation between the two neighbor cavities of the cavity arrays .",
    "one can notice that the dispersion relation of the field in such structured reservoirs shows finite band width , which can induce a strong non - markovian even in the weak and intermediate coupling regimes .    in fig .",
    "[ cwa](a ) , we plot the possible formation of the localized mode manifested by the intersection points between the dotted line and each line in different parameter regimes .",
    "it can be seen that if there is no intersection point , which means the localized mode is absent , then the gaussian qd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cwa](b ) , decays to zero .",
    "whenever the localized mode is formed , certain finite gaussian qd can be frozen in the steady state . as an interesting observation",
    ", we find that the frozen gaussian qd in this case is even as large as its initial value .",
    "it means that the detrimental effect from decoherence is almost eliminated .",
    "another interesting observation is that the frozen qd can be obtained even if there is no strong coupling between the system and the reservoirs .",
