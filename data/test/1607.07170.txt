    "starting from a paper by dziuk and elliott @xcite , much insight into the stability and convergence properties of finite elements on evolving surfaces has been obtained by studying a linear parabolic equation on a given moving closed surface @xmath0 .",
    "the strong formulation of this model problem is to find a solution @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) with given initial data @xmath4 to the linear partial differential equation @xmath5where @xmath6 denotes the material time derivative , @xmath7 is the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator on the surface , and @xmath8 is the tangential divergence of the _ given _ velocity @xmath9 of the surface .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an excellent review article ( up to 2012 ) on the numerical analysis of this and related problems .",
    "optimal - order @xmath10 error bounds for piecewise linear finite elements are shown in @xcite and maximum - norm error bounds in @xcite .",
    "stability and convergence of full discretizations obtained by combining the evolving surface finite element method ( esfem ) with various time discretizations are shown in @xcite .",
    "convergence of semi- and full discretizations using high - order evolving surface finite elements is studied in @xcite .",
    "arbitrary euler  lagrangian ( ale ) variants of the esfem method for this equation are studied in @xcite .",
    "convergence properties of the esfem and of full discretizations for quasilinear parabolic equations on prescribed moving surfaces are studied in @xcite .    beyond the above model problem",
    ", there is considerable interest in cases where the velocity of the evolving surface is _ not given explicitly _ , but depends on the solution @xmath11 of the parabolic equation ; see , e.g. , @xcite for physical and biological models where such situations arise .",
    "contrary to the case of surfaces with prescribed motion , there exists so far no numerical analysis for solution - driven surfaces in @xmath12 , to the best of our knowledge .    for the case of evolving _ curves _ in @xmath13 , there are recent preprints by pozzi & stinner @xcite and barrett , deckelnick & styles @xcite , who couple the curve - shortening flow with diffusion on the curve and study the convergence of finite element discretizations without and with a tangential part in the discrete velocity , respectively . the analogous problem for two- or",
    "higher - dimensional surfaces would be to couple mean curvature flow with diffusion on the surface .",
    "studying the convergence of finite elements for these coupled problems , however , remains illusive as long as the convergence of esfem for mean curvature flow of closed surfaces is not understood .",
    "this has remained an open problem since dziuk s formulation of such a numerical method for mean curvature flow in his 1990 paper @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider different velocity laws for coupling the surface motion with the diffusion on the surface . conceivably the simplest velocity law would be to prescribe the normal velocity at any surface point as a function of the solution value and possibly its tangential gradient at this point : @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the outer normal vector and @xmath17 is a given smooth scalar - valued function .",
    "this does , however , not appear to lead to a well - posed problem , and in fact we found no mention of this seemingly obvious choice in the literature .",
    "here we study instead a _ regularized velocity law _ : @xmath18 with a fixed regularization parameter @xmath19 .",
    "this elliptic regularization will turn out to permit us to give a complete stability and convergence analysis of the esfem semidiscretization , for finite elements of polynomial degree at least two .",
    "the case of linear finite elements is left open in the theory of this paper , but will be considered in our numerical experiments .",
    "the stability and convergence results can be extended to full discretizations with linearly implicit backward difference time - stepping , as we plan to show in later work .",
    "our approach also applies to the esfem discretization of coupling a _",
    "regularized mean curvature flow _ and diffusion on the surface : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes mean curvature on the surface @xmath22 .",
    "the error analysis is further extended to a _ dynamic velocity law _",
    "@xmath23 a physically more relevant dynamic velocity law would be based on momentum and mass balance , such as incompressible navier  stokes motion of the surface coupled to diffusion on the surface , where the velocity @xmath9 is determined together with the density @xmath24 and the pressure @xmath25 by the equations @xmath26 we expect that our analysis extends to such a system , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "we recall the basics of the evolving surface finite element method and describe the semidiscrete problem .",
    "its matrix - vector formulation is useful not only for the implementation , but will play a key role in the stability analysis of this paper .    in section  [ section : main result ] we present the main result of the paper , which gives convergence estimates for the esfem semidiscretization with finite elements of polynomial degree at least @xmath27 .",
    "we further outline the main ideas and the organization of the proof .    in section  [ section : preliminaries ] we present auxiliary results that are used to relate different surfaces to one another .",
    "they are the key technical results used later on in the stability analysis .",
    "section  [ section : uncoupled problem ] contains the stability analysis for the regularized velocity law with a prescribed driving term . in section  [ section : coupled problem ] this is extended to the stability analysis for coupling surface pdes and surface motion .",
    "in section  [ section : geometric estimates ] we briefly recall some geometric estimates used for estimating the consistency errors , which are the defects obtained on inserting the interpolated exact solution into the scheme .",
    "section  [ section : defect bounds ] deals with the defect estimates .",
