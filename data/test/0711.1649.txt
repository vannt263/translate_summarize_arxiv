    "the quark delocalization , color screening model ( qdcsm ) is an extension of the naive quark cluster model and was developed with the aim of addressing multi - quark systems @xcite .",
    "first of all , a quark - delocalization similar to the percolation of electrons in atoms is introduced to take into account the contribution of orbital excitation or the mutual distortion of hadrons in the interaction region .",
    "second , a different parametrization of the confinement interaction is assumed for the quark pairs in different states .",
    "the parametrization is an effort to account for the qcd interactions corresponding to various hidden color configurations in the multi - quark system which have not been modeled in two body interaction model .",
    "the main advantage of qdcsm is that it allows the multi - quark system to choose its most favorable configuration through its own dynamics .",
    "this is accomplished by varying the energy of the system with respect to the delocalization parameter , which is a tentative approach to take into account the self - consistency of the quark and gluon distributions in the course of hadron interaction process .",
    "this model reproduces the existing baryon - baryon interaction data well @xcite ( bound - state deuteron as well as @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 scattering ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to apply the qdcsm to study the pentaquark system .",
    "some generalizations are needed here : the quark can delocalize among clusters and the color confinement between quarks in different clusters is screened as before , but now the clusters may be colorful as well as colorless .",
    "we admit there should be difference of qcd vacuum between colorless hadrons and colorful ones and so color screening should be different but in order to avoid new parameters we employ the original one tentatively .",
    "the quark delocalization is realized by replacing the single particle orbital wavefunctions ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 by @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) : @xmath84 @xmath85 here , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are variational parameters determined by the dynamics of the multi - quark system rather than adjustable ( fitting ) parameters .",
    "the color screeening is realized by re - parameterizing the color confinement interaction as follows : @xmath89 details of the model can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "( for qdcsm , the energy for given @xmath17 and @xmath18 is obtained by varying the energy with the delocalization parameters . )",
    "if there exists minimum energy at finite separations @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then the energy @xmath92 is taken as the mass of the state .",
    "the calculated transformation coefficients are listed in table a1 of appendix .",
    "( the index of diquark cluster is given in table a2 . ) in this table , all the channels are included , so it can be used to expand the physical bases in terms of the symmetry bases , and vice versa .",
    "this table can be used for any quark model hamiltonian but restricted to jw @xmath0 cluster configuration . for meson - baryon cluster configuration one",
    "needs other transformation coefficients which will be given in a company paper .",
    "all possible states within the @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 three - flavor world have been calculated .",
    "both single - channel and channel coupling calculations have been carried out with three quark models : the naive quark model , the chiral quark model and the qdcsm .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 . because the parity is a good quantum number , so the results for positive and negative parity states are listed separately . to save space , only the lowest single channel ( sc ) and channel coupling ( cc ) results",
    "are given .",
    "all the states with @xmath96 but only several states with @xmath97 are given . because most states with @xmath97 have quite similar features to the ones with @xmath96 part .",
    "some general features are listed below .",
    "\\(1 ) the parity of the lowest channel is negative in all three quark models , which is different from jaffe - wilczek s estimation .",
    "the diquark with orbital , color , spin , flavor symmetry : [ 2 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 11 ] does have the lowest energy under the color - magnetic interaction , however the pauli principle excludes the @xmath17-wave orbital motion between two such diquarks .",
    "the @xmath98-wave excitation and the  residue \" interaction between two diquarks make the energy of jw state higher than the state where two diquarks have the symmetry : @xmath99\\times [ 2]$ ] ( orbital ) , @xmath100\\times [ 2]$ ] ( color ) , @xmath100\\times [ 2]$ ] ( spin ) and @xmath100\\times [ 11]$ ] ( flavor ) , where @xmath17-wave orbital is permitted .",
    "\\(2 ) generally there exist effective attractions for both positive and negative parity states , thus forming resonance in both parity states is possible .",
    "this is due to the hidden color structure of jw configuration as discussed in the introduction part .",
    "however in most cases , the attraction is not enough to make the energy lower than the corresponding threshold , i.e. , the sum of corresponding baryon and meson mass .",
    "therefore there will be no narrow resonances except there is special mechanism to prevent the decay .",
    "fig.4 gives the effective potential for the channel - coupling result of @xmath102 in qdcsm .",
    "the other two models have similar effective potentials as qdcsm .",
    "other states have similar effective potentials as that of @xmath102 shown in fig.4 . in qdcsm ,",
    "the mass of @xmath102 is 1786 mev which is too high to match the experimentally claimed 1540 mev .",
    "other two models give even higher mass of @xmath6 . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the qdcsm mass is about 1884 mev , a little higher than the claimed 1862 mev .",
    "other two models mass of @xmath103 are much higher ( 1974 mev for chiral quark model and 2145 for naive quark model ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the spectroscopy of qdcsm and chiral quark model are quite similar except a mass shift .",
    "this result is quite consistent with our former work on @xmath77 interaction @xcite , where the two models with quite different mechanism of intermediate range attraction give similar results of deuteron properties and @xmath77 scattering phase shifts , and shows the @xmath104 meson effect can be replaced by qdcsm mechanism for pentaquark systems as well .",
    "however the naive qauark model results are quite different .",
    "the naive quark model is quite possible not a realistic one for multi - quark system even though it is a good model for single hadrons because it can not reproduce the intermediate range @xmath77 attraction and the deuteron properties .",
    "\\(4 ) in qdcsm , the majority of the lowest energy states have the triangle pattern : the separations between the two diquarks are @xmath105 fm and the separation between the anti - quark and the center of the two diquarks is @xmath106 fm except few positive parity states . while , in the chiral quark model and naive quark model , the lowest energy states always have the linear pattern : the separations between the two diquarks are @xmath107 fm and the separation between the anti - quark to the diquark center is 0.1fm .",
    "we do nt have any experimental data to check which one is more realistic , lattice qcd calculation might provide useful information .",

    "<S> group theoretic method for the systematic study of multi - quark states is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of matrix elements of many - body hamiltonian is simplified by transforming the physical bases ( quark cluster bases ) to symmetry bases ( group chain classified bases ) , where the fractional parentage expansion method can be used . </S>",
    "<S> five - quark system is taken as an example in this study . </S>",
    "<S> the jaffe - wilczek @xmath0 configuration is chosen as one of examples to construct the physical bases and the transformation coefficients between physical bases and symmetry ones are shown to be related to the @xmath1 isoscalar factors and a complete transformation coefficients table is given . </S>",
    "<S> the needed isoscalar factors and fractional parentage coefficients had been calculated with our new group representation theory and published before . </S>",
    "<S> three quark models : the naive glashow - isgur , salamanca and quark delocalization color screening , are used to show the general applicability of the new multi - quark calculation method and general results of constituent quark models for five - quark states are given . </S>"
