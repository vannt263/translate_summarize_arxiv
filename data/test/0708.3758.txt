    "the study of dwarf galaxies and the milky way halo can provide important clues to the formation and assembly of the local group of galaxies and its individual constituents , as well as test cosmological theories . in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , an abundance of subhaloes should be present around milky way type galaxies .",
    "the observed number of satellites is , however , one or two orders of magnitudes lower than what cdm theory predicts @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered satellites partially alleviate this discrepancy , but if the cdm predictions are accurate , many more new satellite galaxies are to be discovered .",
    "another prediction of cdm theories is that galaxies are formed hierarchically , i.e. built up by accreting smaller systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our goals for this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we adapt the cmd - fitting software match @xcite for use on sdss data , making use of the theoretical isochrones provided by @xcite , and describe several methods of applying this software to the data .",
    "a set of globular clusters taken from the sdss data is used to test both the algorithmic approach and the theoretical isochrones .",
    "second , we apply match to the sdss data for the new milky way satellites ( that were recently discovered using the same sdss data ) , to provide a uniform analysis of these objects and constrain their population parameters .    in section [ sec : methods ] we describe the data and the different cmd - fitting methods .",
    "the tests on globular clusters are done in section [ sec : gctests ] and in section [ sec : newsats ] we analyze the properties of the new galactic satellites .",
    "we conclude and summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",

    "for the work presented in this paper we use photometry in the two most sensitive bands , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a fully automated data reduction pipeline produces accurate astrometric and photometric measurements for all detected objects @xcite .",
    "photometric accuracy is on the order of 2% down to @xmath522.5 and @xmath622 @xcite , and comparison with deeper surveys has shown that the data are complete to @xmath622 .",
    "we use stellar data extracted from the sdss archive with artifacts removed and we apply the extinction corrections from @xcite provided by dr5 .    in order for the cmd fitting with match to work , a model describing the completeness and the photometric accuracy as a function of magnitude is needed .",
    "completeness has been checked for @xmath2-band by comparing detection of stars and galaxies by sdss with the deeper combo-17 survey . for stellar sources",
    "the completeness is 100% to @xmath2=22 and then drops to 0% at r=23.5 .",
    "since the stellar classification of combo-17 starts to become incomplete at approximately one magnitude fainter than in sdss , this completeness is not extremely accurate , but amply sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the photometric errors given by the automated reduction pipeline have been found to be very accurate @xcite .",
    "comparison of the photometric accuracy in @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of apparent magnitude shows similar behavior , but in @xmath1 the rise in the uncertainties occurs some 0.5 magnitudes fainter . for the @xmath1-band completeness",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of these methods lies in the fact that all photometric information from imaging in two bands can be used simultaneously in a robust and numerically well - defined way .",
    "the software package we use is match , which was written and successfully used for the cmd analysis of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the software works by converting an observed cmd into a hess diagram ( a two - dimensional histogram of stellar density as a function of color and magnitude ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and comparing it with synthetic hess diagrams of model populations .",
    "to create these synthetic hess diagrams , theoretical isochrones are convolved with a model of the photometric accuracy and completeness .",
    "the use of hess diagrams enables a pixel - by - pixel comparison of observations to models and a maximum - likelihood technique is used to find the best - fitting single model , or best linear combination of models . to account for contamination by fore- and background stars , a `` control field ''",
    "cmd needs to be provided .",
    "match will then use the control field hess diagram as an extra ` model population ' that can be scaled up or down .",
    "the resulting output will be the best - fitting linear combination of population models plus the control field .    to construct star formation histories ( sfhs ) and age - metallicity relations ( amrs ) , a set of theoretical isochrones",
    "is needed that spans a sufficient range of ages , masses and metallicities .",
    "when match was written , the only published set of isochrones with full age and metallicity coverage available was provided by @xcite .",
    "since we are specifically interested in the application to sdss data , we need isochrones in the sdss photometric system .",
    "the only set available to date is one from @xcite and has the same parameter space coverage .",
    "some worries exist about the accuracy of the isochrone calibration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was limited to three systems available in the first data release ( dr1 ) of sdss .",
    "this unavoidably adds an extra source of uncertainty to all cmd fitting results .",
    "one of the main motivations for the various tests that are described in this paper is to see whether reasonable results can be obtained using the current @xcite isochrones .",
    "we use match for slightly different purposes than originally described by @xcite ; the new `` modes '' are described briefly below .",
    "match was originally developed to solve for the sfh and amr of a stellar system for which all stars can be assumed to be at the same distance , such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies . in this original mode of match the distance and the foreground extinction to all stars",
    "are fixed a priori for each fit . from a set of age bins and metallicity bins , the combination that best fits the observed cmd",
    "is found , resulting in an estimate of the sfh and amr . by doing the same fit with different values of the foreground extinction and distance ,",
    "these two latter parameters can also be determined by comparing the goodness - of - fit of the individual fits . in principle , parameters like the steepness of the imf and the binary fraction can be constrained in the same fashion , although in most cases the data quality and the degeneracies between different parameters will prevent the determination of all of these parameters simultaneously . analyzing the parameter range of acceptable fits also gives robust error estimates for the sfh and amr ; this approach we refer to as match s `` standard mode '' .",
    "to apply cmd fitting techniques to nearby and extended stellar systems ( for example substructure within the milky way as in @xcite ) , the assumption that all stars are practically equidistant need not hold . to fit populations at differing distances",
    "simultaneously we have implemented a new way in which to run match that keeps the same number of free parameters , or parameter dimensions , to be explored .",
    "while in the standard mode the distance is fixed and age and metallicity are independent variables , here the distance becomes a free parameter , but age and metallicity are being limited via a specified age metallicity relation ( amr ) . for any given amr",
    "there is only one `` population parameter '' , e.g. age with a certain metallicity linked to each age bin .",
    "of course , different age - metallicity relations can be explored , potentially covering a wide range of possibilities .",
    "it seems sensible to choose an amr that is appropriate for the studied stellar population on astrophysical grounds , such as the expected or known metallicity evolution .",
    "for example , for the study of structures in the galactic thin disk one would consider a different amr than for the study of a metal - poor dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , within this new mode of running match the choice of amr is completely flexible and a flat amr ( no dependence of metallicity on age ) or even an amr where metallicity decreases with time is possible .      when studying low - luminosity or low surface brightness contrast systems , such as some of the recently discovered dsphs , or systems at low galactic latitudes , for example substructures in the milky way",
    ", the contamination of the cmds of these systems by fore- and background stars will be very high .",
    "if the ratio of ` member ' stars to field stars becomes low , the s / n of the cmd features to be fit consequently becomes very low .",
    "in such cases , all free parameters used to constrain distance , age , and metallicity in the match mode of sections [ subsec : sfhamr ] and [ subsec : distsol ] can no longer be constrained by the data alone . to test a more restricted set of hypotheses in the case of low s / n systems we have developped a single component ( sc ) fitting mode for match . in this mode , template",
    "stellar population models are created that consist of a single component with given , fixed distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range . such a sc template is fit to the data together with a control field .",
    "since the template consists of a single component , the only free parameters during the fit are the absolute scaling of ( i.e. the number of stars in ) the template and the control field .",
    "for each individual sc ( i.e. for each combination of distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range ) , a value of the goodness - of - fit is obtained . comparing the goodness - of - fit values for all the sc s we",
    "can then find the best - fitting templates and thus constrain the overall properties of the system .",
    "the quality of each fit is expressed by the goodness - of - fit parameter q , determined using the maximum - likelihood technique described in @xcite .",
    "this statistic is meant to measure how likely it is that the observed distribution of stars would result from a random drawing from the fitted model . in the sc",
    "fitting scheme we know that our fits will not be perfect since an sc model will not be a perfect representation of a real stellar population , but we are primarily interested in a likelihood - ratio test for a range of sc models .",
    "the expected variance in the parameter @xmath7 for a certain cmd can be calculated from poisson statistics and also obtained from monte carlo simulations using random drawings from the models .",
    "all fits with a value of @xmath7 less than 1 @xmath8 away from that of the best - fit sc model can be considered statistically acceptable , under the assumption that the best fit is a reasonable representation of the data . taking all these fits together , error estimates on the fit parameters can be determined from the encountered spread of the parameter values .",
    "this approach of using relative values of @xmath7 should only be used in cases where the `` best fit '' is a reasonable approximation of the data . in cases where there are several very different prominent stellar populations",
    "this will not be the case and results will break down . studying different parts of the cmd separately can help to circumvent such problems , as is done in @xcite and also in section [ subsec : nsscfits ] of this paper for the dwarf galaxy leo t.      the same cmd fitting techniques can also be used to detect or verify , faint stellar over - densities in large datasets like that of the sdss survey . in case of an overdensity at a specific distance , the stars will not only cluster around a certain spatial position , but also along a certain locus in the cmd .",
    "the method we have developped works by fitting the cmd of a small target patch of sky both with a control cmd obtained from a large area around the target patch and with the same control field plus a simple stellar population model . if no over - density is present , the fit with the control cmd should be good and no significant improvement in fit quality will result by including an extra stellar population model . however , if there is an over - density present and the parameters of the population model , such as distance , age and metallicity , are close enough to those of the over - density , the fit including the model will result in a significant improvement in the fit quality . by doing this for a range of models the presence of a stellar over - density can be assessed by looking at the difference in the fit quality parameter , @xmath9 , between the control cmd fit and the control cmd plus model fit .",
    "moreover , by comparing the values of @xmath9 for different models , a rough estimate of the properties of the overdensity can be obtained at the same time .",
    "an important prerequisite for this method is of course that the over - density should contribute a larger fraction of the total number of stars to the target cmd than to the control cmd , and ideally should be contained completely within the target patch .",
    "this means that over - densities will be detected with the highest s /",
    "n if their size matches the size of the target patch .",

    "we create a few realistic artificial cmds and apply sfh fitting , sc fitting and distance fitting methods to these to try and recover their properties . using the theoretical isochrones from @xcite , a salpeter initial mass function @xcite , and our model for the photometric errors and completeness of the sdss data , we generate artificial stellar populations , to which field stars taken from the sdss data are added . in total we create four cmds , shown in figure [ fig : fakecmds ] .",
    "the number of stars in each cmd is chosen to be the same , to make for a fair comparison .",
    "cmds 1 and 3 contain a simple , single burst stellar population , located at different distances , so that either the ms and msto or the rgb and hb are prominent features .",
    "artificial cmds 2 and 4 contain two different age and metallicity populations , again with the cmds corresponding to different distances .",
    "the detailed parameters of the artificial populations are listed in table [ tab : fakegcprops ] . from the sdss archives all stellar sources in a 5@xmath115   patch of sky close to the globular cluster m13",
    "were extracted and a small fraction used to create the field star contamination in these cmds .",
    "the remaining sources will be used as a `` control field '' population when fitting these background contaminated cmds .",
    "we recover the sfhs of the artificial cmds by running match with nine age bins and twelve metallicity bins .",
    "the age bins are defined in log @xmath12 because the isochrones are spaced more evenly in log @xmath12 than in @xmath12 , with the oldest running from 10.0 to 10.2 ( 10 gyr to 15.8 gyr ) and the youngest from 8.6 to 8.8 ( 400 myr to 630 myr ) .",
    "the metallicity range of [ fe / h]@xmath132.4 to 0.0 is covered by twelve bins of 0.2 dex width .",
    "thus , the artificial cmds are fit with 108 model cmds plus the `` control field '' stars , for a total of 109 partial cmds",
    ". the best fitting linear combination of model cmds will form the resulting sfh and metallicity evolution . to get a sense of the uncertainties on the sfh , each cmd is fit thrice , each time with a slightly different assumed distance .",
    "the distance moduli used are 14.3 , 14.4 and 14.5 mag .",
    "the resulting sfhs and metallicities are presented in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] as the relative star formation rate ( sfr ) and as [ fe / h ] as function of the age of the stars .    for the sc",
    "fits models are created for a grid of parameters with a distance modulus range of 2.0 with 0.1 magnitude intervals centered on the the actual distance modulus ( table [ tab : fakegcprops ] ) .",
    "ages used run from 9.0 to 10.2 in log @xmath12 with bin widths of 0.1 dex and metallicities go from [ fe / h]@xmath132.1 to 0.0 in steps of 0.1 dex and bin widths of 0.2 dex .",
    "each model plus the `` control field '' is fit to an artificial cmd , after which the resulting goodness - of - fit values are compared .",
    "the resulting contour plots showing the best - fitting parameter combinations are shown in figure [ fig : fakescfit ] .    using the new distance solution option of match we solve for the sfh of the artificial cmds again while fixing the metallicity to a single , uniform value .",
    "the same age bins are used as for the sfh fits described above , and a distance range of 3.0 is probed with 0.1 magnitude resolution . including the `` control field '' , 271 partial cmds are used in these fits .",
    "the fits are done at three different values of the metallicity : [ fe / h]@xmath131.6 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.4 to probe the uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : fakesfhdist ] shows the resulting sfhs in relative sfrs and distance determinations .",
    "the sfhs in figures [ fig : fakesfhamr ] and [ fig : fakesfhdist ] show that the software succesfully recovers the single burst in cmds 1 and 2 , and the two distinct episodes of star formation in cmds 3 and 4 .",
    "some bleeding of star formation in adjacent bins will occur even when the fitted age bins exactly match the input sfh @xcite .",
    "therefore it is to be expected that this also happens here , since the duration of the input star forming episodes do not match any age bins perfectly .",
    "it should be noted that the error bars in the sfhs represent the range of sfrs encountered in each age bin within the three fits on which the sfhs are based , which means that the errors between adjacent bins are correllated .",
    "for example , in the sfh of cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] the two bins at ages of 2 to 4 gyr are not independent ; when the sfr in one of them is low , it is high in the other .",
    "that the age found for the young population in cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhdist ] is the natural result of the metallicities in the fit being lower than the actual metallicity of the younger population . in all cases ,",
    "the average metallicities and distances found in figures [ fig : fakesfhamr ] and [ fig : fakesfhdist ] agree well with the input values .",
    "turning to the sc fits in figure [ fig : fakescfit ] , we see that for cmds 1 and 3 , the input properties ( indicated by stars ) are recovered very well . because there is a degeneracy between distance , age and metallicity",
    "when only the ms and msto are seen , the properties of cmd 1 are , however , constrained more poorly than for cmd 3 .",
    "since the sc fits use a single model population , the results for cmds with multiple populations , such as cmds 2 and 4 , can not be expected to properly recover the properties of all stars .",
    "rather , the population representing the majority of stars in the cmd will have the strongest weight .",
    "this is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 4 , that recover the properties of the older population , that dominates the star counts in the rgb and hb . for cmd 2 ,",
    "however , the upper ms and msto of the younger population has such high s / n that this population does influence the sc fits significantly and the favored age is relatively young ( @xmath144 gyr ) .",
    "this shows that for high s / n cmds with a complex stellar population make - up , the sc fits is not well suited ; they were , however , developed for application to low s / n cmds .",
    "what distinguishes these artificial cmds from the real data , is that the artificial stellar populations are based on the exact same isochrones , imf , and photometric error and completeness model as used by match .",
    "inaccuracies in any of these will degrade the fit results one obtains for real data compared to the results for the artificial data .",

    "pal 14 in particular represents the case of a very sparsely populated system with high contamination from field stars .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the results of applying match to these gcs in the four different modes described in section [ sec : modes ] . in fitting the cmds of these objects",

    "for all the fits in this section we will assume a slope for the stellar initial mass function that is close to salpeter ; the binary fraction is assumed to be 0.1 , in line with recent observational and theoretical evidence for low binary fractions in globulars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our fits favor the slightly lower metallicity from @xcite rather than the higher value from @xcite .    turning to the bottom half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] with the three metal - poor clusters , we see that here also the results are consistent with a purely old population , although the sfhs of m15 and ngc 2419 show a non - zero sfr in a few younger age bins . in the case of m15",
    "this is due to the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars that are not properly reproduced by the theoretical isochrones , causing the code to fit them as a younger turn - off .",
    "this demonstrates that cmd fitting results always need to be looked at in detail in order to understand their implications .",
    "the age distribution in ngc 2419 is not very well constrained because no msto is present in the cmd .",
    "the metallicities of m15 and m92 are recovered well for the old stars . while the estimated metallicity of @xmath101.9 for ngc 2419 is on the high side , for these metal - poor gcs the recovered metallicities are within 0.2 dex of the literature values .",
    "as described in section [ subsec : scfit ] above , in the single component ( sc ) fitting mode an individual model cmd is fit to the data together with the control cmd , rather than a whole set of models .",
    "the results therefore provide information on the characteristic properties of the dominant stellar population in the cmd .",
    "we sample the 3d parameter space of distance , age and metallicity by using one of nine age bins , one of 21 distance bins , and one of 23 metallicity bins .",
    "the age bins have a width of 0.1 log - years , going from 10.1 - 10.2 log - years ( 12.5 gyr to 15.8 gyr ) to 9.7 - 9.8 log - years ( 5 gyr to 6.3 gyr ) in steps of 0.05 log - years .",
    "this age range more than suffices for these gcs .",
    "we use a distance modulus range of two magnitudes centered on the literature value with a resolution of 0.1 magnitude .",
    "metallicity bins are centered at [ fe / h]@xmath132.2 to 0.0 with an inter - bin distance of 0.1 dex and a width of 0.2 dex .    after matching each of the 4347 sc options to each gc and determining the expected variance in the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath7",
    ", we take the best fit as our measurement and compare the other fits with respect to these best values . the resulting likelihood contour plots for metallicity ,",
    "distance and age measurements are shown in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] .",
    "note that in these contour plots , the third parameter is unconstrained , rather than fixed at its known value .",
    "if the third parameter would be kept fixed , the contours would shrink significantly .",
    "in general the agreement with the literature values ( indicated with asterisks in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] ) is very good . the small offset for m13 is most likely due to inaccuracies in the isochrones , which illustrates the added uncertainty in cmd fitting results that depend on a single set of theoretical isochrones .",
    "our distance modulus measurement from the sc fits for m15 lies exactly in between the two literature values , while for ngc 2419 our results clearly favor the smaller distance value from @xcite . from the two metallicity determinations in the literature for ngc 6229 , the fit results agree significantly better with the lower metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath311.4 dex . in some cases",
    ", it looks as if the peak of the likelihood lies outside of the parameter space probed , at lower metallicities or older ages .",
    "unfortunately , these limits of the parameter space are dictated by the parameter range of the available isochrones .",
    "also shown in the right column of figure [ fig : gcscfit ] are the observed cmds of the gcs , with contours representing the model populations . in most cases",
    "we used the literature parameters for these models , except for m15 , where we chose a distance modulus of 15.2 , the mean of the two different available values . for ngc 6229 and ngc 2419",
    "we use the literature metallicities and distance moduli that best correspond to our results .",
    "the agreement of model and data is generally acceptable , although inaccuracies , especially in the sub - giant branch , can be seen in m13 and m15 .",
    "important to note is the influence of the degeneracies between age , distance , and metallicity .",
    "for the nearby systems , m13 , m15 and m92 , where the fit is driven by the ms , there is a clear distance - metallicity covariance ; the left - most panels in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] show that the distance estimate increases with increasing metallicity . for the distant gc pal 14 , where the fit is driven by the rgb ,",
    "the covariance is the other way around .",
    "another important , yet not wholly surprising , point is that higher s / n in the cmd features results in much tighter contours , illustrated by the fact that m13 , m15 and ngc 2419 give the best constrained results .",
    "ngc 2419 has the additional advantage that the well - populated hb provides a very strong constraint on the distance , making this system the best - constrained of the lot .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsec : distsol ] , we explore fits for different distances and different ages , with the metallicity linked to the age .",
    "the result of each fit is a sfh with a ( potentially different ) distance for each age bin ; differing distances for different sub - populations are not astrophysically relevant for globular clusters , but serve as a test case . for fitting the gcs it seems reasonable to use the same metallicity in all age bins .",
    "we use the same nine age bins as in section [ subsec : gcsfh ] . in distance space",
    "we use a distance modulus range of three magnitudes centered on the known distance of each system with a resolution of 0.1 magnitudes , giving a total of 31 distance bins . for each",
    "gc we carry out three fits with different metallicities , centered on the literature values ( see table [ tab : gcproperties ] ) with offsets of 0.1 dex . for ngc 6229",
    "we assume the lower metallicity value [ fe / h]@xmath131.43 , which is favored by our sfh and single component fitting results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gcdfit ] we present the age - distance distributions that result from these fits . compared to the fits in section [ subsec : gcsfh ] the number of free parameters per fit is the same , with now metallicity fixed instead of distance .",
    "thus , in general similar quality sfhs should be expected , although not necessarily exactly the same . while in the `` standard '' sfh fits the star formation within an age bin can be spread over several metallicity bins , it can now be spread over several distance bins .",
    "these spread will translate differently into the color - magnitude plane , and therefore can result in differences between the sfhs in figures [ fig : gcsfh ] and [ fig : gcdfit ] .    as in figure",
    "[ fig : gcsfh ] all gcs are found to have a single peak in their sfr in the oldest age bin , in some cases with some bleeding into the adjacent bin .",
    "the extension of the sfh of pal 14 to more recent times has large uncertainties and is not significant .",
    "it should be taken into account that the exact age of this system is difficult to constrain with sdss data , since the msto is not present .",
    "interesting to see is that m13 and m92 show almost no bleeding into the second oldest age bin here , while they did in figure [ fig : gcsfh ] ; for m15 and ngc 6229 the exact opposite is the case .",
    "apparently , the former are fit better with some distance spread , while the latter benefit more from a metallicity spread .",
    "this does not necessarily reflect an actual distance or metallicity spread , but rather shows that inaccuracies in the isochrones are sometimes better accounted for one way and sometimes another way .",
    "the distances we find for the oldest age bin , and therefore for the majority of the stars , show very good agreement with the literature values . comparing figures [ fig : gcsfh ] and [ fig : gcdfit ] shows that the sfhs obtained when fixing either the distance or the metallicity are very similar .",
    "the main motivation for enabling this distance fitting mode was , however , not to analyze single - distance systems , but to be able to cope with cases where stars are located at different distances ( cf .",
    "canis major , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to demonstrate this application",
    ", we combine the cmds of m13 and ngc 6229 , resulting in a cmd containing two populations with similar metallicities and ages , but located at significantly different distances .",
    "the cmds of m13 , ngc 6229 and the combined cmd are shown in panels a ) , b ) and c ) of figure [ fig : m13ngc6229 ] .",
    "we run distance solution fits to these cmds in the same way as before , with the same age bins , but now using a larger distance modulus range , from 12.0 to 19.0 magnitudes with a resolution of 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "three fits are run , for uniform metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath131.4 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.6 .",
    "we include also a control cmd in the fit which is the control cmd of m 13 ; since m 13 and ngc 6229 are only 10 degrees apart and at similar galactic latitudes , this gives good results .",
    "the averaged best - fitting distributions of stars over the grid of age and distance bins are shown in panels d ) , e ) and f ) of figure [ fig : m13ngc6229 ] .",
    "both ages and distances of the two populations are recovered extremely well , with all stars in the oldest age bin ( @xmath3010 gyr ) , m13 stars centered at a distance modulus of 14.4 and ngc 6229 stars at a distance modulus of 17.4 .",
    "moreover , the result for the combined cmd is almost exactly the sum of the results for the individual cmds , clearly illustrating the power of match to decompose more complex cmds .",
    "the final application we describe and test here is aimed at algorithmically detecting stellar populations which are confined to a limited distance and area on the sky , i.e. that form `` overdensities '' .",
    "of course , the gcs used in this section are very obvious stellar overdensities and should be detected at very high s / n . following the approach described in section [ subsec : detect ] we define a grid of 20@xmath1120   boxes in each 5@xmath115   field that was obtained from the sdss catalog server , with the central box centered on the gc .",
    "the cmd of each box is fit with the control field cmd and with the control field plus a simple population model . for each",
    "gc we use a model with the appropriate distance , age and metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig : gcareas ] shows the difference in the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath7 between the two fits for areas around each gc .",
    "note that for m15 and m92 , the 5@xmath115   field is not completely observed by sdss .",
    "clearly , all gcs produce high peaks in @xmath9 . since @xmath9 is roughly proportional to the number of stars attributed to the population model in the model fit , the objects with the largest numbers of stars produce the strongest detections . only in the plot for pal 14",
    "does the vertical scale allow the random variations in @xmath9 to be visible in the area around the object .",
    "the s / n of these detections should be measured with respect to this random noise .",
    "using the 216 boxes around the central 9 boxes we obtain an estimate of the rms in @xmath9 from random variations in the cmds .",
    "negative values of @xmath9 are suppressed because a negative number of stars in a population is unphysical , which has to be taken into account when calculating the rms .",
    "even pal 14 , a rather sparsely populated and distant cluster , is detected with high s / n , as @xmath32 .",
    "in summary , section [ sec : gctests ] has illustrated the robustness and precision with which match can interpret high - quality cmds in a variety of circumstances . over the past few years",
    "the importance of deep wide - field surveys for the study of the stellar components of the milky way galaxy has been demonstrated by 2mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "can be explained by their low surface brightness , as shown by @xcite .",
    "apart from the promise that more systems of even lower surface brightness might be waiting to be discovered by future generations of deep imaging surveys , this fact raises intriguing questions .",
    "do these systems show that star formation can occur under conditions generally considered to be incapable of supporting such activity , or have these systems evolved to their current state through , for example , tidal interactions with the galaxy ?",

    "the number of stars and drives the sc fits , but the peak in the 2.5 - 4 gyr bin is equally significant . for the old stars the metallicity",
    "is found to be close to [ fe / h]=-2 , while the younger stars have metallicities around [ fe / h]=-1.5 .",
    "it should be noted that the young population found here is not caused by the algorithm attempting to fit bhb stars , as is the case for m15 in figure [ fig : gcsfh ] .",
    "stars belonging to this young population only appear in the regions of the cmd where the rgb and the red part of the hb are located .",

    "furthermore , @xcite note the presence of a carbon star very close to the center of cvn i and its heliocentric radial velocity of 36@xmath3320 km / s is consistent with the radial velocities that @xcite and @xcite measure for cvn i , making it is likely that this star belongs to the cvn i dwarf . since carbon stars are often of intermediate age ,",
    "this is another indication of the presence of an intermediate age population in this system .    _",
    "cvn ii._ although very faint and distant , our distance measurement for cvn ii is very accurate and in very good agreement with the value from @xcite due to the presence of hb stars . from the extension of the hb to very blue colors ( @xmath45 )",
    "we can infer that the stellar population is both old and metal - poor . despite the sparseness of the cmd we thus get relatively good constraints on these parameters and we find a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 2 and a very high age .",
    "cvn ii thus appears to be a very old and metal - poor object .    _",
    "com._ an absence of a clear hb makes constraining the distance of com difficult and leads to a strong degeneracy between age , distance and metallicity .",
    "similar degeneracies occur for artificial cmd 1 in section [ subsec : fakegc ] and the gc ngc 6229 ( see figures [ fig : fakescfit ] and [ fig : gcsfh ] ) , even though their cmds are much less sparsely populated .",
    "the rgb and msto alone do not allow a robust determination of the individual population parameters . as a consequence ,",

    "our distance modulus of 20.4@xmath330.2 , which largely is determined by the hb , is somewhat lower than estimated by @xcite , but is consistent within the error bars .",

    "even though the region of parameter space that lies within 1 @xmath8 of the best fit values is well constrained , the complete parameter space lies within 2 @xmath8 , which is due to the low s / n of the cmd .",

    ", the fit results imply an old population ( @xmath1410 gyr ) with an intermediate to low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 1.6 ) , but also here the error bars on these numbers are large .",
    "figure [ fig : nssummary ] summarizes our results from the match fits to the cmds for the sample of new milky way satellites . in the left panel",
    "we plot our metallicity estimates for all objects versus their absolute magnitudes , together with the spectroscopic metallicities from @xcite and @xcite . especially for the fainter objects our metallicity estimates are very poorly constrained ( figures [ fig : nsscfit1 ] and [ fig : nsscfit2 ] ) and because of the available isochrones our metallicity range is restricted to [ fe / h]@xmath132.4 at the metal - poor end . in light of this ,",
    "our photometric results agree remarkably well with the spectroscopic values .",
    "still , care has to be taken when drawing conclusions from these metallicity estimates .",
    "we can say at best that we find no indication for a corellation between metallicity and the luminosity of the objects , which is observed for brighter dwarf spheroidals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mean age of the stars versus absolute magnitude is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : nssummary ] . for objects in which the sfh fits",
    "showed evidence for two populations , both populations are plotted separately .",
    "the right panel shows the inferred ages of the satellites versus distance modulus , to probe possible environmental influences .",
    "looking at the middle panel of figure [ fig : nssummary ] there is no clear evidence for a luminosity dependence of the ability of a dwarf galaxy to form stars recently . although the two most luminous objects in this sample , leo t and cvn i , both have young or intermediate age populations , the much fainter uma ii does as well .",
    "while the environment might play a role , the right panel of figure [ fig : nssummary ] shows no obvious relation between age or the presence of multiple star formation epochs with distance from the sun ( since these objects are at high galactic latitude and at large distances , the heliocentric and galactocentric distances are not significantly different ) .",
    "this is contrary to the trend suggested by @xcite for the brighter local group dwarf spheroidals , in which systems with a larger fraction of young or intermediate age stars are systematically more distant .      since most of these recently detected objects are intrinsically faint and/or distant , they are of course much harder to detect by any overdensity detection scheme than the gcs .",
    "the improvement in the goodness - of - fit , @xmath41 , between a fit with a control field only and a control field plus sc model is roughly proportional to the number of stars in the cmd that can be fit by the sc model .",
    "this means that the objects with sparsely populated cmds are the most difficult to detect . comparing the overdensity detection results in figure [ fig : nsarea ] with the cmds of the objects ( figure [ fig : nscmds ] )",
    "confirms this , as boo , cvn i and uma ii give by far the highest @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the rms noise in @xmath41 increases with increasing numbers of field stars in the cmds , and at the low s / n end the noise level starts to play an important role .",
    "for example , comparing the panels for boo ii and cvn ii in figure [ fig : nsarea ] , which have the same @xmath41 scale , reveals very different noise levels .",
    "this can be traced back to the positions of these objects on the sky , with bootes ii lying behind the sagittarius stream and cvn ii in a much ` cleaner ' region of the halo .",
    "the sagittarius stream also produces a high noise level around segue 1 .    while most objects produce clear peaks in @xmath41 , the detectability of several is rather low . for example",
    ", cvn ii , leo t , segue 1 and uma i have a @xmath41 only a factor of a few higher than the most prominent noise peaks ; boo ii is not clearly detected at all .",
    "when inspecting the values in table [ tab : detsig ] , it turns out that the use of a fine - tuned population model as compared to the generic old , metal - poor model has a varied effect . in some cases the detection significance",
    "is improved , in some cases the change has little effect and in a few cases the detectability is actually decreased . in these last cases , even though the peak @xmath41 is the same to or higher for the fine - tuned model , the change in the rms causes the detection to become less significant .",
    "this indicates that , while sampling a range of population models would be preferable when doing an overdensity search , a relatively small grid of models will not severely compromise the outcome .    to test the significance of the @xmath42 measure , we tested the overdensity detection scheme on a presumably ` empty ' patch of sdss sky with 170@xmath56ra@xmath56200and 40@xmath56dec@xmath5665 .",
    "this patch of sky was divided into 20@xmath1120   boxes with some overlap , giving a total of 7088 boxes , equalling an effective search area of almost 800 square degrees . a control field ( the cmd from the surounding 5@xmath115area ) was fit to the cmd of each box , as well as this control field plus a typical old stellar population model with an age bin of 10.0 to 10.1 log - year and [ fe / h]=-2 .",
    "this was done seven times , with the stellar population model shifted to different distance moduli : 17.0 , 18.0 , 19.0 , 20.0 , 21.0 , 22.0 and 23.0 magnitudes .",
    "thus , for each box seven values of @xmath42 are obtained , where the rms is obtained from the boxes in the surounding 5@xmath115 .",
    "the methodology closely resembles the approach used for the mw satellites .",
    "figure [ fig : pksig ] shows the histogram of all @xmath42 values for all boxes ( solid line ) , as well as for two individual distance moduli , 18.0 ( dotted ) and 22.0 ( dashed ) mag .",
    "all three histograms show the same distribution , implying that the noise behaves similarly for all distance moduli .",
    "the tail of the distribution extends to @xmath57 .",
    "an inspection of the locations with values higher than 7 reveals no obvious overdensities , implying that this tail is indeed caused by noise . in order to obtain a clean sample of stellar overdensity detections ,",
    "a @xmath42 threshold of @xmath149 seems appropriate .",
    "this means that when using a sufficiently sampled grid of population models and distances , all new mw satellites would be detected , with the exception of boo ii ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : detsig ] ) .",
    "the results of the fits to boo i with different box sizes , listed in table [ tab : detsig ] and shown in figure [ fig : booiareas ] , illustrate the effect of the spatial resolution of the cmd grid . here , the detectability is also strongly affected by the rms of the background noise . since the @xmath41 due to random variations in the field population increases with increasing numbers of field stars , the rms is higher for larger box sizes , favoring the smallest boxes used here .",
    "the fact that the @xmath58 decreases roughly by a factor of 2 as we move to larger box sizes is caused by the number of background stars increasing by a factor 4 , while the number of boo i stars in the central box does not change .",
    "it is also interesting to note that here the noise is dominated by the sagittarius stream , which runs accross the lower left corner of the panels in figure [ fig : booiareas ] .",
    "the significance of the detections in table [ tab : detsig ] can be boosted by decreasing the box sizes , especially for the objects with the smallest ( projected ) size .",
    "we have shown that application of match @xcite to hess diagrams or cmds of sdss data successfully recovers the known stellar population properties of globular clusters ( section [ sec : gctests ] ) , within the limitations of the data .",
    "this gives confidence that despite inaccuracies in the theoretical isochrones in isolated parts of the cmd , the overall cmd - fitting technique still provides good and trustworthy results .",
    "apart from the standard star formation history fitting method , we have also demonstrated three other ways of applying match to sdss data : + 1 ) identifying the best fitting ` single component ' stellar population , a mode useful for cmds of very faint or distant objects with limited s /",
    "n in their cmd ; + 2 ) fitting the line - of - sight distribution of stars  to keep the fit s degrees of freedom constant , we fix the metallicity at each age bin ; and + 3 ) algorithmic detection of objects , i.e. of a localized stellar population overdensity in a particular ( unknown ) direction and at a particular ( unknown ) distance .",
    "this is done by comparing the difference in the goodness - of - fit between a cmd - fit to a control field and a cmd - fit to a control field plus model population .",
    "these tests show that the application of cmd - fitting techniques to wide - field survey data is a very promising endeavor in the light of sdss and other surveys that will start yielding data over the next few years .",
    "further improvements in software and theoretical isochrones can only increase the use and accuracy of such work . on the basis of these tests and the application to known globular clusters",
    ", we have applied our single component fitting technique to twelve recently discovered milky way satellites .",
    "the sparseness of several of the cmds of these objects inhibits a robust determination of the population parameters and the best fit solutions are often not unique . in order to obtain good constraints at least some cmd features such as the msto , hb and rgb",
    "should be observed with sufficiently high s / n . for the least luminous objects",
    "this is inherently problematic because of their lack of ( evolved ) stars . for only four of the satellites ,",
    "the cmds had sufficiently high s / n to warrant a star formation history fit .",
    "the results of the population fits to the new milky way satellites , summarized in table [ tab : newresults ] , are consistent with the individual discovery and follow - up studies . when looking at the sample as a whole , we find that the majority of these objects are likely dominated by old ( @xmath59 10 gyr ) and metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 2 ) stellar populations . for boo , cvn ii , com , and",
    "her the single component fits converge to this picture , and for boo the full fit of a star formation history also confirms this .",
    "seg 1 , uma i , uma ii , and wil 1 are not well constrained by the sc fits , but using the distances from the literature as priors , they are also consistent with similar ages and metallicities , although slightly higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath311.6 ) can not be excluded .",
    "the single component fits show cvn i to be old as well , but not extremely metal - poor .",
    "however , the sfh reveals the presence of both an old , metal - poor , as well as a younger ( @xmath513 gyr ) and more metal - rich population . this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who detect two kinematically distinct populations in cvn i which differ in age and metallicity , and the detection of a young component by @xcite in deeper photometry .",
    "the sfh of uma ii also shows a peak at an age of @xmath145 gyr , which supports suggestion of multiple populations in this object by @xcite , who find the msto width of uma ii to be too large to be explained by photometric errors alone .",
    "finally , in leo t the presence of two distinct populations is readily seen in the cmd and reproduced in the star formation history .",
    "the rgb seen in this system belongs most likely to an intermediate age ( @xmath145 - 10 gyr ) population with a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 1.5 to -2 , while the blue stars in the cmd are most likely very young ( @xmath561 gyr ) blue loop stars with similar metallicities .",
    "the objects studied here are all intrinsically faint and sparse , and in some cases the population parameters can be constrained only poorly . however , their star formation histories do not appear uniform , nor do all of them appear to be exclusively old and metal poor .",

    "<S> we have tested the application to sloan digital sky survey data of the software package match , which fits color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to estimate stellar population parameters and distances . these tests on a set of six globular clusters show that these techniques recover their known properties . </S>",
    "<S> new ways of using the cmd - fitting software enable us to deal with an extended distribution of stars along the line - of - sight , to constrain the overall properties of sparsely populated objects , and to detect the presence of stellar overdensities in wide - area surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we then also apply match to cmds for twelve recently discovered milky way satellites to derive in a uniform fashion their distances , ages and metallicities . while the majority of them appear consistent with a single stellar population , cvn i , uma ii , and leo t exhibit ( from sdss data alone ) a more complex history with multiple epochs of star formation . </S>"
