    "there have been significant advancements in techniques for cooling and trapping ultracold atom gases in recent years , facilitating the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali gases ( specifically @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in 1995  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite . since then , numerous studies of these condensates have been accomplished .",
    "in addition , experiments have been conducted that have obtained boson systems in number squeezed states from ultracold gases of alkali atoms in optical traps  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is now possible to create a mesoscopic two - boson system of sodium or rubidium .",
    "individual alkali atoms from a bec reservoir can be subjected to quantum tweezers ( gaussian lasers exploiting the landau - zener tunnelling between the reservoir levels and the levels in the laser beam )  @xcite .",
    "other recent methods include number - squeezing the bec itself by `` culling '' atoms from a trapped condensate down to a sub - poissonian regime , making the number uncertainty small enough to be ignored  @xcite .",
    "a two - boson system can be subjected to a micrometer - scale double well potential using coherent laser beams .",
    "the methods that are applicable in the required length scales are overlapping cross - sections of gaussian lasers  @xcite .",
    "numerous methods can be used to control the extent of the overlap , such as an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) vibrating with two sound waves  @xcite .",
    "each sound wave causes an impinging laser beam with a gaussian cross section to bragg - diffract at an angle .",
    "the separation between the two diffracted beams can be adjusted with relative ease , and consequently so can the length scale of the double well that is generated by focussing the two diffracting beams into parallel beams ( the double well lies in the direction lateral to the propagation )  @xcite .",
    "other applicable techniques for double well generation are small volume optical traps formed by multiple lasers propagating as gaussian sheets  @xcite , and blue - detuned far - off - resonant laser light to add a potential hill in the middle of a cigar - shaped magnetic trap  @xcite .    a two - boson system , in an optical trap , can be subjected to stimulated raman scattering .",
    "as we shall show , coherent population transfer from the ground state into one of the excited states can be achieved using radiation pulses .",
    "time - modulated ( i.e pulsed ) electric fields or laser radiation pulses , applied sequentially in a counter intuitive manner , can be used to facilitate this process . if the time scale of the pulse modulation is sufficiently large , the raman process is adiabatic ( called stimulated raman adiabatic passage or stirap )  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of traditional stirap systems involves relatively weak radiation pulses and the rotating wave approximation on the three involved levels  @xcite .",
    "more recently , multilevel transitions have been performed and floquet theory has been used to tell us how the population evolves in time  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the appearence of avoided crossings contributed by resonating levels other than the ones that the radiation pulses connect .",
    "these avoided crossings in the floquet eigenphases appear due to level repulsion caused by a loss of symmetry / degeneracy ( actual crossings )  @xcite , and affect the statistical properties of the spectra , bringing them close to that predicted by random matrix theory .",
    "these are connected with the dynamics of the underlying classical system , which undergo a transition from kam tori to chaos in this region of the paramter stace  @xcite .",
    "thus , this work also demonstrates the quantum effects of chaos , induced by the radiation , on multilevel transitions in a 2-boson system .    in the following sections",
    ", we describe the behavior of two bosons in a one - dimensional double - well potential which we shall model as detailed in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we will describe the classical dynamics , where the pseudopotential interaction in one - dimension is approximated by a gaussian potential . in section 4",
    ", we will discuss the quantum eigenstates of this system and compare the quantum phase space of the eigenstates with the classical phase space . in section 5",
    ", we will proceed to describe the dynamics of excitations of this system which will be driven by two sinusoidal electric field pulses applied in sequence .",
    "the frequencies of the fields are chosen to connect specific undriven energy levels of the system .",
    "section 5.1 poses the schrdinger equation for the quantum dynamics for this system .",
    "section 5.2 introduces floquet theory and the numerical methods implemented to evaluate the floquet matrix .",
    "section 6 discusses a specific set of parameters for the general stirap dynamics discussed in section 5 . in subsections 6.1 - 6.3 , we look at the eigenvalue spectra of the floquet matrices for two amplitudes and use them to explain the actual dynamics of the system obtained from _ ab initio _ numerical solutions of schrdinger s equation with the same parameters .",
    "we repeat these numerical methods for a different set of parameters in section 7 , where the wells are slightly deeper and an additional resonance exists in the eigenvalue spectrum which affect the coherent excitations . for large pulse amplitudes , the dynamics of the stirap process is also noticeably affected by the presence of chaos in the stronger pulse amplitudes in both cases . concluding remarks are made on section 8 .",
    "our system consists of two alkali metal bosons confined to a double - well optical potential .",
    "the two bosons can be obtained from a cold - atom system confined in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) by number squeezing , followed by laser culling in an optical dipole trap ( odt ) .",
    "if the optical laser is far - detuned from the internal atomic resonances , they can be treated as point particles .",
    "the effective interaction between the bosons , in three dimensions , is obtained in the long wavelength approximation to be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is planck s constant , @xmath5 is the s - wave scattering length and @xmath6 is the displacement of the @xmath7th particle  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy eigenvalues of the two particle system are given by the schrodinger equation @xmath8   \\psi_{e_j}({\\bf x}_1 , { \\bf x}_2 ) \\\\",
    "+   \\left[v_t({\\bf x}_1)+v_t({\\bf x}_2)\\right]\\psi_{e_j}({\\bf x}_1 , { \\bf x}_2 ) \\\\   +   \\frac{4\\pi\\hbar^2 a_s}{m } \\delta^3({\\bf x}_1-{\\bf x}_2)\\psi_{e_j}({\\bf x}_1 , { \\bf x}_2 )   = e_j \\psi_{e_j}({\\bf x}_1,{\\bf x}_2 ) , \\label{eq:3dsys}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass of the particles , @xmath10 is the optical double - well potential and depends only on a single coordinate , and @xmath11 is the potential profile of the mot .",
    "@xmath12 is a symmetrized energy eigenstate of the interacting two - particle system with energy @xmath13 .",
    "the system can be confined in two spacial ( radial ) directions so that the essential dynamics occurs in the @xmath14 - direction .",
    "this can be achieved by using anisotropic magnetic traps with high aspect ratio  @xcite , where the radial trap frequencies are considerably larger than the axial frequency  @xcite . in that case , the radial part of the wavefunction is is not affected by the interaction and the energy eigenstate can be decomposed into an axial part ( along the x - axis ) and a radial part such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the noninteracting ground state of the system in the @xmath18 plane . if we assume the trap to be a radial harmonic oscillator of stiffness @xmath19 then , multiplying eq .   by @xmath20 and integrating in all radial",
    "coordinates reduces the hamiltonian to a form which describes motion along the axial direction , @xmath21 \\psi{_j}(x_1,x_2 ) = e_j \\psi_{j}(x_1,x_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and the energy @xmath13 contains contributions from the radial ground state .",
    "thus , the system is effectively one dimensional",
    ".    we will consider the case of two identical bosons confined to a quartic double well potential .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the momentum of the @xmath7th particle ( @xmath7= 1,2 ) , @xmath25 is the position of the @xmath7th particle along the x - axis , @xmath26 determines the depth of the double well potential , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 determine its spatial extent .",
    "it is useful to write the hamiltonian in terms of dimensionless parameters @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce a unit of length , @xmath30 , which ( as we will see ) is appropriate to the systems we consider here .",
    "then let @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if we now drop the primes on the dimensionless parameters , we obtain @xmath42 the unit of length , @xmath43 , is two orders of magnitude below typical length scales in double wells created with gaussian lasers  @xcite , as well as gaussian sheet lasers , or lasers diffracted off of acousto - optical modulators vibrating with two sound waves  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this length scale should be attainable in these setups . for instances , well dimensions in a double well generated using an aom are proportional to the difference between the acoustic frequencies ( typically @xmath44 mhz  @xcite ) , producing a barrier length in the micrometer range",
    ". it should be relatively straightforward to reduce that frequency difference by two orders of magnitude and adjusted it to produce a double well of a barrier length of @xmath45 , or an @xmath46 of @xmath47 , as is required here .",
    "the lifetime of the magnetic traps in these experiments is approximately @xmath48 s. if we use @xmath49rb alkali atoms as our bosons then the value of @xmath50 is about @xmath51 , making typical trap lifetimes ( about @xmath52 ) translate to @xmath53 units of @xmath50 .",
    "the characteristic energy scale @xmath54 is very small , and corresponds to photons with frequency of about @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , monochromatic coherent radiation at around this frequency is necessary for stirap excitations , and can be obtained using noble gas masers  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] shows a plot of the quartic double well @xmath56 for well depth @xmath57 .",
    "in order to study the classical dynamics of the system governed by the hamiltonian in eqn .   the contact potential @xmath58 can be replaced by a gaussian shaped potential of suitably chosen width @xmath59 such that @xmath60 we have noticed no discernable difference in the quantum case between using the gaussian for the interaction and using the delta function provided that the width of the gaussian @xmath59 is sufficiently small . too small",
    "a width generates unresolvable errors in the numerical solution to the classical dynamics and so an optimum width was chosen at @xmath61 .    in the absence of a time dependent external field ,",
    "the system is conservative , has two degrees of freedom , and energy @xmath62 is constant .",

    "energy conservation places bounds on the values of the coordinates @xmath69 so the trajectories are confined to a finite region of the phase space .",

    "the numerical integration was done by the @xmath73 order implicit runge kutta ( prince dormand ) method  @xcite using the appropriate subroutine in the gnu scientific library  @xcite .",
    "the integration was done non - adaptively , with a fixed temporal stepsize of @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : classicalpncr].a ( @xmath75 ) , we can see several regions of interest .",
    "there are three kinds of dynamics at this energy vis - a - vis the relative energies of each particle . in the case that the particles are in separate wells , trajectories exist where they do nt see each other and are therefore the same as that of a single particle in a double well .",
    "they are seen as large kam ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser ) tori around @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig : classicalpncr].a.1 .",
    "these trajectories lie between two chaotic regions .",
    "both chaotic regions are produced by the case when the energy of one particle is set to a positive value ( thus taking it above the wells ) , and the energy of the other particle is decreased so that they both add up to @xmath62 ( the particles being kept sufficiently far apart at @xmath77 so as to make the interaction negligible at that time ) . the resultant dynamics is chaotic due to the interaction experienced by the particles when they approach each other during motion .",
