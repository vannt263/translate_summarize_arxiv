    "the importance of the yang - baxter ( yb ) equation to a variety of branches in physics and mathematics is well known .",
    "its solutions are intimately related to exactly solvable statistical mechanical models , link polynomials in knot theory , quantum and classical integrable models , conformal field theories , representations of groups and algebras , quantum groups and many others .",
    "more interestingly , yb equation provides various connections among the aforementioned disciplines .",
    "historically , yb equation has its roots in the theory of exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics @xcite and the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite . for an extensive account of early work on the yb equation see @xcite . in its original form",
    "the quantum yb equation is the relation @xmath0 in @xmath1 , for a @xmath2-linear operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a vector space over a field @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath5 is meant as @xmath6 acting on the first and third factors of the tensor product @xmath7 and as identity on the second , and similarly for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "drinfeld suggested to study the simplest possible solutions of the yb equation by replacing @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where the yb equation is regarded as an equality of maps in @xmath12 for a finite set @xmath13 .",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite , this setting provides potentially new interesting solutions of the original yb equation by considering the free module generated by the set @xmath13 .",
    "various interesting examples of yb maps such as those arising from geometric crystalls @xcite , have revealed a richer structure of the underlying set ; @xmath13 is an algebraic variety and @xmath6 is a birational isomorphism . as in @xcite",
    "we refer to solutions of the yb equation in @xmath11 simply as yb maps .",
    "one has to have in mind though that yb maps through a natural coupling can be regarded as equations on the edges of graphs .",
    "one of the most distinguished properties of integrable partial differential equations is their invariance under darboux and bcklund transformations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear superposition formulae of the solutions generated by the bcklund - darboux transformations provide natural discrete versions of the continuous equations . in turn , the key transformation properties of the discrete equations are intimately related to the yb property for maps or its proper generalization in higher dimensions namely the functional tetrahedron equation .",
    "a prime example of the latter are the star - triangle transformations in electric networks and the ising model and their connection with discrete equations in the three - dimensional lattice associated with the kadomtsev  petviashvili ( kp ) hierarchy and its modifications @xcite .",
    "recent interest on solutions of the yb equation for maps has appeared in the literature .",
    "this is mainly due to the development of the dynamical theory of yb maps @xcite , and classification results of yb maps for @xmath14 , in connection to analogous results for two  dimensional integrable discrete equations on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the latter correspondence was further investigated in @xcite by exploiting the local groups of symmetry transformations of the discrete equations .",
    "it was demonstrated that an integrable quadrilateral equation with a sufficient @xmath15-parameter symmetry group gives rise to a yb map .",
    "however , there exist discrete equations which do not admit any local symmetry group .",
    "such an equation is a discrete version of the krichever - novikov ( kn ) equation @xcite , introduced by v. e. adler in @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the discrete kn equation is that the lattice parameters lay on an elliptic curve .",
    "remarkably , from the very early times exactly solvable two - dimensional models appeared in statistical mechanics it was observed that the solution of many of these models ultimately leads to the introduction of elliptic functions , such as the eight - vertex model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to investigate whether there exist also solutions of the yb equation for maps related to elliptic curves . already this problem was addressed in @xcite where a theoretical framework was introduced for deriving yb maps from factorization of matrix polynomials and @xmath16functions .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to exhibit yb maps with parameters living on elliptic curves and which are associated to integrable partial differential equations ( pde ) . in section [ sec : definitions ] we present background material on the yb maps . in section [ sec : quad ]",
    ", we present key transformation properties of integrable lattice equations , encoded into braid type equations , and give a brief account on symmetry aspects of discrete integrable equations and their usage in deriving yb maps .",
    "finally , we present a way for deriving a yb map from integrable lattice equations of certain type , without using a local symmetry group .",
    "the latter method is applied to generic integrable lattice equations associated to elliptic curves such as discrete kn equation and discrete landau ",
    "lifshits equation and the results are presented in sections [ sec : kn ] and [ sec : ll ] , respectively .",
    "the paper concludes in section [ sec : conclusions ] with various comments and perspectives .",
    "in the following we use the notation and terminology introduced in @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be an algebraic variety , and @xmath17 a birational isomorphism .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the map acting as @xmath6 on the components @xmath19 of the @xmath20-fold cartesian product @xmath21 and as the identity on all others .",
    "more explicitly , for @xmath22 let us write @xmath23 then , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 the map @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 in particular , for @xmath29 we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the latter map is @xmath6 conjugated by the permutation map @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34    \\(i ) the map @xmath6 is called a yb map if @xmath6 satisfies the yb equation @xmath35 regarded as an equality of maps of @xmath12 into itself .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath6 is called reversible , or unitary , if it satisfies the condition @xmath36",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath6 is called non - degenerate if the maps from @xmath13 into itself defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 are bijective rational maps for any fixed @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .    a schematic representation of the yb equation is given by the two decompositions of an elementary @xmath41-cube as depicted in figure [ fig:3dyb ] .",
    "the composition of maps in the lhs and rhs of the yb equation ( [ eq : ybrel ] ) are given by @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the yb equation guarantees that the images of @xmath43 under the two composition of maps in ( [ eq:3dybinter ] ) are identical , thus the two parts of the @xmath41-cube can be glued together .        defining @xmath44 the yb equation ( [ eq : ybrel ] ) for @xmath6 translates to the braid equation @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the unitarity condition ( [ eq : unit ] ) , in view of ( [ eq : r21 ] ) , takes the form @xmath47 and @xmath46 is said to be an involution .      instead of a single map one may consider a whole family of yb maps parametrized by two continuous parameters @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an algebraic set in @xmath50 .",
    "the yb relation then takes the parameter - dependent form @xmath51 and the unitarity ( reversibility ) condition becomes @xmath52 in the following we drop the dependence on the parameters and write just @xmath6 for a two - parameter yb map , since we always consider maps of this type .",
    "let @xmath53 be a two - parameter family of @xmath54 matrices depending on @xmath55 and polynomially / rationally on the coordinates of @xmath56 .",
    "the following notion of lax matrix for a yb map was introduced in @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath57 is called a lax matrix of the yb map @xmath6 , if the relation @xmath58 implies that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath57 is called a strong lax matrix of @xmath6 , if the converse also holds .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath57 satisfies the @xmath20-factorization property if the identity @xmath61 over @xmath49 , implies that @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "[ rem : nfact ] the @xmath64-factorization property of @xmath65 corresponds to the unitarity property of @xmath6 , while the @xmath41-factorization property to the yb property .",
    "indeed , the composition of maps @xmath66 is represented by the matrix factorization @xmath67 evidently , the unitary property of @xmath6 is equivalent to the @xmath64-factorization property of @xmath65 . on the other hand , the cubic representation of the yb relation ( see figure [ fig:3dyb ] ) suggests to consider the product @xmath68 it can be factorized in two different ways , according to the composition of maps in ( [ eq:3dybinter ] ) , i.e. @xmath69 @xmath70 where we have used the fact that @xmath65 is a lax matrix for @xmath6 in each face of the cube and the associativity of matrix multiplication .",
    "thus , the yb property of @xmath6 is equivalent to the @xmath41-factorization property of @xmath65 .    consider the map @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 introduced in @xcite .",
    "the above map admits the lax matrix @xmath73\\,.\\ ] ] it is straightforward to check that the discrete zero curvature equation ( [ eq:2-fact ] ) , implies the map ( [ eq : f3map ] ) .",
    "conversely , according to @xcite a hint for considering the matrix @xmath65 of the above form , is based on the yb map itself .",
    "indeed , one notices that the second component of the map can be written as a linear fractional transformation induced by the linear transformation with matrix @xmath74 on @xmath75^t$ ] . for the above lax matrix",
    "the @xmath20-factorization property can be proved as follows .",
    "the null space of the linear transformation in the lhs of ( [ eq:3-fact ] ) , for @xmath76 , is spanned by the vector @xmath77^t$ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath78^t$ ] spans the null space of the rhs linear transformation .",
    "because of the identity ( [ eq:3-fact ] ) , we conclude that @xmath79 , and the rightmost matrices cancel out .",
    "therefore , by induction , @xmath65 satisfies the @xmath20-factorization property . the yb map ( [ eq : f3map ] ) is simply related to the @xmath80 map obtained in the recent classification @xcite for the case @xmath14 .",
    "in this section we present first braid transformation properties of integrable discrete equations defined on elementary squares .",
    "next , we briefly summarize a method for obtaining yb maps from integrable discrete equations on quad - graphs , which is based on the existence of a local group of symmetry transformations of the equations . finally , we present another method to the same end which does not prerequisite the existence of a local group of symmetry transformations .",
    "we consider discrete equations on quad - graphs given by an algebraic equation @xmath81 relating the values of a function @xmath82 assigned on the four vertices of an elementary plaquette .",
    "it is assumed that ( i ) opposite edges on the plaquette carry the same lattice parameter @xmath83 , @xmath84 and ( ii ) equation ( [ eq : quad ] ) it can be solved uniquely for each @xmath85 , say @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 in order to make contact with the special properties of the integrable discrete equations we interpret equation ( [ eq : quad ] ) as a map @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 where @xmath86 is given by ( [ eq : fgamma ] ) ( see fig .",

    ", width=151 ]    let us now define @xmath90 by @xmath91 where @xmath92 acts on the @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the @xmath95 factors of @xmath96 with parameters @xmath97 . the key properties of maps associated to integrable discrete equations on quad - graphs are the relations @xmath98 see @xcite .",
    "the first one means that each transformation @xmath99 is an involution .",
    "the second one , in view of the first , yields the following braid - type relation @xmath100    the braid relation ( [ eq : braid ] ) guarantees that the three - dimensional consistency property @xcite , @xcite , which nowadays is synonymous with the integrability of a quad - equation holds ( for a recent account on the subject we refer to the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "local symmetry groups of transformations of integrable discrete equations provide a natural way for obtaining yb maps from them .",
    "the main observation is that the variables of certain yb maps can be chosen as invariants of the symmetry group admitted by the corresponding lattice equation .",
    "the symmetry approach was exploited in @xcite , where it was also shown that all classified quatrirational yb maps , for @xmath14 , found in @xcite , can be constructed from integrable quadrilateral equations .",
    "let @xmath101 be a one - parameter group of transformations on @xmath12 , of the form @xmath102 and @xmath92 a map of @xmath12 into itself .",
    "@xmath101 is said to be a local ( lie - point ) group of symmetry transformations of the map @xmath92 if @xmath103 , for every @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath14 and consider the following map @xmath105 which is associated with the discrete kdv equation .",
    "the corresponding map @xmath99 defined by ( [ eq : dermap ] ) satisfies the braid type relation ( [ eq : braid ] ) .",
    "moreover , the map ( [ eq : quadkdv ] ) commutes with the group of translations given by @xmath106 thus , @xmath107 is a lie - point symmetry of the map ( [ eq : quadkdv ] ) .",
    "the action of @xmath107 on @xmath12 is regular with one - dimensional orbits , thus local coordinates on the set of orbits of @xmath107 are provided by the complete set of functionally independent invariants for the group action : @xmath108 projecting the map ( [ eq : quadkdv ] ) to the set of orbits of @xmath107 we obtain the map @xmath109 which satisfies the parameter braid relation ( [ eq : braidrel ] ) .",
    "thus , the map @xmath110 is a yb map , known as the adler map @xcite .",
    "the most general local group of symmetry transformations of the map ( [ eq : quadkdv ] ) is @xmath111 , generated by @xmath107 and the one - parameter subgroups @xmath112 , @xmath113 given by the group actions @xmath114 by using similar arguments one may consider the set of orbits of the subgroups @xmath112 , or @xmath113 , to obtain other yb maps from the map ( [ eq : quadkdv ] ) .",

    "local coordinates @xmath119 can be chosen by a complete set of functionally independent invariants for the group action , see e.g. theorem 3.18 in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath120 the projection of the map @xmath92 on @xmath118 .",
    "the braid property of the map @xmath46 is inherited by the braid type relation ( [ eq : braid ] ) which satisfies the map @xmath92 .",
    "this can be easily deduced from the cubic representation of the relation ( [ eq : braid ] ) ( figure [ fig : flip ] ) .",
    "it should by noted that the invariants of the group action ( yb or braid variables ) can be naturally assigned to the edges of the elementary squares instead of the vertices where the variables of the original map @xmath92 are assigned to .",
    "the existence of a symmetry group of the map @xmath92 provides us a way to obtain a yb map by using as yb variables the invariants of the group action which are naturally attached on the edges of the squares .",
    "as it was shown recently @xcite , @xcite , generic integrable quad - graph equations , such as the kn discrete equation , do not admit any local symmetry group of transformations .",
    "thus the question arises whether such equations are related to yb maps , as well .",
    "this question is answered in the affirmative in section [ sec : kn ] .",

    "specifically , we consider lattice equations where at each vertex there is a two - field @xmath119 and the defining relations on the quadrilateral are ( see figure [ fig : quad ] ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 take values in @xmath13 .",
    "this scheme of two - field quad - graph equations , although not the generic one since it does not involve all eight values of the fields , arises in the superposition formulae of bcklund transformations for two - field integrable pdes e.g. the nonlinear schrdinger system @xcite , @xcite .    ) .",
