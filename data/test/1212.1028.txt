    "the parent compounds of the high-@xmath1-temperature superconductors are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mott insulator . superconductivity ( sc )",
    "emerges when charge carries ( holes or electrons ) are doped into the @xmath2 planes . as well known that the clear electron - hole asymmetry is found in the phase diagram . for hole doped case ,",
    "the afm and superconducting phases are separated by spin glass phase .",
    "in contrast , the afm phase extends over a much wider range of doping and even coexists with sc in the electron doped cuprates@xcite . due to proximity of antiferrmagnetism and sc",
    ", it is generally believed that there exists intrinsic link between these two phases .",
    "the studies of the spin dynamics in n - type and p - type cuprates will shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "one of the most available techniques to study the spin dynamics is the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , which directly measures the magnetic excitations ( mes ) .",
    "compared with the well studied p - type cuprate@xcite , the investigations on the mes in n - type cuprates@xcite are much less due to the technical reason . a robust feature of mes in n - type cuprates , i.e. , the commensurate spin response , had been revealed by these ins measurements .",
    "the commensurability , characterized by the strongest intensity peaked at @xmath3 , covers for a wide low - energy region near the optimal doped nccoyamada - prl03 and plcco@xcite .",
    "further detecting shows that such commensurability in n - type cuprates exists for a wide doping range from the underdoping to heavy overdoping@xcite .",
    "more importantly , the commensurate mes persist well above superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 , indicating its non - superconducting origin .",
    "it gradually develops into the spin - wave - like dispersion centered around the @xmath4 point at higher energy , analogous to its undoped parent compoundwilson - nature06 .",
    "in contrast , the well known hourglass type magnetic dispersion had been discovered in the p - type cuprates , where the commensurate peak can only be found at the resonance energy .",
    "therefore , the two types of cuprates exhibit distinct spin response , indicating the intrinsic particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "theoretically , several works had been carried out to interpret the mes features of n - type cuprates . adopting the single band description with experimentally fitted parameters , krger _",
    "_ claimed that the fermiology random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach with a momentum independent ( or weakly dependent ) coulomb repulsion can not account the low - energy commensurability . their numerical results indicated that the mes in n - type case should be more incommensurate than that in p - type casekruger - prb07 .",
    "such conclusion may reveal the fact that the single band description is invalid in the n - type cuprates@xcite .",
    "_ showed that this may be improved by a strongly momentum dependent coulomb repulsion with form of @xmath5@xcite .",
    "however , such improvement is more likely originated from its sharply peaked form at @xmath6 , which can not be understood physically .",
    "using a slave - boson mean - field approach , li _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the commensurability can be established in the sc stateljx - prb03 .",
    "these above mentioned theoretical works are all based on the belief that the d - wave sc is response for the low energy commensurability .",
    "it is hard to image that the small superconducting gap can produce the wide energy range commensurability .",
    "the most important is that the commensurate phenomenon is also found in the normal state of n - type cuprates , where the d - wave sc disappears .",
    "the mes had also been discussed within the frame work of coexisting of sc and afm@xcite .",
    "commensurate me had been subsequently obtained@xcite",
    ". however , this result clearly contradicts with the stoner critition@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent ins data reveal a magnetic quantum critical point where the sc first appears , implying that the coexistence may not existmotoyama - nature07 .",
    "additionally , as we mentioned above , the commensurability also exists in the state without long - range afm order .    in this paper , we focus on the commensurate mes in the n - type cuprates near the optimal doping .",
    "its energy region is closely related the to strength of effective @xmath6-scattering .",
    "the commensurate peak disappears at magnetic resonance energy @xmath7 and develops into the spin - wave like dispersion .",
    "these features are qualitatively consistent with ins measurements .",
    "this commensurability is a normal state property , and has nothing to do with the superconductivity .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the commensurability is originated from the band splitting and fermi surface topology .",
    "therefore , the afm correlation plays key roles in the n - type cuprates .",
    "the differences of mes between the p - type and n - type cuprates are further discussed for comparison .    a spin - density wave ( sdw ) description is adopted to investigate the n - type cuprates near the optimal doping .",
    "such description is first suggested by armitage _",
    "based on the arpes measurements on @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the underlying fermi surface disappears around the hot - spot near the optimal doping , where the long - range antiferromagnetism is absent , strongly suggesting the existence of a @xmath9-scattering .",
    "further proposed an effective energy band with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for upper , and lower band , respectively)parker - prb07 , where @xmath13 is the strength of the effective @xmath14-scattering , representing the influence of the sdw . @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the inter- and intra - lattice hopping term .",
    "this description well reproduces the @xmath17 band folding and fermi surface reconstruction@xcite , and its applications on the temperature evolution of optical conductivityzimmer and the hall coefficient@xcite give qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "now , the model hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath18 where , the two sublattices @xmath19 and @xmath20 with respective fermionic operator @xmath21 and @xmath22 are introduced due to sdwexplain .",

    "the summation is restricted in the afm brillouin zone .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath28 can be obtained by the rotation transformation , with corresponding weight factor @xmath29 . here , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .    here",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the long - range afm order disappears near the optimal doping .",
    "as pointed by motoyama _",
    "_ that the neel temperature detected above @xmath32 in @xmath8 originates from the region of samples that were not fully oxygen - annealedmotoyama - nature07 .",
    "this means that the genuine long - range antiferromagnetism does not coexist with superconductivity .",
    "however , the @xmath33-dimensional afm correlation remains .",
    "unlike only several lattice - distant length in p - type cuprates@xcite , the afm correlation is about tens lattice - distance in the optimal electron - doped cuprates@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the afm correlations in the n - type cuprates is similar to the long - range afm order at least in the small scaling .",
    "therefore , using a slowly fluctuating sdw order to describe the long - range afm correlation is a considerable treatment .",
    "though present sdw description is analogous to the form in the afm phaseyqs - prb05 , the physics behind is essentially different .",
    "the spin susceptibility under random phase approximation is @xmath34 with @xmath35 is a reduced coulomb interaction due to the screening effectzhou - pla10 .",

    "the best fitted effective @xmath44 scattering strength is @xmath45 , and it will be adjusted for necessary",

    "we adopt a broaden factor @xmath47 to calculate the spin susceptibility .",

    "[ f.1 ] . in the low - energy regime below @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) , ( b ) ) , the mes are incommensurate with strong intensity at diagonal directions .",
    "simultaneously , the intensity near @xmath52 enhances gradually . in the intermediate - energy regime ,",
    "the strongest intensity locates at the @xmath52 point , leading to the the so - called commensurability ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](c ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "it maintains up to an critical energy about @xmath60 ( fig.[f.1](e ) ) , where the strongest intensity @xmath61 in the normal state can be found , and is referred as the magnetic resonance @xmath62 .",
    "the total energy range for the commensurability is approximately @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "this magnetic resonance is directly related to the fact that the real part in denominator of the rpa formula ( eq .  [ e2 ] ) reduces to zero .",
    "subsequently , it evolves into a ring - like incommensurability in the high - energy region with its radius expanding upon the further increased energy ( fig .",

    "the effective @xmath52-scattering potential is @xmath70 and the damping rate @xmath71 .",
    "all data had been renormalized by setting the strongest intensity at given @xmath72 as unit , denoted by the white lines.,width=345 ]    such features can be more clear in dispersion of the mes at high symmetry scanning lines as shown in fig .",
    "a wide energy regime with commensurability exists for all selected @xmath35 , manifesting its universal nature .",
    "the low - energy incommensurability increases slightly upon @xmath73 .",
    "hence the commensurability can not not be viewed as the overlap of two incommensurate peaks .",
    "it is an intrinsic feature of n - type cuprates .",
    "the low - energy incommensurability may be suppressed and even absent with enhanced @xmath35 .",
    "for example , when @xmath74 ( fig .  [ f.2](c ) ) , the mes are still commensurate at low enough energy .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetic resonance energy @xmath62 decreases down to @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the experimental discovered commensurability in @xmath8yamada - prl03 and @xmath77@xcite near the optimal doping is more like similar to this case .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is near the afm stability , consisting with the fact that the optimal doping is near the afm quantum critical point@xcite .    the possible energy range of commensurability is mainly determined by the effective @xmath52-scattering potential @xmath13 . for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,",
    "it is about @xmath81 .",
    "this energy range decreases down to @xmath82 when the @xmath83 .",
    "however , the realistic energy range of commensurability may be substantially reduced for strong @xmath35 due to the proximity of the afm stability .",
    "it is only @xmath75 for stronger @xmath84 . for strong enough @xmath85 at given @xmath79 , the commensurability is entirely suppressed and only the ring - like magnetic feature remains .",
    "this situation is indeed an afm state .",
    "therefore , the ring - like feature at high - energy regime in the electron - doped cuprates shares the same origin as that in their parents compounds .",
    "in fact , those theories based on the long - range afm order@xcite can not account the commensurability found in @xmath8@xcite and @xmath77@xcite due to stone instability at @xmath86@xcite , unless some special control parameter is adopted .",
    "the energy range of commensurability also depends on the broaden factor @xmath87 as comparing the data in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] and fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ( ( e ) and ( f ) ) . however , this phenomenon is still present even a small @xmath88 is adopted , which is less than the instrument resolution .",
    "hence , the commensurability is an intrinsic and universal property of the electron - doped cuprates in the normal state .    the main difference in present work from the previous theoretical investigation by krger _ _ et al.__@xcite is the influence of the afm correlation is taken into account .",
    "the sdw description take the place of the single band description , producing a splitting two - band .",
    "therefore , the commensurability is a directly result of the band - splitting .",
    "this can be also seem from the fact that commensurate energy region diminishes with the reduced @xmath13 as we shown before .",
    "as we known that the afm correlation weakens with doping@xcite . in the heavy overdoping range , the afm correlation disappears , i.e. , @xmath89 , leading to the absence of band - splitting .",
    "our results is then same as the work of krger _",
    "_ , the mes become incommensurate , consisting with ins measurements@xcite .      in the p - type cuprate , the mes exhibit the well known hourglass dispersion , the commensurate peak emerges at the single energy point @xmath90 .",
    "the underdoped p - type cuprates can also be described by the two - band description due to the opening of pseudogap@xcite , where the two bands near the antinodes are separated .",
    "why do the two types of cuprates show significant particle - hole asymmetry ? as well known that the fermi surface is an arc or hole pocket near the node point in the underdoped p - type cuprates@xcite , while it is an electron - pocket near antinodal point in the n - type cuprates even near the optimal doping as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the two bands coincides at node point in p - type cuprates , which leads to the single - point commensurability at resonance energy .",
    "furthermore , this can also interpret the commensurability exists in slightly overdoped n - type cuprates even the large - three - pieced fermi surface@xcite forms because of the band splitting at nodes .",
    "therefore , both the band splitting and fermi surface topology play the important roles in the universal commensurability in the n - type cuprates . as we stressed before , they both originate from the afm correlation . together with the previous theoretical works on the band structure@xcite and transport properties@xcite , we conclude that the afm correlation plays essential roles in the cuprates .",
    "the commensurate mes remain in the presence of superconductivity .",
    "we introduce a phenomenological bcs - like pairing term @xmath91 with standard @xmath21-wave symmetry @xmath92 .",
    "the resultant mes change little , consistent with the ins observations .",
    "therefore , the commensurability in n - type cuprate is a normal state property , and has nothing to do with sc .",
    "the commensurability had been also obtained in a single band description with d - wave superconductivity@xcite . though the d - wave pairing produces two bands .",
    "however , the superconducting gap in the optimal doped n - type cuprates is only @xmath93@xcite , too small to account for the wide energy range commensurability .",
    "it seems that the commensurability comes from the strong peaked factor @xmath94@xcite or @xmath95@xcite rather than the @xmath21-wave superconductivity in these theoretical investigations .",
    "more importantly , the commensurability is a normal state property , which can also be discovered well above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .    in conclusion , the magnetic excitations near the optimal doped",
    "n - type cuprates are studied within a spin - density wave description .",
    "the main features of magnetic excitations in the normal state are well established .",
    "our analyses clearly demonstrate that the band splitting and the fermi surface topology are the key for commensurability in n - type cuprates .",
    "this strongly suggests that the antiferromagnetic correlation plays important roles in cuprates .",
    "we emphasize that the commensurability is a normal state property , and has nothing to do with superconductivity .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the theoretical calculations and experimental data also suggests the validity of the spin - density wave description near the optimal doping where the long range antiferromagnetic order is absent .",
