    "the concept of solvent mediated interaction among colloidal particles provides an invaluable tool for the physical understanding of the behavior of complex fluids . when two hard are immersed in a molecular solvent , the simple excluded volume constraint is enough to cause an effective attraction between them driven by purely entropic effects , as shown in the seminal work by asakura and oosawa ( ao ) @xcite .",
    "the depletion mechanism has been extensively studied , mostly in hard sphere fluids @xcite , and represents a very successful paradigm for the interpretation of colloidal aggregation . according to the ao prediction , which neglects correlations ,",
    "the strength of attraction is proportional to the fluid density and its range coincides with the diameter of the solvent molecules .",
    "however , both numerical simulations and liquid state theories proved that the effective interaction acquires a remarkable structure when the density of solvent molecules is increased , due to the presence of coordination shells in liquids .",
    "attractive interactions between solvent molecules reduce particle accumulation near the walls giving rise to smoother solvent mediated forces @xcite . in the neighborhoods of the critical point of the fluid the critical casimir effect @xcite is expected to give rise to long range tails in the solvent mediated attraction between colloidal particles : the effective force between two bodies acquires the range of the correlation length of the underlying critical solvent and is described by a universal scaling law which depends on a very limited number of features ( e.g. the geometry of the bodies , the boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces , the system dimensionality ) .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon has been indeed experimentally observed by use of advanced optical techniques in a lutidine solvent close to its critical point @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed for two representative models of solvent : a fluid and a fluid of hard spheres with three attractive patches . in both cases",
    "the emergence of a long range attractive tail in the effective interaction between two large spheres immersed in the solvent is clearly visible @xcite .",
    "an enhanced rate of aggregation among colloidal particles is expected to occur as a result of critical casimir effect , and indeed also this consequence has been directly observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "these investigations suggest a novel way to control colloidal aggregation by tuning the solvent temperature .",
    "critical casimir effect is due to the confinement of order parameter fluctuations induced by the presence of external boundaries . as such",
    ", it governs the long range properties of the effective interaction , while at short range excluded volume effects are still present , providing the essential ingredient for the occurrence of the depletion phenomenon .",
    "the interplay between these two quite different physical mechanisms which act at different has not been deeply investigated .",
    "numerical simulations showed that , on approaching the critical point , the effective force indeed loses the short range oscillations due to the liquid layering near the surface of the bodies and acquires a smooth attractive form @xcite but no theoretical study of this effect has been attempted yet .",
    "more generally , a thorough investigation of the form of solvent mediated interactions in the whole phase diagram of a correlated fluid has not been performed .",
    "such a study would clarify the emergence of the long range tails in the effective interactions on approaching the critical region , as well as the coexistence of the depletion mechanism , acting at short distances , and the critical casimir effect , governing the physics at large distances .    in this paper",
    "we tackle this problem by examining the solvent mediated forces between two hard walls immersed in a hard core yukawa fluid .",
    "the theoretical investigation is performed in the region in order to exclude wetting phenomena , which deserve a separate analysis .",
    "preliminarily , we must choose the most appropriate theoretical tool for such a study : a natural choice is density functional theory ( dft ) , which proved accurate in the description of confined fluids . however , no specific implementation of dft has been investigated in the critical region and most of the liquid state theories , which provide the theoretical basis for the practical formulation of dft , give a poor description of the critical regime .",
    "in section ii we propose a weighted density approximation ( wda ) especially designed for being accurate also near the critical point .",
    "this theory is validated against other dft prescriptions as well as available numerical simulations in several states . in section iii",
    "this approach is applied to the critical region of a yukawa fluid : the density profiles and the solvent mediated force between two walls are determined by numerical minimization of the density functional .",
    "the development of long range tails in both the density profile and the effective force is quantitatively investigated , confirming the trends already shown in simulations . in section",
    "iv the universal properties of the effective interaction in the critical region are discussed .",
    "the emergence of scaling laws is investigated in the critical and regime .",
    "we also show that , within our approximate dft formulation , the critical casimir scaling function is deeply related to the universal bulk properties of the critical fluid .",
    "a simple prescription for the theoretical evaluation of the critical and casimir scaling function is compared to the numerical results and to available simulations in ising systems .",
    "section v offers some final comments ad perspectives .",
    "the purpose of this work is the investigation of the solvent mediated interaction between two planar parallel walls immersed in a classical fluid in a wide range of temperatures and densities , including the critical region . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we need an accurate description of the properties of a confined fluid .",
    "the most successful theoretical approach to study inhomogeneous systems is density functional theory @xcite .",
    "although alternative techniques , like integral equations or scaled particle theory , have been proposed @xcite , dft is generally considered to be the most accurate and versatile tool for dealing with inhomogeneous systems and has been applied in several frameworks : from the study of fluids in nanopores , to the structure of the liquid - vapor interface , to the theory of freezing ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      according to mermin",

    "hard sphere fluids are successfully described by rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) @xcite also at bulk densities close to the solid transition .",
    "even if the fmt is widely used and it its implementation is straightforward , at least for the planar geometry , rosenfeld s approximation for the excess free energy holds in principle only for fluids of purely hard particles of any shape .",
    "attractive contributions in the interparticle potential are generally added as a mean field perturbation to the reference hard sphere excess free energy functional .",
    "however , such an approach gives only qualitative predictions , particularly in the critical region , because it does not take into account correlations arising from the attractive tail of the potential . also the weighted density approximations ( wda ) by tarazona @xcite and curtin and ashcroft @xcite , whose prediction of the density profile of the hard sphere fluid are rather accurate , at least at moderate densities ,",
    "includes the effects of an attractive tail in the potential only at the mean field level .",
    "furthermore , approaches based on a truncation of the gradient expansion of the excess free energy functional , such as the square - gradient approximation , can describe only the slowly varying part of the density profile but fail in dealing with the short range structure close to the wall .    in order to describe the microscopic properties of the solvent mediated forces in the whole phase diagram of a fluid , including the liquid - vapor transition",
    ", we need an approximation of the excess free energy functional which , in the uniform limit , provides an accurate description of the homogeneous fluid both in the dense and in the critical regime .",
    "unfortunately such an implementation of dft has not been devised yet .",
    "a novel wda - based approximation for the excess free energy functional based on the hierachical reference theory of fluids @xcite will be now introduced .    according to the weighted density approximation , the excess free energy functional",
    "is expressed in terms of a weighted density @xmath12 as @xmath13=\\int \\mathrm{d}\\bm{r}\\ ,   n(\\bm{r}){\\psi}^{\\mathrm{ex } } \\bigl(\\bar{n}(\\bm{r } ) \\bigr ) , \\label{eq : wda_excfreeenergy}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the excess free energy per particle of the homogeneous system evaluated at bulk density @xmath15 and the weighted density @xmath12 is written as a local average of the density profile , in terms of an isotropic weight function @xmath16 : @xmath17 the weight function can be generally dependent on the local value of an auxiliary reference density @xmath18 and has to satisfy the normalization requirement @xmath19 to ensure that in the homogeneous limit the weighted density coincides with the actual density of the fluid .    in order to get a reliable approximation for the excess free energy functional we have to choose properly the two key ingredients which characterize our wda ansatz , namely the homogeneous free energy @xmath20 and the weight function @xmath21 .",
    "the only available microscopic liquid state theory which is able to account both for non critical and critical properties of a homogeneous fluid is the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) @xcite , which will be therefore adopted in this work for the evaluation of the excess free energy @xmath22 of the uniform fluid .",
    "although the general formalism of hrt can be applied to fluids and mixtures with arbitrary pair interactions , quantitative results for specific models require the closure of the exact hrt equations by introducing some approximation .",
    "a closure which proved remarkably accurate has been implemented in the case of a hard core yukawa ( hcy ) fluid @xcite , because the resulting hrt equations considerably simplify by use of the known solution of the ornstein - zernike equation available for this interaction .",
    "the hcy potential is defined as the sum of a pure hard core term of diameter @xmath23 and an attractive yukawa tail of inverse range",
    "@xmath24 : @xmath25 where the parameter @xmath26 , which defines the energy scale , is positive . in the following",
    "we will investigate this model taking @xmath23 and @xmath27 as the units of length and temperature respectively .",
    "having established the form of our excess functional in the homogeneous limit , we proceed with the explicit definition of @xmath10 $ ] for general density profiles .",
    "we first focus our attention on the effects of the attractive part of the potential .",
    "it is well known that its main contribution to the internal energy is given by the hartree term : this circumstance has been extensively recognized in the previous treatments , where attractive interactions were included just through such a contribution .",
    "we are therefore led to isolate this term in the excess free energy , by writing : @xmath13=\\mathcal{f}^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{r}}[n(\\bm{r})]+ \\mathcal{f}^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{h}}[n(\\bm{r } ) ] , \\label{eq : split}\\ ] ] where the hartree contribution is given by @xmath28= \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\bm{r}^\\prime\\int \\mathrm{d}\\bm{r}^{\\prime\\prime } \\ ,",

    "( [ eq : split ] ) , contains both the entropic contribution to the free energy , arising from hard core repulsion , and the correlations induced by the attractive interaction .",
    "our choice is then to use wda to represent only the part of the intrinsic free energy functional , retaining the exact description of the hartree energy : @xmath30=\\int \\mathrm{d}\\bm{r}\\ ,   n(\\bm{r}){\\psi}^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{r}}\\bigl(\\bar{n}(\\bm{r } ) \\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 the form of the weight function can be determined following the strategy put forward by tarazona @xcite , by requiring that the two particle direct correlation function reduces , in the homogeneous limit , to the known form of the underlying bulk liquid state theory which , in our case , is the direct correlation function @xmath32 predicted by hrt : @xmath33}{\\delta n(\\bm{r } )   \\delta n(\\bm{r}^\\prime)}\\right|_{n(\\bm{r})=\\rho_b }   \\hskip -5 mm & = & c(|\\bm{r}-\\bm{r}^\\prime|,{\\rho}_b)+ \\beta \\ , v_{\\mathrm{y}}(|\\bm{r}-\\bm{r}^\\prime| ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & c_{\\mathrm{r}}(|\\bm{r}-\\bm{r}^\\prime|,{\\rho}_b ) , \\label{eq_constraint_wda_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality is a definition .",
    "this constraint can be fulfilled only by a density dependent weight function . in a previous work curtin and",
    "ashcroft @xcite proposed that the weight function should depend on the local value of the weighted density itself , i.e. @xmath34 . unfortunately , even for a purely repulsive hard sphere system , this hypothesis leads to difficulties in the solution of the nonlinear differential equation for the weight function which must be imposed in order to implement the constraint ( [ eq_constraint_wda_r ] ) .",
    "this problem can be overcome choosing a position independent auxiliary density @xmath18 , as suggested by leidl and wagner @xcite . in our application of dft to the description of confined systems , we assume that the auxiliary density actually coincides with the homogeneous density at the same chemical potential ( also referred to as _ bulk density _ ) , i.e. we set @xmath35 it is straightforward to obtain from eq .",
