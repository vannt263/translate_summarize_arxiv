    "in recent work we considered the properties of cumulants of time - integrated quantities in closed quantum systems , focusing in particular on the case of the time - integrated transverse magnetisation in the quantum ising chain @xcite . the aim was to highlight the importance of time - integrated operators , as opposed to time - local ones , as appropriate observables for the characterisation of real time dynamics of many - body quantum systems .",
    "the reason is that very often many - body systems , both classical and quantum , display collective dynamical behaviour of a more complex nature that what is suggested by their structural or stationary properties .",
    "glass forming systems are a typical example of this @xcite . for",
    "such systems time - integrated observables , in particular those which are extensive in both system size and time , serve as dynamical order parameters , as their higher moments can encode the full range of dynamical fluctuations .",
    "this is essentially the idea behind full - counting statistics ( fcs ) both in mesoscopics @xcite and in quantum optics @xcite , and of the thermodynamics of trajectories formalism in stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "the main point of @xcite was to show that by considering time - integrated observables it is possible to uncover the existence of distinct `` dynamical phases '' delimited by singularities of their cumulant generating function ( cgf ) .",
    "these transitions are the closed system equivalent of the `` trajectory transitions '' of open classical and quantum systems @xcite , i.e. , singularities in the cgf of time - integrated dynamical observables indicative of far - from - gaussian behaviour of their corresponding probability distributions ( analogous to the singularities of free - energies and the non - gaussian behaviour of order parameter distributions at equilibrium phase transitions ) . for time - integrated observables of closed quantum systems",
    "there is in general no associated probability distribution , but the cgf does exist , and it can be non - analytic in the long time limit as a function of its argument ( the `` counting '' field ) @xcite .",
    "these singularities are in general extensions of static quantum phase transition points , and share many similarities with them ; for example if one quenches across these phase boundaries the echo dynamics can display `` dynamical phase transitions '' @xcite similar to the ones found for quenches across static critical points @xcite .",
    "the cgf of a time - integrated observable is obtained from the spectrum of a non - hermitian perturbation of the hamiltonian of the system @xcite . in particular , the long - time cgf is related to the complex eigenvalue of this non - hermitian hamiltonian with the largest imaginary part .",
    "singularities in the cgf then emerge due to the closing of a gap in this complex energy spectrum .",
    "recently there has been a growing interest around a special class of operators which , while non - hermitian , do have a real spectrum ( and thus could be the actual hamiltonians of physical quantum systems)@xcite . that such operators can display a real spectrum",
    "is due to an associated @xmath0-symmetry  @xcite .",
    "when this @xmath0 symmetry is broken these non - hermitian operators in general have complex eigenvalues @xcite , but when the symmetry is unbroken the spectrum is real .    in this paper",
    "we explore the connection between the cumulants of time - integrated observables of a closed quantum system and the @xmath0-symmetry properties of the non - hermitian hamiltonian from which their cgf is derived . in certain cases , and for certain observables , the non - hermitian hamiltonian can display regimes of broken and of unbroken @xmath0-symmetry , and these regimes then correspond to distinct dynamical phases of the system .",
    "we apply this analysis to study the behaviour of the time - integrated longitudinal magnetisation in the one - dimensional transverse field ising model ( tfim ) .",
    "we show that the static disordered phase of the tfim belongs to a @xmath0-symmetric regime , so that the cgf of the time - integrated magnetisation is vanishing ( implying that all its cumulants are sub - linear in time ) .",
    "in contrast the static ordered phase belongs to a regime where @xmath0 is spontaneously broken , and where the cumulants of the time - integrated magnetisation grow superlineraly with time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : theo ] we provide the necessary theoretical background , both summarizing the method of ref .",
    "@xcite for studying time - integrated observables , and briefly reviewing known results on @xmath0-symmetries in spin models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] we present a warm up example to illustrate our approach , that of the time - integrated magnetisation of a single spin system and its connection to @xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "our main results on the behaviour of the cumulants of the time - integrated longitudinal magnetisation in the tfim are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ising ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "we consider a closed quantum system which evolves unitarily under a hamiltonian @xmath1 ( note we set @xmath2 ) , and we focus on a general time - integrated dynamical observable whose moments ( and cumulants ) we are interested in : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is some static system observable , and @xmath5 is written in the heisenberg picture with @xmath6 .",
    "the cumulants of @xmath7 encode information on the dynamical fluctuations of the system . in order to obtain the cumulants , we first need to define the moment generating function ( mgf ) and its associated non - unitary evolution operator @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 where we deformed @xmath1 to a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath10 . with this modified evolution operator",
    "one can show that the mgf is given by @xcite @xmath11 from these definitions it is easy to demonstrate that the moments of @xmath7 are obtained via differentiation , @xmath12 .",
    "the cgf is given by the logarithm of the mgf , @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 indicates cumulant .",
    "these quantities define the fcs  @xcite of the observable @xmath7 in this system , where in contrast to the usual approach used in studying fcs we consider the parameter @xmath16 to be real .    to study the analytic properties of this generating function in the long - time limit it is useful to consider the scaled form of the cgf , @xmath17 for extensive systems , such as the tfim studied below , we also want to scale the function in order to define the large size limit , such that @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient also to define the `` order parameter '' @xmath19 , i.e. , the long - time average of the observable @xmath7 , per unit time , that one would obtain by controlling @xmath16 ( rather than the actual dynamical average which corresponds to when @xmath20 ) , and the associated susceptibility @xmath21 , which help to characterise the dynamical phases delimited by singularities of @xmath22 @xcite .      in standard formulations of quantum mechanics",
    "there is a strict requirement of hermiticity of the hamiltonian ( @xmath23 ) which ensures the existence of a real energy spectrum .",
    "recently , after the seminal work of bender et al .",
    "@xcite , the has been much interest in the study of non - hermitian hamiltonians which may still have a real spectrum provided they are invariant under a space - time reflection  @xcite .",
    "representing the parity operator by @xmath24 , and time reversal by @xmath25 , this space - time symmetry is called @xmath0-symmetry , and a @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonian is defined as @xmath26 the operator @xmath0 satisfies @xmath27 , and @xmath25 is an antilinear operator  @xcite .",
    "these properties , together with condition allow for a formulation of a physical theory of quantum mechanics without violating any of the original axioms .",
    "the condition ensures that the @xmath0 operator commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "a conventional @xmath0 operator acts as a combination of a spatial reflection ( say , @xmath28 ) and a time reversal , usually corresponding to complex conjugation .",
    "this operator is not linear , hence the eigenstates of @xmath1 may differ from those of @xmath0 . consider an eigenstate @xmath29 of @xmath0 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath30",
    ". using only the properties of the operators @xmath0 and @xmath25 one can readily show that @xmath31 this means that @xmath30 is a phase , and can be written as @xmath32 , with @xmath33 . if we consider that @xmath29 is also an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath1 with energy @xmath34 it is easy to show from the fact that @xmath1 and @xmath0 commute that @xmath35 as @xmath30 is nonvanishing it follows that @xmath34 is real .",
    "this conclusion breaks down when the eigenstates of @xmath0 are _ not _ the same as the eigenstates of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we say that the @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath1 is _ broken _ , and conversely we refer to the case where the spectrum is real as the _ unbroken _ case .",
    "it is important to note that the exact form of the operator @xmath0 is not important in our discussion . when examining the spectrum of a non - hermitian hamiltonian , provided",
    "there is some antilinear operator @xmath0 such that @xmath36 and eq",
    ".   holds , then the spectrum is real or complex depending on whether or not the symmetry is broken .",
    "in this section we discuss a simple single spin hamiltonian as a toy example of our approach of relating @xmath0-symmetry to cumulants of time - integrated observables .",
    "consider a single - spin system with hamiltonian @xmath37 where @xmath38 denote the usual pauli spin operators .",
    "the operator of interest is the time - integrated magnetisation in a given direction in the @xmath39 plane , i.e. , as in eq .   with @xmath40 following the prescription of sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] , the associated operator becomes @xmath41 this non - hermitian hamiltonian , discussed in a different context in ref .",
    "@xcite , has eigenvalues @xmath42 the @xmath0 operator in this case is defined as the composition of @xmath43 , and of @xmath25 , the operator indicating complex conjugation .",
    "consider first the case of the transverse magnetisation in the @xmath44 direction , i.e. , @xmath45 . in this case",
    "@xmath10 is invariant under the joint action of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalues simplify to @xmath46 provided @xmath47 , the eigenvalues are real and we are in the @xmath0 _ unbroken _ regime . in this case",
    "one can use eq .   to show that the cumulants of the time - integrated magnetisation in the @xmath44 direction oscillate in time , and",
    "are therefore sublinear at long times , as indicated by the fact that @xmath48 . when the @xmath0-symmetry is _ broken _",
    "@xcite , that is when @xmath49 , the eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair , and the mgf takes the form @xmath50 the coefficients @xmath51 are determined by the overlaps of the initial state with the eigenstates of @xmath52 . in the long - time limit",
    "the mgf is dominated by the imaginary part of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 , the choice of which depends on the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact a change of the sign of @xmath16 is equivalent to performing hermitian conjugation on @xmath52 . from eq .",
    "one can easily see in this regime the cgf will scale linearly with @xmath55 as @xmath56 , and @xmath22 will be finite .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) which shows both @xmath22 and @xmath57 as a function of @xmath16 in the case of @xmath58 : by tuning the counting field @xmath16 one may break the @xmath0-symmetry , leading to square root singularities in @xmath22 at @xmath59 .",
    "if we consider instead the time - integrated magnetisation in any direction other than @xmath44 , that is , for @xmath60 , then @xmath10 is not @xmath0-symmetric for any parameter values . in this case",
    "we are always in the regime where @xmath0-symmetry plays no role , and the eigenvalues @xmath61 form a complex conjugate pair .",
    "note that this holds for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "considering @xmath62 as a function of @xmath55 we observe the emergence of a sharp feature at @xmath63 that becomes more pronounced with increasing time .",
    "this is due to the mgf being of the form given in eq .  , and in the long - time limit the eigenvalue which dominates is determined by the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "this singularity implies that the cumulants grow faster than linear in @xmath55 .",
    "this is despite the fact that @xmath22 is non - zero and well defined : the reason is that in general the limits @xmath64 and @xmath65 do not necessarily commute .",
    "the emergence of this singularity in this parameter regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) .",
    "this simple example of the single spin system illustrates that depending on the time - integrated observable @xmath7 being counted , and on the value of the counting field @xmath16 , we can have regimes of unbroken and broken @xmath0 symmetry which in turn determine the long - time behaviour of the cumulants @xmath66 . in the next section we study a many - body problem , the tfim , and consider cumulants of the time - integrated longitudinal magnetisation",
    "in this section we consider the one - dimensional tfim . this model is a paradigmatic example of a system that exhibits a static quantum phase transition  @xcite and is described by the hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 indicate the sites of a one dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of two parts , the first is a bond operator term which seeks to align the spins ( we have set the corresponding exchange coupling to one ) .",
    "the second term is the transverse field which acts against the bond operator .",
    "this hamiltonian may be diagonalized using standard free fermion techniques  @xcite .",
    "the system has a second order static quantum phase transition at @xmath69 , where the ground state changes in a singular fashion from a ferromagnetic state at @xmath70 to a paramagnetic state elsewhere .",
    "we wish to examine the cumulants of the time integrated total longitudinal magnetisation @xmath71 .",
    "that is , the time - integrated operator @xmath7 we consider is @xmath72 where @xmath73 . as explained above , in order to obtain the cumulants of @xmath7 we need to consider the deformed hamiltonian , eq .",
    ", from which we can extract the mgf , @xmath74 this hamiltonian corresponds to a discretization of the massive yang - lee model  @xcite .",
    "its critical properties have been studied extensively in  @xcite , where a critical line in the @xmath16-@xmath75 plane was found .",
    "this curve separates two regions in the parameter space where @xmath52 possesses a real spectrum and complex spectrum .",
    "more recently @xcite the existence of these two regimes was explained analytically by analysing the appropriate @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath52 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is easy to show that the non - hermitian hamiltonian is @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "specifically , if the @xmath0 transformation is such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , that there could be regimes of both broken and unbroken @xmath0 can be seen form the following argument . under a rotation of @xmath79 around the @xmath44-axis , @xmath80 , the transformed operator , @xmath81 , is real but non - symmetric .",
    "this implies that its eigenvalues , and hence those of @xmath10 , must either be real or appear in complex conjugate pairs , and thus that @xmath0-symmetry may or may not be broken spontaneously .",
    "one is able then to diagonalize simultaneously @xmath10 and @xmath0 , and distinguish a region in which they possess the same eigenvectors ( unbroken @xmath0 regime ) , from a region in which they do not ( broken @xmath0 regime ) .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry properties of @xmath10 have a direct impact on the time - integrated longitudinal magnetisation .",
    "lets consider in particular the case where the system is in its ground state , which we denote by @xmath82 ( generalisations to other pure or mixed states is straightforward ) . in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath10",
    "the mgf reads @xmath83 where @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is an eigenvalue of @xmath52 , with associated right , @xmath86 , and left , @xmath87 , eigenvectors .",
    "since @xmath10 is non - hermitian @xmath84 may be complex , and the left and right eigenvectors may not be simply related by hermitian conjugation , @xmath88 . in terms of these eigenvectors",
    "the orthogonality and completeness relations are , respectively , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the coefficients in relate to the overlap of the eigenstates of @xmath52 with the state of the system we are considering , in this case the ground state @xmath82 , and to the fact that due to the difference between left and right eigenstates @xmath86 and @xmath91 are not in general orthogonal .    in general , at long times",
    ", an mgf like ( [ zz ] ) will be dominated by the term @xmath92 for which the imaginary part of @xmath93 is largest , provided that the overlaps @xmath94 and @xmath95 are non - zero . for the case of the time - integrated magnetisation in the tfim we know that @xmath10 is @xmath0-symmetric , and the eigenvalues are either real ( @xmath0-unbroken regime ) or all come in complex conjugate pairs ( @xmath0-broken regime ) .",
    "this means that the long - time ( scaled ) cgf will be @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the complex eigenvalue per unit spin , @xmath98 .",
    "this in turn has direct implications for the time - integrated magnetisation .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0-unbroken case the mgf is purely oscillatory , and so are all the cumulants @xmath99 .",
    "we now confirm the above scenario by numerically determining @xmath100 .",
    "we diagonalise @xmath10 for rings of @xmath101 and @xmath102 spins . from eq .",
    "we can obtain the associated ( scaled ) long - time cgf .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) shows @xmath100 in the @xmath103-plane . even for these relatively small system sizes we find that there is a clear change of behaviour depending on the value of the transverse field @xmath75 . for @xmath104 ( static ferromagnetic phase )",
    "the cgf is non - zero for all values of @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath106 ( static paramagnetic phase ) there is a finite range of values around @xmath20 for which @xmath107 .",
    "if we take slices at values of @xmath75 in these two phases , figures  [ fig : fig2](b , c ) , we see that for @xmath106 the change from @xmath107 to @xmath108 is accompanied by a first - order jump in the order parameter @xmath109 ( and a peak in the susceptibility @xmath110 ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath104 , the behaviour is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) .",
    "the change in the behaviour of @xmath100 is manifested also in a change in the time dependence of the cumulants @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) we show the second cumulant , scaled by time and system size , @xmath111 , in both regimes : for the case @xmath106 it oscillates , and in the long time limit the scaled cumulant vanishes ; in contrast , for @xmath104 , it grows in a super - linear fashion with time , and scaled cumulant grows with time .",
    "higher order cumulants behave similarly in the two regimes .    in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath112 ,",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry breaking transition becomes sharp .",
    "this defines a curve dynamical transitions in the @xmath75-@xmath16 plane .",
    "this dynamical phase - diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , and in fact coincides with that previously found in ref .",
    "the key difference now is that this curve , previously identified as critical , in the dynamical setup we consider corresponds to a curve of first - order transitions of the long - time cgf @xmath22 .",
    "that is , at these transition points the dynamical order parameter @xmath57 changes discontinuously , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "note that these sharp changes in the dynamical features are not directly predicted just the statical properties .",
    "for example , imagine preparing the system in the ground state at two values of @xmath75 equidistant from the static critical point @xmath113 .",
    "these two states will have the same correlation length , which is determined by the distance from the quantum critical point , @xmath114 , but , as shown above , the behaviour of the cumulants of @xmath115 will be very different in these two states .     as order parameter , in terms of the transverse field @xmath75 and counting field @xmath16 .",
    "there are two dynamical phases : a `` dynamically ordered '' phase , which contains the static ordered phase of @xmath116 , where the @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath10 is broken , and as a consequence the cumulants of @xmath71 are linear or super - linear in time ; and a `` dynamically disordered '' phase , which contains the static ordered phase of @xmath117 , where @xmath0-symmetry is unbroken , and as a consequence cumulants of @xmath71 are sub - linear in time .",
    "the two phases are delimited by a curve of first - order transitions of @xmath22 corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of @xmath0-symmetry . ]",
    "we discussed the connection between the behaviour of a time - integrated observable in a closed quantum system and the possible @xmath0-symmetry of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite that defines the generating functions for moments and cumulants of this observable .",
    "we studied in particular the case of the transverse field ising model in one dimension , and considered as a dynamical observable the time - integrated longitudinal magnetisation .",
    "we showed that the associated generating functions are singular on a curve in the magnetic and counting field plane that separates regimes of distinct @xmath0-symmetry properties . in one regime @xmath0-symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken ( a regime which includes the static ferromagnetic phase ) , and cumulants of the time - integrated magnetisation grow at least linearly in time . in a second regime ( which includes the static paramagnetic phase ) , @xmath0-symmetry is unbroken , and cumulants are sublinear in time .",
    "we focussed here on the tfim since its @xmath0-symmetry properties when adding an imaginary perturbation , in particular an imaginary longitudinal field , are known @xcite .",
    "but the dynamical implications of @xmath0-symmetry could possibly be more general .",
    "consider a many - body system whose hamiltonian is invariant under certain symmetry operations @xmath118 , that is , @xmath119=0 $ ] ; lets say this is a discrete @xmath120 symmetry as in the tfim case for the sake of simplicity , but one can think of more general situations as well @xcite . in general there will be a choice of system extensive operators @xmath4 which are odd under this symmetry , @xmath121 .",
    "if one then considers the time - integral of @xmath4 as a time - extensive observable , the associated non - hermitian hamiltonian will be @xmath0-symmetric , with @xmath24 given by @xmath118 , and @xmath25 by complex conjugation . as discussed above",
    ", such non - hermitian operators may display regimes of broken and unbroken @xmath0-symmetry in their spectrum @xcite , with the consequent distinct behaviour of the cumulants of the time - integrated observable .",
    "this means that there is a likelihood that strongly interacting systems , in particular those where a symmetry @xmath118 is directly related to a quantum phase transition in the ground state of @xmath1 , will display the different dynamical phases associated with the long - time dynamics of cumulants as occurs in the tfim .",
    "we find particularly interesting the fact that in the @xmath0-symmetric regime cumulants are sub - linear in time : in the case of open ( i.e.  dissipative or stochatic ) systems , such behaviour is associated to an absence of decorrelation ( since cumulants of time - integrated quantities become linear in time for times larger than the relaxation time of the time - correlations of their integrands ) .",
    "it may be that the existence of such a dynamical regime has implications for the `` thermalisation '' of certain classes of operators in closed many - body systems @xcite .",
