    "regulus ( @xmath1 leo ; hd  87901 ; hr  3982 ; hip  49669 ) is a nearby ( @xmath2 pc ; @xcite ) intermediate mass star of spectral type b7  v @xcite or b8  ivn @xcite .",
    "it is one of a number of nearby b- and a - type stars exhibiting extremely fast rotation .",
    "the very broad shape of its photospheric absorption lines indicates a projected rotational velocity of @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the full picture of its fast spin came with the first interferometric observations of regulus with the chara array optical long baseline interferometer @xcite .",
    "these observations showed that the star is rotationally flattened and gravity darkened at its equator .",
    "models of the spectrum and interferometry demonstrate that the star has a rotation period of 15.9  hr , with an equatorial velocity equal to @xmath5 of the critical velocity , where centripetal acceleration balances gravity .",
    "the fast spin of regulus is puzzling given its probable age ( @xmath6 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "stars born as fast rotators are expected to slow down relatively quickly after birth , and only again achieve rapid rotation at the conclusion of core h - burning through a redistribution of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "thus , it is surprising to find rapid rotation in regulus , a star which is still in the middle of its core h - burning stage . on the other hand ,",
    "stars that are members of interacting binaries can experience large changes in spin due to tidal interactions and mass exchange .",
    "@xcite discuss how mass transfer may lead to the spin up of the mass gainer in a large fraction of these binaries .",
    "depending on the initial separation and mass ratio , the system may merge or it may widen following mass ratio inversion , leaving the donor remnant in a large orbit that shuts down mass transfer once the donor s envelope is lost .",
    "we know of several examples of such post - mass transfer binaries with rapid rotators , including the be x - ray binaries with neutron star companions @xcite and be binaries with he - star companions @xcite .",
    "regulus does have a known wide companion ( @xmath1  leo  b at a separation of @xmath7 , which is itself a binary consisting of k2  v and m4  v pair ; @xcite ) , but this companion has far too great a separation to have ever interacted directly with regulus .",
    "there are no known closer companions , but the last significant radial velocity investigation was made in 1912  1913 by @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the results introduced by the broad and shallow appearance of the spectral lines may have discouraged other investigators , but this early work and others @xcite suggest that any velocity variations present are relatively small .",
    "however , a low mass donor remnant would probably create only a modest reflex motion in regulus , so the lack of demonstrated variability is not unexpected .",
    "we have made spectroscopic observations of regulus on many occasions over the last few years , and here we present a summary of the velocities measured in these spectra .",
    "we find that regulus is in fact a low amplitude , single - lined , spectroscopic binary , and we discuss the possible nature of the companion .",
    "table  1 lists the sources and properties of the spectra of regulus we used to measure radial velocity .",
    "the spectra from run numbers 1  8 were made by us and have moderate resolving power and good s / n ( usually better than 100 per pixel ) .",
    "these include spectra obtained with the kitt peak national observatory coud feed telescope @xcite , the czech academy of sciences ondrejov observatory telescope and heros spectrograph @xcite , and the multiple - telescope telescope at the georgia state university hard labor creek observatory @xcite .",
    "we have also obtained a number of spectra from on - line archives including the eso la silla 50 cm telescope and heros spectrograph , university of toledo ritter observatory echelle spectrograph @xcite , the elodie spectrograph of the observatoire de haute provence @xcite , the eso vlt and uves ( uves paranal observatory project , eso ddt program i d 266.d-5655 ; @xcite ) , la silla 3.6 m telescope and harps spectrograph @xcite , and la silla 2.2 m telescope and feros spectrograph @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the archival spectra included a series made within a few minutes time , and we report here the average velocity of such groups .",
    "finally , we also collected a series of 12 uv high dispersion spectra from the archive of the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue)_. all these spectra were reduced to a rectified continuum format using standard routines in iraf , and then each group was transformed onto a uniform , heliocentric wavelength grid in increments of @xmath8 .",
    "many of these observations record the red spectrum in the vicinity of h@xmath1 , and we usually removed the atmospheric telluric lines in this part of the spectrum using contemporaneous spectra of rapidly rotating a - type stars or using the atlas of atmospheric transmission made by l.  wallace , w.  livingston , and k.  hinckle ( kpno ) .",
    "the _ iue _ spectra were similarly transformed to a uniform @xmath9 grid @xcite . in prior studies of more distant o - stars",
    ", we have checked the wavelength calibration by registering the positions of interstellar lines with those in the average spectrum .",
    "regulus , however , is so close that most of the interstellar lines are too weak , and in the end we relied on the measurement of a single feature , @xmath10 , for registration , which introduces some additional scatter into our radial velocities from the _ iue _ spectra .",
    "all the radial velocities were measured using the cross - correlation method with errors estimated according to the scheme described by @xcite .",
    "all the optical spectra were cross - correlated with a synthetic model spectrum taken from the work of @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is based upon a kurucz model atmosphere for solar abundances , interpolated to @xmath11  k and @xmath12 , which are close to average values over the visible hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the model template was smoothed with a rotational broadening function to better match the actual spectrum , and in each case the model was transformed to the observed wavelength grid .",
    "unfortunately , the models of @xcite do not extend to uv wavelengths , so for the _ iue _ spectra we used a model uv template from the tlusty / synspec models of @xcite for @xmath13  k ( the lowest temperature in their grid ) and @xmath14 .",
    "the use of a different template for the uv spectra may introduce systematic differences from those obtained from the optical spectra , but these errors are probably comparable to the measurement errors ( see  3 ) .    our 168 measurements are gathered in table  2 ( given in full in the electronic version ) that lists the heliocentric julian date of mid - observation , the orbital phase (  3 ) , the radial velocity and its internal error , the observed minus calculated residual (  3 ) , and the run number corresponding the observational journal in table  1 .",
    "the range in the radial velocities is larger than that expected from measurement errors , so we searched for evidence of periodic variations using the discrete fourier transform and clean method @xcite and phase dispersion minimization @xcite . both procedures identified the presence of one significant period at @xmath15  d , with a power indicating a false alarm probability of @xmath16 that the peak results from random errors @xcite .",
    "this period is too long to be related to rotational or pulsational variations , so we assume that it results from orbital motion in a binary .",
    "we then derived the remaining orbit elements using the nonlinear , least squares fitting program of @xcite by keeping the orbital period fixed at the value given above .",
    "each measurement was assigned a weight proportional to the inverse square of the larger of the measurement error or 1  km  s@xmath4 ( to account for possible systematic errors between results from different groups of observations ) .",
    "trials with other weighting schemes gave similar results .",
    "elliptical solutions made no significant improvement in the residuals from the fit @xcite , so we adopted a circular fit .",
    "we present in table  3 the standard orbital elements where @xmath17 is the epoch of the ascending node .",
    "note that the error in @xmath17 increases to @xmath18  d when the full range in acceptable period is considered .",
    "the derived systemic velocity @xmath19 is similar to the radial velocity of @xmath1  leo  b of @xmath20 km  s@xmath4 @xcite , which strengthens the case for a physical connection in this common proper motion pair .",
    "the radial velocity curve and measurements are illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the _ iue _ measurements ( _ open circles _ ) show the largest scatter around the curve , which we think derives from errors related to registering the wavelength scale with a single interstellar line (  2 ) .",
    "most of the residuals for the optical spectra have a size comparable to the measurement errors and are mainly free from systematic trends . however , several of the runs that recorded the red spectrum around h@xmath1 do have residuals that are systematically low ( see run @xmath21 ) .",
    "we suspect that these trends are due to subtle differences in data treatment , but because these specific runs cover only a limited part of the orbital cycle , we did not apply any corrections for systematic differences .",
    "the orbital variation has a small semiamplitude that eluded detection in earlier studies .",
    "consequently , the derived mass function is also small ( table  3 ) , and we show in figure  2 the constraints on the possible masses from the mass function . @xcite used model fits to derive a probable mass of the primary star of @xmath22 , and the boundaries of this range are indicated by the vertical dotted lines .",
    "larger orbital inclinations are favored for random orientations , and it is possible that the orbital inclination is comparable to the spin inclination of regulus , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass of the companion may be close to the minimum mass shown ( for @xmath24 ) of @xmath25 .    a companion this small may be a low mass white dwarf or main sequence star . if regulus was spun up by mass transfer in an interacting binary , then the remnant of the donor star is probably a low mass white dwarf @xcite .",
    "indeed , the lowest mass white dwarfs are usually found in binary systems @xcite where they lost a significant fraction of their mass , and some reach masses as low as @xmath26 @xcite",
    ". models by @xcite for mass transfer during h - shell burning ( their `` evolutionary channel 1 '' ) often lead to remnant and gainer masses and orbital periods similar to the case of regulus .",
    "since regulus and its wider companion @xmath1  leo  b are not too old ( @xmath27 myr ; @xcite ) , a white dwarf companion would not have progressed too far along its cooling track and would probably have an effective temperature @xmath28  k @xcite , much higher than that of the primary b7  v star .",
    "consequently , we might expect to observe a modest fuv flux excess if the companion is a white dwarf , and , in fact , @xcite find that the spectral energy distribution of regulus is about a factor of two brighter in the 1000  1200    range than predicted by model atmospheres for a single b7  v star .",
    "we note for completeness that a neutron star companion is probably ruled out because it would require a very small inclination ( see fig .  2 ) and an unlikely evolutionary scenario in which only a modest amount of mass transfer occurred before the supernova explosion ( no more than the present mass of the primary ) .",
    "on the other hand , the companion could be a low mass , main sequence star ( making regulus one of the most extreme mass ratio binaries among the massive stars after exclusion of the massive x - ray binaries ) . adopting the minimum mass",
    ", the companion would be an m4  v star that would be too faint to alter significantly the spectral energy distribution from that for the primary alone ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is very unlikely that the companion is the outer component of a once compact triple system .",
    "if the fast spin of regulus is the result of prior mass transfer , then an m4  v star in the orbit we find would have been too close to the central binary for orbital stability ( and would have likely been ejected or become a merger product ) .",
    "thus , in binary models for rapid rotation , the companion can not be a low mass main sequence star but must be the remnant of the donor .",
    "the angular separation of the binary is probably small .",
    "if we assume masses of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then according to kepler s third law , the semimajor axis is 0.35  au .",
    "thus , for a distance of 24.3  pc , the maximum angular separation will be approximately 15 mas , too small for detection by speckle interferometric or adaptive optics techniques .",
    "the binary could be resolved in principle by lunar occultation methods or optical long baseline interferometry , but the fact that there is no evidence of a binary from these methods is consistent with the expected faintness of the companion @xcite .",
    "for example , the magnitude difference in the @xmath31-band is probably close to @xmath32 and 6 mag for the cases of a white dwarf and an m4  v star companion , respectively .",
    "thus , the flux of the companion has no influence on the analysis of the interferometry presented by @xcite .",
    "our study has led to the discovery of a binary companion to the twenty second brightest star in the sky , and it may , like sirius , offer another example of a bright star that is orbited by a faint white dwarf .",
    "if the companion is a white dwarf , then it may be the closest case of a star stripped to its core by mass transfer in a close binary .",
    "the best opportunity to test the white dwarf hypothesis will come from very short wavelength observations where a hot companion may outshine the b7  v primary .",
    "we thank the staff of kitt peak national observatory for their support in obtaining these observations .",
    "this work is partially based on spectral data retrieved from the elodie archive at observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) .",
