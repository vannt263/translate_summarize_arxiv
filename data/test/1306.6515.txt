    "quantum chromodynamics , the theory describing the interactions of quarks and gluons , has been shown to provide excellent descriptions of a wide variety of phenomena ranging from hadron spectroscopy via lattice field theory to hard scattering phenomena via perturbation theory .",
    "yet qcd is a theory whose degrees of freedom are the quarks and gluons  quanta that can not be observed directly due to their confinement in hadrons . on the other hand , experiments deal with hadrons and leptons . in order to calculate observables measured in high energy scattering",
    "processes a technique is needed that allows conversion from a description in terms of hadrons to one in terms of quarks and gluons ( collectively referred to as partons ) . for hadrons in the initial state",
    "this conversion is provided by parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , while for final state hadrons a similar role is played by parton fragmentation functions .",
    "the pdfs , denoted by @xmath0 , for each type of quark and antiquark and for the gluon ( @xmath1 ) , allow one to essentially describe a beam of hadrons as an effective beam of quarks and gluons .",
    "in the infinite momentum frame , the pdfs can be interpreted as probability densities describing how the parent hadron s momentum is shared amongst the different types of partons , as a function of the hadron s momentum fraction @xmath2 . with knowledge of the pdfs and the feynman rules for qcd",
    ", one can calculate hard scattering cross sections and differential distributions that can then be compared to data .",
    "pdfs are traditionally determined by simultaneously fitting a wide variety of data for large momentum transfer processes .",
    "the parameters of the fits describe the pdfs at some initial momentum transfer scale , while evolution equations are then used to calculate the pdfs at all other scales needed for the calculations .",
    "the data sets used for such fits often include deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of charged leptons on proton and deuterium targets , or neutrinos on heavy nuclear targets , lepton pair production on proton and deuterium targets , and the production of photons , vector bosons , or jets at large values of transverse momentum .",
    "while the pdfs provide us with a detailed description of the partonic substructure of hadrons , they contain only partial information .",
    "partons ( both quarks and gluons ) have nonzero spin , so that the fundamental distributions in nature are the pdfs for a specific helicity ( spin projection along the direction of motion ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , corresponding to parton spins aligned and antialigned with that of the hadron , respectively .",
    "experiments with unpolarized beams and targets are therefore sensitive only to the sums of the helicity pdfs , @xmath5 , while information on the differences , @xmath6 , can be obtained from measurements involving polarized beams and/or targets .",
    "it is the purpose of this topical review to give a current `` snapshot '' of the status of our knowledge of pdfs , both unpolarized and polarized . to this end",
    ", brief reviews of both the theory and the types of data used in the fits will be presented , and theoretical issues that need to be addressed in the perturbative calculations will be outlined . throughout this review",
    "we shall attempt to answer the question `` what do we know and how do we know it ? ''",
    "recently there have been several excellent reviews of pdfs @xcite , updating the early treatises of pdfs in refs .",
    "@xcite , which have focused on various aspects of unpolarized pdfs , such as the impact on the phenomenology of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the spin structure of the nucleon , including spin - dependent pdfs , was also reviewed in refs .",
    "the present pedagogical review should be viewed as complementary to these efforts , emphasizing the different aspects of hadron structure that can be revealed through the study of unpolarized and polarized pdfs , at both small and large parton momentum fractions @xmath2 .",
    "there is an old saying in experimental particle physics that `` today s discovery is tomorrow s calibration . ''",
    "a similar effect occurs for theoretical calculations .",
    "what was once touted as a test of qcd , now often plays the role of providing a description of backgrounds for searches for new types of particles . of course , one wants these calculations to be as accurate as possible and this , in turn , requires precise knowledge of the pdfs that enter into the calculation .",
    "the error estimates on pdfs will be discussed at some length for this reason . on the other hand , there are many aspects of hadron structure that are currently not understood well , or at all , either theoretically or experimentally , and clearly identifying and delineating the limits of our knowledge in the context of global pdf fits serves a valuable purpose .",
    "the plan of the review is as follows .",
    "sec .  2 contains an overview of the necessary qcd theory required to understand the results of global fits .",
    "sec .  3 contains the review of unpolarized pdfs , while sec .",
    "4 summarizes the status of polarized pdfs .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "5 provides some speculations as to how our knowledge of pdfs may be improved through anticipated results of ongoing and future experiments .",

    "hadron processes . the cross section for a typical hadron  hadron process involving collisions of hadrons @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , producing a state @xmath11 in addition to other hadrons ( collectively denoted by @xmath12 ) , can be written in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes an @xmath15-th order parton ",

    "finally , there will be collinear singularities associated with , in this case , the initial partons emitting additional partons at zero angle .",
    "these collinear configurations correspond to internal propagators going on - shell and , as such , correspond to long - distance physics .",
    "such singular terms can be _",

    "( [ eq : xsec ] ) , the partonic hard scattering cross section can be expanded in powers of the running coupling .",
    "the dependence on @xmath24 that enters via the running coupling cancels that which appears in the partonic cross sections .",
    "similarly , the dependence on @xmath25 in the pdfs cancels against the @xmath25 dependence in the partonic cross sections .",
    "these cancellations represent the fact that the physical cross section , if calculated to all orders in perturbation theory , should not depend on the two scales introduced to control the ultraviolet and collinear singularities .",
    "however , at any fixed order in perturbation theory these cancellations will only be approximate .",
    "indeed , at order @xmath26 one has the relations @xmath27 these results suggest that the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scale choices will decrease as one carries out the perturbative calculations to higher order .",
    "this is indeed the case for the processes typically used in global fits for pdfs .",
    "( if a new kinematic configuration opens up at a higher order , then the corrections at that order can be large .",

    "these processes are all known to at least nlo and some to nnlo , as will be discussed below . in principle , the two scales @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be chosen independently . however , in processes where there is one large scale characterizing the hard scattering it is often the case that the choice @xmath28 is used .",
    "this simplifying choice will be utilized in the results discussed in the sections to follow .",
    "the dependence on the renormalization scale of the running coupling is governed by the qcd @xmath29 function via the renormalization group equation , @xmath30 the qcd @xmath29 function is calculable in perturbation theory and can be written as @xmath31 where the coefficients for @xmath32 flavors are @xmath33 the strong coupling @xmath34 calculated using the expression for @xmath29 in eq .",

    "this behavior is essential for the applicability of perturbation theory for hard scattering processes .      in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec ] ) both the pdfs and the partonic cross sections depend on the factorization scale @xmath25 .",
    "as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale ] ) , this scale dependence cancels up to the order of perturbation theory used .",
    "this fact allows one to calculate the @xmath41 dependence of the pdfs .",
    "indeed , the singularities associated with collinear parton emission are universal and factorize from the hard scattering subprocesses .",
    "the factorization scale dependence of the parton distributions is then also universal , reflecting the independence of physical quantities on the scale @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to the @xmath40 evolution , or renormalization group equations ( rge ) , @xmath42 where the bjorken @xmath2 variable is ( related to ) the longitudinal momentum fraction of the partons .",

    "another aspect of these calculations is the mass definition used ; while the original calculations of the amplitudes employ the pole mass definition , it has been reported @xcite that the use of the running mass definition improves the stability of the perturbative series .    in many situations calculations within the ( fully massive ) ffns scheme become unduly complicated , and in many cases",
    "even impossible due to the unknown massive ( @xmath157 ) matrix elements at nnlo or even nlo .",
    "for this reason it is common to generate parton distributions in the so - called `` variable flavor number scheme '' ( vfns ) , where the heavy quarks are also considered to be massless constituents of the nucleon . here , the required nlo and nnlo cross sections have been computed for a variety of important production processes , in particular at hadron colliders . in the vfns scheme the effective heavy quark distributions",

    "one proceeds to their renormalization group evolution with an increased number of flavors @xmath159 and ( eventually ) 6 .    for situations where the ( threshold ) invariant mass of the produced system far exceeds the mass of the interacting heavy flavor in the ffns , the vfns predictions",
    "have been shown @xcite to deviate from the ffns typically by about 10% , although the exact amount depends on the particular process and energy scale .",
    "this is usually within the margins of the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties and other theoretical ambiguities related to pdfs .",
    "eventually , one nevertheless has to _ assume _ that these massless `` heavy '' quark distributions are relevant asymptotically , in that they can correctly describe the relevant cross sections at scales much larger than the heavy quark masses involved .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case for dis structure functions , for which the strictly massless approach , known in this context as the zero  mass vfns , or zm - vfns , is well known to be experimentally inadequate , particularly near the heavy quark production thresholds . to remedy this the heavy - quark mass effects are re  inserted in what are known as general - mass vfnss ( gm - vfns ) , for which several prescriptions are available in the literature @xcite",
    "( see also ref .",
    "these schemes interpolate ( in a model - dependent way ) between the ffns results near production threshold and the asymptotic results of the zm - vfns .",
    "however , since the interpolating schemes are based on the same massive matrix elements as the ffns , they do not have complete information on the @xmath160 heavy flavor wilson coefficients ( even though they are sometimes referred to as `` nnlo gm - vfnss '' ) .",
    "the importance for global pdf analysis of finite heavy quark mass effects in the calculation of dis structure functions had been previously emphasized in refs .",

    "most importantly , the resulting leading twist pdfs fits have proved to be very stable even when such low cuts have been applied @xcite .    with the inclusion of the kinematic regions in which subleading @xmath178 effects play a non - negligible role , it is obviously crucial to account for the power corrections that might otherwise obfuscate the leading twist pdfs . among the different categories of @xmath178 effects , the simplest are the target mass corrections ( tmcs ) , which are formally associated with matrix elements of leading twist operators @xcite and are of kinematical origin .",
    "others include genuine higher twist corrections , which arise from dynamical , multi - parton correlations , as well as higher order perturbative qcd corrections , which can also resemble power suppressed contributions at low @xmath40 .",

    "pdfs are an essential ingredient for producing predictions for processes in high energy experiments .",
    "the uncertainties in these predictions depend , in part , on how well determined the pdfs are themselves .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the predictions that are compared to data are convolutions of pdfs with partonic hard scattering cross sections .",

    "* scale dependence : the perturbative predictions depend to some extent on the choices made for the renormalization and factorization scales for each process .",

    "thus , information from data types not included in the global fits ( such as data from @xmath237 processes ) provides valid constraints on the value of the coupling and are included in determining the global average . on the other hand",
    ", fitting the value of the strong coupling and comparing it to the global average provides an interesting consistency check on the description of the data provided by qcd .",

    "extensive efforts are made to choose flexible parametrizations which are well - constrained by data , but there is no control over the behavior outside the kinematic region covered by the data .",
    "this can lead to different extrapolations at very large or very small values of @xmath2 .",
    "a method for estimating this remaining uncertainty has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    of all these sources of error ,",
    "the easiest to treat is the first  the propagation of the experimental errors .",
    "the hessian method is described in detail in ref .",
    "the elements of the hessian matrix are given by @xmath238 where @xmath239 denotes the @xmath240 pdf parameter .",
    "the hessian matrix is generated during the actual minimization procedure and its inverse is the error matrix .",
    "the eigenvectors of the error matrix can then be used to define eigenvector parameter sets which , in turn , can be used to calculate error bands for the pdfs or for specific processes .",
    "one particular subtlety is that the error bands generally depend on a @xmath189 tolerance .",
    "mathematically , one expects the @xmath241 parameter errors to correspond to an increase of @xmath189 by one unit from the minimum value .",
    "however , it has been suggested @xcite that inconsistencies between different data sets may require a larger value to be used .",
    "this `` @xmath189 tolerance '' varies between groups and allowance must be made for this when comparing the resulting error bands .",

    "let @xmath242 denote the @xmath189 for the global data set .",

    "an alternative to the usual linear propagation of errors ( hessian method ) which can be useful for minima that are not well behaved or defined , is the so  called monte carlo method . in order to propagate the experimental errors a number of ` replica '",
    "data sets are generated by using random numbers and the original errors to generate new data points @xcite .",
    "these replica data sets are then fitted and the resulting replica pdf sets are treated using standard statistics ; the central values are given by the average over replicas , and the uncertainties by the envelope of predictions .",
    "the main motivation for pursuing global fitting as a technique for determining pdfs is that the use of a wide range of data types with different kinematic coverage places many constraints simultaneously on the pdfs .",
    "each type of observable depends on a particular linear combination of pdfs or products of pdfs .",
    "obtaining the best fit to all of the observables simultaneously has proven to be an efficient method for extracting pdfs .",

    "the experiment will further enable a study of the effects of nuclear binding on the sea quark pdfs .",
    "there is also the possibility of follow - on measurements of lepton pair production at the nuclear and particle physics facility at j - parc @xcite in japan .",

    "another avenue to explore will be parity - violating dis on a deuterium target @xcite , for which the parity - violating asymmetry arising from @xmath533 interference is expected to be independent of hadronic structure at large @xmath2 in the absence of csv effects @xcite . beyond searches for csv effects ,",
    "a program of parity - violating dis studies at the 12  gev jefferson lab @xcite could open up a new window on the vector @xmath534 interference structure functions , as well as provide glimpses into the parity - odd @xmath535 structure function .    for heavier quarks , the issue of intrinsic charm will require measuring the charm structure function at large values of @xmath2 , which may be possible at a future electron - ion collider facility @xcite .",

    "this should help answer long - standing questions about the behavior of the @xmath538 ratios as @xmath165 , and reveal insights into the role of quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon .",

    "is neverthess important to pin down , as it allows a portal to nonperturbative qcd effects in the nucleon .",
    "improved constraints on kaon fragmentation functions should lead to more reliable determinations of @xmath296 in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "finally , the polarized gluon distribution is being actively investigated in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic hadron production at compass , and through double - spin asymmetries for pion and jet production in polarized @xmath134 collisions at rhic .",

    "on the theory front , continued progress on nnlo calculations will eventually result in global fits where all the processes are treated consistently at nnlo , for both unpolarized and polarized observables .",
    "the increased precision and decreased scale dependence will help to reduce the uncertainty bands on the pdfs .",
    "the parametrization dependence of global fits will continue to be explored , allowing for greater flexibility and reducing bias introduced with the use of specific forms , such as for the @xmath145 ratio at large @xmath2 .",

    "progress on computing moments of pdfs in lattice qcd is also anticipated , with more reliable simulations performed on larger lattice volumes and at quark masses near the physical limit .",
