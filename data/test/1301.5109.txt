    "wyner and ziv @xcite , we study a setting where a sequence generated by a source is to be described succinctly to a reconstructor ( `` decoder '' ) with access to some side information .",
    "wyner and ziv showed that , although the side information is not available at the describing terminal ( `` encoder '' ) , it can be beneficial in improving the trade - off between the rate of description and the reconstruction distortion .",
    "they fully characterized this trade - off for memoryless sources with single - letter distortion measures . unlike the case without side information",
    " since the side information is used in the reconstruction process , and since the side information is not available at the describing terminal  the describing terminal can not tell how the source sequence it observes will be reconstructed . in some settings , this is unacceptable .",
    "steinberg @xcite therefore studied the common - reconstruction problem where an additional restriction is imposed that the reconstruction sequence be computable with probability nearly one at the describing terminal .",
    "this greatly limits the extent by which the reconstruction can depend on the side information .",
    "more generally , there is a tension between the degree by which the reconstructing terminal utilizes the side information and the precision with which the describing terminal can compute the reconstruction sequence .",
    "it is this tension that we study in this paper .",

    "we then study the distortions that can be simultaneously achieved at the describing terminal (  the encoder distortion  ) and at the reconstructing terminal (  the decoder distortion  ) as a function of the description rate .",
    "if the encoder s distortion function is the hamming distance and if the allowed distortion is zero , then our problem reduces in essence to steinberg s common - reconstruction problem . in section  [ sec : related ] ahead . ] and if the allowed encoder distortion is infinite , our problem reduces to wyner and ziv s problem",
    ". we can thus view our problem as a generalization of the wyner - ziv problem and steinberg s common reconstruction problem .    for discrete memoryless sources and finite single - letter distortion functions , we provide a single - letter characterization of the trade - off between the description rate and the distortions at the encoder and decoder sides .",
    "we also calculate this trade - off for a memoryless gaussian source and squared - error distortion functions . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : kdistortions ] , we generalize the results to account for more than two constraints and to allow each distortion function to depend on three arguments : the source symbol , the encoder s reconstruction symbol , and the decoder s reconstruction symbol .",
    "steinberg s work was also extended in other ways .",
    "kittichokechai , oechtering , and skoglund @xcite determined the rate - distortion function under a common - reconstruction constraint for a modified wyner - ziv setup where the encoder can influence the decoder s side information via an action - generator .",
    "timo , grant , and kramer @xcite , @xcite and ahmadi , tandon , simeone , and poor @xcite , @xcite derived the rate - distortions function under a common - reconstruction constraint for two special cases of the heegard - berger / kaspi problem ( the wyner - ziv problem with two decoders ) : @xcite , @xcite for physically degraded side informations , and @xcite , @xcite for complementary side informations .",
    "ahmadi , tandon , simeone , and poor @xcite , @xcite also presented the rates - distortions function under a common - reconstruction constraint for a cascade source - coding problem when the side informations are physically degraded .",
    "finally , already in  @xcite , steinberg studied the implications of the common - reconstruction constraint on the simultaneous transmission of data and state and on joint source - channel coding for the degraded broadcast channel .",
