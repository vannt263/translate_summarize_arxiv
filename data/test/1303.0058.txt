    "it has been shown that a cooperative communication can provide more reliable communication by reducing the error probability , while the required power remains the same .",
    "the concept of cooperation in the communication has a long history going back to @xcite where an information theoretic aspect view of cooperative communication in a multiple access channel ( mac ) is defined .",
    "although this work was based on the concept of feedback , it can be seen as a beginning of the notion of cooperation in communication .",
    "this concept have then been further extended in the information theoretic framework in several seminal works in @xcite .",
    "the initial spark started in  @xcite then lead to a fundamental context of network coding ( nc ) , as a method for achieving capacity of wired networks , introduced in 2000  @xcite .",
    "thereafter , there have been a vast number of researches on this idea where different advantages of using nc have been addressed .",
    "owing to the cooperative nature of network coding , in @xcite , it was shown that using nc over a wireless network can provide diversity , where it is called cooperative diversity in nc , similar to its previous counterparts @xcite .",
    "it then lead the researchers in wireless communication also to become interested in nc , either in ad - hoc or cellular networks @xcite . moreover , implementing nc , as an alternative method of routing , in which the nodes in the network process their received packets , can help to increase the multiplexing gain of such networks .",
    "a very simple example of a cooperative system is a multiple access relay channel ( marc ) .",
    "although there is no direct cooperation between the users , sharing the relay node can be seen as a cooperative behavior .",
    "a relay node can be utilized conventionally , where at each time slot the relay only serves for one of the users . on the other hand ,",
    "if the relay can process the received data from the users and aggregate these data and then send the new aggregated data to the destination , it would be possible to achieve diversity .",
    "one instance of such doing can be found in @xcite , where an xoring scheme was considered as a simple way of implementing nc in a wireless network in order to provide diversity in the network .",
    "the authors in  @xcite have proposed a scheme in a marc in which the users send the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) of their coded messages to the destination in a noisy channel , and they have shown that their proposed scheme improves the bit error probability ( bep ) of the system .",
    "practical analogue nc for cooperation in the physical - layer of marc has not been considered yet , and it has prompted us to consider this method of cooperative scheme here .    in this paper , we propose a cooperative scheme based on a simple addition of the received signals in the relay node .",
    "we loosely call this scheme as an instance of analogue nc . to this end",
    ", we consider a system which uses decode and forward ( df ) for relay cooperation , and after modulating the users re - encoded packets , simply adds the packets for transmission in the relay .",
    "we assume that each node has a single antenna .",
    "also we assume that each user has a power limitation of @xmath0 , but the power limitation of the relay node in @xmath1-user marc will be @xmath2 which is logical .",
    "we propose a detection method in the end - node , i.e. destination , being based on v - blast model in a multiple - antenna system  @xcite .",
    "we derive a tight upper bound on the system s bep for both uncoded and coded transmissions , from which we show that using v - blast detection technique , we can achieve full - order diversity , being two in a two - user marc setting .",
    "simulation results indicate that the bounds are tight enough .",
    "moreover , results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two for any number of users and only one relay node , in contrast to the traditional methods ( e.g. alamouti scheme ) in which each user must have two antennas for transmission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "systemdescription ] , we briefly describe the system and the proposed transmission protocol . in section  [ sec : detection ]",
    "we introduce the detection algorithm .",
    "the performance analysis is presented in section  [ sec : perfanal ] .",
    "numerical experiments are shown in section  [ sec : numexp ] .",
    "we finally finish the paper with the concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "notation and abbreviations in the paper are as below .",
    "boldface lower case letters denote column vectors .",
    "concatenation of several vectors is also denoted by a boldface lower case letter .",
    "@xmath3 element of the vector @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "boldface upper case letters are used to denote matrices .",

    "@xmath9 denotes the probability of event @xmath10 when dealing with random variable , @xmath11 , we use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 to denote the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , probability density function ( pdf ) , and characteristic function , respectively .",
    "finally , the notation @xmath15 $ ] is used to denote taking expectation of @xmath16 with respect to the subscript @xmath11 .",
    "for the simplicity of presentation , we consider marc with two users a and b , and one relay r , and the destination d. the results can be generalized for more than two users sharing one relay .",
    "figure  [ fig : marc - view ] shows a two - user marc used throughly in this paper .        in what follows , we model the received signals at the destination and relay node .",
    "the transmitted signal by the relay node is considered in the next subsection .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the channel gain between nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the channel gains are assumed to be independent zero mean complex gaussian random variables with the powers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for the link between the user ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) and the relay ( @xmath26 ) , and the link between node ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or @xmath26 ) and the destination , respectively .",
    "that is , we have considered different qualities for user - relay and user ( relay)-destination channels .",
    "we assume a block fading in which the channel ( gain ) coefficient is constant during each block transmission @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that each user sends a codeword @xmath27 .    for all the wireless communication links shown in figure  [ fig : marc - view ]",
    ", we consider an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) of @xmath28 .",
    "then , knowing the fact that @xmath29 s are normally distributed with the powers mentioned above , the instantaneous signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the link between user @xmath30 and the relay node @xmath26 is given by @xmath31 being distributed exponentially as follows    @xmath32    furthermore , the received signals at the destination from two users can be modeled as @xmath33 whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the received additive ( vector - valued ) white gaussian noises at the destination side .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the vectors of dimension @xmath1 , denote the transmitted blocks from users @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , with the following power constraints : @xmath38 where @xmath1 is the number of bits in each block .",
    "similarly , the received signals at the relay node are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the noises received at the relay node through user @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "since , in this paper we aim at proposing a cooperative protocol while sharing a single relay node by two nodes , we propose to divide the time as shown in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] . in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] the transmission time slots are allocated based on time division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme .        as illustrated in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] , in the first two time slots , users a and b transmit their blocks .",
    "then , the relay , based on its received signals @xmath42 and @xmath43 , decodes the received blocks . depending on whether or not the relay can correctly decode the received blocks , which can be recognized by a error - detecting code ( e.g. , crc codes ) , the relay decides upon cooperation with the two transmitters in the third slot , as shown in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] leading to four possible scenarios summarized in table  [ table : relayscenarios ] .    .four possible states at the relay node . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be inferred from table  [ table : relayscenarios ] , relay cooperation can be categorized into four states : first , corresponding to @xmath44 , the relay will be silent , and as a result the destination only receives the direct block transmissions from two users .",
    "hence , the bit error probability is the same as that of a direct transmission with power @xmath45 .",
    "second , corresponding to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the relay node only cooperates in transmission of one of the users .",
    "thereby , only one of the users benefits a second order diversity transmission . denoting this user by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the received signal at the destination from the relay will be @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are relay s estimate of user s signal and additive noise at the destination , respectively . in this case , the bit error probability for the assisted user is equal to that of a maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) receiver , @xcite , with two independent receptions of the transmitted signal , and for the other user , it is similar to the first state .",
    "lastly , for @xmath53 , the relay can successfully decode both users blocks .",
    "then , the relay encodes and modulates these signals separately , and transmits the sum of the modulated analog signals .",
    "thus , the destination node will receive the following signal @xmath54",
    "in this section , we propose a method for detection at the destination node .",
    "first , we assume that the destination knows fading coefficients , e.g. by acquiring transmitting pilot symbols , and also knows the state of cooperation at the relay , e.g. it can be implemented by sending 2 bits encoding four states . for @xmath55 in table",
    "[ table : relayscenarios ] , both users have interference - free direct transmission , and , as stated above , the conventional receiver is used . for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , the user which is able to utilize relay resource , the destination uses mrc of the two received signals , one from the user and the other from the relay . in the last state",
    ", we propose a novel method for detection relying on the basis of v - blast detection .",
    "first , from equations  - , we rewrite the three received signals in three time slots ( see figure  [ fig : timeslot ] ) at the destination in a following matrix format given by    @xmath58    without loss of generality , we focus on detecting user @xmath24 s block . doing so , we first define the vector conveying user @xmath25 s as follows @xmath59 the null space of @xmath60 , denoted by @xmath61 $ ] , can then be spanned by @xmath62    it should be noted that , the matrix @xmath63 defined in equation   is one of many possible null spaces for vector @xmath64 . now multiplying both sides of   by transposed of matrix @xmath63 , one may obtain @xmath65\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{a } }   + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }   \\frac { { - h_{\\text{r , d } } } } { { \\sqrt { |h_{\\text{b , d } } |^2   + |h_{\\text{r , d } } |^2 } } } \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{b}}^d   + \\frac{{h_{\\text{b , d } } } } { { \\sqrt { |h_{\\text{b , d } } |^2   + |h_{\\text{r , d } } |^2 } } } \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{r}}^d   \\\\   \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{a}}^d",
    "\\\\   \\end{array } \\right]{\\rm {    } } \\ ] ]    as can be realized from equation  , we have two receptions for user @xmath24 s signal .",
    "owing to independency between @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , we have    @xmath69    now , if we use the mrc method for detection of @xmath37 , we obtain    @xmath70    a similar procedure can be employed for @xmath36 by multiplying two sides of equation   by another matrix representing the null space of the vector , conveying user @xmath24 s signal ( similar to that of user @xmath25 ) .",
    "then , the snrs at the outputs of mrc receivers can be written as @xmath71 computing these factors , the destination node chooses to decode the user with the maximum snr at first .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the user with the highest snr , i.e. @xmath73 for this user , the destination utilizes the mrc receiver .",
    "then , the effect of this user signal is subtracted from the received signal @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 then , conditioned on the detection of the user @xmath76 being error - free , for the second user ( denoted by @xmath77 ) a diversity order of two can be achieved , with the following snr @xmath78    denoting the set of all users sharing a relay node in a marc by @xmath79 , the snr of the user to be decoded ( at the destination ) first is given by @xmath80\\frac{p}{n_0}\\ ] ]    after decoding the first user s signal , its effect will be subtracted from @xmath81",
    ". then , the next best user is found , similar to equation   except the fact that , now we have one user less the initial case .",
    "a detailed description of the proposed detection algorithm is illustrated in algorithm  [ alg : detection ] .",
    "[ alg : detection ]",
    "in this section , we evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver .",
    "we assume that the user - relay channel ( urc ) is stronger than both the user- and relay - destination channels ( that is @xmath82 ) .",
    "we also assume that whenever the relay cooperates , it cooperates correctly .",
    "this assumption sounds , since if a strong crc ( cyclic redundancy check ) code is used , the relay can can detect all users signals .",
    "hence , if the relay detects an error in its received codeword , it discards the whole block and does not cooperate . in the following ,",
    "we assume a bpsk modulation .",
    "for the bep evaluation , we first compute the probabilities of each state summarized in table  [ table : relayscenarios ] as follows @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the probabilities that the relay can not correctly decode user a ( b ) transmitted block .",

    "<S> a multiple access relay channel ( marc ) is considered in which an analogue - like network coding is implemented in the relay node . </S>",
    "<S> this analogue coding is a simple addition of the received signals at the relay node . using `` nulling detection '' structure employed in v - blast receiver , we propose a detection scheme in the destination which is able to provide a diversity order of two for all users . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme for the marc with two users where tight upper bounds for both uncoded and convolutionally coded transmission blocks are provided . </S>",
    "<S> we verify our analytical evaluations by simulations and compare the results with those of non - cooperative transmission and alamouti s scheme for the same power and rate transmission . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that while our proposed scheme shows a comparable performance compared to the alamouti s scheme , it substantially outperforms the non - cooperate transmission .    </S>",
