    "the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity remains one of the fundamental issues unsolved in condensed matter physics .",
    "in particular , a unified theory toward the understanding of the rich phase diagram of high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) has not been established . at half - filling ,",
    "the parent compounds of htsc are antiferromagnetic insulators . upon doping",
    ", the antiferromagnetic long - range correlation is suppressed and the high-@xmath0 superconductivity develops above a critical doping level . at low doping but in the metallic state ,",
    "a pseudogap phase with missing entropy or spectra is discovered.@xcite around the optimal doping , a strange metal phase with a linear in - plane resistivity and probably a quantum critical point emerges.@xcite in the heavily overdoped regime , the conventional landau fermi liquid behaviors are gradually recovered . throughout the whole doping range , the electron states seem to be intrinsically inhomogeneous.@xcite    a must step in the understanding of the phase diagram of htsc is to identify the energy scales and the control parameters or interactions of low - energy excitations of htsc . in the normal state at low doping ,",
    "the pseudogap is believed to be one of the characteristic parameters of low - lying excitations .",
    "the corresponding temperature below which the pseudogap effect is observed is commonly used as a boundary to separate the pseudogap and the strange metal phases , although there is no real phase transition between these phases . however , due to the uncertainty in the definition of the pseudogap , different experiments have adopted different criteria to determine the pseudogap energy scale .",
    "this leads to the claim of the existence of two pseudogaps , namely , the upper and lower pseudogaps.@xcite in the strange metal phase , the quantum critical fluctuation is strong and the temperature itself may serve as a dynamic control parameter as suggested by the marginal fermi liquid theory .",
    "@xcite    the scaling analysis of experimental data in htsc is a simple but powerful tool in elucidating the underlying physics without invoking a specific model . in the normal state , if the pseudogap is a predominant energy scale controlling low - energy excitations , then the low - temperature behavior of any measurement physical quantity should satisfy a doping - independent scaling law , although the analytic expression of the scaling function is unknown .",
    "based on this idea , we analyzed recently the temperature dependence of the c - axis resistivity @xmath1 of htsc and found that it obeys a universal scaling law given by@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a doping dependent coefficient , @xmath4 is temperature , and @xmath5 is the pseudogap .",
    "as shown in ref . , eq .",
    "( [ sec1:rhoc ] ) results from the interplay between the anisotropic c - axis hopping integral@xcite and the @xmath6-like symmetry of the pseudogap .",
    "it agrees excellently with the experimental data of multilayer htsc and resolved a long - standing puzzle regarding the physical origin of the semiconductorlike temperature dependence of @xmath1 in the pseudogap phase .",
    "furthermore , it suggests that there is only one energy scale controlling the low - energy excitations around the antinodal points and the interlayer hopping within each unit cell is coherent .",
    "however , if the scaling function is unknown , the scaling analysis becomes difficult .",
    "this has , in fact , hampered the application of the scaling analysis .",
    "a commonly adopted approach in the scaling analysis in the literature is to assume that by normalizing both the measurement quantity @xmath7 and the temperature by the corresponding values at a sample - dependent characteristic temperature @xmath8 , then all the experimental data should fall onto a single curve described by the scaling function @xmath9 however , in real materials , this scaling analysis often fails since @xmath7 generally contains the terms which are not scaling invariant .",
    "for example , the impurity contribution to the in - plane resistivity or other physical quantities is not scaling variant .",
    "moreover , since @xmath10 is unknown prior to the analysis , this formula is difficult to be implemented practically even if it is correct .",
    "empirically , @xmath10 is often determined from some special features appearing in the measurement data .",
    "for example , for the in - plane resistivity , @xmath10 is determined from the temperature below which the resistivity begins to deviate from its high - temperature linear-@xmath4 behavior .",
    "however , to determine unambiguously the linear-@xmath4 region is not always possible since in some low doping samples , the measured temperature may not be high enough to reach the linear-@xmath4 regime .",
    "furthermore , the deviation from linear to nonlinear @xmath4 is a crossover , not a phase transition , and a small measurement error may result in a large error in @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scaling method and apply it to analyze the normal state properties of htsc .",
    "this method extends our previous scaling analysis of the c - axis resistivity to other physical quantities .",
    "it breaks the barrier in the use of the simple formula ( [ sec1:scaling ] ) and allows a model - independent scaling analysis to be done reliably .",
    "we have reanalyzed the experimental data of the c - axis resistivity of htsc with this method . by comparison with our previous results,@xcite",
    "we find that this method , indeed , works very well .",
    "it provides a simple but powerful approach for analyzing experimental results .",
    "furthermore , this method is model independent .",
    "it can be applied not only to the high-@xmath0 cuprates , but also to any other materials where the single parameter scaling behavior is valid .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] gives an introduction to the scaling method based on a least square fit of an unknown scaling function to the experimental data . in sec .",

    "we start by assuming that in a relevant temperature range the low - lying physics is governed only by one energy scale @xmath5 .",

    "the scaling function @xmath17 is generally unknown .",

    "this suggests that the reference sample should be chosen such that its temperature interval is broad enough to cover the whole temperature range physically interesting and the data quality is among one of the best .",

    "[ sec:3 ] are , indeed , governed by the same energy scale .",
    "this is a remarkable result since different coefficients probe different responses of charge and/or spin degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the c - axis resistivity @xmath1 is susceptive to the charged excitations around the antinodal points , while the in - plane resistivity @xmath60 is mainly affected by the scattering of charged quasiparticles around the node points .",
    "the uniform magnetic susceptibility probes the spin fluctuations around @xmath69 , while the spin - lattice relaxation rate is strongly dependent on the antiferromagnetic fluctuations around @xmath70 .    in the underdoped regime ,",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath5 drops almost linearly with doping .",
    "this is consistent with the doping dependence of the pseudogap observed by arpes,@xcite tunneling,@xcite and other measurements.@xcite thus , the control energy scale in this regime is , indeed , the pseudogap . if we extrapolate the underdoped data of @xmath5 to zero doping , we find that @xmath5 is in order of @xmath71 , and to higher doping , @xmath5 vanishes roughly at @xmath72-@xmath73 .    in the literature , two kinds of pseudogaps ( or the onset temperatures of pseudogap ) , which were often quoted as the  large \" and  small \" pseudogaps , were reported.@xcite the large pseudogap generally refers to the characteristic temperature @xmath8 measured , for example , by the magnetic susceptibility,@xcite the hall coefficient.@xcite the small one could be the energy scale probed by other experimental techniques , such as the transport properties measurements @xcite or the leading - edge shift around the antinodal direction measured by the arpes.@xcite our scaling analysis indicates that these two energy scales are , in fact , physically indistinguishable .    in the overdoped regime ,",
    "the universal scaling behavior generally breaks down . for overdoped la214 , @xmath64 determined from the thermopower and the hall coefficients separates into two branches with different energies .",
    "@xmath64 determined from the thermopower is higher than that from the hall effect .",
    "this may imply the existence of two energy scales in the overdoped regime .",
    "however , as the single - parameter scaling law still holds in this regime for both the thermopower and the hall coefficients , further investigation on this issue is desired .",
    "recently , there is a surge of interest in the discussion of two - gap energies , namely , the pseudogap in the normal state and the relatively smaller superconducting gap in the superconducting state .",
    "the existence of a distinct energy scale in the superconducting state , whose doping dependence is different from that of the pseudogap , was first reported in the penetration depth measurements@xcite and later in the andreev reflection measurements.@xcite this lower energy scale characterizes the low - lying excitations around the gap nodes and appears only in the superconducting state . recently ,",
    "arpes,@xcite raman scattering,@xcite and inelastic neutron measurements@xcite have further confirmed the existence of these two distinguished energy scales .",
    "furthermore , the arpes has revealed that the two - gap structure is intimately connected with the arc ( or pocket ) feature of the fermi surface of htsc in the underdoped regime .",
    "it is believed that the superconducting gap develops predominately on the fermi arc below @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the early arpes measurement data .",
    "@xcite however , there exists also other experimental measurements , which suggest that there is only one energy scale in the superconducting state and the superconducting gap around the nodal points is nothing but an extension of the pseudogap in the arc area in the superconducting state.@xcite this one energy scale scenario is consistent with the picture of resonant valence bonds based on the charge - spin separation@xcite as well as that of preformed pairs.@xcite    in this work , we have shown that there is only one energy scale in the normal state . however , as we have only analyzed the scaling behavior of the experimental data in the normal state , we are unable to address the issue of two energy gaps in the superconducting state .",
    "it is of great interest to extend the single - parameter scaling method introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] to the superconducting state at which two energy scales ( or control parameters ) may exist .",
    "this would then allow us to judge whether there is only one or two energy scales in the superconducting state from the model - independent scaling analysis of various transport and thermodynamic coefficients .",
    "we have introduced a scaling method to study the scaling behavior in the normal state of htsc .",
    "we have analyzed the scaling behavior of the c - axis resistivity , the in - plane resistivity , the hall coefficient , the thermoelectric power , the magnetic susceptibility , and the nuclear magnetic resonance , and extracted the corresponding energy scales .",
    "it is found that all these quantities , no matter how different they are , exhibit universal scaling behaviors , controlled by a single energy scale in the normal state .",
    "furthermore , we find that all these energy scales obtained from different physical coefficients have the same doping dependence as the pseudogap .",
