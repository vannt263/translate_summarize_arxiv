    "in this talk i am going to discuss on the geometrical property of space generated by the monte carlo simulation of 4d quantum gravity mostly with one u(1 ) gauge field . this is the third of a series of our reports on this topic at the past lattice conferences@xcite .",
    "let me first review the present status in order to recollect the motivation and aim of our work .",
    "in 1998 there appeared a paper @xcite which influenced us very much .",
    "it is claimed that by adding gauge matter fields a new phase , which is called the crinkled phase , appears . in some sense",
    "this result has been already predicted by the analytic calculation @xcite .",
    "taking the conformal mode seriously into account , while the transverse mode is treated perturbatively , the string susceptibility is shown to have the similar form as the liouville theory of 2d quantum gravity .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case adding matter fields brings the space towards a stable configuration .",
    "although the numerical results gave us a lot of hope for further investigation along this line , there still remain a few pathological problems .    at lattice 98",
    "we added a new data in order to clear some of the problems .",
    "firstly , we have observed the new phase even in the case with one gauge field .",
    "furthermore , we did not have any pathological problems previously encountered at the transition point . in the lattice 99",
    "we have presented a result of the finite size scaling analysis showing that the transition is continuous and the fractal dimension measured by two independent methods both gave about 4.6 at the transition point .",
    "although there still remains some points such as the phase diagram to be discussed among two groups , we feel that in practice we should not worry too much about the phase diagrams as far as the phase transition remains continuous and possibly of second order .    in the followings we take our numerical results seriously , and",
    "study the consequence mostly on the geometry of space for the case with one u(1 ) field .",
    "let me spend an ample time to describe our method employed in the numerical simulation .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the symmetric factor of a triangulation @xmath3 , and sums are taken over all possible triangulations with the topology fixed at @xmath0 .",
    "the action is given on the 4d simplicial manifold by @xmath4 for the einstein - hilbert term , where @xmath5 is the number of @xmath6-th simplex .",
    "the two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to the inverse of the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant respectively .",
    "the action , @xmath9 corresponds to gauge matter fields , where @xmath10 is the non - compact gauge fields defined on the link between vertices @xmath6 and @xmath11 with the sign convention , @xmath12 .",
    "sums are taken over all triangles @xmath13 in the triangulation @xmath3 with the weight factor @xmath14 , which is given by the number of 4-simplices sharing the triangle @xmath13 .",
    "the term @xmath15 is added to the action artificially in order to control @xmath16 around @xmath17 by choosing the parameter @xmath18 appropriately .",
    "measurements are made at every 100 sweeps and totally 5 to 10k configurations for each point in the graphs .",
    "our primary concern to the present work is to make sure that we are dealing with the einstein gravity . to this end",
    "one may ask oneself the following questions : 1 ) does the average property of space reflect the classical solution of einstein equation ?",
    "2 ) is there massless graviton acting between masses ?",
    "unfortunately , we do not have simulation data with large space configuration enough to answer the second question , and in this report we consider only the first question .",
    "the first measurement we make is the distribution of local scalar curvature .",
    "the local scalar curvature at a 4-simplex @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the deficit angle of a triangle @xmath22 , @xmath23 and where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the area and the volume of the elementary triangle and the 4-simplex respectively . in this definition",
    "the local curvature is an average of curvatures attached to 10 triangles @xmath22 which belong to the 4-simplex @xmath19 .",
    "the lattice constant is chosen so that @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to the 2d simulation the scalar curvatures distribute sharply about average values .    [",
    "fig : curvature ]    in order to see how the curvature distributes locally in space , we measure the curvature @xmath27 averaged over a strip between two rings with geodesic distances @xmath28 and @xmath29 from a fixed 4-simplex @xmath19 on the @xmath0 sphere ( fig.1 ) . from the figure",
    "the space looks homogeneous .",
    "measuring @xmath27 for several starting simplices we check the rotational symmetry of the space .",
    "it indeed shows that the space is fairly symmetric .",
    "the einstain equation with the cosmological term has a homogeneous and symmetric solution with @xmath0 topology of the form @xmath30 where the parameter @xmath31 is related to the scalar curvature as @xmath32 and to the cosmological constant as @xmath33 .",
    "the space simulated by the dynamical triangulation shows fractal property with the hausdorff dimension a little bigger than 4 @xcite , while the space obtained as a classical solution of the einstain equation is smooth and its dimension is apparently 4 .    in order to draw the coordinate frame on such a fractal space we need to rescale the distance . by comparing the d - step volume , i.e. the number of simplices covered within d - steps from a fixed simplex , to the volume within a distance @xmath34 from a point of the classical space ( eq.([eq : ds ] ) ) , @xmath35 the result is shown in fig.2 by rescaling @xmath36 , adjusting the parameters as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig : volume ]    the second measurement is for the effect of matter .",
    "we then check the effect of mass by fixing the scalar curvature at a simplex @xmath19 as @xmath39 .",
    "numerically we reject those geometrical moves which change @xmath40 without any constraint in matter field configurations .",
    "the effects are shown for the scalar curvature in fig.1 .",
    "the average property of curvature distribution is symmetric and it can be written as a symmetric solution of the einstein equation of @xmath0 universe : @xmath41 the scalar curvature of the space is given by @xmath42 from this equation it is possible to obtain the function @xmath43 numerically by measuring @xmath44,resulting as @xmath45 from these numerical results we find that the space with and without mass can be considered as the solution of einstein equation with the cosmological term , if we rescale the coordinate appropriately . however , in order to check whether it is the theoretically expected solution of quantum gravity is left for the analytic calculation for the gauge matter energy concentration .",
    "taking the numerical simulation of simplicial quantum gravity with u(1 ) gauge fields seriously , we have measured the geometry of space .",
    "although the microscopic structure of space exhibits fractal , the hausdorff dimension is @xmath46 , which is rather close to the classical dimension 4 .",
    "furthermore , the scalar curvature distributes sharply about its average , and the global geometry seems to have a correspondence to the solution of einstein equation for both cases with and without mass .",
    "these results encourage us to proceed further for the correlation measurement in order to detect graviton .",
    "we also feel that it is now worth considering more seriously to make effort to compare numerical results to the analytic calculation along the conformal quantum gravity@xcite .",
