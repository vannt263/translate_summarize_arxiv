    "coupled chaotic systems are recently calling much attention due to the verification that they may be useful to the understanding of natural systems in a variety of fields as in ecology @xcite , in neuroscience @xcite , in economy @xcite , and in lasers @xcite .",
    "it has been verified that despite of the higher dimensionality of a coupled chaotic system , the coupling among the elements might make them to synchronize @xcite , reducing the dynamics of the system to a few degrees of freedom .    in this work ,",
    "we focus our attention in the phenomenon of phase synchronization ( ps ) , which describes the appearance of a phase synchronous behavior between two interacting chaotic systems @xcite , i.e. , given two chaotic systems , their phase difference remains bounded , despite of the fact that their amplitudes may be uncorrelated .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly interesting since it can arise from a very small coupling strength .",
    "its presence was reported in a variety of experimental systems .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated in electronic circuits @xcite , and latter in electrochemical oscillators @xcite .",
    "it was found in plasma @xcite , in the chua s circuit @xcite , and there were also found evidences of phase synchronization in communication processes in the human brain @xcite .    to detect ps in a real - time experiment , one has to measure the phase of the chaotic trajectory @xcite .",
    "however , the phase is not always an easily accessible information . to overcome this difficulty , it is important to understand fundamental properties of phase synchronous systems , that could be experimentally easily verified . for chaotic systems that are phase synchronized with a periodic forcing @xcite , it was reported that a stroboscopic map of the trajectory was a subset of this attractor and occupies only partially the region delimitated by a projection of the attractor .",
    "this property was used to detect in a real - time experiment phase synchronization between the chua s circuit and a sinusoidal forcing @xcite .",
    "this approach of detecting phase synchronization through the stroboscopic map can be extended for coupled chaotic oscillators , in a formal way .",
    "the stroboscopic map is generalized to the * conditional poincar map*. given two oscillators , at least one being chaotic , the conditional poincar map is constructed by collecting points in one oscillator at the moment at which some event happens in the other one . if the set of discrete points generated by this conditional map does not visit any arbitrary region of a especial projection of the chaotic attractor , we call this set a * p - set*. this property of the conditional poincar map is called non - transitivity @xcite , i.e. , an initial condition under the conditional poincar map does not visit everywhere in a subspace of the attractor . alike",
    "the stroboscopic maps of oscillators that are in phase synchrony with a forcing , the conditional poincar maps of coupled chaotic oscillators , in ps , also only partially occupy a projection of the attractor .    in this work ,",
    "we show how the conditional poincar map can be used to detect ps , without actually having to measure the phase . for phase - coherent oscillators , a special type of p - set , that we call ps - set ( phase synchronization set ) ,",
    "conversely , its existence also implies ps .",
    "we illustrate our findings and ideas with numerical and experimental analyzes in the forced chua s circuit , and the coupled rsller oscillator @xcite .",
    "further , we extend these results to non - phase coherent attractors .",
    "finally , we also introduce a phase of a chaotic trajectory to be a quantity related to the amount of rotation of the tangent vector .",
    "this definition can be used to chaotic attractors , independently whether they have phase - coherent or non phase - coherent dynamics .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] , we define a way to measure the phase of a chaotic flow , and discuss the relation between the average returning time and the average angular frequency . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ps ] , we discuss the conditions for ps states and , in sec . [",
    "sec : chua ] , we describe the phenomenon of ps in the forced chua s circuit .",
    "we introduce the notion of a conditional poincar map in sec .",
    "[ cpm ] and the p - sets ( as well as the ps - sets ) in sec .",
    "[ p - sets ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bsc ] , we show how ps can be found by the detection of these sets in the forced chua s circuit and in sec .",
    "[ sec : bsr ] , for the coupled rssler oscillator .",
    "further , in sec . [ extension ] , we discuss the extension of these ideas to a class of non - coherent oscillators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cr ] , we make some remarks and the conclusions of this work . in appendix",
    "a , we formally introduce the conditional poincar map and the p - set , and in appendix b , we show that for coherent dynamics the ps - sets exist if , and only if , there is ps .",
    "in other words , ps implies ps - sets and vice - versa .",
    "the phase of a chaotic attractor in a projection @xmath0 ( a subspace ) is defined to be the amount of rotation of the tangent vector in this projection , and can be represented by an integral function of the type    @xmath1    with @xmath2 being an infinitesimal displacement of the tangent vector of the flow , from time @xmath3 to time @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ fase ] ) , we are measuring the amount of rotation , per unit time , of a projection of the tangent vector of the flow , on the same subspace @xmath0 where the phase is defined .",
    "we call this subspace @xmath6 .",
    "the attractor @xmath7 , projected on the subspace @xmath6 is regarded as @xmath8 .",
    "the instantaneous angular frequency of the trajectory in @xmath8 , named @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",

    "( [ fase ] ) , @xmath11 and , the average angular frequency @xmath12 is @xmath13 @xmath14 represents the average . equation ( [ natural_frequence_2 ] ) can be put into the form @xmath15 = @xmath16 .",
    "whenever a poincar section can be defined , the average period of the chaotic attractor on the subspace @xmath6 is calculated by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 represents the time at which the trajectory in the subspace @xmath6 makes the @xmath20-th crossing with this poincar section .",
    "we introduce @xmath21 to be the average displacement of the phase for a typical period as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the phase associated to the subspace @xmath6 at the moment that the @xmath24-th crossing between the trajectory and the poincar section happens .",
    "thus , we can put eq .",
    "( [ natural_frequence_2 ] ) as @xmath25 for the forced chua s circuit , the subspace @xmath26 is defined by a suitable projection of the circuit variable .",
    "we have that @xmath27 .",
    "so , eq . ( [ natural_frequence_1 ] ) can be written as @xmath28 .",
    "for the coupled rssler oscillator , the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ natural_frequence_1 ] ) can be calculated in two subspaces , one associated to the variables of one rssler , the subspace @xmath26 , and the subspace @xmath29 , associated to the variables of the other rssler system . as shown in @xcite , @xmath30 might slightly differs from @xmath31 , and thus , @xmath32 .",
    "( [ natural_frequence_2 ] ) and ( [ natural_frequence_1 ] ) relate the average period , the average angular frequency , and the phase of a chaotic trajectory .",
    "this shows that the average period ( recurrence ) and the average angular frequency are intimately connected in phase coherent chaotic systems , and both these quantities can be calculated from the phase .",
    "having defined phase , ps exists whenever the following condition is satisfied    @xmath33    the minimal bound for the phase difference , @xmath30 , in terms of the phase as defined by eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) , was theoretically estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . equation ( [ ps ] ) means that the phase difference between the two coupled systems is always bounded , and @xmath34 is a rational constant @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath35 in this work , we will consider cases for @xmath34=1 .",
    "otherwise , a simple change of variables could eliminate this constant from eq .",

    "if ps exists , @xmath42 = @xmath43 , @xmath44=@xmath45 , and @xmath46=@xmath47 , and therefore , we could have in the right term of eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) @xmath48 , instead of @xmath49 .",
    "the circuit is represented by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 represent , respectively , the tension across two capacitors and the current through the inductor ( see @xcite for more details ) , @xmath39 and @xmath54 are the angular frequency and the amplitude of the forcing , respectively",

    ", we first define the subspace @xmath26 to be given by the pair of variables @xmath63 , and then , we use eq .",
    "( [ fase ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig6 ] , we show the difference between the phase of the chaotic circuit [ as calculated by eq .",
    "( [ fase ] ) ] and the phase of the forcing , @xmath64 . in ( a ) , the phase difference is bounded and the average period of the chaotic attractor , defined as the average recurrence time of trajectories that cross the section @xmath65 , is equal to @xmath66=3.57015 , which is equal to 1/f , since @xmath67=0.2801 .",
    "the average angular frequency can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ natural_frequence_1 ] ) , which gives us @xmath68=1.75992 . or , from eq .",
    "( [ natural_frequence_2 ] ) , which gives us @xmath38=1.75992 .",
    "note that the average growing of the phase [ calculated by eq .",
    "( [ fase ] ) ] for a typical average period is @xmath69 which is @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig6](b ) , we have that @xmath70=3.57006 which is different from @xmath41 , since @xmath67=0.279 .",
    "so , in ( b ) there is no ps , and consequently inequality ( [ ps ] ) is not satisfied .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we detected @xmath71 experimentally in the forced chua s circuit , whenever stroboscopic maps could be constructed for a time interval equal to @xmath72 , such that this map , projected into the same subspace considered to calculate the phase , does not occupy the region occupied by the attractor projected on the same subspace .    to understand this technique ,",
    "we assume that @xmath73 , the phase of the chaotic trajectory , is the angle ( on the lift ) described by the vector position of this trajectory ( rssler - like attractor ) , and @xmath74=@xmath75 the phase of the forcing . if eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) is satisfied at any time , then it is satisfied at multiples of the period of the forcing @xmath76 .",
    "so , we get @xmath77 , which means that a stroboscopic map has to be concentrated in an angular section smaller than @xmath31 . the stroboscopic map , which is already a subset of the chaotic flow , projected into the same subspace considered to calculate the phase , does not occupy the whole region occupied by the attractor projected in this same subspace .",
    "another property of the stroboscopic map is that points in it are mapped into it by looking at the trajectory after a time interval given by @xmath78 , so , it is a subset that is recurrent to itself .    using this technique , and for the same parameters as @xcite , we show in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig1](a ) the experimental synchronization region for the forced chua s circuit in the parameter space @xmath79 .",
    "the triangular shaped region represents parameters for which the stroboscopic map has the points concentrated in an angular section smaller than 2@xmath80 .",
    "the bump at the bottom right side of the ps region is due to non - synchronous states that present a long bounded phase difference . by a typical time interval within which the experiment is realized , which was of the order of 40,000 cycles , the system seemed to be phase synchronized , i.e.",
    ", localized stroboscopic maps were found .",
    "in fact , we have detected these maps even for observation times corresponding to 150,000 cycles , in the region of the bump .    in a short ,",
    "the bump region is an extended structure in the circuit parameter space , that presents intermittent behavior in the phase difference @xcite , but with a long laminar regime , even for parameters far away from the border between the ps and the non ps region .",
    "this intermittency differs from the usual one , observed in the transition to ps , in the fact that this latter happens very close to the border between the ps and the non ps region .",
    "the reason for this intermittency is due to the presence of a periodic window , close to the region of the bump .",
    "simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig1](b ) , where black points represent perturbing parameters for which eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) is satisfied , with @xmath81 defined in eq .",
    "( [ fase ] ) .",
    "one sees that the @xmath71 region resembles a triangle .",
    "the triangular shaped region , denoted by the light gray dashed line , represents the region where the system is not phase synchronized , but the phase difference remains bounded for a long time interval , that might be longer than 100,000 cycles of the systems .",
    "so , we reproduce numerically the same atypical intermittency observed experimentally , i.e. , long laminar regime in the phase difference , for parameter regions away from the border between ps and non ps states .",
    "this happens associated with a periodic window , as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig1](b ) .",
    "the shape of the synchronization region in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig1](b ) is equivalent to the region in the experiment , constructed by detecting the stroboscopic maps contained within a small angular section .",
    "this proposes an equivalence between the existence of a recurrent subset and the verification of eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) . inside the synchronization region",
    ", a stroboscopic map appears like in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig7](a ) , where the light gray points represent the attractor , and the dark filled circles , the map . outside of the @xmath71 region , there are parameter sets for which the stroboscopic maps do not occupy the region occupied by the attractor , at the projection in which the phase is calculated .",
    "as one sees in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig7](b ) [ for the parameters represented by the plus symbol in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig1](b ) ] there is a region of the projected attractor ( pointed by the arrow ) for which the stroboscopic map never visits .",
    "the difference between the stroboscopic map that appears while there is ps in ( a ) , and the stroboscopic map that appears while there is not ps in ( b ) , is that points of the stroboscopic map in ( a ) are all concentrated in an angular section of the attractor .",
    "as it will be further classified , the stroboscopic map in ( a ) is a ps - set and in ( b ) is a p - set .    as a way to better characterize the ps phenomena in the chua s circuit",
    ", we calculate the lyapunov exponents .",
    "as usually expected , the transition to ps is associated to one of the exponents becoming smaller than zero .",
    "since there is already one exponent that is smaller than zero , ps induces the creation of a second stable direction in the chua s circuit .",
    "previous to the transition to phase synchronization , this exponent was zero . in fig .",
    "[ ps_fig8 ] , we show the exponent ( and the error bars ) associated to ps in black and the quantity @xmath82 ( in gray , for a fixed amplitude of @xmath54=0.0015 ) with respect to the frequency . in the region that the exponent becomes smaller than zero , @xmath38=@xmath39 , satisfying eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) .",
    "the finding of maps of the attractor that appear as localized structures implies ps .",
    "the conditional poincar map introduced in this chapter as a generalization of the stroboscopic map , is an efficient way of revealing the existence of such special mappings .",
    "the stroboscopic map technique defined for periodically driven chaotic systems was explained in the previous sections .",
    "to extent the idea of stroboscopic map in coupled chaotic oscillators we came up with the conditional poincar map , which is a map of the flow , constructed by observing it for specific times at which events occur in the subsystems @xmath8 .",
    "an event is considered to happen when the trajectory of one subsystem crosses a poincar section .",
    "so , given two oscillators @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( at least one being chaotic ) , with trajectories in the subspaces where the phase is defined , the conditional poincar map of @xmath83 is the trajectory position at the moment that a series of equal events happens , in @xmath84 .",
    "analogously , the conditional poincar map of @xmath84 is the trajectory position at the moment that a series of equal events happens , in @xmath83 . in the case of",
    "periodically forced chaotic systems , an event may be defined to happen whenever the forcing reaches a specific value , and the conditional poincar map is the usual stroboscopic map , because the time interval between two events is constant . in coupled chaotic systems ,",
    "the time interval between two successive events is no longer constant .",
    "we define a time series of events @xmath85 , by the following rule :    * @xmath86 represents the time at which the @xmath20-th crossing of the trajectory of @xmath84 occurs in a poincar plane .",
    "* @xmath87 represents the time at which the @xmath20-th crossing of the trajectory of @xmath83 occurs in a poincar plane .",
    "the discrete set of points observed at the times @xmath85 is called set @xmath88 .",
    "this set , projected at the subspaces @xmath6 ( where the phase is calculated ) , is named @xmath89 .",
    "the conditional poincar map is represented by @xmath90 .",
    "so , we say that @xmath89 is the set of points generated by @xmath90 .",
    "the next step is to define when @xmath89 can be regarded as either a p - set or a ps - set , this last set implying phase synchronization .",
    "the @xmath89 set is a p - set , if it does not completely fulfill the projection @xmath8 of the attractor . in other words ,",
    "a discrete set @xmath89 is considered to be a p - set , if for balls of radius @xmath91 , centered in all points of the attractor projection @xmath8 , one does not find points of @xmath89 inside of all these balls .",
    "if @xmath89 completely fulfill @xmath8 , we say that these two sets are equivalent ( and we represent this by the symbol @xmath92 ) .",
    "more details , see appendix a.    so , a p - set exists , if the conditional poincar map is not transitive on @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "that is , the flow , observed by the times for which the conditional poincar map is defined , does not visit arbitrary regions of @xmath8 .",
    "note that however , the attractor is chaotic , and therefore , the chaotic set is always transitive through the flow .",
    "so , given a set of initial conditions , its evolution through the flow eventually reaches arbitrary open subsets of the original chaotic attractor .",
    "we can classify three relevant types of sets generated by the conditional poincar map    type - a : :    @xmath89 is equivalent to    @xmath8    ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the conditional    poincar map @xmath90 is transitive in    @xmath8 .",
    "p - set : :    @xmath89 is not equivalent to    @xmath8    ( @xmath94 ) . the    conditional poincar map is not transitive in    @xmath8 .",
    "ps - set : :    @xmath89 is p - set , with the additional condition    that it is localized in the vicinity of the poincar section chosen to    define the events .    in the following , we comment each case :      _",
    "these sets appear whenever there is no ps_. if two non - identical coupled chaotic systems ( topologically similar ) are not phase synchronized , the chaotic trajectories do not make correlated events in both subspaces @xmath26 and @xmath29 . as a consequence while the trajectory is positioned at the specified poincar plane , at the subspace @xmath26 , the trajectory in the subspace @xmath29 is everywhere in this subspace , making the set @xmath89 to be equivalent to @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting illustration is the case of two uncoupled equal chaotic systems , but with different initial conditions .",
    "as we construct the conditional poincar maps , they will be a type - a set , since also the distance between the trajectories in the two oscillators are sensitive to the initial conditions , and will diverge exponentially .      _",
    "these sets constitutes a necessary , but not sufficient , condition to describe ps . _    in periodically forced chaotic systems",
    ", they might appear when there is not ps .",
    "as we already mentioned , the points in these sets are not localized in special spots of the attractor projection . as a consequence",
    ", the domain of the absolute difference between the time at which the same number of events happen in both oscillators has a broad character .",
    "_ ps - sets imply ps and vice - versa_. they exist , if and only if , there is phase synchronization , as shown in appendix b , and illustrated with the examples in sec .",
    "[ sec : chua ] , and throughout this work .",
    "another important point is that the ps - set provides a real - time detection that can be easily experimentally implemented ( sec .",
    "[ sec : chua ] ) , and easily constructed from a data set .",
    "ps - set implies ps because the difference between the time at which the @xmath24-th event happens in both oscillators is small , which means that the time difference @xmath95 is smaller than a finite constant value . as a consequence",
    ", the points in the conditional poincar map of one oscillator are confined around the poincar section chosen to define the events .",
    "therefore , the detection of a ps - set can be done by observing this characteristic of the conditional poincar map .    for rssler - like oscillators ,",
    "in which the trajectory spirals around an equilibrium point , the ps - set is confined within an angular section .",
    "having found the ps - set , we can study properties of these sets that give us the level of organization and coherence of the oscillators    a ps - set , @xmath89 , is said to have length 1 , if the set is constructed by the time series of the same events . defining the event to be given by the crossing of the trajectory to a poincar plane , the corresponding time series of events @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 .",
    "for this ps - set , points in @xmath89 are mapped in @xmath89 , after one application of the conditional poincar map .",
    "a ps - set is said to have length 2 , if it is obtained by a time series of two different events .",
    "so , a ps - set can be constructed from more complex series of events .",
    "we construct a length-2 basic set using a time series of events @xmath98 given by @xmath99 @xcite . as an example , for the perturbed chua s circuit , the length-2 basic set is constructed by a stroboscopic map that collects points every half period of the forcing .",
    "a length-2 basic set is assumed to be composed by two other subsets , named minimal sets , the subsets @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "they have the property that if a point @xmath102 is such that @xmath103 , this point , iterated by the conditional poincar map , goes to the minimal set @xmath101 , and if @xmath102 is such that @xmath104 , this point , iterated by the conditional poincar map , goes to the minimal set @xmath101 .",
    "thus , points in @xmath101 are mapped to itself after 2 applications of the conditional poincar map .",

    "as an example , one can think of a spiking - firing oscillator , phase synchronized with a periodic forcing . due to the fact that the spiking - firing dynamics has a fast and a slow mode , the conditional poincar maps might overlap .      here , we explain through a diagram the possible emerging sets from the conditional poincar map .",

    "so , the set @xmath130 is equivalent to the set @xmath134 and , therefore , @xmath134 is not a ps - set , and therefore , it does not exist ps . differently from the chua s circuit ,",

    "the approach presented in this paper can be extended for non - coherent attractors . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , attractors that present non - coherent phase motion in the phase space may present a coherent motion in the space of the velocities , i.e. @xmath135 , which is the case of the funnel attractor @xcite . in this case , the extension of our approach to the non - coherent phase motion is straightforward . instead of defining a conditional poincar map in the phase space , we analyze the dynamics in the velocity space , in which the phase is coherent , and therefore , all the ideas introduced herein can be applied in this new space .    to some chaotic attractors",
    ", it might not be possible to define a poincar section to construct the conditional poincar map .",
    "however , one can still construct these conditional maps by defining different types of events .",
    "for example , in coupled neurons , this event can be chosen as being a beginning or the ending of the bursts , which can be well defined by the crossing of the trajectory with some given threshold .",
    "a chaotic set is always transitive through the flow .",
    "so , given a set of initial conditions , its evolution through the flow eventually reaches arbitrary open subsets of the original chaotic attractor .",
    "however , a stroboscopic map of the flow , whose generalization is here called conditional poincar map , might not possess the transitive property .",
    "that is , given a set of initial conditions , its evolution through the conditional poincar map * _ might _ * not reach arbitrary open subsets of the chaotic attractor .",
    "the introduction of the term `` conditional '' in the map nomenclature comes from the unconventional and non rigidly way we adapt the established definition of a stroboscopic poincar map . for coupled chaotic oscillators , this conditional map is constructed based on events , conveniently chosen at the same subspaces where the phase of a chaotic system is defined . in addition , the application of this map through the flow , which results in a discrete set , is inspected not in the whole phase space , but also in the same subspaces where the phase is defined .",
    "if phase synchronization exists the conditional map generates special discrete sets , named ps - sets .",
    "the contrary is also true .",
    "i.e. , a ps - set implies phase synchronization .",
    "this was illustrated in the periodically forced chua s circuit , in the coupled rssler oscillator , and in other more general ( topologically equivalent ) coupled chaotic systems .",
    "the ideas introduced here provide an efficient way of detecting phase synchronization , without having actually to measure the phase of the chaotic trajectory .",
    "indeed , this detection can be done in experiments in a real - time , as it was done here in the perturbed chua s circuit .",
    "it is worthy to say that the ps - sets are robust under small additive noise that could corrupt the data in an experiment .",
    "this is so , because a small additive noise does not interfere much with the time that the trajectory crosses the poincar section , but just deviates the timing of the crossing .",
    "then , the ps - sets still remains .",
    "this robustness against the noise is an important property in order to apply these ideas in experiments , as done in this work .",
    "we have also introduced the phase as a quantity that measures the velocity of rotation of a projection of the tangent vector along the trajectory .",
    "this definition can be used to arbitrary flows , independently whether or not they present a coherent or non - coherent phase dynamics .",
    "finally , our formalism of the conditional poincar map can be used in coupled maps ( or perturbed ) to detect synchronous behavior ( not * phase * synchronization ) between the systems ( or between the forcing ) , for the case where one does not find full synchronization between the maps .",
    "one particular example where that happens is in the periodically forced logistic equation @xcite or for a system of coupled logistic maps @xcite , where one can find a finite number of synchronous chaotic subsets , the basic sets .",

    "next , we present some formalism using elements of ergodic theory in order to introduce the conditional poincar map and the @xmath89 sets .    given a flow @xmath136 , we call @xmath7 the chaotic attractor",

    "we assume @xmath137 .",
    "the notion of stroboscopic map of a flow can be generalized to any temporal translation on the trajectory .",
    "we define the temporal translation to be a transformation represented by @xmath138 , called conditional poincar map .",

    "so , @xmath145 is the point @xmath144 integrated by the flow for a time interval given by @xmath147 .",
    "applying the transformation @xmath90 , for an infinite series of @xmath141 , that is @xmath148 , gives us a discrete set that we call @xmath88 .",
    "the projection of @xmath88 on the subspace @xmath6 is named @xmath89 .",

    "so , @xmath152 . there is a transformation @xmath153 that generates the set @xmath149 , with the property that @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",

    "this property makes the transformation @xmath153 to be transitive in the set @xmath149 .",
    "however , the conditional poincar map might no longer be transitive .    for example , in the case of the @xmath158-fold of the transformation @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath159 .",
    "given an initial condition in the set @xmath150 , its iteration by @xmath159 will never reach the set @xmath151 .",
