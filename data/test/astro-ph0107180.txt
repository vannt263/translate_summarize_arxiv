    "observations of young rotation - powered pulsars offer unique opportunities to illuminate several fundamental questions about the physics of neutron stars and supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "in particular , synchrotron emission from a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) can be used to determine properties of the relativistic pulsar wind , to probe the density of the ambient medium , and to study the evolution of snr ejecta and their interaction with the local ism . confirmed associations between pulsars and snrs also provide the opportunity to directly constrain the birth properties of neutron stars , including their space velocities and initial rotation periods .",
    "such associations are often difficult to judge on the basis of the distance and age estimates for both objects , and a very powerful method of confirming an association is the observation of interaction between pulsar / pwn and snr . however , young pulsars are rare , and cases where such interaction is apparent are rarer still",
    ".    one of the main aims of the parkes multibeam survey of the galactic plane ( @xcite ) is precisely to detect young pulsars , and at least @xmath4 of the 600 pulsars discovered to date are youthful , with characteristic age @xmath5kyr .",
    "several of these are energetic as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this letter",
    "we report on one such object , which archival radio , x - ray , and @xmath6-ray observations suggest is remarkable .",
    "was discovered in data acquired on 1999 march 15 , collected in the course of the pulsar multibeam survey ( @xcite ) at the 64-m parkes telescope in nsw , australia .",
    "the pulsar has been the subject of regular timing observations at parkes since 1999 may .",
    "these use the center beam of the multibeam receiver and the same data - acquisition system as the survey to collect total - power samples every 0.25ms from 96 contiguous frequency channels between 1230 and 1518mhz .",
    "the 1-bit digitized samples are written to tape for subsequent analysis , together with relevant telescope parameters , including the start time of the observation referred to the observatory time standard .",
    "the time on - source is 9min on average each observing day .",
    "the timing data are analyzed in standard fashion : samples from higher frequency channels are appropriately delayed to compensate for dispersion in the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "data from all frequency channels are then summed and the resulting time series is folded modulo the predicted topocentric pulsar period to generate an average profile for each observation .",
    "a sum of several aligned average profiles yields the `` standard profile '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof_res ] ) , with which individual profiles are correlated to obtain times - of - arrival ( toas ) .",
    "the toas are analyzed with the tempo software package : they are converted to the solar - system barycenter using the jpl  de200 planetary ephemeris ( @xcite ) , and fitted to a taylor series expansion of pulse phase by minimizing the weighted rms of timing residuals ( observed minus computed phase ) .",
    "this yields precise values of pulsar rotation frequency @xmath8 , its derivative @xmath9 , and celestial coordinates .",
    "many young pulsars , including , experience rotational instabilities , and in the presence of such `` timing noise '' particular care must be taken in order to minimize contamination of fitted parameters . following the prescription of arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we first `` whiten '' the timing residuals , by fitting for position , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and higher frequency derivatives as required ( @xmath10 in this case ) .",
    "the resulting celestial coordinates and uncertainties are our best estimates of these parameters and are listed in table  [ tab : parms ] , as are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which we determine from one additional fit with position held fixed and @xmath10 set to zero .",
    "we then perform one final fit which includes @xmath10 .",
    "this is _ not _ a term describing the secular evolution of the neutron star rotation , but results from rotational instability in the pulsar .",
    "in fact , both the sign and magnitude of @xmath10 strongly suggest that it mostly represents recovery from a glitch that occurred prior to the discovery of the pulsar ( cf .",
    "the timing residuals corresponding to the solution presented in table  [ tab : parms ] , based on 1.5yr of data , are shown in figure  [ fig : prof_res ] .",
    "= 8truecm    with period @xmath11ms and a high @xmath12 , psr j1016@xmath75857 s inferred characteristic age , @xmath13kyr , is relatively small and its spin - down luminosity , @xmath14ergs@xmath3 , large . the surface dipole magnetic field strength is @xmath15 g ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "these parameters make it similar to the small number of `` vela - like '' pulsars , which have @xmath16@xmath17yr and @xmath18ergs@xmath3 .",
    "prior to the parkes multibeam survey , only nine such pulsars were known .",
    "thus far we have already doubled this number .",
    "pulsars in this group have high levels of glitch activity , and many are associated with pwne and/or snrs .",
    "is located , at least in projection , near the supernova remnant  ( msh  10@xmath75_3 _ ; @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : snr ] ) .",
    "snr  is an incomplete radio shell with non - thermal spectrum and with significant polarization , interacting with molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar is located exactly at the very tip of a `` finger '' of emission on the western edge of the remnant , and @xmath19 from the snr s approximate geometrical center .    in the galactic plane ,",
    "the spatial density of snrs and pulsars is high , so the fact that a young pulsar lies near the edge of a snr does not necessarily imply that they are associated : the probability of finding a pulsar lying by chance within @xmath20 of a snr center in this region of the galaxy ( @xmath21 ) is about 5% ( cf .",
    "however , the morphology of this particular pairing appears to bear a resemblance to that of psr  b1757@xmath724 ( another vela - like pulsar ) and its associated snr  g5.4@xmath71.2 ( `` the duck '' ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the pulsar has apparently caught up with , penetrated and overtaken the rim of its snr , leaving a trail in its wake ; the pulsar is now embedded in a ram - pressure confined ( bow - shock ) pwn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because of the limited resolution and sensitivity of the most data shown in figure  [ fig : snr ] , it can not yet be determined whether a similar association exists between  and snr  . nevertheless , the location of  at the tip of a bright structure connected to  is suggestive of a physical association between the pulsar and snr .",
    "= 8truecm    if the pulsar and snr are associated , the pulsar is at the distance of the snr , @xmath22kpc , on the near side of the carina spiral arm , as determined from optical and co line observations with an uncertainty of only @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this distance is smaller than that inferred from the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) and a model for the free electron distribution in the galaxy , @xmath24kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the model is at its most uncertain along spiral arm tangents , the direction of , so that the discrepancy may not be as serious as it appears .",
    "a similar example is provided by the recently discovered @xmath25-yr - old pulsar j1119@xmath76127 ( @xcite ) and its clearly associated snr g292.2@xmath70.5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where the model puts the pulsar at @xmath26kpc , when in fact it lies at @xmath27kpc .",
    "hypothesizing the /snr  association , we consider @xmath22kpc hereafter .",
    "the age of  is estimated by ruiz & may ( 1986 ) as @xmath28kyr , by fitting line profiles observed from an optical filament to models of interstellar radiative shocks .",
    "this is similar to the pulsar s characteristic age , @xmath29kyr .",
    "pulsar characteristic ages are not necessarily accurate estimates of true age @xmath30 : e.g. , in the b1757@xmath724/g5.4@xmath71.2 system , @xmath31 ( @xcite ) , while for the pulsar in snr  g11.2@xmath70.3 , @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "still , if the /  association is real , and the age of the system is @xmath33 , we can estimate the velocity required for the pulsar to move ballistically from its putative birthplace ( snr center ) to its present location : @xmath34kms@xmath3 .",
    "this velocity is within the range expected for young neutron stars ( @xcite ) , but is highly supersonic in the local ism .",
    "a characteristic bow - shock pwn is then expected , as is observed for psr  b1757@xmath724 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a bow - shock nebula , of typical extent @xmath35 , could not be seen in figure  [ fig : snr ] .",
    "furthermore , the larger - scale finger connecting to the snr need not point in the direction of motion , since the `` wake '' left behind by the pulsar can be distorted by ism motions and turbulence .",
    "finally , in comparing the /  and psr  b1757@xmath724/g5.4@xmath71.2 systems , we note that the pulsars are uncannily alike : @xmath36ms , @xmath37kyr , @xmath38ergs@xmath3 , @xmath39 g .",
    "energetic young pulsars such as  often produce detectable high - energy emission , especially if their distance is not too large ( as we have argued in the previous section ) .",
    "a search of the heasarc archive for serendipitous high - energy observations of  has yielded one pointing at snr  , obtained with the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) on - board the _",
    "einstein observatory_. the ipc is sensitive to 0.14.5kev x - rays over its @xmath40 field - of - view with an image resolution of @xmath41@xmath42 . the standard processed image from this 1.9ks exposure ( seq .",
    "i5288 ) , acquired on 1980 february 5 , is shown in figure  [ fig : einstein ] .",
    "the pulsar position is near the center of the ipc field and coincides with an excess of localized x - ray emission , the most significant in the field .",
    "this emission is consistent , given the limited number of counts , with a point source , with possible extended emission . from the original event data files , we extracted 134 counts from a @xmath43 circle around the peak of emission and estimated the background counts within a surrounding annulus at @xmath44 .",
    "the 45 background - subtracted counts yield a source significance of 4.8@xmath45 and a centroid which is @xmath46 offset from the radio position . while much larger than the nominal  pointing error ( @xmath47 ) , this offset is consistent with the ipc instrumental measurement error and the small number statistics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to estimate the luminosity of the source we assume a typical pulsar power - law model with photon index @xmath48 , as might be appropriate for magnetospheric emission or origin in a non - thermal nebula . a measure of the galactic neutral hydrogen column density to the pulsar is estimated from the hi study of dickey & lockman  ( 1990 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath49@xmath50 , consistent with the rule of thumb of 0.1 free electrons per h atom and the pulsar s dm .",
    "for isotropic emission , we obtain an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of l@xmath51ergs@xmath3 .",
    "this represents an efficiency for conversion of rotation - driven luminosity into x - rays of @xmath52 in the  band .",
    "such an efficiency for the point source and any compact nebula surrounding it is consistent within uncertainties with that observed for young pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "= 8truecm    given the limitations of the detection , the origin of the observed emission is not certain at present .",
    "possible contributions include emission from : a point source ( e.g. , pulsed magnetospheric emission ) ; a compact nebula ( bow - shock or static ) ; the snr ; or even interaction of the snr with a molecular cloud ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the pulsar position , the a2 star hd  302636 , @xmath41 away . if this star were a supergiant it would lie outside the galaxy , while if it is a main - sequence a2v star it lies at @xmath53kpc .",
    "at such a distance , the flux measured from the  source would imply a luminosity in excess of that known for any a2v star . ] .",
    "however , the inferred flux is in excess of the thermal emission expected from a @xmath54kyr - old neutron star for a reasonable @xmath55 , while the measured flux is approximately as expected from a pwn in such a pulsar system .",
    "also , if the extended emission is real , it appears to point back towards the center of the snr , suggestive of a ram - pressure confined wind nebula .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : einstein ] ,  and the  x - ray source are within the @xmath56 error box of  source .",
    "this @xmath6-ray source has flux @xmath57 photons@xmath50s@xmath3 ( @xmath58mev ) , and photon index @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this photon index is slightly larger than for most @xmath6-ray pulsars , but consistent with those of the crab ( @xmath60 ) , and the vela - like psr  j2229 + 6114 ( @xmath61 ) , which is almost certainly the source of the @xmath6-rays from 3eg  j2227 + 6122 ( @xcite ) .",
    "is possibly a composite source ( @xcite ) , in which case the photon index of any pulsar component may be different from the nominal value , and its flux will be lower than that listed .",
    "the source is not obviously variable ( @xcite ) , and the flux integrated from 100mev to 10gev with the nominal photon index corresponds to an isotropic luminosity @xmath62ergs@xmath3 , or @xmath63 .",
    "the chance probability for superposition of a vela - like pulsar and an  error box in the galactic plane is not negligible : in the 1500 square degrees covered by the parkes multibeam survey , where there are about 10 vela - like pulsars known ,  error boxes cover 24 square degrees or 1.6% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chance probability that at least one of those pulsars is aligned with one of the error boxes is therefore @xmath64 .",
    "the actual probability is somewhat smaller if one considers only non - variable  sources , but it is nevertheless significant .",
    "however , both @xmath65 and @xmath66 are approximately as expected for a pulsar of the age and @xmath67 of  ( e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite ) , as is the lack of variability in @xmath6-rays . also , every pulsar with a value of @xmath68 greater than that of  has been detected in @xmath6-rays ( although the distances of  as well as those of other pulsars are substantially uncertain ) . altogether",
    ", this makes an association between  and  possible and intriguing . the proof that  is the @xmath6-ray counterpart of  would come from the detection of @xmath6-ray pulsations .",
    "this will be difficult with  data , since the timing noise of the pulsar and the likelihood of glitches (   [ sec : psr ] ) prevent the reliable backwards extrapolation of the ephemeris required to search for @xmath6-ray pulsations .",
    "we have discovered an energetic and youthful pulsar , apparently located just outside snr  . based on its spin characteristics ,",
    "belongs to the rare class of vela - like pulsars , those with @xmath69@xmath17yr and @xmath18ergs@xmath3 .",
    "these pulsars are of particular interest , as many are embedded in pwne and are observed to be interacting with their snrs . additionally , such pulsars are very efficient at converting their spin - down luminosity into @xmath6-rays , and form the majority of  sources identified with pulsars",
    ".    we have argued , based on its positional coincidence with one notable feature in the snr , that  may be interacting with , and therefore that the two objects are physically associated . further supporting this notion is the detection of an x - ray source nearby  and the positionally coincident unidentified @xmath6-ray source .",
    "the luminosities of both x- and @xmath6-ray sources , if located at the distance of , are consistent with provenance from .    confirming",
    "this picture will require high - resolution radio and x - ray observations that show the proposed interaction between pulsar and snr .",
