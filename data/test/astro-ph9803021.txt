    "the firas ( far  infrared  absolute  spectrophotometer ) instrument aboard the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) satellite ( boggess  1992 and references therein ; mather , fixsen , & shafer 1993 ) was designed to measure the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the galaxy , and the far infrared background ( firb ) .",
    "the firas instrument and calibration are discussed by mather , fixsen & shafer ( 1993 ) and fixsen  ( 1994b ) .",
    "the firas observations of the cmb are discussed by mather  ( 1990 , 1994 ) , and fixsen  ( 1994a , 1996 , 1997a ) .",
    "the firas observations of the galaxy are discussed in wright  ( 1991 ) , bennett  ( 1994 ) , and reach  ( 1995 ) .",
    "puget  ( 1996 ) used the pass 3 firas observations to make a tentative background determination simular to one of the methods used here .    at frequencies below @xmath8 20 @xmath1 ( 500 ) ,",
    "the firb is overwhelmed by the cmb .",
    "however , the cmb can be subtracted from the data since its emission is spatially uniform , and it has a planck spectrum .",
    "the dipole anisotropy of the cmb must be included but the other anisotropy is not large enough to be a problem . at frequencies above @xmath8 100 @xmath1 ( 100 ) , beyond the firas range ,",
    "the observed spectrum is dominated by the zodiacal emission , which is much more complex , since its intensity and spectrum are spatially varying . in between these frequencies , the observed spectrum is dominated by galactic emission , which can be identified by its distinct ( from zodiacal ) spectrum , and its spatial variation over the sky .",
    "after the subtraction of these foreground emissions , any isotropic residual emission may still contain a uniform component from the solar system or the galaxy , which must be estimated and separated from the firb . in this paper",
    "we examine three methods , which give a consistent result for the firb .",
    "the firas pass 4 data consist of spectra between 2 and 96 @xmath1 ( 5000 to 104  wavelength ) in each of 6063 pixels on the sky ( there are 6144 pixels in the full sky ) with 210 frequency bins per spectrum .",
    "they were calibrated using the method described by fixsen  ( 1994b ) , with the improvements noted by fixsen  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the pass 4 firas data have lower noise and lower systematic errors than the previous firas data releases ( firas explanatory supplement ) .",
    "a weighted average of all of the firas data was used for this analysis .",
    "random uncertainties are @xmath9 mjy / sr ( @xmath10@xmath1 ) and up to 2 mjy / sr at @xmath11 for 10% of the sky .",
    "systematic uncertainties are approximately the same magnitude .",
    "the small instrumental offsets deduced from the cold external calibrator are what allow this absolute measurement .",
    "the instrumental uncertainties are small relative to the uncertainties associated with the foreground removal .",
    "we use data from the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) ( dirbe explanatory supplement ) to sort and analyze the firas data , and to subtract the dirbe@xmath12determined zodiacal dust emission ( kelsall   1998 ) extrapolated to the firas frequencies , from the firas data .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) emission from interplanetary dust particles is a minor contributor to the firas emission and then only in the higher ( @xmath13 70 @xmath1 ) frequency channels .",
    "this emission component is removed from the data by using the model developed from the analysis of the dirbe data ( kelsall  1998 ) .",
    "the major challenge facing the search for the firb in the firas data is the removal of galactic emission .",
    "we have used three different and complementary methods for separating the galactic emission from the firb .",
    "the first relies on the spatial variability of the galactic emission component . assuming a spatially invariant spectral shape ( i.e. color ) for this component",
    ", we use its spatially varying intensity to distinguish it from the isotropic firb .",
    "the second method uses h  i 21 cm and [ c  ii ] ( 157.7 ) line emission , which trace the atomic and ionized gas components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as templates for the galactic emission component .",
    "the third method uses the dirbe 140 and 240  detections of the firb ( hauser  1998 ) to define templates of galactic emission .",
    "each of these methods relies on some assumptions , and therefore has its shortcomings .",
    "however , the assumptions underlying each method are different , so the similarity between the derived firb spectra suggests that this spectrum represents a robust estimate of the firb .",
    "the firas sky spectra , @xmath14 , are a function of frequency @xmath15 and position \\{@xmath16 , @xmath17 } , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are galactic coordinates .",
    "since the data are binned into discrete pixels , @xmath18 , and frequencies , @xmath15 , we can also write the firas intensity in each pixel as @xmath19 . as the first step in the analysis we sort the sky into 10 bins .",
    "the first bin is the 10% of the sky which is darkest according to the dirbe 100  map , which has had the zodiacal emission removed with the dirbe zodiacal model .",
    "the next bin is the next 10% , etc . since the dirbe data are independent of the firas data we have introduced no noise biases by this sorting . since the amount of firas calibration data is about 10% of the sky data one can think of them as a zeroth bin . because the calibration uncertainties of the firas data are of the same magnitude as the random uncertainties in 10% of the sky , there is little to be gained by averaging more than 10% of the sky .",
    "we form the average intensity in each bin @xmath20 , @xmath21 , using the pixel weights of the firas data .",
    "a map of the sky bins is shown in fig 1 .",
    "the sorting is primarily based on the intensity of galactic emission .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in fig 2a .",
    "several items are apparent from the figure : ( 1 ) the cmb radiation dominates below 20 @xmath1 ; ( 2 ) zodiacal emission is evident above @xmath8 70 @xmath1 , especially in the lower intensity bins ; ( 3 ) between these frequencies the emission is dominated by the galaxy , which has a similar spectrum in all bins , particularly in the dimmer bins ; ( 4 ) the [ c  ii ] ( 63 @xmath1 ; 158 ) line is apparent in all spectra ; and ( 5 ) the [ n  ii ] line ( 48 @xmath1 ; 205 ) line is visible in the brighter bins and the brighter bins have a higher proportion of high frequency radiation ( they are warmer ) . although noise is evident in the dimmer bins , the signal to noise ratio in the 20 to 70 @xmath1 frequency interval is good for all bins .",
    "figure 2b shows the spectra of the bins after the removal of the cmb and the zodiacal dust emission .",
    "the cmb model is made from the low frequency firas data , while the zodiacal model is determined from the dirbe data ( see kelsall  1998 ) .",
    "the zodiacal dust model was interpolated and extrapolated from the dirbe 240  and 140  zodiacal models to the firas frequencies , except that for frequencies below 40 @xmath1 the slope was steepened by multiplying by a factor @xmath22 for frequencies between 20 and 40 @xmath1 .",
    "below 20 @xmath1 no zodiacal correction was made .",
    "there is no evidence of zodiacal emission below 20 @xmath1 in any analysis , so the zodiacal spectrum must steepen between 20 @xmath1 and 60 @xmath1",
    ".    the cmb model must be good to more than 3 orders of magnitude for the low frequency galactic spectra to emerge .",
    "the effect of the cmb dipole ( also shown in fig 2a ) must also be included in the cmb model .",
    "in contrast the zodiacal emission contributes only a small fraction to the emission at frequencies below 80  @xmath1 , and we can tolerate 20% errors in its estimate .",
    "the spectrum of bin 1 ( the faintest 10% of the sky ) provides a very robust upper limit on the firb . the signal to noise ratio is high and the systematic errors are small relative to the signal .",
    "but this is an upper limit , not a detection .",
    "we model the average intensity in each bin as a sum of two components , a uniform component , @xmath23 , and a spatially varying galactic component , @xmath24 , that may be spectrally distinct from @xmath23 .",
    "the average intensity in each bin is then    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is a uniform spectrum containing the firb , @xmath27 is the galactic spectrum and @xmath28 is a parameter that determines its intensity in the @xmath20th bin .",
    "there are two degrees of freedom that are unconstrained in this fit . for a given solution @xmath29",
    ", there exists a family of solutions : @xmath30 that provide identical fits to \\{@xmath31}. the two degrees of freedom are represented by an additive component to the uniform spectrum , and a scaling parameter for the galactic spectrum .",
    "two additional constraints provide a unique solution to eq .",
    "first , the background must be positive , so one solution , @xmath32 is chosen with @xmath33 so that @xmath34 is at most 2 @xmath35 negative at any frequency .",
    "second , we scale the galactic spectrum in terms of its value in the dimmest bin ( @xmath20=1 ) , @xmath36 . with this choice , the family of solutions is expressed as @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 , otherwise the background @xmath23 is brighter than the intensity @xmath39 in the dimmest 10% of the sky .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 , otherwise @xmath23 falls below the 2@xmath35 negative value .",
    "we estimate a value of @xmath41 .",
    "a lower value is unlikely because it ( weakly ) implies a negative background at some frequencies .",
    "a higher value unnecessarily ascribes to the background , radiation which is fit equally well with the known galactic foreground .",
    "also if @xmath42 is larger , the galactic [ c  ii ] line is clearly visible in the background spectrum .",
    "nominally the uncertainty in @xmath42 would be 0.1 but in view of the systematic nature of the possible errors a @xmath35 of 0.2 is appropriate .",
    "should there be a systematic variation of temperature with intensity it would couple with the assumption of a single color for the galactic emission leading to errors in the calculated background shape and intensity .",
    "part or all of the  observed \" background could be due to this effect for this method .",
    "when small bins are used there is an indication that the temperature is variable , and the temperature depends on galactic longitude .",
    "the spectrum of the galactic plane is different from that of the high latitude galaxy , but using the faintest 20 to 80% of the sky gives the same results to a good approximation . the decomposition for the faintest 50% of the sky is shown in figure 3a .",
    "the noise of the firas data increases with frequency and at frequencies @xmath43  @xmath1 may be affected by zodiacal emission .",
    "the feature at @xmath44  @xmath1 is in the low weight data between the low and high frequency channels of the firas and is not significant .",
    "the galactic foreground emission is estimated and removed by subtracting the fraction of the observed emission that correlates with templates of the galactic ir emission .",
    "the h  i 21 cm and [ c  ii ] 158  lines are good candidates for such templates because they are definitely of galactic origin , they are both strong , and nearly fully sampled across the sky . while they may not correspond directly to the neutral and ionized gas phases , they are not perfectly correlated with each other and if they are differently associated with the different ism phases then linear combinations of them could be used to trace the emission of the neutral and ionized gas , the major components that give rise to the high latitude galactic fir emission ( reach  1995 ) .",
    "the h  i map was used by puget  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we use the at&t bell laboratories h  i survey map from stark  ( 1992 ) convolved with the firas beam .",
    "the [ c  ii ] map is from the firas so it already has the right beam profile and sky coverage .",
    "we have also tested an [ n  ii ] 205  template , from the firas data , but at high latitude the [ n  ii ] emission is small and there is no significant correlation .",
    "for both the h  i and the [ c  ii ] maps the zero point is not a significant uncertainty .",
    "the relation between the line emission and the continuum emission is a far larger uncertainty .",
    "the relation between h  i and the ir emission is clearly not linear . at moderate h",
    "i column densities the molecular mass fraction of a cloud becomes significant , and ir emission from the molecular gas causes an excess of ir emission over that expected from the h  i - ir correlation plot ( boulanger  1996 , spaans & neufeld 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore include a quadratic term in h  i in the fit , as well as the [ c  ii ] emission as a second tracer .",
    "both line maps are renormalized to an average value of 1 over the faintest half of the sky .",
    "the intensity in a given sky pixel is : @xmath45 where @xmath18 is the sky pixel index , @xmath46 is the h  i map , @xmath47 is the [ c  ii ] map and @xmath48 are spectra determined from the fit ( the @xmath26 is again the background but not necessarily that of section 3.1 ) .",
    "the linear term is small indicating that the quadratic term absorbs most of the power . even though the linear term is negative at some frequencies the combination of linear plus quadratic is positive .",
    "we must eliminate the brightest 2/3 of the sky and the south polar region as we have no h  i data with well accurate sidelobe corrections there .",
    "these limit the fit to @xmath49 of the sky in order to get a stable fit .",
    "the fit to the [ c  ii ] map is quite stable over a wide range of cutoffs but the @xmath50 spectrum fit , even with the inclusion of the quadratic term , is only stable over the dimmest parts of the sky .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figure 3b .    since the relation between the h  i and the galactic emission is not linear",
    "there is a concern that a quadratic is not the right answer either .",
    "forcing the fit to be linear and cutting enough data to make it fit leaves a very short lever arm for the extrapolation .",
    "the [ c  ii ] picks up other radiation but there still might be more galactic radiation not traced by either the h  i or [ c  ii ] .",
    "the expected noise of the fit spectra is evident .",
    "this is exaggerated by the high correlation between the @xmath46 and @xmath51 .",
    "still there is a clear signal at lower frequencies .      in many ways",
    "the easiest approach is to use the dirbe maps and extragalactic background detections at 140 and 240  to determine the firb from the firas data . adopting the dirbe firb backgrounds ( hauser  1998 ) at 140 and 240  of 1.17 and 1.12 mjy / sr respectively",
    ", we construct galactic emission templates by subtracting these backgrounds from the zodiacal light subtracted dirbe maps convolved with the firas beam .",
    "this combination has already been shown to model the galaxy quite well over a large part of the sky ( fixsen  1997a ) .",
    "we represent the pixel intensity at each firas frequency @xmath15 in terms of a linear combination of the two dirbe templates as follows :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , the dirbe background and map intensity at firas pixel @xmath18 , at wavelength @xmath55 . by correlating the firas map to both the 140 and 240  dirbe templates , we allow for temperature variations in the galactic foreground .",
    "the background is obtained by extrapolating the correlations with the dirbe templates to the dirbe background values of @xmath53 .",
    "figure 3c presents the results of the fit . to be consistent with the other fits , we plot the results for the dimmest half of the sky",
    "however , the result is very robust and essentially identical results can be obtained for any region of the sky that excludes the galactic plane .",
    "of course the uncertainties in the dirbe firb determination at 140 and 240   propagate the determination of the firb here . we have shown ( fixsen 1997b ) that the firas and dirbe calibrations are consistent , so it is not surprising that the two data sets give consistent results when the amplitude of the background determination for the dirbe is assumed .",
    "the dirbe maps are only used to determine the _ galaxy _ model ; the isotropic component need not have been consistent with the firas determination so this method is partially independent .",
    "the three methods just described have different assumptions , weaknesses and strengths .",
    "the first method assumes that the galactic spectrum is fixed , and that only its intensity varies with position .",
    "temperature variations are observed to occur on various scales ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ; firas exp sup 1997 ; lagache et al .",
    "based on the dirbe analysis , we expect these variations to have a only a small effect on our results .",
    "the dirbe high latitude data at 240  were analyzed using both a single- and a variable - spectrum model to describe the galactic foreground emission ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) , with no significant difference in the derived background .",
    "the second method does not assume a fixed galactic spectrum , but almost all of the power in the fit is in a single component indicating that there is little systematic correlation of temperature with intensity of the h  i 21 cm line .",
    "this method solves directly for the dust emission from the dominant neutral and ionized phases of the ism .",
    "it therefore avoids a potential problem of the third method ( which relies on the dirbe analysis ) using backgrounds derived from the ir - to - h  i correlation only .",
    "two problems with this method are , that at the firas resolution , the correlation between the ir and the h  i line intensity is non - linear and that it ignores the molecular regions .",
    "the first was treated by using a quadratic fit to the relation .",
    "this choice is not unique , but it is supported by observations of the ir to h  i correlation in the galaxy ( dalloglio et al .",
    "1985 ; reach , koo , & heiles 1994 ) . molecular clouds are less abundant at the high galactic latitudes that are used here .",
    "the third method relies on the accuracy of the dirbe determination of the firb .",
    "the main uncertainty in the background determination are those associated with the determination of the foreground emission , and they are discussed in detail by hauser et al .",
    "the use of a dirbe template for the firas background determination introduces another uncertainty , namely the consistency between the firas and dirbe calibration .",
    "fixsen et al .",
    "( 1997b ) show that the most significant difference in the calibration is in the 240  dirbe band , but using the firas instead of the dirbe calibration for that band introduces a very small change in the background , from a value of 13.6 to 12.7 nw m@xmath6 sr@xmath7 ( hauser et al . 1998 ) .",
    "overall , the three methods yield a consistent spectrum for the firb , an encouraging result considering the substantial differences in the three approaches ( see fig 4a )",
    ". the weaknesses of each method are compensated by the other methods .",
    "the color method assumes a single spectrum , but the other methods allow for color variation in the galactic foreground .",
    "the line emission method uses a quadratic fit over 25% of the sky , but the other methods use linear fits which are insensitive to the fraction of sky .",
    "the dirbe method only uses the correlation between h  i and the foreground in small regions , but the line emission method includes ionized gas and the color method makes no assumptions about the gas .    in all three firb spectra the background peaks at @xmath56@xmath1 ( @xmath57 ) , and exhibits a definite turnover at the higher frequencies .",
    "the higher frequencies are more affected by both noise and systematic effects .",
    "the average of the three spectra can be fit by :      in the 5 to 80 @xmath1 frequency range ( @xmath55 between 125 and 2000 ) where @xmath59@xmath1 , and @xmath60 is the familiar planck function .",
    "the uncertainties are highly correlated , with correlations of .98 for the intensity and index , @xmath12.99 for the intensity and temperature . and @xmath12.95 for the index and temperature .",
    "figure 4b compares the analytical fit to the firb derived here , to the tentative background derived by puget et al .",
    "the spectra differ significantly at @xmath61@xmath1 , probably the result of the difference in subtraction of dust emission related to h@xmath62 .",
    "the crosses in the figure represent the nominal dirbe detections at 140 and 240 , while the diamonds represent the dirbe detections using the firas calibration .",
    "while the effect of the firas calibration is larger at 140 , the uncertainty in the calibration is larger at this wavelength .",
    "so , the firb derived here is consistent with that derived by the dirbe , within the uncertainty of the dirbe@xmath12firas calibration .",
    "the range of values for the firb at 100  represent the upper limit derived by kashlinsky , mather , & odenwald ( 1996 ) from a fluctuation analysis of the 100  dirbe maps and the lower limit is derived by dwek et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from the 140 and 240  dirbe detections .",
    "dwek  ( 1998 ) show that the uniform dirbe residuals can not be produced by any local ( solar system or galactic ) emission sources .",
    "hence , the uniform residual derived here is most likely of extragalactic origin .",
    "the total flux received in this wavelength region is 14 nw m@xmath6 sr@xmath7 , or about 20% of the total expected flux of about 70 nw m@xmath6sr@xmath7 associated with the production of metals throughout the history of the universe in some models ( dwek  1998 ) .",
    "we thank the many people involved in processing the firas data .",
    "we thank the dirbe team for helpful discussions and the zodiacal model , g. hinshaw for help in producing the plots , and the referee , w reach for his helpful comments .",
