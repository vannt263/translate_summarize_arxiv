    "the discovery of very bright quasars , with luminosities @xmath10 , at redshift @xmath11 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) suggests that some smbhs as massive as a few@xmath12 already existed when the universe was less than 1 gyr old ( see , e.g. , fan 2006 for a review ) .",

    "this makes it difficult to reach @xmath16 without a phase of rapid ( super  eddington ) accretion , unless a list of optimistic assumptions are made in hierarchical merger models , in which multiple seed bhs are allowed to grow without interruption , and to combine into a single smbh ( haiman 2004 ; yoo & miralda - escud 2004 ; bromley et al .",

    "2008 ) , or a `` quasistar '' ( begelman et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these so  called `` direct collapse '' models involve metal  free gas in relatively massive ( @xmath18 ) dark matter halos at redshift @xmath19 , with virial temperatures @xmath0k .",
    "the gas that cools and collapses in these halos must avoid fragmentation , shed angular momentum efficiently , and collapse rapidly .",

    "( 2010 ) found that the gas in such halos , when collapsing in isolation , forms @xmath4 efficiently , and cools to temperatures of @xmath21 k. although no fragmentation was seen , the gas could ultimately fragment on smaller scales that have not yet been resolved ( e.g. turk et al . 2009 ) .",
    "more importantly , even if fragmentation was avoided , the cold gas flows inward at low velocities , near the sound speed of @xmath22 , with a correspondingly low accretion rate of @xmath23 .",
    "this results in conditions nearly identical to those in the cores of lower - mass minihalos ; extensive ultra  high resolution simulations have concluded that the gas then forms a single @xmath24 star ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",

    "2010 ; see also omukai 2001 and bromm & loeb 2003 who found similar , but somewhat higher values ) , which exceeds the expected level of the cosmic uv background at high redshifts .",
    "only a small subset of all @xmath0k halos , which have unusually close and bright neighbors , may see a sufficiently high flux ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2008 ) . in order to avoid fragmentation",
    ", the gas in these halos must also remain essentially free of any metals and dust ( omukai et al .",
    "2008 ) , which may be incompatible with the presence of such nearby luminous galaxies .    in this paper , we consider a different possibility to keep the gas warm , relying on heating by a primordial magnetic field .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to produce a global primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) , with a field strength of order 1 ( comoving ) ng , during inflation and/or during various phase transitions in the early universe ( see , e.g. widrow 2002 and references therein ) . if present , the pmf can be strongly amplified by flux  freezing inside a collapsing primordial gas , affecting @xmath4formation and cooling .",
    "sethi et al . ( 2008 ; hereafter s08 ) have shown that 0.2 - 2 ng fields can significantly enhance the @xmath4 fraction during the early stages of collapse .",
    "schleicher et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found similar results , and emphasized that at the high densities ( @xmath35 ) corresponding to later stages of the collapse , magnetic heating from 0.1 - 1ng fields results in significantly elevated temperatures .    in this paper , we consider field strengths higher than those in the two previous studies by s08 and schleicher et al .",
    "our main result is that , in analogy with the uv  irradiation , there exists a critical magnetic field , which leads to a bifurcation of behaviors .",
    "if the pmf has a strength above @xmath36 ng , then the collapsing gas is kept warm ( @xmath1 k ) until it reaches the critical density @xmath3 at which the roto  vibrational states of @xmath4 approach local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "@xmath4cooling then remains inefficient , and the temperature stays near @xmath5k , even as the gas collapses further . on the other hand if @xmath37 , @xmath4cooling is delayed , but the gas eventually cools down below @xmath38k .",
    "the critical magnetic field strength we find is a factor of @xmath39two higher than the existing upper limit from the cmb anisotropies ( yamazaki 2010 ; see more discussion in   5 below ) .",
    "however , it can be realized in the rare @xmath7 regions of the spatially fluctuating @xmath8field .",
    "as we argue , the abundance of halos located in these high  field regions is sufficient to explain the number of the @xmath9 quasars observed in the sdss .",
    "the thermal and ionization history of gas collapsing into a high  redshift halo , in the presence of a primordial magnetic field , is described in detail in s08 .",
    "the dissipation of the magnetic field owing to ambipolar diffusion and to decaying turbulence in the post recombination era can substantially alter the ionization fraction and temperature of the gas , even beginning before the halo collapse ( sethi & subramanian 2005 [ hereafter ss05 ] ; yamazaki et  al .",

    "we extend the analysis of s08 up to a higher particle density in the collapsing halo , and explore higher magnetic field strengths .",
    "in addition , we made the following changes : ( a ) we track the density evolution of gas in a collapsing halo with the model of dekel and birnboim ( 2006 ; this affects the compressional heating rate ) , ( b ) we updated the @xmath40 chemistry network ; specifically , we use the recent compilation in shang et  al .",

    "law dependence @xmath75 on the gas density with @xmath76 .",
    "in practice , this scaling may be less steep ; below we will explore how our results change for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "another important scale is the ( comoving ) magnetic jeans scale , @xmath77 ( see e.g. eq .  6 in ss05 and references therein ) .",
    "this scale , along with the thermal jeans scale determine the condition that allow a halo to be gravitationally unstable . in our case , the magnetic jeans scale is larger , and is therefore more restrictive , for @xmath78 ( s08 , figure  4 ) .",
    "primordial magnetic fields can also induce the formation of first structures in the universe ( wasserman 1978 , kim et  al .",
    "1996 , gopal and sethi 2003 , subramanian and barrow 1998a , ss05 ) .",
    "the total ( dark matter + gas ) mass of the first structures , determined by the magnetic jeans length , is @xmath79 ( e.g. figure  7 in ss05 ) .",
    "we show in figure  1 , 2 , and 3 the evolution of the temperature , the @xmath40 fraction ( defined as the ratio of the @xmath4 number density to the total hydrogen number density , @xmath80 ) , and the ionized fraction for a single halo from @xmath81 ( corresponding to the initial number density @xmath82 on the left of figures  1 , 2 , and 3 ) , down to a maximum density of @xmath83 in the collapsed halo .",
    "note that the evolution on these figures is monotonically to the right : the x  axis shows the density decreasing to the right ( until the turnaround redshift ) , and then increasing again as the halo collapses .",
    "the figures show the interplay between several physical effects .",
    "first , the magnetic field decay directly increases the temperature .",
    "this increases the collisional destruction rate of @xmath84 , but it also increases the electron fraction ( owing to more rapid collisional ionization ) .",
    "the larger electron fraction then tends to increase the molecular hydrogen fraction , competing with the effect of the increased collisional @xmath4dissociation .",
    "the molecular hydrogen cooling rate depends on the temperature directly , and also on the molecular hydrogen fraction .",
    "as the temperature reaches @xmath85k , atomic cooling dominates , which , again , is governed by the ionized fraction .",
    "figures  1 , 2 , and  3 should be viewed together to appreciate the net outcome of these effects on the thermal evolution , for different specific values of the magnetic field .",
    "a higher magnetic field strength generally results in more rapid heating , and therefore a higher temperature , at least until halo collapse begins .",
    "this , in turn results in higher ionized fractions .",
    "however , the thermal evolution is more complicated in the collapsing stage , once molecular hydrogen becomes the dominant coolant .",
    "prior to turnaround , the gas temperature increases roughly monotonically with the strength of the magnetic field , up to @xmath86k .",
    "however , since a higher temperature also means a higher ionized fraction ( fig .",
    "2 ) , molecular hydrogen forms at a faster rate . once the molecular hydrogen becomes the dominant coolant , at @xmath87 , the halo with a higher magnetic field can cool below the less magnetized halo .",
    "the most interesting case corresponds to @xmath88 ( shown by the thick solid black curves ) . in this case , the magnetic field dissipation rate is high enough to prevent the formation of molecular hydrogen in the collapsing halo .",
    "as seen in figure  2 , the molecular hydrogen starts getting destroyed in the collapsing halo in this case .",
    "the direct impact of this predicament on the thermal state of the gas is that the gas fails to cool via @xmath4  the cooling remains dominated by the line excitation of the atomic hydrogen .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with the results of schleicher et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) for @xmath89 , the range of magnetic field strengths they considered .",
    "we note that the molecular hydrogen fractions , past the turn  around epoch , are lower by more than an order of magnitude compared to the results of s08 .",
    "this is in line with the observation of schleicher et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) that s08 had underestimated the destruction rate of @xmath40 .",
    "the thermal evolution of the gas in the zero magnetic field case ( @xmath90 in the figures ) also agrees with the results of the one - zone models studied by omukai ( 2001 )",
    ".    the most important new result of our analysis is the thermal state of the gas owing to the destruction of the @xmath40 in the collapsing halo for @xmath91 .",
    "omukai ( 2001 ) analyzed the destruction of @xmath40 in the collapsing halo in the presence of background uv flux . that analysis suggested that the @xmath40 formation can be prevented if the halo could be kept at a temperature @xmath92 up to a critical density @xmath93 . at higher densities ,",
    "collisions with hydrogen atoms is more effective in destroying @xmath40 from higher vibration levels , because the relative occupation probability of vibration states of the @xmath40 molecular approach thermal equilibrium at these densities ( the rate @xmath57 in the discussion in section  2 , martin et  al .",
    "1996 ) . in the analysis of omukai ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the reaction rates are also affected by the presence of a background uv field .",
    "our analysis shows that the same result ( i.e. lack of any @xmath30 cooling ) can also be obtained by the dissipation of tangled magnetic fields .    in figures  4 and 5",
    ", we show the heating and cooling rates during the collapse regime , for two values of the magnetic field , 1 and 4  ng , respectively . apart from a brief initial period ,",
    "when atomic cooling roughly balances adiabatic heating , the dominant heating and cooling processes in the @xmath94 case , in the collapse stage , are magnetic heating and @xmath40 cooling , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 cooling quickly becomes more important than magnetic heating , resulting in a rapid temperature drop at densities near @xmath95 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as the halo collapses further , the gas begins to recombine and the ionized fraction decreases ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the magnetic field dissipation rate due to ambipolar diffusion increases as @xmath96 , while the @xmath50 cooling rate grows as @xmath97 . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic heating catches up with @xmath50 cooling , resulting in a nearly constant temperature ( see fig .  1 )",
    " however , this occurs only after the collapse has proceeded beyond the critical density @xmath98 .",
    "atomic cooling or adiabatic heating do not play an important role in the thermal evolution for this strength of the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath99 , as shown in figure 5 , the magnetic heating roughly balances atomic hi cooling during the collapse stage , resulting in a nearly constant temperature @xmath100k throughout the entire evolution of the contracting gas .",
    "the magnetic heating gives rise to a higher ionization fraction ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and therefore aids the formation of @xmath40 .",
    "however , the high temperature of the gas causes the @xmath40 to get destroyed ( fig .  2 ;",
    "this effect is also seen for @xmath101 just before the onset of the halo collapse ) .",
    "the net result for this high value of the magnetic field is that @xmath40 can not form fast enough to ever become an important coolant .",
    "the halo remains at a temperature @xmath102 up to the critical density ; as a result , the @xmath40 fraction is strongly diminished for the subsequent evolution of the halo . by experimenting with several intermediate values of the magnetic field , we have found that this clear  cut bifurcation in the thermal evolution occurs at a critical magnetic field strength of @xmath103 .    as noted in   2 above , we adopted the model of dekel and birnboim ( 2006 ) to track the density evolution of the collapsing halo .",
    "however , we have checked the robustness of our results against a wide range of collapse histories . specifically , after the turn  around stage , we artificially multiplied the rate of increase in the density , relative to the dekel & birnboim model , by a factor of 0.1 or 1 .",
    "we have found that the weaker / stronger adiabatic heating delayed / advanced the onset of the catastrophic @xmath4 cooling ( e.g. as seen at @xmath104 in fig.1 ) to higher / lower densities , but the other qualitative features of our results were essentially unchanged .",
    "in particular , a bifurcation of behaviors was still found , with a critical density of @xmath105 .",
    "another uncertainty concerns our assumption of flux  freezing .",
    "schleicher et  al . (",
    "2009 ) note the possibility of the breakdown of this approximation in a collapsing halo .",
    "if the field is not sufficiently tangled , collapse can occur with little dissipation in the direction of the field lines ; the magnetic field might grow less rapidly than our adopted @xmath106 .",
    "our computations in the range @xmath107 show that the critical magnetic field required to prevent the halo from cooling increases to @xmath108 .",
    "this also leads to the interesting possibility that the average @xmath109 , required to form smbhs , might be detectable by the future cmb experiments ( e.g. yamazaki et  al . 2010 ) and the @xmath110 fluctuations of the field might leave their trace in the formation of smbh .",
    "we hope to explore this possibility in the future .    at present ,",
    "the best upper limits on the pmf are in the range @xmath111 from cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies and from early structure formation ( subramanian & barrow 1998b , 2002 , durrer , ferreira & kahniashvili 2000 , seshadri & subramanian 2001 , mack , kahniashvili & kosowsky 2002 , lewis 2004 , gopal & sethi 2005 , kahniashvili & ratra 2005 , giovannini & kunze 2008 , yamazaki et  al .",

    "the upper limits from cmb on @xmath58 for this value of @xmath114 are considerably weaker ( lewis 2004 ) .",
    "we note that the effect we discuss here might be pronounced for a larger @xmath114 for a given @xmath58 .",
    "more detailed analysis would be required to directly compare our results with yamazaki et  al .",
    "our analysis suggests that for @xmath115 , the fragmentation of collapsing halos could be prevented , and therefore this could be considered an independent upper bound on the value of @xmath58 .",
    "the mass of the central object that forms in a collapsing proto ",

    "star , with the proto  stellar mass equal to the gas mass enclosed within this radius . for metal  free gas , @xmath117 is approximately @xmath118 years , with only a mild dependence on the proto  stellar mass ( schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "the expected mass of the central object then scales approximately as @xmath119 ( see , e.g. , shang et al .",
    "2010 for the last scalings with the sound speed and gas temperature ) .",
    "this implies that a stellar mass of @xmath120 , expected for @xmath121k , can increase to @xmath122 when @xmath4cooling is inefficient and @xmath123k ( in their three  dimensional simulations , shang et al .",
    "find a somewhat still steeper scaling ) .",
    "our proposal here is that a small fraction of halos at @xmath124 , which contain pristine , metal  free gas when they collapse , and which reside in regions of an unusually high initial seed magnetic field , may produce a smbh with a mass of up to @xmath125 .",
    "the time available between @xmath126 and @xmath124 is @xmath127 yrs , allowing for a further growth in mass by a factor of @xmath128 at the e  folding time of @xmath129 , ( corresponding to eddington  limited growth at the radiative efficiency 10% ) .",

    "the smallest total ( dark matter+gas ) mass that can collapse for @xmath132 is @xmath133 ( as mentioned in section  3 above ) .",
    "these halos could form either as a result of gravitational instability in the standard @xmath134cdm model , or via pmf  induced density perturbations ( for details on the latter scenario , see e.g. sb08 ) .",

    "such a small fraction could would correspond to @xmath148 upward fluctuations of a gaussian random pmf . because of the strong reduction of the relatively high  mass halos at higher redshift , essentially every @xmath147 halo would have to host smbhs at @xmath149 , to match the comoving abundance of @xmath126 quasar bhs .",
    "@xmath150 is therefore the earliest epoch for forming the heavy smbh seeds as envisioned here .",
    "as long as the pmf amplitude is @xmath151 , the critical flux we find , @xmath152 , would be reached by the @xmath153 upward fluctuations .    as mentioned above ,",
    "our results are analogous to earlier work , proposing that a uv flux keeps the gas hot , and results in smbh formation .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing two important differences in these two scenarios . first , as figure  1 shows , even though there is a clear critical @xmath8field value , dividing the thermal evolution into two different regimes , even for @xmath8field strengths below this value , the minimum temperature reached by the gas is significantly elevated .",
    "hence , sub  critical magnetic fields can still significantly increase the mass of the central object .",
    "second , the gas in the halos must remain essentially free of any metals and dust , in order to avoid fragmentation .",
    "this may well be impossible to reconcile with the large required flux , which has to arise from a close neighbor galaxy , in the uv  irradiation scenario .",
    "on the other hand , in the magnetic  heating case , there is a - priori reason why a region where the pmf has an upward fluctuation would be more likely to be metal enriched .",
    "in fact , quite the contrary : the large magnetic jeans mass will suppress the collapse of gas into lower ",
    "mass halos at high redshift , naturally excluding any prior metal ",
    "pollution farther up in the merger tree of the halo in which the putative smbh forms .",
    "we found a plausible novel mechanism to form high - redshift smbhs by direct gas collapse in early dark matter halos , aided by heating from the dissipation of a primordial magnetic field .",
    "the model avoids many of the assumptions required in earlier models ( such as an extremely high uv flux and the absence of @xmath4 and of other molecules and metals ) , but it does require a large primordial magnetic field , and relies on metal  free primordial gas .",
