    "the origin and formation process of the once enigmatic _",
    "solar _ mgiemission at 811.578 @xmath3  ( 12.3217  ) and 818.058  @xmath3  ( 12.2241  ) was first explained successfully and in detail by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter crs ) . by employing an extensive model atom of mgi  in a full non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) calculation , they concluded the emission lines were photospheric in origin .",
    "crs accounted excellently for the emission strengths of the mgi  lines , their complicated intensity profiles as a function of viewing angle on the solar disk , and the relative strengths of several mgi  lines , both in emission and absorption .",
    "furthermore , crs could explain the similar but weaker sii and ali emission features observed in the solar spectrum .",
    "@xcite successfully modeled these ali emission - features in the sun , showing that a similar nlte effect as for mgi  is responsible .",
    "@xcite were also able to reproduce the solar emission lines with a similar nlte analysis of magnesium in the solar photosphere .",
    "moreover , by including artificially reduced , inelastic , neutral - hydrogen collisions , they were also able to simultaneously model line cores of visual and near - infrared ( nir ) mgi  absorption - lines in the range of @xmath4 .",
    "the mgi  emission lines at 12  in the sun clearly show zeeman splitting and so trace the local magnetic field  @xcite . because zeeman splitting depends on the square of the wavelength while doppler broadening goes as the first power , mid - infrared lines better reveal zeeman splitting than optical or nir lines with the same land @xmath5-factor .",
    "thus , these lines potentially offer an excellent method for measuring stellar disk - averaged magnetic fields , and will be complementary to studies using nir lines in that they will probe other atmospheric layers and are more zeeman sensitive .",
    "in this paper we report on our detection and modeling of the mid - infrared mgi  emission features in procyon , an f5iv - v star .",
    "in the sun , the observed emission lines are formed as a result of a nlte flow cycle . as lines originating from high - excitation levels become optically thin in the photosphere , lower lying levels are overpopulated and subsequently photoionized .",
    "the mgii  reservoir refills the high - excitation levels via rydberg states of mgi , leading to the emission . from nlte calculations ,",
    "the relevant departures from boltzmann level - populations for the levels involved  @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the 811.6 @xmath3  line and @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the 818.1 @xmath3  line  are quite similar for both the upper and lower states .",
    "the departure coefficients of the upper levels are of the order of 10% larger than those of the lower states",
    ". however , this small difference between the level departures is the direct cause of the observed emission .",
    "we observed procyon with the texas echelon - cross - echelle spectrograph  ( texes , * ? ? ? * ) , a visitor instrument at the 3 m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "the raw data were collected during november 2000 , november 2001 , december 2002 , december 2003 , and january 2004 .",
    "separate grating settings were required for each mgi  line .",
    "we used the cross - dispersed , high spectral resolution mode for all observations .",
    "observations of unresolved line sources indicate that the core of the line profile at this wavelength is reasonably reproduced with a gaussian with fwhm @xmath10  kms@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and wings that are slightly broader than gaussian .",
    "data acquisition and reduction followed the standard procedure described in  @xcite . to remove sky and telescope background ,",
    "procyon was nodded along the slit .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using telluric atmospheric lines ; previous experience shows this procedure typically gives accuracy better than 1  kms@xmath11 . after reducing a given data set , we normalized the continuum using a 6@xmath13 order legendre polynomial and then combined appropriate data files .",
    "procyon has almost no photospheric features at this wavelength so determining the continuum is easy and reliable .",
    "furthermore , the telluric atmosphere at the mgi  wavelengths is very clean .",
    "slight variations in wavelength setting from night - to - night result in increased noise where less data could be coadded .",
    "we have analyzed the procyon mgi  lines as crs successfully did for the mgi  lines in the sun .",
    "we use a one - dimensional , hydrostatic , flux - conserved , non - magnetic , lte model for the physical structure of the atmosphere .",
    "the model - atmosphere , including the specific , mean - intensity field at all depths , is calculated with the marcs code , which was first developed by @xcite and has been successively updated ever since ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .    for the line formation of mgi  and the spectral synthesis ,",
    "a full nlte calculation is performed using the program multi @xcite .",
    "our mgi  model atom was kindly provided by mats carlsson .",
    "we require our model to reproduce the excellent fits of the intensity profiles measured at different locations on the solar disk as presented in crs .",
    "we solve the equations of statistical equilibrium for the magnesium atom level populations at each of 66 levels , including 315 line transitions and 65 bound - free transitions ( ionization and recombination ) .",
    "one mgii  level is included .",
    "we calculate photoionization rates by incorporating the calculated specific , mean - intensity field for all depths from the model atmosphere .",
    "this treatment allows the full line - blanketing to be considered through ultraviolet wavelengths , which mainly affect the photoionization from the lowest states . for a further discussion , references for the atomic data , and the uncertainties in the modeled emission , see crs .",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters of procyon , needed in the calculation of the model atmosphere , are relatively well known .",
    "all parameters , except the metallicity , can be derived from direct measurements .",
    "recent works determining procyon s parameters include , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the parameters we have used are : an effective temperature of @xmath14  k , a surface gravity of @xmath15 ( cgs units ) , a mass of @xmath16 , and a radius of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the metallicity ( iron abundance ) of the star is slightly lower than solar .",
    "@xcite measures a slightly super - solar @xmath0-element abundance .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume a solar abundance mixture as given by @xcite .",
    "we model the atmosphere with a depth - independent micro - turbulence parameter of @xmath18 kms@xmath11 , in agreement with current literature .",
    "our model and observations are shown in figure  [ em_811 ] and [ em_818 ] . in order to match the line widths",
    ", we introduce the customary artifice of macroturbulent broadening , including the instrumental profile .",
    "we assume the broadening velocities have a gaussian distribution with a fwhm of @xmath19 , which is slightly larger than that given in @xcite .",
    "we find the model reproduces the disk - averaged observations within the modeling uncertainties . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will investigate our calculation by discussing the atomic model of mgiand the assumptions made in our nlte calculation , such as the collisional rates , atmospheric radiation field used and the validity of the assumption of atmospheric homogeneity .    in figure  [ dep_coeff ] , the departure coefficients ( defined as in crs ) of the relevant levels",
    "are plotted as a function of depth in the atmosphere , shown as the optical depth calculated in the continuum at 500  nm .",
    "the departure coefficients are very similar to the solar case , indicating that the same formation process of the mgi  emission lines is at play for procyon .",
    "following crs , we have included ` quasi - elastic _ l_-changing ' collisions with neutral particles , which keep all close - lying rydberg states with common principal quantum - numbers _",
    "n _ in relative thermalization .",
    "this means that the departure coefficients of the upper and lower states , respectively , of the two mgi  emission lines will follow each other exactly since they have the same _",
    "n _ quantum numbers .",
    "thus , in figure  [ dep_coeff ] the upper and lower levels of the two mgi  emission lines fall on top of each other .",
    "the lower levels depart more from lte . whereas for the sun the population of mgii  is slightly larger than that of lte , for procyon the mgii  population is very close to lte .",
    "the mgi  emission in procyon is only marginally larger than that of the sun .",
    "this fact can qualitatively be understood as follows .",
    "the higher temperatures in procyon compared to the sun , will lead to a larger ionization of magnesium , with a factor of ten less mgi  expected all through the line - forming regions .",
    "however , in the line - forming regions of procyon , the 500  k warmer temperatures compared to the sun , also lead to roughly a factor of ten more atoms excited to the levels involved in the formation of the emission line .",
    "since the departure coefficients for both procyon and the sun are quite similar , the resulting emission will be of the same order of magnitude , as observed .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that , with a nlte calculation using the crs model atom of magnesium , it is possible to reproduce mgi  emission lines at 12  successfully , not only for the sun but also for procyon .",
    "this is the first star , other than the sun , that this has been done for .",
    "future investigations of different types of stars , showing mgi  emission lines , will also be important .",
    "the mgi  emission lines should be useful tools for measuring stellar magnetic - fields through their zeeman splitting .",
    "after a decade of anticipation , high - resolution , mid - ir spectrographs , such as texes , at 8 - 10 m telescopes will now allow the use of the mgi  @xmath1 lines for stellar magnetic - field diagnostics .",
    "we thank m. carlsson for providing the mgi  model - atom used in this study .",
    "k. eriksson , b. gustafsson , d. kiselman , a. korn , and the referee are acknowledged for fruitful discussions .",
    "we are grateful for the help of j. lacy and t. greathouse of the texes team as well as the irtf staff .",
    "this work was supported in part by the swedish research councils vr and stint and nsf grant ast-0307497 .",
    "the construction of texes was supported by grants from the nsf and observing with texes was supported by the texas advanced research program ."
