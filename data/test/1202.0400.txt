    "the broad fe k@xmath19 fluorescent emission line in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , first clearly detected by asca @xcite , provides an important tracer to probe the physical conditions and geometrical distribution of matter in the vicinity of supermassive black hole .",
    "the line is believed from the accretion disk by reflecting the illuminating x - ray continuum , and the unique broad and skewed ( toward the red ) line profile is a consequence of the relativistic doppler effect and strong gravitational redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such broad fe k@xmath19 emission lines have been detected in a significant number of agns @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , in a few sources the red wing of the fe k@xmath19 emission line appears too broad to be produced from accretion disk surrounding schwarzschild black holes @xcite . in these cases , assuming the accretion disk extends to the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco , determined by the spin of black hole ) , fast rotating kerr black holes are required , for which the accretion disk could extend closer to the horizon thus stronger gravitational redshift could be produced @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fe k@xmath19 line profile enables astronomers to measure the spin of smbhs , which is otherwise extremely difficult or even impossible @xcite .",
    "till now , rotating smbhs have been claimed in a number of type 1 agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , strong debates exist on the nature of the ultra broad red wings , challenging the base of such measurements .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the observed broad and skewed line profile is artificial due to continuum curvature produced by more complex absorption ( e.g. partial covering ionized absorber , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although various efforts have been made to distinguish two scenarios , including performing spectral fitting over wider band to better determine the absorption and the underlying continuum @xcite , studying bare seyferts with no or very weak warm absorption @xcite , and monitoring the lag between reflection component and the continuum @xcite , a clear picture has not been obtained .",
    "meanwhile , type 2 agns could provide a different insight into the nature of broad  emission . according to unification model , type",
    "2 agns are viewed at higher inclination angle comparing with type 1 sources .",
    "furthermore , while ionized absorption , which plays the key role in the alternative scenario to the broad  line , is common in type 1 agns reynolds1997 , x - ray absorption in type 2 sources is dominated by cold matter . till now",
    ", broad  lines were detected only in a few type 2 agns ( see guainazzi et al .",

    "however , neither of the  line red wing in these type 2 agns is broad enough to demand a rotating smbh .",
    "iras 00521 - 7054  is a seyfert 2 galaxy at @xmath20 = 0.0689 . in this letter",
    "we present new xmm - newton observation on iras 00521 - 7054  taken in 2006 , in which we detect an ultra strong and broad  line . in ",
    "2 we describe the xmm observations and data reduction .",
    " 3 provides our detailed spectral fitting to the continuum and the emission line , followed by discussion in  4 .",
    "iras 00521 - 7054  was observed with xmm - newton twice in 2006 in prime full window mode .",
    "the durations of the two exposures were 17.3 ks ( on march 22 , 2006 ) and 14.2 ks ( april 22 , 2006 ) respectively .",
    "we reduced the raw data with the xmm - newton scientific analysis system ( sas ) @xcite version 10.0.0 .",
    "the exposures were processed using the sas pipeline  epchain \" and  emchian \" . we filtered the event files to include only those events with xmm - sas quality flag flag==0 ( @xmath21xmmea_em ) for pn ( mos1 and mos2 ) , and extracted single- and double - pixel events ( pattern @xmath22 4 ) for pn , and single- to quadruple - pixel events ( pattern @xmath22 12 ) for mos1 and mos2 . after excluding high background intervals , the net exposures for two observations are 5.7 ks and 7.9 ks for pn , and 7.4 ks and 11.0 ks for mos respectively .",
    "source spectra were extracted from circles with radius of 30  for pn ( to avoid nearby chip edge ) and 40  for mos centered on the source position . for both pn and mos data ,",
    "the background events were extracted from source - free areas on the same chip using four circular circles with a combined area 4 times larger than the source region .",
    "we note that adopting different background regions would not alter any scientific results presented in this work .",
    "the response matrix and ancillary response file were generated using the rmfgen and arfgen tools with the sas software .",
    "the extracted net source count rate is @xmath23 0.26 cts / s for pn , and @xmath23 0.08 cts / s for mos , thus the exposures are free from pile - up effect .",
    "we examined the light curves of each exposure , and found no significant variation within or between two exposures . through a preliminary spectral fitting , we also found no spectral variations between two observations .",
    "we therefore combined the spectra from two exposures to increase the s / n ratio in the spectra , and obtained one composite pn spectrum and one mos spectrum ( co - added from mos1 and mos2 ) .",
    "both spectra were binned to have at least 20 counts per bin to allow the use of @xmath12 statistics with xspec v12.6.0 .",
    "all fitting errors are of @xmath24 confidence level for one parameter ( @xmath25 ) , if not otherwise stated .",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . during spectral fitting ,",
    "the galactic column density along the line of sight to iras 00521 - 7054 is always taken into account ( @xmath29 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure 1 we present xmm spectra of iras 00521 - 7054   for both pn and the summed mos1 and mos2 data .",
    "it can be seen that the mos data are consistent with the pn data within the statistical errors .",
    "we first fit the 0.5  10 kev spectra with an absorbed powerlaw plus an extra soft component .",
    "the soft component could be scattered emission of the intrinsic x - ray continuum , or from the host galaxy .",
    "we find that either a powerlaw free from intrinsic absorption ( with @xmath3 = 2.4@xmath30 ) , a blackbody ( with t = 0.21@xmath310.03 kev ) or a bremss plasma emission could provide adequate fit to the soft component , and these models are statistically indistinguishable based on current data .",
    "hereafter , we simply choose a blackbody model to fit the soft component .",
    "we note that choosing different soft component models would not alter the fitting results in this work .",
    "this simple continuum model provides a poor fit to the data , with @xmath32368.3 for 287 degrees of freedom .",
    "the data to model ratio plot ( figure 1b ) shows that there is clear residual emission between 3  7 kev that could be interpreted as the existence of a relativistic  emission line .",
    "we then exclude data bins between 3  7 kev to fit the continuum , and present the plot of data to best - fit model ratio in fig .",
    "1 ( panel c ) to demonstrate the line profile .    the line appears rather broad , and the red wing extends to as low as 3 kev .",
    "we then add a relativistic disk line model ( @xmath33 in xspec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit the broad line ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the fitting is significantly improved ( @xmath34@xmath12 = 58 for 4 more free parameters ) .",
    "the best - fit line and continuum parameters are listed in table 1 . during the fit , we fixed the line energy at 6.4 kev in the source rest frame ,",
    "since it is otherwise poorly constrained by the data . the small best - fit inner radius ( r@xmath35 = 1.8@xmath36 r@xmath37 ) suggests that the central smbh is fast rotating ( fitting with a @xmath38 model for a non - rotating smbh instead yields larger @xmath12 , @xmath39 = 9 ) .",
    "furthermore , the line ew is remarkably large ( ew = 1.3@xmath40 kev in the rest frame ) .",
    "the best - fit inclination of the disk is 37@xmath41 . since narrow  cores are often seen in the x - ray spectra of agns ( yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; shu et al . 2010b , 2011 )",
    ", we added a narrow gaussian line ( with central energy fixed at 6.4 kev in the rest frame , and line width at zero , i.e. , unresolved by xmm pn and mos spectra ) to the fit , and found such a narrow component is statistically not required in additional to the broad component ( @xmath34@xmath12 @xmath42 1 , ew @xmath42 56.0 ev ) .",
    "reflection component from neutral material in additional to the underlying powerlaw ( @xmath43 in xspec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is statistically not required either ( @xmath34@xmath12 = 0 , r @xmath42 0.8 ) , the normalization of which thus has little effect on the broad fe ka line intensity .",
    "we also apply a self - consistent model ( @xmath44 @xmath15 @xmath45 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit the broad line ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and the best - fit parameters are presented in table 1 .",
    "the fitting also suggests that the central smbh is rotating , with @xmath19 = 0.97@xmath46 .",
    "this model produces similar residual @xmath12/dof comparing with the simple @xmath33 line model ( 310.13/283 vs 311.54/280 ) , and consistent physical parameters , including inclination angle @xmath47 , inner radius and emissivity index @xmath48 .",
    "we present the detection of an ultra strong and broad  line in seyfert 2 galaxy iras 00521 - 7054 .",
    "the x - ray continuum is fitted with a powerlaw plus a soft blackbody emission .",
    "the observed 0.5  2 kev and 2  10 kev fluxes are 3.8 @xmath49 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath50 and 2.4 @xmath51 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath50 respectively .",
    "absorption corrected 2  10 kev rest frame luminosity is 3.9 @xmath52 ergs s@xmath50 .",
    "the  line is rather strong with ew = 1.3@xmath40 kev , larger than most broad  lines detected in other agns ( with typical ew of several 100 ev ) .",
    "spectral fitting suggests that the smbh in iras 00521 - 7054  in rotating with a spin of @xmath19 = 0.97@xmath46 .",
    "this is the first measurement of smbh spin in a type 2 agn .      in this sub - section",
    "we investigate whether such an ultra strong and broad  line could be in fact due to curvature in underlying continuum caused by more complex absorption .",
    "below we applied different absorption models to the spectra without including an additional broad emission line component .",
    "single warm absorber ( @xmath53 in xspec ) , a partially covering warm absorber , or a partial covering cold absorber model can be easily ruled out because of the much larger @xmath12 reduced ( @xmath39 @xmath54 50 , comparing with the @xmath33 line model ) .",
    "we then adopted a dual cold absorber model ( with n@xmath13 covering 100% of the central x - ray source , and n@xmath17 partially covering the continuum ) .",
    "interestingly , the dual - absorber model fits the spectra much better ( @xmath12/dof = 319.09@xmath55285 ) , however it is still statistically worse than the @xmath33 line model ( @xmath39 = 9 ) . in figure 3(b ) , we can still see clear residuals at @xmath23 6 kev in the data to model ratio plot , comparing with the the residuals of best - fit @xmath33 and @xmath45 model ( see fig .",
    "3d and 3e ) . adding a reflection component ( @xmath43 ) and/or a narrow gaussian at 6.4 kev to the dual - absorber model",
    "does not change the produced @xmath12 . replacing either one or both of the cold absorbers with ionized absorption yields consistent results and best - fit ionization parameters at zero , indicating more complex warm absorption models",
    "do not improve the fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the dual - absorber model are n@xmath13 = 7.0@xmath14 @xmath7 @xmath8 with unit coverage , and n@xmath17 = 21.7@xmath56 @xmath7 @xmath8 with a covering factor @xmath57 = 0.71@xmath58 .",
    "we also note that the best - fit powerlaw slope ( @xmath3 = 2.8@xmath59 ) appears considerably steep , greater than that of 99.7% of agns in a large xmm sample @xcite .",
    "we note that in our dual absorber model , all element abundances are fixed to the solar values . by adopting the @xmath60 model in xspec",
    ", we tried to fit the spectra by allowing the fe and ni abundance to be free parameters , which could likely produce better fit to the strong edge feature at @xmath23 7 kev in the spectra .",
    "we found that an overabundance of fe / ni ( by a factor of @xmath23 2.6 ) could slightly improves the fit ( @xmath61 ) , but is statistically not required , thus the abundance of fe / ni can not be well constrained .",
    "this model however yields a flatter powerlaw index ( @xmath62 ) , consistent with most agns .",
    "figure 3c shows the data to model ratio plot for this model , in which weak residuals at @xmath23 6 kev is still visible , comparing with the @xmath33 and @xmath45 model .",
    "this model ( by allowing the fe and ni abundance to be free parameters ) is still statistically slightly worse than the laor line model ( the difference of @xmath12 is 6.5 with the same degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that , while the relativistic reflection scenario yields formally a slightly better fit than the double absorption scenario we have presented in this paper , only follow - up observations with higher spectral resolution and/or larger sensitive energy bandpass would allow us to discriminate between them .",
    "spectral fitting to the broad  line suggests that the accretion system is viewed at an intermediate inclination angle of 37@xmath10@xmath11 , in agreement with studies of other type 2 agns @xcite .",
    "it s interesting to note that @xcite reported the detection of broad h@xmath19 emission line ( with full width at zero intensity of @xmath54 6000 km / s ) in its optical spectrum .",
    "this suggests that iras 00521 - 7054  is a seyfert 1.9 galaxy , consistent with the intermediate inclination angle obtained through x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "the measured broad line shows superb large line ew ( 1.3@xmath40 kev in the rest frame , fitted with a @xmath33 line ) , much larger than most of those previously detected in either type 1 or type 2 agns .",
    "this is however a different situation comparing with large narrow  line ew ( @xmath54 1 kev ) reported in compton - thick agns ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in compton - thick agns ,",
    "the large  line ew is due to the strong attenuation to the underlying continuum , and the narrow  line , which is produced at a much larger scale comparing with the continuum , suffers no or little obscuration . in iras",
    "00521 - 7054 , there exists only moderate obscuration to the continuum .",
    "furthermore , the detected  line is ultra broad , and is believed from the innermost region of the accretion disk , thus strong attenuation ( if there is any ) could not enlarge the line ew .",
    "theoretical calculations have shown that reflection from a constant density slab which is illuminated with a powerlaw spectrum could produce  line with ew no larger than @xmath23 800 ev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one possible explanation to the observed large ew in iras 00521 - 7054  is light bending effect .",
    "@xcite reported a similar large line ew ( 1.4 kev if fitted with a @xmath33 line ) in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 during a low - flux interval , and it can be simply attributed to the strong light bending effect which could ( with the x - ray continuum source located closer to the central smbh ) yield weaker observed flux in continuum , but almost constant reflection component .",
    "we note that the fitted emissivity index @xmath48 ( see table 1 ) is also consistent with that reported in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 during a low - flux interval ( 3.3@xmath310.3 ) .",
    "however , it is still puzzling that the line ew in iras 00521 - 7054  remains stably large during two xmm exposures , while such large ew was rather rare in other agns and was only detected in low flux state in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , and in 1h0707 - 495 @xcite and iras13224 - 3809 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 model also yields an over abundance of iron ( fe / solar = 3.4@xmath311.3 ) .",
    "we note that similar over abundance in iron was also reported in other agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fit spin of the smbh is @xmath63 ( 90% confidence level ) , suggesting that the black hole may be maximally spinning .",
    "however , a schwarzschild solution is still consistent with the data if the 99% confidence level uncertainties are considered ( see figure 4 ) . higher s / n spectra",
    "are therefore desired to understand the nature of the ultra strong and broad  line in iras 00521 - 7054 .",
