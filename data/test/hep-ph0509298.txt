    "predicted value amounts to sensitive tests of the mssm and allows the indirect determination of further mssm parameters .",
    "it is therefore important to know @xmath4 as a function of the mssm parameters as precisely as possible .",
    "a lot of effort has been put into the evaluation of @xmath4 ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "so far , the one - loop contributions are completely known .",
    "the most important two - loop corrections are the ones enhanced by the yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quark @xmath9 .",
    "the yukawa - enhanced contributions of @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13 , @xmath14  @xcite are known in the on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "all these yukawa - enhanced contributions can be evaluated in the gauge - less limit , where the electroweak gauge couplings and @xmath15 go to zero with fixed ratio @xmath16 and fixed higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "further electroweak two - loop contributions that go beyond the gauge - less limit are known in the @xmath17 scheme @xcite .",
    "the remaining intrinsic error of the yukawa - enhanced corrections has been estimated to @xmath18  gev @xcite .",
    "there might be , however , an additional yukawa - enhanced contribution from non - supersymmetric counterterms at the two - loop level .",
    "so far , such terms have been assumed to vanish , but without an explicit investigation .",
    "in this paper we close this gap by a detailed evaluation of the counterterm structure at two - loop order .    in all the references listed above , regularization by dimensional reduction ( dred )  @xcite has been employed and it has been assumed that all symmetries of the mssm are preserved by this method . according to this assumption , the structure of the counterterms is symmetric and generated by multiplicative renormalization . however , although dimensional reduction has been checked to preserve supersymmetry in many individual cases , there is no general proof .",
    "the traditional checks apply to one - loop self energies @xcite , one - loop on - shell @xcite and off - shell @xcite three - point functions and further one - loop relations involving soft and spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "further checks concern the renormalization group @xmath19 functions at the two - loop level @xcite , corresponding to divergences of two - loop diagrams .",
    "most recently , supersymmetry identities for one - loop four - point functions and two - loop two - point functions ( without spontaneous symmetry breaking ) have been checked @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "dimensional reduction was in agreement with the required supersymmetry relations .",
    "these checks are indeed sufficient to prove that multiplicative renormalization is correct for the one - loop counterterms of the higgs , quark and squark sectors entering the two - loop calculation of @xmath4 at the level of one - loop subrenormalization .",
    "these results , however , do not constitute a proof that dimensional reduction preserves supersymmetry at the two - loop level .",
    "in particular , they can not exclude that supersymmetry is broken by a finite amount , which could be relevant for precision calculations of @xmath4 .    in the case of supersymmetry - breaking by the method of regularization , extra symmetry - restoring counterterms have to be added as discussed e.g.  in refs.@xcite .",
    "these extra counterterms , which are by themselves not supersymmetric , are required to restore the original symmetry at the quantum level at the considered order .",
    "they are finite since all divergences are cancelled by symmetric counterterms derived from multiplicative renormalization . if needed , they would cause a finite shift in the higgs - boson self - energies and thus would be relevant for precision calculations of @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore important to clarify the necessity for such counterterms .",
    "in particular , if the symmetry is broken , the two - loop counterterms for the higgs - potential have to be modified according to @xmath20 which contains the usual multiplicative symmetric counterterms @xmath21 and additional supersymmetry - restoring counterterms @xmath22 . the renormalizability of the mssm @xcite guarantees that supersymmetry can be restored by a suitable choice of @xmath22 .",
    "but since the structure of these extra counterterms does not correspond to multiplicative renormalization , they have to be derived from the supersymmetric slavnov - taylor identities explicitly evaluated at the two - loop level .",
    "in the present paper we derive the relevant supersymmetric two - loop slavnov - taylor identities that are potentially affected by @xmath23 and determine the values of the supersymmetry - restoring counterterms by a direct calculation .",
    "since we are aiming at contributions from the large yukawa couplings , we restrict ourselves to the gauge - less limit with respect to the electroweak interaction , i.e.  we take into account electroweak yukawa interactions and the strong interaction in terms of supersymmetric qcd .",
    "our explicit determination makes use of recent developments concerning dimensional reduction @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for complementary recent work ) . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that a slight reformulation of dimensional reduction , which does not affect its application to the calculation of @xmath4 , avoids the mathematical inconsistency of ref.@xcite .",
    "based on this reformulation , a dramatic simplification for evaluating supersymmetric slavnov - taylor identities has been obtained .",
    "the evaluation of such identities constitutes the central part of our calculation of @xmath22 .",
    "the general strategy of our calculation follows the approach described in refs .",
    "first we discuss general properties of the potential supersymmetry - restoring counterterms that are relevant for the calculation of the higgs - boson mass .",
    "then we derive suitable slavnov - taylor identities that are sensitive to these counterterms .",
    "finally , the slavnov - taylor identities are evaluated using the method of ref .",
    "the two - loop evaluation of the higgs - boson mass spectrum requires three types of counterterms : one - loop counterterms that renormalize divergent one - loop subdiagrams , products of one - loop counterterms that partially renormalize two - loop diagrams , and genuine two - loop counterterms . as mentioned in the introduction , multiplicative renormalization is sufficient for the one - loop counterterms . here",
    "we examine whether this applies also to the genuine two - loop counterterms .",
    "the genuine two - loop counterterms relevant for the evaluation of the higgs - boson self - energies correspond to the mssm higgs potential @xmath24 . at tree level , @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    in terms of the higgs doublets @xmath26 , @xmath27 , their respective vacuum expectation values @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 gauge couplings @xmath31 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath32 are combinations of soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters and the @xmath33-parameter , and @xmath34 is a soft supersymmetry - breaking parameter .",
    "the symmetric counterterms used in the literature are generated by the multiplicative renormalization transformation    @xmath35    where the notation @xmath36 refers to a renormalization constant of @xmath37-loop order .",
    "thus , the genuine two - loop symmetric counterterms have the structure @xmath38 v , \\label{dvmult}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is sufficient only if dred preserves supersymmetry at the two - loop level in the gauge - less limit .",

    ", @xmath22 contains quadratic and quartic terms , @xmath40 two simple properties of @xmath23 can immediately be derived .",
    "first , @xmath23 respects global @xmath41 gauge invariance .",
    "the reason is that dred .",
    "] preserves global gauge invariance as can easily be obtained e.g.  from the gauge invariance of the regularized lagrangian using the quantum action principle  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath22 depends on the higgs doublets @xmath42 and @xmath28 only via the combinations @xmath43 , similar to @xmath24 itself .",
    "second , the quadratic terms in @xmath44 are not necessary since the quadratic terms in the higgs potential ( [ vquad ] ) are not restricted by supersymmetry in the first place , and no supersymmetry - breaking could modify their structure .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath45",
    "any non - zero counterterm quartic in @xmath46 modifies both the higgs - boson four - point and two - point vertex functions and can thus contribute to the higgs - boson mass prediction .",
    "for example , the term @xmath47 and to the two - point functions involving @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , owing to ( [ dvquad ] ) , vanishing non - supersymmetric quartic counterterms would imply also the absence of non - supersymmetric counterterms for the self - energies .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to evaluate the quartic non - supersymmetric counterterms @xmath49 by considering their contribution to four - point functions .",
    "the starting point for the evaluation is the basic requirement that _ after _",
