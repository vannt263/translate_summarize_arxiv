    "in this paper , we propose a linear threshold agent - based model ( abm ) for the spread of political revolutions on social networks in dictatorial regimes . in our abm , nodes of the network can be in two states : active , i.e. , participating in the revolution , or inactive .",
    "transitions from the inactive to the active state are governed by a growth process that uses a traditional linear threshold mechanism : an individual @xmath1 may change from the inactive to the active state if the fraction of neighbours in the active state exceeds the linear threshold @xmath2 .",
    "linear threshold models have been studied before in the context of influence maximization @xcite , enforcement of unpopular norms @xcite , and general `` complex contagion '' processes @xcite .",
    "the development and analysis of linear threshold processes has been highly influenced by more established epidemiology @xcite and rumour spreading @xcite models , with one key difference : whereas a contact with a single `` infected '' individual is enough to spread a contagion in most epidemiology or rumour spreading applications , i.e. in `` simple contagion '' processes , multiple contacts with infected individuals are generally necessary to spread a contagion in a linear threshold process .",
    "indeed , epidemiological and rumour spreading models can be considered to be a special case of linear threshold models where the threshold parameter is chosen sufficiently small such that one infected neighbour enables propagation .",
    "most of the linear threshold models that have been studied in the context of social spreading or contagion processes @xcite consider evolution in discrete time .",
    "in contrast , our abm is chosen to evolve in continuous time since that facilitates the comparison of the abm with simplified population - level models , which is a major goal of this paper .",
    "the main justification for our linear threshold modelling approach in the context of political revolutions is that the decision to join a political revolution can be assumed to be a collective action problem @xcite : if individuals act unilaterally they are subject to retaliation by the regime , whereas if they act collectively then the regime loses the ability to punish due to a lack of resources .",
    "the linear threshold modelling approach is consistent with the collective action principle , since an individual transitions from an inactive to an active state only after the number of neighbours in the active state has been observed to reach the critical fraction @xmath2 , and the individual deems the revolution of sufficient size to consider participation . in order to incorporate communication network structure explicitly",
    ", we represent interactions between individuals @xmath1 by edges @xmath3 in an undirected graph @xmath4 .",
    "this contrasts with previous attempts to model political revolutions using linear threshold models that assume homogeneous mixing @xcite , i.e. that assume that @xmath4 is the complete graph .",
    "the goals and contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "we start by presenting the linear threshold abm for the spread of political revolutions on social networks , and then derive a hierarchy of simplified ordinary differential - equation ( ode ) models of varying degree of sophistication that characterize the solutions of the linear threshold abm , see table  [ tab : hierarchy ] .",
    "although the linear threshold abm allows us to explicitly model the effects of the communication network on the dynamics of the political revolution it models , the inherent complexity of modelling the state of all individuals simultaneously makes this approach difficult to analyze and expensive to simulate . for these reasons there is significant interest in simplified aggregate or population - level dynamical models , which can provide more cost - effective dynamical simulations , and can give insight in the qualitative dynamics of the abm and its parameter regimes , through dynamical analysis of the simplified model .",
    "it is a significant challenge to incorporate actual network structure in the ode models , and this is often important since details of the network structure may determine the qualitative behaviour of abm solutions as the abm parameters are changed . in this paper , we present two new effective ways to incorporate network structure into the one - compartmental ode that approximates the dynamical evolution of the expected fraction of the population that participates in the revolution in the linear threshold abm model .",
    "these approaches make use of the degree distribution of the graph or samplings of the network , and we call the resulting population - level ode models the _ binomial visibility function _ ( bvf ) and the _ empirical visibility function _ ( evf ) models . the evf model is significantly less expensive than the bvf , but we demonstrate its equivalence with the bvf in the limit of large network and sample size .",
    "extensive numerical tests show that these ode models perform remarkably well to predict qualitative behaviour of the abm ; in fact , they often perform as well as or better than a previously specified higher - order model that has many compartments and is much more expensive computationally @xcite , and that we refer to as the _ degree approximation _ ( da ) model .",

    "it is interesting to consider how the physical contact and facebook networks differ on some common network measures , see table [ tab : sum_stats ] . comparing the physical contact and facebook",
    "social networks along these admittedly limited measures nevertheless highlights substantial structural differences between these networks .",
    "the physical contact network appears more homogeneous than the facebook social network , in the sense that the facebook social network can be visually grouped into distinct communities , whereas the physical contact network can not ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] ) .",
    "the network measures presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : deg_distn]-[fig : clust_coeff ] and table  [ tab : sum_stats ] are generally supportive of this observation . for example , the cumulative degree distributions displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg_distn ] show that the physical contact network has an approximately normal distribution with a relatively small standard deviation , and hence , a thin tail .",
    "in contrast , the facebook social network has a much broader distribution ( possibly scale - free or exponential , although this can not be determined conclusively with such a small network size ) with a relatively large standard deviation , and hence , a fat tail .",
    "similarly , it is known that online social networks often have larger clustering coefficients than offline social networks . in section [ sec : interp ] we use the facebook and physical contact networks as representatives of online and offline social networks , respectively , to investigate differences in propagation properties that may arise between online and offline social networks within the linear threshold propagation model .",
    "consider a population of individuals who are represented by nodes @xmath5 , and whose interactions are represented by edges @xmath6 , of the graph @xmath4 with degree distribution @xmath7 .",
    "an individual @xmath8 at time @xmath9 can be in one of two states , i.e. @xmath10 ( _ inactive _ in the revolution ) or @xmath11 ( _ active _ in the revolution ) .",
    "we assume that the network @xmath12 is static so that the dynamics of the abm can be fully specified by providing rules for the transition of individuals from an inactive state to an active state and vice versa , together with parameter values and an initial condition . for the moment , we set aside the issue of the choice of parameters and initial conditions and restrict the remainder of this section to the specification and justification of the transition rules .      to specify the growth process of the abm , we use the standard linear threshold model that has been used before in the context of social spreading or contagion processes such as opinion formation , technology adoption , marketing , rioting , and political movements @xcite . as mentioned in section [",
    "sec : intro ] , the choice of individuals to join a revolution is a collective action problem @xcite : individuals are averse to unilateral action against the regime for fear of severe retaliation , but are willing to take action collectively in the belief that the regime will lack sufficient resources to punish the entire collective .",
    "thus , an individual @xmath8 will decide to join the revolution if he or she believes that it has grown sufficiently large to reduce the risk of retaliation from the regime to an acceptable level .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to assume that individuals will decide to join the revolution only after a large enough fraction of their neighbours in the social network have done so .",
    "this behaviour is captured by the following transition rule : if individual @xmath8 has @xmath15 neighbours @xmath16 , if @xmath10 , and if @xmath17 i.e. , if @xmath1 is inactive at time @xmath9 and has at least a fraction @xmath18 of its neighbours that are active , then node @xmath1 transitions from state 0 to state 1 at time @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the first arrival time of a poisson process with rate @xmath21 .",
    "we say that nodes that satisfy equation   can `` see '' the revolution , i.e. the revolution is visible to them .",
    "alternatively , we say that these nodes are `` considering joining the revolution '' .",
    "parameter @xmath21 determines the timescale of the growth process .",
    "while most of the linear threshold models that have been studied in the context of social spreading or contagion processes @xcite consider evolution in discrete time by choosing @xmath22 constant , we have specified @xmath22 so that equation   evolves in continuous time .",
    "specifying @xmath22 in this way is often considered in biology and epidemiology @xcite , since it ( a ) facilitates the comparison of the abm with population - level models ( as the svf model described in section [ sec : consist_abm_svf ] ) , and ( b ) eliminates the problem of choosing a suitable time - step for iterating the discrete - time process .",
    "furthermore , we note that by choosing @xmath22 to be the first arrival time of a poisson process , we are assuming that the decision making process is a markov , or memoryless , process .",
    "specifically , conditioned on the state of the system at time @xmath9 , we assume that the likelihood of an individual joining the revolution in the time interval @xmath23 $ ] is independent of the state of the system at any time @xmath24 . in words , the future is independent of the past , given the present .",
    "we assume that once an individual @xmath8 has become active the regime will attempt to arrest or disperse him or her , thus returning @xmath1 to an inactive state . as in the previous section",
    ", we assume that this is a memoryless process .",
    "we further assume that the regime can only arrest or disperse protesters so long as the total fraction of active protesters remains less than the regime s finite police capacity @xmath25 .",
    "the transition rule can then be characterized by the following : if @xmath26 and @xmath27 i.e. , if @xmath1 is active at time @xmath9 and the fraction of active individuals is less than the regime s police capacity @xmath28 , then the node @xmath1 transitions from state 1 to state 0 at time @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the first arrival time of a poisson process with rate @xmath31 , which determines the timescale of the decay process .",
    "this fully specifies the evolution of the abm , which we simulate using gillespie s algorithm , see appendix [ sec : gillespie ] .",
    "0.48 , @xmath28 , @xmath21 , and @xmath31.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.48 , @xmath28 , @xmath21 , and @xmath31.,title=\"fig : \" ]    before deriving a population - level ode for the linear threshold abm and establishing the consistency of the svf model from @xcite with the abm in the following section , it is useful to first review some basic properties of the svf model .",
    "for example , we will show later that the parameter regimes of the svf are predictive of the parameter regime transitions in the abm .",
    "the svf model is given by the equation @xmath32 with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the growth and decay of the fraction of protesters @xmath35 are modelled by the _ growth _ and _ decay _ functions @xmath36\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^+$ ] , respectively .",
    "given their roles in determining the rate of growth and decay , the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath31 are called the _ protesters enthusiasm _ and _ police efficiency _ parameters in @xcite . the growth and decay in the number of protesters are modulated by the _ visibility _ and _ policing _ terms that are taken to be step functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the indicator function is defined as @xmath39 these functions are parametrized by _ visibility _ and _ police capacity _",
    "parameters @xmath40 and @xmath28 , respectively . in words ,",
    "the fraction of protesters can grow only when the protest movement is sufficiently large to be `` visible '' to the general population , i.e. when protests are large enough that their existence can not be masked by the regime through censorship .",
    "conversely , the fraction of protesters can decay only so long as the fraction of protesters is less than the regime s finite capacity to disperse or arrest protesters .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that individuals who consider joining the revolution are faced with a collective action problem @xcite : if they choose to act unilaterally then they face severe retaliation from the regime , so they wait to act until the revolution becomes visible and if they act collectively then the regime loses the ability to punish due to a lack of resources .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath28 , @xmath21 , and @xmath31 , the dynamics of the svf fall into one of four main regimes , see fig .",

    "different parameter regimes are distinguished by the behaviour of equation   when @xmath43 lies between @xmath44 and @xmath28 .",
    "region ii ( @xmath45 ) is characterized by an interval of stable equilibria @xmath46 bounded by two unstable equilibria @xmath47 . since parameters in region",
    "ii are characterized by a relatively weak regime ( low @xmath28 ) and relatively small visibility ( low @xmath40 ) , region ii is interpreted in @xcite as the _ failed state _ parameter region .",
    "in contrast , regions iii0 , iiie , and iii1 ( @xmath48 ) are characterized by a relatively strong regime ( large @xmath28 ) and relatively large visibility ( large @xmath40 ) and differ in the value of the quantity @xmath49 , i.e. in the ratio of protester s enthusiam to the sum of protester s enthusiasm and police efficiency . in region iii0 ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath50 , the interval @xmath51 lies in the basin of attraction of the equilibrium of total state control @xmath41 .",
    "analogously , in region iii1 ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath52 , the interval @xmath51 lies in the basin of attraction of the equilibrium of the realized revolution @xmath42 .",
    "finally , in region iiie , i.e. when @xmath53 , the interval @xmath54 becomes the basin of attraction of a new equilibrium @xmath55 , which is called the _ equilibrium of civil unrest _ in @xcite .",
    "because of the contribution of the interval @xmath51 to the stability of the equilibrium of total state control , of the realized revolution , or of civil unrest , regions iii0 , iii1 , and iiie are called the _ stable police state _ , _ unstable police state _ , and _ meta - stable police state _ , respectively . for a full description , interpretation , and analysis of the svf model",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .        to show consistency of the abm proposed in section [ sec : spec_abm ] with the svf model of @xcite we begin by defining @xmath56 to be the fraction of nodes ( in the abm model ) that are expected to be in state 1 , i.e. the expected fraction of active nodes at time @xmath9 conditioned on information at time @xmath57 : @xmath58.\\ ] ] the fraction of nodes that are expected to be in state 0 ( inactive ) at time @xmath9 , conditioned on information at time @xmath57 , is then @xmath59 .",

    "next , let @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 denotes the neighbours of individual @xmath8 . in words , we let @xmath74 be the fraction of the total population at time @xmath57 that can see the revolution .",
    "we call @xmath74 the visibility function of the linear threshold abm . in the chosen notation for @xmath75",
    "it is emphasized that @xmath75 depends on @xmath67 , i.e. on the fraction of nodes that are active at time @xmath57 . at time @xmath76 , the pool of individuals that can go from inactive to active , i.e. that are considering joining the revolution , is therefore approximately @xmath77 . since inactive nodes that can see the revolution become active at the first arrival time of a poisson process with rate @xmath21 , we have @xmath78    combining equations - and dividing by @xmath79 gives @xmath80 taking the limit as @xmath81 yields @xmath82 this establishes a general population - level ode model that approximates the linear threshold abm , with visibility function @xmath83 .",
    "to close the model , the visibility function has to be specified , guided by equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) . observe that if we substitute @xmath83 by the step function @xmath84 , then this exactly recovers the svf model of @xcite , see equation  .",
    "so , provided that the step function @xmath85 is a suitable choice for @xmath86 , which we argued in the appendix of @xcite based on considering a simplified averaged threshold process that ignores correlations , this confirms the consistency of the abm and the svf . the crux of the argument used in @xcite , which we discuss further in sec .",
    "[ sec : bvf ] , is that , for real networks @xmath86 can be expected to be a steep sigmoidal function of @xmath43 , which can be approximated by a step function . in this paper , we test these assumptions explicitly on the empirical physical contact and facebook social networks discussed above using abm simulations , and we derive new improved ode models that form a more accurate representation of @xmath86 than a step function , taking into account the actual network structure of the empirical networks .",
    "the step function assumption was chosen in @xcite because it is useful when little information is known about the underlying network structure .",
    "for example , without having to specify an underlying communication network , the svf model provides a potential mechanism by which networks with increased visibility @xmath40 are more susceptible to political revolution .",

    "the facebook and physical contact networks we consider as case studies , i.e. the online and offline proxy networks , provide initial support to the hypothesis that the adoption of online social media may facilitate the spread of political revolutions by effectively changing the connectivity structure of the population in a way that makes linear threshold spreading more effective .",
    "specifically , we find that for certain parameters the online proxy network is more susceptible to the linear threshold spreading process than the offline proxy network .",
    "moreover , we find that the different behaviour of these two networks is consistent with the basic reproduction number calculated for these two networks .",
    "in addition to studying the abm and its approximations on more and larger online and offline networks , much work remains to be done in the actual modelling of the political revolution process .",

    "since individuals with greater sample size , i.e. larger degree , can form more accurate estimates of the current participation in the revolution , they should be willing to join the revolution at a lower linear threshold @xmath2 than individuals who are more uncertain in their estimate of revolution size .",
    "we would therefore expect the linear threshold to vary from individual to individual as a function of their network degree . or",
    ", consider that one of the principal strengths of new media is the ability of individuals to search for both content and like - minded individuals .",
    "thus , we would expect that the underlying communication network should be changing on the same time scale as the revolution .",
    "finally , one might consider that the nodes that are predisposed to be active at the initial stages of a revolution , e.g. nodes that represent activists , may also have larger degree ( if , for example , they are charismatic and allowed to accrue followers ) or smaller degree ( if , for example , they are the specific target of regime censorship ) . there is significant value in the kind of parsimonious abm model on static networks that we have considered in this paper , because much can be learned from this type of model and it is easier to analyze and interpret than more complex models .",
