    "although the events are typically rare , they can appear much more frequently than for a gaussian distributed field  a manifestation of ( small - scale ) intermittency in turbulence @xcite . from a mathematical perspective , these high - amplitude events are solutions of the underlying dynamical equations which display a very rapid temporal variation with respect to a norm defined for the whole fluid volume @xcite",
    ". typical quantities which can be probed are the vorticity or ( local ) enstrophy @xcite , local strain @xcite or the magnitude of temperature , and passive scalar derivatives @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of extreme events in turbulence have been performed in cubes with periodic boundaries in all three space dimensions @xcite . with increasing reynolds number these extreme events in box turbulence",
    "are concentrated in ever finer filaments or layers @xcite .",
    "alternatively , extreme dissipation events can be connected to flow structures in wall - bounded flows that have a large spatial coherence and exist longer than the typical eddies or plumes .",
    "such dissipation events are observed for example in connection with ramp - cliff structures of the temperature @xcite , with superstructures of the velocity @xcite in atmospheric boundary layers , or with very - large scale motion in pipe flows @xcite .",

    "we demonstrate a direct dynamical link between a transition of the large - scale turbulent fields and the rare high - amplitude events of the spatial derivatives which are sampled at the smallest scales of the turbulent flow far away from the boundary layers .",
    "the system is a three - dimensional turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) flow in a closed cylindrical cell .",
    "we show how the formation of a rare high - amplitude dissipation rate event in the bulk of the convection cell can be traced back to a plume emission from the bottom plate coinciding with a strong fluctuation of the large - scale circulation which exists in closed turbulent flows @xcite . in the large - scale fluctuation event ,",
    "the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) roll is significantly weakened and re - oriented afterwards . in the absence of the large - scale ordering circulation ( which would sweep the plumes along with it ) , a collision between a hot upwelling and cold downwelling plume is triggered which generates strong local gradients .",
    "such extreme dissipation events are very rare in the bulk since most of the viscous and thermal dissipation is inside the boundary layers at the top and bottom plates .",
    "this has been shown in several direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of convection @xcite . in our five high - resolution spectral element simulations at different",

    "our detected rare event reveals a direct connection between a strong large - scale fluctuation of the velocity and a small - scale extreme dissipation ( i.e. velocity derivative ) event , thus bridging the whole cascade range of the turbulent flow .",

    "@xmath50 remains nearly unchanged and @xmath51 fluctuates more strongly , but there is no large event that stands out .",

    "this raises the last question , namely does a change in the large - scale dynamics enable such a rare plume collision event ?",
    "it is well - known that in closed convection cells a large - scale circulation ( lsc ) exists @xcite . in cells with @xmath93 ,",
    "the lsc consists of one big roll which forces the plumes to move along the top or bottom plate , and then to rise dominantly on one side of the cell and to fall down on the other side .",
    "this ordering influence stops when the large - scale circulation decelerates strongly and becomes re - oriented .",
    "such events have been studied statistically in experiments @xcite , numerically in two - dimensional @xcite or three - dimensional @xcite convection as well as in low - dimensional models @xcite .",

    "we define @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the complex three - dimensional structure of the up- and downwelling convective currents in the closed cell is thus reduced to a one - dimensional signal .",

    "we find @xmath101 in all sections of cell .",
    "this indicates that a one - roll circulation pattern dominates the lsc as is supported by the isocontours in figure [ fig6](d )",
    ". in figures [ fig6](a)(c ) , @xmath102 steadily decreases towards @xmath103 with @xmath77 being the time of the extreme dissipation event .",
    "the ratio of the fourier coefficients is changed to @xmath104 for the lower section of the cell ( see figure [ fig6](c ) ) , while in the mid and upper sections ( see figures [ fig6](a , b ) ) , @xmath105 is observed .",
    "the growth of the @xmath106 mode demonstrates that up- and downwelling convective currents are found now close to each other , in particular in the lower section of the cell , as can be seen by the isocontours in figure [ fig6](e ) .",
    "for @xmath107 , we observe a re - establishment of the one - roll pattern , as supported by figure [ fig6](f ) .",
    "the whole process proceeds within @xmath108 . also plotted in figures [ fig6](d)(f ) are the isocontours for large @xmath109 , which always are located near the bottom and top plates . however , in figure [ fig6]e , one sees a region of large @xmath109 in between the upwelling hot and downwelling cold plumes as they collide , consistent with the increase in @xmath109 in the bulk seen in figure [ fig1 ] .    .",

    "we have connected a far - tail , extreme dissipation event at the small scales in the bulk of a three - dimensional rayleigh - bnard convection flow in a closed cell to a reduction event in the lsc accompanied by a plume emission from the bottom boundary layer .",
    "such an event is very rare . in five different simulations spanning a range of @xmath23 and @xmath24 over long evolution times it was the only very high dissipation event in the bulk away from boundary layers as shown in figure [ fig1_app ] .",
    "the detection was possible by monitoring the well - resolved fourth - order dissipation moments in the bulk of the cell during the simulations .",
    "we also have showed how a transition of the large - scale flow structures in the cell can impact the dynamics at the smallest scales , the scales across which the steepest gradients are formed .",
    "the two events are thus directly linked and bridge the whole scale range of the turbulent cascade . the large - scale coherent fluid motion is established here due to the presence of walls which enclose the convection cell .",
    "it can be expected that it would be absent in box turbulence with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "how frequently does such a high - dissipation event appear ? if one takes a typical far - tail amplitude of the pdf of @xmath109 ( see lower left panel of figure [ fig2_app ] ) of @xmath119 and multiplies it with the binwidth @xmath120 , one gets an estimate of the probability of the appearance of a high - thermal - dissipation event in the bulk of @xmath121 , i.e. , one out of 2.5 billion data points .",
    "the bulk volume @xmath26 contains about a fifth of the total cell volume and about 10 per cent of the total number of mesh cells which translates to roughly 40 million cells for @xmath26 .",
    "that means that one picks such high - dissipation events every 60 to 70 @xmath22 if one continues with the same sampling frequency as in the original production run .",
    "our total integration time for run 1 was 104 @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , if one wants to have a complete picture of the small - scale statistics of a wall - bounded turbulent flow then these events have to be incorporated .",
    "as our estimate shows , this requires very long - time integrations of the fully resolved boussinesq equations which becomes increasingly expensive as the rayleigh number grows or the prandtl number decreases .",
