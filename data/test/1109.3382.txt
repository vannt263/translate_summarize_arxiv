    "the cms experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) announced  @xcite recently that , for standard model ( sm ) with four quark generations ( 4 g ) ,  the higgs boson in the mass range of 120 to 600 gev is excluded at the 95% c.l . \" .",
    "the atlas experiment is in agreement  @xcite .",
    "a common inference is that the 4 g itself is practically ruled out .",
    "afterall , cms also reported the most stringent bounds on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks to date : @xmath20 gev  @xcite and @xmath21 gev  @xcite , both at 95% c.l .",
    ", which are rather close to the unitarity bound ( ub ) of 500550 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , in as much as 4 g may not exist , an intriguing possibility  @xcite is that electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) itself might be triggered by , or related to , the strong yukawa couplings of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks .",
    "can the ub violation of strong @xmath22 scattering  @xcite be related to the ub violation of strong @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering ? to pursue such questions is a major purpose of the lhc , and is well within its abilities .",
    "if a relatively light higgs particle emerges soon at the lhc with sm cross sections , then 4 g would truly be in trouble  @xcite .",
    "but , the exclusion statement of sm/4 g higgs might well get extended to the sm higgs itself with 2011 - 2012 lhc data . for higgs particle beyond 600 gev or so",
    ", one enters the strong @xmath22 scattering domain , and the  higgs \" becomes a broad object  @xcite , which requires both high energy ( 14 tev ) and high luminosity to explore .",
    "for such a heavy higgs boson , if the @xmath2 or @xmath3 quarks were however found below 500550 gev or so , then the yukawa sector may not be strongly coupled enough to link with the strongly coupled  higgs sector \" .",
    "thus , we have in mind the scenario where neither the ( sm - like ) higgs boson , nor the 4 g quarks , are found below 600 gev and 500550 gev , respectively .",
    "it is important to remember that new @xmath25 violating phases associated with 4 g quarks may link to  @xcite the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "thus , the existence of a very heavy 4 g may touch both ewsb and bau , which are two of the greatest problems in particle physics .",
    "this provides strong motivation for continuing the pursuit of 4 g in this volatile time .",
    "if the higgs boson is heavy ( and  fat \" ) , while the 4 g quarks are above the ub , then whether the large yukawa coupling induces @xmath23 condensation  @xcite or not , it would be important to explore possible _ bound states _ of this strong coupling .",
    "this is not just about potentially interesting lhc phenomenology , but may be necessary to provide a guide for the search of ultraheavy chiral quarks beyond ub .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore lower lying bound states of strong yukawa coupling , and the associated properties .",
    "however , by venturing above the ub , one immediately encounters the perils of the breaking down of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , in lieu of genuine nonperturbative approaches , such as  @xcite lattice field theory ( lft ) , our work is only of an illustrative kind .",
    "one aid to the study is a new , heavy isospin .",
    "if 4 g quarks exist , by which we mean a sequential left - handed doublet and a pair of right - handed singlets under the weak interaction , the @xmath26 , @xmath27 variables  @xcite or electroweak precision tests ( ewprt ) require the @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be nearly degenerate ( and here , independently , a heavier higgs is also required  @xcite ) .",
    "of course , some small splitting is needed to satisfy @xmath27 , but in this paper we will treat the @xmath2 and @xmath3 as degenerate , hence one has a new  isospin \" .",
    "this isospin , in contrast to the chiral limit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks under qcd , is in the opposite limit of degenerate _",
    "we thus borrow the notation of isovector @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 $ ] ) and isoscalar @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) etc .",
    ", for the heavy @xmath36  mesons \" .",
    "as we will see , unlike technicolor , the  @xmath31 \" meson does not play a major role for yukawa bound states , nor does the @xmath33 .",
    "another interesting point is that , if the yukawa interaction is the dominant binding mechanism , since it is color blind , the @xmath36 mesons , unlike the qcd situation , come not only in color singlets , but color octets as well  @xcite .",
    "we find the states @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath39 , where the subscript indicates the color representation , to be of phenomenological interest .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 and @xmath10 may be accessible in the near future .    in sec .",
    "ii , we bring forth the issues of strongly coupled relativistic bound states .",
    "we contrast the necessarily relativistic @xmath40 coupling of weak nambu ",
    "goldstone boson ( ng ) , or longitudinal vector boson exchange , to the coulombic qcd bound state , as well as scalar exchange . because the higgs scalar should be treated as heavy now , its effect is less prominent than ng exchange .",
    "we compare the traditional relativistic expansion  @xcite with a relativistic bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite , and illustrate why the yukawa bound state involves highly relativistic motion of its constituents .",
    "an issue appears regarding the treatment of @xmath41-channel ng exchange , towards strong yukawa binding .",
    "this , plus other issues , forces us to compromise in the study of the possible spectrum at this stage , and we restrict ourselves to @xmath42 in the range of 500700 gev , i.e. not far above the ub .",
    "in this way , the relativistic expansion provides a partial guide , while we offer a peek beyond and consider binding energies of order @xmath43 gev or more , for the possible spectrum around and above the tev scale .",
    "this leads us to focus on , from the production point of view , an @xmath37 state ( effectively a ",
    "@xmath44 \" , or gluon - prime ) , as well as possibly the @xmath10 and @xmath38 states in its decay final state . in sec .",
    "iii we turn to exploring the production and decay properties .",
    "we survey the key parameters needed : the binding energy , the vector ",
    "pseudoscalar and octet  singlet mass splittings , the vector meson decay constant @xmath45 , and the quark mixing element @xmath13 .",
    "production is mostly through @xmath46 and depend only on @xmath45 , but the annihilation , transition , and free quark decays involve all these parameters , where the numerical values we use are only illustrative .",
    "we find , in general , that the @xmath37 is relatively narrow , but has a host of decay final states , which might therefore elude early detection .",
    "we offer some discussion of the phenomenology at lhc in sec .",
    "iv , touching briefly on _ deep _ bound states , i.e. the possibility of binding energy approaching @xmath42 itself , for @xmath42 beyond 700 gev .",
    "we end with a conclusion and outlook .",
    "when the unitarity bound is reached for very heavy chiral quarks , it means that some _ tree level _ @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering cross sections will violate unitarity , or conservation of probability , in the high energy limit .",
    "pointed out over 30 years ago  @xcite , it is remarkable that we are now at the doorsteps to probe whether such new heavy chiral quarks exist .",
    "many , if not most people , tacitly take the ub as a kind of ceiling for sm - like chiral quarks to make sense .",
    "but in reality , crossing the ub just implies that the yukawa couplings are becoming so strong , they are turning nonperturbative .",
    "we have seen how the remarkable theory of qcd turns nonperturbative in the infrared , resulting in the rich phenomena of hadrons .",
    "we will not dwell on deeper short - distance ( uv ) gauge theories like technicolor , but just take the large yukawa couplings  @xcite at face value : if chiral quarks @xmath47 ( a left - handed doublet of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our case ) exist at or above the ub , what could be the emergent phenomena ?",
    "consider first heavy quarkonia bound by qcd .",
    "since qcd is perturbative at short distance , we have the familiar coulombic bound states with a @xmath48 enhancement factor , where @xmath49 is the velocity .",
    "this is the domain of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , where one expands in velocity , which is of order @xmath50 .",
    "the nr nature makes good contact with the familiar atomic systems .",
    "exchanging higgs bosons brings in the yukawa couplings , which has been considered in the literature . for our case",
    ", we will treat the higgs boson as above  @xcite 600 gev and heavy , which suppresses the binding effect due to higgs exchange .",
    "however , ng or longitudinal vector boson exchange ( transverse gauge boson exchange has coupling constant @xmath51 or @xmath52 , hence subdominant and largely ignored by us ) also couples with the yukawa coupling strength , but it involves the @xmath40 , which couples the upper and lower components of the massive dirac quark . since the lower component vanishes when the heavy quark is at rest , ng exchange is suppressed in the nr limit .",
    "conversely , the coupling to high momentum heavy quarks is large , the more so the heavier the quark .",
    "this reflects the derivative coupling nature of longitudinal vector bosons .",
    "the upshot is that , yukawa interactions between very heavy quarks are large when these quarks are in relativistic relative motion , i.e. with momentum @xmath53 .    with this insight , and ignoring the higgs exchange for the moment , if the bound state formation is dominated by qcd , then the nr nature of the bound state ( @xmath54 ) actually suppresses the effect of yukawa coupling .",
    "however , as the yukawa coupling increases with @xmath42 , although the qcd - bound system becomes even more nonrelativistic , at some point ng exchange would ( perhaps suddenly ) take over , and one would find the bound state system turns ultrarelativistic .",
    "we shall illustrate with two different perspectives , one a traditional relativistic expansion  @xcite , the other a relativistic bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite .",
    "a standard approach in considering bound state phenomena is to make a relativistic expansion around the leading potential .",
    "the higgs potential for very heavy quarks , in the context of forming bound states , was considered a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections were recently calculated in ref .",
    "the scattering amplitudes for @xmath17-channel higgs , neutral and charged ng ( called fictitious scalar in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and gluon exchange , as well as @xmath41-channel ng exchange , were computed .",
    "@xcite , however , did not put in @xmath41-channel higgs and gluon exchange , even though both color singlet and octet @xmath23 configurations were discussed . touching both @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 cases ,",
    "a variational approach was used to estimate the size @xmath57 ( equivalent to wavefunction ) and binding energy for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , color singlet and octet states .",
    "we will not repeat what was already done here , but just give some salient features . as a control on validity of the relativistic ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) expansion , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite required @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the relative momentum ) , which translates into @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath17-channel gluon exchange gives the coulomb potential , it is clear that one has a coulombic qcd bound state when @xmath42 is not yet too large , with bohr radius @xmath65 .",
    "the low mass higgs case is no longer tenable with 4 g , both by direct search  @xcite , and indirectly  @xcite from ewprt due to the heaviness of 4 g quarks . for the heavy higgs case illustrated with @xmath56 , as one can see from fig .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the radii @xmath57 of the @xmath38 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( the subscript @xmath68 stands for color singlet ) states decrease rather slowly below @xmath65 as @xmath42 increases .",
    "the @xmath39 radius rises slowly above @xmath65 due to the extra repulsion it receives from @xmath41-channel ng exchange .",
    "the yukawa effect is subdominant compared with qcd , where inspection of the binding energies offer further support : they rise slowly from @xmath69 gev around @xmath70 gev , to @xmath71 gev at @xmath72 gev , with @xmath39 only slightly lower .",
    "however , just before @xmath42 reaches 400 gev , radius @xmath57 for @xmath38 drops precipitously , while the binding energy rises sharply from around @xmath73 gev , to around @xmath43 gev at @xmath74 gev . the condition @xmath64 is violated shortly above @xmath75 gev .    the  kink \"",
    "around 400 gev is the point where the ng exchange has wrestled the mechanism for binding away from the usual nr qcd binding .",
    "the sudden drop of the size of the bound state is due to tapping the large attraction at large momentum @xmath76 for the bound quark ( besides the @xmath40 coupling of the ng bosons , the heavy higgs also defines a very short range for the strong yukawa coupling to be effective ) .",
    "the resulting larger binding energy overcomes the much increased kinetic energy . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the onset is delayed until @xmath77 gev or so , with binding energy of @xmath78 gev at @xmath79 gev .    for color octet states , which are not bound by qcd , the binding energy for @xmath37 , due purely to yukawa coupling , turns on sharply around @xmath80 gev , rising to @xmath81 gev for @xmath79 gev .",
    "the @xmath82 state turns on much later , around @xmath83 gev .",
    "but , unlike @xmath39 , because there is no @xmath41-channel repulsion , @xmath10 is degenerate with @xmath37 .",
    "it should be noted that the yukawa effects of neutral and charged ng exchange is weaker but constructive for @xmath37 , while the converse is true for @xmath10 , so this degeneracy could be accidental .",
    "furthermore , this degeneracy should be lifted by @xmath41-channel gluon annihilation , which would raise @xmath84 but was not considered by the authors of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we shall soon see , the vector channel also has @xmath26- and @xmath85-wave mixing .    although identifying the @xmath38 as the lightest color singlet , and @xmath37 ( and @xmath10 ) as the lightest color octet , it is ironic that the relativistic expansion breaks down almost immediately after the strong yukawa binding becomes potent .",
    "but it does illustrate that one needs a genuine relativistic approach in treating strong yukawa binding .",
    "we turn to such an approach that is in principle nonperturbative , but carrying its own dubious features : the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation .",
    "a long time ago , around the time the ssc ( superconducting super collider ) was under construction but then unfortunately canceled , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pursued the bs equation approach to the relativistic bound states of very heavy sequential 4th generation quarks .",
    "it consists of a ladder sum of the scattering amplitudes that appear in the relativistic expansion . in the heavy isospin limit and treating @xmath86 , a clear isospin reorganization separates into @xmath87 and @xmath88  mesons \" .    for @xmath36 meson with total momentum @xmath89 and relative momentum @xmath76",
    ", one has a set of integral equations , with loop momentum @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the momentum exchange in @xmath17-channel",
    ". however , for @xmath41-channel annihilation contribution , the annihilation momentum is @xmath89 itself , and the integral over loop momentum @xmath90 carries no @xmath76 dependence , giving a possibly divergent constant . to remedy this , ref .",
    "@xcite took a fixed @xmath76 subtraction at @xmath92 . in this way , all the @xmath41-channel diagram contributions were eliminated from the bs equation .",
    "this includes even the @xmath41-channel gluon exchange for the octet , isosinglet vector channel , which was not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the authors concerned themselves with color singlet states only .    in terms of mathematical physics ,",
    "to set up integral equations to be solved in a self - consistent way , the subtraction at constant @xmath76 seems reasonable .",
    "however , as admitted by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite in a footnote , the @xmath41-channel ng exchange leads to repulsion .",
    "thus , in discussing bound state solutions , there is the issue of the physical correspondence , and therefore the range of validity ( in @xmath42 ) for implementing the subtraction . in the relativistic expansion ,",
    "one clearly would not drop the @xmath41-channel diagrams .",
    "our purpose here is not to make a full treatment of the bs equation , as it is only a ladder sum of @xmath17-channel exchange diagrams , with higher order corrections ignored .",
    "furthermore , while the bs equation is relativistic , its solution depends very much on the approximations and ansatz made . ref .",
    "@xcite illustrated with covariant gauge ( but employing a weak coupling relation between spatial and temporal spinor components ) , the instantaneous approximation with positive frequency potential only , as well as keeping both positive and negative frequency potentials .",
    "although the numerical solutions share common features , the bound state mass ( @xmath93 ) values differ . starting all from @xmath94 for low @xmath42 , they decrease smoothly as @xmath42 increases , without exhibiting the kink seen in the relativistic expansion . as such",
    ", the bs approach is an improvement .",
    "but , as a common feature , once the binding energy @xmath95 becomes significant ( e.g. @xmath43 gev or so ) , at high enough @xmath42 , the low lying mesons collapse .",
    "that is , the binding energy becomes so large such that the total mass drops to zero .",

    "quarkonium masses calculated at fixed order could also vanish at large enough coupling strength .",
    "the system has turned fully relativistic with strong coupling , and the familiar bohr - schrdinger solution is no longer valid . for the bs equation , however , it is already relativistic .",
    "the collapse of the meson state may be related to the symmetry breaking itself  @xcite , but because of the approximate nature of the bs equation , as well as the numerical approximations made in its solution , we refrain from dwelling further on this .",
    "rather , we wish to use the bs equation and its numerical study to compare and contrast with the previously discussed relativistic expansion , to project what may really happen for relativistic , strong yukawa bound states , before any  collapse \" , such as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , could occur .",
    "for this purpose , we note that with the _ subtracted _ bs equation , hence with the @xmath41-channel repulsion removed , the @xmath39 turns out to be the most attractive system , i.e. the lightest bound state : the ng , gluon and higgs exchange are all attractive , as can be seen also from ref .",
    "the behavior for @xmath38 is indeed similar , but the formalism is more complicated for the @xmath101 system , where the @xmath26- and @xmath85-wave channels are coupled .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite used ( sometimes tacitly ) a higgs mass around 100 gev , which is no longer valid . in our mind",
    ", we are interested in the bound state dominated by yukawa coupling , i.e. by ng exchange , hence we will view gluonic exchange as correction , with higgs exchange perhaps even milder .",
    "this matches to what one finds in the relativistic expansion , that the yukawa binding suddenly turns on , bringing on a rapid rise in binding energy . in effect",
    ", we use the bs equation approach to check , and probe beyond , the  kink \" seen in the relativistic expansion .",
    "the equation for @xmath39 is the most compact . in the impulse approximation , integrating over @xmath102 gives the amplitude @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the relative momentum . keeping both positive and negative frequency amplitudes @xmath105 ,",

    "the potentials @xmath108 , where we have absorbed a factor of @xmath109 into its definition as compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , arise from @xmath17-channel diagrams as described earlier .",
    "let us understand the @xmath110 and @xmath111 potentials .",

    "the potentials @xmath121 are symmetric in @xmath76 and @xmath90 , and is steepest along @xmath99 .",
    "we plot @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ vpm ] , for heavy @xmath98 gev , and for @xmath75 , 500 , 600 , 700 gev .",
    "we have checked that the @xmath123 potential drops by a factor of two or more as @xmath124 moves from 100 to 700 gev , but @xmath96 is rather insensitive to @xmath124 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ vpm ] that both the @xmath123 and @xmath96 potentials are suppressed for low relative momentum @xmath76 , agreeing with the relativistic expansion view .",
    "as @xmath76 increases , @xmath123 increases relatively slowly , reaching @xmath125 at @xmath126 ( 700 ) gev for @xmath74 ( 700 ) gev .",
    "but @xmath96 turns on more sharply , reaching beyond @xmath127 at @xmath128 gev , and @xmath129 at @xmath130 gev .",
    "so what does the strength of @xmath131 mean ?",
    "take the @xmath132 equation , the binding energy @xmath133 is equal to @xmath134 , the kinetic energy due to motion , plus the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bspi1 ] ) , which should be the  potential \" .",
    "let us normalize @xmath90 by @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath135 is steepest for @xmath99 , we see that @xmath136 for @xmath137 means the  potential \" is comparable to @xmath42 in strength when the momentum is comparable to the rest mass , and the kinetic energy due to motion is @xmath138 .",
    "we can now sense why there is a tendency for the @xmath39 state to collapse already for @xmath42 not far above 500 gev in the numerics of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have illustrated how the binding energy for the ( heavy ) isovector , color singlet @xmath140 state , which we call @xmath39 , could be already moving towards collapse for @xmath42 as low as 500 gev ( this number from ref .",
    "@xcite contains the attraction due to light higgs exchange ) , if the bs approach of eq .",
    "( [ bspi1 ] ) holds true .",
    "however , this state receives a repulsive @xmath41-channel ng annihilation contribution .",
    "furthermore , as the tendency towards collapse approaches , the ladder sum bs equation may no longer be sufficient . even within the bs approach , where eq .",
    "( [ bspi1 ] ) gives rise to the earliest collapse , if one drops the negative frequency amplitude , the collapse is delayed  @xcite by almost a factor of two in @xmath42 . in the covariant gauge but using a weak coupling relation between temporal and spatial spinor components ,",
    "the collapse of @xmath39 occurs slightly before the positive frequency only case .",
    "it is not clear at what @xmath42 the collapse truly occurs numerically . in any case",
    ", we would not touch the collapse here , as it is not yet well understood .",
    "it seems prudent , then , to consider binding energies of @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev , but not more , to make a preliminary study of possible phenomena at lhc , running at @xmath142 tev .    a similar equation as eq .",
    "( [ bspi1 ] ) holds for the isosinglet , color singlet @xmath140 state , the @xmath67 .",
    "although gluon and higgs exchange are attractive , ng exchange turns repulsive  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is much heavier than @xmath39 , and can not be a low - lying state .    turning to vector mesons , ref .",
    "@xcite found , similar to the relativistic expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the isoscalar @xmath38 has the tightest binding , though it is weaker than ( @xmath41-channel subtracted ) @xmath39 .",
    "this concurs with our earlier observation that yukawa effects are weaker but constructive for vector , while stronger but destructive for pseudoscalar . however , there is no repulsive @xmath41-channel effect for @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , checking the formalism , we find that there is @xmath143-@xmath144 mixing , resulting in a set of more complicated coupled bs equations . from the numerics of ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect that for @xmath42 in the range of 500700 gev , binding energies of order @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev is reasonable for @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath66 state , analogous to @xmath67 in receiving the repulsive ng exchange , is far less binding , which is also seen from the relativistic expansion .",
    "turning to color octet counterparts , one can treat gluon exchange as a perturbation when binding energies are much large than qcd bound states .",
    "given that the bound state should be rather small , the repulsion due to gluon exchange should be larger than typical qcd binding .",
    "but without fully solving for the bound state , octet - singlet splitting is uncertain .",
    "however , there should be no doubt that @xmath10 and @xmath37 would be the low - lying octet states , in agreement with the relativistic expansion .",
    "the octet @xmath145 and @xmath82 are likely not ( or at best weakly ) bound , hence we do not consider these .    to summarize , the states to keep in mind are @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath37 .",
    "there are possibly other states with different quantum numbers , but in general they would not be lighter , while likely possessing more complicated properties .",
    "the absence of @xmath31 states is distinct from qcd - like gauge theories such as technicolor . for @xmath42 in the range of 500 to 700 gev ,",
    "staying short of very tight binding , these states would probably populate the 1 to 1.4 tev range , with binding energies of order @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev .",
    "the ordering of the spectra , according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( which did not actually consider octet states ) , would be @xmath146 .    since we are concerned with lhc phenomenology and the heavy quark search program in the near future , we should consider briefly issues regarding production :    * @xmath39 and @xmath38 can not be produced via @xmath147 fusion , but can be produced via weak drell - yan processes , hence have a weak production cross section ; * @xmath10 can be pair produced by @xmath147 and @xmath7 scattering  @xcite , but it is heavier and less efficient at 7 tev .",
    "this leaves @xmath37 , which has the same quantum numbers as the gluon , that is the most attractive in the near future in terms of production cross section .",

    "both @xmath15 s tend to be transverse , but the hard @xmath15-jet and the gluon jet would form a rather narrow resonance !",
    "this case offers dramatic signature and should be quickly searched for .",
    "the production cross section , of course , is modulated by @xmath149 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pro ] ) .",
    "case 4 , which is the limiting case of small @xmath13 , has better likelihood than the even more special case 4@xmath321 discussed earlier",
    ".    leaving case 4 , i.e. if @xmath13 is closer to 0.1 , the next prominent decay compared with @xmath285 in general is  free \" quark decay , i.e. one of the bound @xmath2 or @xmath3 quarks decays , dissolving the bound state system . this could be practically the only other decay mode , if the exchange and annihilation decays are suppressed by a small decay constant ( case 2 ) .",
    "the signature is @xmath322 , @xmath323 ( plus c.c . ) , where the notation implies the associated @xmath324 or @xmath325 decays on - shell , but the @xmath210 and @xmath326 are decay products of a bound , somewhat off - shell @xmath2 or @xmath3 quark , which is not too different from open @xmath23 production .",
    "unless the on - shell nature is used in the direct search , the search limits would not be affected .",
    "however , once 4 g quarks are discovered , one should check whether , for some fraction of the events ( depending on resonance vs open @xmath23 production ratio ) , one of the heavy quarks is in fact off - shell , which would be an indication for bound state phenomena .",
    "we remark that open @xmath23 production at the lhc is dominantly through @xmath147 fusion , while the @xmath148 resonance production is through @xmath7 fusion .",
    "there is little resonance phenomena in @xmath327 via yukawa effects .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath328 channels , it is even repulsive",
    ". thus , even above the unitarity bound , standard search can continue , except that there may be some  anomalies \" as we have discussed , if any thing is found at all .",
    "we have already dealt with the special case of dijet resonance for case 4 .",
    "dijets from @xmath329 tend to be subdominant in all other cases ( i.e. 13 ) , but it could be at 10% level .",
    "it would provide a spectacular dijet resonance signal , and definite measurement  @xcite of resonance mass , and spin if there is good signal over background .",
    "if the branching ratio could be measured in some way , one could access the important decay constant .",
    "in general , a resonance would also appear in @xmath259 ( boosted top jets ) , with cross section 1/5 the dijet resonance .    finally , there is also the exchange decay to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which is a subdominant channel typically below 10% .",
    "it mimics  single @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) \" production , and can be studied that way .",
    "but an associated boosted top , or a high @xmath302 @xmath16-jet that tags a resonant @xmath326 , could be quite distinct .",
    "we offer some remarks on the @xmath330  @xcite and @xmath331  @xcite anomalies at the tevatron .",
    "naively , one might think that the presence of resonance production of @xmath259 could be relevant for @xmath330 .",
    "but @xmath148 has same quantum numbers as the gluon , i.e. the coupling to @xmath259 is fully vector .",
    "thus , it can not generate @xmath330 suggested by tevatron data . for the @xmath331 anomaly",
    ", the yukawa bound resonances are so massive , they can have nothing to do with it .",
    "this brings us to comparing with technicolor ( tc ) models .",
    "low scale tc has been invoked  @xcite for the @xmath331 anomaly suggested by cdf .",
    "our @xmath148 and @xmath221 are yukawa bound @xmath23 mesons with an operative heavy isospin , from degenerate chiral quark doublet @xmath47 not too far above the unitarity bound .",
    "thus , our @xmath148 and @xmath221 mesons are much heavier than those in low scale tc . for more generic tc models",
    "@xcite , since  walking \" is generally required , the technipion @xmath332 tends to be closer to the technirho @xmath333 in mass such that @xmath334 is absent , while ( near ) degeneracy of @xmath335 and @xmath336 with @xmath333 is also often invoked .",
    "the signature for these technimesons are typically @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "thus , not only the spectrum is rather different  absence of @xmath31 and @xmath340 mesons  the decay signature is also in strong contrast .",
    "the bound states due to strong yukawa coupling , which follow simply from the existence of new heavy chiral quarks without assuming new dynamics , should be easily distinguished from technicolor .",
    "the yukawa - bound ultraheavy mesons are also quite distinct from qcd bound states .",
    "not only there is the absence of @xmath33 ( where @xmath147 fusion would be possible ) and @xmath31 type mesons , they have a much larger binding energy , and are much smaller in size .",
    "this is brought about by not only a strong coupling constant , but facilitated by a @xmath40 coupling due to goldstone or longitudinal vector bosons ; the @xmath341 higgs boson , being heavy , would in fact be subdominant .",
    "thus , the tight bound states involve ultrarelativistic motion of its very heavy constituents , hence somewhat counterintuitive . by",
    "far we have not attempted any actual solution of the bound state problem here .",
    "we therefore chose to remain close to the unitarity bound , considering bound state masses not more than 1.5 tev .",
    "we have chose to parameterize with a few key parameters .",
    "our numerics , and associated phenomenology , should be viewed as only illustrative , with the _ key parameters to be determined by experiment_.    what mass scale would nature actually choose , if she so chooses to offer an extra chiral doublet above the existing three generations ? it may be related to the electroweak symmetry breaking through @xmath36 condensation .",
    "it could in principle lead to very deeply bound states , with binding energy approaching @xmath42 order or more .",
    "we have only scratched the surface of yukawa - bound heavy mesons , the treatment of which would require genuine nonperturbative methods , such as  @xcite lattice field theory .",
    "paradoxically , it is not impossible that heavier quark masses than considered here could result in lower heavy meson masses .",
    "again , experiment might take the lead here .",
    "with the experimental limits on sequential chiral 4th generation already at 500 gev , i.e. at the doorsteps of the unitarity bound , we have considered the possibility of new @xmath36 mesons bound by strong yukawa couplings . comparing a relativistic expansion approach ( which indicated nonapplicability ) , versus a relativistic bethe  salpeter equation approach , we chose to illustrate what might appear in early data of lhc running , i.e. bound states just above the tev scale , but with relatively complicated decay final states .",
    "electroweak precision tests suggest a new ( heavy ) isospin symmetry , such that the leading production would be a color octet , isosinglet vector meson , which we call @xmath148 . it can be produced via @xmath4 fusion , through an unknown decay constant , @xmath149 . for decay , the key parameters besides @xmath149 are the quark mixing element @xmath13 , and the mass differences @xmath262 and @xmath269 where @xmath221 is a heavy color octet  pion \" and @xmath238 a color singlet ",
    "we find the leading decay is likely @xmath285 , while the other transition channel into @xmath258 is relatively suppressed .",
    "the other leading decay is  free \" , or constituent , quark decay .",
    "illustrating with four cases for large / small decay constant , nominal / suppressed mass differences or @xmath13 , together with the two decay channels of free quark decay and @xmath11 decay of @xmath221 , we considered the possible lhc phenomenology .",
    "we find in general the @xmath37 to be narrow compared to its mass .",
    "the special case of small @xmath13 leads to two possible spectacular signatures .",
    "one is @xmath342 , where a massive back - to - back @xmath11 system is accompanied by a relatively soft @xmath15 .",
    "this mode could become suppressed if @xmath262 is close to or less than @xmath196 .",
    "then , one could have a dijet resonance close to current lhc limits , and a narrow dijet resonance could appear soon . in the general case ,",
    "dijet signal is suppressed by a decay branching ratio .",
    "other than the above two ( perhaps unlikely ) spectacular signals , the generic leading decay is @xmath343 , @xmath344 , followed by free quark decay of @xmath221 ( @xmath287 is typically subdominant ) .",
    "this leads to possible multijet signals with an associated relatively soft @xmath15 or @xmath292 tag , where the multijet system is very massive , and with multiple @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 jet substructures .",
    "if such massive multijet systems can be studied , one could possibly reconstruct both the @xmath221 and @xmath148 resonances . assuming single channel dominance",
    ", one can measure the meson decay constant by the total cross section .",
    "if @xmath285 is suppressed by kinematics , however , the likely leading decay would be by the constituent heavy quark decay , which is very similar to standard @xmath23 signal , except one heavy quark decays somewhat off - shell .",
    "since in any case the leading @xmath327 fusion does not exhibit resonance phenomena , _ the current 4th generation @xmath18 and @xmath19 search can continue beyond the unitarity bound_. but if 4 g quarks are discovered , then some good fraction of the events would have one quark decaying below threshold , indicating bound state phenomena .",
    "one , of course , would have to disentangle also @xmath285 , as already discussed .",
    "we have provide some definite signatures for yukawa - bound heavy @xmath23 mesons in the 1 to 1.5 tev range .",
    "but our study is only of precursory nature . as lhc energy increases , and with higher luminosity",
    ", it could uncover new chiral quarks above the unitarity bound , with new unusual bound states .",
    "one could probe into the truly nonperturbative regime , which our results only offer a glimpse of what might happen .",
    "there may be a host of new heavy mesons awaiting us beyond the horizon",
