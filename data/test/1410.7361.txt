    "most theoretical work on the switching of stt - mram@xcite has used the single - macrospin model@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is adequate for very small elements in which the exchange interaction keeps the local magnetizations parallel , but when the volume @xmath4 is small , the stability parameter ( energy barrier/@xmath5 , or @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is the anisotropy energy density ) is small . for elements large enough to be stable ,",
    "incoherent switching is possible .",
    "one reason why it has been difficult to understand incoherent switching is that multi - macrospin switching simulations lead to a bewildering variety of motions  precession can nucleate locally ( perhaps in more than one place at the same time ) , precession or reversed domains can grow and shrink in an apparently random way , especially if the element is overdriven ( _ i .",
    ", the applied spin torque is much higher than the critical spin torque for onset of precession ) .",
    "we have tried to simplify the problem by starting with the infinitesimal normal modes of oscillation about an initial uniform state , and continuing them to finite amplitude ( sec .",
    "[ section : norm ] ) .",
    "we assume a cylindrical stt - mram element of thickness @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 , with perpendicular anisotropy , stacked next to a pinned polarizing layer such that there is a spin torque proportional to the current in the llg ( landau - lifshitz - gilbert ) equation : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the total field , including the exchange , anisotropy , and magnetostatic fields ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the saturation magnetization , gyromagnetic factor , and ll damping .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 of the spin torque is proportional to current , and has units of magnetic field ( ka / m ) .",
    "the anisotropy field is just @xmath15 , normal to the plane , where @xmath16 .",
    "the simulations in this paper were done with our public - domain micromagnetic finite - difference simulator@xcite  the magnetizations are defined on a cubic lattice , the exchange field is a linear combination of neighboring magnetizations , and the magnetostatic field is computed using the fast multipole method ( fmm ) . we have omitted terms in @xmath17 since @xmath13 is small .",
    "to study the statistics of switching , we must first characterize the initial state . at zero temperature , this is the minimum energy state , which in an infinitely thin layer ( or in a discretization with only one layer vertically ) has magnetization vectors exactly along the normal ( z ) direction",
    ". we will refer to it as the `` flower '' state , because in a system with nonzero thickness the magnetization near the tops of the edges bends outward ( and inward at the bottoms ) . at low temperatures",
    ", we will have only small fluctuations from this state , and the system can be characterized by a complete set of normal modes .",
    "we have classified all of these normal modes and calculated many of them@xcite , but for the present purpose we need only the lowest - frequency modes , which have different symmetries that can be classified by an integer winding number @xmath18 : the magnetization winds ( about a vertical axis ) @xmath18 times when we move around the element circumference once .",
    "it turns out that these have the form@xcite @xmath19 where f(r ) is some smooth function .",
    "magnetostatic interactions make it impossible to calculate @xmath20 analytically  the best way we have found to compute the low - frequency normal modes is to start with a simple _ ansatz _ with the correct symmetry ( eq .",
    "[ ansatz ] with f(r ) = constant ) and let the system evolve according to the llg equation",
    ". in the case of the lowest - frequency mode ( @xmath21 , a quasi - uniform state ) the higher modes ( which will initially be present with low amplitudes because the _ ansatz _ is not exact ) will also have higher damping , and will gradually disappear , leaving the exact normal mode .",
    "we keep the lowest mode from disappearing by re - normalizing it after each cycle , or by applying a spin torque ( current ) to counter the effects of damping .",
    "the same can be done with the @xmath22 ( `` vortex '' ) and @xmath23 ( `` antivortex '' ) modes , except that the known lower mode must be projected out to keep it from growing .",
    "of course , it is not possible to study switching using infinitesimal perturbations of the initial state .",
    "we have been able to continue these normal modes to finite amplitudes , preserving the symmetry , by applying a current slightly higher than the critical value , so the amplitude drifts upward slowly .",
    "the amplitude can not be characterized by the precession angle @xmath24 , as in a single - macrospin model , since the angle varies over the element , so we will characterize it by the total moment @xmath25 ( which is @xmath26 in the single - macrospin model ) instead .    the critical current to maintain precession ( fig .",
    "[ figure : jc ] ) decreases as the precession amplitude increases ( because the anisotropy field it must overcome decreases ) , so if the current is held constant the amplitude will increase uncontrollably .",
    "thus we must decrease the current slightly at each time to ensure that the precession grows slowly ( quasi - statically ) .",
    "the result of this process is a unique exactly periodic orbit for each amplitude ( each @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ figure : jc ] ) .",
    "the orbit can be continued past symmetry - breaking instabilities , by projecting the magnetization configuration onto the symmetry of the desired mode . in particular",
    ", the coherent mode transforms as the @xmath27 representation of the rotation group@xcite while the instability discussed in the next section is a combination of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so by imposing @xmath27 symmetry , we can suppress the instability in fig .",

    "the calculation leading to fig .",
    "[ figure : jc ] is very stable for small amplitudes .",
    "but for larger amplitudes , there is a magnetostatic instability , shown schematically in fig .",

    "this clearly lowers the anisotropy energy * and * the magnetostatic energy , analogously to stripe domains in an extended film@xcite , so clearly is unstable if exchange is weak .",
    "the instability is also related to the suhl instability of fmr precession in bulk systems@xcite .",

    "@xmath35 ) .",
    "then we add a perturbation @xmath36 and evolve @xmath37 for one cycle to some configuration @xmath38 , defining the evolved perturbation @xmath39 .",
    "the map from @xmath40 to @xmath41 is the lyapunov map .",
    "the system is stable if the eigenvalues of this map are all @xmath42 .",
    "since this is a many - dimensional map , we can only determine its eigenvalues approximately .",
    "one approach which works well is to assume that the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues are near the subspace spanned by the low - frequency modes ( eq . [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath43 .",
    "the eigenvectors with the same symmetry ( @xmath21 ) as @xmath44 are easy to find ",
    "one corresponds to shifting the phase of the orbit ( @xmath45 ) and the other to increasing the amplitude .",
    "the @xmath46 modes are linear in @xmath47 and @xmath48  it turns out that they mix , but if we use the basis @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , in the first two ( `` @xmath53 '' ) there is a vertical nodal line , to the left of which the magnetization tilts to the left ( for @xmath54 ) and to the right of which it tilts to the right .",
    "the other two ( `` @xmath55 '' ) have a horizontal nodal line , and do nt mix with `` @xmath53 '' .",

    "if we start with an arbitrary perturbation @xmath71 and simply iterate the lyapunov map ( re - normalizing @xmath71 each time ) , components along eigenvectors with smaller eigenvalues will disappear , leaving us with the correct eigenvector , shown in fig . [",

    "subsequently the right edge reverses ( c ) , forming a domain wall ( with magnetizations precessing in the plane of the paper ) that moves to the left ( d ) .",
    "switching is complete when the wall reaches the left edge ( not shown ) .",
    "only relative times are meaningful , because the initial amplitude is arbitrary.,width=3 ]",
    "armed with this understanding of the magnetostatic instability , we can describe the switching mechanism and predict the rate .",
    "clearly at high temperatures there will be many modes excited , so it is conceptually useful to consider the low - temperature limit in which the average energy @xmath5 of the higher modes in a switching ensemble is much less than the energy in the quasi - uniform mode , which is biased in this ensemble to be near a switching energy @xmath76 .",
    "thus we will consider the limit in which the stability factor @xmath77 , although a realistic finite value probably behaves similarly . then in a switching trajectory , the quasi - uniform amplitude will perform a random walk , until @xmath78 , where the eigenvalue ( fig .",
    "[ eig ] ) passes 1 . at this point",
    "the system no longer evolves quasi - statically  the eigenvalue @xmath59 rises so quickly that the system will shoot out along the corresponding eigenvector , shown in fig .",
    "[ evol](a ) .",
    "( actually there are two degenerate eigenvectors differing by a @xmath79 rotation  linear combinations produce nucleation at different points around the perimeter . )",
    "as long as this always leads to switching , the details may not matter .",
    "we have looked at the evolution of this eigenvector  except for an initial latency@xcite ( time lag ) , it is independent of the initial amplitude of the eigenvector  thus the switching trajectory in this limit is essentially deterministic and unique ( except for spatial rotations and time translations )",
    "[ evol ] shows several configurations along this trajectory@xcite  the left half of the system [ where the perturbation ( fig .",
    "[ figure : mi ] ) narrows the precession cone ] returns to the initial direction , but a reversed domain is formed in the other side , mostly at the edge .",
    "this reversed domain expands by domain - wall motion , until the system is entirely switched .",
    "within the macrospin approximation , one can write a fokker - planck equation for the evolution of the probability distribution . in steady state",

    "the value for which @xmath1 is maximum , which is @xmath91 , giving @xmath92 when we generalize to a multi - macrospin model , @xmath93 wo nt change much ",
    "the main change is that there is an instability .",
    "we can construct a simple theory by keeping the single - macrospin @xmath94 but , if @xmath95 reaches @xmath96 before it reaches @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 , using @xmath99 .",

    "several approximations to the barrier are shown in fig .",

    "the parabola is the macrospin result ; because experiments give a straighter line , often the exponent `` 2 '' is omitted and the straight line labeled `` conventional '' is used@xcite . but also",

    "however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ barrier ] that both of these problems ( straightness and size ) can be resolved by using the instability energy to determine the barrier . in particular , the value @xmath105 we have found ( the lowest line ) gives a result close to the observed activation energies .",
