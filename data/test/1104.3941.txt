    "the study of the origin of nuclear deformation and its evolution as a function of proton and neutron numbers has attracted considerable theoretical interest from a large variety of viewpoints @xcite .",
    "experimentally , low - lying spectroscopy provides a very powerful source of information that allows one to establish signatures correlating the nuclear shape evolution with the energy spectra @xcite .    among many other nuclear structure models , self - consistent mean - field methods , based on microscopic energy density functionals ( edfs ) ,",
    "have provided both accurate and universal descriptions of different nuclear intrinsic properties including binding energies , ground - state deformations , density distributions , low - lying one - quasiparticle configurations , as well as the way nuclear shapes evolve with the number of nucleons @xcite .",
    "popular edfs are the non - relativistic skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite ones , as well as relativistic mean - field lagrangians @xcite . to describe nuclear spectroscopy one should go beyond the mean - field approximation to take into account the restorations of broken symmetries and/or the configuration mixing of intrinsic states in the spirit of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "in this kind of studies calculations may become computationally much more demanding and time consuming than the underlying mean field , particularly when triaxial degrees of freedom are included in the analysis .",
    "a sound approximation to the full gcm configuration mixing and/or the symmetry restoration is the five - dimensional collective hamiltonian with quadrupole degrees of freedom where both rotational and vibrational mass parameters are determined from the constrained , self - consistent mean - field calculations with a given edf and the collective potential is derived by the zero - point energy correction to the total mean - field energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , nuclear dynamics and spectroscopic quantities can be approximated by introducing appropriate bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite can be regarded as a nice example for this , and has been exploited in a large number of phenomenological studies focusing on the low - lying spectrum of medium - heavy and heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of the ibm is built on monopole @xmath5 and quadrupole @xmath6 bosons , which reflect the collective @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs of valence - shell configurations , respectively @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since the ibm itself should have a certain microscopic foundation , a hamiltonian of ibm has been derived conventionally from the shell - model configuration @xcite , and more recently from edf - based calculations @xcite .",
    "these mapping methods have been applied to realistic cases involving a variety of situations covering from nuclei with modest quadrupole deformation including @xmath9 -unstable ones @xcite , to strongly deformed rotational nuclei @xcite .",
    "also quantum - mechanical correlation effects in the ground state have been considered @xcite .",
    "starting from the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with the d1s @xcite parametrization of the gogny functional , the method of @xcite was used for the spectroscopic analysis of pt isotopes @xcite , and some of os and w isotopes @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the mapping procedure of @xcite to the mass region @xmath0 , extending the analysis made in @xcite to the neighboring exotic hf and yb nuclei .",
    "an additional motivation is to explore some possibilities to refine the predictive power of the method for the considered mass region . although the d1s parametrization of the gogny force is considered as a global edf able to describe many low - energy nuclear data with reasonable predictive power ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , we have preferred to use in this paper the gogny - d1 m functional @xcite .",
    "systematic explorations of different nuclear phenomena @xcite , including properties of odd nuclei computed within the equal - filling approximation @xcite , suggest that the new parametrization of the gogny - edf is as good as the standard d1s , a fact that we intent to confirm in this paper .",
    "it is well known that the nuclei in the mass region @xmath0 exhibit a transition between prolate and oblate equilibrium shapes as a function of the nucleon number , with the critical point around @xmath10 having a pronounced @xmath9 softness @xcite .",
    "these facts make the region a potential testing ground to understand the deformation properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "the evolution of the nuclear ground states in this mass region has been investigated recently with the constrained self - consistent mean - field method with microscopic edfs @xcite .",
    "both the ( constrained ) hartree - fock+bcs ( hf+bcs ) and the hfb approximations have been used to compute energy surfaces with quadrupole degrees of freedom in order to give a microscopic insight into shape transitions @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these studies that the triaxiality is an important ingredient to describe the evolution from prolate to oblate shapes , irrespective of the types of the edfs used .",
    "it should be kept in mind that pt , hg , and pb isotopes are well known @xcite for the spectacular coexistence of different low - lying configurations based on different intrinsic deformations as observed in their low lying spectrum .",
    "there are a number of works aimed at the understanding of the shape coexistence phenomenon in this region in terms of both edf - based microscopic calculations @xcite and phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , a short outline of the theoretical framework is given .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the energy surfaces , ground - state correlation energies , moments of inertia for the rotational bands , low - lying spectra , and the @xmath2(e2 ) systematics for the considered isotopes chains .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the concluding remarks and work perspectives .",
    "the analysis starts with a constrained hfb calculation using the gogny - d1 m edf .",
    "the constraints in this case refer to the mass quadrupole moments which are associated with the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath11 and @xmath9 in the geometrical model @xcite .",
    "the set of constrained hfb calculations , for each collective coordinate ( @xmath11,@xmath9 ) , provides the total hfb energy ( denoted by @xmath12 ) . for calculation details the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .    in other studies solving the five - dimensional collective hamiltonian @xcite , the collective potential energy surface",
    "is obtained by subtracting the zero - point energies for both rotational and vibrational motions from the constrained hfb energy surface .",
    "this corrected energy surface should be viewed as a collective potential energy surface . in the present work , the constrained hfb energy surface and the corresponding boson energy surface",
    "are compared , and they will be referred to simply as _ energy surface_. note that , as the total energy is considered , all ingredients including those relevant to kinetic terms are supposed to be taken into account to a good extent .    each point of the gogny - hfb energy surface @xmath13 is mapped onto the corresponding point on the bosonic energy surface , denoted by @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the deformation parameters for the boson system , in such a way that the bosonic energy surface fits the fermionic one @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the proton - neutron interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) @xcite because it reflects better the microscopic picture than the original version of the ibm without distinction of the proton and the neutron degrees of freedom ( often called ibm-1 ) . in",
    "what follows we denote the ibm-2 simply as the ibm , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the ibm energy surface is obtained as the expectation value of a given boson hamiltonian @xcite in terms of the coherent state @xmath17 .",
    "the coherent state represents the intrinsic wave function of the boson system , and is characterized by the deformation variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in principle , proton and neutron bosons might have different values of the deformation parameters , but since proton and neutron systems are supposed to attract each other strongly in medium - heavy and heavy deformed nuclei , the deformations of proton and neutron systems can be taken the same to a good approximation .",
    "if the separability of the mapping along the @xmath11 and the @xmath9 directions is assumed , one can consider the relation between the ibm and the geometrical deformation variables @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that , in general terms , the bosonic and the geometrical @xmath11s are proportional to each other and that the proportionality coefficient coincides with the ratio of the total nucleon number to the valence nucleon number counted from the nearest closed shells .",
    "we exploit this relation and assume that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being a numerical coefficient @xcite .",
    "the typical range of the @xmath19 value turns out to be approximately @xmath20 , which is about the same order of magnitude as the actual ratios of the total nucleon number to the valence nucleon number .",
    "regarding the triaxial parameter @xmath9 , the identification @xmath21 seems valid as indeed both geometrical and ibm @xmath9 s have the same meaning , ranging from 0 to 60 degrees .",
    "we adopt the ibm hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath22 where the first term @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) is identified as the @xmath6-boson number operator . the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bh ] ) stands for the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between proton and neutron systems , with @xmath27^{(2)}$ ] being the quadrupole operator for proton or neutron systems .",
    "the third term ( denoted by ll term , hereafter ) is relevant to the moment of inertia of the rotational band .",
    "@xmath28 is the angular momentum operator for the boson system with @xmath29^{(1)}$ ] .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bh ] ) is not the most general , but embodies all essential features of the low - lying quadrupole collective states .",
    "a more general ibm hamiltonian with up to two - body interactions contains many more terms than those considered here .",
    "however , these additional terms are supposed to be of little importance , and their implementation would increase the number of parameters , which makes the problem quite complicated .",
    ".[tab : ibmpara]the parameters for the ibm hamiltonian @xmath30 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bh ] ) , as well as the coefficient @xmath19 , obtained from the mapping of hfb to ibm energy surfaces for the considered yb , hf , w , os and pt nuclei with @xmath31 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     lastly , we examine the @xmath2(e2 ) systematics for a few essential cases corresponding to the shape transition .",
    "the @xmath2(e2 ) ratios relevant to the band - head of quasi-@xmath9 band , @xmath32 state , can be the stringent tests .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : be2 ] the ratio ( a ) @xmath33 and the branching ratio ( b ) @xmath34 for the considered isotopes in comparison with the data @xcite .    the @xmath35 e2 transition rate shows a certain sensitivity to the neutron number @xmath1 and thus it is useful as a signature of the structural evolution involving the @xmath9 softness .",
    "the @xmath36 ratios for pt isotopes differ notably from those of other isotopes . for yb ,",
    "hf , w , and os isotopes , the calculated ratio is peaked at @xmath37 .",
    "this confirms that in each of these isotopic chains the @xmath37 nucleus is softest in @xmath9 direction . on the other hand , for pt isotopes",
    "the calculated @xmath36 value keeps increasing toward @xmath38 to approach the o(6 ) limit , rather than taking a maximum at @xmath37 .",
    "this tendency appears to be consistent with that expected from the topology of the hfb energy surface @xcite and from the predicted systematics of the quasi-@xmath9 band - head in fig .",
    "[ fig : level2](a ) , which reflects that the @xmath9 softness persists for rather wide region in the pt isotopic chain .",
    "when compared with the d1s case @xcite , the present d1 m result suggests that the ratio @xmath39 is rather sensitive to the isotopic chains .",
    "in fact , in fig .  [",
    "fig : be2](a ) , the @xmath36 values below and above @xmath37 appear to have a certain @xmath3 dependence when the d1 m functional is used . for instance , the @xmath36 value for w isotopes is generally far from the o(6 ) limit all the way .",
    "it has been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that the calculated value of this @xmath2(e2 ) ratio is practically the same for os and w isotopes when the d1s functional is taken .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this @xmath3 dependence is observed experimentally .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : be2](b ) also presents a clear signature of the structural evolution involving triaxiality . for yb ,",
    "hf and w isotopes with @xmath41 , the branching ratio decreases from values close to the su(3 ) limit of 0.7 to the u(5)/o(6 ) limit of zero .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the transition from well deformed to @xmath9-soft nuclei as confirmed by the experimental data on os and w isotopes . at this point",
    ", one can observe the increase from @xmath37 toward the shell closure @xmath42 .",
    "the increase represents the deviation from the @xmath9 -soft character , as the corresponding mapped energy surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibm - pes ] exhibits notable oblate deformation .",
    "the change in the branching ratio occurs more slowly than the d1s case @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our general finding that the d1 m energy surfaces for these nuclei show less pronounced quadrupole correlation than the d1s ones . as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : be2](b ) , the branching ratios for pt isotopes remain always much closer to zero , which is compatible with their sustained @xmath9-soft character .",
    "in summary , the method of deriving the hamiltonian of the interacting boson model from the constrained hfb calculations with the gogny functional d1 m has been applied to the spectroscopic analysis of the neutron - rich yb , hf , w , os , and pt isotopes .",
    "the microscopic energy surface obtained from the constrained hfb calculation turns out to be a good starting point for both reproducing and predicting the ground - state shape of the considered nuclei .",
    "spectroscopic observables that characterize the underlying shape transitions , such as excitation energies , @xmath2(e2 ) ratios and correlation energies , have been calculated .",
    "it has been shown that the pt isotopes largely differ from the other isotopes in the rapidity of the shape transition . for most of the considered pt nuclei the mapped ibm energy surfaces",
    "are @xmath9 soft .",
    "the transition occurs more rapidly when departing from @xmath43 ( os ) through @xmath44 ( yb ) .",
    "the triaxial deformation helps to understand the prolate - to - oblate shape transition that occurs in the considered isotopes .",
    "the @xmath37 nuclei can be commonly identified as the transition points .",
    "this is most noticeably seen in the overall systematic trend of the band - head of the @xmath9 band @xmath32 , as well as in energy and @xmath2(e2 ) ratios .",
    "predicted spectra have been presented for the neutron - rich yb and hf isotopes , where a quite rapid structural evolution is suggested .",
    "when compared to the results from the standard gogny - d1s parametrization @xcite , the d1 m functional seems to be equally valid to describe the physics involved .    on the other hand , the present work aims at investigating the possible ways of refining the current model and clarifying its limitations when applied to the considered mass region .",
    "first , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : level ] , the discrepancy in the level structure of the quasi-@xmath9 band turns out to be a major limitation .",
    "it is likely that this discrepancy is mainly due to the use of the ibm hamiltonian not reproducing the triaxial energy minimum .",
    "a specific three - body ( cubic ) term may improve the agreement .",
    "second , the boson effective charges need to be determined in a microscopic way and effects beyond the mean field , like core polarization , should be taken into account",
    ". it would also be meaningful to compare the spectra and the electromagnetic transition rates resulting from the present method directly with those obtained from full configuration - mixing and symmetry - conserving calculations including triaxial degrees of freedom .",
    "this would help to quantify the predictive power of the employed model when applied to heavy exotic nuclei .",
