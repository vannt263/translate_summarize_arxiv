    "it is clear that further work is required to understand formally from a microscopic point of view the interaction mechanism responsable for the su potential .",
    "+ although the excitation energy centroids obtained for the h orbitals studied here differ from those reported previously @xcite , their locations are inside the excitation energy region where the relevant @xmath8 fragments were detected .",

    "explained in the book by nilsson et al .",
    "@xcite , the addition of a potential term ( linearly dependent on @xmath162 ) to the harmonic oscillator potential make possible the reproduction of the level ordering of the finite square well potential . in the same work ,",

    "@xcite , the agreement between calculated and experimental energies was not satisfactory .",
    "+ it is well known that the harmonic oscillator basis has been extensively used in shell models and mean field theories for spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite . due to the asymptotic behavior",
