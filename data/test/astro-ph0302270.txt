    "with the advent of chandra x - ray observations of radio jets , evidence supporting the synchrotron process for the origin of the x - ray emission from the jets of low luminosity radio galaxies has grown .",
    "one line of evidence is the similarity of the x - ray morphology to the radio and optical structures which are most likely synchrotron emission because of the detection of linear polarization .",
    "another argument is that the values of the spectral index of power law fits to the x - ray spectra are generally steeper than the radio spectra whereas inverse compton ( ic ) models predict @xmath2 , is defined by flux density , s  @xmath3 . ]",
    "( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 ; harris & krawczynski , 2002 ) .    in this paper",
    "we exploit another fundamental difference between ic and synchrotron emission : the variability time scale .",
    "although the injection of new relativistic electrons can produce the same rise time for both processes , the characteristic loss timescales are vastly different .",
    "all ic models require relatively low energy relativistic electrons . for synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) models , lorentz energy factors , @xmath4 , are normally comparable to the values of a few thousand which are responsible for the observed radio emission . for ic scattering between the relativistic electrons and photons of the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) , @xmath51000 ( harris & krawczynski 2002 ) .",
    "synchrotron models however require @xmath6 with corresponding half - lives of order a year for the sorts of magnetic field strengths commonly estimated for features in radio jets .",
    "our data show strong intensity variability from the unresolved core and hst-1 .",
    "we use the flux doubling time to derive an upper limit to the source size and the decay time to constrain the timescale for e@xmath7 losses , and in turn , @xmath1 .",
    "we take the distance to m87 to be 16 mpc so that one arcsec  =  77pc .",
    "in 2002 we obtained five observations of 5ks each on jan16 , feb12 , mar30 , jun08 , and jul24 . to minimize pileup , we used a readout time of 0.4s for the standard 1/8th subarray on the acis - s3 chip ( pug 2001 ) .",
    "data reduction followed the threads ( ciao2.2 ) . to recover the inherent resolution of chandra , we removed pixel randomization and rebinned the data to 0.1 native acis pixels . for 3 energy bands ( soft",
    ", s=0.2 - 0.75kev , medium , m=0.75 - 2kev , and hard , h=2 - 6kev ) flux maps were obtained by standard procedures ; a correction was applied for degradation of the quantum efficiency by measurement of fixed regions of hot gas emission near the jet .",
    "a wide band image was made by adding the 3 energy bands and fig .",
    "[ fig : sum6 ] shows the result of averaging our fluxmaps .",
    "our monitoring shows striking variability in both hst-1 and the unresolved core ( which could well come from jet segments closer than 0.4@xmath8 to the nucleus ) .",
    "the other knots show weak or no variability and will be analyzed in a future paper .",
    "contour diagrams of the core and hst-1 for each observation can be found in harris ( 2003a ) ; here we show lightcurves for the core and hst-1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the photometry was obtained by taking small circles with radii 0.44@xmath8 and subtracting the background from rectangles above and below the jet ( with a total area of 13.6  arcsec@xmath7 ) .",
    "the largest increase occurs for hst-1 between mar and jul with over a factor of two brightening in 116d .",
    "this implies that the emitting volume of the variable component has a characteristic size @xmath9  the light travel time which is 0.1pc for a stationary source .",
    "the brightening in the core between our last two observations showed a similar rate of increase with a 20% gain in 46 days .",
    "the relative increases in the three energy bands demonstrate a hardening of the spectrum for hst-1 between march and july 2002 ( compare the rates of increase in each band in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the intensity increase was a factor of 2.7@xmath100.3 for the hard , 1.7@xmath100.1 for the medium , and 1.6@xmath100.1 for the soft band .",
    "although we defer spectral analysis to a later paper , this hardening produced a change in the x - ray spectral index from @xmath11 ( prior to 2002 may ) to @xmath12 ( for 2002 july ) .",
    "the cleanest drop occurs for hst-1 between the 2002 january and february observations .",
    "the intensity ratios ( feb over jan ) for these 27 days are : 0.79@xmath100.09 ( h ) , 0.83@xmath100.04 ( m ) , and 0.87@xmath100.05 ( s ) .",
    "while these values are the same within the errors , there is a progression consistent with expectations for e@xmath7 losses ( but contrary to that of increased absorption ) : the hard band is dropping faster than the soft band .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the core decay between mar and jun : the hard band dropped 32@xmath107% while the medium band dropped 14@xmath105% .",
    "all of these timescales are subject to considerable error .",
    "although the statistical errors for the flux values are less than 10% , there will always be some flux present which is not part of the variable component and our sampling interval is not small enough to determine shorter variations .",
    "variability of a synchrotron source can result from a number of effects such as changes in any of the absorption along the line of sight , the magnetic field strength , b , the number of particles contributing to the radiation in a given band , or the beaming factor ( protheroe 2002 ) .",
    "adiabatic compression or expansion is particularly effective in changing the radiated power since the electrons gain or lose energy and at the same time , b changes to augment the effect .",
    "given a power law electron energy distribution n(e)@xmath13e@xmath14 , there should be no change in p. on the other hand , if the effects of a high energy cutoff extend down to the energy range of interest , a compression would cause an increase of intensity accompanied by a spectral hardening since the emission from a fixed observing band would come from lower energy electrons and the spectral curvature would be shifted to higher energies .",
    "however , for the remainder of this paper we focus on an alternative synchrotron model based on changes to the number of radiating particles .    for this model , increased intensity arises from the injection of new radiating particles with a spectrum flatter than that which existed previously . the spectral softening which accompanies flux decline comes from normal @xmath15 losses .",
    "the chief difference in these models is that the compression / expansion model requires that n(e ) departs from a power law .",
    "our data allow spectral curvature but the statistics are not good enough to demand curvature .",
    "in order to derive synchrotron model parameters , we need to know the overall spectral distribution of the emitted energy . both the radio and optical morphologies of the inner jet are shown in fig . 3 of perlman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with 0.2@xmath8 resolution . at higher resolution ( fig . 1 of biretta , zhou , & owen 1995 ) it can be seen that there are a series of several knots between 0.8@xmath8 and 1.2@xmath8 from the core .",
    "hst data demonstrate that the brightest upstream knot is slowly moving but the downstream knots are moving with an apparent speed of 6c ( biretta , sparks , & macchetto 1999 ) .",
    "our feature hst-1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sum6 ] ) corresponds to the upstream , optically brighter part of this segment of the jet .",
    "we take the radio flux density corresponding to the x - ray knot to be 3.8 mjy , as measured on the high resolution 15 ghz map . from a new vla observation , . ]",
    "we derive an upper limit of 2 mjy at 43 ghz .",
    "the optical flux densities come from the detailed spectral analysis at 0.15@xmath8 resolution based on data obtained in 1998 february by perlman et al .",
    "the spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spec ] , and for the purposes of sec .",
    "[ sec : sync ] , we approximate these data with a single power law between 10@xmath16 and 10@xmath17  hz with @xmath18=0.68 and amplitude determined by s(2kev)=100njy , parameters which describe the observables to within a factor of two .",
    "previous analyses have demonstrated that the x - ray jet emission of m87 is not thermal emission ( wilson & yang 2002 ; marshall et al .",
    "2002 ; biretta , stern , & harris 1991 ) ; is not ssc emission ( ibid . ) ; and is not ic / cmb emission because of the large values of @xmath19 and small angles to the line of sight required ( harris & krawczynski 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the knots are much steeper than in the radio or optical and strongly favor synchrotron radiation ( wilson & yang 2002 ) , confirming the conclusion of biretta , stern , & harris ( 1991 ) .",
    "our variability data is fully consistent with x - ray synchrotron emission and it remains only to demonstrate that plausible physical parameters can be found with a simple model which posits that the jet has a relativistic bulk velocity , as implied by the one - sided emission at all frequencies . in this section , we do that for hst-1 .",
    "using the time required for the flux to double provides an upper limit to the source size . to use the observed decline",
    ", we take the observed variables back to the jet frame , calculate the properties of the synchrotron source assuming equipartition conditions ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , and then evaluate the halflife of the electrons responsible for the x - ray emission , both in the jet frame and as observed at the earth .",
    "we also compare energy densities in the magnetic field and in the synchrotron photons .",
    "we performed these calculations for 8 values of @xmath1 between 1 and 16 . for converting various quantities to the jet frame and back",
    ", we used expressions from the appendix of harris and krawczynski ( 2002 ) .",

    "we find consistency for @xmath1 in the range 2 to 5 .",
    "however , the main conclusion is that regardless of the precise model and the actual values found for the rate of decline , the observed timescales for decay are fully consistent with the beaming parameters for a jet angle of order 10@xmath29 to 17@xmath29 ( to the line of sight ) suggested by the hst proper motion studies of biretta et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in their table 3 .",
    "larger beaming factors imply weaker fields and longer halflives , and vice - versa .",
    "a recent hst observation shows the varying region to be unresolved in the optical / uv , independently placing an upper limit of @xmath30 ( 1.5pc ) on its size ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "values of @xmath1 in the range 2 to 5 involve very modest synchrotron luminosities in the jet frame , equipartition magnetic field strengths of order 1 mg , and a total energy stored in particles and fields which can be supplied by a low drain on the jet kinetic energy , @xmath31erg  s@xmath21 , a value @xmath91% of the jet power estimated by young , wilson , & mundell ( 2002 ) . with these parameters ,",
    "the effective energy density of the cmb as seen by the jet is less than the synchrotron energy density for most choices of allowed @xmath19 , and the combined photon energy density @xmath90.2 of that in the magnetic field for all @xmath322 .",
    "thus the bulk of the energy loss is via the synchrotron , not the ic channel .",
    "the model predicts that the optical emission will decay with a timescale of order ten times longer than that we observe for the x - rays since @xmath33 . for a straight jet , an angle to the line of sight of",
    "@xmath34 implies a total jet length of just under 10 kpc .",
    "these estimates are based on decay timescales and our results would change if the actual decay time is shorter than our current estimate , in which case we would choose a smaller value of @xmath1 ; if the magnetic field is substantially less than the equipartition value and thus @xmath35 would be larger than calculated because of the weaker field and we would again choose a smaller @xmath1 ; or if the source size is substantially less than the light travel time which would mean that the field is larger than calculated , halflives would be shorter , and we would select a larger @xmath1 .",
    "we find that a synchrotron model with a beaming factor of @xmath1=2 - 5 gives a good fit to our observations for hst-1 and is compatible with radio and optical interpretations .",
    "it remains to be seen if similar models can be constructed for powerful jets such as that in 3c  273 .",
    "many of the gross features such as the progressions of x - ray emission being stronger close to the core , whereas the radio intensity increases moving out along the jet ; and the slight shifts in brightness ( radio brighter downstream of the x - ray peak for some knots ) are the same in m87 and 3c273 .",
    "it is also worth noting that if m87 were further away or observed with poor resolution , the variability which we now know arises from a knot in the jet might well be ascribed to conditions very close to the black hole ( as in blazar variability studies ) .",
    "we shall continue to monitor the jet of m87 with chandra between 2002 november and 2003 july with 8 observations and the jet will also be monitored at similar intervals with the hst .",
