    "we consider stochastic billiards ( knudsen random walk ) in two - dimensional infinite domains ( ` tubes ' ) of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a monotone smooth function",
    ". generally speaking , billiards are dynamical systems describing the motion of a particle in a region with reflection rules at the boundary : such systems have been extensively studied in the mathematical and physical literature . when the reflection rule is randomized , we have a stochastic billiard process .",
    "the stochastic models have received much less attention ; invariant distributions for stochastic billiards in general ( mostly bounded ) domains were studied in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the qualitative ( recurrence or transience ) and quantitative ( almost - sure bounds ) behaviour of stochastic billiards in _ unbounded _ domains in the plane .",
    "physical motivation for the billiards model comes from the dynamics of ideal gas models in the so - called knudsen regime where intermolecular interactions are neglected .",
    "the random reflection law is motivated by the fact that the particle is small and the surface off which it reflects has a complicated ( rough ) microscopic structure .",
    "the behaviour of such knudsen flows is of interest in several areas of physics , chemistry , and technology . for physical background , see for instance @xcite . for more on the motivation of the model in the present paper ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we mention some related models at the end of this section .    informally ,",
    "the model that we study can be described as follows .",
    "a particle moves ballistically inside the domain @xmath3 at constant velocity ( of unit magnitude , say ) , and each time that the particle hits the boundary , it is reflected at a random angle @xmath4 to the inwards - pointing normal at the boundary curve @xmath5 , where @xmath6 does not depend on the initial direction of the particle .",
    "so , inside the domain the motion is deterministic : the stochasticity is introduced via the distribution @xmath6 of the random reflections . in this paper , we take the distribution of @xmath6 to be symmetric about @xmath7 .",
    "we consider two types of problem : ( i ) the continuous - time motion of the particle in the tube ; and ( ii ) the discrete - time embedded process obtained by observing the instances of collisions on the boundary ( in other words , unit time elapses between reflections ) .",
    "the embedded process is , from our point of view , of interest in its own right ( and behaves very differently to the continuous - time process ) , and is also a vital ingredient for the study of the continuous - time process .",
    "the asymptotic phenomena that we study for each process are also of two main types : ( i ) recurrence or transience , and existence of moments for recurrence times ; and ( ii ) almost - sure bounds for the location of the particle at time @xmath8 , as @xmath9 .",
    "what kind of regions @xmath3 are of interest ? in the case of @xmath10 , our model becomes symmetrically reflecting motion in a strip .",
    "roughly speaking for the moment , the horizontal motion of the particle is then described by a random walk with zero drift , and so the model is null - recurrent . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath11 our tube is a wedge and , with our reflection rule , at any reflection there is a positive chance that the particle will head off to infinity and never return to a bounded set : it is transient . similarly if @xmath12 for @xmath13 , it is not difficult to show that the particle will follow nearby the deterministic trajectory which goes to infinity with linear speed .",
    "this dichotomy motivates the study of tubes with widths that grow sub - linearly , to probe precisely the transition between recurrence and transience .",
    "it is also natural to consider the case where the tube has decreasing width .",
    "the primary family of tubes to bear in mind has @xmath14 for some @xmath15 , although we do consider more general forms for the function @xmath16 .",
    "then there are two main cases : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "see figure [ tubes ] .",
    "we obtain criteria for recurrence and transience of our processes . loosely speaking ,",
    "these results imply , for example , that for @xmath19 the particle always has transient dynamics , but can be recurrent for @xmath20 depending on the reflection distribution .",
    "also , for very shallow tubes such as @xmath21 , the introduction of random reflections ensures that the process is recurrent , while the corresponding deterministic evolution along the normals is transient .",
    "( see theorem [ gen_g ] below . )",
    "we also obtain almost - sure bounds for the horizontal position of the particle , in both discrete- and continuous - time settings .",
    "thus we have information about the asymptotic speed of the processes .",
    "for example , when @xmath14 for @xmath22 , theorem [ time ] below implies that for all large times @xmath8 the continuous - time process is at position @xmath23 , ignoring logarithmic terms .",
    "in particular , the motion is _ super - diffusive_.    in the case @xmath18 , recurrence is evident . in this case",
    "we obtain a criterion for the finiteness of the mean recurrence - time ( roughly speaking , ` ergodicity ' ) .",
    "we also obtain polynomial estimates for the position of the particle ; the ergodicity has so - called ` heavy tails ' .",
    "a step in our proofs will involve relating the stochastic billiard process to an instance of the so - called lamperti problem ( after @xcite ) of a one - dimensional stochastic process with asymptotically zero mean drift . a crucial ingredient to our proofs for the stochastic billiard process",
    "is provided by some new results for general lamperti - type processes .",
    "these results ( theorems [ prop1 ] , [ lamp_low ] , [ prop6 ] ) are of independent interest , and are in some cases apparently new even for the nearest - neighbour random walk ( birth - and - death chain ) . to obtain our almost - sure bounds for lamperti - type processes , we state and prove some general results on obtaining almost - sure bounds for stochastic processes via semimartingale - type criteria .",
    "we conclude this section with some remarks upon related models .",
    "as previously mentioned , stochastic billiard models have received comparatively little attention .",
    "classical ( that is , non - stochastic ) billiard models have been extensively studied , particularly in mathematical physics , and the literature is vast ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "a common approach in the classical setting is via dynamical systems for which the reflection rule is elastic . in this setting ,",
    "we mention that billiards in certain unbounded domains resembling the tubes considered here ( at least for @xmath24 ) have been studied ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "an infinite - tube billiard model with a stochastic component ( cf the @xmath25 case here ) is analyzed in @xcite . in the dynamical systems setting , studying ergodicity is typically a primary goal . in the stochastic",
    "setting , the results of the present paper demonstrate a complete range of behaviours , from positive - recurrence ( roughly speaking , ` ergodicity ' ) , through null - recurrence , to transience .    in the next section",
    "we give a more formal definition of the model and state our main results .",
    "the statement of our auxiliary results on the lamperti problem is deferred to section [ lamperti ] .",
    "the rigorous formulation of the stochastic billiard model that we consider is essentially given in @xcite .",
    "we now describe the construction , which is modified slightly from that in @xcite to fit with our context .",
    "let @xmath26 , which will be large but fixed , to be specified later .",
    "for a monotone function @xmath2 , let @xmath27    while the continuous - time process is perhaps most natural to describe , it is more convenient to construct the discrete - time process first , and then to construct the continuous - time process from that .",
    "thus we define a discrete - time markov chain , informally obtained by recording the locations of the successive hits of the particle on the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "this is a markov chain with state - space @xmath28 that we denote by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , where for @xmath31 we write in coordinates @xmath32 .",
    "thus when @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we call @xmath35 the _ collisions process_. informally , the state @xmath36 represents the absorbing state achieved if the particle attains a trajectory that will never intersect with @xmath5 again .",
    "figure [ tubes ] illustrates the idea of the construction .",
    "we construct @xmath35 formally as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the distribution of a random angle @xmath6 where @xmath40 = 1 $ ] . for @xmath41 , given @xmath42 , we perform a step of our process as follows :    * if @xmath43 , set @xmath44 ; * otherwise , @xmath45 specifies a ray @xmath46 starting at @xmath47 with angle @xmath45 to the interior normal to @xmath5 at @xmath48 ; we adopt the convention that positive values of the angle correspond to the right of the normal ; negative values correspond to the left . *",
    "if the ray @xmath46 does not intersect with @xmath49 , set @xmath50 .",
    "otherwise , let @xmath51 be the first point of intersection of the ray @xmath46 with @xmath5 .",
    "then if @xmath52 , set @xmath53 , else set @xmath54 .",
    "this defines the discrete - time process @xmath35 .",
    "the randomness is introduced through the random draws from the reflection distribution @xmath6 ; if @xmath6 is degenerate ( i.e. , equal to a constant almost surely ) , then @xmath35 is deterministic .",
    "note that the construction ensures that @xmath55 whenever it is defined .",
    "we need some modified form of ` reflection ' away from the vertical boundary at @xmath56 , such as that specified by ( iii ) .",
    "this is for technical reasons , and in particular ensures that the process does not jump directly to @xmath36 , since that case will not be of interest to us here .",
    "the particular form of this ` reflection ' given by ( iii ) is rather arbitrary ; any comparable rule will leave the behaviour unchanged . moreover , if the distribution of @xmath6 has no atom at @xmath7 , we could instead take the reflection rule to be the same on all boundaries without changing the characteristics of the process .",
    "we obtain the continuous - time stochastic process @xmath57 with state - space @xmath58 , which we call the _ stochastic billiard process _ , from the collisions process @xmath35 , essentially by interpolation , as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath59 .",
    "define the successive _ collision times _ of the particle by @xmath60 , and if @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is euclidean distance on @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; if @xmath43 set @xmath66 .",
    "then for @xmath67 define @xmath68 so that @xmath69 for any @xmath67",
    ". then for any @xmath70 we define @xmath71 as follows : @xmath72 this defines the process @xmath73 , and in particular @xmath35 is embedded in @xmath73 via @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 ) .",
    "when @xmath77 , write @xmath78 in coordinates .",
    "a realization of the sequence @xmath79 therefore specifies the processes @xmath35 and @xmath73 via the construction just described .",
    "we now describe some further assumptions that we make on the function @xmath16 that specifies the region @xmath3 and on the distribution of the angle @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that the random variable @xmath6 for the angle of reflection satisfies for some @xmath80 @xmath81 = 1 , \\text { and   }   \\pr [ \\alpha \\geq x ] = \\pr [ \\alpha \\leq -x ] \\quad ( x \\in \\r ) , \\ ] ] so that @xmath6 is bounded strictly away from @xmath82 and the distribution of @xmath6 is symmetric around @xmath7 .",
    "of special nature is the degenerate case where @xmath83=1 $ ] ; this leads to a deterministic evolution ( i.e. , reflection always occurs along the normals ) .",
    "we will shortly introduce some assumptions on the function @xmath16 defining the domain @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath11 , @xmath3 is a right - cone , and at any reflection from @xmath5 there is positive probability ( in fact , @xmath84 \\geq 1/2 $ ] under condition ( [ alpha ] ) ) that the process @xmath35 ( hence @xmath73 ) will go to @xmath36 : this is an obvious case of transience . moreover , if @xmath6 is degenerate , then it is clear that for @xmath16 strictly monotone @xmath85 if and only if @xmath86 ; so transience is possible even if @xmath87 grows arbitrarily slowly , at least in this deterministic case . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath88 , we have that if @xmath6 is non - degenerate then @xmath89 performs a one - dimensional random walk on a half - line with zero drift and uniformly bounded jumps : so in this case @xmath35 will be null - recurrent ( loosely speaking for the moment ) . on another hand , it is at least intuitively plausible that if @xmath87 decreases sufficiently fast , @xmath35 will be positive - recurrent .    in the present paper we will interpolate between these three situations ; formally we assume :    * @xmath2 is monotonic , and thrice - differentiable",
    ". moreover , there exists @xmath90 for which , as @xmath91 , @xmath92 \\frac{g(x)}{x } \\\\",
    "g''(x ) & = [ \\gamma ( \\gamma-1 ) + o(1 ) ] \\frac{g(x)}{x^2}\\\\     examples of functions satisfying ( a1 ) include @xmath93 or @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "then in particular we will be interested in the two cases where in addition to ( a1 ) either : @xmath96 or : @xmath97    given ( a1 ) , a necessary condition for ( [ h1 ] ) is that @xmath98 ; a sufficient condition for ( [ h2 ] ) is @xmath18 .",
    "the conditions on the derivatives of @xmath16 imposed by ( a1 ) are natural smoothness constraints that are necessary for our purposes .",
    "a particular case that we will be interested in is where for @xmath15 , @xmath14 for @xmath99",
    ". then @xmath16 satisfies ( a1 ) and moreover satisfies ( [ h1 ] ) , ( [ h2 ] ) for @xmath17 , @xmath18 respectively .",
    "when @xmath100 , elementary geometry , using the fact that @xmath6 is bounded strictly away from @xmath82 , implies that @xmath35 ( and hence @xmath73 ) will almost surely never jump directly to @xmath36 , if @xmath101 is large enough ( see lemma [ cota_delta ] below ) .",
    "thus for the remainder of the paper we can take the state - space of @xmath35 to be @xmath5 and that of @xmath73 to be @xmath102 .    in the next section we state our main results . then in section",
    "[ open ] we mention some open problems , and outline the remainder of the paper .",
    "recall the parameter @xmath26 . set @xmath103 here and throughout the paper we use the convention that @xmath104 .",

    "similarly for the process @xmath35 , but with @xmath107 instead of @xmath108 .",
    "by the construction of our processes , we have that @xmath109 thus the classification of recurrence or transience transfers directly between @xmath35 and @xmath73 .    since @xmath110",
