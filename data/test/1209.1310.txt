    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    linear boundary problems are a crucial concern of applied mathematics  @xcite .",
    "one might thus expect a rich _ algebraic theory _ with _ symbolic algorithms _ , so as to support the exact solution and manipulation of a suitable class of boundary problems .",
    "alas , this is not the case yet",
    ".    there may be two reasons for this .",
    "one is that the classical algebraic theory of ( nonlinear ) differential equations , the _ differential algebra _ built up by ritt  @xcite and kolchin  @xcite , does not lend itself easily to boundary conditions : the elements of a differential ring or field are not functions but abstract objects that can not be evaluated at a boundary point .",
    "the other reason is of a pragmatic nature .",
    "if a differential equation can be solved at all , one tends to delegate boundary conditions to _ adhoc postprocessing _ steps that would adapt the integration constants / functions of the `` general solution '' .",
    "while this may be viable for linear ordinary differential equations ( lodes ) , the notion of general solution is much less useful in the case of partial differential equations ( lpdes ) : for example , there is not much point in solving the @xmath0 per se , but there are useful representations of those solutions that satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit disc ( poisson kernel ) .",
    "so even though we will be dealing only with lodes in this paper , the larger context of lpdes should be kept in mind .    in the admittedly modest case of _",
    "boundary problems for lodes _ , an algebraic theory was set up in  @xcite .",
    "the decisive step was to expand the well - known structure of a differential ring , complementing its derivation by a compatible baxter operator ( integral operator ) .",
    "this solves at once two problems : it provides the algebraic structure needed for expressing green s operators ( solution operators for boundary problems ) , and it yields an evaluation ( a multiplicative functional ) .",
    "the notion of evaluation is the key for imposing boundary conditions on the otherwise abstract objects of a differential ring ; one supplies as many evaluation as needed ( in addition to the one coming from the baxter operator ) .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the basic theory of  @xcite was refined and generalized .",
    "moreover , the authors have introduced a multiplicative structure on boundary problems that will also be crucial for our buildup of the heaviside calculus .",
    "the multiplication of boundary problems corresponds to the composition of their green s operators in reverse order ; see equation  .",
    "the framework of boundary problems of  @xcite was _ implemented _ several times : the first implementation was coded in mathematica / th@xmath1orem@xmath2  as an external package for boundary problems with constant coefficients .",
    "this version was superseded by a new implementation as an internal th@xmath1orem@xmath2  functor for generic integro - differential algebras in  @xcite .",
    "now in the third generation , the most recent implementation is the maple package  _ intdiffop _",
    "@xcite , which provides additional support for singular boundary problems ( all previous packages being restricted to regular boundary problems ) .",
    "[ [ heaviside - calculus . ] ] heaviside calculus .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our main concern in this paper is to build a bridge from the framework of symbolic boundary problems to the classical heaviside calculus  @xcite . since o.  heaviside s main idea , subsequently made rigorous by j.  mikusiski , was to treat the differential operator as a _ symbolic multiplier _",
    ", it is perhaps natural to reflect on possible connections to contemporary symbolic methods for differential equations . but why to symbolic boundary problems ?",
    "the answer lies in heaviside s so - called _ fundamental formula _",
    ", the algebraic analog of a well - known relation for the laplace transform . if  @xmath3 is the `` symbolic multiplier '' representing the differential operator and  @xmath4 is a suitable function , then one has  @xmath5 .",
    "the point is that  @xmath3 , which is supposed to be invertible in this calculus , must somehow `` remember '' the integration constant that is lost in differentiation .",
    "we will come back to this point in more detail ( section  [ sec : methorious - functions ] ) .",
    "at this point it suffices to say that an appropriate action of  @xmath3 on functions involves an evaluation operator .",
    "it is used in the heaviside - mikusinski calculus for incorporating the initial values associated to a differential equation , thus yielding at once the solution of the whole initial value problem .",
    "it is thus natural  staying in the frame of lodes  to ask if one can build up a more general calculus that would allow to incorporate multiple boundary values , given by several evaluation operators .",
    "the basic ideas of heaviside and mikusiski have been vastly extended , specifically by l. berg  @xcite and i. dimovski  @xcite .",
    "the latter has also broached a question closely related to the one raised above , namely the setup of _ nonlocal convolutions _",
    "@xcite and _ custom - tailored convolutions _ for boundary problems  @xcite . as far as we know , however , there are no direct generalizations of the fundamental formula from one to more evaluation operators acting on univariate functions .",
    "[ [ basic - setup . ] ] basic setup .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    our own approach is different in many respects . it does not qualify as an _ operational calculus _ in dimovski s understanding  @xcite , for whom its crucial feature is that `` operators '' and `` operands '' are merged in a single data structure , whereas algebraic analysis keeps the module of operand functions separate from the ring of operators . in this sense , we follow the line of algebraic analysis since we distinguish the ring of methorious operators ( section  [ sec : localization ] ) from the module of methorious functions ( section  [ sec : methorious - functions ] ) .",
    "moreover , our approach is genuinly algebraic while the hallmark of the heaviside - mikusiski tradition is an ingenious mix of algebra and analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our setup is close in spirit to the original heaviside - mikusiski setup , enjoying the following attractive features :    * its _ basic philosophy _ follows closely in heaviside s footsteps , making the differential operator invertible by `` remembering '' suitable boundary data . *",
    "it provides an algebraic structure that accommodates boundary problems for an _ arbitrary number of evaluation points _ as well as _",
    "nonlocal conditions_. * all boundary problems are covered _ uniformly _ , so one need not set up custom - tailored multiplications ( convolutions ) for each type of boundary conditions one wants to consider . *",
    "it illuminates the passage from one to several evaluations algebraically : localization takes place in a _",
    "noncommutative ring_. in contrast , convolution algebras are commutative by definition  @xcite . *",
    "the construction is _ generic in the coefficient algebra _ ( it works for the class of umbral integro - differential algebras ) .    from the viewpoint of analysis , however",
    ", the class of umbral coefficient algebras is rather limited compared to mikusiski s setup ( continuous or even @xmath6 functions on the positive half - axis ) . while this might be relaxed by suitable limit considerations ,",
    "this is not in the interest of the present paper , where we want to focus on the algebraic aspects .",
    "our goal in this paper is to build a _ first bridge _ between the algebraic theory of boundary problems  @xcite and heaviside s tactic of using `` symbolic fractions '' ( localization in a suitable convolution ring ) for integrating differential equations with initial / boundary data .",
    "in fact , it gives a new justification ( see after proposition  [ prop : greensop - localization ] ) for a notational device initiated in  @xcite : since then we have written  @xmath7 for the green s operator associated to a boundary problem  @xmath8 , originally chosen in view of the anti - isomorphism   mentioned above .",
    "the work in this paper may also be seen as an answer to an ( implicit ) question originating from  @xcite .",
    "the setting there was restricted to @xmath9 $ ] coefficients and treated via ore algebras .",
    "the object of central interest was the _ integro - differential weyl algebra _ , which has shown to have two important quotient algebras : the ring of localized differential operators  @xmath10[x]$ ] and the usual ring of integro - differential operators  @xmath9[{\\partial } , { { \\textstyle \\varint}}]$ ] .",
    "the former has @xmath11 as a two - sided inverse , but no action on  @xmath9 $ ] ; the latter has the action , but  @xmath12 is only a right inverse of  @xmath11 . now the question arises : can one build up a structure , with an action on  @xmath9 $ ] or other coefficient algebras , such that the derivation has a two - sided inverse ?",
    "we show in this paper that the answer is affirmative , provided the derivation is enhanced in a way similar to heaviside s symbolic multiplier  @xmath3 .    as always in algebra",
    ", localizing a ring sheds new light on its structure , especially in the noncommutative setting ( here the theory of fraction rings is somewhat more delicate due to the ore condition , see section  [ sec : localization ] ) .",
    "we hope this will also be the case for our present construction .",
    "but one must bear in mind that the subject has only been touched and various issues remain in a preliminary and unsatisfactory state ( see the conclusion ) .",
    "nevertheless , a wealth of new relations has been uncovered , and we are confident that they will allow interesting generalizations and refinements .",

    "we have already remarked in section  [ sec : methorious - functions ] that the current two - stage process of creating the localization  @xmath575 is unsatisfactory : in mikusiski s setup , all the `` ideal elements '' like  @xmath3 and  @xmath534 are an immediate result of the localization while we have to supply them offhand , prior to localization .",
    "we would like to find a better formulation in the future that will avoid this kind of inadequacy .",
    "one possible path towards such an improved localization is suggested by the prominent appearance of _ singular problems _ in the proof of lemma  [ lem : prob - left - permutable ] .",
    "it may be worthwhile to expand the ring  @xmath525_{\\phi}}$ ] to include ( all or some ) singular boundary problems .",
    "of course this will also increase the kernel of the corresponding extension ( we can not expect to invert singular problems ) , but perhaps the resulting ring of fractions is more natural . in particular , it may be possible to interpret the sum of two ( singular ) boundary problems in some useful way , in contrast to the formal sums of  @xmath525_{\\phi}}$ ] .",
    "the results of  @xcite will be useful for the work in this direction .    staying with the current construction , there are some obvious open questions : fist of all , the _ kernel of the extension _",
    "@xmath370 into the methorious operators should be determined , possibly by proving cojecture  [ conj : extension - kernel ] .",
    "likewise , the kernel  [ eq : kernel - hypfun ] of the extension  @xmath614 into the methorious hyperfunctions is to be computed .",
    "finally , we would like to draw attention to the interesting link between integro - differential algebras and the umbral calculus ( section  [ sec : umbral - bc ] ) , which deserves to be studied in more depth .",
    "there is also an intriguing relation  @xcite between the umbral calculus and the rota - baxter algebras ( both of these being favourite topic of g .-",
    "rota ) , which might benefit from the new perspective afforded by boundary problems in integro - differential algebras ( since the latter are special cases of differential rota - baxter algebras and hence of plain rota - baxter algebras ) . as a more mundane goal",
