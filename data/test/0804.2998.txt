    "coding for cooperative wireless relay networks has attracted considerable attention recently . distributed space time coding was proposed as a coding strategy to achieve full cooperative diversity in @xcite assuming that the signals from all the relay nodes arrive at the destination at the same time . but this assumption is not close to practicality since the relay nodes are geographically distributed . in @xcite , a transmission scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) at the relay nodes",
    "was proposed to combat the timing errors at the relays and a high rate space time block code ( stbc ) construction was also provided . however , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity for this scheme is prohibitively high especially for the case of large number of relays .",
    "several other works in the literature propose methods to combat the timing offsets but most of them are based on decode and forward at the relay node and moreover fail to address the decoding complexity issue . in @xcite , a simple transmission scheme to combat timing errors at the relay nodes was proposed .",
    "this scheme is particularly interesting because of its associated low ml decoding complexity . in this scheme",
    ", ofdm is implemented at the source node and time reversal / conjugation is performed at the relay nodes on the received ofdm symbols .",
    "the received signals at the destination after ofdm demodulation are shown to have the alamouti code structure and hence single symbol maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding can be performed .",
    "however , the alamouti code is applicable only for the case of two relay nodes and for larger number of relays , the authors of @xcite propose to cluster the relay nodes and employ alamouti code in each cluster .",
    "but this clustering technique provides diversity order of only two and fails to exploit the full cooperative diversity equal to the number of relay nodes .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows .    *",
    "the li - xia transmission scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for any number of relays .",
    "* the conditions on the distributed stbc ( dstbc ) structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified .",
    "the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable dstbcs in @xcite for synchronous wireless relay networks are found to satisfy the required conditions for application in the proposed transmission scheme . *",
    "it is shown how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity in the absence of channel knowledge and in the absence of knowledge of the timing errors of the relay nodes . moreover ,",
    "an existing class of four group decodable distributed differential stbcs @xcite for synchronous relay networks with power of two number of relays is shown to be applicable in this setting as well .      in section [ sec2 ] , the basic assumptions on the relay network model",
    "are given and the proposed transmission scheme is described .",
    "section [ sec2 ] also provides four group decodable dstbcs that achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity in the proposed transmission scheme for arbitrary number of relays .",
    "section [ sec3 ] briefly explains how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme and four group decodable distributed differential stbcs applicable in this scenario are also proposed .",

    "the proposed transmission scheme can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for arbitrary number of relays and is an extension of the li - xia transmission scheme@xcite .",

    "let us assume that the first @xmath25 blocks are modulated by @xmath26-point idft .",
    "then a cp of length @xmath28 is added to each block , where @xmath28 is chosen to be not less than the maximum of the overall relative timing errors of the signals arrived at the destination node from all the relay nodes .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 ofdm symbols denoted by @xmath29 each consisting of @xmath30 complex numbers are broadcasted to the @xmath11 relays using a fraction @xmath31 of the total average @xmath32 .",
    "if the channel fade gains are assumed to be constant for @xmath33 ofdm symbol intervals , the received signals at the @xmath13-th relay during the @xmath15-th ofdm symbol duration is given by    @xmath34    where , @xmath35 is the awgn at the @xmath13-th relay node during the @xmath15-th ofdm symbol duration . the relay nodes process and transmit the received noisy signals as shown in table [ table_proposed ] using a fraction @xmath36 of total power @xmath32 ( appropriate scaling of received ofdm symbols is assumed ) .",

    "decoding for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be done separately in every sub carrier due to the four group decodable structure of @xmath48 .",
    "in this section , we study the error performance of the proposed codes using simulations .",
    "we take @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the length of cp as @xmath51 .",
    "the delay @xmath17 at each relay is chosen randomly between @xmath52 to @xmath53 with uniform distribution .",
    "two cases are considered for simulation : ( 1 ) with channel knowledge at the destination and ( 2 ) without channel knowledge at the destination . for the case of no channel information ,",
    "differential encoding at the source as described in example [ eg_4relay_diff ] of section [ sec4 ] is done .",
    "when channel knowledge is available at the destination , rotated qpsk is used as the signal set @xcite .",
    "the transmission rate for both the schemes is @xmath54 bit per channel use ( bpcu ) if the rate loss due to cp is neglected .",
    "relay system with and without channel knowledge , width=3 ]    it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation ] that the error performance for the no channel knowledge case is approximately @xmath55 db worse than that with channel knowledge at the destination .",
    "this is due to the differential transmission / reception technique in part and also in part because of the change in signal set from rotated qpsk to some other signal set @xcite in order to comply with the requirement of scaled unitary codeword matrices .",
    "a drawback of the proposed transmission scheme is that it requires a large coherence interval spanning over multiple ofdm symbol durations .",
    "moreover there is a rate loss due to the use of cp , but this loss can be made negligible by choosing a large enough @xmath26 . in spite of these drawbacks , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first known amplify and forward based transmission scheme available for any number of relay nodes that admits low ml decoding complexity and also provides full asynchronous cooperative diversity . some of the interesting directions for further work are listed below :    1 .   constructing single symbol decodable distributed space time codes for the proposed transmission scheme .",
