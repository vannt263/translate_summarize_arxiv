    "in a contemporary context , the newtonian dynamics of a large number of self - gravitating particles describes the dynamics of putative dark matter , and to first order the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters .",
    "dark matter halos identified in cosmological simulations have similar ( and nearly ) universal profiles , independent of the cosmological parameters or the masses of the halos or the epoch of their identification .",
    "these profiles have essentially the same form as those fitting early type galaxies ( e.g. , navarro et .",
    "al . 1997 ; merritt et al . 2005 ) .",
    "yet there is no satisfactory theory predicting these preferred choices of dynamical equilibria .",
    "steady states are characterized by the absence of coherent collective modes , which decay due to differences between motions on neighboring particle trajectories and interactions between the coherent modes and individual particle motions .",
    "these effects represent generic mechanisms driving gravitational systems toward collisionaless equilibria , ending the initial phase of violent relaxation , with its singnificant potential fluctuations and accompanying changes in particle energies .",
    "the associated processes are often referred to as phase mixing and landau damping respectively ( binney & tremaine 2008 , hereafter referred to as bt ) and should be most efficient when nearby trajectories rapidly diverge and spread in phase space .",
    "however , attempts at relating these trajectory stability properties to the choice of @xmath0-body equilibrium  or extracting virtually any interesting information at all from them  are frustrated by the following phenomenon .    as @xmath1 ,",
    "particles are essentially affected by the mean field potential corresponding to the smoothed out mass distribution ( indeed , it can be rigorously proven that the mean field dynamics should describe asymptotically the time evolution of @xmath0-body system trajectories as @xmath1 ; braunn & hepp 1977 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-body problem is then transformed to @xmath0 1-body problems in this self consistent field , and steady state systems with sufficient symmetry are near integrable  e.g. , spherical systems are completely integrable when in a steady state , supporting only regular orbits , which conserve as many isolating independent integrals of motion as degrees of freedom     the phase space distances between trajectories moving on regular orbits generally diverges linearly in time  ( bt ) .",
    "thus the distance between trajectories of systems with only regular orbits should also diverge linearly in time .",
    "this should imply that , for an @xmath0-body system with smoothed out potentials supporting only regular orbits , any exponential divergence timescale ( indicating irregular trajectories and chaotic dynamics ) should tend to infinity as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "nevertheless , paradoxically , it has long been realized that point particle @xmath0-body systems invariably reveal exponential divergences on a timescale that does not increase with @xmath0 , even for systems with smoothed background potentials that only support regular orbits ( miller 1964 ; goodman , heggie & hut 1993 ; kandrup & sideris 2001 ; hemsendorf & merritt 2002 ) .",
    "this miller instability however saturates at progressively smaller scales as @xmath0 increases , and trajectories moving within a distribution of fixed point particles have been found to behave more and more like smooth potential counterparts as the number of background particles increased ( valluri & merritt 2000 ; kandrup & sideris 2001 ; hut & heggie 2002 ) .",
    "this suggests that the miller instability is a direct consequence of representation in terms of point particles and that it is of little relevance if one is concerned with the gross structure and macroscopic evolution of large-@xmath0 gravitational systems .",
    "furthermore , when the singularity in the potential is removed ( e.g. when @xmath2 ) , the exponential divergence timescale between neighboring trajectories does increase with @xmath0 ( goodman , heggie & hut 1993 ) and correlate with the evolution of dynamical variables like angular momentum ( el - zant 2002 ) .",
    "it also worth noting that rigorous derivation of the approach toward the mean field limit in large-@xmath0 gravitational systems requires a smoothed two body potential ( more precisely , @xmath3 is required to have continuous and bounded first and second derivatives ; braun & hepp 1977 ) .",
    "this again suggests that , if progress is to be made in understanding the the evolution of macroscopic quantities ( e.g. , density and velocity dispersion profiles ) in terms of the dynamical stability of trajectories , one has to move beyond the anomalous case of discrete point particles .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to show that , when the singularity in the two - body potential is removed , physically interesting information , pertaining to the choice of equilibrium , can be extracted from the stability properties of @xmath0-body trajectories .",
    "this will be done by using a geometric method for characterizing stability ( section  2 ) , where the incompleteness of the pure point particle description of trajectory stability is clearest . when the singularity in the two body potential is smoothed the miller instability is removed .",
    "what transpire instead are relations between macroscopic quantities characterizing equilibrium configurations ( as described in section  3 ) . in section  4 , we propose an interpretation of the approach to equilibrium and associated damping of coherent modes in terms of the stability properties of a system s trajectories ; in section  5 this interpretation is tested and discussed .",
    "an explanation of the origin of equilibrium ( spatial and phase space ) density profiles of dark matter halos and elliptical galaxies follows from the context thus set .",
    "the divergence of nearby trajectories can be also be deduced from geometric representations of motion and stability in gravitational systems ( e.g. , gurzadyan & savvidy 1986 ; kandrup 1990 ; cerruti - sola & pettini 1995 ; el - zant 1997 ; el - zant 1998 ) . though the geometric description is not unique ( e.g. , casetti et .",
    "al . 2000 ) , one well known formulation has the advantage of involving a positive definite metric defined directly on the lagrangian configuration manifold . for free particles ,",
    "this manifold is simply the euclidean space spanned by the @xmath4 particle coordinates . in general",
    ", a system will move on a curved subspace , with velocity vectors defining its tangent space ( the phase space being the cotangent bundle ; arnold 1989 ) .",
    "a locally euclidean structure is generated on this space by the quadratic ( in the coordinate derivatives ) form of the kinetic energy ( arnold 1989 ) . for a system conserving its total energy @xmath5 ,",
    "the associated conformally flat metric can be expressed in terms of the cartesian coordinates and the system kinetic energy @xmath6 as ( e.g. , lanczos 1986 ) @xmath7 the curvatures associated with this metric determine the stability of its trajectories . at the simplest intuitive level , it is clear why curvature should be related to stability .",
    "for example , the distance between neighboring geodesics ( great circles ) on a sphere oscillates sinusoidally as one moves from pole to pole , while geodesics on a negatively curved saddle are hyperbolic and diverge away from each other .",
    "the case of a flat plane corresponds to marginally stability , with distance between straight lines increasing linearly along their lengths .    in the present case ,",
    "the variation of the normal distance between neighboring geodesics ( and therefore dynamical trajectories ) defined by the above metric is determined by the two dimensional sectional curvatures @xmath8 in @xmath9-dimensional configuration space , where @xmath10 is the system velocity vector and @xmath11 define directions normal to it . and it can be rigorously shown that when all the @xmath8 are negative , trajectories are exponentially unstable  ( anosov 1967 ; arnold 1989 ) .",
    "isotropic @xmath0-body systems with singular two - body potentials are predicted to tend toward this state as @xmath0 is increased and direct two - body collisions are ignored  ( gurzadyan & savvidy 1986 ; kandrup 1990 ) . perplexing trends , similar to those obtained from direct calculations ( i.e. exponential divergence timescales that do not increase with @xmath0 ) , are then recovered when the full gravitational field is taken into account  ( kandrup 1990 ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of representing the matter distribution in terms of discrete point particles . in this paper",
    "we wish to move beyond this anomalous case",
    ".    we will be interested in how spherical @xmath0-body systems with isotropic velocities damp out fluctuations , we therefore seek an averaged measure of their response to random perturbations . averaging the two dimensional curvatures over all possible directions @xmath12 and trajectories ( geodesics ) at a given point in configuration space one obtains the the ricci scalar ; which , for @xmath13 , can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the gradient and laplacian , taken with respect to coordinates @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are their particle masses ( which will be assumed to be equal ) .    the complete equations for trajectory stability will involve the two dimensional curvatures , and are usually written in terms of the geodesic distance @xmath19 ( e.g. , kandrup 1990 for a clear derivation ) .",
    "a correspondingly transformned equation measuring average stability  involving the scalar curvature and describing stability in the time domain  is given by  ( e.g. , cerruti - sola & pettini 1995 ) @xmath20 here @xmath21 measures the mean divergence of trajectories and @xmath22 near dynamical equilibrium , @xmath23 and the dominant term on the right hand side will be the curvature term . for singular newtonian potentials , eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) predicts negative @xmath24 ( since the first term vanishes ) , and exponential instability is present even in the case of spherical equilibria .",
    "however , because of the singularities present when any two particle trajectories cross , one is here dealing with an incomplete manifold ; it is not clear if straightforward application of the geometric approach remains appropriate in this case  ( abraham & marsden 1978 ) .",
    "the miller instability thus figures again as a direct consequence of discrete representation in terms of point particles . as it will now be show however , the predictions are qualitatively different , and much more interesting , when one moves beyond this particular case .",
    "when the singularity in the potential is softened , and as @xmath1 , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) represents ( through the poisson equation ) a smoothed out density field integrated over the particle distribution ( with the softening length acting as smoothing parameter ) . in dynamical equilibrium , the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) are then comparable , reflecting a kinetic pressure versus gravity balance . to see this ,",
    "assume @xmath25 .",
    "in this case , one finds that @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the density and acceleration at the position of particle @xmath29 . this reflects a balance between a pressure term ( a density multiplied by the velocities squared ) , and a gravitational binding term ; it is therefore expected to be at least approximately satisfied for systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "in fact , by dividing by @xmath0 and defining @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 as the means square speed of particles and @xmath33 , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath34 assuming that , in terms of a system characteristic length scale @xmath35 , we can write @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then eq .",
    "( [ eq : equ ] ) simply implies that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is characteristic of systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the results obtained thus far suggest that the two terms of eq  ( [ scalar ] ) should be of the same order in the case of systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that such configurations will correspond to small values of @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , this does not imply that @xmath24 will exactly be zero for all such systems .",
    "in particular , as shown in appendix  a , @xmath24 will not vanish for systems dominated by nearly constant density isothermal cores , which are the natural product of the process of classic violent relaxation gone to completion ; ; lynden - bell 1967 ; nakamura 2000 ) .",
    "however , it has been known for sometime now that such distributions do not match those of elliptical galaxies or dark matter halos . instead , of all possible collisionless near - spherical equilibria ,",
    "these structures exhibit a narrow range of density profiles , characterized by central cusps that can be reasonably described by single power laws and extended halos with steeper power laws .",
    "it is therefore natural in our context to ask whether the latter correspond to @xmath41 ; and whether , in general , this condition gives us any insight into choice of gravitational equilibriia resulting from violent relaxation .",
    "we tackle the second question first , leaving the first one to the next section .",
    "in this regard we recall that @xmath24 describes the stability characteristics of trajectories ( through eqs .  3 and 4 ) . in dynamical equilibrium trajectories",
    "are stable if @xmath24 is positive and diverge exponentially if @xmath24 is negative .",
    "before equilibrium is reached however the density and potential of a system started far from equilibrium will fluctuate .",
    "these fluctuations can lead to trajectory instability even if the average @xmath24 is positive .",
    "the associated divergence and phase space mixing should result in the damping of coherent modes ; and large scale fluctuations can only last up to and untill till these collective motions are damped .",
    "this means that the system should settle in a collisionless steady state when it finds a configuration where its response to fluctuations is least coherent ; and this should correspond to dynamical equilibria where the trajectory divergence and phase mixing in response to fluctuations are maximal . at the same time",
    ", it is required that , in the absence of fluctuations , trajectories of a spherical system should not be exponentially unstable in the infinite-@xmath0 limit , so as to recover an integrable system .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 can not be negative when the system is in exact equilibrium .",
    "( [ eq : stab ] ) suggests that configurations that satisfy these requirements have @xmath41 at equilibrium .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively : if average @xmath24 is positive and large , fluctuations ( in @xmath24 and @xmath42 ) have a smaller effect , and solutions of ( [ eq : stab ] ) tend to those of a harmonic oscillator ; conversely , if the average @xmath24 is near zero , @xmath43 is dominated by fluctuations , which can lead to significant instability , especially that in that case fluctuations in @xmath43 can lead to negative values .",
    "a system starting far from equilibrium , with initial conditions that allow for violent relaxation , should then end up in such marginally stable states .",
    "this intuitive argument is investigated more detail in appendix  b for the case of periodic oscillations and stochastic fluctuations . in the next section numerical simulations",
    "will be presented that suggest that systems starting further from equilibrium do indeed end up with @xmath24 closer to zero . but",
    "before closing this section it is important to note that though the above interpretation stands in seeming contradiction with that proposed by kandrup and collaborators , whereby it was suggested that trajectory divergence causes relaxation rather than subduing it , the clash here is only partial .",
    "the aforementioned authors reached their conclusions while studying trajectories moving through either stationary non - integrable potentials ( e.g. kandrup & siopis 2003 ) , or in particular spherical potentials with time dependent mass or length scales ( but which were otherwise rigid and fixed ; e.g kandrup et .",
    "al . 2003 ) . in the latter case they found that the time dependence can be a significant source of trajectory divergence , which may drive phase space mixing associated with violent relaxation .",
    "up to this point there is no contradiction with the interpretation outlined above ; fluctuations in the density and potential will indeed lead to trajectory instability and phase space mixing .",
    "however , when one takes into account the evolution of the self consistent field , it will be realized that the trajectory divergence and phase space mixing should also lead to the decay of the very collective modes that are causing the time dependence ( and associated trajectory instability , mixing and relaxation ) in the first place .",
    "when these are efficiently damped , no further evolution can occur ( in the collisionless limit ) .",
    "this is in line with our contention that the final product of violent relaxation do not correspond to classic most probable configurations but to ( quite different ) ones , which are most efficient in damping out collective modes via trajectory instability and associated phase space mixing .",
    "we now examine the above interpretation by means of direct @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "since we are interested in estimating the densities and accelerations in the continuum limit , we use a technique  ( hernquist & ostriker 1992 ) , which expands the density and potential in smooth functional series . in this study , we are interested in strictly spherical configurations and the results described below only make use of the radial expansions in this scheme , which is carried up to order @xmath44 ( however it has been verified that the results are not significantly altered if azimuthal expansion terms are included , as noted in the discussion below ) .",
    "systems are sampled using a @xmath45 particles ( except for one case with 500 000 as also described below ) , and started from homogeneous spatial initial conditions inside a unit sphere of unit mass .",
    "this configuration has a natural timescale @xmath46 , which will be our time unit .",
    "we have run configurations starting with isotropic velocities that are either constant or following various decreasing or increasing functions of radius .",
    "the results shown here correspond to the latter case , for the following reason . unless the initial velocities are vanishingly small",
    ", uniform initial velocities will imply that the initial pseudo - phase space density @xmath47 , does not diverge anywhere . on the other hand",
    ", collisionless evolution implies that @xmath48 generally decreases along particle trajectories  ( bt ) , so that the maximal final @xmath48 can not exceed the initial one .",
    "one of our aims is to explain the dynamical origin of cosmological halos , which have ( a centrally divergent ) @xmath49  ( taylor & navarro 2001 ) , which in turn requires an intial phase space density that is also divergent ( so that this initial density can , in principle , be mapped via collisionless dynamics into that characterizing dark halos . from among various functional forms satisfying this condition that were tried ,",
    "results will be shown for initial @xmath50 , noting that the trends reported seem generic .",
    "we vary the initial virial ratio @xmath51 from @xmath52 , corresponding to near equilibrium , to @xmath53 , corresponding to a system started far from equilibrium .",
    "given the sampling errors for finite @xmath0 , @xmath24 will never tend to zero exactly in practice ; and the absolute values of the densities and accelerations ( and local dynamical times ) strongly depend on the central concentrations of the final configurations .",
    "a relative measure is thus required for comparing these .",
    "we use the normalized quantity @xmath54 which measures the departure from equality in eq .",
    "the results are in fig .  1 , which shows that the equilibrium @xmath55 is indeed always of order unity or less , and that the further from equilibrium the initial state , the closer the evolved system is to a configuration that minimizes @xmath56 , in line with the general interpretation presented in the previous section . the initial @xmath55 is zero when @xmath57 ; systems with initial @xmath58 start with @xmath59 and then explore state space until they achieve configurations where ( according to eq .",
    "[ eq : stab])oscillations are efficiently damped .",
    "we note that a similar trend was found when systems were started with constant initial phase space density @xmath48 , except that generally larger final values of @xmath55 are obtained .",
    "the origin of the density profiles of bound structures identified in the context of cosmological simulations have been intensely investigated ; the mechanism for their advent was sought for example in terms of the merging histories of smaller structures in the way of forming larger halos ( e.g. , syer & white 1998 ; dekel et .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , the same sort of structures tend to materialize even in simulations where a cutoff has been applied to the power spectrum and the collapse is monolithic ( e.g. , huss et .",
    "; moore et .",
    "1999 ; wang & white 2009 ) .",
    "these profiles thus seem to arise nearly independently of the condition of their formation ; merging may conserve their form ( e.g. , boylan - kolchin & ma 2004 ; el - zant 2008 ) , but is not necessary to its genesis .",
    "it is thus natural to inquire if a simple explanation may be sought in terms of the stability issues we have addressing in this paper . we know from the previous subsection that systems started far from equilibrium to undergo simple monolythic collapse have near - zero final average curvatures ; they are therefore marginally stable according to the interpretation outlined in section  4 .",
    "if , as it is suggsted , violent relaxation should generically terminate in such states , and if violent relaxation is predominatly responsible for the structure of dark halos , then those halos should correspond to configurations with near - zero curvature .",
    "this would be the case if they corresponded to the final configurations of our simple collapse simulations  despite the lack of cosmological context or associated merging processes in these simulations .",
    "indeed , one finds , as shown in fig .  2 , that the equilibrium density and phase space density profiles of systems started far from equilibrium and undergoing simple monolithic collapse , starting from cold initial conditions , are remarkably similar to those of cosmological halos ( and also shallow cusp elliptical galaxies ; merritt et al . 2005 ) , despite the lack of cosmological context .",
    "systems started from virial equilibrium on the other hand tended to end a up with large central cores ( as do systems started with initial phase space density profiles that disallow the final configurations shown ) .",
    "this simulation was repeated with several values of radial and azimuthal expansion orders in the herquist - ostriker scheme , including one simulation with @xmath60 particles and 20 radial expansion terms and 12 azimuthal ones , without significant change in the results .",
    "there are some difference between the configuration shown and idealized halo profiles .",
    "our outer density profile is steeper than the @xmath61 form of cosmological halos ; however finite configurations can not have @xmath61 outer profiles .",
    "( cosmological halos are not isolated equilibrium structures as their outer regions are subject to mass infall , which reduces the steeness of the outer profile ; e.g. , gott 1975 ) .",
    "the functional form of our empirical spatial density fit is also slightly different from standard nfw ( where @xmath62 ) , and there seems to be some flattening toward the center of the @xmath63 cusp . yet",
    ", similar departures from ideal nfw often also apply to cosmological halos ( navarro et .",
    "al . 2004 ) .",
    "our argument for the production of the universal profiles  when the initial phase space density allows for their advent  is that the associated configurations are most efficient in damping out large scale coherent oscillations .",
    "we now explicitly verify that among the configurations we have simulated ( which always have positive or near zero average curvature once they reach a quasi - steady state ) , those with smaller @xmath55 do efficiently damp out fluctuations .",
    "this is already apparent in fig .  1 , where fluctuations are quickly damped for such systems .",
    "this may be intuitively expected , for these systems lack homogeneous harmonic cores with nearly constant orbital frequencies and coherent response , and similar trends were indeed observed previously ( e.g. , david & theuns 1989 ) . indeed",
    "( 3 ) allows in principle for the existence of long lived coherent modes when the average @xmath24 is large ( as discussed in appendix  b ) .",
    "further verification is obtained by perturbing the final states and measuring variations in the density distributions as systems , so perturbed , are evolved . the results of one such experiment , where the spatial coordinates were decreased by @xmath64 ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    ", the system that was perturbed from a state with smaller @xmath56 is seen to quickly settle back to an equilibrium that is closer to the unperturbed one , and to gradually close in further on it ( as the outer regions , with large crossing times , evolve .    from the above , one can conjure that the observed robustness of the universal profiles when perturbed may also be a reason behind their conservation under processes involving significant potential fluctuations  such as mergers , accretions and fly bys  that are important in the context of cosmological simulations .",
    "finally we note that , despite the formal similarity between profiles of elliptical galaxies and dark halos , the above interpretation strictly speaking applies only to the advent of dark halo configurations .",
    "the case of early type galaxies is much more complicated .",
    "the currently favored theory for the formation of early type galaxies involves a two - phase process : a highly dissipative initial stage accompanied by intense star formation , followed by a succession of dissipationless mergers ( e.g. , oser et .",
    "al . 2010 ) .",
    "the simple dissipationless collapse simulations presented here are evidently not of direct relevance to this rather involved two - phase model . however",
    ", though the initial phase is highly dissipative , it sets the initial conditions for largely dissipationless dynamics , presumably dominated by significant fluctuations characterizing an evolving time dependent system ( this should be especially the case if star formation is sufficiently efficient and the associated burst sufficiently intense ; indeed , oser et .",
    "al . suggest this phase bears an uncanny resemblance to claasic monolythic collapse models ) .",
    "if the general interpretation ( of section  4 ) is correct , marginally stable systems should in principle be generic products of such a situation .",
    "furthermore , as noted above , resulting profiles should be conserved in the second phase ( of dissapationless merging ) .",
    "this seems plausible ; however it is evidently beyond the scope of this paper to explicitly test the interpretation presented here in the complex context of the two - phase theory of the formation of early type galaxies .",
    "our main concern in this paper has been with the way mean field fluctuations are damped as a result of the mixing that occurs due to the instability of phase space trajectories .",
    "historically , however , it has been ( controversially ) argued that when trajectory instability stems not from large scale fluctuations but from discreteness noise , a new mode of relaxation , different from standard two body relaxation and with a correspondingly different timescale , arises ( gurzadyan & savvidy 1986 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction and in section  2 , when the full self consistent gravitational field is taken into account , and with a singular potential , the prediction is that system trajectories will always be unstable on the timescale of a dynamical time or less ( the miller instability ) .",
    "gurzadyan & savvidy on the other hand employed a holtsmark distribution ( e.g. , chandrasekhar & von neumann 1942 ) , where the force function is not self consistent but is dominated by nearest neighbor interactions ( and thus varies as  @xmath65 ) .",
    "they thence deduced that the instability timescale scales varies as @xmath66 , and identified this with a new collective relaxation time .",
    "three things are to be noted in our present context .",
    "first , assuming that that fluctuations due to discreteness noise ( in the curvature and associated quantities , as density and force ) scale as @xmath67 , then eqs .  ( [ eq : stab ] ) and ( a3 ) predict that , when the curvature is much larger than discreteness noise fluctuations , unstable trajectories would diverge on a timescale @xmath68 ; while @xmath69 when the reverse is true . thus , for statistically significant @xmath0 and unless the curvature is extremely closely fine tuned to zero , the divergence timescale for nearby trajectories will scale more as the standard two body relaxation time than the gurzadyan & savvidy timescale .",
    "secondly , even with an @xmath70 scaling , the source of the instability in our case are fluctuations around a near - zero curvature , calculated taking into account the full self consistent field , and not a small negative curvature arising from closest neighbor forces , as in the calculation of gurzadyan & savvidy .",
    "the third point concerns interpretation . relaxation on the two body timescale , as usually understood in stellar dynamics , is accompanied by structural changes in the collisionless equilibrium configuration of the system , due to diffusive random walks undergone by the integrals of motion associated with the mean field potential ; e.g. , energy relaxation leads to core contraction and collapse .",
    "whether divergence between neighboring trajectories directly leads to such effects on the corresponding exponential timescale is not clear , since such divergence will include changes in phases between particle trajectories as well vartiations in the integrals of motion associated with the corresponding trajectories in the mean field potential .",
    "much further detailed investigation would be needed to establish a precise relation ( if any ) with relaxation as normally understood in stellar dynamics .    on the other hand",
    ", it seems clear that the efficiency of phase space mixing due to exponential divergence should directly correlate with the decay of coherent collective modes , as even simple phase mixing ( without any exponential instability or changes in the integrals of motion ) is effective in damping of these modes .",
    "thus the interpretation of the effect of trajectory divergence in the context of the present paper appears to rest on firmer ground .",
    "an analogous interpretation in the case of discreteness noise is that the timescale of decoherence of collective modes should depend on the number of particles in the system ( as observed , e.g. , by david & theuns 1989 ) .",
    "it is hoped that the present exploratory study has shown that the methods employed , which have hitherto been of little use , are potentially powerful tools in understanding the structure of gravitational systems ; and that it would stimulate further work on these fundamental  yet lately little researched  problems pertaining to the evolution of newtonian gravitational systems .",
    "according to the classic idea of violent relaxation , a collisionless system starting far from dynamical equilibrium reaches such a state via collective oscillations .",
    "if the associated mean field fluctuations persist until the bulk of the system is described by a most probable phase space distribution , the resulting distribution functions are of maxwellian form , which are quite different from the distribution functions of dark matter halos for example ( e.g. , widrow 2000 ) .",
    "the associated density profiles are dominated by isothermal cores ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , which are not observed in elliptical galaxies or in simulated cosmological halos .",
    "in contrast , in the scenario proposed here , violent relaxation should persist only until a system , starting far from equilibrium , finds a configuration where collective oscillations are efficiently damped ; and such configurations support dynamical trajectories that are marginally stable .",
    "this condition necessarily leads to equilibria that are different from isothermal ( except for exact singular isothermal pheres ) , and which are remarkably similar to those observed and modeled , provided that the initial conditions do not impose phase space constraints that disallow evolution to such states .",
    "these systems do not ring and are more robust ; in the sense that , when perturbed , they rapidly return near their initial states , as opposed to configurations dominated by harmonic cores , where small perturbations give rise to significant structural changes accompanied by long - lived collective modes",
    ". there is an intuive explanation of this result ; as opposed to configurations dominated by nearly constant density harmonic cores , these systems display relatively large orbital frequency ranges , and are thus more efficient in damping collective modes .",
    "it is also possible that this is a reason behind the conservation of the universal profiles through major mergers and other processes involving significant potential fluctuations that are important in a cosmological context , though this contention has not been investigated explicitly here .",
    "i would like to thank the referee for comments that lead to significant improvement in substance and presentation ,",
    "replacing @xmath28 and @xmath27 in eq .",
