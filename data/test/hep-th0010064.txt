    "the understanding of confinement and , more generally , of the principles that govern the low energy dynamics in qcd is , perhaps , the most interesting unanswered question in the theory of strong interactions .",
    "the strongly coupled dynamics of the four dimensional non abelian gauge theories has so far proven to be forbiddingly complicated .",
    "a fruitful approach to cope with such situation can be to turn to simpler , more tractable models , that nevertheless capture at least some of the important features of the real theory .    from this point of view , three dimensional non abelian gauge theories are of particular interest since they are , indeed , confining , and have a strong coupling dynamics .",
    "on the other hand they can be continuously deformed into the weak coupling region without encountering any phase transition .",
    "the prototypical case is the @xmath1 gauge theory with an adjoint higgs field - the georgi - glashow model .",
    "these weakly coupled theories are confining , just like their strongly coupled counterparts . here , however , confinement can be studied using semiclassical methods , as first done by polyakov for the @xmath1 case  @xcite , and later on generalized to @xmath2 theories  @xcite .",
    "a related feature of these models is that their spectra has a large gap between the light ( light ` photons ' ) and heavy ( heavy massive gauge bosons ) states .",
    "this makes the identification of the relevant low energy degrees of freedom relatively easy , and also allows one to construct the low energy effective lagrangian explicitly .",
    "it turns out that this effective lagrangian exhibits the confinement phenomenon in a very simple and straightforward way _ on the classical level_. in a nutshell , the natural degrees of freedom turn out to be magnetic vortex fields first introduced by thooft  @xcite , and the confinement mechanism is realized as confinement of topological solitons for those vortex fields .",
    "the structure of the effective lagrangian is robustly determined by the spontaneously broken magnetic @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been motivated by earlier work  @xcite , it was advanced and formulated in  @xcite , and further clarified in  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued in  @xcite , that the same type of effective lagrangian remains valid in the strongly coupled limit of pure gluodynamics .",
    "in this situation , the components of the vortex field are naturally identified with the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs , which according to lattice results are indeed the two lowest states in the spectrum of @xmath3 dimensional gluodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the confinement mechanism for the strongly coupled regime remains , in this picture , essentially the same as for the weakly coupled phase .",
    "all previous work dealt exclusively with theories having no matter fields in fundamental representation .",
    "the purpose of this note is to address the question of what effect dynamical fundamental ` quarks ' have on this low energy structure . that that effect exists and must be nontrivial can be seen from one basic observation : in the presence of fundamental charges , the vortex field ( which is the effective low energy degree of freedom ) is no longer a local field .",
    "the effective lagrangian can not , therefore , be a simple local scalar theory as in  @xcite .",
    "we will show below that , in the presence of fundamental matter , the magnetic @xmath0 in the effective lagrangian is _ gauged _ , the value of the gauge coupling being inversely proportional to the mass of the ( lightest ) dynamical quark .",
    "we will construct such an effective lagrangian , which moreover in the limit of the infinitely heavy quarks reduces to the effective theory of  @xcite .",
    "the presence of fundamental quarks implies the existence of a conserved baryon number charge .",
    "we will see how this charge is represented in the low energy theory , and will study the structure of finite energy baryon states .",
    "quite surprisingly , we find that these states naturally have a bag - like structure .",
    "the value of the vortex field in the region of space which contains the quarks , is much lower than its value in the vacuum .",
    "the potential energy associated with this difference in the expectation values can also be naturally identified with the bag constant .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in section  [ glue ] , we give a lightning review of the results of  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry , its order parameter ( the vortex operator ) , and the structure of the effective lagrangian in pure gluodynamics . in section  [ fund ]",
    "we explain the basic physics of the changes in this structure in the presence of the fundamental charges . in section  [ low ]",
    "we show how to define the relevant low energy degrees of freedom , and how to construct the effective lagrangian in this case . in section  [ baryon ]",
    ", we study the structure of the baryon states .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ discus ] with a short discussion .",
    "consider the pure su(n ) gauge theory in @xmath3 dimensions @xmath4 as was argued by thooft in  @xcite , this theory possesses a global @xmath0 symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the vacuum .",
    "the explicit realization of this symmetry was found in @xcite .",
    "the generator of the @xmath0 group is ( up to a multiplicative constant factor ) the fundamental wilson loop along the spatial boundary of the system @xmath5 in  @xcite , the conservation of @xmath6 was proved taking the pure gluodynamics limit of the georgi - glashow model .",
    "this , however , can also be shown directly by calculating the commutator of @xmath6 with the yang - mills hamiltonian @xmath7 : @xmath8=\\lim_{c\\to\\infty}\\oint_c dx_i { \\rm tr } \\left [ p e_i(x)\\exp\\{i\\oint_{c(x , x ) } dy_ia^i(y)\\ } \\right ] \\to_{c\\to\\infty}0 \\;. \\label{commutator}\\ ] ] here , the integral in the exponential on the right hand side starts and ends at the point of insertion of the electric field .",
    "the vanishing of the commutator follows from the fact that it only involves electric fields at spatial infinity , and in a theory with a finite mass gap those fields should vanish at infinity .",
    "to dispel any doubt about the vanishing of this commutator we note that the situation is completely analogous to the commutator of any ` conserved charge ' which is defined as an integral of a local charge density @xmath9 the commutator of such a charge with a hamiltonian contains also a surface term , since the charge density @xmath10 never commutes with the hamiltonian density but rather gives a total derivative in the commutator . for a conserved charge , due to the continuity equation , this surface term is equal to the circulation of the spatial component of the current @xmath11=i\\oint_c dx^ij_i\\;.\\ ] ] the vanishing of this term again is the consequence of the vanishing of the physical fields at infinity in a theory with a mass gap .",
    "when the charge is not conserved , the commutator contains also a bulk term in addition to the surface contribution .",
    "it is the absence of the bulk terms that is the distinctive property of a conserved charge .",
    "the same conclusion is reached if , rather than considering the generator of the algebra , one considers the commutator of the group element for either continuous or discreet symmetry groups .",
    "we see , therefore , that the commutator in ( [ commutator ] ) indeed tells us that @xmath6 is a conserved operator .",
    "next , a simple argument establishes that the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum if the wilson loop @xmath12 has an area law behaviour  @xcite .",
    "the argument goes like this .",
    "the vev of @xmath12 is the overlap of the vacuum state @xmath13 with the state @xmath14 which is obtained from the vacuum by acting on it with @xmath12 .",
    "when acting on the vacuum state , @xmath12 performs the @xmath0 transformation at all points within the area @xmath15 bounded by the loop .",
    "if the vacuum wavefunction depends on the configuration of the @xmath0 non invariant degrees of freedom ( the state in question is not @xmath0 invariant ) the action of @xmath12 affects the state everywhere inside the loop . in the local theory with finite correlation length",
    "the overlap between the two states approximately factorizes into the product of the overlaps taken over the region of space of linear dimension of order of the correlation length @xmath16 @xmath17 where the label @xmath18 is the coordinate of the point in the center of a given small region of space . for @xmath18 outside the area @xmath15",
    "the two states @xmath19 and @xmath20 are identical and therefore the overlap is unity .",
    "however for @xmath18 inside @xmath15 the states are different and the overlap is therefore some number @xmath21 smaller than unity .",
    "the number of such regions inside the area is obviously of order @xmath22 and thus @xmath23 the vev of @xmath12 then falls off as an area .",
    "conversely , if the vacuum is @xmath0 invariant , the wavefunction does not depend on the configuration of the non invariant degrees of freedom .",
    "the action of @xmath12 then alters the state only along the perimeter and @xmath12 has the perimeter law behaviour in the unbroken phase .",
    "thus the area law behaviour of the fundamental wilson loop is tantamount to the breaking of the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry in the vacuum of pure gluodynamics .",
    "the only requirement that this argument presupposes is the existence of * local * degrees of freedom which are non invariant under @xmath0 , or in other words the existence of a * local * order parameter .",
    "such an operator can indeed be constructed explicitly .",
    "this is the magnetic vortex creation operator @xmath24  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the defining property of @xmath24 is that it satisfies the following commutation relation with the spatial fundamental wilson loop @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the linking number of the curve @xmath28 and the point @xmath18 , or in other words , @xmath29 if @xmath30 , and @xmath31 if @xmath32 , where @xmath15 is the region of the plane bounded by @xmath28 . an explicit representation for @xmath33",
    "is given by writing it as the operator that performs a ` singular gauge transformation ' @xmath34 here , the hypercharge generator @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 the electric field is written in the matrix notation @xmath37 , with @xmath38 denoting the @xmath2 generator matrices in the fundamental representation , and @xmath39 is the hypercharge density due to gluons @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath41 is the planar angle of the vector @xmath18 . using gauss law @xmath42 this operator ( on the states that satisfy gauss law )",
    "may be written in an alternative representation @xmath43 the integration here is along the branch cut in the definition of the planar angle @xmath44 , which is an infinite line that starts at the point @xmath18 and goes to infinity .",
    "there are two crucial properties of the definition eq.([v2 ] ) that insure that the operator @xmath24 is a local physical field :    1",
    ".   gauge invariance .",
    "the definition is not explicitly gauge invariant .",
    "nevertheless , one can show  @xcite,@xcite that @xmath24 transforms a physical state into another physical state .",
    "that is to say that the matrix elements of @xmath24 between a physical and an unphysical state vanish . by physical state we mean a state which satisfies the non abelian gauss law . by virtue of this property the definition eq.([v2",
    "] ) can be used as long as the matrix elements of @xmath24 ( or any power of @xmath24 with insertions of an arbitrary number of gauge invariant operators ) are calculated between physical states .",
    "2 .   locality .",
    "again , the definition is not explicitly local , since it contains the integral of the electric field along an infinite line .",
    "however in a theory that does not contain fundamental charges , @xmath24 in fact does not depend on the curve @xmath28 , but only on its endpoint @xmath18 .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that the bohm - aharonov phase between @xmath24 and any charged state in the theory vanishes .",
    "more formally , consider changing the position of the curve @xmath28 to @xmath45 .",
    "this adds to the phase in the definition eq.([v2 ] ) a contribution @xmath46 , where @xmath15 is the area bounded by @xmath47 . in our normalization ,",
    "the hypercharge of gluons is @xmath48 or @xmath49 and no particles with smaller value of the hypercharge are present in the theory .",
    "therefore the hypercharge within any closed area is an integer multiple of the gauge coupling @xmath50 , and the extra phase factor is always unity .",
    "one can also show directly  @xcite , using canonical commutation relations , that @xmath33 commutes with all the local gauge invariant operators @xmath51 , unless @xmath52 , which formally establishes the locality of @xmath24 .",
    "the universal properties of the low energy dynamics of the pure yang mills theory are determined by the spontaneous breaking of the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the effective low energy lagrangian is constructed in terms of the vortex field @xmath24 in principle we have to include in this lagrangian higher order potential terms which stabilize the potential energy at large values of @xmath24 .",
    "although we will not indicate them explicitly , it is assumed in the following that they are indeed present whenever necessary . ]",
    "@xmath53 this lagrangian can be derived in a controllable way in the weakly coupled phase@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the coupling constants in eq.([ldualgg ] ) are determined in the weakly coupled region from perturbation theory and dilute monopole gas approximation .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the same low energy lagrangian is also valid in the strongly coupled regime ( pure gluodynamics ) .",
    "several features of this lagrangian are worth noting :    * first , @xmath54 , and therefore the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken . *",
    "second , the field components of @xmath24 can be reinterpreted in terms of the physical glueball fields . using a polar decomposition for @xmath24 @xmath55",
    "we find that the fluctuation field @xmath10 is the charge conjugation even scalar , while the phase @xmath56 is the conjugation odd pseudoscalar . indeed , according to lattice results  @xcite , the two lightest glueballs in the spectrum of pure gluodynamics are the scalar @xmath57 and pseudoscalar @xmath58 states .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ ldualgg ] ) , is thus the natural effective lagrangian that one would write to describe the dynamics of the lightest particles . in this respect",
    "the identification of the glueball fields with the modulus and the phase of @xmath24 constrains the possible terms in the effective lagrangian by imposing the @xmath0 symmetry on possible interaction terms .",
    "* finally , this effective lagrangian exhibits in a simple way confining properties of the theory .",
    "the colour charged ` gluon ' states ( or massive vector bosons in the weakly coupled regime ) are represented in the low energy theory by topological solitons carrying unit winding of the field @xmath24 . if not for the @xmath59 symmetry breaking term in the potential in ( [ ldualgg ] )",
    ", the lowest lying state in the topologically nontrivial sector would have a rotationally invariant hedgehog - like structure .",
    "its energy would be logarithmically divergent in the infrared , which corresponds to the logarithmic coulomb potential in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "however since the symmetry of the potential is @xmath0 rather than @xmath59 , the energy of the hedgehog configuration diverges quadratically with the volume .",
    "this is so since the number of vacuum states is discreet and in the hedgehog configuration the phase of the field @xmath24 is far from its vacuum value everywhere in space .",
    "the configuration that actually minimizes the energy in the one soliton sector breaks rotational invariance by confining the winding of the phase of @xmath24 to some quasi one - dimensional strip , like in figure 1 .",
    "it is clear that , dynamically , the width of this strip is of the order of the inverse glueball mass and the strip itself is nothing but the confining electric flux string .",
    "the energy of such an isolated soliton now diverges _ linearly _ in the infrared , due to the finite energy density per unit length of the string .",
    "[ fig1 ]   in the state of unit charge in the presence of the symmetry breaking terms in the effective lagrangian , for the @xmath60 model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the soliton we are discussing is a dynamical particle in the effective theory - it thus represents a particle with an adjoint color charge , and the string is the adjoint string .",
    "this string is of course not absolutely stable since it can break into a soliton - antisoliton pair when it is too long .",
    "the fundamental string also appears naturally in the low energy description .",
    "it is the stable domain wall which separates the regions of space with different expectation values of the vortex field @xmath24 @xcite , see figure 2 .",
    "in this section we wish to discuss the modifications introduced by the presence of fundamental quarks in the structure just described . for simplicity",
    "we will consider scalar quarks .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory we are interested in is @xmath61 where the scalar field @xmath62 transforms according to the fundamental representation of the @xmath2 color group .",
    "first thing to note is that the fundamental wilson loop still commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "this is obvious , since the extra terms in the hamiltonian in the presence of the quarks do not involve electric field operator , but only vector potential .",
    "the wilson loop commutes with the vector potential , and thus with the additional terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we thus conclude that the theory still has the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this may seem somewhat surprising at first sight .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that spontaneous breaking of the magnetic @xmath0 implies the area law for the wilson loop , and conversely the perimeter law of @xmath25 implies unbroken @xmath0 . in the theory with fundamental charges",
    "the wilson loop is known to have perimeter law due to breaking of the confining string at any finite value of the fundamental mass @xmath63 .",
    "we might then conclude that the magnetic @xmath0 is restored at any , arbitrarily large value of @xmath63 but is broken at @xmath64 .",
    "the common lore is that the @xmath0 breaking phase transition for @xmath65 is first order , and this then implies a discontinuous behaviour of the theory in the infinite mass limit .",
    "this of course is completely counterintuitive and in fact plain wrong .",
    "the caveat in this line of reasoning is the following .",
    "the relation between the behaviour of the wilson loop and the mode of the realization of the magnetic symmetry hinges crucially on the existence of a local order parameter of the magnetic @xmath0 . in the absence of such an order parameter",
    "it is not true that the wilson loop locally changes the quantum state inside the loop and this invalidates the whole argument .",
    "in particular in the absence of a local order parameter , the @xmath0 symmetry can be spontaneously broken but the wilson loop can have a perimeter law .    in fact it is easy to see that for any finite @xmath63 the magnetic @xmath0 does not have a local order parameter .",
    "the only candidate for such an order parameter is the vortex operator @xmath33 defined in eq.([v2 ] ) , since it has to be local also relative to the purely gluonic operators by any explicitly local gauge invariant operator .",
    "such modifications are however irrelevant as far as the locality properties of @xmath24 are concerned , and we will not consider them in the following . ] .",
    "however in the presence of fundamental quarks the operator @xmath33 is not local anymore . to see this",
    "consider the dependence of @xmath66 on the curve @xmath28 which enters its definition .",
    "as before the operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 are related by @xmath69 where @xmath15 is the area bounded by @xmath47 .",
    "as before , due to the gauss law the integral in the exponential is equal to the total hypercharge in the area @xmath15 .",
    "however the hypercharge of fundamental quarks has eigenvalues @xmath70 .",
    "the extra phase factor is therefore not unity anymore but can rather take values @xmath71 depending on the state and the choice of the contour @xmath28 .",
    "the status of the magnetic @xmath0 is thus quite different in a theory with fundamental quarks - it does not have a local order parameter .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that at least as long as the mass @xmath63 is large @xmath72 , the relevant degrees of freedom for the effective infrared dynamics should still be the vortices @xmath24 and the main factor which determines their dynamics should still be the magnetic @xmath0 . at large @xmath63",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 on the curve @xmath28 is weak , since the probability of the vacuum fluctuations which involve fundamental charges is small .",
    "the probability of appearance of a virtual @xmath73 pair separated by a distance @xmath16 is suppressed by the exponential factor @xmath74 .",
    "the typical distance scale for the `` glueball '' physics is @xmath75 .",
    "thus at these distances such fluctuations are unimportant and should not affect much the dynamics .",
    "things are different however if one is interested also in the baryonic sector of the theory .",
    "the baryons are necessarily heavy and in order to be able to discuss their structure we must understand the main dynamical effects also at shorter distances .",
    "therefore our aim now is to understand what is the main effect of the non locality discussed above on the dynamics of magnetic vortices .",
    "the situation we have just described - a symmetry without a local order parameter - is not exceptional in quantum field theory .",
    "this is precisely the property of the global part of any abelian gauge group .",
    "consider for example quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the global electric charge is of course a physical gauge invariant charge with the corresponding gauge invariant local charge density .",
    "@xmath76 nevertheless there is no local operator that carries this charge .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the gauss law @xmath77 any physical , gauge invariant operator that carries @xmath78 must also carry the long range electric field , which can not fall off faster than a power of the distance .",
    "the gauge invariant qed lagrangian is written in terms of `` local '' charged fields @xmath79 .",
    "but appearances are deceptive : these fields are not gauge invariant , and therefore not physical .",
    "a gauge invariant charged field can be constructed from @xmath79 by multiplying it by a phase factor @xmath80 with the @xmath81-number field @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 for any @xmath82 satisfying this condition the operator @xmath84 is gauge invariant , and therefore physical .",
    "it is however necessarily nonlocal .",
    "different choices of @xmath82 define different gauge invariant operators and correspond to different gauge fixings .",
    "thus for @xmath85 the field @xmath84 is the field @xmath79 in the coulomb gauge , while @xmath86 corresponds to the axial gauge @xmath87 , and so on .",
    "different definitions of @xmath84 differ from each other by a phase factor , which is precisely the gauge ambiguity of the original field @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath59 gauge group is the most natural abelian gauge symmetry to consider in continuum field theory .",
    "one can however also consider discrete groups like @xmath0@xcite . in this case again no local operator that carries the global @xmath0 charge exists .",
    "the various gauge invariant charged operators are nonlocal and differ from each other by a local @xmath0 - valued phase .",
    "these different operators again correspond to different gauge fixings of the local @xmath0 group .",
    "this is precisely the structure that emerged in our discussion in the earlier part of this section .",
    "we have    \\1 . global magnetic @xmath0 symmetry generated by the fundamental wilson loop .",
    "the set of nonlocal vortex operators @xmath66 , which all carry the @xmath0 charge and differ from each other by a @xmath0 valued phase factors .",
    "it is very suggestive therefore to think about @xmath66 as of different gauge fixed versions of a field charged under local @xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to expect that the low energy theory we are after should be a @xmath0 gauge theory of the magnetic vortex field @xmath24 .",
    "in fact coming back to the discussion in the beginning of this section , we see that from this vantage point it is obvious why the wilson loop has a perimeter law , even if the global @xmath0 is broken spontaneously .",
    "the action of a wilson loop of a finite size inside the contour is a gauge transformation .",
    "thus in physical terms locally inside the contour the new state is _ the same _ as the old one and so the overlap between the two locally is unity .",
    "the only nontrivial contributions to the overlap come from the region close to the contour , thus giving the perimeter law .    in the next section",
    "we shall construct the effective gauge theory and discuss its relation to the original qcd lagrangian .",
    "although it is possible to give a more ` analytic ' derivation of the effective lagrangian , we prefer to write it down directly guided by the previous discussion .",
    "we will then explain the physical meaning of the various fields that appear in it .",
    "the easiest way to construct a @xmath0 gauge theory in the continuum is to consider a @xmath59 gauge theory with the higgs field of charge @xmath88 which has a large expectation value  @xcite .",
    "consider therefore the following lagrangian : @xmath89 here @xmath90 .",
    "we take the parameters such that , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the ` higgs ' field @xmath93 has a large expectation value and breaks the @xmath59 gauge symmetry down to its @xmath0 subgroup @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that this gauge subgroup does not correspond to ` singular ' gauge transformations , since partial derivatives commute on the gauge parameter , despite the fact that there are @xmath95-like singularities .    below the scale determined by the expectation value @xmath96 ,",
    "the field @xmath93 is practically frozen and its fluctuations are unimportant",
    ". in this regime the model indeed describes the locally @xmath0 invariant theory . the global part of the gauge group is our @xmath0 magnetic symmetry generated by the wilson loop .",
    "the larger @xmath59 gauge structure at this point is just an auxiliary trick which enables us to write down a discrete gauge theory in continuous notations .",
    "we will however see later that it does in fact has a real physical meaning of its own and arises naturally in the effective theory .",
    "let us first discuss how this lagrangian reduces to the effective lagrangian of the pure yang - mills theory eq.([ldualgg ] ) in the limit of the large quark mass . in this limit",
    "not only the field @xmath93 must decouple , but also the gauge interactions of the field @xmath24 must vanish . there is another consistency requirement . in the limit of zero gauge coupling",
    "@xmath97 the gauge @xmath59 symmetry becomes global @xmath59 and is broken due to non vanishing expectation value of @xmath93 .",
    "the spectrum therefore contains a massless goldstone boson .",
    "this goldstone boson is of course the longitudinal component of the gauge field @xmath98 .",
    "there is however no such massless particle in the pure gluodynamics nor in the effective lagrangian eq.([ldualgg ] ) .",
    "this means that the couplings in eq.([efflfund ] ) should depend on the quark mass in such a way that the vector particles remains heavy for any finite @xmath63 and its mass goes to zero very sharply only in the limit when it is completely decoupled . in terms of the goldstone boson",
    "couplings it means that @xmath99 must be larger than any scale relevant to the dynamics of the vortex field @xmath24 .",
    "all these conditions can be met by choosing for example @xmath100 with this choice the mass of the vector boson @xmath101 stays finite as @xmath102 and can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the goldstone boson in the decoupling limit has an infinite @xmath99 and is completely decoupled just as the `` invisible axion '' .",
    "we now want to understand how the basic fields present in the effective lagrangian arise in the fundamental theory eq.([lqcd ] ) .",
    "we start with considering the symmetries .",
    "the lagrangian eq.([efflfund ] ) has two global @xmath59 symmetries .",
    "one is the global part of the local @xmath59 with the conserved current @xmath103 .",
    "note that due to the direct coupling between the @xmath24 and @xmath93 fields the @xmath59 rotations of @xmath24 and @xmath93 separately are not symmetries .",
    "the other current , conserved by virtue of the homogeneous maxwell equation is @xmath104 .",
    "the two charges have quite different nature .",
    "the second one , the dual magnetic flux @xmath105 has a local order parameter",
    ". it can be constructed in a way similar to the vortex field in qed @xcite,@xcite . the global @xmath59 gauge charge ,",
    "on the other hand does not have a local order parameter , as discussed earlier .",
    "both these conserved currents should also exist in the fundamental theory .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to identify them .",
    "the qcd lagrangian has one obvious global @xmath59 charge - the baryon number .",
    "this charge has local order parameters - gauge invariant baryon fields of qcd , and is therefore identified with the dual magnetic flux @xmath106    the second charge can be expressed in terms of the spatial current components of the first one @xmath107 \\label{qt}\\ ] ] it is thus the vorticity associated with the baryon number current .",
    "the vortex operator @xmath24 which appears in eq.([efflfund ] ) is not gauge invariant and is only physical after complete gauge fixing of the @xmath59 gauge group .",
    "after such a gauge fixing ( which amounts to multiplying @xmath24 by an operator valued phase ) the gauss law requires that on the physical states the physical operator @xmath24 carry the charge @xmath108 . due to the identification eqs.([f],[qt ] ) this leads to a surprising conclusion that any physical operator @xmath24 in the effective theory creates a vortex of the original baryon number current .",
    "this somewhat unexpected conclusion is in fact quite natural for an eigenoperator of the magnetic @xmath0 . consider the vortex operator @xmath24 defined by eq.([v2 ] ) .",
    "in qcd just like in pure gluodynamics , it has an alternative representation of an operator of the singular gauge transformation of the form eq.([v1 ] ) @xmath109 the only difference is that now @xmath110 is the hypercharge operator due to both , gluons and fundamental quarks @xmath111+y_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\phi^*_\\alpha\\pi_\\beta- \\phi_\\alpha\\pi^*_\\beta)\\big]\\ ] ] consider the action of this operator on a quark field @xmath112 .",

    "it is natural to define the local vorticity associated with the baryon number as the vorticity defined in this way is precisely the circulation of the phase of @xmath112 . ]",
    "@xmath119 \\label{vort}\\ ] ] the vortex operator @xmath24 therefore creates a vortex of baryon number current with fractional vorticity @xmath116 @xmath120    the operator @xmath93 due to the gauss law also carries baryon vorticity . since its gauge coupling is @xmath88 times the coupling of @xmath24 , it creates one unit of vorticity .    in fact",
    "this simple exercise also helps us to identify the value of the gauge coupling constant @xmath121 in the effective theory . comparing eq.([vort ] ) with eq.([qt ] ) we find @xmath122 the same relation is obtained by comparing the current algebra in the fundamental and the effective theories .",

    "the operator on the right hand side of this equation in the effective theory is indeed a constant .",
    "recall , that our effective theory should be valid at long distances . in this regime in the leading order in the derivative expansion the operator @xmath124 should be approximated by its expectation value .",
    "taking into account fluctuations of @xmath124 is tantamount to including higher derivative terms in the effective lagrangian eq.([efflfund ] ) .",
    "at this , higher order in derivative expansion the gauge coupling constant would become a dynamical field . while this is perfectly legitimate ,",
    "it is certainly beyond our present framework .",
    "when taking the expectation value of @xmath124 we should remember that it has to be calculated with the cutoff @xmath125 appropriate for the effective theory .",
    "this cutoff must be above the characteristic scale of the pure gluodynamics ( determined by the string tension ) but below the heavy quark mass . with this in mind",
    "we get @xmath126 so that finally @xmath127 which is consistent with the expected scaling in the large mass limit eq.([largem ] ) .",
    "having understood the origin of the fields and the symmetries in the effective theory , we would like to see how it encodes the qualitative features of the low energy qcd physics . since we are considering a heavy quark theory , below the fundamental mass scale the spectrum should be the same as in pure gluodynamics .",
    "we have already seen that , in the infinite mass limit , the effective theory reduces to that of ( [ ldualgg ] ) .",
    "indeed , even at finite but large @xmath63 , this is the case at low energies .",
    "formally , this can be seen as follows .",
    "since the vev of the field @xmath93 is large , we can impose the unitary gauge condition on it . in this unitary gauge the phase of @xmath93 disappears .",
    "the modulus of @xmath93 is very heavy , and so is the vector field @xmath98 .",
    "thus at low energies we recover the effective theory of pure glue sector .",
    "there is however a set of configurations , on which the unitary gauge can not be imposed .",
    "those are configurations in which @xmath93 vanishes at some points in space .",
    "indeed it is these configurations that are important for the baryonic sector .",
    "recall that @xmath93 is a vortex of baryon number current .",
    "thus one expects that the baryon charge is associated with the vortex configuration of the field @xmath93 . in the core of the vortex",
    "the field @xmath93 of course has to vanish , and so the unitary gauge is not admissible .",
    "thus in the baryon sector we can not think of @xmath93 as frozen at its expectation value and instead have to treat it as a dynamical field .    that the baryon does indeed carry vorticity of the field @xmath93 ,",
    "can be seen by the following simple argument .",
    "the baryon number is represented in the effective theory by the dual magnetic flux",
    ". the baryonic state must therefore be the dual magnetic vortex .",
    "such a vortex in a nonsingular gauge has a vector potential of the form @xmath128 . to have a finite energy",
    "it must be accompanied by the winding of the phases of both @xmath24 and @xmath93 .",
    "in fact since @xmath93 carries @xmath88 times the charge of @xmath24 , the only states that are allowed energetically are those that carry @xmath88 vortices of @xmath93 .",
    "this is natural in view of the ` dual ' relation between the effective and the fundamental theories .",
    "the field @xmath93 is the ` vortex ' dual to the fundamental quark .",
    "we thus expect that its elementary vortex would represent the fundamental quark itself , and so finite energy states must contain @xmath88 such elementary vortices .",
    "a single vortex must be confined . in the same sense , @xmath24 is ` dual ' to the adjoint gluon field .",
    "the elementary vortex of @xmath24 is then , in a sense , the ` constituent ' gluon .",
    "in fact , such single gluon should not exist as a finite energy state either , and we expect it also to be confined .",
    "the single vortex of @xmath24 should therefore bind either with the anti - vortex of the same type , or with @xmath88 vortices of @xmath93 .",
    "the former type of state is a glueball , and exists in the pure glue theory  @xcite , while the latter type is a baryon .",
    "interestingly enough , this line of reasoning leads us to expect that the baryon must have a bag - like structure .",
    "namely , the quarks are bound to the @xmath24 field vortex . inside this vortex , the value of @xmath24 is small - in fact it exactly vanishes in the middle , and than rises quite slowly ( relative to the scale of @xmath129 ) towards the edges . recall that @xmath130 corresponds to a non confining state  @xcite .",
    "the quarks are therefore sitting in the ` perturbative ' region of space - where there are no confining forces .",
    "only when they separate far from each other - into the region with non vanishing @xmath24 , the linear potential pulls them inside again .",
    "let us look at this more carefully .",
    "consider for simplicity the @xmath60 symmetric case @xmath131 .",
    "the baryon is the dual vortex with dual magnetic flux @xmath132 .",
    "far from the vortex core , the field configuration is pure gauge , with the phases of @xmath24 and @xmath93 following the vector potential : @xmath133 the parameters of the model are such that the field @xmath24 is much lighter than both @xmath93 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus the size of the vortex core of @xmath24 is large - of the order of the inverse glueball mass .",
    "the two @xmath93-vortices which have a very small size core , sit inside this core .",
    "since the length associated with the dual magnetic field is much smaller than the core size of the @xmath24 - vortex , the dual flux is concentrated on the @xmath93 - vortices . from the low energy point of view",
    ", the picture is that two point - like magnetic vortices sit inside a soft core of a @xmath24 field vortex .",
    "the field configuration looks roughly as depicted on figure 3 .",
    "the magnetic flux is concentrated in the points @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the phase of the field @xmath93 follows the variation of the vector potential very closely .",
    "the phase of @xmath24 is also trying to do that , but it can not quite follow it all the way , since on the line between the two vortices it would have to be discontinuous . the most important energy contribution ( apart form the core energy of small vortices ) comes therefore from the vicinity of this line .",
    "the phase of @xmath24 obviously has to interpolate across this line between the values @xmath48 and @xmath137 .",
    "since the modulus of @xmath24 is not extremely rigid , it will be smaller along this line than in the immediate neighborhood .",
    "both , the variation of the modulus and the phase of @xmath24 along the line connecting the small vortices contribute to the energy which is clearly linear in the distance @xmath138 .    [ fig3 ] .",
    "arrows represent the direction ( phase ) of @xmath24 , and the big dots at @xmath135 and @xmath136 correspond to the positions of the @xmath93 field vortices.,title=\"fig : \" ]      to study the structure of the baryon more quantitatively let us fix the gauge such that @xmath139\\ ] ] @xmath140 this is a valid gauge choice for the configuration with two vortices of unit winding at the positions @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "due to the conditions on the parameters of our model , the vector field @xmath98 follows the phase of @xmath93 in the whole space .",
    "thus @xmath143\\ ] ] where : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath16 , @xmath146 are the positions of the left and right vortices , respectively : @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "there are two interesting limiting situations .",
    "the first is when the distance @xmath149 is larger than the dynamical distance scales @xmath150 and @xmath151 which determine the masses of the glueballs .",
    "the second interesting situation is the reverse , that is when the two vortices are sitting well inside the glueball correlation length .",
    "let us look at them in turn .",
    "when the distance between the vortices is large we expect the potential between them to be linear with the string tension calculated in the theory without the dynamical @xmath93 field .",
    "we will study the interquark potential in our low energy theory in the semiclassical approximation .    to find the minimal energy configuration",
    ", we have to solve the classical equations of motion for the field @xmath24 at a fixed configuration of @xmath93 and @xmath134 given by eqs.([eq : uconf],[eq : bconf ] ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the points which are close to the @xmath18 - axis , with @xmath152 .",
    "the main contribution to the energy comes from this region of space . in this region",
    "the vector potential @xmath134 vanishes , and the phase of the field @xmath93 is zero .",
    "thus the equations of motion for the field @xmath24 are the same as in the pure gluodynamics .",
    "also as long as we stick to this region , the configuration of @xmath24 is translationally invariant in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "what determines the energy then are the boundary conditions on the field @xmath24 . in this configuration clearly",
    "the phase of the field @xmath24 is @xmath153 far above the @xmath18 axis and @xmath154 far below the axis , fig.3 .",
    "thus both , the equations and the boundary conditions are precisely the same as for the domain wall separating the two degenerate vacua in the effective theory of pure gluodynamics ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "there is an extra contribution to the energy that comes from the region of space close to the points @xmath135 and @xmath136 . but",
    "this energy does not depend on @xmath149 and is subleading for large @xmath149 .",
    "the rest of the space does not contribute to the energy , since the field configuration there is pure gauge .",
    "thus as expected the energy in this regime is @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the domain wall tension ( fundamental string tension ) calculated in pure gluodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps more interesting to consider the opposite situation , that is when the distance between the quarks is smaller than the glueball correlation length .",
    "this is the regime in which we do not expect to see any stringy structure .",
    "instead we can ask whether the lowest energy configuration has any resemblance to a bag . to study this question we take the limit @xmath158 . in this case clearly the phase of the field @xmath24 will follow the phase of @xmath93 in the whole space @xmath159 given this condition , only the variation of the radial component of @xmath24 has to be determined .",
    "since the problem has rotational symmetry , the equation of motion for the modulus @xmath10 becomes @xmath160 with @xmath161 , which is assumed to be positive throughout this paper .",
    "the relevant boundary condition in this case is that at infinity @xmath10 approaches its vacuum value @xmath162 while in the vortex core it vanishes @xmath163 . with these boundary conditions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqrho1 ] ) has the familiar form of the @xmath164 static kink equation in @xmath165 dimensions with the solution @xmath166 the energy of this solution is @xmath167_{a=0 } \\;=\\ ; \\lambda \\int_0^\\infty \\ , 2 \\pi dr r \\ , ( v^4 - \\rho^4 ) \\;=\\ ; \\frac{\\pi^3}{12 } \\ , \\frac{\\eta}{\\lambda } \\;=\\ ; \\frac{\\pi^3}{12 } \\ , ( \\mu^2 - \\frac{\\xi u}{\\lambda } ) \\;.\\ ] ]    the picture is thus just as described in the previous subsection .",
    "since the two quark state is accompanied by the vortex of the field @xmath24 , the quarks effectively ` dig a hole ' in the vacuum . in their immediate vicinity",
    "the modulus @xmath10 vanishes , and therefore there is a ` bag ' of the nonconfining state .",
    "the radius of this bag is given by the mass of the scalar glueball @xmath168 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although for large separation @xmath149 the energy of the string gets contributions from both , the scalar and the pseudoscalar glueballs ( the modulus and the phase of @xmath24 ) , the ` bag constant ' is determined solely by the scalar glueball . for small @xmath149 the phase of @xmath24 is not excited and only @xmath10 deviates from the vacuum state inside the ` bag ' .",
    "this is consistent with the common lore that the inside of the bag is distinguished from the outside by the value of the @xmath169 condensate .",
    "in fact since @xmath10 has vacuum quantum numbers and interpolates in our effective theory the scalar glueball , it is naturally associated with the operator @xmath169 which has a large overlap with the scalar glueball in qcd .",
    "in this note we have considered the effect of heavy fundamental quarks on the effective low energy theory description of nonabelian gauge theories in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we found that the status of the magnetic @xmath0 symmetry changes .",
    "it becomes a local symmetry with the ` gauge coupling ' inversely proportional to the quark mass .",
    "thus the low energy theory becomes a discrete gauge theory .",
    "we have also studied the structure of the baryon in the framework of the effective theory .",
    "the picture that emerges is very reminiscent to the ` bag ' .",
    "the quarks in the baryon sit in the middle of the @xmath24-vortex , where the energy density differs from the vacuum energy density .",
    "the ` bag constant ' is equal to the difference of these two energy densities , and parametrically in the effective theory is given by @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the mass of the scalar glueball and @xmath172 is the expectation value of the vortex radial field @xmath10 .",
    "an important thing to note is that the bag we are talking about here arises in a very different situation than in the usual bag model  @xcite .",
    "there the bag describes the structure of the baryon containing _ light _ quarks .",
    "the radius of the bag in this situation is determined by the balance of the vacuum pressure and the pressure due to the free motion of the light quarks inside , and in fact depends on the quark wave function . in our case",
    "the inside of the bag contains heavy quarks .",
    "their kinetic energy is small , and we have treated them here as static .",
    "the radius of the bag thus is determined purely by the dynamics of the scalar glueball field and is not sensitive to the state of the heavy quarks .",
    "this is true for low lying excitations for which the radius of the quark state is smaller than the inverse glueball mass .",
    "when these two scales are comparable presumably the quark pressure will also be important and will play a role in the energy balance . thus in this intermediate regime we expect the @xmath24-vortex to be similar to the bag in the usual bag model . for states of even larger size",
    "the potential between quarks is linear with the fundamental string tension .",
    "the bag picture should therefore go smoothly into the string picture",
    ". it would be interesting to study these questions further in the framework of the effective theory discussed in this note .",
    "lastly we note that although we have so far considered scalar quarks , extending this discussion to spin @xmath173 quarks is fairly straightforward .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in the abelian higgs model the spin of the vortex is controlled by the coefficient of the chern - simons term of the vector field . thus adding the chern simons term for the vector field @xmath98 @xmath174 with @xmath175 , will endow the vortex of the @xmath93-field with a half integer spin - vortex and not the @xmath24-vortex , since in the dynamics of our effective model the vector potential @xmath98 follows the phase of the field @xmath93 . ] .",
    "our effective model with this extra term is relevant to the description of qcd with one flavour of heavy spinor quarks . just like the fermion mass term in 2 + 1 dimensions , the chern simons term breaks the parity symmetry in the baryonic sector of the theory .",
    "the extra term does not affect the classical analysis we have preformed here , but is clearly relevant for determination of the spin of the baryon as well as the spectrum of the excitations .",
