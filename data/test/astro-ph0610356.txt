    "massive stars dominate the feedback to the local interstellar medium ( ism ) in star - forming galaxies via their stellar winds and ultimate death as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "in particular , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars typically have wind densities an order of magnitude higher than massive o stars .",
    "they contribute to the chemical enrichment of galaxies , they are the prime candidates for the immediate progenitors of long , soft gamma ray bursts ( grbs , woosley & bloom 2006 ) , and they provide a signature of high - mass star formation in galaxies ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , wr stars are spectacular in appearance , with strong , broad emission lines instead of the narrow absorption lines which are typical of normal stellar populations ( e.g. beals 1940 ) .",
    "the class are named after wolf & rayet ( 1867 ) who identified three stars in cygnus with such broad emission lines .",
    "it was immediately apparent that their spectra came in two flavours , subsequently identified as those with strong lines of helium and nitrogen ( wn subtypes ) and those with strong helium , carbon , and oxygen ( wc and wo subtypes ) .",
    "gamov ( 1943 ) first suggested that the anomalous composition of wr stars was the result of nuclear processed material being visible on their surfaces , although this was not universally established until the final decade of the 20th century ( lamers et al .",
    "1991 ) . specifically , wn and wc stars show the products of the cno cycle ( h - burning ) and the triple-@xmath2 ( he - burning ) , respectively",
    ". in reality",
    ", there is a continuity of physical and chemical properties between o supergiants and wn subtypes .",
    "typically , wr stars have masses of 1025 @xmath1 , and are descended from o - type stars .",
    "they spend @xmath010% of their @xmath05myr lifetime as wr stars ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) . at solar metallicity the minimum initial mass for a star to become a wr star is @xmath025 @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds closely to the humphreys & davidson ( 1979 ) limit for red supergiants ( rsg ) , according to a comparison between the current temperature calibration of rsg and stellar models that allow for mass - loss and rotation ( e.g. levesque et al . 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , some single wr stars are post - red supergiants within a fairly limited mass range of probably 2530@xmath1 .",
    "evolution proceeds via an intermediate luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase above 30@xmath1 . for close binaries ,",
    "the critical mass for production of a wr star has no such robust lower limit , since roche lobe overflow or common envelope evolution could produce a wr star instead of an extended rsg phase .",
    "the strong , broad emission lines seen in spectra of wr stars are due to their powerful stellar winds .",
    "the wind is sufficiently dense that an optical depth of unity in the continuum arises in the outflowing material .",
    "the spectral features are formed far out in the wind and are seen primarily in emission .",
    "the line and continuum formation regions are geometrically extended compared to the stellar radii and their physical depths are highly wavelength dependent .",
    "the unique spectroscopic signature of wr stars has permitted their detection individually in local group galaxies ( e.g. massey & johnson 1998 ; massey 2003 ) , collectively within knots of local star forming galaxies ( e.g. hadfield & crowther 2006 ) , and as significant contributors to the average rest - frame uv spectrum of lyman break galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the present review focuses on observational properties of classical wolf - rayet stars in the milky way and beyond , plus physical and chemical properties determined from spectroscopic analysis , plus comparisons with interior evolutionary models , and provides revisions to the topic with respect to the excellent abbott & conti ( 1987 ) review .",
    "low mass ( @xmath3 ) central stars of planetary nebulae displaying a wolf - rayet spectroscopic appearance ( denoted [ wr ] ) are not considered .",
    "nevertheless , analysis tools discussed here are common to both types of star ( e.g. crowther et al .",
    "visual spectral classification of wr stars is based on emission line strengths and line ratios following smith ( 1968a ) .",
    "wn spectral subtypes follow a scheme involving line ratios of niii - v and hei - ii , ranging from wn2 to wn5 for ` early wn ' ( wne ) stars , and wn7 to wn9 for ` late wn ' ( wnl ) stars , with wn6 stars either early or late - type .",
    "a h suffix may be used to indicate the presence of emission lines due to hydrogen ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ) .",
    "complications arise for wn stars with intrinsically weak emission lines .",
    "for example , wr24 ( wn6 ha ) has a heii @xmath44686 emission equivalent width that is an order of magnitude smaller than those in some other wn6 stars ; the ` ha ' nomenclature indicates that hydrogen is seen both in absorption and emission . from a standard spectroscopic viewpoint , such stars possess mid to late wn spectral classifications .",
    "however , their appearance is rather more reminiscent of of stars than classic wn stars , since there exists a continuity of properties between normal o stars and late - type wn stars .",
    "these stars are widely believed to be massive o stars with relatively strong stellar winds at a rather early evolutionary stage .",
    "they are believed not to represent the more mature , classic he - burning wn stars .",
    "smith , crowther & prinja ( 1994 ) extended the wn sequence to very late wn1011 subtypes in order to include a group of emission line stars originally classified as ofpe / wn9 ( bohannan & walborn 1989 ) .",
    "wn11 subtypes closely resemble extreme early - type b supergiants except for the presence of heii @xmath44686 emission .",
    "a quantitative comparison of optical line strengths in of and wnl stars is presented in figure 8 of bohannan & crowther ( 1999 ) .",
    "r127 ( wn11 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) was later identified as a lbv ( stahl et al .",
    "1983 ) , whilst a famous galactic lbv , ag car exhibited a wn11-type spectrum at visual minimum ( walborn 1990 ; smith et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "various multi - dimensional classification systems have been proposed for wn stars ; they generally involve line strengths or widths , such that strong / broad lined stars have been labelled wn - b ( hiltner & schild 1966 ) , wn - s ( hamann , koesterke & wessolowski 1993 ) or wnb ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ) . of these",
    ", none have generally been adopted . from a physical perspective ,",
    "strong- and weak - lined wn stars do form useful sub - divisions .",
    "therefore we shall define weak ( -w ) and strong ( -s ) wn stars as those with heii @xmath45412 equivalent widths smaller than or larger than 40 .",
    "an obvious limitation of such an approach is that intrinsically strong - lined wn stars would be diluted by binary companions or nearby stars in spatially crowded regions and so might not be identified as such .",
    "wne - w stars tend to exhibit triangular line profiles rather than the more typical gaussian lines of wne - s stars ( marchenko et al .",
    "2004 ) , since one observes material much closer to the stellar core that is being strongly accelerated .",
    "wc spectral subtypes depend on the line ratios of ciii and civ lines along with the appearance of o iii - v , spanning wc4 to wc9 subtypes , for which wc46 stars are ` early ' ( wce ) and wc79 are ` late ' ( wcl ) .",
    "rare , oxygen - rich wo stars form an extension of the wce sequence , exhibiting strong ovi @xmath53811 - 34 emission ( kingsburgh , barlow & storey 1995 ) .",
    "the most recent scheme involves wo1 to wo4 subtypes depending on the relative strength of ov - vi and c iv emission lines ( crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) .",
    "finally , civ @xmath45801 - 12 appears unusually strong in an otherwise normal wn star in a few cases , leading to an intermediate wn / c classification ( conti & massey 1989 ) .",
    "wn / c stars are indeed considered to be at an intermediate evolutionary phase between the wn and wc stages .",
    "representative examples of wn and wc stars are presented in figure  [ wnc - montage ] .",
    "various x - ray to mid - ir spectroscopic datasets of galactic wolf - rayet stars are presented in table  [ atlas ] , including extreme ultraviolet synthetic spectra from model atmospheres ( smith , norris & crowther 2002 ; hamann & grfener 2004 ) .",
    "wr stars can not be distinguished from normal hot stars using ubv photometry .",
    "broad - band visual measurements overestimate the true continuum level in extreme cases by up to 1 magnitude , or more typically 0.5 mag for single early - type wr stars due to their strong emission - line spectra .",
    "consequently , westerlund ( 1966 ) introduced narrow - band @xmath6 filters that were specifically designed to minimize the effect of wr emission lines ( although their effect can not be entirely eliminated ) .",
    "these passbands were later refined by smith ( 1968b ) and by massey ( 1984 ) , such that most photometry of wr stars has used the @xmath7 filter system , which is compared to johnson ubv filters in fig .",
    "[ wnc - montage ] .    as with normal stars , @xmath8 photometry permits a determination of the interstellar extinction , @xmath9 .",
    "let us adopt a typical ratio of total , @xmath10 to selective , @xmath11 extinction , @xmath12 .",
    "following turner ( 1982 ) , the broad - band and narrow - band optical indices for wr stars are then related by : @xmath13 a direct determination of wr distances via stellar parallax is only possible for @xmath14 vel ( wc8+o ) using _ hipparcos _ , and even that remains controversial ( millour et al .",
    "otherwise , cluster or association membership is used to provide an approximate absolute magnitude - spectral type calibration for milky way wr stars .",
    "the situation is much better for wr stars in the magellanic clouds , although not all subtypes are represented .",
    "typical absolute magnitudes range from @xmath15 = 3  mag at earlier subtypes to 6  mag for late subtypes , or exceptionally 7  mag for hydrogen - rich wn stars .",
    "the typical spread is @xmath160.5 mag at individual subtypes .",
    "conti ( 1976 ) first proposed that a massive o star may lose a significant amount of mass via stellar winds , revealing first the h - burning products at its surface , and subsequently the he - burning products .",
    "these evolutionary stages are spectroscopically identified with the wn and wc types .",
    "this general picture has since become known as the ` conti scenario ' .",
    "such stars should be over - luminous for their mass , in accord with observations of wr stars in binary systems .",
    "massey ( 2003 ) provides a more general overview of massive stars within local group galaxies .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are located in or close to massive star forming regions within the galactic disk .",
    "a catalogue is provided by van der hucht ( 2001 ) .",
    "a quarter of the known wr stars in the milky way reside within massive clusters at the galactic centre or in westerlund 1 ( van der hucht 2006 ) . from membership of wr stars in open clusters , schild & maeder ( 1984 ) and massey ,",
    "degioia - eastwood & waterhouse ( 2001 ) investigated the initial masses of wr stars empirically .",
    "a revised compilation is provided in crowther et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .    overall , hydrogen - rich wn stars ( wnha ) are observed in young , massive clusters ; their main - sequence turn - off masses ( based on meynet et al .",
    "1994 isochrones ) suggest initial masses of @xmath17 , and are believed to be core - h burning ( langer et al . 1994 ; crowther et al .",
    "lower - mass progenitors of 4050@xmath1 are suggested for classic mid - wn , late wc , and wo stars .",
    "progenitors of some early wn stars appear to be less massive still , suggesting an initial - mass cutoff for wr stars at solar metallicity around 25@xmath1 .    from an evolutionary perspective",
    ", the absence of rsgs at high luminosity and presence of h - rich wn stars in young massive clusters suggests the following variation of the conti scenario in the milky way , i.e. for stars initially more massive than @xmath18 @xmath19 whereas for stars of initial mass from @xmath20 , @xmath21 and for stars of initial mass in the range 2540@xmath1 , @xmath22 indeed , the role of the lbv phase is not yet settled ",
    "it may be circumvented entirely in some cases ; it may follow the rsg stage , or it may even dominate pre - wr mass - loss for the most massive stars ( langer et al .",
    "1994 ; smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "conversely , the presence of dense , circumstellar shells around type  iin sn indicates that some massive stars may even undergo core - collapse during the lbv phase ( smith et al .",
    "remarkably few milky way clusters host both rsg and wr stars , with the notable exception of westerlund  1 ( clark et al . 2005 ) ; this suggests that the mass range common to both populations is fairly narrow .",
    "although optical narrow - band surveys ( see below ) have proved very successful for identifying wr stars in the solar neighbourhood , only a few hundred wr stars are known in the milky way , whilst many thousands are expected within the galactic disk ( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "consequently , near - ir narrow - band imaging surveys together with spectroscopic follow - up may be considered for more extensive surveys to circumvent high interstellar extinction ( homeier et al .",
    ". limitations of ir emission - line surveys are that fluxes of near - ir lines are much weaker than those of optical lines , also , no strong wr lines are common to all spectral types in the frequently used k band .",
    "an added complication is that some wc stars form dust which heavily dilutes emission line fluxes longward of the visual .",
    "nevertheless , infrared surveys are presently underway to get an improved census of wr stars in the milky way .",
    "alternatively , wr candidates may be identified from their near- to mid - ir colours , which , as in other early - type supergiants , are unusual due to strong free - free excess emission ( hadfield et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "wr stars have typically been discovered via techniques sensitive to their unusually broad emission - line spectra , based on objective prism searches or interference filter imaging ( see massey 2003 ) .",
    "narrow - band interference filter techniques have been developed ( e.g. moffat , seggewiss & shara 1985 ; massey , armandroff & conti 1986 ) that distinguish strong wr emission lines at heii @xmath44686 ( wn stars ) and ciii @xmath44650 ( wc stars ) from the nearby continuum .",
    "such techniques have been applied to regions of the milky way disk , the magellanic clouds and other nearby galaxies .",
    "an example of this approach is presented in figure  [ ngc300 ] for the spiral galaxy ngc  300 ( @xmath23 2  mpc ) .",
    "a wide - field image of ngc  300 is presented , with ob complex iv - v indicated , together with narrow - band images centred at @xmath44684 ( heii 4686 ) and @xmath44781 ( continuum ) .",
    "several wr stars are seen in the difference ( heii - continuum ) image , including an apparently single wc4 star ( schild et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is well established that the absolute number of wr stars and their subtype distribution are metallicity dependent .",
    "n(wr)/n(o)@xmath00.15 in the relatively metal - rich solar neighbourhood ( conti et al . 1983",
    "; van der hucht 2001 ) , yet n(wr)/n(o)@xmath00.01 in the metal - deficient smc on the basis of only 12 wr stars ( massey , olsen & parker 2003 ) versus @xmath01000 o stars ( evans et al .",
    "it is believed that the majority of galactic wr stars are the result of single - star evolution , yet some stars ( e.g. v444 cyg ) result from close binary evolution ( vanbeveren et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "similar relative numbers of wn to wc stars are observed in the solar neighbourhood ( hadfield et al .",
    "in contrast , wn stars exceed wc stars by a factor of @xmath05 and @xmath010 for the lmc and smc , respectively ( breysacher , azzopardi & testor 1999 ; massey , olsen & parker 2001 ) . at low metallicity the reduced wr population and the relative dominance of wn subtypes most likely result from the metallicity dependence of winds from their evolutionary precursors ( mokiem et al .",
    "consequently , only the most massive single stars reach the wr phase in metal - poor environments .",
    "single stars reaching the wc phase at high metallicity may end their lives as a rsg or wn stars in a lower metallicity environment . as such , one might suspect that most wr stars at low metallicity are formed via binary evolution",
    ". however , foellmi , moffat & guerrero ( 2003a ) suggest a similar wr binary fraction for the smc and milky way .",
    "not all wr subtypes are observed in all environments .",
    "early wn and wc subtypes are preferred in metal - poor galaxies , such as the smc ( massey et al .",
    "2003 ) , while late wc stars are more common at super - solar metallicities , such as m83 ( hadfield et al . 2005 ) line widths of early wc and wo stars are higher than late wc stars , although width alone is not a defining criterion for each spectral type .",
    "the correlation between wc subclass and line width is nevertheless strong ( torres , conti & massey 1986 ) .",
    "the subtype distributions of wr stars in the solar neighbourhood , lmc , and smc are presented in figure  [ wrpop ] .",
    "we shall address this aspect in sect  [ metallicity ] .",
    "individual wr stars may , in general , be resolved in local group galaxies from ground - based observations , whilst the likelihood of contamination by nearby sources increases at larger distances .",
    "for example , a typical slit width of 1@xmath24 at the 2mpc distance of ngc  300 corresponds to a spatial scale of @xmath010  pc .",
    "relatively isolated wr stars have been identified , albeit in the minority ( recall figure  [ ngc300 ] ) .",
    "this is even more problematic for more distant galaxies such as m  83 where the great majority of wr stars are observed in clusters or associations ( hadfield et al . 2005 ) .",
    "so - called ` wr galaxies ' are typically starburst regions exhibiting spectral features from tens , hundreds , or even thousands of wr stars ( schaerer , contini & pindao 1999 ) .",
    "average milky way / lmc wn or wc line fluxes ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) are typically used to calculate stellar populations in wr galaxies .",
    "these should be valid provided that the line fluxes of wr templates do not vary with environment .",
    "however , it is well known that smc wn stars possess weak emission lines ( conti , garmany & massey 1989 ) . in spite of small statistics and a large scatter ,",
    "the mean heii @xmath44686 line luminosity of wn24 stars in the lmc is 10@xmath25 ergs@xmath26 , a factor of five times higher than the mean of equivalent stars in the smc ( crowther & hadfield 2006 ) .",
    "the signature of wn stars is most readily seen in star forming galaxies at heii @xmath41640 , where the dilution from other stellar types is at its weakest ( e.g. hadfield & crowther 2006 ) .",
    "the strongest uv , optical , and near - ir lines indicate flux ratios of @xmath27(heii 1640)/@xmath27(heii 4686)@xmath010 and @xmath27(he ii 4686)/@xmath27(heii 1.012@xmath28m)@xmath06 for wn stars spanning smc to milky way metallicities .",
    "similar comparisons for wc stars are hindered because the only carbon - sequence wr stars at the low metallicity of the smc and ic  1613 are wo stars .",
    "their emission line fluxes are systematically weaker than wc stars in the lmc and milky way ( kingsburgh et al .",
    "1995 ; kingsburgh & barlow 1995 ; schaerer & vacca 1998 ) . the mean civ @xmath55801 - 2 line luminosity of wc4 stars in the lmc is @xmath29 ergs@xmath26 ( crowther & hadfield 2006 ) .",
    "again , detection of wc stars is favoured via ultraviolet spectroscopy of civ @xmath41550 . for wc stars ,",
    "the strongest uv , optical , and near - ir lines possess flux ratios of @xmath27(civ 1548 - 51)/@xmath27(civ 5801 - 12)@xmath06 and @xmath27(c iv 5801 - 12)/@xmath27(civ 2.08@xmath28m)@xmath015 .",
    "the observed binary fraction amongst milky way wr stars is 40% ( van der hucht 2001 ) , either from spectroscopic or indirect techniques . within the low metallicity magellanic clouds",
    ", close binary evolution would be anticipated to play a greater role because of the diminished role of o star mass - loss in producing single wr stars . however ,",
    "where detailed studies have been carried out ( bartzakos , moffat & niemela 2001 ; foellmi , moffat & guerrero 2003ab ) , a similar binary fraction to the milky way has been obtained ( recall figure  [ wrpop ] ) , so metallicity - independent lbv eruptions may play a dominant role .",
    "the most robust method of measuring stellar masses is from kepler s third law of motion , particularly for eclipsing double - lined ( sb2 ) systems , from which the inclination may be derived .",
    "orbital inclinations may also be derived from linear polarization studies ( e.g. st - louis et al .",
    "1993 ) or atmospheric eclipses ( lamontagne et al . 1996 ) . masses for galactic wr stars",
    "are included in the van der hucht ( 2001 ) compilation , a subset of which are presented in figure  [ binary_masses ] together with some more recent results .",
    "wc masses span a narrow range of 916@xmath1 , whilst wn stars span a very wide range of @xmath01083@xmath1 , and in some cases exceed their ob companion , i.e. @xmath30 ( e.g. wr22 : schweickhardt et al . 1999 ) .",
    "wr20a ( smsp2 ) currently sets the record for the highest orbital - derived mass of any star , with @xmath31 for each wn6 ha component ( rauw et al .",

    "they are a factor of two lower in mass than the apparent @xmath32 stellar mass limit ( figer 2005 ) , such that still more extreme cases may await discovery .",
    "spectroscopic measurement of masses via surface gravities using photospheric lines is not possible for wr stars due to their dense stellar winds .",
    "rotation is very difficult to measure in wr stars , since photospheric features  used to estimate @xmath33 in normal stars  are absent .",
    "velocities of 200500 kms@xmath26 have been inferred for wr138 ( massey 1980 ) and wr3 ( massey & conti 1981 ) , although these are not believed to represent rotation velocities , since the former has a late - o binary companion , and the absorption lines of the latter are formed within the stellar wind ( marchenko et al .",
    "2004 ) . fortunately , certain wr stars do harbour large scale structures , from which a rotation period may be inferred ( st - louis et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , if wr stars were rapid rotators , one would expect strong deviations from spherical symmetry due to gravity darkening ( von zeipel 1924 ; owocki , cranmer & gayley 1996 ) .",
    "harries , hillier & howarth ( 1998 ) studied linear spectropolarimetric datasets for 29 galactic wr stars , from which just four single wn stars plus one wc+o binary revealed a strong line effect , suggesting significant departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "they presented radiative transfer calculations which suggest that the observed continuum polarizations for these stars can be matched by models with equator to pole density ratios of 23 .",
    "of course , the majority of milky way wr stars do not show a strong linear polarization line effect ( e.g. kurosawa , hillier & schulte - ladbeck ( 1999 ) .",
    "ring nebulae are observed for a subset of wr stars .",
    "these are believed to represent material ejected during the rsg or lbv phases that is photo - ionized by the wr star .",
    "the first known examples , ngc  2359 and ngc  6888 , display a shell morphology , although many subsequently detected in the milky way and magellanic clouds exhibit a variety of spatial morphologies ( chu , treffers & kwitter 1983 ; dopita et al .",

    "ring nebulae provide information on evolutionary links between wr stars and their precursors ( weaver et al .",

    "our interpretation of hot , luminous stars via radiative transfer codes is hindered with respect to normal stars by several effects .",
    "first , the routine assumption of lte breaks down for high - temperature stars . in non - lte",
    ", the determination of populations uses rates which are functions of the radiation field , itself a function of the populations .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to solve for the radiation field and populations iteratively .",
    "second , the problem of accounting for the effect of millions of spectral lines upon the emergent atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum  known as line blanketing  remains challenging for stars in which spherical , rather than plane - parallel , geometry must be assumed due to stellar winds , since the scale height of their atmospheres is not negligible with respect to their stellar radii .",
    "the combination of non - lte , line blanketing ( and availability of atomic data thereof ) , and spherical geometry has prevented the routine analysis of such stars until recently .",
    "radiative transfer is either solved in the co - moving frame , as applied by cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) and powr ( grfener , koesterke & hamann 2002 ) or via the sobolev approximation , as used by isa - wind ( de koter , schmutz & lamers 1993 ) .",
    "the incorporation of line blanketing necessitates one of several approximations .",
    "either a ` super - level ' approach is followed , in which spectral lines of a given ion are grouped together in the solution of the rate equations ( anderson 1989 ) , or alternatively , a monte carlo approach is followed , which uses approximate level populations ( abbott & lucy 1985 ) .",
    "stellar temperatures for wr stars are difficult to characterize , because their geometric extension is comparable with their stellar radii .",

    "historically , it has not been clear whether radiation pressure alone is sufficient to drive the high mass - loss rates of wr stars .",
    "let us briefly review the standard castor , abbott & klein ( 1975 , hereafter cak ) theory behind radiatively driven winds before addressing the question of line driving for wr stars .",
    "pulsations have also been proposed for wr stars , as witnessed in intensive monitoring for the most photometrically variable wn8 star with the _ most _ satellite by lefvre et al .",
    "interpretation of such observations however remains ambiguous ( townsend & macdonald 2006 ; dorfi , gautschy & saio 2006 ) .      the combination of plentiful line opacity in the extreme uv , where the photospheric radiation originates , allows for efficient driving of hot star winds by radiation pressure ( milne 1926 ) . in a static atmosphere , the photospheric radiation will only be efficiently absorbed or scattered in the lower layers of the atmosphere , weakening the radiative acceleration , @xmath112 , in the outer layers .",
    "in contrast , atoms within the outer layers of an expanding atmosphere see the photosphere as doppler - shifted radiation , allowing absorption of undiminished continuum photons in their line transitions ( sobolev 1960 ) .",
    "the force from optically thick lines , which provide the radiative acceleration by absorbing the photon momentum , scale with the velocity gradient .",
    "there can be at most @xmath113 thick lines , implying a so - called single - scattering limit @xmath114 castor , abbott & klein ( 1975 ) and abbott ( 1982 ) developed a self - consistent solution of the wind properties , from which one obtains a velocity ` law ' @xmath115 for which @xmath116=0.8 for o - type stars ( pauldrach , puls & kudritzki 1986 ) .",
    "@xmath112 can be written in terms of the thompson ( electron ) scattering acceleration , i.e. @xmath117 .",
    "the equation of motion can then be expressed as @xmath118 it is clear that both @xmath57 and @xmath119 need to be large for a hot star to possess a wind . in the cak approach , optically thick lines are assumed not to overlap within the wind . in reality , this is rarely true in the extreme uv where spectral lines are very tightly packed and the bulk of the line driving originates .",
    "consequently , another approach is needed for wr stars whose winds exceed the single scattering limit ( lamers & leitherer 1993 ) , namely the consideration of multiple scattering .      historically , the strength of wr winds were considered to be mass dependent , but metallicity - independent ( langer 1989 ) .",
    "observational evidence now favours metallicity - dependent wr winds , with a dependence of dm / dt @xmath107 , with @xmath120 for wn stars ( sect .",
    "[ metallicity ] ) .",
    "it is established that o star winds are driven by radiation pressure , with a metallicity dependence that is similar to wn stars ( mokiem et al .",
    "consequently , the notion that wr winds are radiatively driven is observationally supported .    theoretically , lucy & abbott ( 1993 ) and springmann ( 1994 ) produced monte carlo wind models for wr stars in which multiple - scattering was achieved by the presence of multiple ionization stages in the wind .",
    "however , a prescribed velocity and ionization structure was adopted in both case studies , plus the inner wind acceleration was not explained .",
    "schmutz ( 1997 ) first tackled the problem of driving wr winds from radiatively - driven winds self - consistently using a combined monte carlo and radiative transfer approach .",
    "he also introduced a means of photon - loss from the heii ly@xmath2",
    "303  line via a bowen resonance - fluorescence mechanism .",
    "this effect led to a change in the ionization equilibrium of helium , requiring a higher stellar luminosity .",
    "the consideration of wind clumping by schmutz ( 1997 ) did succeed in providing a sufficiently strong outflow in the outer wind .",
    "photon - loss nevertheless failed to initiate the requisite powerful acceleration in the deep atmospheric layers .",
    "subsequent studies have supported the principal behind the photon - loss mechanism for wr stars , although the effect is modest ( e.g. de marco et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the next advance for the inner wind driving was by nugis & lamers ( 2002 ) whose analytical study suggested that the ( hot ) iron opacity peak at 10@xmath121  k is responsible for the observed wr mass - loss in an optically thick wind ( a cooler opacity peak exists at 10@xmath122k ) .",
    "indeed , grfener & hamann ( 2005 ) established that highly ionized fe ions ( feix - xvii ) provides the necessary opacity for initiating wr winds deep in the atmosphere for wr111 ( hd  165763=wr111 , wc5 ) . the wind acceleration due to radiation and gas pressure self - consistently matches the mechanical and gravitational acceleration in their hydrodynamical model .",
    "grfener & hamann ( 2005 ) achieved the observed terminal wind velocity by adopting an extremely low outer wind filling factor of @xmath96=0.02 .",
    "this degree of clumping is unrealistic since predicted line electron scattering wings are too weak with respect to observations .",
    "a more physical outer wind solution should be permitted by the inclusion of more complete opacities from other elements such as ne and ar .",
    "the velocity structure from the grfener & hamann ( 1995 ) hydrodynamical model closely matches a typical @xmath116=1 velocity law of the form in eqn  [ velocity_law ] in the inner wind .",
    "a slower @xmath116=5 law is more appropriate for the outer wind .",
    "indeed , such a hybrid velocity structure was first proposed by hillier & miller ( 1999 ) .",
    "theoretically , both the hydrodynamical models of grfener & hamann ( 2005 ) and recent monte carlo wind models for wr stars by vink & de koter ( 2005 ) argue in favour of radiation pressure through metal lines as responsible for the observed multiple - scattering in wr winds .",
    "the critical parameter involving the development of strong outflows is the proximity of wr stars to the eddington limit , according to grfener & hamann ( 2007 ) .",
    "vink & de koter ( 2005 ) performed a multiple - scattering study of wr stars at fixed stellar temperatures and eddington parameter .",
    "a metallicity scaling of dm / dt @xmath107 with @xmath123=0.86 for 10@xmath124 was obtained .",
    "this exponent is similar to empirical wn and o star results across a more restricted metallicity range .",
    "grfener & hamann ( 2007 ) predict a decrease in the exponent or late - type wn stars at higher @xmath57 , plus reduced wind velocities at lower metallicities .",
    "vink & de koter ( 2005 ) predict that the high metal content of wc stars favour a weaker dependence with metallicity than wn stars . a mass - loss scaling with exponent @xmath123=0.66 for @xmath125 is predicted .",
    "this is consistent with the observed wc mass - loss dependence between the lmc and milky way . at low metallicity ,",
    "vink & de koter ( 2005 ) predict a weak dependence of @xmath123=0.35 for @xmath126 providing atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances are metallicity - independent .",
    "the components of a massive binary may evolve independently , as if they were single stars providing their orbital periods are sufficiently large . in contrast , an interacting or close binary system represents the case in which the more massive primary component expands to fill its roche lobe , causing mass exchange to the secondary . for an initial period of several days , the primary will reach its roche lobe whilst still on the h - core burning main sequence ( case a ) and transfer the majority of its hydrogen - rich envelope to the secondary . for initial periods of a few weeks or years , mass transfer will occur during the hydrogen - shell burning phase ( case b ) or he - shell burning ( case c ) , respectively .",
    "cases b and c are much more common than case a due to the much larger range of orbital periods sampled . according to vanbeveren , de loore & van rensbergen ( 1998 )",
    "a common envelope will occur instead of roche lobe overflow if there is an lbv phase .",
    "close binary evolution will extend the formation of wr stars to lower initial mass , and consequently lower luminosity with respect to single star evolution ( e.g. vanbeveren et al .",
    "the observed lower mass limit to wr formation in the milky way is broadly consistent with the single star scenario ( meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , either low - mass he stars are not recognised spectroscopically as wr stars , or they may be too heavily diluted by their brighter o star companions for them to be observed .",
    "one natural , albeit rare , consequence of massive close binary evolution involves the evolution of the initial primary to core - collapse , with a neutron star or black hole remnant , in which the system remains bound as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb , wellstein & langer 1999 ) .",
    "the ob secondary may then evolve through to the wolf - rayet phase , producing a wr plus neutron star or black hole binary .",
    "for many years , searches for such systems proved elusive , until it was discovered that cyg x3 , a 4.8 hour period x - ray bright system possessed the near - ir spectrum of a he - star ( van kerkwijk et al . 1992 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of cyg x3 remains somewhat controversial .",
    "wr plus compact companion candidates have also been identified in external galaxies , ic  10 x1 ( bauer & brandt 2004 ) and ngc  300 x-1 ( carpano et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the presence of two early - type stars within a binary system naturally leads to a wind - wind interaction region . in general , details of the interaction process",
    "are investigated by complex hydrodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , the analytical approach of stevens , blondin & pollock ( 1992 ) provides a useful insight into the physics of the colliding winds .    a subset of wr stars display non - thermal ( synchrotron ) radio emission , in addition to the thermal radio emission produced via free - free emission from their stellar wind .",
    "consequently , a magnetic field must be present in the winds of such stars , with relativistic electrons in the radio emitting region .",
    "shocks associated with a wind collision may act as sites for particle acceleration through the fermi mechanism ( eichler & usov 1993 ) .",
    "free electrons would undergo acceleration to relativistic velocities by crossing the shock front between the interacting stellar winds .",
    "indeed , the majority of non - thermal wr radio emitters are known binaries .",
    "for example , wr140 ( wc7+o ) is a highly eccentric system with a 7.9 year period , in which the radio flux is thermal over the majority of the orbit . between phases 0.55 and 0.95 ( where phase 0 corresponds to periastron passage )",
    ", the radio flux increases dramatically and displays a non - thermal radio index ( williams et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "one may introduce the wind momentum ratio , @xmath127 @xmath128 where the mass loss rates and wind velocities of components @xmath129 are given by @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively . in the simplest case of @xmath127=1 , the intersection between the winds occurs in a plane midway between the two stars . in the more likely situation of @xmath132 1 ,",
    "the contact discontinuity appears as a cone wrapped around the star with the less momentum in its wind . by way of example ,",
    "radio emission in the wr147 ( wn8 + b0.5 ) system has been spatially resolved into two components : thermal emission from the wn8 primary wind , plus non - thermal emission located close to the companion ( williams et al .",
    "the location of the non - thermal component is consistent with the ram pressure balance of the two stellar winds , from which a momentum ratio of @xmath133 can be obtained .    for early - type stars that have reached their terminal velocities of several thousand kms@xmath26 ,",
    "the post - shock plasma temperature is very high ( @xmath134  k ) .",
    "x - rays represent the main observational signature of shock - heated plasma .",
    "significantly harder x - ray fluxes are expected from massive binaries with respect to single stars .",
    "phase - locked x - ray variability is expected due to the change in opacity along the line - of - sight , or varying separation for eccentric binaries ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) . a colliding wind system in which substantial phase - locked variability has been observed with _",
    "is @xmath14 vel ( wc8+o ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from the shock is absorbed when the opaque wind from the wr star lies in front of the o star .",
    "when the cavity around the o star crosses our line - of - sight , x - ray emission is significantly less absorbed ( willis , schild & stevens 1995 ) .",
    "the principal sources of interstellar dust are cool , high mass - losing stars , such as red giants , asymptotic giant branch stars , plus novae and supernovae .",
    "dust is observed around some massive stars , particularly lbvs with ejecta nebulae , but aside from their giant eruptions , this may be material that has been swept up by the stellar wind . the intense radiation fields of young , massive stars would be expected to prevent dust formation in their local environment .",
    "however , allen , swings & harvey ( 1972 ) identified excess ir emission in a subset of wc stars , arising from @xmath01000  k circumstellar dust .",
    "williams , van der hucht & th ( 1987 ) investigated the infrared properties of galactic wc stars , revealing persistent dust formation in some systems , or episodic formation in other cases .",
    "for a single star whose wind is homogeneous and spherically symmetric , carbon is predicted to remain singly or even doubly ionized due to high electron temperatures of @xmath010@xmath135k in the region where dust formation is observed to occur",
    ". however , the formation of graphite or more likely amorphous carbon grains requires a high density of neutral carbon close to the wc star .",
    "one clue to the origin of dust is provided by wr140 ( hd  193793 , wc7+o ) which forms dust episodically , near periastron passage . at this phase",
    "the power in the colliding winds is at its greatest ( williams et al .",
    "usov ( 1991 ) analytically showed that the wind conditions of wr140 at periastron favour a strong gas compression in the vicinity of the shock surface , providing an outflow of cold gas .",
    "it is plausible that high density , low temperature , carbon - rich material associated with the bow - shock in a colliding wind wc binary provides the necessary environment for dust formation .",
    "in contrast to episodic dust formers , persistent wc systems are rarely spectroscopic wc binaries , for which wr104 ( ve  2 - 45 , wc9 ) is the prototype identified by allen et al .",
    "spectroscopic evidence from crowther ( 1997 ) suggested the presence of an ob companion in the wr104 system when the inner wc wind was obscured by a dust cloud , analogous to r  coronae borealis stars .",
    "conclusive proof of the binary nature of wr104 has been established by tuthill , monnier & danchi ( 1999 ) from high spatial resolution near - ir imaging .",
    "dust associated with wr104 forms a spatially confined stream that follows a spiral trajectory ( so - called ` pinwheel ' ) , analogous to a garden rotary sprinker .",
    "the cocoon stars after which the quintuplet cluster at the galactic centre was named have also been identified as dusty wc pinwheel stars by tuthill et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "binarity appears to play a key role in the formation of dust in wc stars , providing the necessary high density within the shocked wind interaction region , plus shielding from the hard ionizing photons .",
    "the presence of hydrogen from the ob companion may provide the necessary chemical seeding in the otherwise hydrogen - free wc environment . alas , this possibility does have difficulties , since chemical mixing between the wc and ob winds may not occur in the immediate vicinity of the shock region .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that all dust forming wc stars are binaries .",
    "the various inputs to stellar interior evolutionary models originate from either laboratory experiments ( e.g. opacities , nuclear reaction rates ) or astronomical observations ( e.g. mass - loss properties , rotation rates ) .",
    "indeed , mass - loss ( rather than convection ) has a dominant effect upon stellar models for the most massive stars .",
    "here we illustrate one of the potential pitfalls of this approach . according to koesterke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , stellar luminosities of some weak - lined early - type wn stars were unexpectedly low ( @xmath136 ) . in order to reproduce such results , plus the observed n(wr)/n(o ) ratio , meynet et al .",

    "improvements in non - lte models have subsequently led to higher derived stellar luminosities ( e.g. hamann , grfener & liermann 2006 ) .",
    "revised wr luminosities removed the primary motivation behind elevated mass - loss rates .",
    "indeed , allowance for wind clumping has now led to the need to reduce mass - loss rates in evolutionary models .",
    "mass - loss and rotation are intimately linked for the evolution of massive stars .",
    "stellar winds will lead to spin - down for the case of an efficient internal angular momentum transport mechanism . at solar metallicity , one anticipates rapid spin - down for very massive stars due to their strong stellar winds ( langer 1998 ) .",
    "initial rotational velocities are erased within a few million years .",
    "in contrast , initial conditions may remain preserved throughout the main sequence lifetime of o - type stars in metal - poor environments due to their weak stellar winds .",
    "discrepancies between evolutionary model predictions and a number of observed properties of high mass stars led to the incorporation of rotational mixing into interior models , following the theoretical treatment of zahn ( 1992 ) .",

    "the wr population of ic  10 remains controversial , since high galactic foreground extinction favours the detection of wc stars over wn stars .",

    "h - rich ( core h - burning ) wn stars are readily distinguished from classic h - deficient ( core he - burning ) wn , wc and wo stars .",
    "significant progress has been achieved in interior evolutionary models through the incorporation of rotational mixing .",
    "contemporary ( i.e. low ) mass - loss rates together with rotational mixing permits many of the observed properties of wr stars to be reproduced , at least those close to solar metallicity .",
    "2 .   empirical evidence and theoretical models both favour metallicity - dependent wr wind , providing a natural explanation to the wc ( and wo ) subtype distribution in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "a metallicity dependence is partially responsible for the wn subtype dependence , although the reduced nitrogen content in metal - poor galaxies also plays a role .",
    "the development of consistent radiatively - driven wr winds represents an important milestone .",
    "the predicted metallicity dependence of mass - loss rates from radiatively driven wind models agrees with observational estimates .",
    "the apparent convergence of spectroscopic and interior models suggests that we can re - assess the contribution of wr stars to the ionizing , mechanical and chemical enrichment of the ism in young star forming regions with respect to the previous annual review article on this subject ( abbott & conti 1987 ) .",
    "wr stars emit a high number of lyman continuum photons due to higher inferred stellar luminosities as a result of the inclusion of line blanketing in atmospheric models .",
    "inferred wr mass - loss rates have decreased due to overwhelming evidence in favour of clumped winds .",
    "the chemical enrichment from wr stars is believed to be significant due to an extended wc phase , as a result of rotational mixing within evolutionary models .",
    "current non - lte models rely upon a simplified clumpy wind structure , plus spherical symmetry .",
    "theoretical hydrodynamic predictions for the radial dependence of clumping in wr winds is anticipated to represent a major area of development over the next decade together with two dimensional non - lte radiative transfer codes .",
    "discrepancies persist between empirical wr populations and predictions from evolutionary models which allow for rotational mixing .",
    "metallicity dependent wr winds may improve consistency , together with the incorporation of magnetic fields .",
    "spatially resolved clusters rich in wr stars , such as westerlund  1 ( if it is genuinely co - eval ) , provide a direct means of testing evolutionary predictions .",
    "observational limits on magnetic fields within wolf - rayet stars are underway .",
    "the role of rotation in wr stars at low metallicity is of particular interest . at present , amongst the best means of establishing rapid rotation in wr stars is by measuring departures from spherical symmetry using spectropolarimetry .",
    "this technique has been applied to bright wr stars in the milky way , but wr stars within the magellanic clouds are also within the reach of ground - based 8 - 10 m instruments .",
    "the evolutionary paths leading to wr stars and core - collapse sn remain uncertain , as is the role played by lbv eruptions for the most massive stars .",
    "given the observational connection between type ic supernovae and long - soft grbs , do grbs result from low metallicity massive stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution , massive binaries during a common envelope phase , or runaways from dense star clusters ?",
    "the presence of wr stars in large numbers within very low metallicity galaxies appears contrary to the expectations of single star evolutionary models neglecting rotational mixing .",
    "are such stars exclusively produced by rapid rotation , close binary evolution , or via giant lbv eruptions ? 6 .",
    "most late wc stars are known to be dust formers , the universal presence of binary companions is not yet established for all dusty wc stars .",
    "in addition , it is not clear how dust grains form within such an extreme environment , the study of which merits further study .",
