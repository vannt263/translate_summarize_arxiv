    "progress in the technology of group - iii nitrides , discovery of unique material properties and perspectives of high - power , and high - frequency applications  @xcite have inspired studies of high - field transport regimes in these materials  @xcite , including the high - frequency phenomena  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were focused to very high electric fields ( @xmath2 ) , where the intervalley electron transfer and the gunn effects are expected .",
    "also there is a necessity of understanding of hot electron kinetics in the range of moderate electric fields ( @xmath3 ) , because of fundamental and practical importance of such a case .",
    "indeed , it is believed ( see recent review  @xcite ) that in polar nitride materials subjected to a moderately high electric field , strong inelastic optical phonon scattering can provide the so - called streaming transport regime .",
    "the latter is characterized by considerable anisotropy of electron distribution in the momentum space , quasi - saturation of the current - field dependence , negative dynamic conductivity and other useful effects .    in general ,",
    "the following conditions are favorable to realize the streaming regime : ( i ) strong electron - optical phonon coupling , ( ii ) low temperatures which provide optical phonon emission as dominant scattering mechanism of hot electrons and ( iii ) relatively low electron concentrations , when e - e scattering is negligible . according to the analysis given in a number of the works  @xcite ,",
    "these conditions can be met in the nitride materials , as well as in the nitride heterostructures  @xcite . at the streaming regime ,",
    "the electron motion is nearly periodic : in an appropriate range of the _ dc _ electric field , an electron accelerates quasiballistically until it reaches the optical phonon energy , then the electron loses its energy by emitting an optical phonon and starts the next period of acceleration .",
    "such a mechanism of the nearly periodic electron motion leads to electric field induced resonances in high - frequency conductivity [ the so - called optical phonon transient time resonance ( opttr ) ]  @xcite .",
    "the opttr provides an operating principle for electrically pumped semiconductor sub - thz and thz sources  @xcite , that has been practically realized in n - inp crystals  @xcite .    experimental observation of the opttr in the nitrides and its further device implementation is impeded by the deficit of electron transport data for the range of moderate electric fields , including high - frequency properties .",
    "additional useful information on properties of the nitrides can be obtained by investigation of magnetic field effects on charge carriers , for example , investigation of the electron cyclotron resonance ( cr ) .",
    "it is well known , that exploitation of the cr is a powerful spectroscopic method that allows to determine important parameters of the band structure and carrier dynamics ( for a detail review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . monitoring the cyclotron resonance in an electric field ,",
    "one can study intraband dynamic processes of nonequilibrium carriers .",
    "for example , the cyclotron resonance technique was successfully used to study _ hot electrons and holes _ in ge  @xcite , si  @xcite , insb  @xcite , gaas  @xcite and other important semiconductor materials . as the result",
    ", the detailed features of hot carrier kinetics have been understood .",
    "these include : relaxation mechanisms and their parameters , character of carrier distribution in the momentum space , the dynamic conductivity , etc .",
    "recently , the cyclotron resonance was observed in the nitrides at moderate and high magnetic fields ( above 5 tesla ) . here",
    "the resonance became apparent in thz - frequency range  @xcite , because of small sub - picosecond relaxation times characteristic for the nitrides .    in this paper by the use of the monte - carlo method , we study gan bulk - like material in moderate electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we focus on high - frequency response of gan under conditions , when both resonances , the cr and the opttr , become apparent simultaneously .",
    "we show that overlapping of the two resonances produces specific spectra of thz transmission and reflection , as well as characteristic polarization effects .",
    "we consider a bulk gan sample of the cubic modification with a given concentration of ionized impurity , @xmath4 . to exclude quenching effect on the opttr by electron - electron scattering",
    "we suppose that the sample is compensated , thus the electron concentration @xmath5 . at electric fields of a moderate strength ,",
    "all electrons remain in the @xmath6 valley and can be characterized by the parabolic dispersion law with the effective mass , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 electric field , @xmath9 , and the magnetic field , @xmath10 , are assumed to be parallel .",
    "let the both fields be directed along @xmath11 axis , @xmath12 .",
    "the magnetic field is treated as a classical one .",
    "the @xmath13 electric field is supposed to be harmonic , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the frequency . to find the small - signal response ,",
    "the @xmath13 field is considered as a small perturbation , @xmath16 .    to calculate electron transport characteristics and , particularly , frequency dependent dynamic mobility , @xmath17",
    ", we use the single - particle algorithm of the monte - carlo procedure  @xcite . for the simulation of the electron transport",
    "we take into account the main three scattering mechanism : scattering by ionized impurities , acoustic phonons and polar - optical phonons . for the ionized impurity scattering ,",
    "we exploit the `` mixed '' scattering model that unifies both brooks - herring and conwell - weisskopf approaches .",
    "this approach is more appropriate for the analysis of compensated materials .",
    "the formulae of electron scattering probabilities for these mechanisms can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the limit of a classical magnetic field",
    "the scattering probabilities do not depend on this field .",
    "however , the magnetic field determines the lorentz force , so that electron dynamics between sequential collisions is described by the equation : @xmath18 \\right ] , \\label{eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the electron velocity , @xmath20 is the elementary charge , @xmath21 is the light velocity . to avoid cumbersome expressions for @xmath22 during free flight between collisions we present here only velocity modulation by the",
    "field , @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an initial moment , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "we used eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) to apply the monte - carlo procedure to the steady - state kinetics and high - frequency response of the electron gas subjected to both electric and magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "first , we studied the steady - state distribution function of hot - electrons , the drift velocity , @xmath28 , the average energy , @xmath29 , and other stationary electron characteristics in wide range of applied @xmath8 electric fields , when the magnetic field , @xmath30 is present . in fig.[fig0 ] we show an example of calculations of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and distribution function .",
    "these results are discussed below in more details .    for the magnetic fields of a moderate strength ( @xmath31 )",
    ", we found that these characteristics practically are independent on the magnetic field .",
    "this is a consequence of two main factors : ( i ) for the parabolic electron dispersion and the parallel configuration of electric and magnetic fields , electron motion along fields direction and that in perpendicular plane are uncoupled ; ( ii ) the magnetic field does not affect the energy balance of the electron system .",
    "the detail analysis of the steady - state transport characteristics in compensated gan can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the presence of steady - state electric and magnetic fields ,",
    "the high - frequency response can be characterized by the dynamical mobility , which is the tensor , @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamic mobility tensor defines the @xmath13 electric current induced by the @xmath13 field , @xmath33 . for the considered configuration of the fields , this tensor has five non - zero components : @xmath34 where only three components , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are linearly independent .",
    "other components are @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "note , at @xmath40 nondiagonal components are equal to zero . in next section",
    "we present the analysis of spectra of all components of @xmath17 and their dependencies on the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "prior to discussion of results on the hot - electron dynamical mobility , @xmath41 , we shall estimate ranges of the parameters favorable for observation of the opttr and the cr effects in gan .    for concentrations of the electrons and ionized impurities we set @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the lattice temperature is assumed to be 30 k. for the gan material parameters , such as effective mass , dielectric constants , deformation potential , etc , we used the database from ref .",
    "@xcite the low field mobility was calculated to be @xmath45 , which is well correlated with the measured mobility in gan samples of low dislocation density  @xcite .",
    "for these parameters , the streaming transport regime and the opttr are the most pronounced in the range of the @xmath8 electric fields @xmath46 . as seen from fig .",
    "( a ) , in this range of applied @xmath8 electric fields the drift velocity and the averaged energy show the typical quasisaturation behavior . as the results of streaming electron motion , the strongly asymmetric electron distribution function is formed in momentum space . in figs .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , we present both longitudinal and transversal profiles of the distribution function for the case of developed streaming , @xmath47 .",
    "as seen , the transversal profile of the distribution function remains symmetric . while for the longitudinal one shows strong asymmetry : the electrons have momenta mainly directed along the applied force .",
    "the streaming distribution leads to the effect of opttr in the frequency range @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "classical treatment of electron motion in the magnetic field requires the condition @xmath49 . for the above range of the electric field ,",
    "the average hot electron energy in gan is estimated to be @xmath50 .",
    "then , the latter inequality gives limitations : @xmath51 thz and @xmath52 t. in what follows , we restricted ourself to the analysis of moderate magnetic fields , @xmath53 , which correspond to the cyclotron frequency @xmath54 .      a representative example of the dynamic mobility of hot electrons under the developed streaming regime ( @xmath55 ) is given in fig .",
    "the magnetic field is set to be @xmath56 . in this figure , three independent tensor components , @xmath57 ,",
    "are shown as functions of the frequency , @xmath15 .",
    "the longitudinal ( with respect to the applied fields ) component , @xmath58 , is practically independent on the magnetic field and demonstrates all signs of the opttr effect : an oscillation behavior of both @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] , and a frequency `` window '' , where the real part of the dynamic mobility is negative , @xmath59 < 0 $ ] . minimum of @xmath59 $ ] reaches the value @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "notice , absolute values of @xmath59 $ ] including the case @xmath63 are much smaller than the low field mobility . this is a consequence of above mentioned quasi - saturation of the velocity - field characteristics .",
    "the transverse component , @xmath64 , and off - diagonal component , @xmath65 , are dependent on both @xmath66 fields and demonstrate features proper to the cr .",
    "the maximum of @xmath67 $ ] and zero of @xmath60 $ ] occur at @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the used parameters . in the vicinity of @xmath70",
    ", we find that @xmath67 $ ] is considerably larger than @xmath71|$ ] .",
    "this is because all electrons contribute to the cr , while exclusively streaming electrons contribute to the opttr effect .",
    "we found that spectral dependencies of two tensor components , @xmath72 , can be approximately described by the simple drude - lorentz model that takes into account electron motion in a magnetic field .",
    "for this model , the components are @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an effective relaxation time . as seen from figures  [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , eqs .",
    "( [ drude ] ) give a good fitting to the monte carlo result for @xmath75 .",
    "herewith , the cr is well pronounced , because @xmath76 .      for the analyzed configuration of @xmath77 and @xmath30 fields , the electric field does not affect the cyclotron motion of the electrons in the @xmath78-plane .",
    "instead , this field modifies the electron distribution and alters relaxation processes , and , consequently , the effective relaxation time , @xmath74 .    the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrate the electric field effect on the cyclotron resonance .",
    "one can see that , when the @xmath77 field varies , the frequency of the resonance remains equal to @xmath70 , while the sharpness of the resonance degrades considerably with increase of the @xmath77 field magnitude .",
    "for example , at @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) the cyclotron peak in @xmath81 $ ] practically disappears when @xmath82 ( see fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "this is , obviously , due to an intensification of scattering processes . for the larger magnetic field , @xmath83 ,",
    "the cr remains observable for the range @xmath84 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "therein we present also the @xmath77 field dependence of the effective relaxation time , @xmath74 , found by fitting eqs .",
    "[ drude ] to the monte - carlo results .",
    "it is interesting , that for the @xmath77 field range , @xmath85 , when the streaming regime is formed , @xmath86 dependence qualitatively correlates with the transit - time , @xmath87 , during which a ballistically accelerated electron reaches the optical phonon energy , @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "thus under very fast process of optical phonon emission , the width of the cr is determined rather by the dynamic characteristic , @xmath87 .",
    "to measure microwave / optical effects in a magnetic field one uses , typically , the faraday and/or voigt configurations of an incident wave and a magnetic field . the cr can be observed for both configurations , while the opttr can be measured only for the voigt configuration ( if @xmath90 and @xmath91 fields are parallel ) . to study coexistence and interplay of both resonant effects",
    "we will focus on the _ voigt configuration_.    for certainty , we set that the incident electromagnetic wave propagates along the oy axis and the high - frequency electric field , @xmath92 , lies in the @xmath93-plane .",
    "the incident wave is supposed to be linearly polarized .",
    "then , for the wave polarization along the @xmath94 axis ( @xmath95 ) the cr is observable , but the opttr is absent . to the contrary , for the wave polarization along the @xmath11 axis ( @xmath96 )",
    "the cr is missed , but the opttr appears . for other polarizations ,",
    "both resonances coexist and affect each other .",
    "interplay of the two resonances becomes apparent , for example , in transmission spectra .",
    "these spectra comprise two contributions from electron and lattice subsystems . in additions , the spectra vary with the sample thickness because of reflection and interference effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we show the transmission spectra of a gan sample in the thz frequency range , where the cr and the opttr appear . the electron parameters and magnitudes of the @xmath77 , @xmath30 fields are the same as in fig .",
    "the sample thickness is set @xmath97 , the dielectric permittivity is @xmath98 . for comparison ,",
    "the contribution of the lattice subsystem is shown separately . in accordance with the above",
    "said , the transmission spectra depend on the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "for the polarization parallel to the @xmath77 , @xmath30 fields , the cr is absent , however due to the opttr the electron contribution leads to an increase in the transmission coefficient ( curve 1 ) . for the perpendicular polarization ,",
    "the cr decreases the transmission ( curve 3 ) , while there is no the opttr contribution .",
    "the transmission spectra for an intermediate polarization are illustrated by curve 3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we present frequency dependencies of the loss / gain coefficients which append the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the loss / gain coefficient defines decrease / increase of the electromagnetic wave energy per unit time due to interaction with the electrons in the gan sample .",
    "one can see that characteristic for the cr decrease in the transmission coefficient is due to cyclotron absorption , while sample bleaching under opttr is relevant to a gain of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "the loss / gain effects and their dependencies on the wave polarization can be analyzed as follows .",
    "let @xmath99 be an angle between the electric vector @xmath100 and the @xmath11 axis .",
    "then , the time - averaged @xmath13 power density , that is received by electrons from the electromagnetic wave , reads : @xmath101   |\\bf{f}_{\\omega}|^2\\ , .",
    "\\label{power}\\ ] ] a negative value of @xmath102 indicates that an energy is transferred from the electrons to the electromagnetic field and vice - versa , a positive @xmath102 means that the energy of the wave is absorbed by the electron subsystem .    in the frequency window , where @xmath59 < 0 $ ] , the function @xmath103 can be negative in some interval of",
    "the polarization angles @xmath99 .",
    "the condition @xmath104 restricts the parameters @xmath105 , where the gain due to the opttr occurs .",
    "the actual space of these parameters can be illustrated in the @xmath106-plane , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for different values of the @xmath30 field . from this figure",
    "it is seen that for @xmath107 the gain occurs in the sufficiently wide angle sector , @xmath108 . with increasing @xmath30",
    "this angle sector becomes narrow .",
    "for example , at @xmath109 the gain is possible only at @xmath110 .",
    "thus , polarization dependencies of the gain effect are strongly affected by the cr .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated bulk - like gan subjected to electric and magnetic fields of moderate magnitudes , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . the parallel configuration of the electric and magnetic fields has been assumed . with the use of the monte carlo method , we have calculated steady state and high - frequency characteristics of the compensated gan at low temperatures .",
    "particularly , we have focused on the situation , when two resonances , the cyclotron resonance and the optical phonon transient - time resonance , become apparent simultaneously",
    ". we have calculated spectral dependencies of all components of the tensor of dynamical mobility in thz frequency range for different magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we have studied the cr for hot electrons , particularly , the electric field dependence of the cr broadening . for the analyzed range of the electric fields , where the streaming transport regime and the opttr effect are realized",
    ", we have found that the effective relaxation time , @xmath86 , determinative the broadening , correlates with the transit - time , @xmath87 , during which a ballistically accelerated electron reaches the energy of the optical phonon .",
    "that is , at very fast process of optical phonon emission , the cr broadening is determined rather by the dynamic characteristic , @xmath87 .",
    "we have determined spectral and field dependencies of the opttr .",
    "then , we have found that at electric fields of a few @xmath0 and magnetic fields of a few @xmath1 , well - developed cyclotron effect and optical phonon transient - time effects may coexist in the frequency range of @xmath113 : they can be observed simultaneously for the voigt configuration of the incident thz wave and the fields .",
    "we have shown that interplay of two resonances gives rise to specific spectra of thz transmission and absorption ( or gain ) , as well as characteristic polarization effects .",
    "it is important to make a few remarks on experimental observation of the discussed effects in the thz frequency range .",
    "the spectral measurements in the thz range can be performed by using recently developed _ detection methods _ for ultrashort electric signals and _ generation techniques _ for sub - picosecond transients of electric fields .",
    "the advanced ultrafast detection methods mainly relay on two techniques : photoconductive sampling  @xcite and electro - optic sampling  @xcite . by the use of femtosecond laser pulses with high repetition rates , these techniques allow for the direct measurement of electric transients with sub - picosecond time resolution . as for the generation techniques of sub - picosecond electric field transients ,",
    "the most studied are thz pulses emitted by transient photocurrents in a photoconductive switch and thz emission generated by nonlinear optical processes ( optical rectification , four - wave mixing , etc ) .",
    "additionally , time - resolved thz polarization and ellipsometry methods are available .",
    "the techniques of generation and detection of sub - picosecond electric field transients were applied to gan films to measure real and imaginary parts of the small signal conductivity under equilibrium conditions  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the discussed thz techniques are generally compatible with high - field measurement set - ups for magnetotransport in gan films / plates .",
    "particularly , these techniques can be applied to study the cr and opttr for the most interesting voigt configuration of the fields .",
    "concluding , the presented results show that low temperature investigation of gan samples in moderate electric and magnetic fields can provide a useful information on hot electron dynamic and relaxation , as well as reveal novel high frequency effects .",
