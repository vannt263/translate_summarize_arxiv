    "accretion disks around super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) have been predicted to be gravitationally unstable at large radii where they become too cool to resist self - gravity and can collapse to form stars or planets @xcite .",
    "there is now observational evidence that the two rings of young massive stars of size @xmath2 parsec in the centre of our galaxy were formed in situ @xcite , confirming the theoretical predictions . in our neighbouring andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) ,",
    "@xcite recently discovered a population of hot blue stars in a disk or ring of similar size , i.e. with radius of @xmath3 parsec .",
    "the significance of this discovery is that smbh in m31 is determined to be as massive as @xmath4 , or about 40 times more massive than the smbh in the milky way .",
    "this fact alone rules out ( eliot quataert , private communication ) the other plausible mechanism of forming stellar disks around smbhs , e.g. the massive cluster migration scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because the shear presented by the m31 black hole is much stronger than it is at same distance from , and its hard to see how a realistic star cluster would be able to survive that @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall attempt to understand what happens with the gaseous accretion disk around a smbh when the disk crosses the boundary of the marginal stability to self - gravitation @xcite and forms first stars .",
    "we find that in a range of distances from smbh , interestingly centered at @xmath1 parsec , creation of first low - mass proto - stars should lead to very rapid accretion on these stars .",
    "the respective accretion luminosity greatly exceeds the disk radiative cooling , thus heating and puffing the disk up .",
    "the new thermal equilibrium reached is that of a disk stable to self - gravity where further disk _ fragmentation _ is shut off .",
    "star formation is however continued via accretion onto the existing proto - stars , which then grow to large masses .",
    "we therefore predict that stellar disks around smbhs should generically posses top - heavy imf , as seems to be observed in  @xcite . in the discussion section",
    "we note three main differences between star formation process in a `` normal '' galactic environment and that in an accretion disk near a smbh .",
    "in this section we determine the structure of the marginally stable accretion disk , @xmath5 , i.e. the disk structure just before first gravitationally bound objects form .",
    "we envisage a situation in which the disk of a finite radius has been created by a `` mass deposition event '' on a time scale much shorter than the disk viscous time , but much longer than the local dynamical time , @xmath6 ( see below ) .",
    "such an event could be a collision of two large gas clouds al larger distances from the smbh , which cancelled most of the angular momentum of the gas , or cooling of a large quantity of hot gas that already had a specific angular momentum much smaller than that of the galaxy ( hot gas can be supported by its pressure in addition to rotation ) . in these conditions , it is reasonable to expect that the disk will settle into a local thermal equilibrium , in which the gas is heated via turbulence generated by self - gravitation @xcite and is cooled by radiation .",
    "the magnitude of viscosity @xmath7-parameter , and the disk cooling time , @xmath8 , are then coupled by @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the adiabatic index of gas .",
    "as we shall see below , for the parameters of interest , the evolution of the disk after star formation is turned on proceeds on a time scale again shorter than the local viscous time .",
    "therefore , below we assume that the disk is in the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium , but not in a steady accretion state , when the accretion rate @xmath11 const .",
    "we now estimate the conditions in the disk ( as a function of radius @xmath12 ) when it reaches surface density large enough to suffer local gravitational collapse .",
    "star formation is a local process in this approach , and different rings in the disk could become gravitationally unstable at different times .",
    "the appropriate accretion disk equations for @xmath13 have been discussed by many authors ( see references in the introduction ) .",
    "the hydrostatic balance condition yields @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the total pressure and gas density , @xmath18 is the disk scale height and @xmath19 is the keplerian angular frequency at radius @xmath12 from the black hole . @xmath20 here is the stellar velocity dispersion just outside the smbh radius of influence , i.e. where the total stellar mass becomes larger than @xmath21 . using equation [ cs ]",
    ", the disk midplane density is determined by inversion of the definition of @xcite @xmath22-parameter : @xmath23    to solve for temperature of the disk , we should specify heating and cooling rates per unit area of the disk .",
    "the former is coupled to the rate of the mass transfer through the disk , @xmath24 : @xmath25 the accretion rate is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the disk surface density . the kinematic viscosity @xmath28 in terms of the @xcite prescription is @xmath29 .",
    "marginally stable self - gravitating disks are believed to have @xmath30 @xcite generated by spiral density waves .",
    "the cooling rate of the disk ( per side per unit surface area ) is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the optical depth of the disk .",
    "this expression allows one to switch smoothly from the optically thick @xmath33 to the optically thin @xmath34 radiative cooling limits .",
    "we approximate the opacity coefficient @xmath35 following table 3 in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "for the problem at hand , it is just the first four entries in the table are important as disk solutions with @xmath36 k are thermally unstable(see also appendix b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since opacity rises as quickly as @xmath37 in that region .",
    "this rather simple approximation to the opacities is justified for the order of magnitude parameter study that we intend to perform here . in addition",
    ", we set a minimum temperature of @xmath38 k for our solutions . even without any gas accretion",
    ", realistic gas disks near galactic centres will be heated by external stellar radiation to effective temperatures of this order or slightly larger .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper do not sensitively depend on the exact value of the minimum temperature or exact opacity law .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the resulting disk `` mass '' defined as @xmath39 and the midplane temperature ( multiplied by @xmath40 ) .",
    "the lower panel of the figure shows two estimates of mass of the first fragments in the disk .",
    "different authors estimate the volumes of the first unstable fragments slightly differently , but the reasonable range seems to be from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the two curves in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] should then encompass the reasonable outcomes , from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . from the figure ,",
    "the fragment mass is , in the observationally interesting range of radii , i.e. @xmath45 pc , @xmath46 , and hence if disk were to rapidly and completely collapse into clumps of mass of this order , one would expect low - mass stars or even giant planets to dominate the mass spectrum of collapsed objects .",
    "numerical simulations with a constant cooling time show ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that if the disk cooling time is at the threshold for the fragmentation to take place , then the first gas clumps will grow very rapidly by inelastic collisions with other clumps , possibly until they reach the isolation mass @xmath47 @xcite . if this is the case , then the main point of our paper",
    " that stars born in an accretion disk near a smbh are massive on average  is proven , because the isolation mass can be hundreds to as much as @xmath48 solar masses @xcite .",
    "however we suspect that @xcite simulations yielded no further gravitational collapse of the gas clumps precisely because the cooling time were kept constant . as the clump density increases , the clump free - fall time decreases as @xmath49 , and",
    "hence the clumps could not collapse as they could not cool rapidly enough .",
    "it is quite likely that had the cooling time _ inside the clumps _ were allowed to decrease as the clumps get hotter , the clumps would collapse before they agglomerate into larger ones .",
    "we shall now assume that gravitational instabilities in the @xmath5 disc resulted in the formation of first proto - stars . according to the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : mfirst ] , we conservatively assume that these proto - stars are low mass objects , and show that in certain conditions even a small admixture of these to the accretion disk may significantly affect its evolution .      as the stars are born out of the gas in a turbulent disc , we assume that the initial stellar velocities are the sum of the bulk circular keplerian velocity @xmath50 in the azimuthal direction and a random component with three dimensional dispersion magnitude @xmath51 .",
    "this also implies that at least initially stellar disk height - scale , @xmath52 , is roughly the same as that of the gas disk , @xmath18 .",
    "proto - stars would interact by direct collisions and n - body scatterings between themselves and also via dynamical friction with the gas .",
    "the rate for proto - stellar collisions , @xmath53 , is the sum of two terms , the geometric cross - section of the colliding stars and the gravitational focusing term ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "one can show that @xmath54 $ ] , from which it is obvious that collisions are unimportant as long as the collision radius , @xmath55 ( the proto - star radius ) , is much smaller than the disk height scale . in all of the cases considered below this",
    "will be satisfied by few orders of magnitude , therefore we shall neglect direct collisions .",
    "the n - body evolution of the system of stars immersed into a gas disk is described by @xcite @xmath56\\ ; \\label{dsnet}\\ ] ] where @xmath57  few is the coulomb logarithm for stellar collisions , @xmath58  few is the drag coefficient for star - gas interactions @xcite , @xmath59 is one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath60 is the stellar surface density .",
    "therefore , as long as the gas density @xmath61 , stellar velocity dispersion can not grow as it is damped by interactions with the gas too efficiently . recalling that @xmath62",
    ", we find that in this situation @xmath63 thus , initially , when @xmath64 , stars are embedded in the gaseous disk and form a disk geometrically thinner than that of the gas .",
    "however , if stellar surface density grows and approaches that of the gaseous component , then the stellar velocity dispersion will run away .",
    "the stars then form a geometrically thicker disk ( numerical simulations , to be reported in a future paper , confirm these predictions ) .",
    "galaxy disks apparently operate in this regime , with molecular gas having a much smaller scale height than stars .",
    "since the stars remain embedded in the disk , they will continue to gain mass via gas accretion .",
    "such accretion has been previously considered by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the accretion rate is @xmath65\\ ; , \\label{mdot}\\ ] ] where the accretion rates in the brackets are the bondi , the hill and the eddington limit , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is calculated based on the thomson opacity of free electrons instead of dust opacity because we assume that the cooler regions of accretion flow onto the star are shielded from the stellar radiation by the inner , hotter accretion flow @xcite : @xmath66 year@xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "presence of the stars will lead to additional disc heating via radiation and outflows , and n - body scattering .",
    "the energy liberation rate per surface area due to n - body interactions is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for the first term only in equation [ dsnet ] .",
    "internal disk heating with the @xmath7-parameter equal to unity is @xmath71 comparing the stellar n - body heating with that of the internal disk heating , we have @xmath72 we have assumed above that toomre - parameter @xmath13 when the stars just appear in the disk , and that @xmath73 , i.e. that we are within the smbh sphere of influence . considering this expression for typical numbers , one notices that n - body heating is never important for large black holes and disks with finite disk thickness , i.e. at distances of tens of parsec and further away , but it may become important for smaller smbh such as  and sub - parsec distances .",
    "radiative internal output of the stars is another source of disk heating .",
    "we shall use a very simple parameterisation for the internal stellar luminosity as a function of mass , @xmath74 . to this radiative output",
    "we should also add the accretion luminosity : @xmath75 the sum should not exceed the eddington limit , @xmath76  erg s@xmath67 , and hence our prescription is @xmath77\\ ; , \\label{lstar}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the eddington limit with thomson opacity @xmath79 .",
    "the radiative disk heating per unit surface area is then @xmath80",
    "as equation [ rho ] suggests , accretion disks on parsec scales are as dense as @xmath81 particles @xmath82 , which is multiple orders of magnitude denser than the densest gas in molecular clouds far from galactic centers .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the first proto - stars will be accreting at super - eddington rates , typically .",
    "the corresponding accretion luminosity heating ( equation [ qstar ] with @xmath83 ) is @xmath84 at the same time , the disk intrinsic heating at @xmath5 is , from equation [ hvisc ] , @xmath85^{3/2 } \\ ; \\hbox{erg s}^{-1 } \\hbox{cm}^{-2 } \\ ; , \\label{qself}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in units of g @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the disk temperature in units of 100 k. we see that even a very small admixture of proto - stars ( @xmath90 ) accreting at eddington accretion rates will result in stellar heating much exceeding the intrinsic one . since the disk thermal equilibrium is established on time scales comparable to the disk dynamical time , the disk will heat up at a constant @xmath86 until its radiative losses can balance the accretion luminosity .",
    "this will increase the disk sound speed and the @xcite q - parameter _ above unity_. therefore , the accretion feedback will stop further fragmentation from happening .",
    "the stars embedded into the disk will however continue to gain mass at very high rates .",
    "this should lead to a top - heavy initial mass function for the stars .",
    "note that a similar conclusion has been already reached by @xcite who considered rather later stages in the evolution of a more massive agn disk , when the high mass stars were turned into stellar mass black holes .",
    "he pointed out that accretion onto these embedded black holes will likely heat the disk , driving the @xcite @xmath22-parameter above unity for radii somewhat smaller than a parsec .",
    "we shall first consider the case of  for which the mass of the smbh is estimated to be @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "for the particular example , we shall accept that @xmath92 and that the initial masses of proto - stars are @xmath93 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the disk midplane temperature before the stars are introduced ( solid ) and after ( dashed ) versus radius @xmath12 .",
    "temperature of the gas increases for radii @xmath94 parsec .",
    "@xcite q - parameter after the stars are introduced is plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "@xmath22 indeed becomes greater than unity in the same radial range , thus shutting off further gravitational collapse .",
    "the radial range where the proto - stars shut off further fragmentation is rather insensitive to assumptions of our model .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the @xmath22-parameter after stars are introduced into the @xmath95 gaseous disk for  case but with varying assumptions . in particular , the solid curve is the same as that in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , lower panel ; the dotted one is calculated for the opacity coefficient @xmath35 multiplied arbitrarily by 3 , whereas for the dashed one @xmath35 was divided by @xmath96 .",
    "these arbitrary changes were introduced to estimate the degree to which the results are dependent on the ( uncertain ) opacity detail . finally , the dot - dashed curve is calculated assumed the standard opacity but increasing the proto - stellar mass to @xmath97 and stellar surface density @xmath87 to 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the stellar heating is then more pronounced and a larger area of the marginally stable disk can be affected .",
    "we also consider the case of a more massive black hole , in particular we set @xmath98 , as thought to be the case for m31 .",
    "figure [ fig : m31 ] shows the disk temperature structure ( upper panel ) before the collapse ( dashed ) and after the collapse . note that these curves are almost identical to those for  case except for a general shift to larger radii .",
    "this shift is about a factor of 3 only , which should not be surprising given that in the standard accretion disk theory @xcite the midplane disk temperature is a very weak function of the central object mass .",
    "in this semi - analytical paper , we studied the `` first minutes '' of an accretion disk around a super - massive black hole after the disk became unstable and formed first stars .",
    "we assumed that the disk accumulated its mass over time scales much longer than the local dynamical time , and is thus in a thermal equilibrium before the gravitational collapse . in this case , irrespectively of the typical mass of the first proto - stars , even a 0.1% admixture ( by mass ) of these significantly alters the thermal energy balance of the disk .",
    "the proto - stars accrete gas from the surrounding disk at very high ( super - eddington ) rates at a range of disk radii .",
    "the accretion luminosity of these stars is sufficient to heat the disk up in that range of radii to the point where it becomes stable to self - gravity ( @xmath99 ) , which then shuts off further fragmentation of the disk .",
    "the proto - stars already present in the disc would however continue to gain mass at very high rates . quite generally ,",
    "then , an average star created in such a disk will be a massive one , in stark contrast to the typical galactic star formation event .",
    "significance of accretion feedback onto embedded _",
    "stellar mass black holes _ for accretion disks near galactic centres was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "he noted that the accretion disks can be stabilised by the feedback out to radius of about one parsec , in good agreement with our results .",
    "since the eddington luminosity depends only on the disk opacity and the mass of the central object , it is then not really surprising that the feedback is effective for accretion onto stars as well .",
    "the range of radial distances from the smbh where this effect operates is a slow function of the smbh mass , and is typically from a fraction of 0.1 parsec to a few parsec , with the peak of the effect taking place at @xmath1 parsec .",
    "the reason why the feedback is only effective in a range of radii is that at large radii , i.e. tens of parsec , the gas density in the disk drops significantly so that accretion rates onto the proto - stars become much smaller than the respective eddington - limited rates . at radii",
    "much smaller than @xmath100 parsec , the intrinsic disk heating ( equation [ qself ] ) becomes very large .",
    "a related point is that steady - state constant accretion rate disk models show that there is always the minimum radius where star formation becomes impossible as @xmath99 there ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of the minimum distance where star formation should be expected is comparable to the minimum radius for which we predict favourable conditions for development of a top - heavy imf .",
    "we suggest that the uncommonly effective feedback from star formation on low - mass proto - stars may be relevant for the formation of rings of massive stars observed in the galactic centre and in the nucleus of m31 .",
    "in particular , @xcite have shown from two completely independent lines of evidence that the imf of stellar disks in the galactic centre must have been very top - heavy , with the mass of solar - type stars accounting for no more than @xmath101% of the total , the remainder being in the @xmath102 stars .",
    "the insensitivity of our results to details of the model and the smbh mass suggest that the imf of stars born inside accretion disks near galactic centers may be generically top - heavy , which would have long - ranging consequences for the accretion theory in agn .      in this paper we concentrated on the growth of proto - stellar mass via accretion of gas .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : stars ] , in certain conditions the mass of gas clumps before they collapse to form a star may be much higher than the jeans mass . this would only increase the expected final mass of a typical star in the disk .",
    "the same is true for direct collisions of proto - stars , the other channel via which proto - stars may grow ( see  [ sec : coupling ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have here limited the rate at which the proto - star would grow to the eddington accretion rate onto a star .",
    "this is important if the rate at which the gas is captured in the sphere of influence of the proto - star , the hill or the bondi radius , whichever is smaller , exceeds the eddington accretion rate .",
    "it is possible that in reality the excess gas settles into a rotationally supported `` proto - stellar '' disk from which further generations of stars may be born @xcite .",
    "it is not obviously clear whether this effect would increase the average mass of the stars or would rather decrease it .",
    "on the one hand , fragmentation of the proto - stellar disk may give rise to many low mass stars .",
    "on the other , though , these stars may be then driven into the central more massive star by the continuing gas accretion , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in the latter case the central star may in fact grow faster than the eddington accretion rate .    on the balance ,",
    "we believe that the main conclusion of our work , e.g. the unusually high ( perhaps dominant ) fraction of the total mass going into creation of high mass stars as opposed to low mass stars , may be rather robust .",
    "one clear exception to this will be a very rapid ( dynamical ) gravitational collapse of a disc .",
    "for example , when a large quantity of gas ( compared to the minimum needed for the disk to become self - gravitating , see figure 1 ) cools off very rapidly and settles into a disc configuration , and the cooling time is shorter than dynamical time , the disc will break into self - gravitating low mass objects before it can establish thermal balance ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we deliberately stayed away here from discussing the much more complicated question of the eventual disk evolution .",
    "the answer depends not only on the initial radial structure of the disk but also on how the disk is fed with gas after it crossed the self - gravity instability threshold .",
    "we shall investigate these issues in our future work ( note that thompson et al .",
    "2005 recently developed a model for kilo - parsec scale star - forming disks in ultra - luminous galaxies ) .",
    "it is instructive to emphasise the differences in star formation rates near a smbh and in a galaxy .",
    "consider the relevant gravitational collapse time scales @xmath103 .",
    "for accretion disks around the smbh , this is @xmath104 , which is shorter than the eddington limit doubling time of @xmath105 a thousand years .",
    "compare this time with the free - fall time for a molecular cloud of mass @xmath106 and size of 1 parsec : @xmath107 years . clearly , then , an average accretion rate in the galactic environment is orders of magnitude below the eddington limit , and no significant radiation feedback should be expected from _ low mass _ proto - stars .",
    "the latter can then form in great numbers with little damage to the rest of the cloud , unlike in the case of a massive disk .",
    "another significant qualitative difference is that the escape temperatures , @xmath108 , are vastly different near a smbh and inside a molecular cloud .",
    "for the former , it is typically in the range of @xmath109 k , whereas for the latter it is only @xmath105 few @xmath110 k. hence , while photo - ionizing feedback from massive stars may unbind most of the gas in a molecular cloud , stopping not only further fragmentation but also further accretional growth of proto - stars , in smbh disks the effect is local ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in particular",
    ", it simply increases the disk scale - height until the gravity of the smbh ( which increases as @xmath111 for thin accretion disks , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is strong enough to hold the gas in place . in other words ,",
    "accretion or any other star formation feedback in a disk environment may be strong enough to prevent further disk fragmentation but not the growth of the existing proto - stars .",
    "third important difference is geometry .",
    "most stars in a molecular cloud move on orbits different from those of the gas , as the latter is influenced by both gravity and pressure forces whereas stars obey only the gravity . hence the gas and the stars may be separated out in space , terminating accretion onto the stars .",
    "in contrast , as is well known from the standard accretion theory @xcite , gas pressure forces are very small compared to the smbh gravity for thin gas disks in galactic centers , and so both stars and gas follow essentially circular keplerian orbits around the smbh @xcite .",
    "therefore the stars are always not too far away from the gas and hence have a much better chance to gain more mass by accretion .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the birth of even a small number ( by mass fraction ) of low - mass proto - stars inside a marginally stable accretion disk near a galactic center will unleash a very strong thermal feedback onto the gaseous disk . in a sub - parsec range of radii",
    ", the disk will be heated and thickened so that it becomes stable to further fragmentation",
    ". the feedback however is not strong enough to unbind the gas from the deep potential well of the smbh . therefore , while the feedback stops a further disk fragmentation , accretional growth of stars already present in the disk proceed .",
    "quite generically , this scenario should lead to the average star created in the smbh accretion disk being `` obese '' compared to its galactic cousins .",
