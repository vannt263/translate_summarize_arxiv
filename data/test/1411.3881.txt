    "filtering of optical signals plays an important role in experimental quantum optics .",
    "the optical field under investigation always includes unwanted components , or noise , contributing to the signal due to the imperfections and losses in constituents of the optical setup or due to the environment surrounding this setup . from the quantum optical point of view , it is impossible to have no loss at all  @xcite .",
    "the task of the experimenter is to minimize the inaccuracies , caused by the presence of such noise , by proper filtering .",
    "optical filtering is a process in which certain spectral parts of the signal are suppressed due to convolution with a filter function , which represents the selecting device .",
    "the most common filters are glasses , specifically designed to transmit some definite wavelengths , which are placed in the input ports of the detectors  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , electric current filters can be used in the detectors output channels  @xcite .",
    "these filters are realized mainly as simple electronic pass - band filters , which can be easier controlled than optical filters . from the viewpoint of classical optics the application of both filtering techniques",
    "is equivalent .",
    "thus electronic filtering techniques have been applied in many modern experimental setups  @xcite .",
    "this does not only include optical experiments , but virtually every signal analysis in which a frequency dependent input is transformed into an electric current signal , e.g. in geophysics  @xcite , acoustics  @xcite , and electronic devices themselves  @xcite .    in the quantum domain",
    "the equivalence of optical and electronic filtering is by no means obvious . on one hand",
    "the disparity arises since the relation between the optical and the photoelectric current spectra strongly depends on the statistical properties of the optical signal field to be measured  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the filtering convolutions occur at very different stages of the light - analyzing process .",
    "optical filters act on the quantum light itself , before the detector records the radiation field . as a consequence , such a filtering process unavoidably introduces additional quantum noise effects into the signal before it is measured .",
    "the current filtering , is a purely classical procedure , which is implemented after the completion of the detection process of the radiation .",
    "hence the current filtering does not add quantum noise to the data .",
    "however , when broadband fields are measured , in general the detectors may only integrate over parts of the radiation spectrum , so that information may be lost before the currents are spectrally analyzed .",
    "thus , it is a cumbersome problem to identify the optimal strategy for spectral measurements of quantum light fields of a broad spectral bandwidths .",
    "it is noteworthy that the optimal type of filtering may also depend on the physical situation under study .",
    "for example , the optical spectral filtering may be the preferential choice for the extraction of entangled photon pairs , which could be generated in the biexciton - radiative cascade process  @xcite or by v - type three - level systems in microcavities  @xcite .",
    "however , electronic photocurrent filters have been useful for the measurements of the signal to noise ratio of light with a gaussian statistics  @xcite and for the quadrature - fluctuation spectroscopy with squeezed light  @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall focus on spectral correlation measurements , for which both types of filtering may be applied .",
    "the theory of passive optical filters and their influence on correlation properties of filtered quantum light was developed in ref .",
    "this topic has become of interest more recently since methods were developed and set up to measure arbitrary field correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical concepts , however , have proven difficult to analyze for higher order moments . therefore , alternative descriptions have also been studied  @xcite . based on",
    "the above argumentation the current - filtering procedure includes the implicit filtering by the detector , which acts in a similar manner as a spectral filter , as well as the classical filtering of the current signals after detection .",
    "the latter is a purely classical process .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compare the spectral measurements of broadband radiation , based on optical and electronic filtering .",
    "we provide a consistent theoretical approach to treat the quantum noise effects in both techniques .",
    "furthermore , detecting normally and time ordered field correlation functions via balanced correlation homodyning with filters preserves the ordering from the original fields .",
    "thus , the filtered fields can be used to detect nonclassicality in the same way as for the original fields . to illustrate the results",
    ", we analyze the elementary example of the squeezing spectrum of the atomic resonance fluorescence .",
    "our finding is that the spectral filtering light limits the ability to detect the squeezing to a greater extent than the current filtering , making the latter preferential for this setup .",

    "[ spectral - chapter ] we will describe the techniques for measuring the spectral correlation functions of an optically filtered radiation field . in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "from a mathematical point of view , the intrinsic spectral properties of a light field under study are recovered by a fourier analysis of the signals obtained in the time domain . in classical optics",
    "this procedure is straightforward . in quantum optics , however , the application of the spectral analysis is a more sophisticated problem , because of the time- and normal - ordering prescriptions of the field operators in the measured correlation functions together with the related quantum noise effects  @xcite .    in order to recover the information about the spectral properties of measured light , one may send the light beam through a frequency sensitive device , before detection .",
    "in classical physics , the spectrally filtered field is expressed by a convolution integral of the signal field with a filter response function .",
    "the quantum theory of photodetection of optically filtered light contains additional difficulties , due to the quantum noise effects introduced by the filtering procedure  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a careful analysis of correlation properties must be performed for the filtered optical radiation fields .    in ref .",
