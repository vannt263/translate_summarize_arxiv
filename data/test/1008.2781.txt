    "in the absence of an applied voltage , an induced electrical current rapidly decays due to dissipation processes . in normal ( not superconducting ) metal rings",
    "it typically dies out within the relaxation time of order @xmath0 s. however , if a radius of the ring is small enough ( below microns ) and temperature of the system is below @xmath1 k , quantum effects start to play a distinct role . under right circumstances electrons in the ring",
    "are able to preserve its coherence which in turn results in the persistent ( dissipationless ) current induced by the static applied magnetic field .",
    "the existence of persistent currents in metallic rings was predicted by hund in 1938 @xcite .",
    "more than 30 years later bloch @xcite and kulik @xcite confirmed this prediction by means of quantum  mechanical models .",
    "the strong interest in physics of mesoscopic rings arose after the 1983 paper @xcite where the authors showed that persistent currents could flow even in the presence of disorder .",
    "experiments on persistent currents have produced a number of confusing results in apparent contradiction with theory and even amongst the experiments themselves ( e.g. the response of rings was 10 - 200 larger than theoretically predicted ) @xcite .",
    "we could observe persistent controversy on persistent currents for nearly twenty years .",
    "recently , two groups @xcite have developed new different techniques which allow to make measurements a full order of magnitude more precise than any previous attempts .",
    "both experiments confirm to a high degree the physics theory regarding the behavior of persistent currents .",
    "the group of k. moler @xcite has employed a scanning technique ( a squid microscope ) and measured the magnetic response of 33 individual mesoscopic gold rings .",
    "each ring was scanned individually , unlike past experiments on persistent currents conducted by other groups . in total",
    "the rings were scanned approximately 10 million times .",
    "the team of j. harris @xcite has developed an alternative measurement scheme .",
    "the aluminum rings have been deposited on a cantilever used as a torque magnetometer whose vibration frequency can be precisely monitored . from the frequency shift caused by the magnetic flux , the researchers could deduce the current with a precision of two orders of magnitude greater than it was possible in the past .",
    "they have studied several different cantilevers decorated with a single aluminium ring or arrays of hundreds or thousands of identical aluminium rings .",
    "the rings on different cantilevers had radiuses of 308 - 793 nanometers .",
    "persistent currents are highly sensitive to a variety of factors .",
    "it is clearly visible in experimental data shown in panel ( b ) of fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite : for nominally identical samples the observed response is paramagnetic ( e.g. for the ring 1 ) or diamagnetic ( e.g. for the ring 2 ) . here",
    ", we propose several possible mechanisms for controlling the response of the metallic mesoscopic rings and determine the conditions for which the transition from paramagnetic to diamagnetic current is able to occur .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the section [ 2fm ] ,",
    "we start with the presentation of the model for the flux dynamics in the rings . next , in the section [ results ] ,",
    "we identify the operating conditions on which similar rings can exhibit opposite responses .",
    "we finalize the paper with conclusions in the section 4 .",
    "at low temperature , small normal metal rings threaded by a magnetic flux can display persistent and non - dissipative currents carried by phase - coherent electrons .",
    "the circumference of the ring should be smaller than the electron s phase coherence length .",
    "this typically limits the sample size to below micrometers and the temperature to below 1 k. however , at temperature @xmath2 , a part of electrons looses its phase - coherence due to thermal fluctuations and constitutes a dissipative ohmic current associated with the resistance @xmath3 .",
    "the actual magnetic flux @xmath4 induced by the current flowing in the ring is given by the relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic flux generated by the external constant magnetic field , @xmath7 denotes the total current flowing in the ring and @xmath8 stands for the self  inductance of the ring .",
    "dynamics of the magnetic flux @xmath4 in such a system is modeled by the dimensionless langevin - type equation @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rescaled magnetic flux and @xmath11 is the flux quantum .",
    "the rescaled time @xmath12 , where the characteristic time @xmath13 is the inductive time of the ring . for a typical mesoscopic ring ,",
    "@xmath14 is in the picosecond range .",
    "the function @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xcite @xmath17 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the maximal persistent current at zero temperature . in the mechanical context , @xmath20 could be interpreted as an effective potential . the temperature dependent amplitudes @xmath21 are determined by the relation @xcite @xmath22 with the dimensionless temperature @xmath23 , where the characteristic temperature @xmath24 is proportional to the energy gap @xmath25 at the fermi surface .",
    "the persistent current strongly depends on the parity of the number of coherent electrons .",
    "it is taken into account by assigning the probability @xmath26 of an even number of the coherent electrons .",
    "then the corresponding probability of an odd number of the coherent electrons is given by @xmath27 .",
    "thermal equilibrium fluctuations are modeled by @xmath28correlated gaussian white noise @xmath29 of zero mean .",
    "classically this situation holds true in many cases .",
    "when temperature is lowered , however , the quantum nature of thermal fluctuations becomes important and starts to play a role .",
    "therefore the standard diffusion coefficient @xmath30 ( @xmath31 denotes the boltzmann constant ) is modified due to quantum effects like tunnelling , quantum reflections and purely quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the modified diffusion coefficient @xmath32 assumes the form @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 , the elementary magnetic flux energy @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the ratio of two characteristic energies .",
    "the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath37 . the dimensionless quantum correction parameter @xcite @xmath38 , \\quad \\lambda_0=\\frac { \\hbar r}{\\pi\\phi_0 ^ 2 } ,   \\quad \\epsilon = \\frac{\\hbar/2\\pi cr}{k_bt^*},\\ ] ] where the psi function @xmath39 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function , @xmath40 is the euler gamma constant and @xmath41 is capacitance of the system related to charging effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 characterizes quantum corrections to classical thermal fluctuations and can be formulated as the difference between quantum and classical fluctuations of the dimensionless flux , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes thermal equilibrium average , the subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 refer to quantum and classical cases , respectively .",
    "let us remember that the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 can not be negative and therefore the parameter @xmath42 has to be chosen small enough to ensure its non - negativeness for any argument . because in eq .",
    "( [ qov ] ) the noise term contains the multiplicative white noise @xmath29 , it is important to stress that eq .",
    "( [ qov ] ) has to be interpreted in the ito sense @xcite .",
    "therefore the corresponding fokker ",
    "planck equation for the time evolution of the probability density @xmath48 reads @xcite @xmath49 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 }    \\left [ d_{\\lambda}(x ) p(x , t ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] the average stationary dimensionless current @xmath50 flowing in the ring can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ ll1 ] ) : @xmath51 and the average stationary magnetic flux @xmath52 is calculated from the relation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a stationary probability density being a solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) for @xmath55 and zero stationary probability current .",

    "when thermal fluctuations have to be considered as quantum fluctuations , the stationary state is still a thermal equilibrium state but now described by the non - boltzmann distribution ( [ ps ] ) with the @xmath62-dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "we are interested in the current - flux characteristics , i.e. in dependence of the stationary current @xmath63 on the applied magnetic flux @xmath64 . to this aim",
    "we exploit eqs .",
    "( [ ia])-([psi ] ) .",
    "note that the external flux @xmath64 enters eq .",
    "( [ ia ] ) and the remaining equations via the potential ( [ v(x ) ] ) which occurs both in the diffusion function @xmath65 and the generalized thermodynamical potential @xmath58 .",
    "because the persistent current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux , we consider the current - flux characteristics on the unit interval of @xmath64 . we present four visually similar sets of the current - flux characteristics with various set - ups to demonstrate sensitivity of the persistent currents to some subtle effects .",
    "it could explain the different response of the nominally identical metal rings to the magnetic flux presented in the recent experimental work @xcite .",
    "the measured persistent current of 15 nominally identical rings with radius @xmath66 m exhibits both the paramagnetic and diamagnetic response . in panel ( b ) of fig . 2 in ref.@xcite",
    ", one can easily notice that in the linear response regime , i.e. for values of the external flux close to zero , the susceptibility defined as the ratio of the average persistent current to the external flux has sometimes positive slope indicating the paramagnetic current ( see the current for the rings 1 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 in fig .",
    "2(b ) in @xcite ) and sometimes negative slope exhibiting the diamagnetic response ( see the current for the rings 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 in fig .",
    "2(b ) in @xcite ) .    .",
    "in the panel ( a ) we show current  flux characteristics in the classical regime for three different temperatures @xmath67 .",
    "panel ( b ) presents also the classical regime for three different structure constants @xmath68 .",
    "panel ( c ) exhibits again the persistent current for ring working in the classical regime for three values of the probability @xmath69 of an even number of coherent electrons in the ring .",
    "finally panel ( d ) reveals the influence of the quantum parameter @xmath70 ( indicating classical regime ) , @xmath71 ( quantum regime ) .",
    "blue ( solid ) lines mark the paramagnetic response to the external stimulus , green ( dashed ) lines denote the situation where the magnetic susceptibility is zero and finally red ( dashed  dotted ) lines indicate the diamagnetic susceptibility of the normal metal mesoring around zero external magnetic flux ( see insets for details ) .",
    "the parameters not given explicitly are set as follows : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 . ]",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrate possible current - flux characteristics .",
    "all parameters are chosen arbitrarily as we do nt aim to compare our results with the experimental data .",
    "the goal of this work is rather to constitute possible mechanisms responsible for diamagnetic or paramagnetic responses .",
    "neverthless , all curves corresponding to the paramagnetic currents ( blue solid lines ) in all panels look very similar to the experimental curve shown in figure s6(a ) in the supporting online material @xcite of the paper @xcite .    in the panel ( a )",
    "we depict the current  flux characteristics in the regime of classical thermal fluctuations ( i.e. when @xmath76 ) for three different temperatures . for the lowest temperature @xmath77 ( blue solid line ) the situation reveals the paramagnetic response of the ring to the applied magnetic flux . for the higher temperature @xmath78 ( red dashed  dotted line )",
    "the response is diamagnetic .",
    "the cross  temperature below which the response is paramagnetic and above which is diamagnetic was recognized numerically at the value of @xmath79 ( see green dashed line and the inset of the panel ( a ) for details ) .",
    "panel ( b ) presents the ring reaction to the external stimulus for three values of the structure parameter @xmath80 .",
    "it stands for the ratio of the two characteristic energies , the thermal energy @xmath81 to the magnetic energy @xmath82 .",
    "it is instructive to define @xmath83 in the alternative way as @xmath84 . at the value of @xmath85",
    "the response is paramagnetic ( blue solid line ) , for @xmath86 it is diamagnetic ( red dashed - dotted line ) and again we have numerically identified the cross  value at the level of @xmath87 ( green dashed line ) .",
    "we note that the ratio of two parameters @xmath88 describes the physical properties of the metal ring @xcite . here",
    "@xmath89 is the elastic mean free path of the electron in the ring and @xmath90 stands for the circumference of the ring . for the multichannel rings",
    "the above ratio is greater than one for the ballistic regime and smaller than one in the diffusive one . in the presented collection of the parameters the cross  value of the para to ",
    "diamagnetic response lies slightly below the value of unity , i.e. at @xmath91 .",
    "it means that this border value lies in the diffusive regime and all rings designated by the higher values of @xmath83 showing the diamagnetic susceptibility will also lie in the same diffusive regime .",
    "it is well know that the most straightforward way of turning the susceptibility from diamagnetic to paramagnetic is to change the probability @xmath92 of an even number of coherent electrons in the ring . in the panel ( c ) we present the current for three different rings with probabilities @xmath93 ( blue solid line ) , @xmath94",
    "( green dashed line ) and @xmath95 ( red dashed  dotted line ) exhibiting the paramagnetic , zero and diamagnetic susceptibility , respectively .    in the last panel ( d )",
    "we focus on the influence of quantumness of thermal fluctuations on persistent currents .",
    "the comparison of the classical thermal fluctuations with @xmath96 and corresponding paramagnetic current ( blue solid line ) with two values of the non  zero quantum noise parameter @xmath97 exhibiting zero magnetic susceptibility ( green dashed line ) and @xmath98 with diamagnetic response ( red dashed  dotted line ) is presented . as shown , the sign of the current in the vicinity of zero magnetic field can be easily affected by small perturbation of the quantum correction parameter @xmath99 .",
    "we have proposed four various mechanisms that can lead to either diamagnetic or paramagnetic currents in the metal rings .",
    "two of them are related to the physical properties of the metal rings .",
    "these are the structure parameter @xmath83 together with the probability @xmath92 of an even number of coherent electrons in the ring .",
    "another two can be adjusted by tuning the temperature of the system . in the experiment @xcite ,",
    "the temperature uncertainty is @xmath100 @xcite . in all presented cases ,",
    "the small change of the control parameter causes the reversal of the susceptibility - from paramagnetic to diamagnetic ones or _",
    "vice versa_. in the nowadays experiments on the mesoscopic rings it is impossible to justify which system parameters are responsible for the observed responses .",
    "the fact that the scientists are able to perform the measurements on single separated rings is a great success and a milestone in the present state  of  the  art . in the near future",
