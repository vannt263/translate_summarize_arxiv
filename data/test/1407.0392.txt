    "the range of the limit of cosmos_9 caused by the variation of dust temperature shown with the blue double - headed arrow is also higher than the expected gas - to - dust ratio at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , no significant redshift evolution of the gas - to - dust ratio for massive star - forming galaxies is seen up to @xmath2 at least for galaxies with solar metallicity .",
    "one possible cause for the non - evolving gas - to - dust ratio is that star - forming galaxies acquired the large dust mass more rapidly . in the model by @xcite ,",

    "figure [ fig : gdr ] shows the results for the timescale of @xmath132 , but with the shorter time scale , the dust mass becomes larger rapidly and the gas - to - dust ratio in higher redshift is close to the local value . in fact , @xcite calculated the evolution of dust - to - gas ratio with shorter time scale of @xmath133 , and the result seems to be consistent with our results ( dashed lines in figure [ fig : gdr ] ) .",
    "shattering of dust grains accelerates the growth of the dust mass , and the rapid increase of the dust mass can be realized in an earlier epoch of galaxy evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "another possible cause is the presence of the gas outflow from a galaxy during the process of galaxy evolution , which is not included in the model by @xcite .",
    "gas outflows are observed in many galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , dust is also expelled from galaxies by supernovae or radiation pressure , which is suggested from the distribution of dust emissions in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the outflow presumably does not drive gas outside a galaxy selectively ; therefore it may be difficult to reduce the gas - to - dust ratio effectively .",
    "since we selected the galaxies which are clearly detected with spire , we should be careful that our sample galaxies may be biased toward sources with large dust mass ; the small gas - to - dust ratio may be due to our target selection .",
    "observations of molecular gas and dust emission for the star - forming galaxies with lower flux densities in far - infrared are desirable to examine the evolution of gas - to - dust ratio more robustly .",
