    "the development of a kinetic theory of granular gases , collections of large numbers of inelastically colliding particles , has proven to be a very challenging undertaking . while the equilibrium properties of elastically colliding gases",
    "are relatively well understood , the introduction of physically relevant levels of dissipation change the dynamics dramatically .",
    "considerable progress has been made in understanding the behavior of freely cooling granular gases , where the energy lost to collisions is not replaced . in order to model a variety of industrial processes where energy is added to the grains to enhance mixing and transport , a kinetic theory of forced granular gases is required . by analogy with the theory of equilibrium fluids , the goal is to solve a boltzmann - like equation for the relevant ` microscopic ' statistical distribution functions describing the behavior of individual grains .",
    "the rate at which energy is put into the fluctuating velocities is balanced by the rate at which it is lost in collisions . `",
    "macroscopic ' transport coefficients , relating average fluxes ( or currents ) to gradients in local ( coarse grained ) variables , can then be calculated from the appropriate correlation functions .",
    "some progress has been made in building a continuum description of granular fluids from a microscopic kinetic theory , but has typically involved a number of approximations that have yet to be tested .",
    "a hydrodynamic description is only possible if the spatial and temporal fluctuations in the flow are sufficiently localized to permit coarse graining",
    ". this may be the case if the granular system is large enough and the energy in the flow is high enough , but making this statement quantitative is very much an ongoing effort .",
    "precise experimental measurements of the steady state statistical properties in a variety of granular fluids are essential to developing and testing generally applicable descriptions .",
    "we have been investigating the fluidized state and the fluidization transition in a simple representation of a granular material : a single layer of identical spherical particles .",
    "using identical particles simplifies analysis of the system and allows for comparison with experimental and theoretical results derived for atomic and molecular dynamics .",
    "the use of a single granular layer , in combination with high speed imaging technology , allows for a thorough description of the granular system , including particle velocity distributions , correlation functions , and transport properties .",
    "we have found a complex phase diagram that bears many similarities to equilibrium two - dimensional systems , but we have also directly measured particle velocity distributions that are non - maxwellian , and density correlation functions that show non - equilibrium effects @xcite .",
    "we have also measured the cross - correlation between density and temperature fluctuations , and the effects of constraining the granular layer by placing a lid above it @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ setup ] describes the experimental setup and analysis techniques , and section [ phases ] describes the experimentally observed phase diagram .",
    "our results on the statistical characterization of the granular gas are reported in [ gas ] , followed by a comparison with related work and a discussion of future directions in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the experimental apparatus consists of a 20 cm diameter smooth , rigid aluminum plate that is mounted horizontally on an electromagnetic shaker that oscillates the plate vertically .",
    "the plate is carefully leveled , and the amplitude of acceleration is uniform across the plate to better that 0.5 % .",
    "the acceleration of the plate is monitored with a fast - response accelerometer mounted on the bottom surface of the plate .",
    "two types of particles were used for the experiments described below : smaller spheres of 302 stainless steel with an average diameter of 1.191 @xmath1 0.0024 mm , and larger spheres of 316 stainless with an average diameter of 1.588 @xmath1 0.0032 mm .",
    "the coefficient of restitution , both particle - particle and particle - plate , is about 0.9 .",
    "the particles are contained by an aluminum rim that occupies the outer 1.9 cm of the plate .",
    "the particles are illuminated by low angle diffuse light .",
    "this illumination produces a small bright spot at the top of each particle when viewed through a video camera mounted directly above the plate .",
    "two digital video cameras are used for data acquisition , a high - resolution camera for studying spatial correlations ( pulnix-1040 , 1024 x 1024 pixels , pulnix america , inc . ,",
    "sunnyvale , ca ) , and a high - speed camera for measuring velocity distributions ( dalsa cad1 , 128 x 128 pixels , 838 frames / second , dalsa inc . , waterloo , on ; canada ) .",
    "a collection of images and movies is available for viewing at www.physics.georgetown.edu/@xmath0granular .",
    "the acquired digital images are analyzed to determine particle locations by calculating intensity weighted centers of bright spots identified in the images .",
    "the frame rate of the high speed camera is much faster than the inter - particle collision rate , so it is possible to measure particle velocities by measuring the displacement of the particle from one image to the next .",
    "the trajectories determined from the images are nearly straight lines between collisions . although the frame rate is fast compared the collision time , the fact that it is finite introduces unavoidable systematic errors into the experimentally determined velocity distributions . some particles will undergo a collision between frames , and",
    "the resulting displacement will not represent the true velocity of the particle either before or after the collision . since fast particles are more likely to undergo a collision , the high energy tails of the distribution will be decreased .",
    "the probability that a particle of velocity @xmath2 will not undergo a collision during a time interval @xmath3 is proportional to exp@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean free path .",
    "the effect of this on the velocity distribution function reported here is quite small .",
    "in addition to taking velocities out of the tails of the distribution , collisions will incorrectly add the velocities of those particles elsewhere in the distribution .",
    "this effect can be minimized by filtering out the portion of particle trajectories where collisions occur .",
    "this is done by analyzing particle position in 3 images at a time .",
    "when the change in apparent velocity from the first two images differs from the change in the second two by more than a specified cutoff value , the points are neglected . because a relatively small fraction of the particles undergo a collision between any two frames , the results are not sensitive to the precise value chosen . at the highest accelerations considered in this work , varying the cutoff value over more than an order of magnitude changes the measured granular temperature ( _ rms _ velocity ) by less than 10% , and the flatness of the distribution ( eq . [ eq : flatness ] ) by less than 0.2 .",

    "it is not immediately clear what causes the frequency dependence in the phase diagram .",
    "for an ideal spherical particle on an oscillating plate with a velocity - independent coefficient of restitution , the dynamical behavior depends only on @xmath16 , and the frequency sets the timescale for the motion , and the length scale through @xmath17 , which is proportional to the distance a ball falls during one oscillation period .",
    "thus as the frequency is reduced for fixed @xmath16 , balls will bounce higher . because the balls in this system interact with their neighbors , it is possible that the frequency dependence enters through the ratio of this length scale to the ball diameter .",
    "in fact , the rapid increase in the acceleration where collapse forms for frequencies below about 50 hz ( see fig . [ phasediagram ] ) occurs when the particles begin to bounce high enough to hop over one another , resulting in a gradual transition from primarily 2d to 3d dynamics .",
    "this suggests that the frequency dependence comes from a characteristic frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sphere diameter .",

    "the appearance of strong clustering and associated nearly exponential velocity distributions at low accelerations may also be strongly influenced by ball - plate dynamics .",
    "the clusters are low energy regions of the system , and at low plate accelerations the rate of energy input may be a strong function of average particle energies , thereby enhancing the clustering tendency of inelastic particles .",
    "the details of this process are specific to our system , but all excited granular media require external forcing , and the rate of energy input is typically not independent of the dynamics of the grains themselves .      the granular layer at relatively high accelerations when constrained with a lid appears to be well suited for comparison with recent theoretical work on forced granular gases @xcite .",
    "the unusual behavior of the system at low accelerations appears to be intimately tied to the interaction of the balls with the plate , and the unconstrained system at high accelerations has a somewhat ill - defined density .",

    "furthermore , the experimental system of losert , et al.,@xcite was not constrained to be two - dimensional , but they do not obtain the crossover to gaussian measured in our system without the lid .    in the calculations of van noije , et al .",
    ", the inelastic particles are forced by uncorrelated white noise . in the experiment ,",
    "the energy is input into the horizontal velocities from the vertical velocity via collisions . given the complex dynamics of the system",
    ", the collisional forcing may be reasonably well described by uncorrelated accelerations , but the forcing occurs only during inter - particle collisions .",
    "for accelerations that occur much less frequently than the inter - particle collision times , the velocity distribution should approach the freely cooling result ( @xmath66 exp@xmath67 ) @xcite , whereas white noise forcing is well modeled by accelerations that occur on timescales much faster than the inter - particle collision time @xcite .",
    "however , a recent numerical simulation of white noise forcing @xcite found empirically that the behavior of the system was independent of the ratio between the rate of accelerations and the rate of collisions as long as the ratio was greater than one .",
    "this result suggests that the van noije , et al .",
    ", calculations are in fact valid for the granular monolayer , and the agreement between theory and experiment is not simply fortuitous .",
    "both our experiments and the results of losert , et al . , are consistent with velocity distributions that behave like @xmath40 exp@xmath41 in the tails , but we obtain that result only when the system is tightly constrained so that particles can not pass over one another , whereas the lid of the cell used by losert et al . , is 5 ball diameters above the plate .",
    "furthermore , losert et al . , include measurements up to @xmath68 , whereas the our results for an unconstrained layer show a velocity distribution that becomes almost completely gaussian when @xmath16 is increased to 3 .",
    "there are several differences between the systems ( stainless steel spheres on an aluminum plate vs. glass beads on delrin in losert , et al . )",
    ", that might effect the results , but the most significant difference may be that suggested by figure [ overlay ] , that the dynamics of the layer for a particular coverage are governed by @xmath16 and the ratio of the driving frequency to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sphere diameter . since even our largest particles are 2.5 times smaller than the glass beads used by losert , et al . , our measurements at @xmath12hz are in a different regime than their measurements at @xmath69hz .",
    "in particular , our system at @xmath39 may be more fully three dimensional than that of losert , et al . , and @xmath68 .",
    "consistent with this picture , losert , et al .",
    "do find that the exp@xmath41 scaling fails for lower frequencies .",
    "however , their measured velocity distribution does not appear closer to gaussian , as might be expected from our results .    in summary ,",
    "the vibrated granular monolayer has proved to be a rich testbed for the non - equilibrium dynamics of excited granular media .",
    "the ability to precisely measure statistical distribution functions under well controlled experimental conditions should allow for careful tests of the predictions of kinetic theory .",
    "a complete understanding of the dynamics will require a thorough study of the phase space , as well as a more careful consideration of the dynamics of energy transfers in the system .",
