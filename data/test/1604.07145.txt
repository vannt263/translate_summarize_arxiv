    "the diphoton excess with an invariant mass around @xmath0gev was recently reported by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations ; for a spin-@xmath5 particle with a narrow width approximation , the local significance is estimated to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . while more data is certainly needed to confirm if the signal is real or just a statistical fluke , its high statistical significance in the clean analysis using photons triggered enthusiasm and exuberance for the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , followed by the appearance of many theoretical papers .    among various models proposed so far ,",
    "the simplest one is to include a gauge singlet ( pseudo)scalar coupled to vector - like quarks and/or leptons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for the early works ) . in this model , the ( pseudo)scalar",
    "is produced via gluon fusion and decays into a pair of photons through one - loop diagrams with the extra quarks / leptons running in the loop .",
    "the diphoton excess can be explained if the product of the production cross section times branching ratio to two photons is in the range of @xmath8 fb .",
    "this gives a preference to a relatively large branching fraction to diphotons , which necessitates either multiple extra matter fields and/or large hypercharges @xmath9 of the extra field running in the loop .    in this paper",
    "we consider a possibility that the large hypercharges are originated from unbroken hidden u(1)@xmath10 gauge symmetry which has a relatively strong gauge coupling and a significant kinetic mixing with u(1)@xmath1 .",
    "then , hidden fermions acquire large hypercharges due to the kinetic mixing , and the induced hypercharges are generically irrational .",
    "we will show that the diphoton excess can be explained by the ( pseudo)scalar coupled to gluons and photons though the extra quark / hidden fermion loop diagrams .",
    "our scenario is based on a rather simple u(1)@xmath10 extension of the standard model , which enables us to make a definite prediction that can be tested soon at the lhc run-2 .",
    "since the hidden fermions are charged under u(1)@xmath10 , the ( pseudo)scalar responsible for the diphoton excess can also decay into @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the hidden photon .",
    "thus , our scenario predicts events with a photon and missing momentum , and we will see that its production cross section times branching fraction is simply related to that for the diphoton excess through the kinetic mixing . the events with a photon and missing momentum have been searched for at the lhc run-1  @xcite and run-2  @xcite , and there is an upper bound on the production cross section .",
    "we will see that the experimental bound places a _ lower _ bound on the kinetic mixing .",
    "a large kinetic mixing with u(1)@xmath10 is known to modify the normalization of the hypercharge so that the gauge coupling unification is improved  @xcite .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case in our model , taking account of contributions of the extra matter fields to the renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "the hidden fermions acquire hypercharges through the kinetic mixing , and they are cosmologically stable",
    ". such stable exotic charged particles , if produced abundantly in the early universe , could affect the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite as well as cosmic microwave back ground radiation ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "also there are various experimental searches for exotic fractional or multi charged particles  @xcite .",

    "[ n_l per baryon ]    one may wonder that negatively fractionally charged particles capture protons and/or heliums and form positive exotic ions , which can not annihilate with anti - particles due to the electrical repulsion of coulomb force  @xcite .",
    "however , in our model , the annihilation occurs due to the hidden u(1)@xmath10 gauge interaction , which is much stronger than the electric force , so that annihilation can not be prevented by the visible coulomb force .",
    "therefore the abundance of fractionally charged particles in the earth is given by eq .",
    "( [ n_l per baryon ] ) .",
    "fractionally charged particles can be observed by searching in bulk matter if they are trapped in rigid matter or water .",
    "most of the searches of fractionally charged particles put constraints on the abundance of particles with a fractional charge in the interval of @xmath257 $ ] where @xmath258 is any integer  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in the recent paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , they provided a constraint which is less stringent but is applicable to broader range of charges by using optically levitated microspheres in high vacuum .",
    "they also claimed that the previous works can constrain the abundance of particles with smaller charges by assuming the abundance of negative fractionally charged particles .",
    "this is because there can be multiple fractionally charged particles in each sample when their number density is sufficiently large . as a result ,",
    "the total charge in each sample is the summation of charges of those particles , which can be larger than about @xmath259 and can be detectable by those experiments .",
    "their results indicate that the abundance of fractionally charged particles has to be @xmath260-@xmath261 order of magnitude less than that of baryons , depending on their charge .",
    "for example , for a fractional charge in the interval of @xmath257 $ ] abundance per nucleon should be less than @xmath262 , and for a fractional charge in the interval of @xmath263 $ ] and @xmath264 $ ] abundance per nucleon should be less than @xmath265 .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ n_l per baryon ] ) is consistent with this upper bound .",
    "however , we should also consider the abundance of fractionally charged particles in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "its number density in the ism is much less than that in the earth , so that the annihilation is inefficient as discussed in ref .",
    "this may imply that the searches of fractionally charged particles in meteorites ( e.g. , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) exclude our model though the evolutionary history of meteoritic material is uncertain .",
    "in addition , the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ n_l per baryon ] ) does not take into account the flux of fractionally charged particles from the outer region of the earth .",
    "since they are abundant in the outer region , fractionally charged particles may fall into the earth just like cosmic rays .",
    "therefore the constraints coming from the search in bulk matter may exclude the scenario that fractionally charged particles survive at present . in the next subsection",
    ", we provide some mechanisms to evade those constraints .",
    "we can consider a scenario in which the unwanted charged particles are never produced after inflation , which requires that the maximal temperature of the universe after inflation is much lower than the mass of @xmath31 .. ] alternatively , one may consider huge late - time entropy production by thermal inflation . in this case , the hidden photon is also diluted , so that the dark radiation is absent [ see eq .",
    "( [ delta n_eff ] ) ] .",
    "another way to evade the constraints is to enhance their annihilation rate by a strong interaction .",
    "we may introduce an additional u(1)@xmath266 gauge symmetry under which the fields @xmath48 are charged  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a scalar monopole that develops an expectation value of order @xmath267 to break u(1)@xmath266 spontaneously .",
    "has both charges of @xmath197 and @xmath268 , an operator @xmath269 arises where @xmath270 is a scalar monopole .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to test a tev scale photon - photon collider depending on the sizes of the operator and @xmath17 .",
    "] as a result , the fields @xmath48 are connected by the physical string due to the dual meisner effect  @xcite , so that they soon annihilate with each other after the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "therefore the fields @xmath48 are absent after the ssb , so that we can evade the constraint coming from the searches of bulk matter as well as that coming from the observations of cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "gauge theory may be conformal in the presence of monopole as well as electrons .",
    "thus we need to take care of anomalous dimension of u(1)@xmath266 gauge field strength , which may result in the absence of interactions between u(1)@xmath266 and u(1)@xmath10  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we neglect this issue by assuming that the conformal coupling constant is not large and the anomalous dimension is sufficiently small .",
    "[ ft : yamada ] ] we assume that there is no additional mixing among u(1)@xmath1 and u(1)@xmath266 so that our calculations given in the previous sections are not changed . and u(1)@xmath266 can be removed by the shift of u(1)@xmath266 charge of @xmath48 . ] in this case , when @xmath31 and @xmath271 are produced via the drell - yan process at the collider experiment , they form a bound state decaying into @xmath93 , @xmath11 and @xmath97 .",
    "also , when the center of energy available is sufficiently large , mesonization occurs and four - photon signals will be observed due to the subsequent annihilation of the mesons @xmath272 .",
    "when the number of flavor of the hidden particle is larger than unity , we can predict a long - lived neutral particle that can be a candidate for dm .",
    "we consider @xmath48 with @xmath273 and assume that the flavour is not mixed so that the @xmath274 bound state ( which we denote @xmath275 ) does not annihilate after the ssb of u(1)@xmath266 .",
    "since this bound state is neutral and stable , it can be dm .",
    "when their masses are larger than @xmath276 , the relic abundance of the fields @xmath48 is determined by their annihilation rate [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_l ] ) ]",
    ". then they are attached by the physical string after the ssb .",
    "the other bound states ( e.g. , @xmath277 ) annihilate into visible photons . as a result",
    ", the relic density of @xmath31 is given by n_~. this is consistent with the observed dm abundance when the masses of @xmath48 are of order @xmath278 .",
    ", bound states form at the ssb and then their abundance is determined by the subsequent annihilation .",
    "the annihilation rate of @xmath275 is estimated as @xmath279 where @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) is the dynamical scale of the confinement .",
    "thus we can account for the observed dm density when the dynamical scale is around the unitarity bound of order @xmath282 . in this case , however , the cross section of the diphoton signal is suppressed and we can not explain the excess reported by atlas and cms . ] the dm can decay when we write a higher dimensional operator of @xmath283 .",
    "however , its lifetime is much larger than the present age of the universe for @xmath284 , so that we expect no astrophysical signal from dm decay .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0gev diphoton excess can be explained by introducing a pair of vector - like quarks and hidden fermions charged under a hidden u(1 ) gauge symmetry which has a significantly mixing with u(1)@xmath1 .",
    "the hidden u(1 ) has a relatively large coupling constant , which may naturally arise from string theory compactifications  @xcite . due to the large coupling and kinetic mixing ,",
    "hidden fermion loops induce a sizable branching fraction of a 750gev scalar to diphotons .",
    "notably , the standard model gauge couplings unify around @xmath2gev with effects of the kinetic mixing , suggesting the grand unified theory without too rapid proton decay . obviously ,",
    "instead of introducing the hidden fermions , one can consider vector - like quarks ( and leptons ) charged under both the sm gauge symmetry and the hidden u(1 ) gauge symmetry , which leads to similar results .",
    "our scenario can be checked by looking for events with a photon and missing transverse momentum .",
    "its cross section is related to that for the diphoton final state through the kinetic mixing , and predicted to be large .",
    "therefore , our scenario can be tested in the near future at the lhc experiment .",
    "so far we have focused on the case in which the phase component , @xmath59 , is responsible for the diphoton excess . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "our analysis can be similarly applied to the radial component , @xmath58 , in eq.(2.9 ) ; in general , @xmath58 with a mass of 750 gev decays mainly into a pair of @xmath59 , each of which decays into @xmath93 , @xmath11 , and @xmath97 , in addition to the loop - induced decays .",
    "the photons ( @xmath285 ) produced from the decay of @xmath59 are collimated if the axion is sufficiently boosted , and the two collimated photon pairs may be identified with the diphoton signal in the detector analysis .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the collimated photons in association with the diphoton excess . ) in our model , the ratio of the branching fraction into the combination of @xmath286 and @xmath12 depends on the kinetic mixing . as a result",
    ", we may have triphoton and tetraphoton signals , depending on the probability that the collimated photons are identified with a single photon at the detector .",
    "if those signals are confirmed by the upcoming lhc data , it would give a smoking gun signature of the diaxions decaying into photons and hidden photons .",
