    "transformations between different solid states of a material are essential for many technological and scientific applications , and understanding their kinetics is therefore not only interesting because of the scientific variety and beauty , but also important for tailoring of new materials with specific properties . often , these processes are accompanied by elastic deformations , which can be e.g.  due to density differences or structural changes , which provoke stresses at interfaces between adjacent phases .",
    "the influence on the thermodynamics of the transitions between different phases has been thoroughly discussed in the literature @xcite , whereas the kinetics of these processes are still far less understood .    facing this lack of understanding",
    ", we would like to mention that very fruitful concepts have been developed to describe the dynamics of solidification or melting processes as moving boundary problems .",
    "it means that the evolution of the different phases is described on the very detailed level of the motion of the interfaces between them , for which suitable equations of motion have to be posed .",
    "a particular application is the famous example of dendritic growth , where heat or component diffusion is the rate limiting process . at the interface between the solid and melt phase the temperature or concentration is close to its phase equilibrium value .",
    "the concentration jump or the release of latent heat due to partitioning leads to a jump in the corresponding fluxes at the interfaces , and the magnitude of this jump is directly related to the local interface velocity . altogether , this provides a closed description for the motion of each interface point , and many efforts have been done towards analytical and numerical solutions of this problem .",
    "it turns out that the questions concerning existence , shape and growth velocity of steady state patterns in solidification crucially depend on selection mechanisms . in this spirit",
    "the influence of many different physical effects on solidification or melting processes has been studied throughout the years @xcite .",
    "for example , the effect of isotropic surface tension was proven not to serve as a selection mechanism for a solution , whereas anisotropic surface tension leads to a unique solution .",
    "also , the appearance of triple junctions can provide a selection mechanism , and can therefore lead to a solution of the free boundary problem @xcite .",
    "of course , the situation considering solid - solid transformation kinetics differs significantly from the solidification or melting problem , where elastic effects often play only a minor role .",
    "still , we follow here the same successful concepts to formulate a free boundary description for the transformation kinetics in solids , now including the important effect of elasticity . in real systems",
    "many other effects apart from elastic effects come into play  like inhomogeneous compositions , the mullins - sekerka instability , crystal anisotropies , polycrystalline structures , etc .  and also",
    "quite successful attempts have been made to model this complex behavior ( see for example in @xcite and references therein ) . here , in contrast , we focus on gaining a fundamental understanding of the elastic influence on pattern formation processes , and we restrict our investigations therefore to simple and  clean \" model systems .",
    "correspondingly , we consider only a single diffusion field , namely the thermal diffusion in pure materials .",
    "the formulation of such a model system requires to write down explicit expressions for the boundary conditions and suitable equations of motion at the propagating interfaces , which therefore have to be tracked during the entire dynamical process . finally , it provides a detailed description of the microstructure evolution on the level of individual grains in a polycrystalline structure . as for the dendritic growth , we focus here on the regime of diffusion limited growth .",
    "then , propagation of a front generates or consumes latent heat , which has to diffuse through the system , and we assume that this is the rate - limiting process .",
    "this is in contrast to isothermal solid - solid transformations that were discussed in @xcite , which are driven by local interface kinetics , therefore allowing fast front propagation also on the scale of the sound speed .",
    "many important properties result from the influence of elastic effects due to structural transformations and density differences .",
    "apart from sharp interface methods , that are based on green s function techniques , we also use phase field descriptions , which are nowadays widely used .",
    "more importantly , however , is that we supplement these numerical investigations by analytical calculations which allow to understand these processes and the relevant parameters on a deeper basis .",
    "specifically , we consider the growth of an equilibrium solid phase @xmath0 from another metastable solid phase @xmath1 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . at a temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "both stress - free phases are in bulk equilibrium with each other , whereas below this value the new @xmath0 phase is thermodynamically favorable .",
    "far ahead of the propagating front , the system is therefore exposed to a lower temperature @xmath3 , and we define a dimensionless temperature @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the latent heat of the transition and @xmath6 the heat capacity . within the solid phases the evolution of the temperature field obeys a diffusion equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the thermal diffusivity , which we assume to be equal in both phases , as well as the heat capacity ( symmetrical model ) .",
    "the motion of the interfaces follows from energy conservation principles , which account here for the net heat flux and the generation or absorption of latent heat due to the local motion of the interface with normal velocity @xmath9 , @xmath10}-\\nabla w_{int}^{[\\alpha ] } ) , \\label{eq : heat - conservation - equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the interface normal and the superscripts denote the phases .",
    "elastic effects enter into the problem via a modification of the local phase equilibrium condition at the moving interfaces .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations @xcite , we now assume the phases to be coherently connected , i.e.  we neglect the appearance of any slips , detachments or defect formation at the interfaces , which is reasonable for small misfits .",
    "it is important to mention here , that with the assumption of coherency we formulate a completely different model being capable to describe qualitatively different types of elastic effects .",
    "for example the well - known effect of elastic hysteresis @xcite , which was proven to disappear without coherency @xcite , is now included in the model .    in a lagrangian description of linear elasticity , the displacement field",
    "is denoted by @xmath12 , and the coherency condition reads , @xmath13}=\\mathbf{u}^{[\\beta]}$ ] at the interface . the strain field",
    "is then given by the symmetrical spatial derivative , @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that tangential and shear strains @xmath15 are continuous at the interface with @xmath16 being the two tangential directions .",
    "force balance demands the continuity of the normal and shear stresses , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the normal direction . here , the stresses are defined as the derivative of the free energy with respect to the strains , @xmath19 .    , of a thermodynamically favored phase @xmath0 into a metastable phase @xmath1 , which is initially at temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the motion of the interface is locally described by the interface - normal velocity @xmath21 , which is given by the local heat conservation eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat - conservation - equation ] ) .",
    "the dashed lines at the two side borders indicate that we will discuss two different types of outer boundary conditions : free growth , where the strains decay for @xmath22 , and channel growth , with fixed displacements and thermal insulation at the walls . in the growth direction",
    "@xmath23 the system is assumed to be infinite in both cases . [",
    "fig : geometry],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the interface temperature for a planar , stress free interface is given by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "capillary corrections induce a curvature dependent term , and for simplicity we discuss only the case of isotropic surface tension @xmath26 .",
    "finally , elastic deformations lead to an additional change of the interface temperature . altogether , this leads to the local equilibrium boundary condition @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the capillary length and @xmath29 the local curvature of the interface , counted positive for a convex phase @xmath0 ( see fig .",

    "here , we use the sum convention for repeated indices for the sake of brevity .",
    "from now on , we restrict our considerations to linear isotropic elasticity . taking the relaxed state of the @xmath1 phase as reference , the elastic contribution to the free energy there reads @xmath33 } & = \\frac{e}{2(1+\\nu)}\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu}\\epsilon_{ii}^{2}+\\epsilon_{ik}^{2}\\right),\\label{eq : free - energy - reference}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are young s elastic modulus and poisson ratio , respectively .",

    ", the elastic degrees of freedom relax fast on diffusive timescales , and therefore the application of static elasticity is legitimate .",
    "therefore , newton s second law becomes @xmath41    the above set of equations now has to be supplemented by boundary conditions at the external system boundaries , and we will discuss different scenarios below .",
    "they complete the self - sonsistent description of the moving boundary problem , which require the simultaneous solution of the elastic and diffusion equations , coupled via the boundary conditions at the propagating interfaces , leading to a complicated nonlinear and nonlocal problem .",
    "we note that we will later also discuss more complicated situations with more than one growing phase .",
    "then , also similar boundary conditions and equations have to be set up for the interfaces between them .",
    "typically , then also triple junctions will appear , where the contact angles are given by young s law .",
    "the simplest case of a characteristic lattice strain is to assume the bond length of the new phase @xmath0 to be uniformly longer or shorter in all directions in comparison to the reference phase , i.e.  @xmath42 , which implies a density change .",
    "notice , that this kind of transformations , to which we will refer to as _ dilatational eigenstrain _ , only changes the volume of an elementary cell , and not its relative dimensions or its scaled shape",
    ".    the opposite case are transformations , where the volume of the unit cell is conserved and only the shape is changed .",
    "these _ shear transformations _ are characterized by a traceless eigenstrain tensor . a particular transition involving shear",
    "strain can occur e.g.  in hexagonal crystals , where the transition leads to a lowering of the symmetry from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "this is the case for example in hexagonal - orthorombic transitions in ferroelastics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "its obvious , that the orientation angle @xmath48 of the new orthorhombic phase can have only the three different values @xmath49.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    then the nonvanishing components of the eigenstrain tensor @xmath50 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where the orientation angle @xmath48 is either @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "we also consider a more generic mixed mode case , where the self - strain of the transformation is a linear combination of the above two different transformations .",
    "we will discuss the following two mixing cases @xmath55 and refer to them as positive or negative mixing .",
    "it is important to mention that switching from positive to negative mixing corresponds to a rotation of the eigenstrain tensor by an angle @xmath56 . since our model is isotropic in all respects except the choice of the eigenstrain tensor , the only predefined direction is given by the growth velocity",
    "therefore , we can interpret the negative mixing case to represent physically the same system as the positive mixing case but with a growth direction perpendicular to it .",
    "as a first application , we discuss the growth of the stable @xmath0 phase from the metastable @xmath1 phase in an infinitely large system , which is exposed to the temperature @xmath3 far away from the interface . for simplicity , we discuss an effectively two - dimensional infinite system , assuming translational invariance in @xmath46 direction . in particular , we assume a plane strain situation from point of view of elasticity . also , we choose the elastic boundary conditions such that all stresses decay far away from the interface .    seeking for steady state solutions in free space ,",

    "we can therefore use an integral representation of the displacement field , @xmath63 where the integration is performed along the interface , and the free - space green s tensor @xmath64 of the elastic problem is given by @xcite @xmath65 this function is the displacement response at @xmath66 to a point force located in the origin . as a result , the mismatch provokes long - ranged elastic deformations , and therefore induces a nonlocal character to the problem .",
