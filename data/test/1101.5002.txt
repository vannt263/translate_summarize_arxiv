    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) , particularly featured by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , has been always facing the fundamental critics since its establishment @xcite .",
    "the exact physical meaning of `` quantum '' is unclear , which leads to the well - known `` weirdness '' .",
    "the development of quantum field theory ( qft ) , which is often viewed as an improved form of qm , does not resolve the seminal problems in qm , such as the direct physical meaning of wave function and phase , the role of quantization and measurement , etc .",
    "the problem of the foundation of qm has been widely concerned again due to the progress of quantum information and quantum computing ( qiqc ) @xcite .",
    "the concepts of nonlocality and entanglement have proven their importance , yet , there exist confusions between them @xcite .    for the research of foundation of qm , we can briefly clarify two sub - fields , one is the interpretation of qm @xcite , the other is the post - qm @xcite .",
    "the problems and confusions on basic concepts even philosophy , such as the classical @xcite , hidden variable @xcite , collapse @xcite , etc are mostly addressed in the interpretations .",
    "post - qm also devotes to the complete mathematical form of qm , such as the information - theoretic approach @xcite , the khler structure approach @xcite , etc .",
    "the standard qm bases on several assumptions , and the physical explanations of the copenhagen ( orthodox ) interpretation are not satisfying .",
    "uncertainty and complementarity are emphasized ; however , for uncertainty , there are different explanations , either based on measurement , knowledge , propensity , or reality @xcite . for the statistical meaning of the wave function and measurement",
    ", the disagreement is more notable .",
    "born viewed statistics as inherent , while einstein , by epr - argument @xcite , viewed statistics as a result of incompleteness of qm . the notable `` jump '' and",
    "`` collapse '' do not have clear physical pictures .",
    "the most primary problem is that the copenhagen interpretation did not give an exact and direct meaning to the wave function , e.g. , why @xmath1 is complex ?",
    "indeed , there are direct efforts to explain the physical meaning of wave function , which led to the hidden variable method and bohm mechanics @xcite .",
    "every particle is endowed with definite coordinate and trajectory under the restraint of guiding wave .",
    "also , there exists the physical collapse theory aimed to explain collapse @xcite .",
    "however , it modifies the schrdinger equation and the linearity , which is shown to be the analogy of the approaches based on decoherence @xcite . coherence and decoherence , which were not demonstrated in the standard qm , have gained lots of attentions these years .",
    "for instance , the many - world interpretation @xcite views the universe as a coherent entity , and there exist the inner observer and relative state . the consistent ( decohered ) history approaches @xcite take the time evolution and measurement into account , and demonstrate the structure of quantum logic . in zurek s exsistential interpretation @xcite ,",
    "the uncertainty principle is re - explained from the view of information , and the born s rule is deduced via the symmetry of envariance .",
    "recently , kinds of information - theoretic theories @xcite are developed , where qm is viewed as a kind of information processing theory . with all these progresses , however , the exact essence of quantum has not been drawn .    at the same time ,",
    "the continuous argument on foundation of qm also arose the reflection of the primary philosophical conception , which can not be avoided in the quantum physics .",
    "the problem that why we can not easily understand qm just brings the problem that why we think the classical mechanics ( cm ) is normal . in this paper ,",
    "our standing point is to view qm as a special kind of `` description '' of motion , from which , there is no good or bad of qm and cm @xcite .",
    "the theories , with equations and models , deal with the same nature only revealing different aspects and properties .",
    "the state vector in hilbert space can capture the properties of coherence , e.g. , interference , which is exotic for cm . on the contrary",
    ", trajectory is the basic idea in cm and the macroscopic world , yet , not in qm , due to the uncertainty .",
    "we note the trajectory in the path - integral method , which borrows ideas from cm , only has mathematical meaning . in practice ( reality ) , to employ which description depends on its efficiency .    in this work , we start from one new concept , `` scope '' , to check the foundation of qm .",
    "we focus on the basic concepts and ideas in qm , mostly relating to superposition .",
    "we do not intend to construct a broader theory with the standard qm as the special case , the methods based on scope mainly belong to the interpretation of qm .",
    "scope describes the `` structure of motion '' , i.e. , the logic and systematic potential action region of the movement of a certain object ( system ) .",
    "that is , from scope we can get the ability and the whole structure of the motion of the matter .",
    "the merits of the concept of scope are multi - folds .",
    "firstly , the direct one , the weirdness of qm can be resolved based on scope , the wave function and superposition can get their physical meaning . secondly , the abstract qm can gain solid natural foundation and physical essence , i.e. ,",
    "qm is a totally new kind of description different with cm ( including statistical mechanics ) and also relativity .",
    "thirdly , scope can bring new ideas .",
    "for instance , the wave function and superposition principle can also be used in the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales , that is , the concept of scope is universal , can not be restricted by the scale .",
    "also , qm may not rely on the hilbert space , since scope itself can form a kind of space , also there can be other kinds of space , e.g. , tangnet @xcite , relating to quantum information and entanglement . forth , another point , the concept of scope may have new indication of the basic ideas of nature and philosophy , e.g. , it means every object has finite ability of motion .",
    "this work is divided into four parts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : open ] , we start from the concept of openness , which is central for qm , to clarify several basic physical ideas . in sec . [ sec : scope ] , we introduce the new concept of `` scope '' , from which we discuss the physical meaning of superposition and entanglement , and to address the foundation of qm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement ] , we study several kinds of quantum states , and we analyze the degree of entanglement and information .",
    "several topics are discussed in the appendix .",
    "one is the differences between scope and other existed methods , where we state that the concept of scope has never been proposed before .",
    "another one is the model for the reduced entanglement , by comparison with the two - body problem in cm .",
    "last , we study the physical meaning of entanglement measures at present , like negativity , relative entropy of entanglement . in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and discuss briefly the physical roles of scope in the foundation of qm .",
    "in this section , before the study on the concept of scope and entanglement , we show that the concept of openness is fundamental in qm .",
    "openness means that the quantum object can not be separated from the outside world , and the basic subject in qm is the open system , just the opposite of cm @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for openness is the existence of quantum coherence .",
    "we show that all the basic equations in qm demonstrate the openness and coherence .",
    "the quantum coherence leads to many crucial facts , such as the double - slit interference , coherent and squeezed state of light , also the heisenberg s uncertainty principle , etc .",
    "relating to measurement , the uncertainty principle states that any measurement disturbs the state of the quantum system , since the coherence is disturbed . on the contrary ,",
    "the nature light from sun is not coherent as it is a kind of mixture . in cm",
    ", there is no coherence , which is the main distinction between quantum and classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "usually , in qm the method of density matrix @xcite is employed to capture coherence , which is represented by the non - diagonal elements .",
    "a diagonal density matrix is said to be classical as the coherence vanishes .",
    "in qft , there exists coherence since the quantum field itself is the coherent entity , such as vacuum , electromagnetical field etc , although the density matrix is not often used .",
    "`` coherent '' means that the field as a whole has fixed amplitude and phase .",
    "the micro - particles , as the excited state of field , have coherence since interactions between them are due to the field .",
    "the facts of particle creation , classicality , and decoherence lead to the degeneracy of coherence , yet , particle can go back to its ground state via the annihilation operator , thus , re - excite the coherence @xcite .    in addition",
    ", we note that the standard qm does not focus on the properties of field , e.g. , the creation and vanish of particles , also the origin of ensemble , which we will discuss below .      in qm",
    ", there was the argument that whether quantum theory describes the dynamics of the single system or the ensemble @xcite .",
    "according to the standard qm , the existence of ensemble is _ a priori _ fact .",
    "for instance , in the double - slit interference experiment , the ensemble of electrons is used , the electrons are viewed as identical , and the state of electrons are the superposition of two modes corresponding to the two slits . here",
    ", qm can not explain the origin of the ensemble ; in contrast , qft can give the creation - annihilation picture of the ensemble of electrons .",
    "the quantum states of each electron before entering the slit are not necessarily orthogonal , and there exists field among the electrons , that is , the existence of ensemble does not mean there is no coherence .    yet",
    ", the methods of qm are believed as universal @xcite , thus , it should provide the physical picture for ensemble .",
    "recently , there are efforts to indicate the quantum origin of ensemble via entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the system within the coherent universe behaves as the canonical ensemble , as if the universe were in the mixed state , in which each pure state has the equal probability .",
    "physically , there can be kinds of coherence and decoherence processes in qm , which relates to the distinction between the fine - grained and coarse - grained description of states of the system @xcite .",
    "we will further analyze this in the study of density matrix below .",
    "in addition , we note that the concept of ensemble is similar to `` mixture '' , which is also widely employed in qm .",
    "however , the `` mixed state '' is not an exact expression , e.g. , it does not indicate the state is of one single object or many objects",
    ". we view mixture as the classical concept .",
    "the coherence indicates the openness of quantum dynamics .",
    "here we show that the basic equations of qm all demonstrate the openness . the schrdinger equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is viewed as the pure state vector of the system , from which the eigenstate and the eigen - energy can be deduced",
    ". the single quantum system can be , e.g. , one electron , field , or ensemble of electrons , as long as there exists coherence . here",
    ", `` single '' is different with that in cm , where the system is labeled by mass .",
    "the wave function has the property of holistic , and we can say that the system is `` open inside '' . now , for schrdinger equation",
    ", it is easy to get the following equations @xmath4 .",
    "let the density matrix ( or statistical matrix ) @xmath5 , and @xmath6,\\ ] ] which is the liouville equation .    in reality , it is often impossible to get the wave function , i.e. , to collect all the information of the system",
    "this can be described by the well - known @xmath7 model , where the universe @xmath8 contains one system @xmath9 embodied by one environment @xmath10 .",
    "the wave function distributes across @xmath9 and @xmath10 . according to the method of entanglement and schmidt decomposition @xcite : @xmath11 then the density matrix @xmath12 where coherence is the non - diagonal elements .",
    "the state of the system is deduced by tracing out the environment @xmath13 with @xmath14 , which is often viewed as the origin of the classical measurement results .",
    "further , interestingly , the wave function can also be written as @xmath15 where the set @xmath16 is also wave function , thus , not necessarily orthogonal , and the parameters @xmath17 are complex , with @xmath18 .",
    "the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfes ] ) is the `` wave function of ensemble state '' ( wfes ) , the detailed properties are discussed in appendix [ sec : wfesd ] .",
    "this decomposition is coarse - grained , i.e. , each @xmath19 can further be decomposed as the superposition of orthogonal states . in the ensemble , each party has the property of openness that there can be ( but not necessarily ) coherence between any two of them .",
    "last , another well - known form is the wigner function @xcite in the quantum phase - space , which is often written as @xmath20 where the integral is across the whole space",
    ". there exists a whole class of distribution functional , with the wigner function as the simplest and straightforward one @xcite . here , in the phase - space ,",
    "the system is represented by the coordinate and its movement is momentum @xmath21 .",
    "contrast with classical method , in wigner function , there exists another coordinate @xmath22 , which is integrated out .",
    "the physical meaning is that the effects of the outside world ( environment ) should be deleted ( tracing out ) , so that we can confirm the existence of the system . from this point",
    ", we can say that the phase - space approach in qm is also natural since it captures the essence of openness , the negative value of @xmath23 is one expression .    to sum up ,",
    "in this section we show that the existence of coherence is central for quantum behaviour , which results in the openness demonstrated by all the basic equations of qm .",
    "we note that here we do not study the detailed properties and classifications of quantum coherence . in the next section",
    ", we will further show that quantum coherence and the property of openness can be based on the new concept of `` scope '' , and from which , we will analyze the direct physical meaning of the wave function and also entanglement .",
    "in this section , we study the foundation of qm from the concept of `` scope '' .",
    "briefly , scope , or quantum scope , describes the `` structure of motion '' , which means the action region of the motion , and the correlations among states and observable , rather than the casual dynamics , neither the structure of matter , nor matter . by comparison , according to cm , the object , labeled by mass @xmath24 , associates with a certain force , satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "here , in qm every motion has a certain scope .",
    "the wave function is indeed the scope of the quantum dynamics .",
    "further , the concept of scope is not restricted within qm , it is the universal method , and it has the connections with other methods , such as relativity .",
    "below , we present the theorems and properties of scope . before that",
    ", we first note two points .",
    "firstly , the concept of scope is in consistent with qm , since it is directly based on qm .",
    "secondly , scope can give physical meaning to wave function and also superposition , then complete the basic principle of qm .",
    "firstly , we present the theorems relating to scope itself , we state that the principles of superposition and entanglement are universal .",
    "every motion has one scope @xmath26 .",
    "here `` motion '' includes the condition when the observed velocity of one object is zero . strictly , there is no object at rest .",
    "scope @xmath26 belongs to the motion of a certain object , not the object itself .",
    "the concept of scope describes the ability of motion in a systematical way .",
    "scope @xmath26 is composed with state @xmath27 and its weight @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 decides the space of @xmath32 , labeled as @xmath33 .",
    "the concept of `` state '' originates from qm and statistical physics .",
    "@xmath27 can be a vector in the hilbert space , or the point in the tangnet space @xcite .",
    "within one scope @xmath26 , there can be many physical states @xmath27 .",
    "one motion can only be in state within its own scope .",
    "the principle of superposition has two parts :    * _ the principle of superposition of scope @xmath26 _ : + the scope of motion can be expressed as the superposition of all the states within as @xmath34 there is a set of povm `` active operator '' @xmath35 which associates with @xmath26 and satisfies + @xmath36 + which means @xmath37 can act state @xmath38 out from scope @xmath26 . here , we employ dirac s `` bra - ket '' symbol @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 satisfies    @xmath39    which means @xmath40 is the eigenvalue of the `` activer '' @xmath37 .",
    "this is the alternative of the `` probabilistic interpretation '' of the coefficients @xmath40 in qm .",
    "also @xmath41 which means all the states are acted out , that is , the whole scope @xmath26 is realized @xmath42 , thus @xmath43 .",
    "this is the origin of the `` normalization regulation '' . from the probabilistic view , it means the sum of all the probabilities equals to 1 .    and , @xmath44 also , there exists the `` anti - active operator '' 1-@xmath45 .",
    "we do not study the active operator in detail here .",
    "* _ the principle of superposition of state @xmath1 _ : + the state of motion can be the coherent superposition state as @xmath46 where normalization means the norm of a state vector is @xmath47 , which is the result , yet not the same with the property of scope .",
    "note that the superposition for mixed , pure , also classical states are all included .",
    "there exists entanglement between two or multi- scopes .    the entangle process @xmath48 for two systems @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be written as    @xmath51    we note that the analysis can be generalized to multi - systems directly , here we focus on bi - party system for clarity .",
    "@xmath52 represents the entangle process .",
    "there are two parts of the principle of entanglement :    * _ the principle of entanglement of scope @xmath26 _ : + the entangled scope of motion can be @xmath53 where the sets of relative states @xcite @xmath54 and @xmath55 correlate with each other one - to - one , which can be labeled as the `` 1 - 1 branch '' rule . the details which @xmath38 is the relative state to @xmath56 is determined by nature , e.g. , the interaction .",
    "+ there also exist the set of active operator @xmath57 , which satisfies @xmath58 where the branch latexmath:[$|\\psi_i\\rangle",

    "( [ eq : separable ] ) ; this means the separable state is also the result of the entangle process of scope thus containing quantum information as we will show below ; ( 3 ) if @xmath63 , the state reduces to a simple product state .    in reality , the branches within the entangled scope are not all necessarily realized , thus , the entangled state is the fragment of the scope as long as satisfying the normalization rule .",
    "in addition , there may be interactions during the entangle process , however , entanglement describes the information transition or coherent correlations between different systems , instead of the energy transition .",
    "we will define the degree of entanglement @xmath64 in sec .",
    "[ sec : degree ] .",
    "next , relating to qm , particularly the dynamics of the scope and state , there are two theorems .",
    "there exist representations , corresponding to different complete sets formed by the commutative observable , labeled as `` the scope under representation '' .    in qm ,",
    "the physical reason for representation is that there exist different complete sets , which is demonstrated by bohr s complementarity principle @xcite .",
    "we note that , according to the consistent history approach @xcite , there exist several frameworks , which also satisfy the complementarity principle .",
    "this theorem indicates again that the concept of scope is the systematical , instead of casual , description of the potentiality and structure of the motion .",
    "there exist pictures , corresponding to different frames and time choice .",
    "there are three basic kinds of pictures as follows :    * _ the frame is set on the motion itself _ : schrdinger picture .",
    "+ the scope @xmath65 ( can also be labeled as @xmath9 ) satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hamiltonian .",

    "the existence of pictures and the problem of the external parameter @xmath68 reveal that scope mostly describes the logic structure of the states , from which the commutation relations of observable do not change with time .",
    "last , we show another kind of property of scope .",
    "there exist relations between the concept of scope and relativity , which describes the coherent properties of the space - time metric of the object . here",
    ", we only present the mostly crucial conjecture as below .",
    "the scope @xmath26 can be influenced by mass @xmath76 .",
    "this theorem sets the connection between the motion of a certain object and the object itself .",
    "it means that objects with different masses can not have the same scope .",
    "every scope is unique . also , the shape of scope is not regularly euclidian .",
    "in general , it is topologically non - euclidian .",
    "please see the geometrical properties @xmath77 of scope below .      in this subsection , we study some properties and consequences deduced from the theorems above of scope .",
    "scope @xmath26 has a certain geometrical shape .",
    "the number of state @xmath31 can not be zero .",
    "the states within the scope can form certain shape .",
    "for instance , if there is one single state , @xmath31=1 , the corresponding shape of scope is just a point ( in geometry ) . if @xmath31=2 , the shape is one segment line , straight or carved , with a certain length . if @xmath31=3 , the shape is one triangle face , with a certain area . if @xmath31=4 , the shape is one tetrahedron . if @xmath78 , the shape is one ball .",
    "we should state that the shape is in the three - dimensional space , euclidian or non - euclidian , different from the shape in the high - dimensional space , such as the hilbert space .",
    "the shape not only has the `` shell '' with boundary and face , also it has inner structure .",
    "particularly , when @xmath78 , if we neglect its structure , the ball can be viewed as one point .",
    "this is the alternative of the `` classical limit '' of the orthodox qm by taking @xmath79 .",
    "we note that the geometric properties of quantum states are under research , see ref .",
    "@xcite for instance .",
    "scope @xmath26 has a certain magnitude .",
    "the magnitude is defined as the length ( or the area , the volume ) of its shape . to calculate",
    ", we have to specialize the `` distance '' between different states .",
    "for instance , we can use the energy @xmath10 to define the distance @xmath80 , such as @xmath81    the magnitudes of @xmath26 of different movements should be different , since they have physical meanings .",
    "the bigger the magnitude , the better the ability of the motion , thus , the more `` freedom '' in the scope @xmath26 .",
    "the magnitude is not necessarily equal to one , which is different with the normalization condition .",
    "one particular scope @xmath26 has its own space - time matric .",
    "this is the direct result of theorem @xmath82 . when the effect of mass is not obvious",
    ", we can set the space - time matric of different scopes the same with each other , which is another kind of classical limit , or the low - energy limit .",
    "the scope @xmath26 has the properties of `` reality '' ( actuality ) and `` propensity '' .",
    "when @xmath37 acts , the certain state @xmath38 is realized , from potential to real , and the scope @xmath26 `` gradually evolves to its whole form '' .",
    "there is the transition between reality and propensity .",
    "actually , the two aspects of scope were studied a long time ago by aristotle in the ancient greece @xcite .",
    "the method was mostly ignored and was claimed as `` metaphysical '' useless for physics . yet , the idea of propensity has gained quite a lot of attentions in recent years @xcite .",
    "the concept of @xmath26 manifests that qm is the systematical description of the structure of movement , which is totally new compared with the classical dynamical method , from which the `` local realism '' @xcite originates . thus , we view the critics based on local realism as the misunderstanding of the essence of qm . here",
    ", we do not discuss the problems of local realism and nonlocality in detail .    also , there is no `` collapse '' @xcite .",
    "collapse means that when there is measurement , the state collapses from superposed state to the eigenstate . or",
    ", some others view the collapse happens in our knowledge @xcite .",
    "in fact , with the process of decoherence @xcite , when the initial state is superposed , it decoheres instead of collapse when there is measurement or environment .",
    "measurement is a process of entanglement .",
    "this is a simple result of the fact that the apparatus also has one scope with the states relative to the observed system .",
    "the measurement process is the disturbance of system to apparatus ( or environment ) @xcite .",
    "the measurement problem in qm @xcite , as well as the observe effect in relativity , can be well explained with the method of entanglement , and the change of our knowledge is another story @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two kinds of states : time - quasistatic ( tq ) state and ensemble - isotactic ( ei ) state .    at present",
    ", there is no unified classification of quantum states .",
    "briefly , there are many kinds due to different criterions , such as separable / entangled , pure / mixed , local / non - local states , etc .",
    "the non - unification just indicates that the underlying physical reason for the classification is not clear .    we give a new classification as follows :    * onefold state * * eigenstate * * superposed state * * * time - quasistatic ( tq ) superposed state * * * ensemble - isotactic ( ei ) superposed state * multifold state * * factorizable state : product , separable , etc * * entangled state * * * time - quasistatic ( tq ) entangled state * * * ensemble - isotactic ( ei ) entangled state",
    "firstly , state is differentiated according to whether it is a multifold ( many - body ) state . for a single object ,",
    "its state is onefold state .",
    "there can be superposed state according to the principle of superposition . for multifold system which contains several inner parts ,",
    "the state is multifold state , and there can be entangled state .",
    "the separable state can be viewed as a kind of factorizable state , which we will study in the next section .",
    "the distinction of time - quasistatic ( tq ) state and ensemble - isotactic ( ei ) state bases on the theorem of ergodicity of statistical physics and the principle of identity in qm @xcite .",
    "for example , the double - slit state of the electron ( or other particles ) is the ei superposed state , which characterizes the electron ensemble . in this state , for one particular electron , it can only pass through one slit at one time , thus , the state of a single electron is not superposed .",
    "another example , as we know , we can use laser to control a certain two - level atom , and drive it to the so - called rabi oscillation @xcite .",
    "this is the tq state , the population transfers from one state to another periodically .",
    "the famous bell basis are the ei entangled state , such as the light source from type - ii spdc @xcite in the teleportation experiment , describing the ensemble of photons , the state of one photon is not entangled or superposed .",
    "an excellent example of tq entangled state is the electrons forming the chemical bonding in the molecules .",
    "the difference between ( ei ) state and ( tq ) state is the `` inner '' dynamics of the state itself , thus , this kind of definition is obviously not mathematical .",
    "however , in our study below , we do not care about this difference without loss of generality .",
    ", thus , qu@xmath83it ) .",
    "the correlation between scopes or states is depicted as straight line ( string ) . ]",
    "qm often deals with the properties of many - body ( instead of single or infinite ) system . to characterize the quantum features , at present ,",
    "there exist three widely studied methods : nonlocality @xcite , nonclassicality @xcite , and entanglement @xcite .",
    "traditionally , nonclassicality was introduced in the quantum phase - space in the context of quantum optics .",
    "the state of light , e.g. , squeezed light , contains nonclassicality compared with the coherent light , which sets the boarder between quantum and classical states .",
    "we note that the continuous variable ( cv ) system in phase - space can be translated into the fock space , from which the entanglement can be defined .",

    "we do not analyze them here .",
    "next , we turn to the quantization of the four kinds of correlations we defined in the last subsection .    for the entangled qudit ,",
    "the entanglement is the shared coherence , so the degree of entanglement @xmath166 can be easily calculated , according to the definition [ def:2 ] above .",
    "also , as we have discussed , we can employ different forms of entropy to characterize the quantum information .",

    "we will study some of them in appendix [ sec : measure ] .    for the decohered qudit ,",
    "there is pure classical correlation without shared quantum coherence .",
    "also , there exist the complete projective measurements , under which the classical density matrix remains @xcite .",
    "the information is characterized by the von neumann entropy .    for the four kinds of ensemble state ,",

    "the degree of nonorthogonality can be defined as @xmath229 in the sum , each element is smaller than one , yet , the sum can be arbitrarily big even infinity .",
    "this is reasonable since the quantity of coherence increases with the amount of the ensemble .",
    "particularly , we note that the separable state contains the quantum nonorthogonality thus quantum information , although there is no entanglement .    the coarse - grained classicality results from the classical parameter @xmath140 ,",
    "so the classical information can be easily calculated via the von neumann entropy @xmath230 .",
    "last , we make some comments on the mixed state , which , in deed , is a rather broad and rough method",
    ". the mixed state with purity smaller than unity is a `` fragment '' of a global pure state with an unknown part lost , thus , it is not easy to decide the exact structure of the mixed state . at present , there exist lots of ways to detect the entanglement , and different methods can be unified with the method of entanglement witness in a way @xcite . yet , even we can find the entanglement , we can not decide the structure of the mixed state .",
    "that is to say , to find how the mixed state is formed is more valuable and practical .",
    "the six kinds of states studied above can serve as some standard or assistant to detect the quantum correlations . when a mixed state @xmath231 can be written as similar to any standard state , labeled as @xmath232 , that is , if @xmath233 , then the quantum correlation ( entanglement , nonorthogonality , etc ) of @xmath231 can be defined as that of @xmath232 times @xmath234 .",

    ", we quantify the degree of superposition and entanglement , and also nonorthogonality .",
    "physically , entanglement is directly based on superposition , and nonorthogonality is also the result of superposition .",
    "the four kinds of correlations can be easily calculated .",
    "the weirdness of qm is a result of the nature of quantum coherence , the abstractness of quantum description , and the confusions on quantum logic and philosophy .",
    "the concept of scope , which is exotic for cm , relativity , statistical mechanics , also classical wave mechanics , just represents the quantum origin .",
    "it describes the possible ( potential ) action region and the systematic and coherent structure of movement of a certain object .",
    "superposition and entanglement are the natural results of scope with definite physical meaning . also , we discussed the properties of four kinds of quantum correlations and the six kinds of quantum states , and we show that entanglement is related yet different with entropy .",
    "further , the concept of scope brings new methods to the standard qm .",
    "one is that the scope itself has certain geometric features , just similar to the matter itself .",
    "this may indicate that the structure of the motion of the matter is more crucial than the structure of the matter itself .",
    "the other is that , rather than the information - theoretic framework , there exists a new kind of space , i.e. , tangnet , on which the quantum structure with entanglement exists @xcite . as a result , the concept of scope lays the new starting point to the foundation of qm . in the future ,",
    "further efforts on , e.g. , the geometrical properties of tangnet , the comparison of scope with other interpretations , also the relation between nonlocality and entanglement , are needed .",
    "in addition , the physical roles of entanglement in qiqc are also widely concerned , we hope our approach can bring new ideas on some tough problems , such as the bound entanglement @xcite , the analogy of entanglement to energy or entropy , etc .",
    "in hilbert space , one state vector can be decomposed via orthogonal basis also non - orthogonal basis .",
    "physically , the two decompositions can be endowed with different physical contents : for single system , there only exists orthogonal physical basis ; while for ensemble , there can be non - orthogonal basis . for example , the spin state in one quantum dot can be up or down , or to the left or right in the diagonal basis ; for a collection of spins in quantum dots , the superposed states of spins form the non - orthogonal basis .",
    "mathematically , based on the measurement theory , especially the positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite , we can see the wfes has the corresponding properties as the wave function of pure state .    for the pure state @xmath236",
    ", it satisfies : ( 1 ) normalization : @xmath237 ; ( 2 ) completeness relation : @xmath238 ; ( 3 ) projective measurement : there exist a set of projective operators @xmath239 satisfying @xmath240 , the expectation value @xmath241 ; note that when the non - projective povm operator acts on the pure state , it can not distinguish its basis ; ( 4 ) probabilistic interpretation : @xmath242 means the probability to find state @xmath243 with projector @xmath244 ; ( 5 ) observable : the expectation value of observable @xmath245 is @xmath246 , with @xmath247 ; ( 6 ) evolution : @xmath248 also the basis @xmath243 satisfy schrdinger equation ; ( 7 ) decoherence : the non - diagonal elements in @xmath249 disappear , leading to state @xmath250 , each part @xmath251 forms the classical trajectory ; ( 8) quantum reference frame @xcite : to determine the preferred basis @xmath252 , the reference frame and certain interaction are needed to form the entangled state , i.e. , the coherence within @xmath248 delocalizes to form entanglement ; thus , by ignoring the reference frame , the state @xmath248 decohered .    for the wfes , the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfes ] ) , the properties are similar while more complicated . we firstly note that if @xmath253 , it reduces to the pure state case ; if the states @xmath16 are orthogonal with each other , it goes to the totally classical ( decohered ) state .",
    "instinctively , there exists one pure density matrix , labeled as @xmath254 , which is @xmath255 to form the density matrix @xmath231 , the non - diagonal elements disappear , with coefficients @xmath256 , which is actually a kind of decoherence .",
    "the state @xmath257 indicates that before the formation of the ensemble , there exists one decoherence process .",
    "physically , the state @xmath3 stands for the `` field '' of the ensemble , and the ensemble emerges from the field after the decoherence process , i.e. , the creation of particles @xcite .",
    "note that here we do not study this issue with quantum field theory .",
    "we name this kind of coherence as _ sub - coherence _ , or coarse - grained coherence , and the decoherence as _ sub - decoherence_. to arrive at the classical state , the standard decoherence",
    "is then needed .",
    "if we only account coherence by ignoring sub - coherence , we can view @xmath3 as the wfes , from which , the density matrix @xmath231 for the ensemble emerges .",
    "further , the sub - decoherence can be introduced by one quantum reference frame @xmath258 , which with @xmath257 forms @xmath259 which is exactly the separable state @xcite .",
    "note that for pure state , the system and its reference frame form the entangled state .",
    "correspondingly , the basic properties of wfes are : ( 1 ) normalization : @xmath260 ; ( 2 ) completeness relation : @xmath261 ; ( 3 ) measurement : there exist a set of povm operators @xmath262 satisfying @xmath263 , the expectation value @xmath264 ; note that the measurement does not act on the fine - grained orthogonal basis directly ; ( 4 ) probabilistic interpretation : @xmath265 means the probability to find state @xmath266 with operator @xmath267 ; ( 5 ) observable : the expectation value of observable @xmath245 is @xmath268 , with @xmath269 ; ( 6 ) evolution : states @xmath3 and @xmath266 both satisfy schrdinger equation , with which the liouville equation for @xmath231 is equivalent ; ( 7 ) sub - decoherence : the non - diagonal elements in @xmath270 disappear , leading to quantum ensemble @xmath231 ; decoherence : the party @xmath266 each can further decohere , leading to classical state and classical trajectory , respectively ; ( 8) quantum reference frame : to determine the preferred basis @xmath271 , the reference frame @xmath232 and certain interaction are needed to form the separable state , i.e. , the sub - coherence within @xmath3 delocalizes to form separability ; thus , by ignoring the reference frame , the state sub - decoheres ; further , if there exists the entanglement - type reference frame , the state eventually decoheres to classical trajectory .",
    "last , to illustrate the difference between coherence and sub - coherence , we give one simple example : suppose there are only two parties , @xmath272 and @xmath273 , in the ensemble , and each party with only two orthogonal basis @xmath274 and @xmath275 , and @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "note that even if party @xmath273 is not in the basis @xmath278 , there can be rotation which can rotate it to this basis , with effects absorbed in the coefficients .",
    "thus , the density matrix of wfes is written as    @xmath279 and its conjugate , when they disappear , the state @xmath257 sub - decoheres to the quantum ensemble @xmath231 .",
    "the coherence is represented as the coefficients @xmath280 , @xmath280 and their conjugate , when they disappear , the state decoheres to the classical state , labeled as @xmath281 , with diagonal elements @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "_ scope and qft . _ in qft , the wave function is further viewed as the operator , which is the well - known `` second quantization '' . the total number of particles is not conserved as there always exist the fluctuations of field and creation / annihilatin of particles .",
    "particle itself is viewed as the excited state of field , and field is viewed as a kind of matter , whose motion exists within itself .",
    "thus , the second quantization of wave function , i.e. , scope , means to view the structure of the motion as the equivalence of the structure of matter , also to view the motion of the matter as the same with the matter itself , which is reasonable for field .",
    "this is also consistent with the mass - energy relation @xmath285 from relativity .",
    "however , for particles , atoms etc in qm , the object itself is different with its motion , thus , it is not proper to view scope as a kind of matter ; instead , scope should be viewed as a kind of description of the logical structure of the motion of the object .    in history , another physical picture similar with qft is mainly developed by de broglie , namely , the `` pilot wave '' approach @xcite , in which the particle with definite local form sits at a certain place in the real pilot wave , and the particle can be viewed as the high - energy concentrate singularity of the wave .",
    "the pilot - wave describes the collective motion of two objects : particle and wave , which indeed goes to the method of qft .",

    "also , the concept of `` matter wave '' was developed .",

    "the actuality ( reality ) and potentiality were systematically studied recently , where the authors stated that potentiality could be a mode of existence , and the concept of `` faculty '' was introduced to replace `` entity '' @xcite .",
    "the faculty describes a level which does not pertain to things but rather to potential actions .",
    "possessing a faculty offers the ability to do something . according to our understanding , yet , the concept of faculty is the analogy of potentiality .",

    "yet , we can apply the rough bi - party partition to deduce the apparent reduced mass or entanglement .",
    "however , we have to say , there are significant differences .",
    "for instance , the quantum probabilities @xmath346 and @xmath347 each exist in the probability space , and also they together exist in another probability space .",
    "but , the classical speed ( square ) @xmath348 and @xmath349 do not exist in the probability space with each other .",
    "this relates to the problem of special relativity , this simple mode may have implication for the relation between qm and relativity .",
    "according to our study , entanglement and quantum information ( entropy ) are different .",
    "entanglement is the shared coherence by the parties of the entangled state . also , we find nonorthogonality is the shared coherence within the local states of each party of the whole state .",
    "quantum information ( @xmath350 ) is the improved form of classical information ( correlation ) ( @xmath351 ) due to nonorthogonality ( @xmath352 ) or entanglement ( @xmath166 ) .",

    "the negativity is the same with concurrence , that is to say , the definition of negativity is more general than concurrence for bi - party pure state .",

    "the role of noise is to disturb and destroy the coherence .",
    "physically , the robustness can describe the shared coherence , thus give the right quantity of entanglement .",

    "it is well - known that the two are often different for mixed state , though the same for the pure state case .",
    "the physical reason is quite clear : they are the results of two different entanglement witness ( operator ) @xcite .",
    "physically , in the mixed state there can be nonorthogonality , which can influence concurrence and negativity without being detected . that is to say , it is not proper to generalize concurrence and negativity to the mixed state , since the result is not necessarily entanglement .        where the set @xmath383 can be taken as the set of separable states , states with positive partial transpose , nondistillable states , etc .",
