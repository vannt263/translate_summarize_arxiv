    "additional tunnelings between wires x and c , and x and d within a unit cell , as well as between wires y and a , and y and b in neighboring unit cells , which compete with the dominant intra building block tunnelings , can then be neglected , and the low - energy physics of the array is fully described by the integer or fractional quantum hall edge modes in wires a , b , c , and d , as well as the interactions and tunnelings between them .",

    "besides a blueprint for the constructivist engineering of 3d topological states , the coupled - wire construction provides particularly simple visualizations of the bulk gapped phases based on their hierarchy of couplings .",
    "the subleading couplings , which compete with the respective dominant coupling , are irrelevant , and the system is adiabatically connected to an array in which only the leading coupling is present . along the dominant tunnelings , the edge modes of the individual building blocks form closed loops and open planes of quantum hall layers , see fig .

    "all building blocks connect along closed loops , resulting in a full gap .",
    "the qah phase , on the other hand , consists of open quantum hall planes alternating with closed quantum hall loops .",

    "as one important step in this diagonalization , i highlight the fourier transformation along @xmath15 and @xmath19 , which yields @xmath143 with @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the number of unit cells in @xmath15 ( @xmath19 ) direction .    within the region of the phase diagram hosting the weyl semimetal in the non - interacting case @xmath88 , also the interacting array",
    "has excitations @xmath146 associated with momentum @xmath147 and @xmath148 that do not appear in the hamiltonian @xmath149 , but only in @xmath114 ( which accounts for the possibly interaction - renormalized kinetic energy along the @xmath115 direction ) . for @xmath88 , these are precisely the gapless electronic quasiparticles at the weyl nodes . outside the parameter regime hosting the weyl semimetal in the non - interacting case , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath150 does not vanishes for any @xmath151 . as a consequence ,",
    "all excitations create kinks of non - trivial energy in the sine - gordon hamiltonian @xmath149 , and are thus gapped .",
    "this suggests that the topology of the phase diagram is the same in the interacting and non - interacting cases .    as discussed in the last subsection",
    ", the fermionic character of the operators @xmath152 for @xmath88 can most easily be derived by refermionizing its components @xmath153 . for @xmath66 , however , the fields @xmath105 do not obey the same commutator as the non - interacting fields @xmath154 .",
    "this implies that the refermionization procedure does not carry over to the interacting case , and that the simple operators @xmath155 do , for general @xmath10 , not satisfy the canonical fermionic commutation relations .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that the operators    @xmath156    correspond to products of @xmath157 fermionic operators , rather than a single canonical fermion .",
    "the operators @xmath146 with @xmath66 thus do not correspond to individual 3d quasiparticle excitations of the array of wires .",
    "further extensions of the coupled wire construction are needed to determine if also the 3d quasiparticles at finite @xmath10 have linearly dispersing band touchings similar to weyl nodes .",
    "similarly , the properties of the interacting analog of the weyl semimetal phase , such as its response to electro - magnetic fields , can not be resolved by the present analysis based on a language of competing sine - gordon terms .    despite the fact that the present bosonized calculation does not allow to access the true quasiparticles in the generalized weyl semimetal regime for finite @xmath10 , i judge the striking analogy between the interacting and non - interacting cases , and ( for all @xmath10 ) the existence of operators that do not appear in @xmath149 in the regime hosting the weyl semimetal for @xmath88 , and only in this regime , to strongly support the existence of an extended critical phase separating the bulk gapped fractional phases emerging from the critical points discussed in sec .  [",

    "while one option for a possible critical phase would be a standard weyl semimetal , i note that transitions between the bulk gapped phases correspond to a rearrangement of only the edge states of the individual fractional quantum hall building blocks .",
    "their bulk gaps in the x and y wires , however , never close .",
    "i thus speculate that the quantum phase transitions of the interacting array , and the possible gapless critical phase inherit some of the exotic properties of fractional quantum hall edge modes .",
    "a critical phase could for instance be composed of fractionally charged fermionic 3d quasiparticles ( somewhat related ideas are discussed in refs .  ) .",

    "in this work , the coupled - wire approach has been adapted for the analysis of interacting topological phases in 3d .",
    "more precisely , i analyzed the 3d system resulting from connecting narrow 2d integer and fractional quantum hall building blocks along different directions .",

    "the surface on which this latter phase appears can be controlled by the ratio of two tunnel couplings .",
    "the coupled - wire language offers simple real space visualizations of the bulk gapped phases in terms of closed loops and open planes of 2d quantum hall subsystems . with electron - electron interactions",

    "some of these phases have topologically protected fractional edge states . in analogy to the non - interacting weyl semimetal ,",
    "the bulk gapped phases are separated by a regime in which certain excitation operators do not appear in the sine - gordon part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this supports the existence of an exotic critical phase similar to a weyl phase .",
    "the phase transitions of the array are of exotic nature , and correspond to a rearrangement of fractional quantum hall edge modes .",
    "if only a single sine - gordon term is present , the exotic nature of the phases and phase transitions could be revealed by an exact mapping , which identified the quasiparticles at special luther - emery points as fermions of fractional charge @xmath85 .",
    "the properties of the critical regime outside these special points will be addressed in future work .",
    "other interesting directions include the use of chiral spin liquids , topological superconductors , and states with a more complex edge structure ( such as moore - read states ) as 2d building blocks , as well as the coupled - wire analysis of non - abelian 3d phases with string - like excitations .",
    "experimentally , the proposed array could be realized with cold atoms , in which the necessary ingredients ( fermions subject to spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field,@xcite complex lattices,@xcite and superlattices hosting for instance even resonating valence - bond states@xcite ) have been demonstrated .",
