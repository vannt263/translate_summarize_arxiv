    "charge - parity ( cp ) violation is one of the least understood phenomena in high energy physics . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "cp violation is parametrized by one arbitrary phase in the quark mixing matrix and its value fixed by experimental observations .",
    "models beyond the sm , especially those including supersymmetry , predict several new cp - odd phases .",
    "the effects of some of these phases , particularly the ones coming from the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses , have been studied extensively @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , these phases need to either be unreasonably small , or the scalar fermion masses unusually large @xcite .    a solution to this so called `` susy cp - problem '' has been suggested by the authors in @xcite . by enlarging the supersymmetric gauge sector to be left - right symmetric , parity forces yukawa couplings to be hermitean , and mass terms in the superpotential to be real .",
    "thus the cp problem is solved at the right - handed ( @xmath1 , or seesaw ) scale @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is of the order of the electroweak scale , then no other phase can be generated and the problem is solved . if however @xmath2 is a higher scale , the scenario favored by neutrino masses and grand - unification schemes with left - right models as intermediate steps , this is no longer the case . in some variants of the model ,",
    "the phases appear only at two loop level and are thus naturally small @xcite , in others the electroweak phase is generated form the renormalization group equations evolution from the seesaw scale , and the electron dipole moment ( edm ) problems persist @xcite .",
    "the left - right supersymmetric model ( lrsusy ) enlarges the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) gauge symmetry @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this symmetry allows for the seesaw mechanism within supersymmetry and predicts neutrino masses and mixing naturally . in the supersymmetric sector of the theory",
    ", it introduces right - handed gauginos in addition to several higgsinos .",
    "we expect this change to be most pronounced in the electroweak chargino sector , where previously forbidden right - right interactions are now allowed to proceed with a strength comparable to left - left interactions .",
    "this could have significant effects on the cp - phases in the sector , where more phases are allowed , which could distinguish the model from the mssm .",
    "by contrast , we expect the effect to be less pronounced in the neutralino sector , where right - handed gaugino interactions are permitted in mssm .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the effects of such phases on the masses , production , and decay rates of charginos .",
    "our emphasis is on an analysis of a general unconstrained model , assuming arbitrary phases , and finding the combination of angles that would affect the phenomenology , as well as presenting experimentally testable signals from the chargino sector .",
    "we assume in what follows that the phases can be taken arbitrarily large , and that cp - violation restrictions in the quark and lepton sectors can be satisfied either by allowing scalar masses to be large , or through cancellations of various contributions @xcite .    we perform a detailed and complete analysis of the chargino sector including masses , production rates , forward - backward asymmetry in production and decays . for decays , we chose to analyze the channel most sensitive to left - right symmetry , the decay into a sneutrino and a lepton .",
    "we analyze the dependence on production and subsequent decay from a polarized @xmath0 beam and the t - odd asymmetry associated with this .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we present the general framework of the left - right supersymmetric model with special emphasis on the chargino sector .",
    "we then discuss the chargino masses , with particular attention paid to the effect of the cp - odd angles in section [ sec : masses ] . in section [ sec :",
    "production ] , we investigate the cross section for chargino production in an unpolarized @xmath0 collider and its dependence on the phases in the theory . we discuss the variation of the decay rates of charginos with cp - phases as well as the t - odd asymmetry in polarized production and decay in section [ sec : decays ] . section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our summary and conclusions .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric left - right model is based on the gauge group @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the matter fields of this model consist of three families of both left and right handed quark @xmath5 and lepton @xmath6 fields .",
    "the higgs sector consists of two bidoublet ( @xmath7 ) and four triplet higgs ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) superfields .",
    "the bidoublet higgs superfields implement the @xmath10 symmetry breaking and generate a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "the triplet higgs @xmath11 bosons allow for the seesaw mechanism , while the additional triplet fields @xmath12 are needed to cancel triangle gauge anomalies in the fermionic sector .",
    "the most general superpotential involving these superfields is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the yukawa couplings for the quarks and leptons , respectively and @xmath16 is the coupling for the triplet higgs bosons .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the higgs mass parameters",
    ". left right symmetry requires all @xmath19-matrices to be hermitean in the generation space and @xmath16 matrix to be symmetric . here",
    "@xmath20 denotes ( possible ) non - renormalizable terms arising from higher scale physics or planck scale effects @xcite .",
    "the presence of these terms insures that , when the susy breaking scale is above @xmath21 , the ground state is r - parity conserving .",
    "left - right supersymmetric models have one additional problem : two of the physical higgs bosons can contribute flavor - violating neutral currents ( fcnc ) by violating flavor by two units and by generating too large a contribution to the @xmath22 mass splitting .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by raising the right - handed mass scale to @xmath23 tev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lagrangian also includes soft supersymmetry breaking terms as well as @xmath24- and , @xmath25-terms . for a more detailed description of the model ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the supersymmetric sector of the model",
    "there are six singly - charged charginos , corresponding to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the model also has eleven neutralinos , corresponding to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the doubly charged higgs and higgsinos do not affect quark phenomenology , but the neutral and singly charged components do , through mixings in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices .",
    "the terms relevant to the masses of charginos in the lagrangian are @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 where we have taken , for simplification , @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the bidoublet higgs bosons vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the triplet higgs bosons vevs , and @xmath52 the @xmath53 and @xmath1 gaugino masses , respectively .",
    "the chargino mass eigenstates @xmath54 are obtained by @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 unitary matrices satisfying @xmath58 the diagonalizing matrices @xmath59 and @xmath56 are obtained by computing the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "from the above general mass matrices for charginos , we can obtain analytic expressions for the eigenvalues .",
    "first , note that the vevs of the triplet higgs bosons , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are responsible for giving masses to @xmath62 bosons , as well as implementing the seesaw mechanism .",
    "as such , @xmath63 several tev , and thus we can safely decouple @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the lighter chargino states .",
    "we now incorporate the most general set of cp violating phases in the mass matrix .",
    "that is , we do not restrict the phases according to any particular scenario , and allow the most general set of phases .",
    "these can easily be generated from the rge evolution running down from @xmath2 to the electroweak scale .",
    "since @xmath52 and @xmath66 , the higgsino coupling parameter are assumed complex at the electroweak scale , with nontrivial phases @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , then they can include phases : @xmath69 and , in addition we allow the higgs vacuum expectation values to be complex , with phases @xmath70 : @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the chargino mass matrix @xmath73 with the most general allowed set of @xmath74 violating phases becomes @xmath75 where the phase angles ( i.e. @xmath76 ) are in the interval @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the results in the @xmath78 conserving limit , maybe obtained by simple taking the values @xmath79 or @xmath80 , in the matrix . using the transformation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a unitary matrix .",
    "then the matrix @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 where we have defined @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these phases allow for both explicit and/or spontaneous cp violation ; in the latter case @xmath87 and @xmath88.the dependence with respect to only two angles is now clear .",
    "the phases @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the new sources of @xmath74 violation , which can vary in the range @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively . to diagonalize the matrix @xmath83 we use the following transformation @xmath93v^{-1 } = { \\rm diag}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{m}}_{\\chi^{\\pm}_{1}},\\mathrm{\\tilde{m}}_{\\chi^{\\pm}_{2}},\\mathrm{\\tilde{m}}_{\\chi^{\\pm}_{3}},\\mathrm{\\tilde{m}}_{\\chi^{\\pm}_{4}})\\equiv m_{d}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "<S> the effects of the phases in the left - right supersymmetric chargino sector are different from the minimal supersymmetric standard model , and signals from this sector would be able to distinguish between different gauge symmetries .    </S>",
