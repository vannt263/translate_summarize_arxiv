    "kohn  sham density functional theory  @xcite ( dft ) is now arguably the most popular computational method in theoretical condensed matter physics and materials science .",
    "while the method is exact in principle , in practice it is applied only with approximations to the unknown , exact exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the conventional semilocal approximations often fail to describe the structural , defect , and other properties of materials with strong electron - electron correlations  a failure that is not only quantitative but often qualitative .",
    "indeed , even for less strongly correlated materials where the method yields reasonable predictions , further increases in accuracy are highly desired .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method allows direct solution of the many - body problem of interacting electrons using stochastic techniques  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the local density approximation is based on qmc calculations of the homogeneous electron gas  @xcite ( heg ) .",
    "the only significant source of systematic errors in the qmc method is the fixed - node approximation  @xcite to the fermion sign - problem .",
    "using fixed - nodes , qmc has proven to been very effective in providing high accuracy results for many real systems such as molecules , clusters and solids with hundreds of valence electrons that are within 1 - 3% of experiment  @xcite .",
    "more recently , new techniques have been developed to reduce the fixed - node errors@xcite , further improving the accuracy of the technique .",
    "the spherical jellium system has been extensively investigated as a model of large clusters of simple metals ( see , e.g. , review  [ ] ) . it has been found to have pronounced shell structure with magic numbers @xmath4 approximately corresponding to fully - filled closed shell of each orbital momentum as @xmath5 .",
    "a few benchmark qmc studies exist  @xcite for the total and correlation energies of closed - shells at magic numbers with up to 106 electrons .",
    "these results have been later compared against several dft approximations  @xcite .",
    "surface correlation energies  @xcite and surface exchange - correlation energies  @xcite have been obtained using extrapolated values to infinite size . in general , the values obtained for correlation surface energies obtained with spheres are consistent with the latest dmc results for jellium slabs  @xcite and other methods , but differ to some extent from the original dmc results from slab geometries  @xcite .    in this paper , we benchmark four levels of dft approximations , following the `` jacob s ladder '' metaphor of perdew and co - workers  @xcite , by performing accurate quantum monte carlo calculations on the model of the interacting electron gas subject to a central impurity potential . the interacting electron gas is interpreted as a finite jellium sphere with @xmath6 electrons of average density @xmath7 .",
    "an attractive spherical gaussian of tunable strength at the origin represents the impurity potential .",
    "the proposed system closely relates to an atom in a real material while retaining a simplicity that is amenable to highly accurate solution under a wide range of conditions ( slowly- and rapidly - varying density regions as well as a wide range of density values ) .",
    "the purpose of solving this simple model is to understand the role of electronic correlations and exchange , to understand the features that more sophisticated functional must possess in order to describe , e.g. , strongly correlated materials , and to provide essentially exact benchmarks for testing new dft approximations .",
    "tabulated data of our results is given in electronic physics auxiliary publication service ( epaps ) document no .",
    "one of the simplest ways to neutralize the negative charge of @xmath6 electrons is to consider a sphere of positive charge @xmath8 of uniform density @xmath9 with @xmath7 as adjustable parameter corresponding to a wigner ",
    "seitz radius in solids and @xmath10 as the sphere radius .",
    "this is a basic description of the spherical jellium model .",
    "the external potential due to the positive background is then @xmath11 the hamiltonian of the electronic system ( in atomic units ) has the form @xmath12 where we have introduced the constant coulomb self energy of the positive background as @xmath13 the addition of @xmath14 ensures that in the thermodynamic limit the energy of jellium spheres approaches the energy of heg .      in order to further enhance the inhomogeneity effects in the jellium spheres ,",
    "we propose the addition of the attractive gaussian shaped impurity at the origin .",
    "the external potential is then modified as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the depth and the width of the added gaussian .",
    "the gaussian form for the impurity is not meant to exactly describe core levels of a real atom , but to create additional localization for valence electrons .",
    "moreover , using this model , we can also avoid the locality approximation required to evaluate conventional pseudopotentials  @xcite . as a welcome consequence",
    ", the gaussian potential also preserves the cusp - less property of single - particle orbitals at the origin . to summarize , by controlling the amount of localization at the impurity",
    ", we can alter the shape and occupation order of single - particle states .",
    "we note that a similar potential has been used in studies of hetero - atomic clusters of refs .  .",
    "another possibility to further amplify the inhomogeneity effects in the jellium is to create a spherical jellium shell .",
    "this can be achieved by combining external potentials [ eq .  ( [ eq : vext ] ) ] of a larger system with @xmath18 electrons and smaller system with @xmath19 electrons to form @xmath20 where integer variable @xmath21 controls the geometry of a shell [ inner radius @xmath22 and outer radius @xmath23 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vextshell ] ) the gaussian impurity at the origin is also explicitly included .",
    "above external potential closely resembles the potential of hollow clusters  @xcite .",
    "the difference in our model is the addition of gaussian impurity which attracts electron density towards the origin . in turn",
    ", the enhanced inhomogeneity ( i.e. , charge separation between center and shell ) provides even more severe test for the single - particle methods studied here .",
    "[ methods ] the goal of this paper is to compare the total energies and radial densities of equivalent states of the spherical jellium systems in hartree  fock ( hf ) , dft and quantum monte carlo methods . due to the spherical symmetry of the system and",
    "because the spin - orbit interaction is not considered , the eigenstates of @xmath24 must also be eigenstates of the angular momentum operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , spin operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the advantage of the spherical symmetry is that rigorous upper - bound theorems apply for qmc and ground state dft can be generalized@xcite for the lowest energy state states of each value of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , meaningful phase diagrams can be constructed with each method .      for benchmark purposes ,",
    "we only need to compare equivalent states with dft and qmc . for comparison ,",
    "we have selected states that are likely but not guaranteed to be the minimum energy configurations . since we are concerned with jellium densities of @xmath31 , our system can be characterized as weakly interacting . in this regime",
    "it is a reasonable to assume that , in analogy with atoms and 3d quantum dots  @xcite , the filling of the orbitals within a single shell of spherical jellium follows hund s rules , i.e. , for a given electron configuration , the state with maximum multiplicity ( @xmath32 ) has the lowest energy , and for a given multiplicity , the state with the largest value of @xmath29 is likely to have the lowest energy .",
    "it is straightforward to construct the eigenfunction of @xmath33 symmetry ( in the russell  saunders term symbol notation ) as the slater determinant of single - particle orbitals with occupancies chosen such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    ", the determinants will be complex - valued , an issue important in the qmc context and discussed further bellow .",
    "the original second hund s rule only applies to @xmath37 spherically - symmetric systems , since it involves the total angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "there is debate , however , on the existence and form of a second hund s rule , with redefined shells , in the case of parabolic models of quantum dots in @xmath38 at the highly correlated limit ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "while that debate is interesting , it is beyond the scope of this paper to validate the hund s rules in the range of parameters explored with our @xmath37 models .      to obtain the quantities of interest within single - particle methods",
    "we employ a non - relativistic atomic solver , originally implemented in ref .  [ ] and currently part of the qmcpack suite  @xcite , modified to handle pure hf method , lda , gga , meta - gga and hybrid functionals .",
    "the single - particle orbitals are conveniently expressed as radial - functions @xmath39 multiplied by an angular - part given as a spherical harmonic @xmath40 .",
    "this choice ensures well defined quantum numbers .",
    "the radial equations [ @xmath39 ] are iteratively solved via numerov algorithm on a large logarithmic grid ( @xmath42 5000 points ) until the tight convergence criteria are met ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . for the later cases of the open shells we use the spin - unrestricted formulation of the hf and dft theories . in short , in our formulation , we perform the spin - dependent average of the effective potentials within each sub - shell of the same @xmath45 and @xmath46 , resulting in a single radial function . as we discuss in the next subsection , these radial functions",
    "are then directly imported into qmc methods .",
    "in general , the kohn  sham and hf wave functions have a form of a single slater determinant and are explicit eigenstates of @xmath28 , but they are eigenstates of @xmath27 only if @xmath47 has the maximum value",
    ". therefore , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 eigenstates with maximum multiplicity ( @xmath32 ) and with the largest value of @xmath29 automatically have the correct spin symmetry .    in order to simplify the dft implementation , for open shell cases , we have neglected the angular dependence of the spin - densities for calculation of the exchange - correlation .",
    "this treatment is commonly known as the spherical approximation used in many dft atomic solvers for production of pseudopotentials . a very good numerical agreement ( better than 1 mha )",
    "was achieved between our and other atomic solvers ( opium  @xcite , fhi98pp  @xcite and ape  @xcite ) for several open and closed shell atomic states and functionals .",

    "the trial many - body wave function serves as the most important input for the quantum monte carlo methods within the fixed - node diffusion monte carlo approach . for this problem , following the approach used in previous studies  @xcite , we choose a many - body wavefunction that is a product of spin - up and spin - down slater determinants ( @xmath48 ) and a jastrow correlation factor ( @xmath49 ) , written as @xmath50\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times d[\\varphi^{\\downarrow}_{1}({\\bf r}_{m+1}),\\ldots,\\varphi^{\\downarrow}_{n - m}({\\bf r}_n ) ] \\nonumber\\\\   & \\times\\exp[j({\\bf r}_1 , { \\bf r}_2 , \\ldots , { \\bf r}_n)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming the first @xmath19 electrons to be spin - up and the remaining @xmath51 to be spin - down .",
    "the slater determinants are constructed from orbitals generated in single - particle methods and have a form @xmath52 the symmetric jastrow correlation factor includes well - known electron - electron cusp conditions as well as one and two - body correlation functions ( for details see , e.g. , ref .  [ ] ) . as a note",
    ", we did not find it necessary to include the multipolar terms into the jastrow factor as in ref .  .",
    "the jastrow term is further variationally optimized  @xcite .",
    "the optimal @xmath53 is then used in diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method to obtain the ground state fixed - node ( fn ) energies and other expectation values of the system .",
    "as a additional step , for selected states , we also perform reptation monte carlo ( rmc ) calculations  @xcite to obtain pure expectation values of the fixed - node densities .",
    "all the qmc calculations were performed using qwalk code  @xcite .    as we have already mentioned , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 eigenfunctions considered in this paper with @xmath36 are complex - valued and require the use of the fixed - phase dmc algorithm@xcite . however , the associated fixed - phase errors are in general different ( and possibly larger ) than the fixed - node errors for real - valued wavefunctions@xcite . to avoid mixing results with two different approximations",
    ", we exclusively use the real - valued @xmath54 projections of the same @xmath55 eigenfunction ( as they are energetically degenerate ) .",
    "the @xmath54 projections can be readily obtained from @xmath56 states by the recursive application of the momentum lowering @xmath57 operator . as a consequence ,",
    "the complex - valued single slater determinant is replaced by the real - valued linear combination of slater determinants .",
    "please refer to the appendix for the linear combinations used for each open shell state .",
    "[ results ]      to test the numerical implementation of our hf , dft and fixed - node ( fn ) dmc methods we have recalculated previous results for the closed - shell jellium spheres .",
    "we achieve an excellent agreement with the pw lda and pbe gga energies of ref .   and with tpss meta - gga energies of ref .  .",
    "obtained results for hf energies are identical to ref .   for model sodium clusters of @xmath58 with up to 196 electrons .",
    "however , we find lower hf energies ( by @xmath59 mha per electron ) when compared to energies of ref .  .",
    "this is most likely due to the non - self consistent treatment of hf in ref .  .",
    "finally , all our fn - dmc energies using lda orbitals are within error - bars of fn - dmc energies of the ref .  .",
    "the sole exception is the 2 electron system at @xmath60 , where the differences are larger .",
    "the single limitation for the dmc calculations comes from the use of fixed - node approximation .",
    "introduced fixed - node errors can be reduced by expanding the trial wave function in multi - determinants  @xcite or by using the backflow correlation corrections  @xcite , or both .",
    "previously , it was found that the qmc calculations for the closed shell jellium spheres@xcite did not suffer from large fixed - node errors ( by comparing to fn - dmc results with small multi - determinant expansions  @xcite ) . in order to systematically check for these errors ,",
    "we have extended the previous fn - dmc calculations to include backflow correlations for all the densities and particle numbers .",
    "we find small and uniform gains to correlation energies on the order of 0.3 mha per electron .",
    "therefore , it is very reasonable to assume that , for the energy differences considered here , these small corrections cancel out .",
    "the excellent agreement for the closed - shell energies of jellium spheres , obtained with both with qmc and dft methods , with earlier publications gives us confidence to study open shells .",
    "as the first testing case , we have selected a jellium sphere with 18 electrons , which for the impurity free system is one of the fully - filled closed shells and corresponds to a cluster with a stable configuration .",
    "as we increase the attractive gaussian potential of the impurity , the nearest unoccupied @xmath61 level is lowered in energy below the @xmath62 level .",
    "interestingly , exactly the same crossing of the levels was previously observed in the context of hetero - atomic clusters  @xcite and 3d quantum dots  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the ground state of the system will change from closed shell occupation @xmath63 to either @xmath64 or @xmath65 open shell occupations . as a note ,",
    "each state differs in occupation in more than one shell ( @xmath62 and @xmath61 ) while hund s rules strictly apply only to occupations within a single shell .",
    "the phase diagram depends on the variables @xmath7 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we limit our discussion to realistic density range between @xmath60 and @xmath66 found in the majority of bulk systems .",
    "since the @xmath17 and @xmath16 parameters are effectively coupled together , we choose to fix the width of the gaussian at @xmath67 and vary only its depth @xmath16 . as a result , we find robust @xmath2 transitions within @xmath68 .",
    "we summarize our calculations in the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ phase_space_d_shell ] .",
    "there are several general observations which can be drawn from the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ phase_space_d_shell ] .",
    "as we increase the attractiveness of the impurity , we see changes on the occupation of a more delocalized @xmath62 orbital to more localized atomic - like @xmath61 orbital in the following order : @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , we notice the existence of high density region ( @xmath70 ) which has always partial @xmath61 occupation ( see also table  [ correctiontable ] ) .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied the performance of a variety of dft functionals with increasing complexity against quantum monte carlo benchmark in a spherical jellium model and an spherical shell model with an attractive gaussian impurity at the center .",
    "the tunable strength of the impurity allowed us to find a number of interesting transitions between closed and open shell states .",
    "our results shows that the development of better density functional approximation is increasingly required as the system departs from the perfect spherical jellium case .",
    "we report several regions where the employed approximations of dft fail to find the same ground state as identified with qmc methods .",
    "the @xmath2 transitions in 18 electron system are well described on the highest semilocal level ( tpss meta - gga ) as well in global hybrid ( pbe0 ) dft . on the other hand ,",
    "not all @xmath74 transitions in the 30 electron system were accurately captured .",
    "we argue that even as the inhomogeneity effects in the density are relatively small and well captured by the semilocal functionals , full non - local exchange is needed to accurately describe the system .",
    "our work therefore further supports the need for the hyper - gga functionals  @xcite with fully non - local exchange and accompanying balanced correlation .    in the spherical jellium - shell model with an impurity at the center , where the inhomogeneity in the electronic density is increased , the dft methods with",
    "exact - exchange give better agreement for the studied transitions .",
    "the radial electron densities in the inner region closest to the impurity are correctly described at the hf level , while lda and pbe gga are more accurate in the outer region .",
