    "1998 ) , and to be interacting actively with the ambient medium .",
    "these points make the remnant one of the most extensively observed and studied snrs .",
    "many x - ray studies were performed to understand the spatial structures and spectral properties of the remnant @xcite . also , @xcite provided results from gamma - ray measurements . details of many optical filaments , including balmer filaments , were analyzed in various optical studies @xcite .",

    "the global ir images were presented by @xcite and @xcite , and the high resolution ir images of a non - radiative shock were presented by @xcite .",
    "radio continuum studies at various frequencies provided results for spectral indices and polarization properties @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite presented the results of the 21 cm observations over various velocity channels . in all wavelength ranges",
    ", the global structure of the cygnus loop is well defined to be a shell - like feature with a south extension , and the outer rim of the shell is much brighter than the inner region .",
    "this morphology can be explained by a scenario in which the cygnus loop exploded in a cavity , and its blast wave is now hitting the walls of the cavity @xcite .",
    "many of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations for various optical filaments were made and several fuv emission lines originating from non - radiative or radiative shocks were detected and analyzed @xcite . however , the entire region of the cygnus loop was analyzed in only a few fuv studies .",
    "@xcite reported maps of whole regions in the @xmath0977 and @xmath11032 , 1038 emission lines using the _ voyager 2 _ ultraviolet spectrometer , and @xcite presented those in the @xmath11032 , 1038 emission lines by a rocket - borne experiment , high resolution emission line spectrometer ( hires ) .",
    "the spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical radiation ( spear ) , also known as far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( fims ) , carried out the global fuv observation of the cygnus loop in two wavelength channels , 9001150  and 13401750  .",
    "@xcite reported the early results using only the long wavelength channel data .",
    "they showed the + @xmath11400 , 1403 ( unresolved ) , @xmath11548 , 1551 , @xmath01640.5 , and @xmath11661 , 1666 emission - line images , which were similar to the x - ray , optical , and radio - continuum images .",
    "they also presented the spectra in the 13401750  range and estimated shock velocities from the line ratio of to .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the short wavelength channel data of the spear / fims observations and obtain new spectral images in the long wavelength channel .",
    "we create the @xmath0977 and @xmath11032 , 1038 emission - line images of the cygnus loop and compare them with the previous results .",
    "we separate out the blended + image , originally presented in @xcite , into two individual images of and . a new image at @xmath01486 is also presented with the newly processed spear / fims data .",
    "next , we compare the resulting fuv images with the x - ray , optical , and 21 cm images , and discuss the fuv properties of the cygnus loop on a global scale . from the newly processed data , we update the previous results for the fuv line intensities , ratios , and luminosities .",
    "spear / fims is a dual - channel fuv imaging spectrograph for observing diffuse fuv emissions from the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    ", we utilized the data obtained from a total of 43 orbits .",
    "we improved the accuracy of the attitude knowledge up to 5@xmath7 by using an updated version ( for sky - survey data ) of the software - correction code used in @xcite .",
    "the procedure of correction was briefly described in @xcite .",
    "we used the healpix pixelization scheme @xcite to make images and spectra .",
    "a pixel size of @xmath23@xmath7.4 ( healpix resolution parameter ` nside ` = 1024 ) and a wavelength bin size of 0.5  were selected for the s - channel . on the other hand , ` nside ` = 2048 and 1  were used for the l - channel . to mask the pixels including fuv - bright stars",
    ", we identified early - type stars in the area of present concern using the _ td-1 _ catalog , and removed a total of 15 stars in the l - channel and 3 stars in the s - channel .",
    "for emission - line images , the spectrum extracted from each pixel was divided into small segments including individual emission lines . then each segment was fitted with gaussian line profiles plus a linear continuum . for better statistics ,",
    "the pixel size was increased to @xmath26@xmath7.8 ( ` nside ` = 512 ) and the pixels with exposure time of @xmath91 second were excluded before the spectral fitting .",
    "we fixed the central wavelengths and widths of the gaussian functions , to be the calibrated line centers and the spectral resolutions , respectively . the intrinsic line ratios of 2:1 for the @xmath11031.9 , 1037.6 and @xmath11548.2 , 1550.8 doublet lines approach 1:1 in an optically thick case due to resonant scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set the ratios for the doublet lines to vary between 1:1 and 2:1 . the lines at 1660.8 and 1666.1  were assumed to have an intensity ratio of 0.34:1 , according to their statistical weights .",
    "we also attempted to fit the + line complexes as follows .",
    "we assumed that the lines are a doublet line at 1393.8 and 1402.8  , while the lines are a quintet of lines at 1397.2 , 1399.8 , 1401.2 , 1404.8 , and 1407.4  .",
    "however , since the @xmath01402.8  line was unable to be resolved from the quintet lines , only the @xmath01393.8  line was fitted along with the quintet lines .",
    "the strength of the @xmath01402.8 line was assumed to be half that of the @xmath01393.8 line , although it would be valid only in an optically thin case .",

    ", we will compare the fuv images with the optical images . since the resonance line is formed at roughly the same temperature as the [ ] @xmath05007 forbidden line @xcite , figure 2(b ) could directly provide clues to the regions where strong resonance - scattering occurs .",

    "therefore , the absence of the vertical feature in the image may not be due to the effect of resonance scattering , but instead be due to dust extinction by a foreground dust cloud . the optical , vertical filamentary feature",
    "would not be extinguished even by the foreground dust cloud because of much weaker dust extinction in optical wavelengths .",
    "this might be another case of the cloud displayed in figure 2(f ) , which has been considered to be on the front side of the cygnus loop , as noted in section 3 .",

    "the intensity becomes higher toward both ends of the filamentary feature , but the intensity is highest near the center of subregion w. in the shock models of figure 4(a ) , the line ratio / increases with the relative fraction of fast shocks . it should be noted that the positions with higher / on each filamentary feature are closer to the locations of bright x - ray peaks seen in figure 2(e ) .",
    "this is compatible with the above argument about shock - velocity populations .",
    "as mentioned above , figure 2(e ) shows close coincidence between the spear / fims and the x - ray peaks ; particularly the northern and the western peaks .",
    "the bright region on the eastern side of the image is well correlated with the overlapped x - ray peaks there .",
    "an extended , fainter region on the southwestern side also overlaps well with the v - shaped x - ray feature @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the and x - ray images indicates that the observed emissions are mostly originating from the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the only enhanced region without bright x - ray counterparts is located on the northwestern side , which overlaps with the northern part of the optical features in subregion carrot . to estimate the amount of the contribution by x - ray emitting gas , we compared the observed intensity with the value expected from the observed x - ray emissions .",

    "however , their two - ei model predicts only 8% of the observed intensity .",
    "these indicate that most of the emissions near the northern peak can be interpreted to originate from the x - ray emitting gas of which the softer x - ray component is in the condition of equilibrium ionization , and the harder one is in the non - equilibrium ionization condition ( ei + nei model of @xcite ) .",
    "the fuv line luminosities in table 1 are now compared with the previous results . for the and lines ,",
    "we compare the observed intensities , which were not reddening - corrected , because of high uncertainty in the reddening - correction .",
    "@xcite reported the average observed intensities of 4.0 @xmath4 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 for and 8.8 @xmath4 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 for . on the other hand , @xcite obtained the intensity of 3.0(@xmath221.2 ) @xmath4 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 .",
    "fitting the spectrum for the whole region in figure 3 results in the observed intensities of 2.22(@xmath220.46 ) @xmath4 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 for and 4.22(@xmath220.86 ) @xmath4 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 for .",
    "these values are roughly half the _ voyager 2 _ values @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have recently recalibrated the _ voyager 2 _ intensities and found the old values to be too high by a factor of 2 , meaning that our values are similar to the corrected _ voyager 2 _ values .",
    "the hires value @xcite also agrees well with our intensity within 1 @xmath17 error .",
    "we note that the spear / fims systematic errors for the sensitivity calibration were estimated to be @xmath225% @xcite .",
    "if the same distance as in @xcite is adopted , the present luminosity for the whole region is almost exactly the same as that of @xcite .",
    "the and luminosities , however , are @xmath27080% higher than those of @xcite . the difference in the line - fitting methods , as mentioned above , likely caused the larger gaps for the weaker emission lines .",
    "@xcite assumed a fixed ratio of 1:5.5 for the blended + lines to calculate the to ratio .",
    "this caused a somewhat higher line ratio in subregion xa than those in the other parts of the cygnus loop .",
    "@xcite discussed that the to ratio in subregion xa would in fact , be lower than 5.5 , based on the result of @xcite .",
    "the decomposed line luminosities of and in table 1 verify their argument .",
    "the to ratio for the whole region is @xmath25.1 , whereas the ratio for subregion xa+ne is @xmath21.7 .",
    "fitting the spectrum extracted from only subregion xa , results in the ratio of @xmath22.6 .",
    "the relative increase of the line in subregion xa+ne can be recognized in the spectra of figure 3 .    in estimating shock velocities from comparisons between the observed fuv emission lines and radiative shock models",
    ", we should consider the effects of resonance scattering , x - ray emitting gas , and non - radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "the to ratio is not affected by the above effects .",
    "therefore , the fact that the values of the power - law indices obtained from the to ratio in figure 4(a ) are not derived well from the other line ratios , implies that the above effects are indeed important in the line ratios containing the , , and lines .",
    "we , therefore , can infer the importance of the above effects in figures 4(b)(d ) . in figure 4(b ) , the observed ratios / and / are found to be much lower than the values expected from the ratio / for most subregions .",
    "this indicates that the intensities were significantly diminished by the resonance scattering , which is ubiquitous across the cygnus loop . the resonance scattering in subregions ne and w seems to be particularly strong ( reduced by a factor of @xmath133 and @xmath132 , respectively ) . within our wide subregions ,",
    "overlapping projections of the less edge - on shocks may cause a significant contribution from diffuse emission , in which the resonance scattering effect is less important . the contribution would depend on the nature of the ripples in the shock front .",
    "however , more numerous optical filaments in subregions ne and w than the other subregions , indicate the significance of the resonance scattering in subregions ne and w. a kinematic study of the whole cygnus loop region showed that the radial velocities around subregions ne and w are similar to the systemic velocity of the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "even the ratios for the whole region are reduced to @xmath265% of the expected values .",
    "since the resonant scattering does not destroy photons , the decrease of the line ratios obtained from the whole region implies that the cygnus loop would neither be perfectly spherical nor be homogeneous .",
    "another possibility would be the depletion onto dust grains .",
    "a global ir study of the cygnus loop showed that there is plenty of dust correlated well with the x - ray and optical emission of the remnant @xcite .",
    "also , some x - ray studies suggested that a possible explanation of the low abundance in the overall rim of the cygnus loop could be the dust depletion @xcite .",
    "the difference in the degree of dust depletion for carbon and oxygen may affect the ratios / and /.",
    "as @xcite presented clear evidence for resonance scattering of in a northeastern non - radiative shock , resonance scattering of can also be widespread throughout the cygnus loop .",
    "however , figure 4(c ) does not show any decrease in the line ratio for .",
    "instead , the line ratio seems to increase for some subregions , although their errors are somewhat large .",
    "the ratios for the whole region are higher by a factor of @xmath132 than the values matching with the ratio /.",
    "these enhancements can be explained by the above conclusion that large portions of the observed emissions would be due to the x - ray emitting gas . moreover , since the x - ray emitting gas fills more diffuse and larger volumes inside the radiative shocks @xcite , the emissions from the x - ray gas are less affected by resonance scattering .",
    "figure 4(d ) for the line shows no clear tendency . only in subregion",
    "n , ratios are found to be slightly higher than those expected .",
    "this may be due to a relatively large number of non - radiative shocks within subregion n because some portions of the intensity can originate from non - radiative shocks @xcite .    in table 1 , the luminosities of the x - ray and the highest ionization fuv line ( ) for the cygnus loop are @xmath280% and @xmath230% higher than those for the vela snr , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosities of the other fuv lines for the cygnus loop are all @xmath23070% lower than those for the vela snr .",
    "we note that the ratios of the x - ray and luminosities to those of the lower ionization lines are higher in the cygnus loop than in the vela snr . although the distances to the cygnus loop was recently found to be larger than the value adopted in the present paper @xcite , the luminosity ratios are independent of the distance .",
    "therefore , our result suggests that the cygnus loop must possess a much larger fraction of shocks in the early evolutionary stages than the vela snr .",
    "we conclude that the cygnus loop is globally younger than the vela snr from the point of view of shock evolution populations .",
    "in fact , the vela snr exploded near the border of the @xmath31 velorum stellar wind bubble and large portions of the remnant have already passed through the dense wall of the bubble @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the cygnus loop exploded near the center of a cavity formed by its progenitor star and it has recently encountered the cavity walls @xcite .",
    "utilizing the short wavelength channel data of spear / fims , we have obtained new spectral images of the cygnus loop at @xmath0977 and @xmath11032 , 1038 .",
    "these images supplement the previously reported images with the slit sampling effects or a little worse resolution .",
    "the observed intensities agree with the hires value within 1 @xmath17 error .",
    "they are also consistent with the recently recalibrated _ voyager 2 _ values .",
    "in addition , the + lines unresolved in @xcite have been successfully decomposed .",
    "a new image for the weak @xmath01486 line was also obtained by binning and fitting the spectra carefully with the newly processed data .",
    "the deblended and line maps confirm a region with a relatively low to ratio , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "we have compared the spear / fims fuv images with the x - ray , optical , and 21 cm images .",
    "the very close coincidence between the and x - ray enhanced regions suggests that the observed emissions are most likely related to x - ray emitting gas . for the region around the northern peak , comparison of the observed intensity with the value predicted from the observed x - ray emissions indicates that most of the emissions observed there can be produced from the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "comparisons with the optical h@xmath6 and [ ] @xmath05007 images have revealed clear variations of shock - velocity populations on the two filamentary features .",
    "we also argue that the fuv lines may be strongly extinguished in the direction of the previously identified cloud , which would be located on the front side of the cygnus loop .",
    "we have calculated the fuv line ratios for several subregions of the cygnus loop , and compared them with a radiative shock model . from this , we have diagnosed subregions containing relatively large fractions of slow or fast radiative shocks , and also obtained clues to the effects of resonance scattering , x - ray emitting gas , and non - radiative shocks . in particular , it has been confirmed that the resonance scattering in the regions viewed edge - on is much higher than in the other regions .",
    "the x - ray and fuv luminosities of the cygnus loop calculated from a revised distance have been compared with those of the vela snr . in the cygnus loop ,",
    "the x - ray and luminosities relative to those of the other lower ionization fuv lines are higher than the vela snr .",
    "this suggests that the cygnus loop contains a much larger fraction of shocks in the early evolutionary stages than the vela snr .",
