    "since the discovery of the first two blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies by sargent & searle ( 1970 ) and searle & sargent ( 1972 ) , and their identification by thuan & martin ( 1981 ) as a class of low - luminosity metal - deficient objects , the importance of these galaxies has increased .",
    "bcd galaxies are characterized by strong episodes of star formation as evidenced by the blue optical colors and the presence of bright emission lines in the optical spectra .",
    "they span a range of metallicities that goes from about a third solar down to @xmath0/51 for i  zw  18 , indicating a non - uniform star formation history possibly undergoing episodic bursts thuan ( 1991 ) .",
    "the importance of these galaxies is obvious since they are forming stars in an environment that must be similar to that expected in primeval galaxies ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "for this reason they are unique laboratories to study star formation as it occurred in the universe during its earliest phases .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have proposed , based on an extensive study of a sample of bcd galaxies , to use the oxygen abundance as an age indicator ; all galaxies with 12+log(o / h)@xmath1 7.6 would be younger than 40 gyr .",
    "however single star photometry of one bcd galaxy showed that this limit is actually 1 gyr ( izotov & thuan 2002 ) .",
    "another approach to the problem of the age is the study of the stellar populations based on deep multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "nir colors are effective indicators of the age of a stellar population once the metallicity is known",
    ". however vanzi et al . ( 2000 ) point out how , though the nir colors of normal , active and starburst galaxies are fairly well understood , their interpretation in bcds is not easy and certainly not free from ambiguity .",
    "this is mainly due to two factors , 1 ) the broadband photometry of bcds is strongly affected by nebular emission and no reliable conclusion on the stellar population can be driven without correcting the colors for this effect , 2 ) the interpretation of the colors is complicated by the difficultiy of incorporating the effect of metallicity into the evolutionary models in a satisfactory way .",
    "the case of sbs  0335 - 052 ( the second lowest metallicity bcd with @xmath0/40 ) is a good testbench since none of the currently available models is able to reproduce the colors of this galaxy even after taking into account the nebular contribution . to measure",
    "the nebular contribution spectroscopy is necessary .",
    "nir spectra also offer the unique opportunity to probe the molecular hydrogen warm phase and to study a number of features not accesible at other wavelengths .",
    "our main motivation for studying bcds with @xmath2 is to link the well - studied extremely metal deficient bcds , like i  zw  18 and sbs  0335 - 052 , with the dwarf irregulars at the other end of the metallicity range , such as the lmc ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the fact that the properties of sub - solar and very low metallicity dwarf galaxies could be smoothly connected is suggested by the finding of guseva et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the number of wolf - rayet stars in these galaxies is an increasing function of the metallicity in agreement with the predictions of the models .",
    "we are particularly interested in the photometric and spectroscopic properties of bcds , their star - formation process , dust , gas and @xmath4 content as a function of the metallicity .",
    "it is our opinion that this approach can put important constraints on the star formation history of bcds and on star formation models .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our new observations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the discussion of the spectra and section 4 to the images . in section 5",
    "we summarize the conclusions of our work .",
    "we have selected tol  35 , tol  3 and um  462 as representative of star formation at intermediate sub - solar metallicity .",
    "their abundances are @xmath0/6 for tol  35 and tol  3 ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "1999 ) and @xmath0/9 for um  462 ( izotov & thuan 1998 , guseva et al .",
    "all three galaxies display the wolf - rayet features at 4686    ( vacca & conti 1992 , schaerer et al . 1999 ,",
    "guseva et al 2000 ) .",
    "this is indicative of a recent and short star formation episode as shown by the evolution of the number of wr over o stars predicted by single population evolutionary models ( e.g. leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "we have calculated distances to the sample galaxies using a hubble constant @xmath5 of 70 km / s / mpc , and the virgo nonlinear flow model defined by kraan - korteweg ( 1986 ) and giovanardi ( 2002 ) . with this @xmath5 and the model of kraan - korteweg ,",
    "the virgo distance is 17.0 mpc the characteristics of the galaxies are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".observational characteristics of the sample galaxies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to derive the number of equivalent o7v stars in the regions observed spectroscopically and listed in table [ colors ] , we first correct the br@xmath6 fluxes for extinction , then multiply by 35.94 to convert to h@xmath7 fluxes ( for 100 @xmath8 and t = 10000 k , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "we then convert the h@xmath7 fluxes to the number of lyman continuum photons using the conversion factor given by guseva et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . adopting 10@xmath9 s@xmath10 as the number of lyman continuum photons for an o7v star , we obtain 462 o7v stars in tol3 a , 1435 o7v stars in tol 35 a , 695 o7v stars in tol3 b , and 307 o7v stars in um462 - 1 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes , size and number of stars of the clusters observed are indicative of super star clusters ( sscs ) ( billet et al .",
    "2002 , whitmore 2000 ) .",
    "the sscs in um462 vary in nir color , and appear to follow a trend with age or gas fraction or both .",
    "knot # 1 has the reddest @xmath11 and bluest @xmath12 color , followed by the two nearest knots ( # 2 and # 6 ) .",
    "while @xmath11 gets bluer with increasing knot number ( and distance from knot # 1 ) , @xmath12 remains roughly constant at 0.4 also for knots # 3 and # 5 , but gets redder for knot # 4 .",
    "such a trend suggests a decreasing gas fraction ( because of the decreasing @xmath11 color ) going from knot # 1 , # 2 , # 6 , to knot # 4 .",
    "this may also be interpreted as an age trend , since gas fraction decreases with age , and @xmath12 for knot # 4 is slightly redder . without spectral information for the different knots , it is difficult to be more definite .",
    "nevertheless , the colors of the knots in um462 suggests that the star formation in knot is # 1 is more recent than that in the remaining knots ; knot # 4 appears to be the oldest .",
    "the knots in tol3 show similar trends , with knot b appearing to be older than knot a. this is suggestive of propagating star formation , with the shock waves triggered by supernovae in the older knots triggering star formation in the younger knots .",
    "the main results of this work are the following :    1 .",
    "we have obtained nir spectra and images of tol  35 , tol  3 and um  462 and detected bright hii regions in all them .",
    "the star - formation episodes are very young in the brightest regions , not older than few myr .",
    "molecular hydrogen lines are present in all galaxies , and trends with metallicity suggest that in bcds @xmath4 is clumpy , rather than diffuse .",
    "@xmath13 band gas fractions range from 3 to 40 % , implying that ionized gas significantly affects broadband colors .",
    "4 .   in all galaxies",
    "we detect the presence of super star clusters .",
    "there are six of them in um  462 , arranged in an age or decreasing gas fraction sequence .",
    "the sscs contain several hundred to more than 1000 o7v stars .",
    "the low - surface brightness envelopes of all galaxies have nir colors representative of evolved star ."
