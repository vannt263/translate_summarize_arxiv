    "our model with the parameters in subsection 3.1 explains the hyperon and anti - hyperon polarizations both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions well . from our analysis , we expect that the incident spin-1/2 baryon is mainly composed of a spin-0 valence diquark and a valence quark , but contains about 10@xmath0 of spin-1 valence diquarks .",
    "further , it appears that there is an intrinsic antidiquark with a probability of about 7@xmath0 .",
    "the complex hyperon polarizations may be explained by considering the leading particle effects of valence constituents and by taking into account the contributions of the decay products from resonances .",
    "polarizations of hyperons having a common diquark with the projectile , such as @xmath199 and @xmath6 , in unpolarized @xmath1 collisions hardly depend on the center - of - mass energy @xmath200 , and those of hyperons having only one common quark with the projectile , such as @xmath201 and @xmath173 in @xmath1 collisions , depend on @xmath200 .",
    "the target mass number dependence of polarizations of hyperons is low .",
    "the energy dependence of hyperon polarization in @xmath2 collisions is small due to the strangeness of the incident valence diquark .",
    "our approach is applicable to small @xmath181 regions ( @xmath23gev / c ) , while the approaches based on qcd factorization are mainly applicable to large @xmath181 regions ( @xmath202gev / c ) .",
    "thus , there is no direct correspondence between these approaches .",
    "however , it is an important problem to research a relation of our model to qcd factorization model",
    ". we will investigate this problem as one of future works .",
