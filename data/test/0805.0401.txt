    "the left - right ( lr ) symmetric model @xcite , based on the gauge group @xmath3 , is an attractive extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the symmetry requires the introduction of right - handed partners for the observed gauge bosons and neutrinos , and a higgs sector containing one bi - doublet @xmath4 ( 2,2,0 ) , one left - handed triplet @xmath5 ( 3,1,2 ) and one right - handed triplet @xmath6 ( 1,3,2 ) .",
    "in such a minimal lr symmetric model , parity is an exact symmetry of the theory at high energy scale , and is broken spontaneously at low energy scale due to the asymmetric vacuum .",
    "also cp asymmetry can be realized as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking , namely the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) @xcite .",
    "however , such a scenario suffers from nontrivial constraints from the vacuum minimization conditions .",
    "it is explicitly demonstrated that the scpv is not so easily realized if all the parameters in the higgs potential are real and endowed with natural values @xcite .",
    "the difficulty results from the facts that one of the neutral higgs bosons carries dangerous tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) effect , and that quark flavor mixing angles and cp violating phase are all calculable quantities due to the lr symmetry .",
    "therefore , many generalized cp violation scenarios beyond the scpv case have been analyzed extensively @xcite . in these literatures ,",
    "the masses of right - handed gauge boson @xmath7 and the fcnc higgs boson are strongly constrained from low energy phenomenology .",
    "although the ckm matrix are more general not to be fully fixed than the scpv case , it is proved that there is only one physical complex phase in the yukawa couplings @xcite . hence the fcnc higgs boson s couplings ca nt be absolutely free .",
    "the fcnc higgs boson s mass still accepts strict bound . in terms of these observations , a generalized two higgs bi - doublets model is proposed @xcite . in this model ,",
    "quark mass matrices become far more flexible and the fcnc higgs boson s yukawa couplings are now free parameters .",
    "thereby low energy bound on the right - handed scale is largely alleviated .",
    "as other generalized models , the two higgs bi - doublets version of lr model also has the advantage to realize the scpv without the fine - tuning problem .",
    "the lr symmetric model is also motivated to explain the very tiny neutrino masses .",
    "when the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath8 of the neutral component of @xmath6 is very huge , typically of order @xmath9 gev , the well - known seesaw mechanism provides a very natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "however , the right - handed gauge bosons @xmath10 and @xmath7 are too heavy to be detected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the future colliders . to allow for the possibility of an observable right - handed scale , many authors focus on the @xmath11 tev case .",
    "although the seesaw mechanism can work well , we have to face the so - called vev - seesaw puzzle .",
    "namely , @xmath12 is of order @xmath13 rather than the anticipant @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are located in the higgs potential .",
    "one may introduce a discrete @xmath17 symmetry @xmath18 and @xmath19 to resolve this vev - seesaw problem @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that neutrinos are the dirac particles in this scenario .",
    "if we preserve the majorana yukawa couplings , the corresponding model must lie beyond the lr symmetric model .",
    "the @xmath17 symmetry leads to the absence of both @xmath16-type terms and the majorana yukawa couplings , hence @xmath20 due to the minimization conditions .",
    "furthermore , we find that the neutral higgs bosons @xmath21 and @xmath22 are a pair of stable weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "this is an important feature of our scenario which hasnt been indicated before .",
    "it is a natural idea that @xmath21 and @xmath22 may be the cold dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "we firstly calculate the wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross section which has been strongly constrained by the direct dark matter detection experiments , such as the cdms@xcite and xenon@xcite .",
    "however , our result is 3 - 5 orders of magnitude above the present bounds for @xmath23 gev @xcite . to avoid this puzzle , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ca nt dominate all the dark matter . we find that our scenario is consistent with the direct dark matter detection experiments only when @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total relic number density of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this bound requires the dark matter annihilation cross sections must be very large . in this work",
    ", we examine whether our scenario can provide very large annihilation cross sections so as to derive the desired relic abundance .",
    "in this paper we try to give a comprehensive analysis on these lr models with general parameter setting .",
    "firstly , we perform a detailed investigation on the simplest lr model with one higgs bi - doublet , in which there are no any cp violation phases .",
    "then we generalize the simplest lr model to some other more complicated situations .",
    "it turns out that there s no significant differences among these one higgs bi - doublet versions of lr model because the gauge and higgs sectors are basically the same .",
    "whereas in the two higgs bi - doublet case , there would be more higgs bosons and the yukawa couplings might be quite different . hence more delicate analysis is needed .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the main features of the lr symmetric model and discuss the vev - seesaw problem . in section iii and iv ,",
    "the direct dark matter detection experiments put very strong constraints on the relic number density and the annihilation cross sections . in section v , we analyze whether the simplest lr model can be consistent with the above constraints or not .",
    "then we generalize the simplest lr model to the two higgs bi - doublets case in sec vi .",
    "the summary and comments are given in section vii .",
    "the minimal lr symmetric model consists of one higgs bi - doublet @xmath4 ( 2,2,0 ) , one left - handed higgs triplet @xmath5 ( 3,1,2 ) and one right - handed higgs triplet @xmath6 ( 1,3,2 ) , which can be written as @xmath26 after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs multiplets can have the following vacuum expectation values @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath8 are in general complex . without loss of generality , one can choose @xmath28 and @xmath8 to be real , while assign complex phases @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath30 , respectively . following the requirements of the lr symmetry , we can write down the most general form of the higgs potential @xcite @xmath34 \\right ) - \\mu_2 ^ 2\\left({\\rm tr } \\left[\\tilde{\\phi}\\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr}\\left[\\tilde{\\phi% } ^{\\dagger } \\phi \\right ] \\right ) -\\mu_3 ^ 2 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\lambda_1 \\left ( \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right)^2 \\right)+ \\lambda_2 \\left ( \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi } \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right)^2 + \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\dagger } \\phi \\right ] \\right)^2 \\right ) + \\lambda_3 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi } \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\dagger } \\phi \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\lambda_4 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi } \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\dagger } \\phi \\right ] \\right ) \\right )   + \\rho_1 \\left ( \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right)^2+\\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right)^2 \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\rho_2 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r \\right]{\\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right ) + \\rho_3 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\rho_4 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r \\right ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha_1 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha_2 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\dagger } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right]+ { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi^{\\dagger } \\tilde{\\phi } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha^\\ast_2 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi^{\\dagger } \\tilde{\\phi } \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right]+ { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\dagger } \\phi \\right ] { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha_3 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\delta_l \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi^{\\dagger } \\phi \\delta_r \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\beta_1 \\left ( { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi \\delta_r \\phi^{\\dagger } \\delta_l^{\\dagger } \\right ] + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\phi^{\\dagger } \\delta_l \\phi \\delta_r^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\right )   + \\beta_2 \\left ( { \\rm tr }",
