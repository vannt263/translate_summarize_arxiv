    "different experiments measuring high - energy cosmic rays have over the last months reported a wealth of new results pointing to the existence of an exotic source of electrons and positrons .",
    "the pamela collaboration reported evidence for a sharp rise of the positron fraction at energies @xmath0 gev  @xcite , possibly extending toward even higher energies , compared to the expectations from spallation of primary cosmic rays on the interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "this result confirmed previous hints about the existence of a positron excess from heat  @xcite , caprice  @xcite and ams-01  @xcite . almost at the same time , the balloon - borne experiments atic  @xcite and ppb - bets  @xcite reported the discovery of a peak in the total electron - plus - positron flux at energies @xmath1 gev , while the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration  @xcite reported a substantial steepening in the high - energy electron - plus - positron spectrum above 600 gev compared to lower energies .",
    "these results raised a lot of interest in the astrophysics and particle physics communities , leading to many proposals trying to explain this excess .",
    "one of the most popular astrophysical interpretations of the positron excess is in terms of the electron - positron pairs produced by the interactions of high - energy photons in the strong magnetic field of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation requires a rather large fraction of the spin - down power being injected in the form of electron - positron pairs or a rather large rate of gamma - ray pulsar formation .",
    "alternatively , the positrons could be originating from the decay of charged pions , which are in turn produced by the hadronic interactions of high - energy protons accelerated by nearby sources  @xcite .",
    "an arguably more exciting explanation of the cosmic - ray positron excess is the possibility that the positrons are produced in the annihilation or the decay of dark matter particles .",
    "should this interpretation be confirmed by future experiments , then the positron excess would constitute the first non - gravitational evidence for the existence of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "the interpretation of the pamela excess in terms of dark matter is subject to constraints from the flux measurements of other cosmic - ray species .",
    "a very important constraint arises from the measurements of the antiproton flux by pamela  @xcite , bess95  @xcite , bess95/97  @xcite , caprice94  @xcite , caprice98  @xcite and imax  @xcite , which are consistent with the expectations from conventional propagation models , thus excluding the possibility of a large antiproton flux from dark matter annihilation or decay  @xcite .",
    "the steep rise in the positron fraction observed by pamela can be explained by dark matter annihilations in the center of the milky way , provided the dark matter particle has a mass larger than @xmath2 gev and annihilates preferentially into leptons of the first or second generation  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation of the positron excess , however , typically requires the _ ad hoc _ introduction of large boost factors .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that if dark matter annihilations are the origin of the pamela anomaly , then the predicted gamma - ray emission from the center of the galaxy is in conflict with the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations for typical cuspy halo profiles  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the positron excess is due to the decay of dark matter particles , the dark matter particles must have a mass larger than @xmath3 gev , a lifetime around @xmath4 s , and must decay preferentially into hard leptons of the first or second generation  @xcite . in this case , no boost factors are required and the gamma and radio measurements are consistent with present measurements  @xcite .",
    "some recent works on the indirect detection of decaying dark matter can be found in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the fermi lat collaboration has published measurements of the electron - plus - positron flux from 20 gev to 1 tev of unprecedented accuracy  @xcite , revealing an energy spectrum that roughly follows a power law @xmath5 without any prominent spectral features .",
    "simultaneously , the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration reported a measurement of the cosmic - ray electron - plus - positron spectrum at energies larger than 340 gev , confirming the fermi result of a power - law spectrum with spectral index of @xmath6 , which furthermore steepens at about 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "the measured energy spectrum is harder than expected from conventional diffusive models , although it can be accommodated by an appropriate change of the injection spectrum of primary electrons .",
    "however , when taken together with the steep rise in the positron fraction as seen by pamela up to energies of 100 gev , the fermi lat data suggest the existence of additional galactic sources of high - energy electrons and positrons with energies up to a few tev .",
    "furthermore , it should be borne in mind that the determination of the correct galactic cosmic - ray scenario is still an open problem , and while an electron injection spectrum harder than the conventional could reproduce the fermi data , it fails to account for the ams-01 and heat data below 20 gev and the h.e.s.s .",
    "data above 1 tev  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the constraints that the results of the pamela and fermi collaborations impose on the scenario of decaying dark matter , assuming a galprop conventional model as our galactic cosmic - ray scenario . to this end , we pursue a model - independent approach , calculating the prediction for the positron fraction and the total electron - plus - positron flux for various decay channels of both a fermionic and a bosonic dark matter particle .",
    "we will identify the most promising scenarios in the light of the pamela and fermi data , and we will calculate for those the predictions for the antiproton flux and the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray flux . some related works have recently appeared  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will review the production and propagation in the galaxy of high - energy electrons / positrons , antiprotons and gamma rays from dark matter decay , including a contribution to the total gamma - ray flux from inverse compton radiation . in section 3 we will show the predictions for the positron fraction and the total electron - plus - positron flux for several decaying dark matter scenarios .",
    "for the promising scenarios , we will also show the predictions for the antiproton and the gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "finally , in section 4 we will present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the propagation model for cosmic rays that we need for the calculation of the electron , positron and antiproton fluxes measurable at earth .",
    "furthermore , we discuss our calculation of the flux of gamma rays , which come from inverse compton scattering ( ics ) with the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) as well as directly from the decay process itself .",
    "if dark matter decays at a sufficiently large rate , the decay products ( electrons , positrons , antiprotons and gamma rays ) could be observable as an anomalous contribution to the high - energy cosmic - ray fluxes .",
    "the production rate of particles per unit energy and unit volume at a position @xmath7 with respect to the center of the milky way is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy spectrum of particles produced in the decay and @xmath10 is the density profile of dark matter particles in the milky way halo . for definiteness we will adopt the spherically symmetric navarro - frenk - white halo density profile  @xcite : @xmath11 ^ 2}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , although our results are almost independent of choice of the density profile .      after being produced in the milky way halo ,",
    "the electrons and positrons propagate through the galaxy and its diffusive halo in a rather complicated way before reaching the earth .",
    "the propagation is commonly described by a stationary two - zone diffusion model with cylindrical boundary conditions  @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "the number density of electrons and positrons per unit energy , @xmath14 , satisfies the following transport equation : @xmath15 +    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e } [ b(e,\\vec{r } ) f_{e^\\pm}]+q_{e^\\pm}(e,\\vec{r})\\;.    \\label{transport1}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side of the transport equation is the diffusion term , which accounts for the propagation through the tangled galactic magnetic field .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 is assumed to be constant throughout the diffusion zone and is parametrized by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the rigidity of the particle , which is defined as the momentum in gev per unit charge , @xmath20 .",
    "the second term accounts for energy losses due to ics on starlight or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , synchrotron radiation and ionization .",
    "we parameterize the energy loss rate as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "lastly , @xmath24 is the source term of electrons and positrons , defined in eq .",
    "( [ source - term ] ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for the transport equation , eq.([transport1 ] ) , require the solution @xmath14 to vanish at the boundary of the diffusion zone , which is approximated by a cylinder with half - height @xmath25 and radius @xmath26 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the propagation of electrons and positrons can be described by just three parameters , the normalization @xmath27 and the spectral index @xmath28 of the diffusion coefficient , which are related to the properties of the interstellar medium , and the height of the diffusion zone , @xmath29 . in our numerical analysis",
    "we will adopt for these parameters the values of the med propagation model defined in @xcite , which provide the best fit to the boron - to - carbon ( b / c ) ratio : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "our conclusions , however , are rather insensitive to the choice of propagation parameters , as the different sets of propagation parameters yield rather similar results for cosmic rays from local sources .",
    "this is due to the fact that at higher energies above several @xmath33 energy losses dominate the effects of diffusion , rendering the exact propagation model parameters less relevant .",
    "we illustrate the dependence of the results on the adopted model parameters for a particular example in section 3 .",
    "the solution of the transport equation at the heliospheric boundary , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , can be formally expressed by the convolution @xmath36 the green s function @xmath37 encodes all the information about astrophysics ( such as the details of the halo profile and the propagation of electrons / positrons in the galaxy ) , while the remaining part is model - dependent and is determined by the nature of the dark matter particles .",
    "analytical and numerical expressions for the green s function for the propagation of electrons / positrons can be found in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the interstellar flux of primary electrons / positrons from dark matter decay is given by : @xmath38    in order to compare our results with the pamela results of the positron fraction as well as the fermi results on the total flux of electrons plus positrons it is necessary to know the background fluxes of high - energy electrons and positrons .",
    "the background flux of positrons is constituted by secondary positrons produced in the collision of primary protons and other nuclei with the interstellar medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the background flux of electrons is constituted by a primary component , presumably produced in supernova remnants , as well as a secondary component , produced by spallation of cosmic rays on the interstellar medium and which is much smaller than the primary component .",
    "whereas the spectrum of secondary electrons and positrons is calculable in a given propagation model , the energy spectrum and the normalization of the primary electron flux is unknown and has to be determined by direct measurements .    in this paper we will adopt for the background fluxes of electrons and positrons the ones corresponding to the `` model 0 '' presented by the fermi collaboration in @xcite , which fits well the low - energy data points of the total electron - plus - positron flux and the positron fraction .",
    "the interstellar background fluxes can be parametrized as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in the energy regime between @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "these approximations are better than @xmath43 .    at energies smaller than @xmath44 gev",
    "the electron / positron fluxes at the top of the atmosphere can differ considerably from the interstellar fluxes , due to solar modulation effects . under the force field approximation",
    "@xcite , the fluxes at the top of the atmosphere are related to the interstellar fluxes by the following simple relation  @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the electron / positron energies at the heliospheric boundary and at the top of the earth s atmosphere , respectively , and @xmath49 being the solar modulation parameter , which varies between 500 mv and 1.3 gv over the eleven - year solar cycle .",
    "in order to compare our predictions with the ams-01 and heat data we will take @xmath50 mv  @xcite .",
    "then , if there exists an exotic source of electrons and positrons from dark matter decay , the total flux of electrons plus positrons and the positron fraction at the top of the atmosphere read , respectively , @xmath51 where we have left the normalization of the primary electron flux as a free parameter , @xmath52 , to be determined in order to provide a qualitatively good fit to the pamela and fermi measurements",
    ".      antiproton propagation in the galaxy can be described in a similar manner as that of electrons and positrons . however , since antiprotons are much heavier than electrons and positrons , energy losses are negligible . however , antiproton propagation is affected by convection , which accounts for the drift of antiprotons away from the disk induced by the milky way s galactic wind . following",
    "@xcite we will assume that it has axial direction and that it is constant inside the diffusion region : @xmath53 .",
    "then , the transport equation for antiprotons reads : @xmath54 + q_{\\bar p}(t,\\vec{r})\\ ; ,    \\label{transport2}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the antiproton kinetic energy .",
    "as for the case of electrons and positrons , the solution of the transport equation at the heliospheric boundary , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , can be formally expressed by the convolution @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the proton mass .",
    "analytical and numerical expressions for the green s function @xmath59 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the interstellar flux of primary antiprotons from dark matter decay is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the velocity of the antiprotons .",
    "the prediction of the antiproton flux from dark matter decay is very sensitive to the choice of propagation parameters .",
    "therefore , we will show the results for three different propagation models that are consistent with the observed b / c ratio and that give the maximal ( max ) , median ( med ) and minimal ( min ) antiproton flux  @xcite .",

    "in some well - motivated dark matter scenarios , the dark matter particles are unstable and decay with a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe . in this paper",
    "we have investigated whether the anomalies in the positron fraction and the total electron - plus - positron flux reported by the pamela and the fermi lat collaborations , respectively , could be interpreted as a signature of the decay of dark matter particles .",
