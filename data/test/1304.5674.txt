    "cable theory , initially developed by rall @xcite , is one of the most significant contributions of theoretical neuroscience and has been extremely useful to explain a large range of phenomena ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "however , cable theory makes a number of assumptions , one of which is that the extracellular space around neurons can be modeled by a resistance , or in other words , that the medium around neurons is resistive or ohmic .",
    "while some measurements seem to confirm this assumption  @xcite , other measurements revealed a marked frequency dependence of the extracellular resistivity  @xcite , which indicates that the medium is non - resistive .",
    "indirect measurements of the extracellular impedance also show evidence for deviations from resistivity  @xcite , which could be explained by the influence of ionic diffusion  @xcite . despite such evidence for non - resistive media ,",
    "the possible impact on cable properties has not been evaluated .",
    "the effect of non - resistive media can be investigated by integrating this effect in the impedance of the extracellular medium , @xmath0 , and in particular , through its frequency dependence .",
    "for example , it can be shown that @xmath1 for capacitive effects or electric polarization  @xcite , @xmath2 for ionic diffusion ( also called the `` warburg impedance ''  @xcite ) , while @xmath0 would be constant for a perfectly resistive medium .",
    "to integrate such effects in a given formalism , such as the genesis of extracellular potentials , our approach has been to integrate a general frequency - dependent function @xmath3 in the formalism , and then consider specific cases  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we follow this approach and generalize cable equations for media with arbitrarily complex frequency - dependent impedance . with numerical simulations , we consider specific cases such as resistive media , ionic diffusion , capacitive media , etc .",
    "we evaluate a number of possible consequences on the variation of the membrane potential along the cable , and how such effects could be measured experimentally .",
    "all simulations were done using matlab . to simulate the cable structure of the models ,",
    "a classic compartmental model strategy was used for simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]f ) , but was different from the one used in common simulator programs such as neuron ( hines and carnevale , @xcite ) .",
    "each cylindric compartment is connected to intracellular and extracellular resistances or impedances , and these are normally used to solve the cable equations . in the present paper",
    ", we used another , equivalent method which consists of defining an _ auxiliary impedance _ , given by where and are respectively the transmembrane potential and the axial current per unit length at the point where is connected ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this auxiliary impedance allows to take into account the influence of other compartments , including the soma , over the axial current and transmembrane potential .",
    "it is mathematically equivalent to consider the continuity conditions on axial current and transmembrane potential .",
    "the electric and geometric parameters are considered constant in each compartment , but are allowed to vary between compartments . in these conditions , and are solution of partial differential equations ( cable equations ) and thus depend on spatial coordinates .",
    "the cable equations simulated in this article are generalized to allow one to include media with complex electrical properties .",
    "we have designed a matlab code that simulates such generalized cable structures , using different types of linear density of complex impedances ( ) and specific impedances ( ) in each compartment .",
    "see results for details of this method .",
    "all computations were made in fourier space .",
    "we have applied the theory to four different types of media to evidence their effect on the spatial and frequency profile of the membrane potential .",
    "these models are called sc , fc , fo and nic , respectively ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the sc model is the `` standard model '' as defined by tuckwell @xcite ; the fc model corresponds to a model similar to the standard model ( based on a closed circuit ) , but the cytoplasm and extracellular media impedances can be frequency - dependent .",
    "the fo type model is the same , with an open circuit ( no return current ) .",
    "the nic model includes a non - ideal capacitance similar to a previous study @xcite .",
    "see results for details of these models .",
    "all numerical simulations were made using a `` continuous ball - and - stick '' model , consisting of a single cylindric compartment , described as a continuum ( see results ) , and a spherical soma .",
    "the dendritic compartment has a radius of and a membrane time constant of , which corresponds to typical values of conditions .",
    "the has a radius of and the specific capacitance was of .",
    "these parameters represent typical values used in a number of previous studies @xcite .",
    ".summary of dendritic cable types and parameters .",
    "the table gives the parameters , and for different model types .",
    "the standard model ( sc ) is the cable model as given by rall , koch and tuckwell  @xcite .",
    "the `` frequency - dependent model '' ( fc ) correspond to a standard cable ( closed circuit ) , but where the parameters and are allowed to be frequency dependent . in the `` frequency - dependent open - circuit model '' ( fo ) , the current in the extracellular medium is `` perpendicular '' to the membrane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the frequency and spatial profiles of the @xmath4 for such fully diffusive models .",
    "taking the fo model with low extracellular impedance ( at ) leads to large differences with the fc model ( fig .",

    "we can see that , in fc type models , the larger , the steeper the transfer function attenuates with distance .",

    "this paradoxical result can be explained as follows : in fc models , plays as similar role as , such that for large values of their real part , thermal diffusion attenuates the signal ; in fo models , plays a similar role as , and large values of limit the leak membrane current , reducing the attenuation with distance .",
    "thus , for large , the dendrites become more `` democratic '' in the sense that the effect of a given input will be less dependent on its position on the dendrite .",

    "this type of resonance was studied further in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where one can see that a resonance in also implies a resonance in : the still attenuates with distance independently of the frequency , so that we always have .",
    "in addition , eq .  [ eq23 ] shows that , so that the quantity increases when increases with frequency , which implies that becomes more negative because this derivative is always negative .",
    "it follows that attenuates more steeply with distance when increases with frequency . using a similar reasoning",
    ", one can show that attenuates less steeply with distance when diminishes with frequency .",
    "we conclude that the rate of variation of with frequency is always opposed to that of .",
    "consequently , the resonance frequency must be the same for and because we have when and when .",
    "we also see that the peak frequency of the resonance continuously depends on the membrane time constant ( not shown ) . for example , for , the resonance is at about , and for , the resonance is at about ( for more details see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that we have observed resonances only in fc type models with resistive extracellular media and diffusive cytoplasm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , but resonances are present in the two types of models ( fo and fc ) when they are fully diffusive .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a generalization of cable equations to membranes within media with complex or heterogeneous electrical properties .",
    "we have shown that generalized cable equations can treat a number of problems presently not treatable by the traditional cable equations .",
    "we have shown that the nature of the extracellular medium has a significant influence on fundamental neuronal properties , such as attenuation with distance , and the spectral profile of the transmembrane potential .",
    "we enumerate below the consequences and predictions of this work , as well as outline directions for future studies .",
    "to solve this problem , we have introduced the concept of _ generalized current _ , and show that the generalized current is conserved in all situations .",
    "this stands in contrast with the free - charge current , which is conserved only in special cases .",
    "for example , if the medium is electrically non - homogeneous ( with conductive and non - conductive domains ) , there will be charge accumulation and non - conservation of the free - charge current .",
    "thus the traditional cable formalism , which is based on the free - charge current , can not treat this problem . with the generalized current ,",
    "however , this problem can be treated in a physically plausible way , in accordance with maxwell equations .",
    "one drawback of generalized cable equations is that they can not be solved with available neural simulation environments , such as neuron @xcite , which implements the traditional cable formalism .",
    "consequently , we have developed a specific method for the numerical simulation of generalized cables .",
    "this method is implementable with traditional simulation programs , such as matlab .",
    "further work would be needed to determine if generalized cable equations could be included in neural simulators , as a special case .",
    "note that specialized models different from the standard model were introduced relatively recently @xcite to include aspects which can not be treated by the standard model . in @xcite ,",
    "the cytoplasm was considered as non - resistive but capacitive , and was modeled by a rc circuit .",
    "it was estimated that this capacitive aspect is important to understand the nature of thermal noise in thin dendritic branches .",
    "@xcite considers the case of the interaction between closely located dendritic branches . in this case",
    ", the authors study the phenomenon of surface polarization ( see also @xcite ) and evaluate the magnitude of the maxwell - wagner time of the effective impedance of the extracellular medium , needed to have significant influences over the attenuation profile of the v@xmath5 .",
    "these two studies show that the physical nature of the intracellular or extracellular media can have significant influences on cable properties .",
    "however , they do represent very particular cases , which motivated the present study where we have attempted to consider a broad range of cases , including both intracellular and extracellular media , as well as ionic diffusion , which was not treated previously .",
    "thus , the present study generalizes those prior studies .    a second main result of this paper was to also generalize the electrical circuit representing neuronal membranes . instead of considering the neuron as a closed system , where all outward currents return to the neuron",
    ", we have considered the more general case which allows current exchange between neighboring neurons , and thus each is represented by an _",
    "open circuit_. we have systematically compared open - circuit ( fo ) models with the traditional closed - circuit ( fc ) models , and found some important differences .",
    "fo models have a transfer function that depends much less on frequency and space , compared to fc models ( see figs .  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we also showed that a previously introduced model of non - ideal cable  @xcite is equivalent to a traditional cable with appropriately scaled extracellular resistances ( for frequencies smaller than ; see figs .",
    "7 and 8 in @xcite , as well as the discussion in that paper ) .",
    "one of the most important result the nature of extracellular or intracellular media can have a strong impact on cable properties such as attenuation with distance .",
    "we have observed that the nature of the extracellular medium has an opposite impact on distance attenuation on fo and fc models . in fo models ,",
    "larger extracellular impedances lead to less attenuation and electrotonically more compact dendrites .",
    "the attenuation can be remarkably diminished for fully resistive fo models , with only a few percent attenuation ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , whereas for fc type models , the opposite was seen , the dendrites become more compact for low extracellular impedances .",
    "we can say that in these cases , the effect of distal inputs is close to that of proximal inputs , and thus the dendrite is more `` democratic '' . it may be that this remarkable property is present in some types of neurons to reduce the attenuation of distal inputs , which constitutes another interesting direction to explore in future work .",
    "another interesting observation is that diffusive extracellular impedances can give rise to resonance frequencies ( see figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] ) , which also appears as a resonance in ( fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the resonant frequency depends on the membrane time constant , and is in the range of 5 - 40  hz , which is well within the frequency range of brain oscillations such as theta , alpha , beta or gamma rhythms  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that this resonance plays a role in the .",
    "interestingly , we observed that the input impedance of the extracellular medium ( ) must necessarily be negative in the standard model where the medium is resistive . in a closed - circuit configuration , this means that one must necessarily assume a source of energy , such as an electromotive force .",
    "this source of energy can be simulated by a negative impedance .",
    "this important point was pointed in previous work , where it was called `` anomalous impedance '' @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this constraint disappears in the open - circuit configuration . if the current field is open in the extracellular medium , then it is not necessary to assume that is negative , and there is no need of such a source of energy .    in conclusion , we think that the generalized cable equations allow one to treat the problem of how neuronal membranes behave in complex extracellular and heterogeneous media .",
    "given the possible strong impact of such media as found here , future studies should evaluate in more depth whether such media are indeed influential .",
    "a possible approach would be to find `` signatures '' of the extracellular medium from the power spectral density of experimentally observable variables , such as the membrane potential ( for a related approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "the direct measurement of the extracellular impedance , at present bound to contradictory experimental results @xcite , should give a definite indication whether the generalized cable is a necessary approach to accurately model neurons .",
    "[ appgencurr ]",
    "in this appendix , we show explicitly that the displacement current can be used to formally calculate the charge variation in a given domain .",
    "moreover , we show that the displacement current across a closed surface which surrounds a given domain is zero when there is no charge variation inside the domain .    by definition , the density of displacement current ( eq .  [ eq5 ] ) in frequency space is given by : where . by applying the divergence on and taking into account maxwell - gauss law ,",
    "we obtain : thus , we can calculate the amount of free charges in a given domain from the density of displacement current in frequency space . to do this",
    ", we have where is the displacement current flowing across surface . applying the inverse fourier transform , we obtain the rate of free charge variation in domain : therefore , one can say that the charge in the considered volume does not vary the displacement current across surface is zero .",
    "finally , because the differential conservation law for free charges implies : we can then write : when the surface is closed and when the free charge conservation law applies .",
    "thus , the generalized current entering a given closed surface is always equal at every time to the generalized current exiting , _ even if there is free charge accumulation _ inside .",
    "however , this equality does not allow one to deduce if there are variations of free charge density inside , because the displacement current must necessary be zero across to have ( see eq .",
    "[ eqa4 ] ) . in other words , it is necessary that the displacement current entering is equal to the displacement current exiting to have a constant charge inside . note that in any given circuit , kirchhoff s current law always applies to the generalized current , even if there is charge accumulation inside the circuit , whereas it applies to the free charge current _ only assuming there is no charge accumulation inside the circuit_.",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the input impedance of a cable segment of length when this segment is connected to an arbitrary impedance ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .    by definition , we have in :    applying eq .",
    "[ eq25 ] allows us to directly express as a function of the cable parameters .",
    "we have similarly , applying eqs .  [ eq14 ] , [ eq17 ] and [ eq22 ]",
    ", we obtain : this last expression allows us to express the current at coordinate as a function of the cable parameters : where thus , the expression for the input impedance is given by : we can then evaluate the ratio by using the conditions of continuity of the current and of the voltage at point . applying eqs .",
    "[ eq25 ] and [ eq14 ] to that point gives : thus , we have and we can write it follows that the input impedance is given by : where    note that when , and when .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the transfer function using the same conditions and conventions as for appendix  [ appb ] .    applying eq .",
    "[ eqb5]a gives : thus , we have applying eq .",
    "[ eqb7 ] gives the transfer function : where    note that and .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the non - ideal capacitance model introduced previously @xcite is equivalent to an open - circuit resistive model if we assume that the circuits and in fig .",
    "[ figf1 ] are linked by the following transformation : we show that the in the non - ideal cable model corresponds to in an open - circuit ( fo ) type resistive model , with a reference located far - away . according to circuits and in fig .",
    "[ figf1 ] , we have : it follows that the impedances of circuits a and b are equal if we have :    we see that the ratio is a homographic transform of variable . consequently , we have the following relation when the two circuits are equivalent . the only way to guarantee that the equivalence is independent of frequency is to assume that the corresponding coefficient of the transformations are equal . we can thus set , and .",
    "this gives us 3 equations which link the 3 parameters of circuit a to those of circuit b. the solution is the transformation law ( eqs .",
    "[ eqf1 ] ) .",
    "thus , on a physical point of view , one can not distinguish the topology of circuits a and b if we would perform external measurements .",
    "moreover , because the functions , , do not depend on frequency , their equivalence will be also valid for all frequencies .",
    "we can deduce that the two circuits will behave identically as a function of time .",
    "it follows that the ( between points 1 and 2 ) in circuit a ( non - ideal capacitance ) corresponds to the relative to a far - away reference in circuit b ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a model with non - ideal capacitance and zero extracellular resistance should produce a equivalent to the of a model with ideal capacitance and resistive extracellular medium .",
