    "the discrete - time quantum walk ( qw ) , which is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk , has been extensively investigated since ambainis et al .",
    "@xcite studied a detail of the walk .",
    "the continuous - time qw was proposed by farhi and gutmann  @xcite , and has been analyzed on not only regular graphs but also complex networks  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a further development in the theory of the qw during recent 10 years showed us several novel properties on both qws .",
    "the behavior of the qw is quite different from that of the random walk and is expected to be connected with various phenomena in quantum mechanics .",
    "a relation between the qw and quantum computer has been also discussed  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the quantum search algorithm designed by the qw is one of the important applications .",
    "the grover search algorithm can be considered as a discrete - time qw on the complete graph and it produces speed - up at the square - root rate for the corresponding classical search .",
    "there are some reviews of the qw  @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes in the study of the qw is to derive the limit distribution and the asymptotic behavior as time tends to infinity .",
    "the limit distribution has been obtained for various kinds of qws . in the present paper , we concentrate on the qw in the one - dimensional space . observing previous results , one can mention that each limit distribution usually has a compact support and admits a singularity at the boundary of the support .",
    "this is an interesting property of the limit distribution , because the qw does not possess any singularity in space .",
    "to the fact , we now address a question : how to understand the singularity of the qw ? motivated by this question ,",
    "we investigate the limit distribution of the qw from a viewpoint of the differential equation .",
    "we begin with finding a differential equation for the limit distribution .",
    "for example , consider discrete- and continuous - time symmetric simple random walks on the line .",
    "the central limit theorem for the walk , that is , @xmath0 , is well - known , where @xmath1 denotes the walker s position at time @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the probability that the walker is at position @xmath4 at time @xmath2 . for the limit density function @xmath5 ,",
    "an equation @xmath6 is derived .",
    "this equation comes from the theory of the diffusion equation @xmath7 , and in particular , it is also obtained by the _ self - similarity _ of the fundamental solution @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider both discrete - time and continuous - time qws on the line .",
    "the classical random walk corresponds to the diffusion process , while for the qw the corresponding process is not known .",
    "thus , to find out the process would remain as one of important problems .",
    "taking an account of the singularity in the limit distribution , we treat a class of fucksian linear differential equations of the second order . for discrete - time ( resp .",
    "continuous - time ) qws , we are led to a heun s differential equation ( he ) ( resp . a hypergeometric differential equation by gauss ( the gauss equation , ge ) ) .",
    "the ge is one of typical fucksian equations and represents the fucksian equations with exactly three regular singular points . on the other hand ,",
    "the he was proposed in 1888 by heun  @xcite and admits four regular singular points .    moreover , a concept of confluence between the he and the ge helps us to understand a relationship between discrete- and continuous - time qws clearly . through these results ,",
    "authors believe that the he and the ge play an important role in understanding the qws .    to this end",
    ", we will mention a significant remark on the qw and the @xmath9 inozemtsev model , which is an integrable quantum system .",
    "these two models are to be connected through he s .",
    "therefore , we would like to expect a new mathematical theory on the relation between qws , he s , and quantum mechanics .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ dt ] , we explain both the one - dimensional discrete - time qw and the he . after introducing the limit distribution obtained by konno  @xcite",
    ", we discuss a relation between the discrete - time qw and the he . in sect .",
    "[ ct ] , we concentrate on the continuous - time qw , and show that the ge relates with the limit density function of the walk .",
    "section  [ dtct ] is devoted to a connection between the he and the ge in order to understand a relationship between discrete- and continuous - time qws given by strauch  @xcite . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize the relations obtained here and propose a future problem on our results .",
    "furthermore , we transform the he to the @xmath9 inozemtsev system in [ app1 ] and show relations among measure of the qw , the he and the ge in [ app2 ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss a relation between the discrete - time qw in one dimension and the he . at first we define the qw on the line .",
    "let @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) be infinite components vectors which denote the position of the walker . here",
    ", @xmath4-th component of @xmath10 is 1 and the other is 0 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the amplitude of the walker at position @xmath4 at time @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the set of complex numbers .",

    "some limit theorems and asymptotic behaviors have been obtained . in particular , we focus on the density function of probability distribution as @xmath28 .",
    "the limit distribution of the qw was given by konno  @xcite .",
