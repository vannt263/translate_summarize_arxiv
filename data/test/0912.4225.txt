    "compact groups of galaxies are associations of three to seven galaxies , where the projected distances between them is of the order of their diameters , and where the group shows a low velocity dispersion , making compact groups an ideal place to study galaxy interaction and intergalactic star formation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
