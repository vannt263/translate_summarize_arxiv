    "ulxs may be supercritical accretion disks observed close to the disk axis in close binaries with a stellar mass black hole or microquasars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another idea is that ulxs may be intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) with `` normal '' accretion disks ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that ulxs are not homogeneous class of objects .",
    "it was suggested originally by katz @xcite that ss433 being observed close to the jet axis , will be extremely bright x - ray source .",
    "fabrika & mescheryakov @xcite discussed observational properties of face - on ss433-like objects and concluded that they may appear as a new type of extragalactic x - ray sources .",
    "in @xcite we discussed possible properties of the funnel in the supercritical accretion disk of ss433 .",
    "we predicted x - ray spectra and temporal behaviour of the funnel in `` face - on ss433 '' star in application for ulxs .",
    "here we continue to develop this idea and consider nebulae surrounding the ulxs sources .",
    "the main difference between ss433 and other known x - ray binaries is highly supercritical and persistent mass accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) onto the relativistic star ( a probable black hole , @xmath2 ) , which has led to the formation of a supercritical accretion disk and the relativistic jets .",
    "ss433 properties were reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "similar to ss433 the ulxs are connected with nebulae .",
    "they are frequently located in bubble - like nebulae .",
    "new data @xcite show that the nebulae are expanding with a velocity @xmath3 ( up to @xmath4 ) .",
    "the nebula sizes are from 20 to a few hundred parsecs , such nebulae are easy for observations even from `` megaparsec distances '' . here",
    "we compare the gas nebula around ss433 with nebulae of ulxs in holmberg ii , ngc6946 and ic342 galaxies observed recently by the integral - field spectroscopy methods .",

    "the object ss433 is surrounded by the elongated radio nebula w50 , which was produced ( or distorted ) by ss433 jets due to the jet interaction with interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is synchrotron , relativistic electrons appear at the jet deceleration .",
    "bright optical filaments are observed @xcite in places of the jets termination , they radiate in hi , [ oi ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] lines .",
    "optical filaments in the bipolar nebula are located at @xmath6 or @xmath7 from ss433 .",

    "the radial velocity across the nebula has been measured in more details in observations with scorpio .    in all three studied ulxs nebulae diagnostic line ratios indicate collisional excitation of the gas ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we obtain two more conclusions which may be principal for understanding of the ulxs : + 1 .",
    "the radial velocity gradient of @xmath24km / s on spatial scales @xmath25pc testify that the nebulae are dynamically perturbed .",
    "the imbhs can not perturb the interstellar gas on such big scales , the capture bondi radii are not greater than 0.1pc .",
    "these nebulae can not be snrs , they are too big and energetic , they do not satisfy to standard relations for snrs .",
    "it is very probable that the nebulae are powered by stellar wind or jets like that it is in ss433 .",
