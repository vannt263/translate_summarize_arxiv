    "the central observation is that the resistivity becomes strongly anisotropic close to half filling of the topmost landau level . from a theoretical point of view , it is argued to be a signature of a novel coulomb - induced charge - density - wave ground state whose existence had been predicted by fogler _ et al .",

    "the confining potential plays an important rule , since it defines the hamiltonian of the theory .",
    "mainly , we are interested to investigate the laughlin liquid by considering a confining potential that is not of parabolic type .",
    "we develop an appropriate anisotropic model that generalizes the sp approach and investigate the basic features of these qh fluids . making use of a unitary transformation",
    ", we end up with a diagonalized system that allows us to define creation and annihilation matrix operators . calculating the area of the qh droplet of matrix variables ,",
    "we obtain a filling factor @xmath7 , which depends on an anisotropy parameter @xmath8 , thus generalizing the isotropic ( polychronakos ) factor @xmath9 .",
    "we show that @xmath7 can be tuned to describe some special anisotropic filling factors , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "we build up the ground state of our model as well as its excitations in terms of two different representations , those corresponding to variables before and after a suitable transformation .    in section [ sec - cmm ] ,",
