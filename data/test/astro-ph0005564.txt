    "in the far - infrared the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) consists of radiation emitted by galaxies , intergalactic gas and dust , photon  photon interactions ( @xmath3-ray vs. cmb ) and , possibly , by decaying relic particles . a large fraction of the energy released in the universe since the recombination epoch is contained in the cirb .",
    "an important aspect is the balance between the uv - optical and the infrared backgrounds . with recent observations at infrared and sub - mm wavelengths",
    "it has become obvious that star formation efficiencies in the early universe derived from optical and uv observations are underestimated ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "@xcite ; steidel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the data from the cobe dirbe ( hauser et al .",
    "@xcite ) and firas ( fixsen et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicated a fir cirb flux at a surprisingly high level of @xmath11 mjy sr@xmath4 between 100 and 240 @xmath0 m .",
    "similar results had been obtained already by puget et al .",
    "@xcite and schlegel et al .",
    "because of the great importance of the fir cirb for cosmology these results require confirmation by independent measurements .",
    "the final goal of the isophot cirb project is the determination of the fir cirb flux level .",
    "first steps are the measurement of the cirb fluctuations and the detection of the bright end of fir point source population .",
    "the isophot cirb project has potential advantages over the dirbe analysis : ( 1 ) with the much smaller f.o.v .",
    "isophot is capable of looking at the darkest spots between the cirrus clouds ; ( 2 ) in spite of the smaller f.o.v .",
    "isophot s sensitivity surpasses that of dirbe in the important fir window at 120  200 @xmath0 m ; ( 3 ) with the good spatial and spectral sampling the galactic cirrus can be separated .",
    "we have mapped four low - cirrus regions at high galactic latitude at the wavelengths of 90 , 150 , and 180 @xmath0 m . here",
    "we report on the point sources ( galaxies ) found in the fir maps .",
    "the fir source counts are important for the study of the star formation history of the universe and for the testing of models of galaxy evolution .",
    "the point source extraction is based on the fitting of the detector footprint to spatial data .",
    "the method is different from those used in most previous studies ( e.g. kawara et al .",
    "@xcite ; puget et al .",
    "@xcite ) where the source detection has been based on the analysis of the detector signal as a function of time .",
    "our analysis is therefore independent of and complementary to previous results .",
    "the observations were performed with the isophot ( lemke at el .",
    "@xcite ) aboard iso ( kessler et al .",
    "the maps were made in the pht22 staring raster map mode ( see table  [ table : maps ] ) .",
    "the area covered is @xmath11.5 square degrees .",
    "the fields have low surface brightness and in some cases there is some redundancy i.e. the observed pixel rasters partly overlap each other .",
    "the data were processed with pia ( pht interactive analysis ) versions 7.1 and 7.2 .",
    "the flux density calibration was made using the fcs ( fine calibration source ) before and after each map .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute calibration is expected to be better than 30% ( klaas et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "data reduction from the erd ( edited raw data ) to scp ( signal per chopper plateau ) was performed using the pairwise method ( stickel @xcite ) .",
    "instead of making linear fits to the ramps consisting of the detector read - outs one examines the distribution of the differences between consecutive read - outs .",
    "the mode of the distribution is estimated with myriad technique ( kalluri & arce @xcite ) and is used as the final signal for each sky position .",
    "the pairwise method is robust against glitches and the analysis was based on the data reduced with this method .",
    "the source detection was performed in two steps using data processed to the aap ( astrophysical applications data ) level with pia and the pairwise method . the data consists of surface brightness values with error estimates .",
    "flat fielding was performed with custom routines .",
    "each surface brightness value was compared with the mean of the region within a radius of @xmath1three times the size of the detector pixel .",
    "values more than 0.7@xmath5 above the local background were considered as potential point sources . a model consisting of a point source and a constant background",
    "was fitted into each region surrounding a candidate position .",
    "footprint matrices were used to calculate the contribution of the point source to the observed surface brightness values .",
    "the free parameters of the fit were the source flux density , the two coordinates of the source position , and the background surface brightness .",
    "the formal errors are used to calculate the probability , @xmath6 , that the detection is not caused by background noise .",
    "the completeness of the source detection and the number of false detections were studied with simulations .",
    "the results were used to adjust the probability level that was used for discarding uncertain detections .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 between the source flux density and the background rms noise , @xmath8 , was used as a criterion to discard uncertain sources .",
    "since @xmath7 is not directly related to the probability obtained from the footprint fit it can be used as an additional safeguard against false detections .",
    "the actual source list consists of sources detected at two or three wavelengths with a spatial distance between detections of less than 80 .",
    "the expected number of co - incidental associations is no more than @xmath110% and does not significantly affect the source counts .",
    "the surface density of sources is estimated by dividing the number of detected sources at a given flux density level with the corresponding ` effective ' map area .    as the first approximation the effective area corresponding to a given flux density level was taken to be the sum of those maps where sources with equal or lower flux densities were detected .",
    "the cumulative source densities obtained at 90@xmath0 m , 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m are shown as histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : allcounts1 ] . two sets of sources were used .",
    "the first set consists of all detections ( dotted line ) while in the second set there are only sources detected at more than one wavelength ( solid line ) .",
    "the results are similar for 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m and significant differences are seen only at 90@xmath0 m .",
    "this is expected , since sources seen at 150@xmath0 m are likely to be seen also at 180@xmath0 m ( and vice versa ) while more of the 90@xmath0 m sources remain unconfirmed at the longer wavelengths .    a third estimate for the cumulative source densities ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : allcounts1 ] ) was obtained by selecting sources based on the ratio @xmath7 ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : procedure ] ) . for each flux density level sources with @xmath9 were selected and no confirmation at other wavelengths was required .",
    "the effective area was obtained by integrating the total area where the rms noise was below 1/@xmath10 times the source flux density .",
    "the values of @xmath11 were selected based on simulations . at the bright end",
    "the results agree with earlier histograms since no sources are rejected and the corresponding areas converge towards the total area mapped .    at very low flux density levels",
    "the small number of sources leads to large uncertainties .",
    "the values obtained below 150mjy for 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m are probably only indicative .",
    "we have checked the probability that some of the sources detected are small scale cirrus structures ( cirrus knots ) .",
    "results of herbstmeier et al .",
    "@xcite show that at the scale of the c100 beam size , @xmath12 , the expected cirrus fluctuation amplitude is below 10jysr@xmath13 for all our 90@xmath0 m maps .",
    "according to gautier et al .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a flux density of 4mjy which is clearly below the flux densities of the faintest 90@xmath0 m detections .",
    "therefore , cirrus is not likely to be a significant contaminant in the source counts although , because of the non - gaussian nature of the cirrus fluctuations ( gautier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , our source list may still contain a few cirrus knots .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : lisenfeld ] we compare the average of the source spectra with the spectra of the galaxies arp193 and ngc4418 . in the sample of luminous infrared galaxies presented by lisenfeld , isaak & hills",
    "@xcite arp193 has the lowest and ngc4418 the highest estimated dust temperature .    in the rest frame",
    "the seds of luminous infrared galaxies reach maxima between 60@xmath14 m and 100@xmath14 m ( silva et al .",
    "@xcite ; devriendt , guiderdoni & sadat @xcite ; lisenfeld , isaak & hills @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of our fir sources are flat in the observed wavelength range and the emission peak is typically above 90@xmath14 m .",
    "this is consistent with most sources being at redshifts 0.5@xmath15@xmath16@xmath151 .",
    "the fir emission maximum of normal spiral galaxies is also located close to 100@xmath14 m ( e.g. silva et al .",
    "however , in the case of a spiral galaxy a fir detection at the level of 0.1jy would correspond to a visual magnitude brighter than 16 and the optical counterpart should be readily visible .",
    "the lack of clear visual counterparts indicates that most of our sources are likely to be more distant and luminous infrared galaxies .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : allcounts1 ] we obtain lower limits of 9@xmath1710@xmath18sr@xmath4 , 2.0@xmath1710@xmath19sr@xmath4 and 2.2@xmath1710@xmath19sr@xmath4 for the cumulative source counts @xmath20100mjy at 90@xmath0 m , 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m , respectively .",

    "our results are close to their values .",
    "our lowest estimates that were based on detections at two or three wavelengths are , however , lower by more than a factor of two .",
    "this could indicate that the requirement of having detections at more than one wavelength does indeed underestimate the counts .",
    "latest results from the elais survey ( oliver et al .",
