    "the currently most - accepted scheme for the structure of an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the unified model , consists of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , surrounded by an accretion disc and , in the same plane at larger distances , an axisymmetric distribution of gas and dust , usually referred to as a torus . within the inner region of the obscuring torus lies an ensemble of highly ionized and dense gas clouds , where broad emission lines are produced , the broad line region ( blr ) . outside the torus",
    "there is a region of low - ionization less dense gas clouds , the narrow line region ( nlr ) ( e.g. antonucci 1993 , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the dust present in the putative obscuring torus blocks most radiation from the inner photoionizing source at optical , uv and soft x - ray wavelengths , but it is responsible for most of the agn emission at mid - ir frequencies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ) .",
    "the dust in the torus absorbs and re - radiates the emission from the core at these frequencies .",
    "thus , mid - ir observations , for example those probing rest - frame wavelengths around 12@xmath9 m , indirectly reveal radiation from regions close to the active nucleus .",
    "this is supported by observations that show the mid- to far - ir continuum emitted by powerful radio galaxies to be mainly due to agn heating of circumnuclear dust ( e.g. dicken et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "according to the most widely accepted model for the archetype structure of an agn , in the accretion disc , and potentially in regions connected to the event horizon of the black hole itself , magnetized inflowing material enables processes capable of driving two opposed collimated outflows , known as the jets ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these jets push magnetised material out of the central region and feed lobes .",
    "the acceleration of ultrarelativistic charged particles produces synchrotron radiation , visible mainly at radio frequencies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the radio luminosity due to jets is inherently related to the central engine that powers the agn .",
    "one of the most prominent features in the optical spectrum of an agn is the [ oii ] emission line .",
    "it is produced in a very low density ionized medium , such as the nlr , when thermal photoelectrons collide with oxygen atoms and excite their lower energy levels .",
    "even though de - excitation through downward radiation has a very low probability , in such a low density medium , collisions are much more sparse , so the downward radiation results in the emission of this forbidden - line .",
    "since the blr can be obscured by the dusty torus , depending on the galaxy s orientation , and the nlr is always visible , [ oii ] is a good tracer of the underlying continuum emission in an agn ( e.g. @xcite ) , although other narrow lines , e.g. [ oiii ] , may be better @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that there is a correlation between the luminosity of the nlr and the radio luminosity for radio - loud objects and that this relation is independent of redshift ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the idea that the physical process behind radio jets is intrinsically linked to the source of the narrow lines via a common central engine ( an accreting smbh ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore these ideas further by showing how rest - frame @xmath10 luminosity , @xmath2 , as a probe of warm dust emission , correlates with @xmath0 , a tracer of jet power , and with @xmath3}$ ] , which we assume tracks the underlying continuum emission of the agn .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the following values for the cosmological parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we use the convention @xmath14 .",
    "we select all of the narrow - line radio galaxies from the complete low - frequency selected radio samples 3crr @xcite , 6ce @xcite , 6c * ( @xcitea , b ) , 7crs @xcite , and toot00 @xcite surveys by requiring a narrow redshift span of @xmath5 .",
    "the low selection frequency of these samples ( either 178 or 151  mhz ) ensures that they are selected based on their optically thin lobe emission and thus in an orientation independent way .",
    "the narrow - line selection ensures that we are not including blazars or type - i agn , although 3c343 has since been classified as a qso ( cleary et al .",

    ", such a narrow width in redshift allows us to study correlations independent of possible evolutionary effects and any issues with assumed k - corrections . in the local universe",
    "there is not enough cosmic volume to gather a reasonable number of luminous sources , whereas at high redshifts there are no statistically complete samples for the low flux limits that distant luminous sources require to be observed , therefore @xmath16 was chosen as a reasonable compromise . the span of our sample in the redshift ",

    "a previous study conducted by dicken et al ( 2009 ) , using a different sample of powerful radio sources ( @xmath41 ) , also showed a tight correlation exists between the [ oiii ] luminosity and mid- to far - infrared ( 24@xmath9 m and 70@xmath9 m ) luminosities , with the same slope value of approximately 0.71 .",
    "the authors propose that since [ oiii ] luminositiy is a good indicator of the intrinsic agn power ( e.g. @xcite ) , these correlations indicate that mid- to far - infrared luminosities must also be linked to the power of the active core .",
    "following a similar argument , our correlation between [ oii ] and 12@xmath9 m luminosities is consistent with a view in which the central agn is the source of radiation that excites both the nlr , ionizing its gas clouds , and the circumnuclear dust of the inner torus area , where it gets absorbed and re - emitted .",
    "although this correlation could naively be expected to lie closer to a proportionality , some factors are expected to cause some differences in the way 12@xmath9 m and [ oii ] emission trace the central emission .",
    "for instance , while emission at 12@xmath9 m is powered by optical - uv radiation from the accretion disc , the [ oii ] emission line is excited by ionizing radiation from the disc , and therefore variations of the ionization parameter with luminosity might induce a trend in the relationship .",
    "in addition , the 12@xmath9 m emission is radiated from a region closer to the nucleus and thus it might not be as isotropic as [ oii ] emission ( see e.g. @xcite ) . also , in light of the receding torus model , the proportion between mid - ir and [ oii ] luminosities might vary with luminosity ( as previously suggested by dicken et al .",
    "that is , in more powerful agn , the maximum radius at which dust sublimates is further away from the central engine , enlarging the opening angle of the ionizing cone and thus increasing the [ oii ] emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the spearman correlation coefficient is @xmath43 with a spearman rank correlation probability of 98.8% .",

    "we show that the correlation for radio - loud agn is still significant and it is therefore not due to an underlying correlation between redshift and luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : l151_l12 ] shows that there are two ` gaps ' of objects in our sample : objects with high @xmath0 and low @xmath7 , and objects with high @xmath2 and low @xmath0 , respectively represented as regions `` a '' and `` b '' on the plot .",
    "we believe that region a is not an artifact of selection but a real gap .",
    "the justification for this lies on the following points : ( 1 ) the luminosity function of galaxies at all wavelengths shows that fainter objects always outnumber brighter objects and therefore we can always expect to observe more fainter objects for a given wavelength range .",
    "( 2 ) spitzer mips 24@xmath9 m is sensitive enough to detect objects in that range of rest - frame 12@xmath9 m luminosities but finds only objects much brighter than the 24@xmath9 m flux limit .",
    "( 3 ) 3crr , for instance , is a full sky survey and therefore the lack of objects with lower values of @xmath8 is not due to insufficient area surveyed . (",
    "4 ) similarly , it can not be due to cosmic volume , as the volume surveyed is enough to detect bright objects at rest - frame 12@xmath9 m .",
    "we note that bl lac objects could effectively populate region a , however the relativistic beaming thought to occur in bl lacs means that their inferred radio luminosity is not a fair indicator of the total radio emission of the object and upon accounting for this the flux would lie to the left of region a.    the situation with region b is fundamentally different .",
    "our sample is radio selected as opposed to infrared selected so we expect objects with fainter 12@xmath9 m luminosities to outnumber those with high @xmath7 ( see point ( 1 ) above ) .",
    "the surveys deeper than 3crr cover decreasingly smaller sky areas as their flux density limit decreases , thus reducing the likelihood of detecting objects with high @xmath2 ( see points ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) above ) .",
    "for these reasons , the gap b of objects could be the result of selection effects .",
    "it is therefore useful to include objects that lie outside the regime of high-@xmath46-selected samples , as well as objects known to be brighter in ir . for this purpose",

    "some of the objects were not detected with the first survey at a @xmath49 level and these are represented as limits . to determine where",
    "approximately these non - detections lie , we have used a stacking analysis ( yielding statistical detections ) to determine that they do not lie more than about an order of magnitude away from the first flux density limit .",
    "we stacked together the radio images from first of all the non - detections at their known position and obtained a detection at a @xmath50 level .",
    "the blue filled star represents the average luminosities of the stack of all the quasars with limits .",
    "radio luminosity traces the jet power and , in particular for friis , willott et al ( 1999 ) has shown that the jet power , @xmath51 , scales with @xmath0 through the relation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents several uncertainties associated with estimating @xmath51 from @xmath54 .",
    "we chose @xmath55 as this is the expectation value of a flat prior in natural space .",
    "at the same time , the re - radiated mid - ir emission , probes the radiation emitted by the accretion disc and hence the bolometric luminosity @xmath56 .",
    "in turn , @xmath56 is directly linked to the accretion rate , @xmath57 , by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion process .",
    "therefore , a significant correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath2 over a wide range of radio luminosities indicates that there is physical relationship between jet power and accretion rate @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "if we assume the radiative efficiency to be approximately constant , with a value of @xmath61 ( consistent with theoretical simulations , such as @xcite , and observational constrains , for example @xcite ) , then the bolometric luminosity is proportional to the accretion rate , @xmath62 .",
    "the fact that there is a genuine gap ( gap a ) of objects with high @xmath0 and low @xmath2 reveals that to achieve a given jet power , there is a minimum necessary accretion rate .",
    "if the jet power can be parameterised as a function of accretion rate by @xmath63 , with a jet efficiency term @xmath64 , then , for these powerful radio galaxies , a minimum accretion rate implies a maximum jet efficiency .    to quantify how much this maximum efficiency would be",
    ", we can use @xmath65 from above and apply it to the galaxies that form the lower envelope of the data points just above gap a. this yields @xmath66 , which , with the canonical value of @xmath61 , gives @xmath67 ( see red dashed - line in figure[fig : l151_l12 ] ) , a rather high jet efficiency . on the same line ,",
    "@xcite , have found that for some sources @xmath68 , and thus @xmath69 .",
    "the value found is dependent on the uncertaintes of estimating @xmath51 from @xmath70 and @xmath56 using bolometric corrections .",
    "therefore , parameters like @xmath71 can significantly alter the value of @xmath64 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath72 to @xmath73 , the maximim jet efficiency can span the interval @xmath74 .",
    "@xcite also finds that friis can exist in a state with a high time - averaged ratio of @xmath75 or even higher , and finds theoretical solutions with a maximum time averaged ratio of @xmath76 . as discussed in punsly ( 2007 ) , the value of maximum jet efficiency , or , equivalently , @xmath77 , has important theoretical repercussions in terms of whether the jets of friis are powered by the accretion disk or the black hole itself .",
    "there is some discussion as to what is the most appropriate value for @xmath71 .",
    "cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) use chandra x - ray observations to compute the energy stored in x - ray cavities and estimate the jet power .",
    "they then use radio data to investigate the scaling between jet power and radio luminosity , and find a relation that has the same slope as that of willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but where an @xmath72 gives a relation that is two orders of magnitude below their normalisation .",
    "an @xmath78 seems thus more in agreement with these studies .",
    "similarly martnez - sansigre & rawlings ( 2010 ) find that a minimum of @xmath73 is required to fit the local radio luminosity function of galaxies . on the other hand , some studies ( e.g. croston et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) suggest that the value of @xmath71 should be high for fris and low for friis , @xmath79 10 - 20 , and low for friis , @xmath79 1 - 2 .",
    "the regime at which not all radio galaxies are powerful accretors occurs at a lower radio luminosity ( @xmath80 ) , as can be seen in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath2 is a proxy for bolometric luminosity and hence accretion rate , and @xmath0 traces the jet power produced by the smbh , the very large scatter observed in the right panel of figure  [ fig : l151_l12 ] indicates that galaxies with similar accretion rates can produce powerful or weaker jets .",
    "therefore the scatter is probably due to a continuous range of efficiencies with which agn produce jets .",
    "the factors that rule this efficiency are still unclear , but black hole spin might be a dominant mechanism ( e.g. see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "spin is indeed an appealing mechanism for it allows nominal efficiencies @xmath81 , since some of the jet power originates from rotation of the black hole , rather than from the accreted mass ( @xcite , @xcite ) . ]",
    "( e.g. ) .",
    "the fact that [ oii ] line emission luminosity is positively correlated with @xmath82 rest - frame luminosity implies that both quantities trace accretion rate . as @xmath3}$ ] is directly linked to the radiative photoionizing power , which is itself a fraction of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath56 , @xmath3}$ ] is therefore also a tracer of accretion rate .",
    "the relation between @xmath3}$ ] and @xmath0 has similar implications as the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact we expect that with the inclusion of weaker radio sources , the relation between @xmath83 and @xmath3}$ ] would become less tight and probably convert into an envelope , in a similar way to what happens with the radio - loud objects for the @xmath84-@xmath2 relation . some studies of weaker radio sources ( e.g. best et al .",
    "2005b ; shabala et al .",
    "2008 ) indeed suggest that there is a trend for radio - quiet sources to scatter beyond the tight correlation observed for our sample of radio loud sources .",
    "this could also be related to a different accretion mechanism for the lower power radio sources ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "some attention should be drawn to the fact that radio luminosity is not a perfect tracer of the kinetic jet power as it also depends on environmental effects irrespective of the jet power .",
    "for instance , the characteristics of the jet environment may play a significant role in how efficiently the jet power gets converted into radio luminosity . especially in the richer environments inhabited by the strongest radio sources ,",
    "a dense environment might be responsible for boosted radio luminosities at a given jet power ( e.g. barthel @xmath34 arnaud 1996 , falder et al 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , the low frequency radio emission is radiated over scales that are orders of magnitude larger in extent than the torus and hence slower to react to any changes in the central emission than the circumnuclear dust or the nlr .",
    "another caveat is that superimposed on the spectrum at 10@xmath9 m there is a silicate feature due to the si - o streching mode of amorphous silicate grains of dust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this broad feature is generally present in absorption in radio galaxies and in emission in quasars , and the tail of the feature can affect the continuum at 12  @xmath9 m .",
    "in addition , due to the effects of dust extinction , for the same @xmath85 quasars can have up to twice as high values of @xmath86 than radio galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these two effects could moderately bias the inferred values of @xmath56 by introducing a higher offset in @xmath2 for quasars in relation to radio galaxies .",
    "this implies that if the radio galaxies have high extinctions , their luminosity at @xmath87 is underestimated , and therefore @xmath56 is in fact higher .",
    "this would in turn bring the radio galaxies closer to the quasars , reducing the scatter of the data points on the right panel of figure  [ fig : l151_l12 ] .",
    "@xcite quantify how much extinction and the silicate feature can cause the luminosity of quasars and radio galaxies to deviate from each other for wavelengths up to @xmath88 .",
    "they show that at these wavelengths radio galaxies can be on average 4 times less luminous than quasars due to extinction . therefore , if the radio loud galaxies in the sample suffer high extinction ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath56 for the whole bottom envelope would shift upwards , resulting in jet efficiency values of @xmath90 with @xmath55 .",
    "further work on this issue will be presented in fernandes et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "one other matter of caution is the possibility of nonthermal contamination of the mid - ir emission due to synchrotron emission from the radio lobes or a core / jet component . even though this is not a major concern for our sample",
    "as nearly all sources are friis and the non - thermal contamination is in general a negligible fraction of the emitted flux density at mid - ir frequencies , when doppler - boosted or in the case of steep - spectrum lobes lying within the spitzer beam , synchrotron emission from contaminant components can represent a small fraction of the thermal emission ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , given the brightness and radio spectral indices of the sources in our sample this is a minimal effect .",
    "it is an open question whether there is also a radio quiet envelope and a real gap of objects beyond this region ( to the left of region b in the plot ) .",
    "this is difficult to infer as the contribution from stars begins to contaminate the radio emission at such low radio luminosities .",
    "for instance , a typical powerful starburst with a star formation rate of massive stars ( @xmath91 ) of @xmath92 , equivalent to a total star formation rate of @xmath93 assuming a salpeter initial mass function , is capable of producing radio luminosity densities of the order of @xmath94 ( vertical dotted line in figure  [ fig : l151_l12 ] ) . moreover , the most powerful starbursts observed , with a star formation rate of massive stars of the order of @xmath95 equivalent to a total star formation rate of @xmath96 , produce star - related radio luminosity densities of @xmath97 , of the same order as luminosities produced by weaker radio galaxies ( vertical dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : l151_l12 ] ) .",
    "deep high - resolution multi - frequency radio observations are required to cleanly distinguish agn from purely star - forming galaxies .",

    "a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath6}$ ] confirms the previously known relation for larger samples , supporting the idea that a link exists between the origin of the radio jets and the source of the narrow lines .    -",
    "a positive correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath6}$ ] suggests that there is a common emission source that excites the gas clouds in the nlr and the circumnuclear dust .",
    "this is consistent with accretion onto the central black hole being responsible for both forms of excitation .",
    "- a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath98 indicates that radio loud agn have a high mid - ir emission .",
    "mid - ir emission in agns have a thermal component due to dust that absorbs radiation from the accretion disc and re - radiates it at these wavelengths . assuming that the non - thermal contamination is not relevant in our sample ( see discussion in section 4.4 ) , this correlation translates into a relationship between jet power and accretion rate , which implies a common mechanism linking these two physical properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , by adding a sample of bright optically selected quasars we populated the @xmath2 vs @xmath0 plot and found that the objects span a diagonal region parallel to the correlation found for the rgs .",
    "thus , although the strength and slope of the correlation seen in radio - selected samples is affected by selection effects , there is a real gap of objects with bright @xmath99 and low @xmath2 , which shows that for a given jet power there is a minimum accretion rate .",
    "this implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accreted energy can be converted into jet power , and that this efficiency is of order unity .",
