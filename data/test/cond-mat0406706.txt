    "the anomaly in electrical resistivity suggests that it is close to metal - insulator transition .",

    "hall effect measurements indicate that with the increase in magnetic order , the effective carrier concentration increases significantly.@xcite angle - resolved photoemission and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments reveal that eub@xmath0 is a semiconductor with a gap of 0.8 ev .",

    "first principle band structure calculations based on local density approximation ( lda ) yield semimetal with small overlap between the valence and conduction band at the x point of brillouin zone.@xcite again these results are within the limitations of density functional theory ( dft ) .",

    "4 , it is obvious that the largest peak in eub@xmath0 will occur at 7 ev and it will be due to transition from the boron 2@xmath5 main peak in valence band to the eu 5@xmath2 main peak .",

    "the first peak at 0.2 ev for ybb@xmath0 and that at 0.3 ev for eub@xmath0 , are surely due to the plasmon of the conduction electrons .",
    "the first peak is found at 1.8 ev in lab@xmath0 .",
    "this reduction in the energy position is due to the fall in the carrier concentration in divalent hexaborides .",
    "magneto - optical kerr effect is a very complex phenomenon . here",
    "a very subtle interplay between spin - orbit coupling and spin polarization leads to mo signals .",
    "however , in most cases , as in semimetallic magnetic rare - earth compounds , giant signals are obtained due to the plasmon resonance .",
    "the most important prescription for obtaining large mo response is a large plasmon resonance followed by a strong interband transition .",
    "inspite of large so interaction and a fair plasma resonance , we fail to see any kind of mo response in ybb@xmath0 shown in the left panel of figure 8 , as expected for non - magnetic materials .",

    "this proves that magnetism plays a very crucial role in moke .",
    "eub@xmath0 , with a total moment of 7 @xmath38 , is totally spin polarized .",
    "the calculated spectrum , as given in figure 8 , shows a jump from @xmath44 to @xmath45 at 0.3 ev and followed by a small signal of about @xmath46 at 1.5 ev .",
    "the former is due to large plasma resonance and the latter is due to 4@xmath1 to so split 5@xmath2 band transition .",
    "on comparison with the experimental spectrum , the first signal finds agreement . the second one is slightly suppressed and occurs at 0.5 ev higher in energy .",
    "this degree of agreement implies that the drude correction plays a very important role .",
    "obviously this strengthens the fact that eub@xmath0 is semimetallic .",
    "moreover , magnetism plays a crucial role along with so coupling .",
    "magneto - optical@xcite response in undoped eu hexaboride has been found to be giant at high fields and low temperature .",
    "it has been pointed out by broderick et .",
    "that drude component is essential in reproducing the overall features of the experimental kerr rotation spectrum .",
    "the resonance at 0.3 ev is caused by the response of the itinerant charge carriers to magnetism while the kerr response at 1 ev is associated with the magneto - optical response of the 4@xmath1 - 5@xmath2 interband transitions .",
    "on doping eub@xmath0 with isoelectronic ca , the sharp onset of plasma edge is broadened and the related kerr resonance is wiped out .",
    "this can be due to the large damping of the itinerant charge carriers , which is in turn is due to disorder in the cation sublattice.@xcite the intensity of the structure at 1 ev also diminishes with ca doping since the contribution of the 4@xmath1 electrons of eu decreases .",
    "these experimental observations are , hence , consistent with the electronic structure calculation of eub@xmath0 , presented here .",
    "self - consistent spin - polarized band structure calculations are presented for lab@xmath0 , eub@xmath0 and ybb@xmath0 .",
    "they reveal the metallic nature of the first and the low carrier density nature of the divalent ones .",
    "small overlap at the x - point implies semimetallic nature of eub@xmath0 and ybb@xmath0 .",
    "this is in disagreement with the recent arpes measurements in eub@xmath0 .",
    "present calculations lead to reasonable agreement with optical conductivity , reflectivity and magneto - optical kerr spectrum .",
    "the successful reproduction of the moke spectrum in eub@xmath0 implies that magnetism , spin - orbit coupling and large plasma resonance are responsible for the large magneto - optical response in this system .",
    "the mo response at about 1.5 ev is due to 4@xmath1 to 5@xmath2 transition .",
    "the inclusion of strong on - site coulomb repulsion is absolutely essential for its reproduction .",
    "most importantly , drude - like nature at low energy is a very strong evidence for the semi - metallic nature of eub@xmath0 and this is strongly supported by the present calculations ."
