    "on the basis of strong threshold effects of detectors , klebesadel , fenimore , and laros ( 1982 ) concluded that grb fluence tests were largely inconclusive . as a result ,",
    "nearly all subsequent number - brightness tests have used peak flux ( @xmath8 ) rather than fluence ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , the standard candle peak luminosity assumption that is required by  studies is unphysical .",
    "if , for instance , bursts originate at cosmological distances and are produced by colliding neutron stars@xcite then one might expect that total energy would be standard and not peak luminosity .",
    "moreover , recent analysis of the time histories in relativistically expanding shell models has found the required differences in bulk @xmath9 factor between different grbs all but eliminates the possibility of a standard candle luminosity in such models@xcite .    in this paper , we seek to eliminate the large threshold effects present in  studies by correcting the observed number of bursts at a given fluence by the trigger efficiency of the detector . in ",
    "i we use the calculated trigger efficiency in pvo@xcite and the catalogue of pvo events@xcite to test the correction algorithm . in ",
    "ii we examine the fitting algorithm to the curve in batse 3b and find a standard candle energy for cosmological gamma - ray bursts . in ",
    "iii we discuss the implications of such an energy and the distances implied by the fit .",
    "the pioneer venus orbiter ( pvo ) had a peak flux trigger system ( sampled on 0.25 , 1.0 , and 4.0 sec timescales ) and was sensitive to bursts down to fluxes of @xmath10 erg @xmath11 . despite a substantially lower fluence trigger sensitivity range",
    ", pvo saw hundreds more bright bursts than batse due the relatively long on - time and large sky - coverage of pvo .",
    "as the bright region of the batse  curve seems to fit a -3/2 power law well , we would expect that the entire  curve of pvo should show a similar behavior .    using the pvo trigger efficiency , @xmath12 , from in t zand & fenimore ( 1996 ) , for each burst @xmath13 with fluence @xmath14 in the pvo catalogue",
    "we take the expected number of bursts with pre - detection fluence to be @xmath15 .",
    "we then compare the derived log @xmath16-log @xmath6 curve with a -3/2 power law with arbitrary @xmath6-intercept as seen in figure  ( 1b ) .",
    "although at lower fluence there appears to be a deviation from -3/2 , the fit is good : with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) probability of 40% that the corrected distribution comes from a -3/2 power law .",
    "we derive this ks statistic by finding the maximum distance between the corrected and -3/2 distributions ( in linear space ) down to @xmath17 erg @xmath11 , the fluence at which @xmath12 falls to 50% . by comparing the distributions down to lower fluences",
    ", we find an even better ks fit .",
    "this is understandable because as we add more bursts to the distribution , small deviations at high fluences contribute less to the ks distance parameter .",
    "note that although the fit is acceptable , a -3/2 slope is not necessarily required by the corrected data .",
    "we thus conclude that the trigger efficiency determination algorithm from in t zand and fenimore ( 1996 ) is sound , at least in pvo .",
    "one subtly worth noting is that batse trigger efficiencies are model dependent , ie .",
    "they depend on the choice of @xmath20 and cosmology , since it is necessary to know _ a priori _ the true underlying distribution of bursts that passes by the detector .    *",
    "fig .  1 * the log @xmath5-log @xmath6 curve for pvo .",
    "a@xmath21 the uncorrected curve for 293 events in the pvo catalogue which shows significant departure ( ks @xmath22 ) from the -3/2 power law ( shown as solid line ) expected from batse observations .",
    "b@xmath21 the corrected curve ( ks = 0.40 at @xmath23 ) using the pvo trigger efficiency from in t zand & fenimore ( 1996 ) .",
    "any deviation from a -3/2 power - law at low fluences we attribute to an incomplete understanding of the trigger efficiency .",
    "in fact , the derivation of the pvo @xmath12 assumed an underlying -3/2 distribution .",
    "petrosian and lee ( 1996 ) have constructed trigger efficiencies using bivariate correlation . while this method does not assume a particular cosmology",
    ", it does require that grb brightness and duration are inherently uncoupled .",
    "our method does not have this requirement and we make no assumptions about the bursts other then they are cosmological in origin .",
    "the batse trigger efficiencies could be calculated for any @xmath20 ( @xmath24 , @xmath3 ) and two are depicted in figure ( 2a ) .",
    "note that the efficiency is nearly unity for the several orders of magnitude in fluence .",
    "the corrected curve for batse is depicted in figure ( 2b ) for two values of @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , the two distributions are nearly identical for most of the fluence range .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the bend from -3/2 in  is true .",
    "the observed fluence of a source depends strongly on the spectrum , and since the observed spectral shape depends on the distance to the object , the intrinsic spectrum of a grb object must be used .",
    "in addition , the normalization and the spectral shape vary over the duration of the burst , adding to the uncertainty in analysis .    following a similar analysis as in fenimore and bloom ( 1995 ) , we take as our baseline spectra averages over the grb spectra fit by band  ( 1993 ) .",
    "each such baseline burst has associated with it an observed fluence , @xmath25 , and an observed spectral shape , @xmath26 .      *",
    "fig .  2 : * a ) the batse trigger efficiency for different @xmath20 and b ) the corrected  curve for 830 batse bursts .",
    "along with the uncorrected  curve , we depict a corrected curve corresponding to an assume standard candle energy of @xmath20 of @xmath27 ergs ( dot - dash line ) and a corrected curve where the effect of redshift on the baseline spectra is removed ( dash line ) .    since each band  ( 1993 ) burst spectrum is averaged over the duration of the burst , we assume in the following analysis that the spectral shape is constant , that is , @xmath28 .",
    "the fluences , @xmath25 [ ergs @xmath11 ] , are available for 48 of the band  ( 1993 ) bursts in batse 3b@xcite .    the observed spectral shape , @xmath26 , will not necessarily come from a burst at @xmath30 especially if @xmath20 is large .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath20 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 we first solve for the redshifts , @xmath31 , of the baseline events associated with each spectral shape .",
    "the standard candle energy , @xmath20 , is given by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normalization of the spectrum ( units of ergs kev@xmath34 ) as a function of time at the source .",
    "the comoving distance , @xmath35 , is defined in eq .  [ 2 ] of fenimore & bloom ( 1995 ) . the energy range used in calculating @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ sc_e ] ) is taken as 30 - 2000 kev , since we later compare @xmath20 to standard candle peak luminosity found in the same energy band .",
    "instead of assuming a spectral shape at the source , we use an average over baseline spectra to compute the number of expected observed bursts , @xmath41 $ ] in some fluence range [ @xmath42 : @xmath43 = \\frac{4\\pi}{n_{band } } \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{band } }   \\int_{r(s_j)}^{r(s_{j+1 } ) } \\epsilon[s_i(r ) ]   \\frac{\\rho_0}{1+z_r } r^2 dr .",
    "\\label{numbin}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the number of baseline spectra used and @xmath45 is the rate density of bursts per comoving volume .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is the predicted fluence ( using eqs .",
    "[ [ sc_e ] , [ def_fluence ] ] ) of the baseline burst if it was at a distance @xmath47 .",
    "this distance corresponds to a redshift @xmath48 .",
    "we construct 11 fluence bins ( in batse channels 2 + 3 corresponding to approximately 50 - 300 kev ) of roughly equal number of bursts .",
    "we select bursts with @xmath49 on either the 256 or 1024 ms timescale , then find a minimized @xmath50 between the number of predicted bursts and observed by varying @xmath20 . for 9 degrees of freedom",
    "we find an acceptable @xmath51 corresponding to a standard candle @xmath52 ergs .",
    "table ( [ goodfit ] ) gives the bin ranges , number of observed bursts per bin , number of predicted bursts for the best fit energy , and their implied redshifts .",
    "our fit of @xmath57 [ 30 - 2000 kev ] ergs seems a plausible number on the basis that grbs last on the average 10 sec and @xmath58 erg s@xmath34 from studies@xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath20 implies a rather large efficiency of energy conversion to @xmath0-rays ( @xmath59 ) if the bursting mechanism is colliding neutron stars ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this result would seem to help resolve the `` no - host '' problem ( cf .",
    "fenimore 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly , that the dimmest bursts ( @xmath61 erg @xmath11 ) are required to be at a redshift of @xmath62 given this @xmath20 , would seem to rule out several cosmological models that require grb progenitors to be within galaxies ( although see lu  1996 ) .",
    "this surprisingly high redshift is due to the correct blueshifting of the baseline spectra back to the source in eq .",
    "if we neglect this factor , we obtain a smaller , more tenable redshift of the dimmest bursts ( @xmath63 ) .    whatever the conclusion about the models , we note two important results .",
    "first , the bend in the  curve in batse is real , not an artifact of strong threshold effects .",
    "this implies that we are seeing either a truncated spatial distribution of grbs ( as in galactic models ) or an effect due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "the bend might also be caused by a combination of rate density or number density evolution , and a study of their possible effects is certainly warranted .",
    "secondly , with the availability of monte carlo modeling of trigger efficiencies ,  tests need no longer be inconclusive ."
