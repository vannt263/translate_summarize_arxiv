    "one of the central questions of quantum chaology is investigating which properties of the spectrum of a quantum system reflect the chaoticity of the underlying dynamics .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that if the classical limit is chaotic , the local statistical properties of the spectrum of a _ generic _ quantum system resemble those of the spectrum of a large matrix from a suitable random matrix ensemble .",
    "the choice of the ensemble depends only on very general characteristics of the system , such as whether it is time - reversal invariant , and whether spin is present . clarifying the precise meaning of the term `` generic '' above and",
    "proving the conjecture of @xcite in any generality still remains one of the most exciting questions of quantum chaology .",
    "quantum graphs make ideal models to study the questions of quantum chaology , as they exhibit the same rich variety of behaviors and share the same set of analytical tools as the more complicated systems .",
    "however one can achieve deeper understanding on graphs while using methods which are simpler yet more rigorous . and due to direct analogies between graphs and more complicated systems like billiards and cavities , any advancement on graphs",
    "will provide insight to researchers in a much wider area .",
    "it is notable that some of the recent progress in understanding the role of periodic orbits in the spectral statistics was achieved on graphs first @xcite and then extended to other systems @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we aim to exploit the analogy between the tools used in quantum chaology on billiards and graphs to analyze a recent breakthrough result by mller _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite investigate the form factor , one of the functions measuring the correlations within the spectrum of a classically chaotic quantum billiard .",
    "the advantage of the form factor lies in its convenient expansion in terms of pairs of periodic orbits of the classical system .",
    "this expansion is an application of the trace formulae ( see @xcite for a review ) and has been a starting point for many investigations .",
    "the progress in understanding the role of periodic orbits in the universal behavior of the form factor of billiard systems is marked by such milestones as the diagonal approximation @xcite , the first off - diagonal contribution @xcite and , most recently , @xcite which announced a complete expansion of the form factor for the rescaled time @xmath0 .",
    "for quantum graphs , the corresponding steps have been taken in @xcite ( the diagonal approximation ) and @xcite ( the first off - diagonal contribution ) .",
    "this article aims to lay the groundwork needed for the complete expansion .",
    "it must be mentioned that the form - factor for graphs has also been successfully analyzed using non - perturbative supersymmetric methods @xcite .    to introduce our results we need to briefly summarize the achievements of @xcite . using an expansion of the form factor as a double sum over the periodic orbits of the classical system",
    "the authors classify the periodic orbit pairs and perform the summation to recover , for @xmath0 , the result predicted by the random matrix theory .",
    "the summation can be loosely divided into two parts : evaluating the contribution of pairs of orbits related through a fixed transformation ( described as a `` diagram '' ) and summation of the resulting contributions over all possible transformations . while performing breathtaking ( and mathematically rigorous ) feats of combinatorics in the second part ,",
    "the authors remain somewhat vague on the assumptions made about the ergodic nature of the periodic orbits in the first part . by analyzing the contributions of the diagrams on quantum graphs we aim to look for possible omissions in the derivation of @xcite .",
    "we are pleased to report that , in the large , we are able to replicate and thus confirm the findings of @xcite . in doing so",
    ", however , we are forced to omit a class of periodic orbits that do not fit well into the general summation .",
    "we believe that such orbits were also omitted ( although less explicitly ) in @xcite .",
    "these are the orbits with short stretches between the self - intersections .",
    "on one hand , if the conjecture of @xcite were to hold , such orbits should not contribute to the universal final answer : the short stretches are _ not _ universal . for exactly the same reason the task of dealing with such orbits is one of the hardest .",
    "a general method of proving that their contribution is negligible is badly needed for higher terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] we discuss the definition of the quantum graphs , their spectra , the relevant statistics , the trace formula and the particular model considered .",
    "then we review the past results and difficulties encountered in section  [ sec : past ] and proceed to describe our new summation method in section  [ sec : newmethod ] .",
    "our results are compared with those of mller _ et al _ @xcite in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , where we also speculate about the possibility of periodic orbit summation beyond the heisenberg time @xmath1 .",
    "here we will describe a general approach to quantization of a graph proposed by schanz and smilansky @xcite .",
    "it shares many important features with another quantization procedure , used by several authors in the present volume ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is based on finding a self - adjoint extension of a second - order differential operator defined on the bonds of a graph .",
    "in particular , in many important cases ( such as the neumann boundary conditions ) the resulting quantum spectra coincide .    we start with a graph @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a finite set of vertices ( or nodes ) and @xmath4 is the set of directed bonds ( or edges ) .",
    "each bond has a start vertex and an end vertex , they are specified via functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the start and end vertices specify a bond uniquely : we do not allow multiple edges .",
    "we will , however , consider graphs with looping bonds , i.e.  @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "we demand that the set @xmath4 be symmetric in the sense that @xmath9 iff there is a bond @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the bond @xmath13 is called the _ reversal _ of @xmath7",
    ". a looping bond acts as its own reversal .",
    "the operation of reversal is reflexive : @xmath14 .",
    "when we refer to the `` non - directed bond @xmath7 '' we mean the couple of bonds , @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "the number of vertices is denoted by @xmath15 and the number of directed bonds is @xmath16 .",
    "the vertices are usually marked by the integers starting from 0 .",
    "the graphs we will be considering are metric , that is each bond @xmath7 has a length denoted by @xmath17 . naturally , @xmath18 . as a rule , we will be assuming that the different lengths are rationally independent , which means that the only choice of integers @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 is the trivial one : @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "now we define the quantum scattering map to be a @xmath23 unitary matrix @xmath24 here the matrix @xmath25 is diagonal with the elements @xmath26 , where @xmath17 is length of the bond @xmath7 .",
    "an element @xmath27 of the unitary matrix @xmath28 is zero unless the transition between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is possible according to the graph s geometry ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) .",
    "the evolution is defined by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are @xmath34-dimensional vectors of the wave amplitudes on the graph s bonds .",
    "the eigenvalues of the system are the wavenumbers @xmath35 at which stationary solutions exist , i.e.  @xmath36 has an eigenvalue one .",
    "the quantum evolution is time - reversal ( tr ) invariant if the elements of the matrix @xmath28 satisfy @xmath37    the corresponding classical dynamics on the graph is defined as the markov chain on the bonds of the graph with the transition matrix @xmath38 , @xmath39 one of the most exciting questions of quantum chaology on graphs is to relate the statistical properties of the spectrum of the quantum graph to the ergodic properties of the corresponding markov chain .      in this paper",

    "since often there is no unique way of increasing the size of the graphs , a separate conjecture describes the sequences that are expected to produce convergence to the rmt statistics .",
    "this conjecture , often called the `` tanner conjecture '' was formulated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; a related criterion was proposed in @xcite .",
    "they can be summarized as requiring the mixing time of the markov chain @xmath38 to grow sufficiently slowly with @xmath34 .",
    "our model , the complete fourier graphs , clearly satisfies this requirement : the mixing time is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "one of the main links connecting a quantum system to the underlying dynamics is a trace formula which expresses the eigenvalues of the quantum system through a sum over the periodic orbits of the classical system . for quantum graphs",

    "as signified by the last kronecker delta , two orbits @xmath75 and @xmath84 will contribute to the double sum only if the lengths of the orbits coincide .",
    "it is even more convenient to consider the form factor of eigenphases of the graph s scattering map . for a unitary operator , such as the matrix @xmath36 defined in ( [ eq : quantum_prop ] )",

    "to approach the task of evaluating the form factor one needs to classify possible pairs of orbits of equal length .",
    "the most simple such pair is @xmath75 and @xmath101 . since we assumed that @xmath102 , we can also take @xmath84 to be the reversal of @xmath75 : @xmath103 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that such pairs provide the leading contributing term to the form factor , called the diagonal approximation . evaluating it for graphs was studied in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we recap the derivation of the diagonal approximation for our model , the complete fourier graph , for which the number of directed edges is @xmath41 and the modulus square of amplitude of any orbit of period @xmath72 is @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 here we used the fact that there are asymptotically @xmath106 orbits on a complete graph ( we divide by @xmath72 to take into account the shifts of the same orbit ) and that the rescaled time @xmath91 is @xmath107 .      to appreciate the difficulties present when evaluating off - diagonal corrections",
    ", it is instructive to consider the simplest first correction in some detail .",
    "the first correction comes from the sieber - richter pairs @xcite , also called `` figure of eight '' orbits .",

    "we will usually denote the intersection vertex by @xmath108 . the sequence of bonds @xmath116 $ ] we call arc 1 ; the sequence @xmath117 $ ] is arc 2 .",

    "similarly for the second arc , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we define @xmath123 to be the contribution to the amplitude made by traversing arc @xmath124 , @xmath125 using the above definition and the formula for @xmath126 we can write for @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is defined by appropriately reversing the bonds in @xmath129",
    ". however , due to the reversal symmetry in the matrix @xmath28 , @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the pair @xmath132 to the form factor sum simplifies to @xmath133 with the factorization in the exponent reminiscent of the expression for the action difference in billiard systems @xcite .",
    "it is now clear how one can sum over all `` figure of eight '' orbits .",
    "the sum will run over all possible intersection vertices , over possible choices for @xmath134 and @xmath135 and over possible configurations of arc 1 and 2 ( including their length ) .",
    "this approach , however , is prone to counting orbits that should not be counted .",
    "there are two basic corrections .     or @xmath136 would result in the same partner orbit . in orbit",
    "( b ) the partner orbit , obtained by reversal of the arc 2 coincides with the orbit itself , producing a pair which was counted in the diagonal approximation already . ]",
    "the first correction comes from the orbits in which @xmath137 , fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ]  ( a ) . in this case",
    "the orbit runs along itself and one can use @xmath136 as another intersection point .",
    "it is clear , however , that this choice would produce the same partner orbit @xmath84 .",
    "a solution proposed in @xcite was to define the intersection point to be the leftmost vertex in such an `` extended '' intersection .",
    "in essence , this amounts to only counting the intersections with @xmath138 .",
    "this condition was called a _",
    "restriction_. in the present paper we modify this approach .",
    "another problem would arise if one of the arcs , say arc 2 , was self - retracing . one of the simplest examples is when @xmath139 and arc 2 contains just one bond , a loop from @xmath136 to itself , fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ]  ( b ) . in this case , reversing arc 2 would give back the same orbit @xmath75 and the pairing of @xmath75 with itself was already counted in the diagonal approximation .",
    "such orbits were termed _",
    "exceptions _ in @xcite ; they were evaluated separately and subtracted from the previous result .",
    "we note that the previously imposed restriction @xmath138 means that there can be no exceptions with arc 1 being self - retracing .",
    "this shows that restrictions and exceptions can not be treated independently .",
    "it should also be noted that both restrictions and exceptions must be treated carefully in order to get the correct result .    to find higher order terms , orbits fitting more complicated intersection patterns have to be considered .",
    "diagrams were used in @xcite and @xcite to describe the relationship between the orbits @xmath75 and @xmath84 ( i.e. which arcs get reversed ) .",
    "it proved to be hard to find and reconcile all the exceptions and restrictions .",
    "we believe that the approach proposed in this paper helps to systematize the choice of restrictions in such a way that we avoid treating exceptions altogether .",
    "this approach was inspired by the recent work on billiard @xcite .",
    "it has its own shortcoming which will be discussed .",
    "we believe that this shortcoming applies to @xcite as well .",
    "we start by illustrating our approach on the simplest nontrivial diagram , the `` figure of eight '' .",
    "the trick is to introduce restrictions on _ both _ sides of the `` extended '' intersection and then sum over all possible intersection lengths , see fig .  [",
    "fig : diag2 ] .",
    "it turns out that we need to evaluate the first type of orbits on fig .",
    "[ fig : diag2 ] separately .",
    "the contribution of such orbits reads @xmath140 where we have implemented restrictions by using the kronecker deltas .",
    "the term @xmath141 counts the number of ways to complete the orbit by choosing the arc configurations .",
    "the two arcs are uniquely defined by the vertices they pass through . between the two of them",
    ", they pass through @xmath142 vertices ( we have already chosen 6 vertices of the orbit : @xmath119 , @xmath136 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath108 twice ) .",
    "thus there are @xmath145 ways to choose the lengths of the arcs and @xmath146 ways to choose the vertices themselves , leading to @xmath147 .",
    "going back to ( [ eq : diag2_0 ] ) , we open one of the brackets to obtain @xmath148 in both terms we perform the sum over @xmath143 . since @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the first sum is identically 0 . in the second we substitute @xmath151 throughout to get @xmath152",
    "the obtained result is out of order : since @xmath153 , we got an answer of the order @xmath154 .",
    "thus it is vital to evaluate the corrections from the extended intersections .",
    "it is easy to see that for orbits with an extended intersection , @xmath155 is independent of the orbit configuration and is equal to @xmath104 . for an intersection of length @xmath156",
    ", there are @xmath157 possible arc configurations .",
    "there are also @xmath158 ways to choose the vertices denoted by the shaded circles on fig .",
    "[ fig : diag2 ] and @xmath159 ways to choose the vertices denoted by the empty circles .",
    "the total contribution is @xmath160 the contribution of all `` figure of eight '' orbits is thus @xmath161 taking into account that @xmath153 , we recover the correct second - order correction @xmath162 .",
    "if we restrict the sum over @xmath156 to the values up to @xmath163 , we get a correction term of the form @xmath164 which decays faster than exponentially as we send @xmath72 and @xmath40 to infinity .      to gain some intuition for the general case we evaluate the contributions of two of the five diagrams contributing to the third order .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed list of the third order diagrams and their `` multiplicities '' .",
    "the treatment of these diagrams was also performed for disordered systems in @xcite , and for chaotic billiards in @xcite .    , @xmath165 .",
    "]    the first diagram we evaluate is the `` sausage '' orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag3a ] . here",
    "we need to require that all arcs ( depicted by dashed lines ) are at least one bond long .",
    "as noted by h.  schanz @xcite this restriction excludes some potentially contributing orbits .",
    "why they do not contribute to the form factor is a non - trivial question .",
    "in particular such orbits are not `` rare '' enough to guarantee _ a priori _ that their contribution is vanishingly small .",
    "we conducted a separate study to evaluate the missing orbits for this particular diagram and discovered that cancellations akin to those in ( [ eq : diag2 ] ) ensure they do not contribute .",
    "however , we are not aware of any general argument applicable to higher diagrams .    in the intersections of length 0 ( first and second line in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag3a ] ) we open up one of the restrictions , in the same way as in ( [ eq : diag2_0_cont1 ] ) .",
    "another component necessary is the number of ways to complete the orbit by choosing the configurations of the 4 arcs .",
    "this is equal to @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the number of possible choices for the lengths of the arcs  essentially the number of partitions of @xmath72 into an ordered sum of 4 natural numbers .",
    "now the total contribution of the diagram is @xmath168        next we evaluate a diagram with a triple intersection , shown in fig .",

    "the restrictions now mean that the three vertices can not be all equal . in terms of kronecker deltas",
    "it is implemented as @xmath169 .",
    "we again require that all arcs have non - zero bond lengths ; this requirement excludes some orbits that ought to be counted .",
    "we must also note that in this case the restrictions do not fully rule out counting of orbits that ought to be excepted , for example the orbits with self - retracing arcs .",
    "the contributions of such orbits can not be ruled out _ a priori _  they occur often enough to contribute to the third order in @xmath91 .",
    "however they do not contribute ( as signified by the results of @xcite ) due to cancellations which should be studied separately .",
    "turning a blind eye to these special orbits , we can evaluate the contributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : diag3b ] .",
    "there are now @xmath170 arc configurations , where @xmath171 dealing with @xmath165 case separately we arrive to @xmath172      the big advantage of the new way of evaluating diagrams is that the restrictions we impose essentially decouple different intersections from each other .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to write a general formula for a contribution of a diagram using only the information about the number of intersections and not how they are interconnected .",
    "consider the `` sausage '' diagram again .",
    "to write its contribution in a more uniform fashion we introduce a special factor , defined for @xmath173 , @xmath174 we can now rewrite the sums for @xmath175 in the following form : @xmath176 where @xmath177 in the first summand of ( [ eq : diag3a_re ] ) , @xmath76 is a dummy variable since @xmath178 unless @xmath179 . in the second summand",

    "the summation over all diagrams , described in @xcite would then recover the predicted random matrix result .",
    "however the final result , ( [ eq : gen_contr ] ) , was obtained at the cost of ignoring the orbits which can be generally characterized as having short stretches between self - intersections .",
    "we believe that the same omission was used in @xcite , described in particular in the paragraph immediately following eq.(16 ) ( the discussion in appendix d.2 is also relevant ) .",
    "while not claiming that the same applies to billiard systems , we can testify that on graphs the contribution of the orbits with very short stretches is _ absolutely divergent _ in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "this underlines the need to analyze the unitary cancellations which ensure that such orbits do not contribute to the final answer .",
    "the missing analysis also holds the key to the possibility of extending the discussed summation to systems with slower mixing .",
    "now that we have more understanding of how the universal contributions to the form factor arise from the sum of periodic orbits in the region @xmath0 , the question of why the expansion techniques break down beyond the heisenberg time @xmath1 comes to the forefront .",
    "it seems , that if we are to recover the random matrix prediction for @xmath201 , the periodic orbit contributions would have to be classified in an entirely different way .",
    "quite possibly , the summation needs to be based on the degeneracy classes  the sets of orbits of the same length  rather than on the diagram partition which is in a way transversal to the degeneracy class partition .",
    "such degeneracy - based summation has been performed before for a special type of graphs , the neumann star graphs @xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview of the results ) .",
    "the radius of convergence of the expansion was found to be finite but , if re - summed @xcite , the result was valid for all values of @xmath91 .",
    "important input for the question of going beyond @xmath1 can also be obtained by comparing the periodic orbit expansions with the non - perturbative methods of @xcite which are valid for all @xmath91 ."
