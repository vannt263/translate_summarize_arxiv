    "random tessellations * st*able with respect to * it*erations ( stit ) have recently been introduced in @xcite and @xcite as a new model for random tessellation in @xmath3 and have quickly attracted considerable interest in modern stochastic geometry as well fitting the growing demand for non - trivial and flexible but mathematically tractable tessellation models . the stit tessellations may be interpreted as outcome of a random cell division process , which makes them very attractive for applications , see for example @xcite .",
    "other potential applications include mathematical modelling of systems of cracks , joints or fissures in rock or the so - called craquele of thin layers .",
    "a general approach to random cell division processes has recently appeared in @xcite and the construction of stit tessellations can roughly be described as follows . at first",
    ", we fix a compact and convex window @xmath1 in which the construction is carried out . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath4 to be a polytope , as this implies that the resulting tessellation has polytopal cells with probability one .",
    "next , an exponentially random life time is assigned to @xmath4 , whereby the parameter of the distribution is given as a constant multiple of the integral - geometric mean width of @xmath4 , see section [ secstit ] for details . upon expiry of this life time a @xmath4 hitting uniform random hyperplane is chosen , is introduced in @xmath4 and divides the window into two polytopal sub - cells @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the construction continues now recursively and independently in both of these sub - cells , where the newly introduced hyperplanes are always chopped - off by the boundaries of their mother - cells .",
    "the whole construction is continued until some deterministic time threshold @xmath0 is reached .",
    "regarded in time , the construction can by interpreted as a pure - jump markov process on the space of tessellations of the window @xmath4 .",
    "+ our construction shares some common features with random fragmentation processes or branching markov chains in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the cells of the resulting tessellation within @xmath4 can be regarded as particles in a suitable polish space and the dynamics of the particles is non - interacting in a sense that different particles ( cells of the tessellation ) have independent evolutions , which is indeed the case in our construction . moreover ,",
    "whenever a particle dies it is replaced by exactly two new particles , namely the two newly generated sub - cells .",
    "in addition , the life times of the particles are exponentially distributed , as assumed in @xcite , but in general not independent in contrast to the fragmentation theory .",
    "+ in the recent paper @xcite the authors have introduced a new technique for studying the geometric properties of stit tessellations based on martingales and the general theory of martingale problems for pure - jump type markov processes . in particular , with these new developments , the variance of the total surface area of a stationary and isotropic iteration stable random tessellation @xmath7 in @xmath1 ( a random stit tessellation ) has been determined by integral - geometric means and the corresponding central limit theory has been established .",
    "strikingly , as already signalled by results in the special two dimensional case @xcite , and as confirmed by the results of the present paper , it turns out that in a certain rather strong sense the asymptotic behaviour of the surface area process dominates and fully determines the asymptotic geometry of the stit tessellation .",
    "in particular the surface area variance is _ the _ basic second - order parameter of the tessellation and all second - order characteristics of functionals considered in our work can be reduced to it , likewise non - trivial functional limits in law exist for the stit surface area process whereas the limits in law for other natural related processes arise as deterministic functionals of the corresponding surface process .",
    "another crucial phenomenon arising in this context , as first noted in @xcite , is that the asymptotic theories for dimension @xmath8 and @xmath9 differ strongly in many important aspects .",
    "we have studied the planar case @xmath8 in the recent separate paper @xcite and thus only consider @xmath9 in the present one .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to establish a second - order and limit theory for integral - geometric characteristics of stationary and isotropic stit tessellations in dimensions higher than two .",
    "more precisely , the characteristics studied in this work are the cumulative intrinsic volumes of all orders for the collections of so - called maximal polytopes of @xmath7 .",
    "these are in codimension @xmath10 the cell - separating facets introduced during the random cell division process described above , constituting the basic building blocks of a stit tessellation as discussed in detail below .",
    "we shall provide explicit as well as asymptotic variance expressions for these parameters of the random tessellation @xmath11 as @xmath12 tends to infinity for a sequence @xmath13 of expanding convex windows .",
    "further , we will find the covariance measures for random lower - dimensional face measures generated by @xmath14 finally , we shall also give the corresponding convergence in law statements , obtaining non - gaussian limits for the studied case @xmath15 as opposed to the classical gaussian limits arising for @xmath8 , see @xcite .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secstit ] we define stit tessellations , specializing to the stationary and isotropic set - up in the focus of this paper , and we discuss their basic properties that are needed in our arguments .",
    "next , in section [ sec2ndord ] we calculate the variances of the cumulative intrinsic volumes of all orders for stit tessellations .",
    "this includes both , exact formulae and asymptotic analysis upon letting the window size grow to infinity .",
    "further , in section [ sec2ndmeas ] we extend the second - order analysis to the level of lower - dimensional face measures induced by stit tessellations , thus taking into account not only the numeric characteristics but also the spatial profile of the stit face processes .",
    "finally , in section [ secclt ] we develop the corresponding functional limit theory with non - gaussian limit processes for @xmath16 in order to keep the paper self - contained , we will recall important faces from @xcite and sketch some of their proofs for the readers convenience .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide a short self - contained discussion of stit tessellations in @xmath3 as studied in this paper and to summarize their basic properties for easy reference .",
    "we will restrict to the stationary and isotropic case in subsection [ subsecmnwc ] below , specializing to the scope of the paper . the general reference for these  by now classical ",
    "properties throughout this section is @xcite .",
    "next , in subsection [ subsecmart ] we will discuss the martingale tools developed in @xcite and underlying our present theory .",
    "finally , in subsection [ subsec1stord ] we provide certain useful mean value relationships for intrinsic volumes in context of stit tessellations .",
    "we start with a compact and convex polytope @xmath1 in which our construction is carried out and denote by @xmath17 the standard isometry - invariant measure on the space @xmath18 of ( affine ) hyperplanes in @xmath3 normalized so as to induce unit surface intensity on @xmath19 ( note that in our earlier papers @xcite and @xcite this measure has been denoted by @xmath20 ) .",
    "we call @xmath17 the _ driving measure _ of the construction .",
    "assign now to @xmath4 an exponentially random lifetime with parameter @xmath21)$ ] , where @xmath22:=\\{h\\in{\\cal h}:\\ h\\cap w\\neq\\emptyset\\}\\ ] ] is the set of hyperplanes hitting @xmath4 . upon expiry of this random life time",
    ", a random hyperplane is chosen according to the distribution @xmath21)^{-1}\\lambda(\\cdot\\cap[w])$ ] , is introduced in @xmath4 and is chopped off by its boundary .",
    "this is , the window @xmath4 splits into the two polyhedral sub - cells @xmath5 and @xmath6 that are separated by the introduced hyperplane piece .",
    "the construction continues now recursively and independently in @xmath5 and @xmath6 and is stopped if some previously fixed deterministic time threshold @xmath23 is reached .",
    "our assumptions ensure that the cells of the tessellation constructed until time @xmath23 are convex polyhedra in @xmath4 with probability one .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath24 and we denote by @xmath7 the random closed set in @xmath4 that consists of the union of cell - boundaries of cells constructed until time @xmath0 , see figure [ figure ] . the construction of @xmath7 is referred to as the _ mnw - construction _ after the names of its inventors  mecke , nagel and weiss  and the tessellation @xmath7 itself is called a random _",
    "stit tessellation_. the abbreviation stit comes from the crucial property enjoyed by @xmath25 namely that of being able under eration , for which we refer to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we call the cell separating @xmath26-dimensional faces the _ @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytopes _ and denote the collection of all such polytopes of @xmath7 by @xmath27 . moreover , we introduce the set @xmath28 of @xmath29-dimensional faces of @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytopes of @xmath7 by @xmath30 where by @xmath31 we mean the set of all @xmath29-dimensional faces of the @xmath26-dimensional polytope @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the maximal polytopes are often referred to as _",
    "i - polytopes _  this terminology originates from the historically first considered particular case @xmath8 where the maximal polytopes ( which are just line segments in this case ) assumed shapes similar to the literal @xmath34 +         it is an important observation that the spatio - temporal construction of @xmath7 satisfies the markov property in time parameter @xmath0 , which means that @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the operation of iteration of tessellations , see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . to make the paper more",
    "self - contained , we recall now the definition of the meaning of the operation @xmath36 . to this end , we regard the tessellation @xmath7 as a frame or primary tessellation and associate with each cell @xmath37 an i.i.d .",
    "copy @xmath38 of @xmath39 .",
    "another tessellation @xmath40 of @xmath4 is now defined as @xmath41 i.e. we consider the union of @xmath7 and the cut - outs of @xmath38 s within the cells @xmath42 of the primary tessellation ( note that in the definition we have used the interpretation of a tessellation as a random closed subset of @xmath4 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath40 is the _ iteration _ of @xmath7 with @xmath39 .",
    "the remarkable property of our tessellations constructed by the mnw - process is that the outcome @xmath43 coincides in law with @xmath44 , i.e. with the continuation of the mnw - construction until time @xmath45 .",
    "thus , it is the same either to continue the mnw - construction from @xmath0 until time @xmath45 or to perform at time @xmath0 an iteration of @xmath7 with @xmath39 .",
    "+ the local properties established so far , can be extended to the whole space , since the random tessellations @xmath7 are _ consistent _ in @xmath4 , by which we mean that for any fixed @xmath23 and @xmath46 it holds @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for equality in distribution .",
    "this implies  in view of the consistency theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3.1 )  the existence of the whole - space tessellation @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for each compact convex @xmath1 .",
    "+ it directly follows from the markov property that the random tessellations @xmath49 are stable with respect to the operation @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 means the dilation with a factor @xmath53 .",
    "this property explains also the abbreviation stit , because the last equation is a classical probabilistic stability relation .",
    "the random tessellations @xmath49 share another important property , namely that the _ intersection _ of @xmath49 with a @xmath29-dimensional plane @xmath54 , @xmath55 , is again an iteration stable random tessellation .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath56 and the integral - geometric constant @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 see eq .",
    "( 3.29 t ) in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see from the properties of the capacity functional of @xmath49 , compare with ( * ? ? ?",
    "5(ii ) ) , that stit tessellations have the following _ scaling property _ : @xmath59 i.e. the tessellation @xmath49 has , upon rescaling with the factor @xmath60 the same distribution as @xmath61 , that is the stit tessellation with surface intensity @xmath10 .",
    "+ we close this section by mentioning that the random tessellations @xmath49 have another important property , namely that @xmath49 has _ poisson typical cells _ or poisson cells for short , see lemma 3 in @xcite or part ( 1 ) of proposition [ propxx ] below .",
    "this is to say , the typical cell of @xmath49 has the same distribution as the typical cell of a stationary and isotropic poisson hyperplane tessellation with surface density @xmath0 ( see chap . 10.3 in @xcite for references about the classical poisson hyperplane model ) . in particular , this fact combined with the intersection property from above",
    "shows that the typical cell of the lower dimensional stit tessellation @xmath62 , with @xmath54 as above , has the same distribution as the typical cell of a poisson hyperplane tessellation in @xmath63 with surface density @xmath64 .",
    "more formally , we define the cell intensity measure @xmath65 of the stit tessellation @xmath7 by @xmath66 and its @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytope intensity measure @xmath67 by @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for the uni mass dirac measure concentrated at @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath71 be the cell intensity measure and @xmath72 be the @xmath26-face intensity measure of a poisson hyperplane tessellation @xmath73 within @xmath1 having intensity measure @xmath74 , which are defined similarly to @xmath65 and @xmath67 above ( clearly , the @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytopes have to be replaced by the set of @xmath26-faces of @xmath73 ) .",
    "these definitions bring us in the position to reformulate special cases of theorems 1 and 2 from @xcite adapted to our later purposes :    [ propxx ] we have @xmath75      as already noted above , the mnw - construction of iteration stable random tessellations @xmath7 in finite volumes @xmath1 enjoys a markov property in the continuous time parameter @xmath76 in our previous work @xcite we have used this fact combined with the classical theory of martingale problems for pure jump markov processes to construct a class of natural martingales associated to the mnw - process . in this paper",
    "we only need a part of that theory .",
    "to formulate it we let @xmath77 be a bounded and measurable functional on the space of @xmath26-polytopes in @xmath3 and we denote by @xmath78 the collection of @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytopes of a tessellation @xmath79 standing for a generic realization of @xmath7 for some @xmath80 write @xmath81 any hyperplane @xmath82 $ ] hitting the window @xmath4 is tessellated by the intersection with @xmath79 and we denote by @xmath83 the set of all @xmath26-dimensional cells of this tessellation and introduce @xmath84}\\sum_{f\\in{\\operatorname{cells}}(y\\cap h)}\\phi(f)\\lambda(dh).\\ ] ] it is also convenient to introduce the bar notation for centered versions of these quantities with @xmath85 that is to say @xmath86 and likewise @xmath87 with this notation , in view of the results developed in @xcite , we have    [ martprop ] for bounded and measurable functionals @xmath77 and @xmath88 on the space of @xmath26-polytopes in @xmath3 , the stochastic processes @xmath89 and @xmath90ds\\label{mart2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are martingales with respect to the filtration @xmath91 induced by @xmath92 .    [ [ sketch - of - a - proof ] ] sketch of a proof : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to make the paper self - contained , we give here the main idea of the proof of proposition [ martprop ] , although there is some overlap with @xcite .",
    "+ at first , it is a direct consequence of the mnw - construction that the generator @xmath93 of the pure - jump markov process @xmath7 , @xmath23 , is given by @xmath94}\\sum_{f\\in{\\operatorname{cells}}(y\\cap h)}[f(y\\cup f)-f(y)]\\lambda(dh),\\ ] ] where @xmath79 stands for some instant of @xmath7 and @xmath95 is a bounded and measurable function on the space of tessellations of @xmath4 .",
    "applying now the classical dynkin formula ( see for example lemma 19.21 in @xcite ) with @xmath96 gives the martingale property of the random process ( [ mart1 ] ) .",
    "( it should be mentioned that so defined @xmath95 need not to be bounded in general . however",
    ", this technical difficulty can be overcome with a suitable localization argument . )",
    "+ for the second statement we consider the time - augmented random process @xmath97 , @xmath23 , which has generator @xmath98 given by @xmath99(y)+\\left[{\\partial\\over\\partial t}g(y,\\cdot)\\right](t)\\ ] ] for appropriate functions @xmath100 .",
    "now , using dynkin s formula now for the product process @xmath97 and with @xmath101 , @xmath102 , gives ( again after a suitable localization argument ) the martingale property of the random process @xmath103 for another functional @xmath88 we can apply the latter property for @xmath104 and @xmath105 and subtract the two results , which shows the martingale property of the random process ( [ mart2]).@xmath106      in this subsection we discuss certain basic first - order consequences of proposition [ martprop ] to be of use for our future reference .",

    "we denote by @xmath139 the density of the @xmath29-th intrinsic volume of the collection of @xmath26-dimensional maximal polytopes of @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath140 for arbitrary compact windows @xmath1 with @xmath141 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "using now proposition [ propofirstorder ] we get @xmath142 because of the homogeneity of intrinsic volumes . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown in @xcite that @xmath143 where here and in the sequel we denote by @xmath144 , @xmath145 , the volume of the @xmath146-dimensional unit ball . indeed , these two values are identical , since @xmath147    [ rema1 ] our first - order formula from the last proposition contains the extra boundary correction term @xmath148 in contrast to our mean value formula ( [ xxxeqmean ] ) from @xcite .",
    "these additional terms come from the fact that we consider maximal polytopes possibly chopped off by the boundary of the domain @xmath4 rather than the points of an associated center function for full facets in @xmath149 thus , it may happen for instance that in two neighbouring regions one observes two facets which can coalesce when putting these regions together into one volume , whence the lower - order finite volume corrections arise .",
    "in this section we develop a full second - order theory for intrinsic volumes of stationary and isotropic random stit tessellations .",
    "this is first done exactly in subsection [ subsecexact ] for @xmath150 inside a bounded convex observation window @xmath1 .",
