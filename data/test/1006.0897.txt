    "[ fig : direct - tunn - field - emiss ] ) and for an extended energy barrier @xcite , the electron tunneling becomes unidirectional for rather high source - drain voltages , of the order of electrodes bandwidth ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "so , a transition from bidirectional tunneling to unidirectional tunneling occurs in both cases by sufficiently rising the voltage .",
    "the difference from the traditional vacuum electronics is that the `` triangular '' barrier regime encountered in molecular electronics does not _ necessarily _ refer to a situation where the backward tunneling is impossible but rather to situations where it is substantially inhibited . as expressed by eqs .",

    "( [ eq - i ] ) , would exhibit a significant dependence on the applied bias @xmath4 , and band edge effects could also become relevant even for a point - like molecule .",

    "@xcite , the results obtained for a point - like molecule within and without the wide band approximation practically coincide up to voltages @xmath82 .    as visible in the aforementioned figures of ref .",
    "@xcite , the current rapidly increases at @xmath83 .",
    "the physical reason for this stepwise increase is that the frontier orbital becomes ( nearly ) resonant with the electrochemical potential of one electrode [ @xmath84 for the n - type conduction supposed in the present figures ] .",
    "similar to @xmath85 , this voltage @xmath86 is also straightforwardly related to the energy offset ( @xmath87 ) ; it corresponds to an inflexion point of the @xmath3-@xmath4-characteristics @xcite .",
    "this might suggest an alternative experimental procedure to determine @xmath19 from @xmath86 .",
    "while this method poses no problems for theoretical calculations , it is unlikely that this method is experimentally viable : it is hardly conceivable that a molecular junction could support the high currents at voltages @xmath88 significantly higher than @xmath89 . by inspecting fig .",
    "1 and 2 of ref .  @xcite as well as the present fig .  [ fig : iv - nature ] , one can remark that the high @xmath4-ranges sampled in the measurements comprise only small portions ( @xmath90 ) of the fowler - nordheim regime , ( presumably ) just because the currents become too high .    to conclude ,",
    "what really happens at the transition voltage is that the frontier molecular orbital draws closer to the ( electro)chemical potential of one electrode but still remains sufficiently distant from it .",
    "when the source - drain voltage is raised , the point @xmath91 is reached before reaching the point @xmath92 .",
    "switching now to the physical aspects , i note the following . the differences between the two models considered in secs .  [ sec - exp ] and [ sec - pcm ] become notable only for nearly resonant frontier molecular orbitals @xmath93 . the fact that these differences are significant for @xmath93",
    "can easily be understood if one bears in mind that the semiclassical ( wkb ) calculations related to the model of an extended molecule do not account for finite width effects , which are important for the tunneling through a barrier of small height .    definitely , the condition @xmath94 holds in the experimental situation : by assuming a point - like molecule , from fig .",
