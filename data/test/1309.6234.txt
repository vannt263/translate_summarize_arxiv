    "a higgs boson has been discovered at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , whose properties ; @xmath3 , mass , spin , cp and observed number of events are consistent with those of the higgs boson predicted in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson also appears in higgs sectors extended from the sm one , so that there are still various possibilities non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "they are often introduced in models beyond the sm which have been considered to explain problems unsolved within the sm such as the neutrino oscillation , dark matter ( dm ) and baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "in addition to the above problems , one of the deepest mystery in the sm is the flavor structure . in the sm ,",
    "all the masses of charged fermions are accommodated by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet field through yukawa interactions .",
    "however , there are redundant number of parameters to obtain physical observables ; @xmath4 the yukawa couplings are given by general @xmath5 complex matrices ( totally 18 degrees of freedom ) for each up - type and down - type quarks and charged - leptons .",
    "in fact , only three independent parameters are enough in the charged - leptons sector to describe the masses of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in order to constrain the structure of yukawa interactions , non",
    "- abelian discrete symmetries have been introduced such as based on the @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite groups .",
    "usually , in a model with such a discrete symmetry , the higgs sector is extended to be the multi - doublet structure .",
    "therefore , phenomenological studies for the extended higgs sector with multi - doublet structure are important to probe such a model .    in this paper , we discuss two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) with the @xmath0 symmetry as the simplest realization of the diagonalized mass matrix for the charged - leptons without introducing any unitary matrices .",
    "this can be achieved by assigning the first and second generation lepton fields to be the @xmath0 doublet charge assignments for the quarks and higgs doublet fields are different from those in the previous studies for @xmath0 models  @xcite .",
    "usually , all the quarks , leptons and higgs doublet fields are embedded in the @xmath0 doublet plus singlet .",
    "however , we treat that the quark sector is the same as in the sm assuming the quark fields to be the singlet , because it is suitable and economical to explain the observed sm - like higgs boson at the lhc . ] .",
    "in general , there appears the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) via a neutral higgs boson mediation at the tree level in two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) , which is strictly constrained by flavor experiments .",
    "usually , such a tree level fcnc is forbidden by introducing a discrete @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite to realize the situation where one of two higgs doublet fields couples to each fermion . in our model , this situation is realized in terms of the @xmath0 flavor symmetry .",
    "the yukawa interaction among the higgs doublet fields and fermions can be classified into four types depending on the @xmath0 charge assignments to the right - handed fermions .",
    "similar classification has been defined in thdms with a softly - broken @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review for the thdms with the softly - broken @xmath1 symmetry has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that extra neutral and charged higgs bosons can be muon and electron specific ; namely , they can mainly decay into @xmath10 or @xmath11 and @xmath12 or @xmath13 , respectively , in one of four types of the yukawa interaction .",
    "this phenomena can not be seen in any other thdms without the tree level fcnc such as the softly - broken @xmath1 symmetric version .",
    "we show excluded parameter regions from the current lhc data in this scenario .",
    "we then evaluate discovery potential of signal events from these extra higgs bosons at the lhc with the collision energy to be 14 tev .",

    "ii , we define the particle content and give the lagrangian in our model .",
    "the mass matrices for the charged - leptons and neutrinos are then calculated .",
    "the higgs boson interactions are also discussed in this section . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the collider phenomenology , especially focusing on the muon and electron specific higgs bosons in the type - i @xmath0 model .",
    "we give a summary and conclusion of this paper in sec .",
    "the explicit form of the higgs potential and mass matrices for the scalar fields are given in appendix  a.",
    "we discuss the thdm with the softly - broken discrete @xmath0 symmetry . in the @xmath0 group , there are the following irreducible representations ; two singlets @xmath14 ( true - singlet ) and @xmath15 ( pseudo - singlet ) and doublet @xmath16 ( see ref .",

    "the left- ( right- ) handed electron and muon @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are embedded as the doublet representation of the @xmath0 symmetry . both left - handed and right - handed",

    "we call them as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y @xmath0 models , and the @xmath0 charge assignment in each model is listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "this charge assignment is the analogy of that of a softly - broken @xmath1 symmetry in the thdms  @xcite .",

    "we note that we can retain the @xmath1 symmetry as the subgroup of @xmath0 by taking @xmath36 .",
    "however , the potential without the @xmath34 term results non - decoupling theory ; namely , all the masses of higgs bosons are determined by the higgs vev times @xmath37 couplings . in the following , we consider the case with @xmath38 .",
    "the mass eigenstates for the cp - odd , singly - charged and cp - even higgs bosons from the doublet fields are given by the following orthogonal matrices as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the nambu - goldstone bosons which are absorbed by the longitudinal component of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . because the potential given in eq .",

    "the renormalizable yukawa lagrangian under the @xmath0 invariance is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 are @xmath46 or @xmath26 depending on the @xmath0 charge assignment of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 as listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .",

    "in such a model , there are predictions in the quark sector such as the cabibbo mixing angle . in our model",
    ", we choose singlet representations for all the quark fields and higgs doublet fields , so that there is no such a prediction .",

    "the discrepancy of the measured muon @xmath70 from the sm prediction is roughly given as @xmath78  @xcite which is two orders of magnitude larger than the above result with @xmath76 gev and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to compensate the discrepancy by the additional scalar boson loop contributions in our model similar to the type - ii thdm .",
    "in this section , we discuss the phenomenology of the higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "we consider the case with @xmath68 in which @xmath69 can be regarded as the sm - like higgs boson with the mass of 126 gev , because the current higgs boson search data at the lhc suggest that the observed higgs boson is consistent with the sm higgs boson .",
    "we then focus on collider signatures from the extra higgs bosons ; @xmath80 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 at the lhc .",
    "in all the @xmath0 models defined in table  [ tab:2 ] , the coupling constants of the extra higgs bosons with @xmath7 and @xmath6 are respectively proportional to ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath82 ) as seen in eq .",

    "thus , the extra higgs bosons are expected to be @xmath7 and @xmath6 specific in large or small @xmath83 regions ; @xmath4 @xmath84 is typically disfavored by the @xmath85 physics data such as the @xmath86 process  @xcite . ] .",
    "however , this feature is hidden in the type - ii , type - x and type - y @xmath0 models , because at least one of the bottom or tau yukawa couplings is also enhanced as getting larger values of @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , phenomenology in the type - ii , type - x and type - y @xmath0 models are almost the same as those in the type - ii , type - x and type - y thdms with the softly - broken @xmath1 symmetry , respectively .",

    "we would like to emphasize that appearance of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 specific extra higgs bosons does not appear in the other thdms without the tree level fcnc ; @xmath3 , the @xmath1 symmetric version and the thdms with yukawa alignments discussed in ref .",
    "in such a thdm , the interaction matrices among a higgs boson and fermions are proportional to the fermion mass matrices .",
    "therefore , the branching fractions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are suppressed by the factors of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , compared to that of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes an extra neutral higgs boson .",
    "if we consider the most general thdm , sometimes it is called as the type - iii thdm  @xcite , in which both higgs doublet fields couple to each fermion , such a proportionality between the matrices can be broken in general . in that case , the @xmath7 and @xmath6 specific extra higgs bosons can be obtained by choosing parameters in the interaction matrix .",
    "the important point in our model is that we can explain the @xmath7 and @xmath6 specific nature as a consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry .",

    "we find that @xmath71 and @xmath72 with their masses up to 350 gev can be discovered by 5@xmath180 in the case of @xmath170 with 300 fb@xmath127 . in the 3000 fb@xmath127 luminosity ,",
    "the discovery reach can be above 350 gev when @xmath170 .",
    "we have studied the thdms in the framework based on the @xmath0 flavor symmetry . assigning the first and second generation lepton fields ( two higgs doublet fields ) to be the doublet ( singlet ) under @xmath0",
    ", the mass matrix for the charged - leptons is obtained to be the diagonal form in the weak eigenbasis .",
    "the quark masses and mixings are explained as the same way in the sm by assuming the @xmath0 charge for quarks to be the singlet .",
    "the @xmath0 charge assignment to the higgs doublet fields in our model , which is different from the previous studies for @xmath0 models where the higgs fields are usually taken to be the @xmath0 doublet , is suitable to explain the sm - like higgs boson with the mass of 126 gev discovered at the lhc .",
    "the tree level fcnc appearing in the general thdms is forbidden by the @xmath0 symmetry in our model set up in which four types of the yukawa interaction are allowed depending on the @xmath0 charge assignments for fermions named as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y @xmath0 models .",
    "we have found that the extra higgs bosons @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be electron and muon specific in the type - i @xmath0 model in the large @xmath83 regions .",
    "namely , the decay modes of @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are dominant , and the branching fraction for the muon final state is almost the same as that for the electron final state",
    ". this property does not appear in any other thdms without the tree level fcnc such as a @xmath2 symmetric version of the thdms .",
    "therefore , measuring signatures of the @xmath184 specific extra higgs bosons can be a direct probe of our model .",
    "we have explored excluded regions on the @xmath83-@xmath142 plane has been evaluated as shown in fig .",
    "[ bound_gfusion ] by using the higgs boson search data of the dimuon decay mode data and the same - sign dimuon event .",
    "we also have estimated the 5@xmath180 discovery potential of the @xmath172 signal assuming the center of mass energy to be 14 tev and the integrated luminosity to be 300 fb@xmath127 and 3000 fb@xmath127 .",
