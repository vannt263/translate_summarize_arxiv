    "understanding the origin of spiral arms , bars , and rings is key for discerning the long - term evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "the density wave ( dw ) theory , originally conceived by  @xcite and developed in a linear form by  @xcite , has been commonly brought up to explain spiral structure .",
    "one fundamental prediction of this theory is the presence of offsets between tracers of the different stages of star formation and evolution  @xcite .",
    "a manifestation of these offsets would be age / color gradients across arms , as a result of the interaction between a spiral pattern with an angular speed that is nearly constant with radius , and stars and gas with differential rotation .",
    "the gas overtakes the spiral pattern inside corotation ( cr , i.e. , the radius where the pattern and orbital angular velocities are the same ) , and is left behind outside cr . as gas feels the gravitational potential near the spiral arms , it shocks  @xcite .",
    "this produces the piling up of dust and molecular gas that is commonly found in the concave side of the arms , if the process occurs inside cr and spiral arms trail .",
    "if the shock triggers star formation , an age ( or color ) gradient is expected across spiral arms as the new stars age and drift away from the arms .",
    "young stars would be located immediately downstream the dust lanes , followed by increasingly older stars in the direction of rotation . in part due to the difficulties encountered to detect such gradients , the relevance of spiral dws for disk galaxies has been repeatedly challenged .",
    "recent examples are @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .    in a series of papers , we have detected and studied azimuthal color / age gradients across spiral arms and bars , thus establishing a relation between spiral or bar dynamics and star formation  @xcite .",
    "our studies suggest that azimuthal gradients can be found in almost every galaxy , but are difficult to detect and do not appear widespread within a single galaxy .",
    "@xcite has noticed an inverse correlation between the signatures of a spiral shock , and the presence of chains of star complexes ( `` beads on a string '' ) in spiral arms ; he has also observed that spiral shocks seem to be associated with an irregular magnetic field  @xcite , whereas the  beads on a string \" configuration correlates with the existence of a regular magnetic field . pc , irrespective of central column density  @xcite . ]    the `` infant mortality '' of star clusters  @xcite , that leads to their disruption in the first 10 - 30 myr , may prevent the formation of age gradients even if shocks trigger star formation .",
    "stellar winds and supernovae may drive out the gas not used in star formation , causing a change in the gravitational potential .",
    "this would lead to the disintegration of the clusters , as stars become unbound .",
    "coherent age gradients must first survive the `` infant mortality '' process ; then , after @xmath4 myr , the `` dissolution of stellar groups '' scenario proposed by  @xcite can also take place near spiral arms .",
    "these last process can explain the apparent `` downstream decline '' of the gradients already noticed by us  ( cf .",

    "[ omegavar ]    recently , based on the analysis with the radial tremaine - weinberg ( rtw ) method of co and hi data of several galaxies , it has been proposed that the spiral pattern speed @xmath5 may actually increase with decreasing radius in some objects  @xcite . according to  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ", this behavior is also seen in simulations",
    ". occurs only in simulations with flocculent , transient arms . ]",
    "if this is indeed the case , there would be no real long - lived pattern with solid body rotation , and hence no significant offsets between the tracers of the different stages of star formation would be expected ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , azimuthal color gradients across the arms would not be observed .    in  @xcite , we investigated the effect of having ( and neglecting ) non - circular streaming motions , that is , of using a purely circular dynamic model to derive spiral pattern speeds from observations of color gradients . summarizing , based on semi - analytical solutions and mhd simulations ,",
    "gas orbits were obtained for models with a fixed pattern speed .",
    "stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models of age gradients were incorporated to these gas orbits , and synthetic photometric observations were performed .",
    "the method of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gg96 ) was then applied to measure @xmath5 . in spite of having a real pattern speed , constant with radius",
    ", higher pattern speeds were measured at smaller radii ( see figure  [ noncircular ] ) . as mentioned in  @xcite ,",
    "the reason for this bias is that gas streamlines in a steady rotating spiral shock turn somewhat along the arm after passing through the shock .",
    "hence , stars take longer to move away from the arm , and the observer will think there is a smaller difference between the pattern speed and the orbital frequency .",
    "@xmath5 will seem to follow @xmath6 , just like in the previously mentioned applications of the radial rtw method , except that in our case we can be sure that the trend is caused by the streaming motions of the young stars , rather than by a radial variation of @xmath5 .",
    "the bias is also found in real observations , as shown in  @xcite .    in an ideal scenario where @xmath5 is indeed constant for all radii and spiral arms trigger star formation in all their extension , color gradients are predicted to be located all along the arms ( except near cr ) . in reality ,",
    "age gradients are detected only in a few small regions per galaxy , but they do seem linked to disk dynamics ( gg96 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , we have detected gradients through visual inspection . in order to locate gradients in a more objective way , and to attempt to identify some that do not meet the theoretical expectations of coherence or smoothness , in what follows",

    "conversely , there could be color gradients that are not linked to the dynamics of the disk .",
    "one speculative scenario is provided by the igimf ( the integrated galaxial igimf ) theory of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this theory is able to explain the h@xmath16 cutoff in galaxy disks without a corresponding cutoff in star formation ( as deduced from the non - ionizing far - ultraviolet flux given out by b - type stars ) .",
    "the igimf theory posits that maximum star cluster mass depends on gas surface density ( or , equivalently , on star formation rate ) , and that maximum stellar mass depends on cluster mass .",
    "if this is indeed the case , one could obtain a color gradient from coeval star clusters across a region with a gas surface density gradient .    at any rate , a statistical analysis , tied to spiral dynamics , of color gradients in several objects",
    "is necessary to identify the gradients that are linked to dws .",
    "this is even more important since by general rule gradients are painstakingly identified only in selected regions and not along entire arms .",
    "it is , however , important to stress that our new results imply that long - lived modes seem to have produced gradients that run for a sizeable part of a spiral arm in at least @xmath65 of the analyzed objects .",
    "this is , in itself , remarkable .",
    "for the rest of the objects ( ngc  578 , ngc  1703 , ngc  4603 , ngc  4939 , ngc  6907 , and ngc  6951 ) , the fourier methods failed to detect signs of gradients besides the ones that had already been identified by eye .",
    "it is interesting to point out , though , that ngc  4603 shows a multi - armed structure in the optical and nir bands , although it was kept in the sample because of its two - armed structure in the mass map . for ngc  6951 ( type sab in the rc3 ) and ngc  6907 ( type sb in the rc3 )",
    ", the cr radius may lie around @xmath66 .",
    "this is possibly an indication of color gradients within the bar region , as already found in  @xcite .",

    "these segments seem to have an irregular magnetic field , while the regions with a regular magnetic field harbor instead weak shocks , and chains of star complexes with a nearly regular spacing .",
    "strong shocks are associated with a larger pitch angle of the spiral segment .",
    "another prediction involving pitch angles in the dw theory paradigm comes from the local dispersion relation . at a fixed mass surface density ,",
    "the pitch angle increases proportionally to the square of the velocity dispersion  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that is , with the age of the stellar population and , hence , with image wavelength in the optical and nir .",
    "pitch angles were measured with fourier techniques  @xcite , in the radial range where the spiral perturbation seems more prominent ( see table  [ tbl - pitchs ] ) .",
    "this method assumes a logarithmic geometry for the spirals , although this might not be the case for all objects at all radii  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ histo_j_gri ] shows histograms of @xmath81 - @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the pitch angle and @xmath84 can be @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or `` mass '' , depending on the image where @xmath83 has been measured . were adopted for analysis . however , @xmath81 values were discarded if their sign does not agree with that of @xmath82 .",
    "( signs indicate whether the galaxy has an `` s '' or a `` z '' on - the - sky view . )",
    "the pitch angles measured for ngc  578 with the fourier method were also rejected , since their nominal sign is at odds with the observed on - the - sky view . ]",
    "negative values of the differences indicate that the pitch angle is larger in the nir than in the optical . in the histograms of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , there are indeed more objects with negative differences .",
    "the median values of each histogram are , respectively , -0.9@xmath14 , -1.1@xmath14 , and 0.0@xmath14 .",
    "this result is in agreement with  @xcite , who find tighter arms in bluer colors in images of four spirals , suggesting the presence of dws .",
    "interestingly , the median value of the @xmath88 histogram is 2.2@xmath14 , so that the mass arms are statistically more open than the arms in nir light .",
    "an inspection of the mass maps indicates that the spiral arms loci in the nir images do not always coincide with the location of the arms in the mass maps  ( see figures  [ j_vs_mass ] and  [ j_vs_mass_cont ] ) , a fact that can be explained by the contribution of young stars to the nir light .",
    "finally , we compare the median pitch angle distribution in those galaxies that we have classified as having radially extended azimuthal color gradients , against the distribution in the galaxies where we have detected localized gradients only .",
    "figure  [ histo_longlived ] displays the pitch angle histograms for each data set .",
    "the statistical significance is low , due to the small number of objects , but the objects with signs of widespread color gradients may have more open spiral arms ( larger pitch angles ) .    crrrrrrc    ngc  578 & ( 20.3 - 63.8 ) & -34.70 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -35.72 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -37.92 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -41.68 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -49.45 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 40.97 + ngc  918 & ( 18.6 - 57.2 ) & 20.60 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 21.77 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 22.63 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 23.54 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 29.42 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 22.20 + ngc  1417 & ( 20.0 - 60.0 ) & 36.82 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 33.76 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 36.82 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 41.71 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 39.13 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 36.82 + ngc  1421 & ( 34.4 - 91.6 ) & 36.17 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 37.17 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 38.21 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 39.31 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -81.66 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 37.69 + ngc  1703 & ( 12.4 - 27.5 ) & 16.55 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 16.29 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 15.79 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -36.16 ( @xmath89=1 ) & -55.62 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 16.04 + ngc  3001 & ( 19.2 - 44.0 ) & 31.55 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 31.55 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 32.45 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 32.45 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 34.40 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 32.00 + ngc  3338 & ( 45.0 - 145.0 ) & -13.43 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -13.60 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -13.77 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -13.77 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 83.87 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -13.68 + ngc  4254 & ( 30.0 - 157.5 ) & -29.30 ( @xmath89=3 ) & 18.13 ( @xmath89=1 ) & -29.30 ( @xmath89=3 ) & -29.30 ( @xmath89=3 ) & 22.62 ( @xmath89=1 ) & -29.30 + ngc  4603 & ( 13.8 - 45.4 ) & 25.61 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 26.87 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 27.54 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 28.25 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 30.59 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 27.20 + ngc  4939 & ( 50.0 - 145.0 ) & 10.96 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 11.07 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 11.07 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 10.74 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 29.89 ( @xmath89=3 ) & 11.02 + ngc  6907 & ( 34.8 - 55.1 ) & 24.89 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 24.34 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 27.34 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 27.34 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 45.15 ( @xmath89=2 ) & 26.12 + ngc  6951 & ( 45.0 - 105.0 ) & -31.48 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -33.26 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -32.35 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -34.23 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -36.30 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -32.80 + ngc  7125 & ( 20.3 - 95.7 ) & -23.88 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -26.76 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -35.99 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -40.84 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -52.36 ( @xmath89=2 ) & -31.38 +",
    "[ conclusions ]    from a fourier analysis of 13 objects , with a spiral arm structure that can be likely explained by dw theory , we find that @xmath90 of them show evidence of color gradients that run for at least a range of radii . for the remaining objects ,",
    "the evidence of extended gradients is insufficient .",
    "this notwithstanding , our previous studies  @xcite suggest that azimuthal age / color gradients ( or candidates ) can be found for most galaxies , at least in some regions of the spiral arms .",
    "a relation of such very localized gradients with the dynamics of the disk has been previously established by the comparison with an mhd simulation with a constant pattern speed at all radii  @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with other observational studies of age patterns ( or offsets ) across spiral arms  @xcite . by means of an h@xmath16 to far - uv flux ratio method ,  @xcite found age gradients across the spiral arms of the grand - design spirals m74 and m100 ( ngc  628 and ngc  4321 , respectively ) .",
    "likewise , the `` breaks '' in the radial metallicity distribution found near cr in a sample of @xmath63 20 galaxies by  @xcite and  @xcite imply that spiral arms must be long - lived structures .",
    "a dominant pattern speed must exist with a unique cr radius , or otherwise any discontinuities in the radial metallicity profiles would be smoothed out  @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other works , however  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have found a lack of a persistent pattern , and instead recurrent short - lived transient spirals only .    any model that intends to explain spiral structure has to avoid the winding dilemma , that ultimately led to the idea of stationary dws with a fixed pattern speed for all radii .",
    "for this same reason , the observational results of  @xcite and  @xcite for some objects , where @xmath91 decreases with radius , imply the existence of transient spiral modes that emerge and disappear at different stages in the disk evolution .",
    "such transient arms can not produce stellar age / color gradients , though .    a theory that reconciles the existence of age / color gradients with a radially varying pattern speed is still missing .",
    "however , as argued in section  [ omegavar ] , the observation of a pattern speed that varies with radius may be an artifact produced by the non - circular streaming motions of the stars newly born in shocked material .",
    "this effect can explain the coexistence of azimuthal age / color gradients across spiral arms , and of a spiral pattern speed @xmath5 that seems to vary with radius in the same way as the orbital frequency @xmath6 .",
