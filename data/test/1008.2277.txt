    "this paper deals with chain graphs under the classic lauritzen - wermuth - frydenberg interpretation . we prove that the regular gaussian distributions that factorize with respect to a chain graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 parameters have positive lebesgue measure with respect to @xmath2 , whereas those that factorize with respect to @xmath0 but are not faithful to it have zero lebesgue measure with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this means that , in the measure - theoretic sense described , almost all the regular gaussian distributions that factorize with respect to @xmath0 are faithful to it .",
    "previously , it has been proven that for any undirected graph there exists a regular gaussian distribution that is faithful to it ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3 ) .",
    "a stronger result has been proven for acyclic directed graphs : in certain measure - theoretic sense , almost all the regular gaussian distributions that factorize with respect to an acyclic directed graph are faithful to it ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "therefore , this paper extends the latter result to chain graphs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have recently proved in @xcite a result analogous to the one in this paper but for strictly positive discrete probability distributions with arbitrary prescribed sample space .",
    "it is also worth noticing that a result analogous to the one in this paper has been proven in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) under the alternative andersson - madigan - perlman interpretation of chain graphs .",
    "there are two important implications of the result proven in this paper :    * the use of chain graphs to represent independence models in artificial intelligence and statistics has increased over the years , particularly in the case of undirected graphs and acyclic directed graphs .",
    "however , there are independence models that can be represented exactly by chain graphs but that can not be represented exactly by undirected graphs or acyclic directed graphs . as a matter of fact , the experimental results in @xcite suggest that this may be the case for the vast majority of independence models that can be represented exactly by chain graphs . in other words , for most chain graphs , every undirected graph and acyclic directed graph either represents some separation statement that is not represented by the chain graph or does not represent some separation statement that is represented by the chain graph . as (",
    "* section 1.1 ) points out , something that would confirm that this is an advantage of chain graphs for modeling regular gaussian distributions would be proving that any independence model represented by a chain graph can be represented by a regular gaussian distribution .",
    "the result in this paper confirms this point .",
    "* in the literature , there exist two graphical criteria for identifying independencies holding in a probability distribution @xmath3 that factorizes with respect to a chain graph @xmath0 : the moralization criterion @xcite and the c - separation criterion @xcite .",
    "both criteria are known to be equivalent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.1 ) . furthermore",
    ", both criteria are known to be sound , i.e. they only identify independencies in @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 3.34 and 3.36 ) .",
    "the result in this paper implies that both criteria are also complete for regular gaussian distributions : if @xmath3 is a regular gaussian distribution , then both criteria identify all the independencies in @xmath3 that can be identified on the sole basis of @xmath0 , because there exists a regular gaussian distribution that is faithful to @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing some concepts in section [ sec : preliminaries ] . in section",
    "[ sec : cg ] , we describe how we parameterize the regular gaussian distributions that factorize with respect to a chain graph .",
    "we present our results on faithfulness in section [ sec : faithfulness ] . in section [ sec : equivalence ] , we present some results about chain graph equivalence that follow from the results in section [ sec : faithfulness ] .",
    "finally , we close with some discussion in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we define some concepts used later in this paper .",
    "we first recall some definitions from probabilistic graphical models .",
