    "the subject of one - atom maser and its optical counterpart , the one - atom laser , has generated extensive interest after the recent experimental demonstrationa that they are capable of generating nonclassical states of the radiation fields [ 1 - 3 ] . in the one - atom maser experiment [ 1 ] , two - level @xmath0 atoms in their upper rydberg states of the transitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pumped into a microwave cavity at such a rate that , at most , one atom is present there at any time .",
    "so , there can be one of the two situations in the cavity : only one atom is present in the cavity or the cavity is empty of any atom . the cavity is tuned to one of the above two transitions in individual experiments and the sub - poissonian nature of the cavity radiation field having variance less than that for a coherent state field has been inferred .",
    "it may be noted here that a well stabilized conventional laser can generate radiation fields that can at best be close to a coherent state field only .",
    "sub - poissonian radiation fields have photon distribution functions narrower than that for a coherent state field which has a poissonian photon statistics .",
    "whereas in the one - atom laser experiment [ 2 ] , the pump rate of two - level @xmath3 atoms in their upper states into a resonant optical cavity gives a stream of an average number of atoms present there satisfying the condition @xmath4 .",
    "however , in order to have a sub - poissonian radiation field , an uniform atom - field interaction independent of cavity mode strucure is essential .",
    "the technique adopted by an el al [ 3 ] to improve their earlier setup [ 2 ] provides such a situation .",
    "single - atom events in this cavity would be suitable for generating sub - poissonian field in the optical regime since such arrangements in the microwave regime produced nonclassical fields [ 1 ] .    in the following ,",
    "we describe a unified formalism which shows that the one - atom maser ( micromaser ) as well as the one - atom laser ( microlaser ) cavity fields can have sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "our unified theory also explains the conventional laser dynamics .",
    "further , the hope is that such sub - possonian radiation fields would further shrink to bosonic fock states .",
    "our analysis below shows that this unified theory is not suitable for looking into these possibilities .",
    "hence , we examine the possibilities of generating fock states of the micromaser cavity field by an exact numerical simulation of the dynamics . in the case of microlaser ,",
    "the damping of the atomic levels precludes such possibilities .",
    "we assume that atoms arrive individually at the cavity with an average interval @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the flux rate of atoms .",
    "we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interaction time , fixed for every atom , and @xmath9 is the random time lapse between one atom leaving and successive atom entering the cavity .",
    "@xmath10 is the average of @xmath11 taken over a poissonian distribution in time of incoming atoms .",
    "the cavity field evolves by this repititive dynamics from near vacuum as thermal photons in the optical cavity are almost nonexitent .",
    "thus , during @xmath8 , we have to solve the equation of motion by taking into account the cavity dissipation as well as atomic damping , important at optical frequencies .",
    "thus , we have @xmath12-\\kappa ( a^{\\dagger}a\\rho -2a\\rho a^{\\dagger}+ \\rho",
    "a^{\\dagger}a ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\gamma ( s^+ s^- \\rho -2s^- \\rho",
    "s^+ + \\rho s^+ s^-)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian [ 6 ] and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the cavity - mode and atomic decay constants respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the photon annihilation operator and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pauli pseudo - spin operators for the two - level system . during @xmath9 ,",
    "the cavity field evolves under its own dynamics and is represented by @xmath19 the method for obtaining a coarse - grained time derivative for the photon number distribution @xmath20 is given in detail in ref . [ 4 ] .",
    "the steady - state photon statistics is then @xmath21 and @xmath22 is obtained from the normalisation @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 is given by a continued fractions invoving the system parameters @xmath25 , the number of atoms passing through the cavity in a photon lifetime , @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "once @xmath29 is obtained , we can get the laser intensity , proportional to @xmath30 , and its variance . *",
    "this represents micromaser or microlaser photon statistics depending upon the relative values of the dissipative parameters and the coupling constatnt .",
    "* we introduce another paprameter , the pump parameter @xmath31 useful for the description of laser characteristics .",
    "it is interesting to note that we can recover the conventional laser photon statistics from eq .",
    "( 2 ) by an appropriate choice of the above parameters .",
    "this involves the rydberg levels of the active atoms having spontaneous lifetime @xmath32 in the order of a fraction of a second . whereas their flight time @xmath8 through the cavity is of the order of microseconds .",
    "hence we can safely put @xmath33 in the eq .",
    "we find from our formalism that the normalized variance defined by @xmath34 is @xmath35 which is very close to the experimental finding @xmath36 in ref .",
    "1a near @xmath37 and values of the other parameters reported there .",
    "thus we find that our formalism describes the micromaser dynamics quite accurately .",
    "it may be noted here that @xmath38 for coherent state radiation fields .",
    "thus , this novel device does generate radiation fields with sub - poissoinian photon statistics .",
    "the lasing frequency here is in optical regime and , hence , the atomic lifetimes in these cases are short .",
    "hence , we have to take @xmath39 for the microlaser dynamics . for the typical parameters in the experiments in ref . 3",
    ", we find that @xmath40 . from our photon statitics in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain the laser intensity proportional to @xmath30 as a function of the pump parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the structures in @xmath30 as @xmath41 is varied for fixed @xmath42 reflect the characteristics of the jaynes - cummings interaction[6 ] .",
    "soon after the threshold is attained at about @xmath43 , the photon number rises sharply .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the field is almost in vacuum before the very first atom enters the cavity .",
    "thus the atoms initially in their upper states contribute varying fractions of their energies to the cavity and at @xmath44 and @xmath45 the atoms get completely inverted .",
    "thus @xmath30 is peaked at about @xmath46 depending on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath42 . for higher @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the peak moves slightly towards higher @xmath41 due to threshold being attained at higher @xmath41 .",
    "we further find that @xmath47 around @xmath4831.4 , 62.8 , 94.2 , .... giving @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , .... respectively . at such values of @xmath52 ,",
    "the atom absorbs the photon it has emitted before leaving the cavity . + the variance of the cavity field @xmath53 increases sharply at about @xmath46 where @xmath30 is also peaked .",
    "we find that near this value of @xmath41 , the @xmath29 is doubly peaked at @xmath54 and @xmath55 and this increases the variance in photon number .",
    "however , for slightly higher value of @xmath41 , the cavity field is highly sub - poissonian in nature .",
    "it also appears for further higher values of @xmath41 .",
    "but , @xmath30 is very small for such values of @xmath41 due to increase in the interaction time @xmath56 which increases the infuence of atomic as well as cavity reservoirs on the atom - field interaction .",
    "it may be noted here that these characteristics are clearly different from that of conventional lasers .",
    "we see that the one - atom dynamics is capable of narrowing the photon distribution function of the cavity radiation field compared to that for a coherent state field .",
    "this raises the question whether the distribution can be further reduced to a number state of the radiation field .",
    "the reason why such possibilities may arise is due to the fact that the reservoir influences are minimal in these dynamics .",
    "in fact , the analysis in ref . [ 4 ] indicates this possibility in the micromaser dynamics when the condition @xmath57\\tau~=~0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is satisfied .",
    "clearly @xmath58 only when @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the later condition can be met by an adjustment of the atomic velocity with the help of the velocity selector in the micromaser setup [ 1 ] .",
    "but the other condition that the cavity temperature @xmath61 obviously can not be satisfied . in the micromaser experiment [ 1b ] , the quality factore of the cavity is @xmath62 and its temperature is maintained at @xmath63 which gives thermal photons @xmath64 .",
    "the rydberg level involved in the atomic transitions have lifetimes of the order of a second which is much longer compared to its flight time of about @xmath65 through the cavity .",
    "these values of the parameters governing the dissipation dynamics make their influences very small . in the case of one - atom laser ,",
    "the lifetimes of atomic levels at optical frequencies are short which makes the influence of atomic reservoir non - negligible . hence , even though the thermal photons @xmath66 in the optical cavity , the one - atom laser [ 2,3 ] would not be a right choice for this study .",
    "thus , the micromaser turns out to be a suitable system to look into the possibilities of generating a number state of the cavity radiation field . +   +",
    "we then have to take into account the exact infuences of the reservoirs to acertain if a fock state of the cavity field can actually be generated .",
    "hence , instead of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we have to deal with + @xmath12-\\kappa(1+\\bar n_{th } ) ( a^{\\dagger}a\\rho -2a\\rho a^{\\dagger}+ \\rho a^{\\dagger}a ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\kappa \\bar n_{th } ( aa^{\\dagger}\\rho -2a^{\\dagger}\\rho a + \\rho aa^{\\dagger})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whenever a atom is present in the cavity .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a atom takes a time @xmath8 to pass through the cavity .",
    "these atomic events are seperated by random durations , @xmath9 , during which the cavity evolves under its own dynamics .",
    "hence we set @xmath67 during @xmath9 .",
    "processes like these stomic events seperated by random intervals are known as poisson processes in literature encountered in various branches of physics , for example , radioactive materials emitting alpha particles .",
    "a sequence of durations of such processes can be obtained from uniform deviates , also called random numbers , @xmath68 generated using a computer such that @xmath69 , and then by using the relation [ 7 ] @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 where @xmath6 is the flux rate of atoms .",
    "+ we have carried out numerical simulation of the dynamics with the data taken from the experimental arrangements [ 1 ] in which @xmath73 and the @xmath74 was one of the atom - field interaction times . in this case",
    "@xmath75 which produces fock states of n photons where n satisfies @xmath76 in an ideal cavity @xmath77 . since the experimantal arrangements are close to ideal situation , it was hoped that such fock states could be attained experimentally . indeed , such results have been reported in ref .",
    "however , our numerical simulations does not confirm these conclusions .",
    "instead , it gives photon fields with very narrow distribution functions ( sub - poissoninan ) centred about n. figs . 1 and 2 display distribution function @xmath78 narrowly centred about @xmath79 .",
    "+    the reason for these results is simple . the cavity dissipation ,",
    "although very small , effects the coherent atoim - field interaction and moreover the randomness in @xmath9 makes the photon distribution function fluctuate all the time centred about n in addition to making it broader .",
    "+ in this experiment [ 1 ] , the atoms coming out of the cavity are subjected to measuments from which state of the cavity field is inferred .",
    "the atoms enter the cavity in the upper @xmath80 of the two states @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the exiting atom is , in general , in a state @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the probabilities of the atom being in the states @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics [ 8 ] , this wave function _ collapses _ ( or is projected ) to either @xmath80 or @xmath81 the moment a measurement is made on it . due to this inherent nature of quantum mechanics , a noise is associated with the measurement which is know as _ quantum projection noise _ [ 9 ] .",
    "we define the projection operator @xmath85 .",
    "the variance in its measurement is given by @xmath86 we find that @xmath87 only when @xmath88 . for the generation of a fock state ,",
    "it is necessary that the atom should leave the cavity unchanged in its upper state [ 4 ] .",
    "hence , for such a situation we must have @xmath89 in which case @xmath90 should be 0 .",
    "we find from our numerical simulations that that @xmath91 is mostly about 0.8 [ fig . 3 ] and ,",
    "hence , @xmath92 always .",
    "this obviously indicates that the cavity field is in a linear superposition of fock states giving a photon distribution function with the variance , defined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath93 ( for a fock state @xmath94 ) .",
    "indeed , we find that the @xmath53 is about @xmath95 in our calculations , presented in fig .",
    "4 , indicating a sub - poissonian nature of the cavity field . by itself , it carries a signature of quantum mechanics . +        the steady - state photon statistics in eq .",
    "( 2 ) gives @xmath97 which lies within the range of fluctuations in fig .",
    "4 . this is due to the fact that the coarse - graining process involved in obtaining steady - state results neglects these small fluctuations ( a detailed discussion can be found in ref . [ 5 ] ) . our exact numerical simulations , however , shows that they are crucial in the generation of a fock state .",
    "we have carried out simulation until about 10000 atoms passed through the cavity and carrying out the simulations any further would only be a repitition of the above fluctuations .",
