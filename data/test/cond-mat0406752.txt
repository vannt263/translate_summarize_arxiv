    "natural processes often lead to spatially non - uniform distributions of physical quantities .",
    "in particular scale - free structures are intriguing because they suggest dynamic principles that are universally applicable @xcite .",
    "recently it has been realized that many complex networks exhibit scale - free topologies @xcite . in general , the first theoretical framework for such very skew distributions was the simon model @xcite , featuring a `` rich get richer '' process , that recently has been developed into _ preferential attachment _ to explain scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "another approach to such broad distributions is the self organized critical models that were put forward by per bak and coworkers @xcite and were suggested for networks by @xcite . in these models",
    "large - scale structures and intermittent activity emerge as a consequence of small - scale excitations of systems with inherent memory . in the present paper we elaborate on another class of self - organization models , based on the  aggregation with injection ",
    "scenario @xcite . interpreted as a merging - and - creation process , reviewing @xcite",
    ", we apply this class to complex networks and show that scale - free topologies emerge .",
    "the merging - and - creation process spontaneously generates power - law distributions by a mechanism which is quite different from the  rich get richer \" scenario . as in the soc models it is based on a non - equilibrium bottom up scenario , where a scale - free distribution of structures is obtained at _ steady state_. thus it indeed is an appealing alternative to the preferential attachment models that has been suggested for _ growing _ networks .",
    "the basic  merging - and - creation \" process can be described in terms of the evolution of a system of many elements @xmath0 , each characterized by a scalar @xmath1 .",
    "the scalar may be either just positive  @xcite or both positive and negative  @xcite .     at different times from the start",
    "averaged over @xmath2-realizations for a system with @xmath3 elements .",
    "the dashed curve is the exact solution that scales as @xmath4 with @xmath5 for large @xmath6 .",
    "the numerical simulations are for three different times and agree with the scaling up to some cutoff .",
    "the deviation from the power - law above the cutoff reflects that , in addition , there is a single growing , large element , @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the total sum @xmath9 of all the other @xmath10 approaches a constant steady state value .",
    "* d ) * refers to symmetric process where both positive and negative elements can be merged ( as the combined a ) and b ) ) .",
    "the steady state distribution @xmath11 , obtained numerically , is shown for three sizes @xmath12 .",
    "the exact asymptotic solution is given by the dashed line ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "_ , height=226 ]    as a concrete example one may think of the elements as particles and the scalar as the mass of a particle .",
    "other examples are nodes of a network and the number of links attached to a node ; companies and the financial assets of the company ; vortices and the vorticity of a vortex and so forth .",
    "the prototype of the process describes a situation in which the elements in the system redistribute their corresponding @xmath1 according to a merging step where two elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen ( typically randomly ) and then are merged together . for illustration",
    "see fig .",
    "[ algnum]ab .",
    "the merged element acquires the sum of the scalars @xmath16 .",
    "we express this as @xmath17 where the second process means that the element @xmath14 is replaced by an empty element .",
    "this ensures that the number of elements remain constant . in parallel to this",
    ", there is a creation process of elements with small @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to adding a scalar @xmath19 to an empty element : @xmath20 we either ensure that the average @xmath6 of the system does not change by choosing @xmath21 or @xmath22 with equal probability in the creation step ( see fig .",
    "[ algnum]ab ) or we consider the case when the average @xmath6 is growing by choosing @xmath21 every time ( see fig .",
    "[ algnum]a ) .",
    "obviously there is a multitude of variants to this process , including for example the case where the creation event is also allowed on @xmath23 elements .",
    "these variations of the merging - and - creation processes can be classified into three categories , each characterized by a unique power - law exponent for the distribution of scalars @xmath6 among the elements .",
    "* * category @xmath5 * + the prototype process @xcite can be described as @xmath24 here we imagine that we have a large number of elements @xmath12 and start the process from all @xmath25 . at each step the average scalar @xmath26",
    "is increased by @xmath27 .",
    "[ algnum]a illustrates the basic process and fig .",
    "[ algnum]c shows the result from simulations using this initial condition ( averaged over many realizations ) .",
    "as seen the probability distribution that an element has a value @xmath6 , @xmath28 , is a power - law with a slope that to good approximation is given by @xmath5 i.e. @xmath29 apart from a single growing large @xmath6-element .",
    "thus the growth of the average only results in the growth of a single largest element .",
    "the rest of the distribution is stationary and furthermore this stationary solution is independent of the starting condition . + in terms of the probability distribution @xmath30 the condition for a stationary solution in the limit of large @xmath12",
    "is given by @xmath31 which for @xmath32 gives @xmath33 and provides a recursive solution for subsequent @xmath6 s .",
    "as a result @xcite one obtains a steady state distribution with asymptotic behavior @xmath29 . * * category @xmath34 * + this corresponds to the symmetric case were @xmath35 .",
    "the prototype for this process @xcite is the same as for the previous case except for a symmetric creation : @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ algnum]b ) .",
    "this means that the average @xmath37 now is unchanged during the process .",
    "again we start with @xmath12 empty elements ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "[ algnum]d shows the result from simulations .",
    "a power - law distribution with @xmath34 is generated to good approximation .",
    "+ the steady state solution in terms of @xmath28 is this time given by @xmath39=0.\\ ] ] which has the asymptotic solution @xmath40 as demonstrated by takaysu in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , the robustness of this scaling behavior is remarkable : if one instead of starting from a symmetric distribution with average @xmath41 , starts from a situation with an excess average @xmath42 then all the excess ( @xmath43 ) will be collected on a single large element @xcite .",
    "this is similar to what was found for the growing case with @xmath44 .",
    "* * category @xmath45 * + here we consider the process of merging and spontaneous fluctuations among positive elements",
    ". thus no negative elements are allowed , but in contrast to the @xmath5 case the average @xmath26 is not growing .",
    "this is achieved if at every merging step there is some small loss , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] is a random number from a narrow distribution @xmath48 and @xmath6 is constrained to be @xmath49 .",
    "the process in general corresponds to merging of positive elements , but also allows for spontaneous",
    " evaporation ",
    "( when one @xmath6-value is zero ) .",
    "this process is in fact also equivalent to a number of other conserving processes ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) subject to the size constraint that all @xmath6 should be larger than some @xmath52 .",
    "+ it deals with situations where also the largest element can sometimes lose in the merging step , under the constraint of a lowest allowed value of @xmath6 .",
    "+ with the transformation @xmath53 the model is equivalent to the process @xmath54 this is mathematically equivalent to the symmetric process with @xmath34 with the additional constraint that no element can have a scalar less than @xmath55 .",
    "any random choice of two elements which would lead to a merged element violating the constraint is abandoned and a new random choice is made .",
    "one notices that because the creation is symmetric with respect to @xmath56 the average value @xmath26 is preserved ( @xmath41 when starting from a symmetric distribution ) .",
    "[ case3]a gives the result from a numerical simulation .",
    "the data falls on the straight line corresponding to a power - law distribution with @xmath57 .",
    "+ + the steady state solution in terms of @xmath28 is obtained is obtained in the same way as in the previous cases but the constraint changes the steady state condition into @xmath58}{2 } \\ ; = \\ ; 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation has a simple recursive solution since the @xmath55 and 0 cases directly give @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ pcase3 ] ) leads to an equation in terms of @xmath60 given by @xmath61 which has the solution @xmath62 expanding the argument of the square root in @xmath63 gives @xmath64 now the zero order moment is just @xmath65 as it must .",
    "the second order moment must vanish by the condition @xmath66 : if @xmath67 is negative then there is no solution and if it is positive then the first moment @xmath68 .",
    "so the only possibility is @xmath69 which also means that the leading @xmath63-dependence of the square root in eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "this in turn means that in this case the second moment diverges as @xmath71 and it follows that the leading behavior of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "+ the exact solution can be obtained from the recursive relation starting with @xmath69 and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ case3]a and its inset .",
    "[ case3]b shows the cross - over from the case with @xmath57 to the completely symmetric case with @xmath34 , by successively relaxing the constraint from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "let us now discuss the merging - and - creation process in the context of evolving networks .",
    "the motivation for such a process in these types of complex systems is the gain in `` simplification '' that one obtains by merging nodes , supplemented by an overall drive to invent or excite the system by new nodes with new connections .",
    "the merging - and - creation scenario for networks were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown numerically that also for networks the merging - and - creation gives rise to power - law distributions in parallel with the scalar version discussed in the present version .",
    "a simple network version goes as follows :    * choose two nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 randomly .",
    "the corresponding scalar is the degree of the node ( the number of links attached to a node ) . *",
    "the nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are merged together to a node @xmath77 of degree @xmath78 results , with @xmath79 being the number of nodes that are neighbors to both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these common links are deleted from the network ( if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are joined by a link this is also counted as a common link ) . thereby multiple links between pairs of nodes are removed . * a new node of degree @xmath80",
    "is added to the network with the links attached to @xmath80 random nodes .",
    "the degree @xmath80 of the added node is a random number picked from a uniform distribution centered around some number @xmath81 .",
    "[ undirnet]a shows that this network version of merging - and - creation gives rise to a power - law distribution with @xmath5 ( for any @xmath82 ) as expected for this process applied to positive quantities",
    ".    however , a real network implementation of merging - and - creation would rather consists of local topological rearrangements which facilitate performance .",
    "thus we consider the case where one node is constrained to be the random neighbor of the other in the merging process @xcite .",
    "this would be reasonable in molecular networks where one protein takes over the regulatory functions of a neighboring protein in order to shorten the signaling pathways . with this simple constraint on the merging - and - creation process the power - law exponent @xmath72",
    "becomes a function of @xmath81 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ undirnet]b , where @xmath72 varies from @xmath83 to @xmath84 with increasing @xmath81 .",
    "another interesting network application is related to merging of sun spots and associated magnetic field lines in the solar atmosphere @xcite . in this case",
    "there are sun - spots of two polarities , and the network consists of magnetic field lines that make directed connections between the sun spots . in this case the sign ( polarity ) would correspond to the number of in- or out - edges @xcite .",
    "each vertex may have different number of edges , but at any time a given vertex can not be both donor and acceptor .",
    "further , in the direct generalization of the symmetric @xmath34 case , we allow several parallel edges between any pair of vertices . at each time - step two vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen randomly .",
    "the basic update is shown in panel a ) , b ) of fig .",
    "[ dirnet ] , and the result in terms of number of edges from any node counting multiple edges is shown in fig .",
    "[ dirnet]c . also interesting in this case is the activity of events of sun spot assimilations , exhibiting a scaling @xmath85 also found in the more detailed model of cascading magnetic loops in solar atmosphere by hughes and paczuski @xcite ."
