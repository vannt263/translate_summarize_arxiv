    "a comprehension of the link between stochastic processes and quantum mechanics can provide a better understanding of the role of space  time at a quantum gravity level . indeed , noncommutative geometry , in the way connes , chamseddine and mukhanov provided recently @xcite , seems to fit well the view that a quantized volume yields a link at a deeper level of the connection between stochastic processes and quantum mechanics .",
    "this is an important motivation as we could start from a reformulation of quantum mechanics to support or drop proposals to understand quantum gravity and the fabric of space - time .    a deep connection exists between brownian motion and binomial coefficients .",
    "this can be established by recovering the kernel of the heat equation from the binomial distribution for a random walk ( pascal  tartaglia triangle ) and applying the theorem of central limit @xcite . when an even smaller step in the random walk is taken a wiener process",
    "is finally approached .",
    "so , it is a natural question to ask what would be the analogous of pascal  tartaglia triangle in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "this arises naturally by noting the apparent formal similarity between the heat equation and the schrdinger equation .",
    "but this formal analogy is somewhat difficult to understand due to the factor @xmath0 entering into the schrdinger equation .",
    "an answer to this question hinges on a deep problem not answered yet : is there a connection between quantum mechanics and stochastic processes ?",
    "the formal similarity has prompted attempts to answer as in the pioneering work of edward nelson @xcite and in the subsequent deep analysis by francesco guerra and his group @xcite .",
    "they dubbed this reformulation of quantum mechanics as `` stochastic mechanics '' .",
    "this approach matches directly a wiener process to the schrdinger equation passing through a bohm - like set of hydrodynamic equations and so , it recovers all the drawbacks of bohm formulation .",
    "this view met severe criticisms motivating some researchers to a substantial claim that `` no classical stochastic process underlies quantum mechanics '' @xcite showing contradiction with predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "subsequent attempts to partially or fully recover this view were proposed with non - markovian processes @xcite or repeated measurements @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that a new set of stochastic processes can be devised that can elucidate such a connection @xcite .",
    "we show their existence @xcite and we will determine how spin is needed also in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "dirac equation for a free particle is also obtained .",
    "these processes are characterized by the presence of a bernoulli process yielding the values @xmath1 and @xmath0 , exactly as expected in the volume quantization in noncommutative geometry . in this latter case",
    ", it appears that a stochastic process on a quantized manifold is well represented by a fractional power of an ordinary wiener process when this is properly defined through a technique at discrete time .",
    "for our aims we will use the simplest one : the euler  maruyama technique . a numerical test will yield the proof of existence for this class of stochastic processes .",
    "also , the kernel of the schrdinger equation is numerically obtained through an ordinary brownian motion .",
    "the paper is so strctured . in sec .",
    "[ sec2_0 ] we discuss noncommutative geometry in informal way , providing a general formula for a stochastic process on a quantized riemannian manifold . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the fractional powers of a wiener process and we solve the corresponding stochastic equation recovering the wiener process we started from after squaring its square root . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we derive the formula for the square root of a wiener process expressing it through more elementary processes : this shows the need for a clifford algebra and the fokker ",
    "planck equation is obtained for a free particle . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we show numerically how the kernel of the schrdinger equation is recovered by an ordinary brownian motion just with the extraction of its square root . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we derive the fokker  planck equation in presence of a potential and specialize to the case of a harmonic oscillator . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we show how to recover a stochastic process on a noncommutative geometry taking the square root of more wiener processes and using the algebra of the dirac matrices . in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] , we recover the dirac equation as the fokker  planck equation for a square root process . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] conclusions are presented .",
    "common wisdom on geometry implies that one has to cope with points and minimum paths between them .",
    "indeed , the idea of geometry can be extended without the central concept of points but rather functions and introducing a redefinition of the concept of distance beside the well - known one from a riemannian geometry .",
    "this reformulation is due to alain connes @xcite .",
    "essentially , one introduces a triple composed by an algebra of functions @xmath2 with an involution operator like complex conjugation , playing the role of coordinates , a hilbert space @xmath3 , that we take the space of the square - summable spinors , and a dirac operator @xmath4 , being @xmath5 a spin connection , representing momenta .",
    "the algebra of functions has support on a riemann manifold .",
    "when we change the algebra of functions with a noncommutative algebra of operators acting on the given hilbert space , in the same way one quantize a classical theory , one gets a noncommutative geometry .",
    "so , a geometry is identified by the triple ( @xmath2,@xmath3,d ) .",
    "a function @xmath6 belonging to @xmath2 should satisfy the lipschitz condition on the riemann manifold given by @xmath7 provided the constant @xmath8 exists and @xmath9{\\ } { \\rm inf}\\left(\\int_\\gamma ds\\right)\\ ] ] is the usual ( geodesic ) distance on a riemann manifold that coincides with the well - known variational principle of minimum distance between two points .",
    "this grants some regularity properties of the functions in @xmath2 and their gradient that is bounded . in this way",
    ", we can introduce a new definition of distance dependent just on the algebra of functions @xmath2 and the dirac operator .",
    "this is given by @xmath10{\\ } { \\rm sup}(|f(x)-f(y)| : f\\in{\\cal a},\\lvert df\\rvert<1)\\ ] ] where the condition on the dirac operator plays a crucial role . in this way",
    ", one recovers the ordinary riemann distance between points @xcite .",
    "indeed , one has for a spinor @xmath11 @xmath12\\psi = i\\gamma\\cdot\\partial f\\psi.\\ ] ] then we need @xmath13\\rvert=\\lvert\\sqrt{\\partial_\\mu f\\partial^\\mu f}\\rvert\\le 1.\\ ] ] this is nothing else than asking the boundedness of the gradient of @xmath6 . we know that @xmath6 is lipshitz on the manifold and so",
    ", we can apply the cauchy mean value theorem implying that @xmath14\\rvert\\le\\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{d_r(x , y)}\\ ] ] because a constant @xmath8 exists that can limit the derivatives on the manifold .",
    "now , this implies , due to the condition @xmath15 , that @xmath16 and this means that @xmath17 is the upper extreme as required by our definition of distance .",
    "the main conclusion is that the dirac operator plays the role of the inverse of the distance @xmath18 .",
    "a noncommutative geometry implies that the volume is quantized with two classes of unity of volume @xmath19 .",
    "this has been recently proved by connes , chamseddine and mukhanov@xcite .",
    "the two classes of volume arise from the fact that the dirac operator should not be limited to majorana states in the hilbert space and so , we need to associate a charge conjugation operator @xmath20 to our triple @xmath21 . to complete our characterization of our geometry , we recall that the algebra of dirac matrices implies a @xmath22 , the chirality matrix . for an ordinary riemann manifold ,",
    "the algebra @xmath2 is that of functions and is commuting . remembering that @xmath23=i\\gamma\\cdot\\partial a$ ] , and noting that , in four dimensions , @xmath24 are legal functions of @xmath25 , it is @xmath26[d , x_2][d , x_3][d , x_4]=\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3\\gamma^4=-i\\gamma^5 $ ] . for generally chosen functions in @xmath25 , @xmath27 , summing over all the possible permutations",
    "one has a jacobian , we can define the chirality operator @xmath28\\ldots[d , a_d]).\\ ] ] so , in four dimension this gives @xmath29 being @xmath20 the jacobian , @xmath30 the vierbein for the riemann manifold and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , a well - known result .",
    "we used the fact that @xmath33 , being @xmath34 the metric tensor .",
    "so , the definition of the chirality operator is proportional to the factor determining the volume of a riemannian orientable manifold .    in order to see if a riemannian manifold can be properly quantized , instead of functions we consider operators @xmath35 belonging to an operator algebra @xmath36 .",
    "these operators have the properties @xmath37 this is a set of compact operators playing the role of coordinates as in the heisenberg commutation relations .",
    "we have to consider two sets of them @xmath38 and @xmath39 as we expect a conjugation of charge operator @xmath40 to exist such that @xmath41 for a given operator or complex conjugation for a function .",
    "this appears naturally out of a dirac algebra of gamma matrices .",
    "so , a natural way to write down the operators @xmath35 is by using an algebra of dirac matrices @xmath42 such that @xmath43 with @xmath44 , then @xmath45 we will have two different set of gamma matrices for @xmath38 and @xmath39 that will have independent traces . using the charge conjugation operator @xmath40",
    ", we can define a new coordinate @xmath46 where @xmath47 will project one or the other coordinate .",
    "we recognize that the spectrum of @xmath48 is in @xmath19 given eq.([eq : y ] ) . now",
    ", we generalize our equation for the chirality operator imposing a trace on @xmath49s both for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , normalized to the number of components , and we will have @xmath50\\ldots[d , z]\\rangle=\\gamma.\\ ] ] where we have introduced the average @xmath51 that , in this case , reduces to matrix traces . in order to see the quantization of the volume ,",
    "let us consider a three dimensional manifold and the sphere @xmath52 . from eq.([eq",
    ": z ] ) one has @xmath53\\ldots[d , z]\\rangle d^3x\\ ] ] and doing the traces one has @xmath54 it is easy to see that this will yield@xcite @xmath55 the coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 belongs to unitary spheres and the dirac operator has a discrete spectrum , so we are covering all the manifold with a large integer number of these spheres .",
    "thus , the volume is quantized as this condition requires .",
    "this can be extended to four dimensions with some more work @xcite .      differently from an ordinary stochastic process , a wiener process on a quantized manifold will yield the projection of the spectrum @xmath19 of the coordinates on the two kind of spheres @xmath56 .",
    "this will depend on the way a particle moves on the manifold taking into account that the distribution of the two kind of unitary volumes is absolutely random .",
    "one can construct a process @xmath57 such that , against a toss of a coin , one gets 1 or i as outcome , assuming the distribution of the unitary volumes is uniform .",
    "this can be written @xmath58 with @xmath59 a bernoulli process producing the value @xmath60 depending on the unitary volume hit by the particle such that @xmath61 , a deterministic process giving always 1 , and @xmath62 . if we want to consider the brownian motion of the particle on such a manifold we should expect the outcomes to be either @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "so , given the set of @xmath49 matrices and the chirality operator @xmath63 , the most general form for a stochastic process on the manifold can be written down ( summation on @xmath64 is implied ) @xmath65 being @xmath66 arbitrary coefficients of this linear combination .",
    "the bernoulli processes @xmath67 and the wiener process @xmath68 can not be independent . rather , the sign arising from the bernoulli process is the same of that of the corresponding wiener process .",
    "this equation provides the equivalent of the eq.([eq : y ] ) for the coordinates on the manifold .",
    "this is exactly the formula we will obtain for the fractional powers of a wiener process .",
    "it just represents the motion on a quantized riemannian manifold with two kind of quanta .",
    "underlying quantum mechanics there appears to be a noncommutative geometry .",
    "we consider an ordinary wiener @xmath69 process describing a brownian motion and define the @xmath70-th power of it .",
    "we do a proof of existence by construction using a numerical integration technique of a stochastic differential equations ( sde ) @xcite",
    ". we will have the process ( given @xmath71 ) with definition @xmath72 we build it through the euler  maruyama definition of a stochastic process @xcite at discrete times @xmath73 this is equivalent to take the power and then a ( cumulative ) sum exactly as done in simulating a wiener process when @xmath74 .",
    "for our numerical test we consider the square root process with @xmath75 as it is the one of interest for quantum mechanics . in this case",
    "the wiener process has two components : one real and another imaginary .",
    "we just compare the original brownian motion with the square of its square root given by numerically solving eq.([eq : e - m ] ) .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    ]",
    "the results are perfectly identical and our definition by euler ",
    "maruyama technique just works .",
    "the square root process is so shown to exist by construction .",
    "we note that the need for a complex valued stochastic process is essential if we aim to recover quantum mechanics . on the other side , taking the square root of values that can have both positive and negative values entails coping with complex numbers .",
    "one can always take the power of whatever sequence of numbers as that of a wiener process .",
    "using it calculus to express the square root process with more elementary stochastic processes @xcite , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 , we could tentatively set @xmath81 being @xmath82 an arbitrary scale factor and @xmath83 a bernoulli process equivalent to a coin tossing that has the property @xmath84 .",
    "this process is characterized by the values @xmath1 and @xmath0 and it is like the brownian motion went scattering with two different kinds of small pieces of space , each one contributing either 1 or i to the process , randomly .",
    "we have introduced the process @xmath85 that yields just the signs of the corresponding wiener process .",
    "eq.([eq : sqrt ] ) is unsatisfactory for a reason , taking the square yields @xmath86 and the original wiener process is not exactly recovered .",
    "we find added a process that has the effect to change the scale of the original brownian motion while retaining the shape .",
    "we can fix this problem by using pauli matrices .",
    "let us consider two pauli matrices @xmath87 with @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "we can rewrite the above identity as @xmath90 and so , @xmath91 as it should , after removing the identity matrix on both sides .",
    "this idea generalizes easily to higher dimensions using @xmath63 matrices . in the following",
    "we will omit the contribution due to the pauli matrices but it will be implied to remove the unwanted scale changing process .    now , let us consider a more general square root process where we assume also a term proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "this forces to take @xmath93 when the square is taken , to recover the original stochastic process , and one has @xmath94^\\frac{1}{2}=",
    "\\left[\\frac{1}{2}+dw(t)\\cdot{\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t))+(-1+\\beta{\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t)))dt\\right]\\phi_{\\frac{1}{2}}(t).\\ ] ] from the bernoulli process @xmath95 we can derive @xmath96 then , we get a double fokker ",
    "planck equation for a free particle , being the distribution function @xmath97 complex valued , @xmath98 this should be expected as we have a complex stochastic process and then two fokker ",
    "planck equations are needed to describe it .",
    "we have obtained an equation strongly resembling the schrdinger equation for a complex distribution function .",
    "we can ask at this point if indeed are recovering quantum mechanics . in the following section we will perform a numerical check of this hypothesis .",
    "if really the square root process diffuses as a solution of the schrdinger equation we should be able to recover the corresponding solution for the kernel @xmath99 sampling the square root process .",
    "to see this we note that a wick rotation , @xmath100 , turns it into a heat kernel as we get immediately @xmath101 a montecarlo simulation can be easily executed extracting the square root of a brownian motion and , after a wick rotation , to show that a heat kernel is obtained .",
    "we have generated 10000 paths of brownian motion and extracted its square root in the way devised in sec .",
    "we have evaluated the corresponding distribution after wick rotating the results for the square root .",
    "the wick rotation generates real results as it should be expected and a comparison can be performed . the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]        the quality of the fit can be evaluated being @xmath102 with confidence interval @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 with confidence interval @xmath105 $ ] for the heat kernel while one has @xmath106 with confidence interval @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 with confidence interval @xmath109 $ ] for the schrdinger kernel .",
    "both are centered around 0 and there is a factor @xmath110 between standard deviations as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpsch ] ) . both the fits are exceedingly good .",
    "having recovered the schrdinger kernel from brownian motion with the proper scaling factors in mean and standard deviation , we can conclude that we are doing quantum mechanics : _ square root of a brownian motion describes the motion of a quantum particle_. need for pauli matrices , as shown in the preceding section , implies that spin can not be neglected .",
    "in order to understand how to introduce a potential within this approach we use the following mapping theorem between the fokker  planck and the schrdinger equation @xcite :    the fokker  planck operator for a gradient flow can be written in the self - adjoint form @xmath111 _ define now @xmath112 .",
    "then @xmath113 solves the pde _ @xmath114    on the basis of the given theorem , we can immediately generalize our formulation to the case of a potential .",
    "we will have @xmath115^\\frac{1}{2}=\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}+dw\\cdot{\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t))+      ( -1+u(x , t){\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t)))dt\\right\\}\\phi_{\\frac{1}{2}}(t).\\ ] ] the corresponding fokker ",
    "planck equation will be @xmath116-\\frac{i}{4}\\frac{\\partial^2\\hat\\psi}{\\partial x^2}.\\ ] ] as an example we consider a harmonic oscillator with @xmath117 @xmath118^\\frac{1}{2}=\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}+dw\\cdot{\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t))+      \\left(-1+\\frac{k}{2}x^2{\\operatorname{sgn}}(dw(t))\\right)dt\\right\\}\\phi_{\\frac{1}{2}}(t).\\ ] ] here @xmath119 is an arbitrary constant and the quantum potential is @xmath120 , using the mapping between the fokker ",
    "planck and the schrdinger equations .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation will be @xmath121 with the introduction of @xmath122 as we get what is conventionally a time - reversed quantum evolution .",
    "we have seen that , in order to extract the square root of a stochastic process , we needed pauli matrices or , generally speaking , a clifford algebra .",
    "this idea was initially put forward by dirac to derive his relativistic equation for fermions .",
    "the simplest and non - trivial choice is obtained , as said above , using pauli matrices @xmath123 that satisfy @xmath124 this proves to be insufficient to go to dimensions higher than 1 + 1 for brownian motion .",
    "the more general solution is provided by a dirac algebra of @xmath63 matrices @xmath125 such that @xmath126 being @xmath127 the minkowski metric . in this way",
    "one can introduce three different brownian motions for each spatial coordinates and three different bernoulli processes for each of them .",
    "the definition is now @xmath128 it is now easy to check that @xmath129 the fokker - planck equations have a solution with 4 components , as now the distribution functions are dirac spinors .",
    "these are given by @xmath130 being @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that , the general formula for the square root process implies immediately spin and antimatter for quantum mechanics that now come out naturally .",
    "but this appears just like the non - relativistic limit of the dirac equation and so , having already introduced the @xmath63 matrices at this stage , it should be natural to get a fully covariant dirac equation . in the next section",
    "we will show that this indeed the case so that , the metric element of a noncommutative geometry arise naturally as the fokker  planck equation of a stochastic process .",
    "dirac equation works on a 4-dimensional manifold and so , we will need four wiener processes to derive it .",
    "this assures full lorentz invariance but , on the other side , time should be treated as any other space variable .",
    "we need a further time variable , a fictitious one ( as happens in stochastic quantization ) , to get fokker ",
    "planck equations in this case . to accomplish this one has to introduce the @xmath132 matrix , as already seen in noncommutative geometry , in the following way @xmath133 now one has a fictitious time variable @xmath134 but we have a full family of solutions to the fokker - planck equations parametrized by @xmath134 . only the fixed point solutions , the eigenstate with zero eigenvalue , reproduce the klein - gordon equation for a free massless particle with a dirac spinor .",
    "@xmath135 this recovers completely dirac theory for a free particle from brownian motions .",
    "we recognize in eq.([eq : dirac ] ) the same stochastic process arising in noncommutative geometry in eq.([eq : ncgsp ] ) .",
    "we have shown the existence of a class of stochastic processes that can support quantum behavior . a typical one is the square root of a brownian motion",
    "from which the schrdinger equation comes out naturally .",
    "the case with a potential was also discussed and applied to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "finally , we have derived the dirac equation while spin and antimatter are naturally introduced by a stochastic behavior .",
    "this formalism could entail a new understanding of quantum mechanics and give serious hints on the properties of space - time for quantum gravity .",
    "this yields a deep connection with noncommutative geometry as formulated by alain connes through the more recent proposal of space quantization by connes himself , chamseddine and mukhanov .",
    "this quantization of volume entails two kind of quanta implying naturally the unity @xmath19 that arises in the square root of a wiener process .",
    "indeed , a general stochastic process for a particle moving on such a quantized volume corresponds to our formula of the square root of a stochastic process on a 4-dimensional manifold .",
    "spin appears to be an essential ingredient , already at a formal level , to treat such fractional powers of brownian motion .    finally , it should be interesting , and rather straightforward , to generalize this approach to a dirac equation on a generic manifold",
    ". the idea would be to recover also einstein equations as a fixed point solution to the fokker - planck equations as already happens in string theory .",
    "then they would appear as a the result of a thermodynamic system at the equilibrium based on noncommutative geometry .",
    "this is left for further study .",
