    "possible interactions between branes and black holes in higher dimensions are interesting and important problems in many fields of modern theoretical physics . one direction , which has been recently introduced by frolov @xcite , is a spherically symmetric black hole interacting with dirac - nambu - goto ( dng ) test branes @xcite in arbitrary brane and bulk dimensions",
    ". this brane - black hole system , beyond the interest of its own , has also proven to be very useful as a toy model for various other problems .",
    "for example , it posses striking similarities in its properties to the problem of topology changing and merger transitions between higher dimensional black solutions @xcite , and also shows a self - similar behavior , very similar to the choptuik critical collapse phenomenon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also turned out to be a relevant model in investigating holographic phase transitions in strongly coupled gauge theories @xcite , via the gauge / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "generalizations to the system , by considering small thickness corrections to the branes , have also been studied lately by frolov and gorbonos @xcite , and more extensively ( also within a more general framework ) by us @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this extension was to consider higher order , curvature corrections to the thin brane action , which , in the holographic dual picture , correspond to finite t hooft coupling corrections , and provide a more realistic description of the phase transition @xcite .    in the present paper , as a sequel to our previous works on the subject matter @xcite",
    ", we provide another generalization of the problem into a different direction .",
    "we investigate the brane - black hole system in the rotating case by considering a myers - perry black hole in the background with a single angular momentum .",
    "the motivation of this work is also clear , we would like to understand the role that rotational effects play when a quasi - static , topology changing transition is considered in the system .",
    "the problem is interesting not only from the geometrical point of view , but also because it may provide further insights to other topology changing- or merger transition problems in higher dimensional , classical general relativity , or to certain holographic phase transitions in the gauge / gravity dual picture .    in constructing the model ,",
    "we follow the method of @xcite as closely as possible , and define the dng - branes with the highest possible symmetry properties that the background allows . by this construction",
    "the branes posses a total of @xmath2 group of symmetry , and just as in the spherical case , the brane action simplifies radically , resulting the problem of an ordinary differential equation ( highly non - linear though ) for the brane configurations .",
    "we present and analyze the general solution of this problem , first analytically in far distances , and later numerically in the near horizon region .    as a result",
    ", we obtain that due to the coordinate parametrization of the myers - perry metric , this rotating problem is not compatible with the spherical results of @xcite , in the sense that the latter ones are not recovered in the non - rotating limit .",
    "although the ideal situation would be to provide a rotating solution which is the `` corresponding '' one to the spherical problem in the above sense , nevertheless we could not find an appropriate coordinate system in which this could be done in a natural way as presented by frolov in @xcite , and as we also do it here .",
    "consequently , we conclude that while the construction of the problem is the closest possible to the spherical case , the obtained results are qualitatively different , except in the special case of a 3-dimensional brane .",
    "furthermore , we also find that stationary equatorial solutions do not generally exist for arbitrary brane dimensions , except again for the case of a 3-dimensional brane , and as a result , we can not study the quasi - static phase transition in the geometric setup as we did in the thickness corrected spherical case @xcite by following the method of flachi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ bm ] .",
    "we define the rotating brane - black hole system analogous to the spherical case . in section",
    "we obtain the brane equation and discuss its incompatibility with the results of @xcite . in section [ as ] .",
    ", first we discuss the analytic properties of the solutions in the near horizon region and derive unique boundary conditions for the topologically different solutions from regularity requirements .",
    "then , we obtain the far distance solution in an analytic form , and analyze its properties . in section [ nr ] .  we present and illustrate the numerical results in the near horizon region , and finally in section [ concl ] .  we draw our conclusions .",
    "in addition , we discuss the problem of the coordinate systems in an appendix section .",
    "the metric of the @xmath1-dimensional myers - perry solution @xcite in boyer - lindquist coordinates with a single angular momentum is given by @xmath4d\\varphi^2 \\nonumber\\\\    & + 2a\\tfrac{f}{\\sigma}\\sin^2\\theta dtd\\varphi+\\tfrac{\\sigma}{\\delta}dr^2+\\sigma d\\theta^2\\nonumber\\\\   & + r^2\\cos^2\\theta d\\omega_{n-4}^2\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5and @xmath6 is the line element on an @xmath7-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related to the total mass , @xmath10 , and angular momentum , @xmath11 , of the black hole as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the area of an @xmath14-dimensional unit sphere @xmath15 . for simplicity , without any loss of generality , we can fix the value of the mass parameter @xmath8 to 1 .",
    "test brane configurations in an external gravitational field can be obtained by solving the euler - lagrange equation derived from the dirac - nambu - goto action @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the induced metric on the brane and @xmath18 are coordinates on the brane world sheet .",
    "the brane tension does not enter into the brane equations , thus for simplicity it can also be put equal to @xmath19 .",
    "we introduce coordinates in the bulk as @xmath20 and it is assumed that the brane is stationary , spherically symmetric in the @xmath21 dimensions , rotationally symmetric in the @xmath22 coordinate , and , if @xmath23 , its surface is chosen to obey the equations @xmath24 with the above properties the brane world sheet allows an @xmath2 group of symmetry , and can be completely defined by the single function @xmath25 .",

    "the dirac - nambu - goto action ( [ action0 ] ) reduces to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary interval of time , @xmath33 is the area of the unit sphere @xmath34 , the @xmath35 factor is obtained from the integration with respect to @xmath22 , and the lagrangian takes the form @xmath36",
    "test brane configurations are solutions of the euler - lagrange equation @xmath37which for the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) reads as @xmath38where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 the horizon of the black hole is defined as the largest solution of @xmath42 , and one can consider the non - rotating problem by taking the @xmath43 limit .    in the case of the non - rotating limit however , one notices that the euler - lagrange equation , obtained from ( [ eq ] ) , is not identical to the one that has been obtained and analyzed by frolov in @xcite , and what we also investigated in the presence of thickness corrections in the spherically symmetric case @xcite . after some analysis",
    "one can show that the difference stems from the different coordinate systems used by the myers - perry and schwarzschild - tangherlini solutions @xcite , and which disappears in standard @xmath44-dimensions in the @xmath43 limit , but remains present in higher dimensions , even after taking the non - rotating limit . the detailed calculation to show this is a bit lengthy ,",
    "therefore we present it as an appendix at the end of the paper .    as a consequence",
    ", it is very important to emphasize that the dng - brane , defined as @xmath45 in the previous section , is _ not _ the `` corresponding '' brane to the one that we investigated in the schwarzschild - tangherlini case , in the sense , that it does _ not _ reproduce the spherical results of @xcite in the non - rotating limit .",
    "this is because the angular coordinate @xmath46 , through which the brane is defined in the myers - perry metric , is different from the one ( denoted with the same letter @xmath46 ) in the schwarzschild - tangherlini solution , even after taking the non - rotating limit .",
    "they correspond trivially only in 4-dimensions , where we are accustomed to obtain the schwarzschild coordinates in the non - rotating limit of the kerr solution .",
    "it may also worth to mention that we ve been trying to find an appropriate coordinate system for the rotating case , where those `` corresponding '' branes , which would reproduce the solutions of @xcite as their non - rotating limit , could be defined naturally .",
    "the problem , however , turns out to be very difficult , because in those systems where the limit in the bulk is automatic , either the definition of the rotationally symmetric brane is problematic , or the coordinate transformations involve angles from the extra dimensions of the metric , which can not be integrated out from the action in the simple way as we did in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "although we believe that the problem should ultimately be resolved in one way or another , nevertheless , we were not able to obtain a satisfactory resolution so far .",
    "accordingly , in the present paper we are focusing on those dng - branes which are defined in section [ bm ] , and are the solutions of the euler - lagrange equation ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the problem is , of course , interesting in its own right , being the most naturally defined dng - brane problem on a rotating black hole background in arbitrary dimensions , and also the most natural extension of the spherical problem to the simplest rotating case .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that it is essentially different from the one , that would provide back the schwarzschild - tangherlini solution of @xcite in the non - rotating limit .",
    "in this section we present the near horizon- and far distance asymptotic solutions of the brane equation . from regularity requirements in the near horizon region , we obtain unique boundary conditions for the problem which will be used for the numerical solution in the following section .      for a brane crossing",
    "the horizon ( black hole embedding case or supercritical branch in frolov s terminology @xcite ) , ( [ eq ] ) has a regular singular point on the horizon , @xmath47 . a regular solution at this point has the following expansion near the horizon @xmath48 where the regularity requirement impose the condition @xmath49",
    "consequently , supercritical solutions are all uniquely determined by their boundary value @xmath50 .    in the minkowski embedding ( subcritical ) case , the brane does not cross the horizon , and its surface reaches its minimal distance from the black hole at @xmath51 , which , for symmetry reasons , occurs at @xmath52 .",
    "a regular ( but not smooth or even differentiable , see @xcite ) solution of ( [ eq ] ) near this point has the asymptotic behavior @xmath53where the regularity requirement on the axis of rotation impose the conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 + \\tfrac{2\\kappa\\dot\\delta+\\ddot\\delta}{4}\\right)\\right]_{r_1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 hence , all subcritical solutions are also uniquely determined by the single parameter , @xmath57 .      since the myers - perry solution is asymptotically flat",
    ", the brane function @xmath45 has to converge to a constant value , @xmath58 , as @xmath59 .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath58 is not known for the moment ( in contrast with the spherical case where it was @xmath60 for all dimensions ) , rather it can be obtained by the following consideration . the far distance solution of ( [ eq ] ) can be searched in a perturbative form @xmath61where @xmath62 is a first - order small function compared to @xmath58 , and we require that @xmath63 we shall only keep the linear terms of @xmath64 in ( [ eq ] ) which yields the asymptotic equation @xmath65 the general solution of ( [ tinfeq ] ) reads as @xmath66 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 before running into the analysis of the complex powers in the solution , we notice that the first term of ( [ tinfsol ] ) is a constant .",
    "thus ( [ tinfsol ] ) can only be a good solution of ( [ tinfeq ] ) if @xmath68 , due to the requirement ( [ limnu ] ) .",
    "this implies the asymptotic constraint @xmath69 and yields the asymptotic value @xmath70.\\ ] ] according to this result , we can conclude that for each brane dimension , @xmath71 , the solutions have different asymptotic behavior , and the asymptotic value , @xmath58 , coincides with the schwarzschild - value , @xmath60 , only in the case of @xmath72 , that is , when the brane is 3-dimensional .",
    "it is interesting to note here that 3-dimensional branes tend to behave differently from their higher dimensional counterparts in other aspects too . in our previous works @xcite",
    ", we also found that 3-dimensional branes had exceptional analytic properties in the near horizon region when thickness corrections had been considered in the non - rotating case .",
    "another interesting feature to note is that the asymptotic value does not depend on the rotation parameter of the black hole , it is determined solely by the number of inner dimensions of the brane in which it is spherically symmetric .    after deriving the value for the asymptotic constants ,",
    "we can obtain the corresponding asymptotic solutions by plugging back @xmath58 into ( [ tinfeq ] ) , which results the asymptotic equation @xmath73 or plugging it directly into ( [ tinfsol ] ) , and take a bit of time with the power analysis .",
    "either case , the asymptotic solution takes the form @xmath74+p'\\cos[\\delta(r)]}{r^{1+\\frac{n}{2 } } }    -\\frac{a^2\\sqrt{n}}{2(n+1)r^2 } , & \\mbox{if $ n\\leq 4 $ , } \\\\\\\\",

    "the real change occurs , however , at @xmath78 , as we can see it from the following analysis .    in the @xmath72 case",
    ", the rotation of the black hole does not seem to affect the asymptotic behavior directly , and , as we mentioned earlier , this is the exceptional case of the 3-dimensional brane , when the asymptotic value , @xmath58 , is @xmath60 , just as in the schwarzschild problem . when @xmath79 , the first term dominates the solution , because the second one , which is controlled by the rotation parameter , decays faster . in the case of @xmath80 , both terms decay essentially as @xmath81 . in all other cases , starting from @xmath82 , the first terms in the solution decay",
    "much faster than the second one , which results that all the branes with @xmath83 or more dimensions have an almost uniform convergence to the asymptotic value in the far distance region , and this is controlled by the rotation parameter of the black hole .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the solutions are continuous functions of the @xmath50 or @xmath57 boundary parameters that we obtained previously from regularity requirements in the near horizon region . on the other hand , because of the complicated asymptotic behavior , the interpretation of @xmath84 or @xmath85 is not so clear as it was in the schwarzschild case ( being the distance of the brane from the asymptotic value at infinity @xcite ) .",
    "after obtaining the far distance solution of the problem in analytic form and also deriving boundary conditions from regularity requirements in the near horizon region , we can consider the numerical solution of ( [ eq ] ) . as it was shown earlier",
    ", the boundary value @xmath50 , or the radial coordinate @xmath57 , uniquely determines the corresponding super- or subcritical solutions , respectively .",
    "the numerical solution itself does not require very advanced techniques , we have performed it by using the ` mathematica`@xmath86 ` ndsolve ` function .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : n0 ]  we are plotting a sequence of @xmath87 ( @xmath72 ) brane solutions from both topologies in the near horizon region .",
    "the asymptotic constant in this special case is @xmath60 and we have chosen the value @xmath88 for the rotation parameter , @xmath9 . as a result (",
    "just as we expect from the far distance analysis ) the brane configurations are very similar to what we had before in the spherical case @xcite .",

    "the branes with boundary values @xmath103 deviate strongly from @xmath58 in the near horizon region , while the branes with @xmath104 approach the asymptotic value very quickly .    in our previous works @xcite",
    ", we also investigated the problem of a quasi - static evolution of a brane from the equatorial plane in black hole embeddings , to a minkowski embedding topology , through a topology change transition .",
    "the question was very natural there , following the method developed in @xcite , because the equatorial configuration was a general solution in every dimensions of the spherical problem . in the present rotating case however , as we saw above , the equatorial configuration is a solution of the problem only in the exceptional case of the 3-dimensional brane , and we can not use this method for a general discussion . although we could analyze the topological phase transition in this special case , nevertheless we believe that it would be misleading since the relevant problems are usually obtained from higher dimensions , like the case of the holographic dual phase transition . as a consequence , the question remains open in the present rotating case .",
    "in the present work , we studied the problem of rotationally symmetric , stationary , dirac - nambu - goto branes on the background of a myers - perry black hole with a single angular momentum . in defining the interacting brane - black hole system , we strongly followed the spherical problem given by frolov @xcite .",
    "although this model is the most natural extension of the spherical setup to the simplest rotating case , we found that due to the non - equivalent coordinate parametrization , the obtained solutions are not compatible with the spherical solutions in the sense that the latter ones are not recovered in the non - rotating limit .",
    "our efforts , to find an appropriate coordinate system in which the rotating problem could be formulated naturally , in a way that the spherical case could also be reproduced in the @xmath43 limit , has not succeeded so far .",
    "it is an open question whether it can be done at all .    after clarifying the above situation",
    ", we analyzed the properties of the obtained problem , and presented its solution both analytically , at far distances , and numerically , in the near horizon region .",
    "in the latter case , we found that the analytic properties of the test brane solutions , both on the axis of rotation and on the horizon , are very similar to what we saw in the spherical case . from regularity requirements",
    "we could obtain unique numerical solutions for each , freely chosen , boundary value in both topologies .    by analyzing the far distance solutions",
    ", we obtained a new interesting result that the asymptotic behavior of the rotating solutions are qualitatively different from the spherical problem , except in the special case of a 3-dimensional brane .",
    "this difference change the entire structure of the brane configurations in the near horizon region too , because all solutions are attracted asymptotically to the same constant value , independently of the near horizon boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic value is different for every brane dimensions , and it is controlled solely by the dimension parameter of the brane .",
    "another interesting result is that the rotation of the black hole has a direct effect only on how the solutions tend to the asymptotic value , and we illustrated this phenomenon in the cases of a small and a large rotation parameter .",
    "one of the motivations of this work was to understand the role that rotational effects may play in a quasi - static , topology changing phase transition of the system . as a negative result",
    ", we obtained that the problem can not be studied here in the geometrical way that we applied in the thickness corrected spherical problem @xcite , due to the lack of a general , stationary , equatorial solution for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "consequently , we could not obtain general results on the phase transition in this paper , so the question remains open for the rotating case .",
    "the lack of the equatorial solution has another consequence which is connected to the stability of the rotating brane - black hole system .",
    "it has been shown by hioki et al .",
    "@xcite that equatorial solutions are stable against small perturbations in the spherical case .",
    "stability is an important issue in higher dimensions , and it would be also important to know whether similar results may hold for the present axisymmetric case too . unfortunately , because of the lack of the equatorial solution , the question of stability can not be studied here by using the method of hioki et al .  for the general case .    as another stability issue , in this paper we have not considered the cases of extremal and ultra - spinning black holes .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that ultra - spinning black holes are expected to be unstable @xcite , and the instability limit occurs at a surprisingly low value of the angular momentum , i.e.  not far in the ultra - spinning regime .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the critical rotation parameter , @xmath9 , has been estimated by emparan and myers for several dimensions @xcite , and it turned out that a typical value is around @xmath105 . according to this , in the present paper we constrained ourselves to keep the value of the rotation parameter small enough to stay away from the presumably unstable regime .",

    "<S> stationary , @xmath0-dimensional test branes , interacting with @xmath1-dimensional myers - perry bulk black holes , are investigated in arbitrary brane and bulk dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the branes are asymptotically flat and axisymmetric around the rotation axis of the black hole with a single angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> they are also spherically symmetric in all other dimensions allowing a total of @xmath2 group of symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that even though this setup is the most natural extension of the spherical symmetric problem to the simplest rotating case in higher dimensions , the obtained solutions are not compatible with the spherical solutions in the sense that the latter ones are not recovered in the non - rotating limit . </S>",
    "<S> the brane configurations are qualitatively different from the spherical problem , except in the special case of a @xmath3-dimensional brane . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a quasi - static phase transition between the topologically different solutions can not be studied here , due to the lack of a general , stationary , equatorial solution . </S>"
