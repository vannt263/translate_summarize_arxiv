    "in 1967 - 73 , the four _ vela _ spacecraft ( named after the spanish verb _ velar _ , to keep watch ) , that where originally designed for verifying whether the former soviet union abided by the limited nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 , observed 16 peculiarly strong events ( klebesadel , olson and strong 1973 , bonnell and klebesadel 1996 ) . on the basis of arrival time differences , it was determined that they were related neither to the earth nor to the sun , but they were of cosmic origin .",
    "therefore they were named cosmic @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs hereafter ) .",
    "grbs appear as brief flashes of cosmic high energy photons , emitting the bulk of their energy above @xmath1 0.1 mev ( fig .",
    "they are detected by instruments somewhat similar to those used by the particle physicists at their laboratories .",
    "the difference is that grb detectors have to be placed onboard balloons , rockets or satellites . in spite of the abundance of new observations of grbs ,",
    "their energy source and emission mechanism remain highly speculative .",
    "the konus experiment on _ veneras 11 _ and _ 12 _ gave the first indication that grb sources were isotropically distributed in the sky ( mazets et al .",
    "1981 , atteia et al . 1987 ) .",
    "based on a much larger sample , this result was nicely confirmed by batse on board the _ cgro _ ( meegan et al . 1992 ) .",
    "about 300 grbs occur annually in the full sky , but only few of them are localized accurately .",
    "the apparent isotropy was interpreted in terms of grbs produced at cosmological distances , although the possibility of a small fraction of the sources lying nearby , within a galactic disc scale of few hundred pc , or in the halo of the galaxy , could not be discarded .",
    "another result was that the time profiles of the bursts are very different , with some grbs lasting a few ms and others lasting for several minutes .",
    "in general , there was no evidence of periodicity in the time histories of grbs .",
    "however there was indication of a bimodal distribution of burst durations , with @xmath225% of bursts having durations around 0.2 s and @xmath275% with durations around 30 s. a extensive review of the observational characteristics can be found in fishman and meegan ( 1995 )",
    ".    a deficiency of weak events was also noticed , and all these observational data led many researchers to believe that grbs are indeed at cosmological distances . in this case",
    ", the released energies could be as high as 10@xmath3 erg and models could involve coalescence of neutron stars in double systems , neutron star - black hole systems , accretion induced collapse in white dwarfs or @xmath4failed@xmath4 type i supernovae .",
    "it was also proposed the possibility of having a mixture of two populations : a cosmological plus a galactic one , but the latter , probably formed by accreting neutron stars , will account for only a very small fraction of the total population .",
    "see nemiroff ( 1984 ) for a review of the different theoretical models .",
    "it is well known that an important clue for resolving the grb puzzle is the detection of transient emission -at longer wavelengths- associated with the bursts .",
    "here i review all the efforts in the search for grb counterparts throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "i will first review the searches prior to 1997 , and afterwards i will discuss the important discoveries achieved last year .",
    "previous reviews can be seen in schaefer ( 1994 ) , hartmann ( 1995 ) , vrba ( 1996 ) , greiner ( 1996a ) and hurley ( 1998 ) .",
    "the observation of x - rays below 20 kev is important in order to understand the nature of the physical processes in the grb sources .",
    "most of the experiments devoted to grb study had lower cut - off energies of the order of 20 - 40 kev .",
    "however , a few of them were designed in order to cover part of the soft x - ray range .    already in 1972 , the apollo 16 spectrometer detected x - ray photons in the 2 - 8 kev range for grb 720427 ( trombka et al .",

    "( 1973 ) observed in grb 720514 the presence of an x - ray signal which lasted _ longer _ than the gamma - ray event . in 1984 , katoh et al .",
    "reported an x - ray tail for grb 811016 that lasted more than 30 s after the termination of the hard event .",
    "_ ginga _ also detected emission down to 1.5 kev , with soft x - ray tails found for 8 events ( murakami et al .",
    "1991 , yoshida and murakami 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , a significant fraction ( @xmath2 10% ) of the grbs detected by watch on _ granat _ displayed x - ray tails in the 6 - 20 kev range ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "connors and mcconnell ( 1996 ) have discussed the proposal that the x - ray transient detected by",
    "_ heao 1 _ following grb 780506 could indeed be related to the burst itself .",
