    "since their discovery by iijima in 1991,@xcite carbon nanotubes and their fascinating properties have attracted the attention of both theoretical and experimental physicists.@xcite nanotubes are basically long cylinders , their walls being formed from one ( single - walled carbon nanotubes , swcn ) or several ( multiple - walled ones , mwcn ) graphite sheets .",
    "one of its more important features is its extremely narrow width , with diameters in the nanometer scale , ranging from @xmath2 7 to 40  , compared to its length , thousands of times larger .",
    "the enormous length to diameter ratio and the narrowness of the tube make nanotubes excellent systems to hold inside nearly perfect one - dimensional fluids .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of its narrowness , the adsorption energy of an atom or molecule inside a carbon nanotube is several times greater than on planar graphite .",
    "this feature ensures that any particle of adequate size will be swallowed inside carbon nanotubes , provided that the half - fullerene caps at their ends are removed .",
    "its use as a possible solution to the packing of h@xmath0 in fuel cells has been discussed in the literature . @xcite    apart from its technological interest , the quasi - one dimensionality of these carbon tubes is itself an interesting property from a purely theoretical point of view . in the same way that a sheet of graphite provides an almost perfectly 2d experimental environment ,",
    "the small transversal room available to the particles adsorbed in a narrow carbon nanotube creates a proper setup to extract experimental information of quasi - one - dimensional systems . additionally , if the temperature is low enough , quantum effects become important , and an experimental realization of a quasi - one - dimensional quantum fluid is realized .",
    "a first step in that direction has been recently given by teizel _",
    "et al_,@xcite who unambiguously observed the quasi - one dimensional behaviour of @xmath1he adsorbed inside swcn bundles .",
    "the helium intake could be directed either to the inside of the nanotubes , to the interstitial channels between the several tubes constituting a bundle , or to the external surface of the nanotube bundle .",
    "the occupation probability in the three regions depends on the geometry of the bundle , on the _ size _ of the atom / molecule to be adsorbed and , finally , on the interatomic potential between the carbon atom and each particular species .",
    "@xcite in all cases , an almost perfect alignment of the atoms is granted .",
    "encouraged by this experimental accessibility , some theoretical work about the adsorption of quantum liquids inside nanotubes has been carried out .",
    "the most studied case is @xmath1he , which has been considered both in 1d and inside a ( 5,5 ) nanotube . in the limit of zero temperature ,",
    "both 1d and quasi - one - dimensional @xmath1he are self - bound systems , with a binding energy ranging the milikelvin scale.@xcite    molecular hydrogen inside nanotubes is also a very appealing system .",
    "in fact , the confinement of h@xmath0 in swcn , in the limit of zero temperature , has recently deserved theoretical work .",
    "its mass is approximately half the @xmath1he one , but the hydrogen - hydrogen interatomic potential has a potential well three times deeper than the helium - helium one .",
    "this prevents the existence of a liquid phase at zero temperature in both 2d and 3d , but diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations@xcite have shown that it is not enough to preclude it in 1d .",
    "this result is due to the reduced number of neighbours of each atom .",
    "in fact , this liquid state could be produced also in higher dimensions when the number of molecules surrounding a particular one is artificially reduced , as in small clusters@xcite ( 3d ) and in surfaces doped with the right kind of impurities@xcite ( 2d ) .    in the present work",
    ", the dmc method is used to study the influence of both the interparticle potential and mass on the thermodynamic behavior of the isotopes of molecular hydrogen , especially h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 , adsorbed inside a carbon nanotube .",
    "since the electronic structure of molecular deuterium and hydrogen is the same , the d@xmath0-d@xmath0 interparticle potential is identical to the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 one .",
    "this is equally true for the particle - tube interactions .",
    "moreover , the mass of the d@xmath0 molecule is very similar to that of a @xmath1he atom .",
    "thus , by comparing the deuterium results with those for helium , the effect of the respective potential wells can be inferred . on the other hand",
    ", the influence of the zero - point energy in the thermodynamic behavior of a quasi - one dimensional array can be drawn from the comparison between the deuterium and hydrogen results .",
    "in the last part of the paper , we present results for the equation of state of h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , and @xmath1he when they are adsorbed in the interstitial channels of a nanotube bundle .",
    "the influence of neighbouring arrays in a particular one , as a function of the interchannel separation , is studied using the dmc equation of state of purely 1d systems .",
    "the attractive van der waals tails between the arrays increase the binding energy of the adsorbed liquid in a quantity which decreases with the interchannel separation . using the dmc method ,",
    "it is verified that a _ mean field _",
    "approximation , as suggested in ref . , is very accurate at realistic separations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the dmc algorithm used to study both the fluid adsorbed in a nanotube and the purely one - dimensional model . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare results of the equation of state and spatial structure for the two isotopes , h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 .",
    "predictions for the equations of state of both isotopes , when the adsorbtion is in the interstitial channels , are also reported .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv comprises the summary and the main conclusions of our work .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo method , @xcite is a theoretical tool that has proved its accuracy in a large variety of systems and physical scales .",
    "it solves in a stochastic way the schrdinger equation , providing results for the ground state which are exact for boson systems like the present one .",
    "the @xmath3-body schrdinger equation is solved in imaginary time after the introduction of importance sampling , a standard technique to reduce the variance and make the algorithm operative .",
    "explicitely , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a trial wave function used for importance sampling and @xmath7 the imaginary - time - dependent wave function . in eq .",
    "( [ dmc1 ] ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the local energy , and @xmath10 is the so - called drift force which guides the diffusion movement to regions where @xmath6 is large .",
    "dmc calculations have been carried out for two different situations : _ i _ ) a pure 1d array of d@xmath0 molecules , and _ ii _ ) d@xmath0 filling a tube of radius @xmath11 = 3.42  , corresponding to the ( 5,5 ) armchair nanotube in the standard nomenclature.@xcite this structure has been chosen because it is one of the narrowest nanotubes experimentally obtained , and therefore it is expected to be close to an ideal 1d arrangement .    in the present calculation",
    ", we have considered the d@xmath0 molecules interacting via the silvera and goldman ( sg ) pair potential.@xcite this semiempirical interaction is the same that has been used in ref . in the study of h@xmath0 in tubes , and has become the standard approach in molecular hydrogen and molecular deuterium calculations . the sg interaction is a spherically averaged model , even though the pair of molecules involved are ellipsoids .",
    "however , the eccentricity of the ellipsoids is so small ( @xmath12 = 0.94 , in the h@xmath0 case ) that it produces results of remarkably accuracy , even at low temperatures . for the d@xmath0-tube interaction we have used the stan and cole ( sc)@xcite h@xmath0-tube interaction",
    "this is a cylindrically averaged potential , i.e. , the potential felt by a molecule inside the tube is a function only of its distance to the center of the tube .",
    "we have verified that the differences between the results obtained with this averaged interaction and the ones derived by explicitely summing up all the c - d@xmath0 interactions inside the tube are negligible .",
    "the sc potential depends only on three parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the radius of the tube . for the ( 5,5 ) tube considered , @xmath15  , and the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the lennard - jones c - h@xmath0 interaction ( @xmath16   and @xmath17 k).@xcite in fig .",
    "1 , the h@xmath0-tube sc potential is displayed and compared to the @xmath1he potential inside the same cylinder .",
    "the two curves reflect the differences between the pair ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) for @xmath1he and h@xmath0 ; the larger values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 in the case of h@xmath0 originates a deeper well and a shorter range , respectively .",
    "the trial wave function @xmath18 used in the 1d system is    @xmath19    with @xmath20 a jastrow wave function with a mcmillan two - body correlation factor .    for the simulation of d@xmath0 inside the tube , an additional one - body factor",
    "is introduced in order to avoid the hard core of the tube - molecule interaction , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the radial distance of the particle to the center of the cylinder .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 entering in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , have been determined by means of a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) optimization . near the equilibrium density",
    "we find the optimal value @xmath28  , gradually increasing with the linear density @xmath29 ( at @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32  ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 , inversely proportional to the width of the gaussian defined in @xmath27 , has been fixed to @xmath33 @xmath34 due to its negligible dependence on the density .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these parameters are different from the ones used for h@xmath0 in the same setup@xcite ( @xmath35  , @xmath36 @xmath34 ) .",
    "in order to study the behavior of the several isotopes of molecular hydrogen inside nanotubes , the dependence of the adsorption energy on the mass species constitutes a first relevant point .",
    "since the interparticle and tube - molecule potentials do not distinguish between isotopes , their different masses play the central role . at low densities ,",
    "the dominant effect is due to the binding energy of single independent molecules . from our dmc calculations the binding energy of a single molecule inside a carbon tube turns out to be , for the ( 5,5 ) tube , @xmath37 k for h@xmath0 , and @xmath38 k and @xmath39 k for d@xmath0 and t@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the increase in the binding energy with the mass comes from the combination of two features : a decrease in the kinetic energy , mainly due to a direct effect of the mass ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , and a simultaneous increase of the potential energy .",
    "although those energies correspond to the ground state of single molecules at 0 k , they constitute a very good estimation in the limit of infinite dilution at nonzero temperatures . from the above binding energies one can extract information on the selectivity in the adsorption inside the nanotube . following ref .",
    ", the selectivity of isotope 2 with respect to isotope 1 can be defined by the quotient @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) the nanotube ( bulk ) mole fractions .",
    "it has been proved that in the limit of zero pressure the selectivity @xmath45 is very well approximated by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the binding energy of isotope @xmath48 .",
    "considering @xmath49 k , as in ref . , we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the ( 5,5 ) tube .",
    "the selectivity is especially high in the case t@xmath0/h@xmath0 due to the sizeable difference in binding energies between the two isotopes , @xmath52 k. that large selectivity , which is a purely quantum effect , has been proposed in ref . to achieve an efficient isotopic sieving .",
    "the ground - state properties of an array of hydrogen molecules , in a one- and in a quasi - one - dimensional environments , have also been studied using the dmc method . in a previous work,@xcite",
    "we had studied the case of h@xmath0 : the equilibrium state in 1d corresponds to a liquid phase with a density @xmath53 @xmath31 and an energy per particle @xmath54 k. a first approach to determine the equation of state of 1d d@xmath0 is based on the use of the average correlation approximation ( aca ) .",
    "this approximation , which has been widely used in the @xmath55he-@xmath1he isotopic mixture in the limit of zero @xmath55he concentration,@xcite consists in the present case in evaluating the expectation value of the hamiltonian for d@xmath0 using the _ exact _ wave function of the other isotope ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , the energy per particle of d@xmath0 in aca is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the kinetic energy of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "aca corresponds , obviously , to a variational estimate and thus the d@xmath0 energies obtained from eq .",
    "( [ acaener ] ) are upper bounds to the exact values . using the dmc kinetic energies of 1d h@xmath0 reported in table i , and the total energies published in ref . , we have calculated the aca equation of state for d@xmath0 .",
    "the results obtained are shown in fig . 2 and compared with the exact solution derived from a dmc calculation of 1d d@xmath0 .",
    "both equations of state ( lines ) correspond to a least squares fit to the data in the usual form @xmath58 the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are given in table ii .",
    "the upper bounds provided by aca appear clearly reflected in fig . 2 , its _ quality _ being quite reasonable taking into account its straightforward estimation ( [ acaener ] ) .",
    "in fact , the discrepancies between aca and the exact results are less than 2 % for the equilibrium density value , and around 3 % for the binding energies .",
    "aca can also be used to estimate the equation of state of the t@xmath0 fluid , a system that we have not studied here using the explicit dmc calculation . for 1d t@xmath0 ,",
    "aca predicts @xmath63 @xmath31 and @xmath64 k.    on the other hand , the equation of state of d@xmath0 inside a tube can also be estimated by aca , since the tube - molecule sc potential does not depend on the particular isotope . using the h@xmath0 equation of state ( ref . ) and the h@xmath0 kinetic energies reported in table i , the aca results compare with the corresponding dmc ones with an accuracy similar to the 1d case .",
    "dmc energy results for both 1d d@xmath0 and d@xmath0 adsorbed in the ( 5,5 ) nanotube are displayed in fig .",
    "in order to show the two equations of state with the same energy scale , we have subtracted to the tube results the adsorption energy of a single molecule . in fig .",
    "3 , the curves are polynomial fits ( [ eqestat ] ) to the dmc data , the optimal parameters for the tube being reported in table ii . it can be seen that the equilibrium density for 1d d@xmath0 and d@xmath0 adsorbed in the ( 5,5 ) nanotube are almost identical .",
    "this is also true for the location of the spinodal points of d@xmath0 , @xmath65 @xmath31 and @xmath66 @xmath31 , which can be derived from the data contained in table ii .",
    "the binding energies , in the respective equilibrium points ( @xmath59 ) , are slightly different : the additional transverse degree of freedom only amounts to an increase of 0.091 k. this increase in the binding energy is nearly a factor two smaller than the one drawn from the dmc calculations for h@xmath0 ( 0.172 k ) . in relative terms",
    ", the increase of the binding energy is only a 0.85 % for d@xmath0 versus a 3.5 % for h@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the effects of the additional degree of freedom of the d@xmath0 molecules in the radial direction inside the nanotube , which account for the enhancement of the binding energy , are reduced by the greater mass of the d@xmath0 molecule with respect to the h@xmath0 one . as a matter of comparison , it is illustrative to compare the effects observed in d@xmath0 with the ones previously studied in @xmath1he using the same methodology and geometry",
    ". it is worth noticing that the masses of d@xmath0 and @xmath1he are nearly the same whereas the interatomic potentials are sizeably different .",
    "the dmc results show that the latter effect is completely determinant : in @xmath1he the relative difference mentioned above is 90 % , two orders of magnitude larger than in d@xmath0 .",
    "another minor effect that contributes to the one - dimensionality of molecular deuterium adsorbed inside the tube , is the larger hard - core size of the c - d@xmath0 interaction ( @xmath67  ) , versus the c - he one ( @xmath68  ) .",
    "the mass versus potential effects can also be seen in the value of the equilibrium density . inside the tube",
    ", @xmath60 goes from @xmath69 @xmath31 in @xmath1he , to @xmath70 @xmath31 in h@xmath0 , to reach @xmath71 @xmath31 in d@xmath0 .",
    "that sequence clearly indicates that the main influence in @xmath60 comes from the potential , since the isotopic change varies the location of the energy minimum less than 15 % .",
    "most probably , the features observed in these systems have a more general character and one can guess that if the well of the interatomic potential is increased and/or the mass of the particle adsorbed inside a tube is enlarged , the effect would be an increase in the @xmath60 value .    in fig .",
    "4 , the density dependence of the pressure for both 1d d@xmath0 and d@xmath0 inside the tube is reported from the equilibrium density up to 0.30 @xmath31 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the same results for h@xmath0 are also plotted . in both h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 ,",
    "the pressures for the 1d systems ( solid lines ) are greater than the ones for the tubes ( dashed lines ) at the same @xmath29 , the difference being quite similar for the two isotopes . for the same geometry and at equal density ,",
    "the pressure of h@xmath0 is always larger , a fact that is basically due to its slightly smaller equilibrium density .",
    "complementary and useful information on the system can be obtained from the microscopic study of the spatial structure of the molecules in the array . in fig .",
    "5 the radial distribution functions , @xmath72 , along the @xmath73 axis , are shown .",
    "they correspond to the quantum fluids adsorbed in the tube at their respective equilibrium densities @xmath60 .",
    "the 1d counterparts are nearly identical and are not displayed . being the denser of the three systems , d@xmath0 exhibits accordingly the most pronounced oscillations in the @xmath72 function .",
    "the shift in the positions of the maxima for the two molecular isotopes arises basically from the difference in their respective @xmath60 s .",
    "a comparison of the radial distributions of h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 at the same linear density , not shown for simplicity , indicates so . in the @xmath1he case",
    ", the much lower equilibrium density , direct consequence of the different potential , explains the smoothness of the @xmath72 obtained .",
    "the radial densities inside the ( 5,5 ) tube have been also studied . in fig .",
    "6 , the radial densities for @xmath1he , h@xmath0 , and d@xmath0 for the same linear density @xmath29 = 0.245 @xmath31 are shown .",
    "the trends shown in the figure are common to all densities studied : the particle with the largest mass ( d@xmath0 ) is the one which spends more time in regions closer to the center of the tube , i.e. , d@xmath0 in the tube is the closest to a one - dimensional system .",
    "the change in the mass and in the interatomic potential work in the same direction : the radial densities of h@xmath0 and @xmath1he are quite similar .",
    "both curves show a decrease in the radial localization and larger fluctuations in the transverse direction .      the absorption of different species inside the interstitial channels of bundles , formed when",
    "several nanotubes are staked together , has been theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally observed.@xcite the staking of the nanotubes allows for the formation of an hexagonal network of quasi - one dimensional channels separated by distances which depend on the diameter of the nanotubes themselves .",
    "for instance , when the nanotube ropes are made out of ( 5,5 ) constituents , the distance between two adjacent tubes is 10.26  , whereas the closest interstitial channels are located @xmath74   apart .",
    "the interstitial channels are very narrow , with effective diameters oscillating between 3 and 3.5  . @xcite",
    "this size is considerably smaller than the diameter ( 6.8  ) of the ( 5,5 ) tube considered in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to assume that if molecular hydrogen or deuterium is introduced inside one of this channels , its behavior would have even a more one dimensional character than in the inner part of a single tube .    considering the previous arguments , a quantum fluid adsorbed in the intersites can be well modelled by hexagonal arrangements of purely 1d systems , mutually separated by the real interchannel distance in the bundle . to a large extent ,",
    "the additional consideration of the interactions between the adsorbed atoms / molecules and the carbon atoms of the nanotube walls would simply introduce a constant shift in the energy scale .",
    "the influence of neighbouring channels in the binding energy of @xmath1he adsorbed in one of them has been estimated in ref . considering a _ mean field",
    "_ approximation . in this approach ,",
    "the neighbouring channels are seen as uniform arrays that only contribute to increase the potential energy in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance between the reference channel and one of its neighbours .",
    "the total energy correction is obtained by summing up the contribution of the nearest neighbours , the next - nearest neighbours , and then on up to a desired accuracy . from its definition ( [ mfield ] )",
    "it is clear that the energy per particle in this approximation , @xmath77 is an upper bound to the exact energy .    in order to test the _",
    "_ approximation ( [ enermf ] ) , we have performed full dmc calculations of a system formed by an hexagonal array of 1d h@xmath0 channels . since the distances between channels depend on the diameter of the tubes ,",
    "the calculations have been made in the more challenging case for eq .",
    "( [ enermf ] ) , a bundle of ( 5,5 ) nanotubes .",
    "that tube is one of the narrowest experimentally obtained , and therefore the interchannel distance is one of the smallest in nature .",
    "actually , that is an unrealistic case since the corresponding interstitial channels are too narrow to adsorb h@xmath0 .",
    "the dmc energies are displayed in fig .",
    "7 , and compared with the approximated estimations ( [ enermf ] ) . as it is evident in the figure , both results are nearly identical , at least in the density range considered . the conclusion is that correlations between hydrogen molecules located in different channels suppose a negligible contribution to the energy , even in this case where the channels are very close .",
    "7 , there is also reported the equation of state of 1d h@xmath0 .",
    "as one can see , the increase of the binding energy of the system , when the array is immersed in a bundle , is as large as a factor two .",
    "having checked the validity of the _ mean field _",
    "approach ( [ enermf ] ) in an exigent case , one can use that approximation to study the equation of state of molecular hydrogen and helium adsorbed in other more appropriate bundles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the number of neighbours to be included in @xmath78 has to be larger than ten , otherwise the binding energy is underestimated in a 5 % .",
    "besides the ( 5,5 ) bundle , with an interchannel distance @xmath79  , we have analyzed the following cases : ( 6,6 ) , @xmath80  ; ( 8,8 ) , @xmath81  ; ( 10,10 ) , @xmath82  .",
    "the fluids that have been analyzed are @xmath1he , d@xmath0 , and h@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "8 , the differences between the equilibrium density in the bundles and in the purely 1d system are shown for the three cases .",
    "there is a clear difference ( an order of magnitude ) between the increase of @xmath60 , when @xmath1he is adsorbed in the intersites , and the density shift experimented by the two hydrogen isotopes . in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0",
    "the change in density is small but one can distinguish a slightly larger effect in the lighter isotope . in all cases ,",
    "the density difference decreases when the interchannel separation increases .",
    "however , h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 have already reached the 1d equilibrium density in the ( 10,10 ) geometry whereas @xmath1he still shows a sizeable effect .",
    "the increase of the binding energies with respect to the one - dimensional systems are reported in fig .",
    "the different points correspond to the same bundles reported in fig .",
    "8 . in absolute terms",
    ", that increase is much larger in molecular hydrogen than in @xmath1he , the effect being slightly larger in d@xmath0 than in h@xmath0 for all the bundles .",
    "the energy difference between h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 is very small and decreases when the interchannel distance increases .",
    "it is clear , from the _ mean field _",
    "correction ( [ mfield ] ) , that the difference in energy between the two isotopes arises from their different densities since the interatomic potential is the same .",
    "in @xmath1he the shift in energy is comparatively small but , taking into account that the 1d @xmath1he binding energy@xcite is only @xmath83 k , one concludes that the bundle effects are much larger in @xmath1he than in molecular hydrogen .",
    "in this work , we have studied the zero - temperature equation of state of molecular deuterium , and compared the results with those previously obtained@xcite for @xmath1he and molecular hydrogen.@xcite the results show that the different masses of the two isotopes do influence both the energetic and structural properties . as a general trend",
    ", d@xmath0 appears as a slightly denser liquid , a fact that is observed in its equation of state and also in the radial distribution functions .",
    "the comparison between d@xmath0 and @xmath1he , two _",
    "particles _ with the same mass but with very different interatomic potentials , has shed light on the influence of the potential in one - dimensional systems . concerning the mass and potential changes , the dmc results show unambiguously that the potential effects are manifestly dominant .",
    "bundles of carbon nanotubes have also been studied by modelling them as hexagonal one - dimensional arrays .",
    "the explicit dmc calculation of the system has allowed to check the accuracy of a previously suggested _ mean field _",
    "approximation.@xcite once verified the validity of that approximation , we have analyzed the effects of the neighbouring channels on the 1d equation of state .",
    "our results show that those effects are much more relevant in @xmath1he than in molecular hydrogen .    in the tube and bundle calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the interparticle potential is not modified by the existence of nearby carbon atoms .",
    "recently , cole and coworkers@xcite have estimated the effective correction in the two - body potential due to three - body interactions between two particles and the carbon atoms of the nanotube wall .",
    "this three - body interaction has been modelled by the well - known triple - dipole interaction derived by axilrod and teller,@xcite a potential energy contribution that is mostly repulsive . in the case of molecular hydrogen in the interstitial channels , the well of the effective silvera and goldman potential is reduced by approximately a factor two .",
    "this unexpected and big effect would modify some of the results presented in our work .",
    "nevertheless , it is well - known that , in spite of the fact that axilrod - teller is the dominant contribution to @xmath84 , at short interparticle distances an attractive force emerges .",
    "this short - ranged three - body interaction , known as exchange interaction,@xcite is due to the influence of a third particle in the charge densities of two interacting atoms . due to",
    "the short interparticle distances h@xmath0-c - h@xmath0 in the channel , that attractive term would partially cancel the repulsion introduced by axilrod - teller .",
    "we have preferred to ignore the three - body corrections@xcite until a better knowledge of the nonadditive terms of this particular system is achieved .",
    "we plan , in the near future , to introduce in the simulation the possibility of the swelling of the channels when molecular hydrogen is adsorbed . the aim would be to test , by a microscopic calculation , the recent theoretical result@xcite that h@xmath0 forces the nanotube bundles to slightly spread upon adsorption .",
    "we hope our calculations , and the ones carried out by other theoretical groups , can stimulate new experiments on molecular hydrogen adsorption in carbon nanotubes and bundles , especially at low - temperature where quantum effects become macroscopic .",
