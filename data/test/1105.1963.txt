    "thus the existence of dagns in the universe and their demography provide an important probe not only of the hierarchical galaxy formation models but also of the triggering mechanisms of nuclear activities and the assembly history of mbhs .    in the past decade",

    "* ) . following a systematic scrutiny of the nir images and optical slit spectra of a sample of double - peaked narrow line type 2 agns , it has recently been reported that roughly 0.5%-2.5% of the @xmath2 type 2 agns are kpc - scale dagns after taking into account the selection completeness ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "this frequency is surprisingly low even if we were to assume that all these observations are indeed of dagns and not as has been otherwise suggested of superposed single agns , bipolar jets and accretion disks .",

    "the low frequency of dagns , unlikely due to selection effect @xcite , seems generally at odds with the commonly accepted scenario that agn / qso activities are triggered by major mergers of galaxies .    in this paper",

    "when their companion galaxies are sufficiently close to them , the dagn frequency and their separation distribution are obtained in section  [ sec : results ] . by comparison with observations",

    "we further discuss the uncertainties in our estimates of the dagn frequency due to different processes , which are not included in our model , such as mergers of progenitor galaxies whose nuclei have already been activated in previous mergers and also tidally - induced nuclear activities in two galaxies which are still far away from each other .",

    "this ratio is equal to the ratio of the cumulative lf of dagns to that of agns , and depends weakly on the lower limit of the agn luminosities .",
    "these estimates could be off by a factor of @xmath159 as previously discussed . at redshift @xmath161 ,",
    "the estimated dagn frequency is @xmath1 .",
    "( this value could be higher than the estimates from observed dagns selected through the double - peaked narrow lines , considering that the signal - to - noise of some dagn spectra are so low that the dagns are not detected observationally .",
    ") there are quite a number of dagns which can not be detected by using double - peaked narrow lines , due to the projection effect and the velocity cutoff . including the undetected dagns",
    ", our model suggests that the real frequency of dagns is @xmath162 , larger than that of those dagns selected through the double - peaked narrow line features by a factor of @xmath163 . these values are fully consistent with the observational estimates obtained by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath164 without completeness correction or @xmath165 after the correction of in - completeness due to the projection effect , velocity cutoff and low signal - to - noise spectra of some dagns ( see also @xcite , in which the dagn frequency is @xmath166 without the completeness correction ) .",
    "the reasons that a lower frequency of dagns is obtained from our model ( compared to the simple estimates ; e.g. , @xmath167 by @xcite ) are three folds : ( 1 ) dagns can be produced only if both of the two progenitor galaxies are gas rich so that sufficient accretion materials could be provided ; ( 2 ) mbhs in those gas - rich progenitor galaxies may be initially substantially smaller than their final masses , and thus the agn phenomena triggered before mbh mergers may be substantially less luminous compared with those triggered after mbh mergers ; and ( 3 ) in a significant fraction of major mergers , the masses of the mbhs hosted in the two progenitor galaxies may differ by a large factor and thus the induced dagns may have too large luminosity difference to be included .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] , the modeled frequency of kpc - scale dagns that can be detected through the double - peaked narrow line features declines to even lower values on the order of several ten - thousandths , e.g. , @xmath168 at redshift @xmath169 .",
    "and the frequency of all kpc - scale dagns declines to @xmath170 at redshift @xmath169 .",
    "this decline is mainly due to the redshift evolution of the galaxy morphology distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "correspondingly , the major mergers at such redshifts are dominated by very late - type galaxies ( e.g. , sc - sd and irr galaxies ) and the fraction of mergers that host large initial mbhs becomes substantially smaller at high redshifts .",
    "future observations which would specifically search for high redshift dagns could test this prediction .",
    "in addition , we note here that the estimates of the dagn lf and the separation distribution may be affected by some simplified assumptions made above .",
    "below we discuss how our results would be affected by some other mechanisms , which may trigger nuclear activities , but is ignored in the model above .",
    "first , we have explicitly assumed that significant nuclear activities can only be triggered in the gas - rich component of a major merger .",
    "if we relax this assumption and allow significant nuclear activities to be triggered in the gas - poor component of a major merger , then the estimated dagn frequency would rise to about ten percent or higher at luminosity @xmath105}\\ga 10^{8.5}l\\sun$ ] , but is not affected much at lower luminosities . under this assumption , the dagns at the high - luminosity end are primarily formed by major mergers of two red progenitor galaxies as the initial mbhs in red galaxies are substantially big compared to those in blue galaxies with similar total stellar masses .",
    "mixed mergers of a red progenitor galaxy with a blue progenitor galaxy contribute little to the population of dagns with comparable luminosities , as the masses of the initial mbhs in these two progenitor galaxies are less likely to be comparable .",
    "second , a dagn can also be produced at larger separations if nuclear activities could be triggered by tidal interactions when the two progenitor galaxies of a major merger are still far away from each other . under this assumption , the model described in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "can still be used but a large value of @xmath63 should be chosen ( e.g. , @xmath171 ) . by assuming @xmath171 and a constant eddington ratio @xmath99 till the completion of the mergers , our estimate of the frequency of kpc - scale dagns increases to @xmath172 .",
    "this increase is clearly because most of the mbhs in the progenitor galaxies could now grow up significantly before the separation of the two components of a dagn decays to the kpc scale .",
    "however , increasing the value of the @xmath63 parameter to @xmath173 also implied that the predicted number of agn pairs on scale of @xmath174 from our model is comparable to the total number of agns at luminosity @xmath105}\\ga 10^{7}l\\sun$ ] , which is not consistent with current observations .",
    "one possible way to solve this inconsistency would be to impose that tidal interactions induce only low - level nuclear activities ( e.g. , with @xmath175 ) when the two progenitor galaxies are still far away from each other and the accretion rate is significantly enhanced only when the two progenitor galaxies become close enough to each other . in this case , a large number of paired agns on @xmath176 ( with a frequency of several percent to ten percent ) can be produced but the resulted frequency of dagns on kpc - scale is still the same as the current observations suggest .",
    "third , successive mergers , in principle , can include mergers of two progenitor galaxies whose nuclei have already been activated , which would also yield a dagn .",
    "this scenario has not been discussed here in details mainly for simplicity . however , according to the major merger rates of galaxies presented in section  [ sec : model ] , the rate of successive major mergers , within the lifetime of detectable nuclear activities ( e.g. , @xmath177 ) , is extremely low , especially if successive merger events were assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "future observations which would determine the distribution of dagns as a function of luminosity and separation may shed light on our understanding of the triggering mechanisms , major mergers , tidal interactions and the mergers of galaxies with already - activated nuclei .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed a phenomenological model to estimate the number density of dagns and its evolution according to the observationally - estimated merger rates of galaxies and various scaling relations on the properties of galaxies and massive black holes .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observed frequency and separation distribution of dagns are compatible with the hypothesis that major mergers of galaxies lead to agn / qso activities and are consistent with most estimates of galaxy major merger rates .",
    "we have also predicted that the frequency of those dual agns with double - peaked narrow line features becomes even smaller ( i.e. , @xmath168 ) at higher redshifts @xmath178 and the frequency of all kpc - scale dagns is @xmath179 at @xmath169 , which can be tested by future observations .",
    "future observations shall provide us with much better statistics on the distribution of kpc - scale dagns ( and pairs of agns on even larger scale ) as a function of luminosity and separation and hence will tighten the constraints on triggering mechanisms of nuclear activities .",
