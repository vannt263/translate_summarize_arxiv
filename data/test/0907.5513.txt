    "the simultaneous treatment of disorder and interactions in strongly correlated electron systems has always formed a knotty challenge ; this is because of the dearth of manageable analytical techniques that can deal with disorder and interactions at the same time.@xcite the strongly correlated system of interest in this work is the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a perpendicular magnetic field at landau level filling factor @xmath0 , whose ground state is commonly known as the _ quantum hall ferromagnet_.    the quantum hall ferromagnet is the spin - polarized ground state of the 2deg at @xmath0 in which all electrons completely fill the lowest landau level with spin up polarization .",
    "such configuration minimizes the coulomb energy for fermionic systems . in general , it is a competition between kinetic and coulomb energies , which determines the ground state . in the case of the quantum hall ferromagnet",
    "having @xmath0 the kinetic energy is frozen and does not change with spin flip , thus , the ground state is ferromagnetic , even with zero zeeman splitting .",
    "typically , the zeeman splitting in the gaas heterojunctions turns out to be roughly 70 times smaller than the spacing between landau levels and an order of magnitude smaller than the coulomb energy per particle .",
    "the neutral elementary excitations are spin wave excitations , also called magnons .",
    "the spin waves can be described by the action of the spin lowering operator @xmath1 , projected to the lowest landau level , on the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "it turns out , that the projected operator creates an exact excited eigenstate of the hamiltonian . in the regime of low momenta ,",
    "the magnon s dispersion is quadratic and the coefficient of the quadratic term represents a phenomenological constant known as the _ spin stiffness_. the spin stiffness provides a measure of the free - energy increment associated with twisting the direction of the spins .",
    "a significant spin stiffness indicates that the system lies in the ferromagnetic phase , while a paramagnetic state corresponds to a vanishing spin stiffness . the spin wave dispersion at very large momenta saturates at a constant value given by the sum of the coulomb and zeeman energies .",
    "thus , at large momenta , the value corresponds to the energy of separate quasiparticle and quasihole excitations .",
    "one approach that has successfully dealt with strongly correlated electron systems is the so - called _ bosonization _ procedure .",
    "bosonization is a non - perturbative approximation scheme that essentially treats the electron - hole excitation , known as _ exciton _",
    ", as a bosonic single - particle ; consequently , a fermionic hamiltonian can be recast into a bosonic one . in 1950 , tomonaga revealed , in a ground - breaking paper,@xcite that the application of the bosonization formalism to a one - dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) yielded an exactly - solvable hamiltonian .",
    "the reason is that the electron and the hole propagate with nearly the same group velocity in the low - energy region .",
    "however , that is not the case in two dimensions . at a given momentum @xmath2 , the particle - hole pair excitation holds a continuous range of energies .",
    "therefore , it is less straightforward to construct a coherently propagating bosonic entity in two dimensions .",
    "the first attempt to extend the bosonization procedure for higher dimensions was done by luther @xcite and then revised by haldane.@xcite castro neto and fradkin,@xcite as well as houghton and marston,@xcite developed a bosonization technique for a fermi liquid in any number of dimensions . as regards the interacting 2deg subject to an external perpendicular magnetic field , westfahl jr . _ _ et al.__@xcite constructed a formalism that treated the elementary neutral excitations of the system , the _ magnons _ , in a bosonic framework such that the fermionic hamiltonian of the system was transmuted into a quadratic bosonic hamiltonian .",
    "the drawback is that this method is valid in the limit of weak magnetic fields , which amounts to large landau level filling factors @xmath3 .",
    "doretto _ _ et al.__@xcite extended the methodology of westfahl jr . _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite to the case of the 2deg at @xmath0 ( i.e. for a very strong magnetic field ) .",
    "given that the system is now restricted to one landau level , the task greatly simplifies , since the landau level quantum degree of freedom can then be disregarded . projecting the original fermionic interacting hamiltonian of the system into the lowest landau level , which is completely filled ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "allows one to expand it in magnon states.@xcite it then turns out remarkably that the dispersion relation of the free magnons coincides with the result derived by kallin and halperin@xcite within the fermionic description at the _ random phase approximation _",
    "( rpa ) level and the quartic interacting part of the magnon hamiltonian might be related to the skyrmion - antiskyrmion neutral excitations of the hall ferromagnet.@xcite moreover , in the vicinity of the ground state , without magnon - magnon interactions , magnons behave like bosons .",
    "this allows to treat magnons approximately as bosons in the so - called single - mode approximation .",
    "@xcite here , we intend to calculate a quantum phase transition in the quantum hall ferromagnet driven by disorder , accounting for the coulomb interactions between electrons .",
    "we will use the bosonization technique allied to the usual self - consistent born - approximation for the disorder averaging procedure .    before presenting the results obtained in this paper ,",
    "it is worth getting acquainted with the current status of research related to the field . to begin with",
    ", green @xcite propounded that the vanishing of the renormalized spin stiffness at a threshold value of the disorder strength signifies the occurrence of a depolarization transition from the ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic one .",
    "his finding is based upon a previous result established by fogler and shklovskii , @xcite who proffered the same idea in the case of higher landau levels .",
    "green established this proposition in the framework of non - linear sigma model , used as an effective low - energy theory in the regime of weak disorder .",
    "the other quantity that green computed is the disorder contribution to the optical conductivity , which he found to be unmeasurably small .",
    "finally , green established that the quantization of the hall conductivity is not affected by the presence of weak disorder in the system.@xcite    another work was carried out by sinova , macdonald and girvin,@xcite who established the occurrence of a phase transition from the paramagnetic state to the partially - polarized ferromagnetic one and then finally to the fully - polarized ferromagnetic one as the interaction strength increases relative to the disorder strength .",
    "they determined this result by computing the average value of the spin polarization as a function of the interaction strength relative to the disorder strength .",
    "et al.__@xcite did consider coulomb interactions within the framework of the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "moreover , the transition from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic one was found to take place when the coulomb energy scale is about twice as large as the landau - level - broadening disorder energy scale . as a final point",
    ", the authors inferred that no phase transition can take place in the strong disorder limit .",
    "the last germane paper was published by rapsch , lee and chalker.@xcite they established the occurrence of a phase transition from the ferromagnetic state to the so - called spin glass phase .",
    "this result was obtained by calculating the magnetization , the magnetic susceptibility and the spin stiffness as functions of the disorder strength .",
    "they assumed the disorder potential to be gaussian distributed and described the system in terms of a _ semiclassical _ spin model . in their model , they took into account coulomb interactions within the hartree - fock approximation but modelled them as being short - ranged . like green,@xcite rapsch",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite computed the disorder contribution to the optical conductivity and found as well that it is undetectable . finally , they calculated the dielectric susceptibility of both the partially - polarized ferromagnetic phase and the spin glass one and they concluded that both regimes display an insulating behavior at low momenta and a metallic behavior at large momenta .",
    "let us now put our work in perspective .",
    "our objective is to establish the behavior of the renormalized spin stiffness as a function of the disorder strength in order to ascertain a potential quantum phase transition driven by disorder to a non - ferromagnetic state . indeed ,",
    "if the spin stiffness vanishes for a critical value of the disorder strength , then this signals an instability in the ferromagnetic phase.@xcite on the other hand , the appearance of an imaginary component of the spin stiffness , which might be interpreted as a spin wave damping,@xcite at a certain disorder strength , might indicate the appearance of localized spin waves and a spin - glass phase transition .",
    "another important characteristic is the pauli susceptibility , which diverges at the point of the phase transition from a non - ferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state , indicating spontaneous magnetization .",
    "we consider a fully _ quantum _ model , include a short - range weak disorder potential up to the @xmath4 order born approximation and treat the true _ long - range coulomb _",
    "interactions up to the rpa level .",
    "the method that we employ consists of five steps .",
    "first of all , a bosonized expression of the total hamiltonian , which includes a contribution from disorder , is sought for .",
    "the dispersion relation of the free bosons corresponds to the one computed by macdonald _",
    "_ @xcite and more explicitly by doretto _ et al._,@xcite which entails interactions between electrons up to the rpa level .",
    "the second step consists in obtaining the full green s function , and precisely its disorder self - average . in our case , because the impurities are randomly distributed throughout the system , the disorder self - average can also be taken by averaging over the impurity positions .",
    "the third stage is then to determine the self - energy of that disorder self - averaged green s function through the use of the dyson s equation .",
    "the self - energy is determined in the low - impurity density and weak disorder scattering approximations . as a result",
    ", the self - energy corresponds to a single diagram with one propagator line and two disorder potential lines .",
    "the propagator line is evaluated within two further possible approximations : the bare approximation , which consists in using the bare bosonic propagator , and the self - consistent approximation , which uses instead the full disorder self - averaged green s function .",
    "one must bear in mind that both propagators take into account interactions between electrons up to the rpa level .",
    "furthermore , the bare approximation is first taken in the long wavelength limit , which keeps the lowest order terms in momenta , and then in the general case , where all the momenta terms are taken into account .",
    "the fourth step consists in obtaining the renormalized dispersion in these approximations : bare and self - consistent approximations .",
    "the final stage is then to determine the spin stiffness in the approximations by taking the coefficient of the quadratic term in the renormalized dispersion .",
    "it is found that a naive extrapolation of the bare approximation to the regime of finite disorder strength predicts vanishing of the renormalized spin stiffness at a certain disorder strength @xmath5 , indicating a paramagnetic phase transition .",
    "a more realistic self - consistent approximation , however , predicts even faster decrease of the renormalized spin stiffness with growing disorder strength up to a certain critical value @xmath6 of the disorder . at this point",
    ", the renormalized spin stiffness drastically changes its behavior : it becomes nonanalytic , acquires an imaginary part , and the real part saturates at a certain positive value without reaching zero . such nonanalytic behavior can not be accessed by any finite number of perturbative corrections .",
    "in addition , our calculations show a strong indication that the pauli susceptibility also diverges at the same critical point @xmath6 , suggesting a phase transition , presumably to a spin glass phase .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section ii we present the model and in section iii we derive the expression for the self - energy .",
    "then , we first solve the problem using the bare green s function in section iv .",
    "we present our numerical and analytical results for the self - consistent solution of the dyson equations in section v and draw our conclusions in section vi .",
    "the 2deg in the presence of both a perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath0 and disorder is described by the fermionic hamiltonian @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the fermionic creation and annihilation operators in coordinate space , @xmath13 denotes the effective mass of the electron , @xmath14 is the vector potential , @xmath15 stands for the effective land @xmath16-factor and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton .",

    "the first step consists in obtaining a @xmath4 quantized version of the magnon hamiltonian of the system . in our model",
    "we consider only single magnon processes , which allow us to use a bosonic description .",
    "it was shown in ref .",

    "it must be stressed that although the interaction between magnons is omitted from the discussion , the coulomb interaction between electrons up to rpa level is taken into account by the bosonic dispersion relation @xmath31.@xcite    we now focus on the impurity part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we begin with the fermionic expression of the @xmath4 quantized impurity hamiltonian , @xmath32 here , @xmath33 denotes the fourier transformed density function @xmath34 for the impurities and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the fermionic creation and annihilation operators in @xmath25 space . in order to obtain the bosonic form of the above",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) back into eq.([arshavin2 ] ) yields @xmath41 the bosonized version of the electron density operator reads @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the landau level degeneracy and @xmath44 .",

    "the bosonized impurity hamiltonian is then finally written as @xmath47 where @xmath48    labelling @xmath49 the full bosonized hamiltonian of the quantum hall ferromagnet in the presence of impurities is then expressed as @xmath50    let us now say a few words on the dimensions of the disorder potential .",
    "there are two sources of disorder present in the system : impurities positioned at a certain distance away from the 2deg and impurities present in the 2deg . in the case of gaas heterostructures , @xcite most of the disorder potential",
    "is spawned by the coulomb interaction between the electrons and the impurities located away from the 2deg .",
    "these impurities correspond to ionized donor atoms situated in the @xmath51-type region , which itself is detached from the 2deg by an insulating layer of thickness @xmath52 . in the present calculations",
    ", the disorder potential will be taken as an effective two - dimensional potential .",
    "having obtained the bosonized hamiltonian in the presence of impurities , one is now able to determine the expression for the self - energy .",

    "now , using eq.([arda1 ] ) , one easily finds that @xmath58 = \\omega_{\\textbf{p } } b_{\\textbf{p } } ( t ) + \\sum_{\\textbf{q } } u^{e } ( \\textbf{q } , \\textbf{p } - \\textbf{q } ) g_{\\textbf{q } } b_{\\textbf{p } - \\textbf{q } } ( t),\\ ] ] such that one obtains for the second term in eq.([arda2 ] ) @xmath59b^{\\dagger}_{\\textbf{p } ' } ( 0 ) \\right ] | 0 \\rangle = \\omega_{\\textbf{p } } g ( \\textbf{p } ' , \\textbf{p};t ) \\\\ & + \\sum_{\\textbf{q } } u^{e}(\\textbf{q } , \\textbf{p } - \\textbf{q } ) g_{\\textbf{q } } g ( \\textbf{p } ' , \\textbf{p } - \\textbf{q};t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the equation of motion of @xmath60 is written as @xmath61    the zero - order approximation to the solution of eq.([arda2bis ] ) yields @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the bare bosonic green s function .",
    "we now look for the expression for @xmath63 .",
    "firstly , one needs to find the heisenberg bosonic operator in the absence of the disorder potential .",
    "starting with @xmath64 = \\omega_{\\textbf{p } } b_{\\textbf{p } } ( t ) $ ] , one then obtains @xmath65 . therefore , for the case @xmath66 , the free green s function is @xmath67 whereas for @xmath68 , it turns out to be @xmath69 this solution is indeed identical to the electronic one .",
    "now , the cynosure is on the generic solution of the differential equation ( [ arda2bis ] ) . by coupling the latter with the boundary equation ( [ arda3 ] ) yields the integral equation @xmath70 by fourier - transforming the time in eq . to frequency and shifting @xmath71 one finds @xmath72 here , the bare green s function reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is given by eq .. in the same way as for fermions , the solution of eq.([arda5 ] ) is obtained by iteration .",
    "one gets the so - called _ born series _ : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and for @xmath78 , @xmath79 expansion of eq.([saqibismyfriend1 ] ) then yields    @xmath80    due to disorder self - averaging in the limit of very large number of impurities @xmath81 , with constant density @xmath82 , the full bosonic one - particle green s function approaches its average value @xmath83 which is @xmath84 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath85 : @xmath86 moreover , one has @xmath87 substituting eqs . and eq.([firstorder ] ) into the expression for @xmath88 shows that the translational invariance is recovered after the averaging @xmath89 , where @xmath90 therefore , there is no @xmath91 order born scattering contribution to the bosonic self - energy .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that all odd order contributions to the self - energy vanish ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this result is expressed diagrammatically in fig.[diaag9 ] .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the disorder averaged green s function can also be expressed as @xmath92    hence , the self - energy must now be computed .",
    "the low - density weak scattering approximation will be used throughout the calculations .",
    "low density means that the number of disorder atoms present in the system is taken to be much lower than the number of electrons , while the weak - scattering approximation signifies that the scattering potential induced by a given impurity atom is weak , such that only the first and second - order born scatterings are accounted for .",
    "the problem then reduces to solving the diagrammatic expression shown in fig.[diaag10 ] .",
    "the self - energy can be evaluated in two different manners : 1 ) the bare approximation that uses the bare propagator @xmath93 and 2 ) the self - consistent approximation that uses the full disorder self - averaged green s function @xmath94 . therefore , for generality we will use the propagator @xmath95 , which is going to be specified further for each particular case .",
    "this yields algebraically    @xmath96    where eq.([qzdr1 ] ) was substituted in the second line .    in this work , the impurity potential is assumed to be short - range , i.e. @xmath97 .",
    "an uniform potential in momentum space is attained from a delta function interaction in real space , @xmath98 ( such that @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , this model assumes that the bosons ( and therefore the electrons ) collide directly with the impurity atoms that constitute the effective disorder potential ; in reality , most of the impurities are located away from the 2deg .",

    "the real part of @xmath199 is proportional to the spin wave stiffness , whereas the imaginary part is proportional to the damping of the spin wave excitations , thus signalling localization .",

    "this paper accounts for the presence of both disorder and interactions in a 2deg at landau level filling factor @xmath0 , whose ground state constitutes the well - known quantum hall ferromagnet . the bosonization technique developed by doretto",
    "@xcite was employed in order to facilitate the treatment of both disorder and interactions in this strongly correlated system .",
    "the bosonization procedure consists in treating the spin wave ( magnon ) excitation as a boson such that the fermionic hamiltonian of the system can be approximately recast into a hamiltonian expressed in terms of bosonic operators . as a consequence",
    ", the interaction between electrons up to rpa level was incorporated within the bare propagator that represents the free boson .",
    "the intent was then to identify a disorder - driven quantum phase transition to a non - ferromagnetic state by analyzing the behavior of the renormalized spin stiffness as a function of the disorder strength , which itself corresponds to the ratio squared of the disorder energy scale to the coulomb energy one . to achieve this aim ,",
    "firstly , we derived the bosonic expression for the hamiltonian of the system . in the second stage ,",
    "the focus was on seeking out the disorder self - averaged green s function , which is the full bosonic green s function averaged over the impurity positions .",
    "then , by using the dyson s equation , we obtained a diagrammatic representation of the self - energy .",
    "the latter was subsequently computed within the framework of the low - density weak - scattering approximation .",
    "low density means that the number of disorder atoms present in the system is taken to be much lower than the number of electrons , while the weak - scattering approximation signifies that the scattering potential induced by a given impurity atom is weak , such that only the first and second - order born scatterings are accounted for . as a result , the self - energy corresponded to a single diagram .",
    "furthermore , the self - energy was evaluated in three different approximations : 1 ) the bare ( long wavelength ) approximation , which consists in using the bare bosonic propagator and keeping the lowest order terms in momenta , 2 ) the bare ( full @xmath2 ) approximation , which uses as well the bare bosonic propagator but with all the momenta terms kept in the calculation and , finally , 3 ) the self - consistent approximation , which uses the full disorder averaged green s function instead of the bare one in the self - energy diagram .",
    "then , the renormalized spin stiffness was determined by extracting the coefficient of the quadratic term in the dispersion relation together with the contribution from the self - energy . in the case of the bare ( long wavelength ) approximation ,",
    "the spin stiffness was found to vanish linearly at the disorder strength @xmath136 .",
    "for the bare ( full @xmath2 ) scheme , the spin stiffness also vanished linearly , but at the disorder strength @xmath137 .",
    "these results suggest the occurrence of a disorder - driven quantum phase transition from the ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic one at the critical value @xmath137 .",
    "lastly , the self - consistent calculation revealed a completely different behavior : the real part of the renormalized spin stiffness also initially decreases with increasing the disorder strength @xmath115 , but then it saturates without reaching zero beyond a critical value @xmath6 , at which it ( and the self - energy ) acquires an imaginary component .",
    "according to the shender criterium,@xcite the spin waves become completely localized when the imaginary part of the renormalized spin stiffness becomes larger than the real part , which occurs in our system for @xmath208 ( see fig.[scottmurray5 ] ) .",
    "the physical mechanism behind a phase transition from the ferromagnetic ground state can be understood by considering electrons completely filling the lowest landau level ( @xmath0 ) in the presence of some inhomogeneous electrostatic background ( disorder ) .",
    "then , for sufficiently strong impurity potential , by adjusting the electron density to the electrostatic background , the system would gain more energy than is needed to rearrange the spin configuration . in this case",
    "the ferromagnetic state does not minimize the total energy of the system and a phase transition should take place . this quantum phase transition could be detected by calculating the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility as a function of the disorder strength .",
    "a sharp peak is anticipated at the transition point .",
    "in particular , if the energy cost for exciting a spin wave is less than the gain in the electrostatic energy , then the renormalized spin stiffness becomes negative and the system undergoes a phase transition to a paramagnetic state with zero local magnetization .",
    "on the other hand , as it was argued by rapsch _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite in the case of a smoothly varying impurity potential , keeping nonzero local magnetization is still energetically favorable and the electrostatic energy is lowered by screening the impurity potential due to the formation of spin textures . at strong disorder",
    "such phase would correspond to a spin glass and the spin textures might be considered as the localized spin waves .",
    "thus , the character of the phase transition might depend on the nature of the disorder .",
    "the calculations performed within our model indicate that the pauli susceptibility diverges at the same critical point of the disorder strength @xmath6 , where an imaginary part of the renormalized spin stiffness appears , thus suggesting a phase transition to a spin glass phase .",
    "our approach can be extended for the case of bilayer systems in the presence of disorder .",
    "in fact , fertig and murthy @xcite have already considered such systems .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to apply our formalism to the case of a bilayer system with the total filling factor @xmath209 and compare the results .",
    "we acknowledge insightful discussions with t.  giamarchi and l.cugliandolo .",
    "we also would like to thank r.  l.  doretto for proposing us this interesting problem .",
    "this work was partially supported by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .",
    "let us now evaluate the @xmath210 order diagram contribution to the self - energy .",
