    "cyg x-1 is a persistent x - ray source believed to be powered by accretion onto a black hole from a massive companion . most of the time cyg  x-1 spends in the hard state and sometimes it switches to the soft state ( see , e.g. , liang & nolan 1984 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; poutanen 1998 ; gierliski et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity above @xmath2 is estimated to be about @xmath3 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) , assuming the distance to the source , @xmath4 ( massey , johnson , & degioia - eastwood 1995 ; malysheva 1997 ) .",
    "variability of cyg x-1 was extensively studied with various instruments ( see , e.g. , ling et al .",

    "these studies show the stability of the hard state of cyg  x-1 .",
    "the photon flux above 50 kev is normally @xmath5 with variations by a factor  2 .    in this letter , we analyze the period of the unusually strong hard x - ray activity of cyg x-1 on 1999 april  21 .",
    "two strong outbursts activated the batse/_cgro _",
    "( fishman et al . 1989 ) onboard trigger .",
    "we analyze the temporal structure of the outbursts in the four lad energy channels 14 , estimate the peak luminosity of cyg x-1 , and discuss possible implications for theoretical models of accretion in this object .",
    "the unusual activity of cyg x-1 can be traced back to 1999 april  19 ( tjd 11287 ) .",
    "two events recorded on april  19 were found in the batse data during search for non - triggered gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( stern et al .",
    "1999 , 2000a ) .",
    "the best fit locations were within @xmath6 from cyg x-1 ( @xmath7 errors exceeded @xmath8 for those events ) .",
    "we use the location procedure described in stern et al .",
    "( 2000b ) which is similar to that used for grb location by pendleton et al .",
    "the estimated peak fluxes above 50  kev were about 0.3 and @xmath9 which is high as compared with the normal flux from cyg x-1 .",
    "on april  20 , batse detectors were triggered by another event with right ascension , @xmath10 , and declination , @xmath11 ( batse estimate , note also that this event is identified as a grb in the batse data base ) .",
    "again , the location was close to cyg x-1 ( slightly beyond 1@xmath12 error circle ) . and @xmath13 .",
    "] the peak flux of this event was about @xmath14 .",
    "on april  21 , the two brightest outbursts occurred , with the interval @xmath15 hours . between and after the two outbursts , cyg x-1 demonstrated nothing unusual , being in the hard state with normal luminosity .",
    "the summary of all the five events is given in table  1 .",
    "we will concentrate on the two brightest events on april  21 ( two last lines in table  1 ) .",
    "the locations of both events coincide with the location of cyg x-1 with 2@xmath16 accuracy . in principle",
    ", it might be accidental projections of grbs on cyg x-1 .",
    "the probability that one of @xmath17 detected grbs with comparable brightness will appear within 2@xmath16 from cyg x-1 is about 0.3 .",
    "however , the probability of appearance of two such grbs from the same location within 2.5 hours is low , @xmath18 .",
    "besides , the long duration of the events , @xmath19  s , is very unusual for grbs .",
    "one concludes that the events are outbursts of cyg x-1 .",
    "table 1 + summary of outbursts on 1999 april 19 - 21    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we then compute the cross - correlation coefficient between channels 2 and 3 , @xmath20 ) ( see table  4 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation decreases during the outbursts and becomes very low in interval e. it confirms that the soft component gets so soft that it practically does not contribute to the signal in channel  3 . in interval f ,",
    "the cross - correlation is high , confirming that the soft component has disappeared and we see only the second ( hard ) component in all the three channels .",
    "the luminosities of the soft and hard components can be roughly estimated from the step - like cut offs at 64.05  ks and 64.1  ks , respectively .",
    "the average luminosity of cyg  x-1 in time interval e above 50  kev ( 30  kev ) is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) in the soft component and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) in the hard component .",
    "the normal hard state of cyg x-1 was studied using the earth occultations which occur on each orbit of the _ cgro_. the step in the light curve at the moment of occultation shows the amplitude of the signal from cyg x-1 in each energy channel .",
    "the study of cyg x-1 with this method was done by ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and paciesas et al .",
    "we performed a similar analysis for @xmath25 occultations and evaluated the flux from cyg x-1 and the hardness ratio @xmath26 ( ratio of the signal count rates in channels 3 and 2 ) for each occultation .",
    "the results are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the observed large dispersion in the hardness ratio may be caused by the measurement errors rather than intrinsic variability of cyg  x-1 . to estimate the errors we did a similar analysis of 80 occultations of the crab nebula which is known to be a steady source .",
    "we found @xmath27 and the count rate @xmath28 , where the errors represent the standard deviations .",
    "the major cause of the errors is the uncertainty in the changing background ( to have good statistics one has to fit the signal on a relatively long period @xmath29 s before and after the occultation , and the background curvature plays a role ) .",
    "one should note that the error in the hardness ratio of cyg x-1 is likely to be smaller than that for the crab since its flux is larger . in the outbursts , these errors are even smaller .",
    "= 7.5 cm    for comparison we also show the estimates of the flux and hardness ratio for the two april  21 outbursts .",
    "note that outburst 11289c and interval f of outburst 11289e have hardness ratios similar to the normal hard state .",
    "interval e of outburst 11289e is significantly softer .",
    "the presence of two emission components ( soft , highly variable , and hard , with lower variability ) in outburst 11289e is intriguing .",
    "are they present in the normal state of cyg  x-1 ? in the sample of 63 occultations we found that the fractional rms of the count rate ( i.e. the ratio of the rms to the mean count rate ) in channel 2 was higher than that in channel 3 in 47 cases .",
    "this indicates higher variability in channel 2 ( the probability of such an accidental excess is @xmath30 ) .",
    "the decreasing of the variability with energy was also observed in the 240 kev band ( nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; revnivtsev et al .",
    "these facts are consistent with the presence of a hard component with a low variability though this interpretation is not unique .",
    "note also that gierliski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) got the best fit to the broad - band x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 with two thermal comptonization components of different temperatures .",
    "the hard state of cyg  x-1 has been a puzzle since its discovery .",
    "the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) was not able to explain the x - ray spectrum , and two modifications of the model were suggested : a two - temperature hot disk and an active corona atop the standard disk ( see beloborodov 1999a for a recent review ) .",
    "the advective hot - disk models ( e.g. esin et al .",
    "1998 ) are consistent with the observed spectrum and luminosity of cyg x-1 if the accretion rate has a specific value @xmath31 @xmath32 and the viscosity parameter @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "small variations in the accretion rate , @xmath38 , were predicted to destroy the hard state ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ; but see also zdziarski 1998 ) .",
    "by contrast , the luminosity of cyg x-1 is known to vary by a factor of two without substantial changes in the spectral shape ( e.g. , paciesas et al .",
    "1997 ; gierliski et al .",
    "such fluctuations already challenged the model , and the hard outbursts analyzed in this letter are even more difficult to explain .",
    "the model would work only assuming a specific dependence @xmath39 that keeps @xmath40 ; @xmath41 then should be about unity at the peak of the outburst .    in the context of the disk - corona model",
    ", the outbursts can be interperted as an enhanced coronal activity of the accretion disk . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray spectral slope is controlled by one parameter , the feedback factor due to x - ray reprocessing by the disk .",
    "the hard - state spectrum of cyg  x-1 is well explained if the coronal plasma is ejected away from the disk with a mildly relativistic velocity @xmath42 ( beloborodov 1999b ; malzac , beloborodov , & poutanen 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , the observed emission may be produced by a static corona atop a strongly ionized disk ( e.g. , ross , fabian , & young 1999 ; nayakshin 1999 ) .",
    "the corona becomes @xmath43dominated at high luminosities and its temperature decreases ( e.g. , svensson 1984 ; stern et al .",
    "1995 ; poutanen & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "pair creation may cause the shift of the spectral break in outburst 11289e to smaller energies .",
    "cyg  x-1 is a massive x - ray binary and it may be fed mainly by the donor wind . then the pattern of accretion can change completely compared to the standard viscous @xmath44disk or its modifications .",
    "the captured wind matter has a low angular momentum , just about critical for disk formation ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "under such conditions , a small - scale inviscid disk forms , which accretes super - sonically ( beloborodov & illarionov 2001 ) . the disk forms in the ring - like caustic of the accretion flow where energy is liberated in inelastic collision of gas streams . a comptonized power - law spectrum",
    "is then emitted with a standard break at @xmath29  kev , and it has appearance of a normal hard state of cyg  x-1 .",
    "the two - component emission in outburst 11289e probably requires a two - zone emission model .",
    "for instance , the soft component may be associated with a variable coronal emission atop the disk , and the hard component with an inner relativistic jet .",
    "a corona - jet model was recently proposed by brocksopp et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on correlations between the x - rays and the radio emission observed in cyg x-1 .",
    "the april 1999 outbursts were , however , too short to have a significant impact on the flux in radio and no substantial changes were detected ( r.  fender and g.  pooley , private communication ) . in the context of the wind - fed accretion model , the two - component emission can naturally appear if viscous accretion disk and wind - disk collision are both operating in the source .",
    "concluding , the 1999 april 21 outbursts are the brightest events detected from cyg x-1 by batse during 9 years of its operation .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosity above 30  kev was in excess of @xmath45 .",
    "unfortunately , there are no simultaneous observations in the soft x - rays , so that one can only guess what was the total luminosity .",
    "the large luminosity and unusual spectral behavior challenge the theoretical models of accretion in cyg x-1 .",
    "we thank rob fender , guy pooley , and jerry bonnell for useful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to rob preece and geoff pendleton for providing the code for computing the detector response matrix and an anonymous referee for useful comments that significantly improved the paper .",
