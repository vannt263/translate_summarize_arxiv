    "nonclassical light generation has attracted much attention over the last 40 years , partly because it not only provides a powerful probe for addressing fundamental issues of quantum theory such as complementarity , hidden variables , and other aspects central to the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite ; but also holds promise for many potential applications to quantum information processing @xcite , quantum computation and communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum imaging @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite . in particular , entangled photon pairs",
    "have already been established as a standard research tool in the field of quantum optics .",
    "traditionally , paired photons are produced from spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite , in which a strong pump laser drives the atomic oscillators in a noncentrosymmetric crystal into a nonlinear regime , and then two down - converted beams are radiated by these oscillators .",
    "the two down - converted photons from such a nonlinear process usually have very broad bandwidth ( typically in the thz range ) and very short coherence time ( typically around few picoseconds ) so that their waveforms are not resolvable by existing single - photon detectors ( which have resolution around the nanosecond range ) .",
    "in addition , the short coherence length of the spdc biphotons , roughly about @xmath0 @xmath1 m , also limits their application in long - distance quantum communication .",
    "the optical properties of these wide - band biphotons have been well studied both experimentally and theoretically for more than two decades @xcite .",
    "narrow - bandwidth biphotons are ideal for a number of recently proposed protocols for long - distance quantum communication based on coherent interaction between single photons and atomic ensembles @xcite , which require efficiently absorbing biphotons and storing the entanglement .",
    "other applications include the long - distance quantum state teleportation which requires long temporal coherence time of paired photons @xcite . using cavity - enhanced spdc in nonlinear crystals , paired photons with a bandwidth of about 10 mhz and coherence time of about @xmath2 ns",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "however , the spdc process is usually tuned to occur in the region of far - off - resonant atomic transitions , which limits the conversion efficiency and requires a large pump power . moreover , in the far - off - resonant pumping the nonlinear parametric coupling coefficient can be treated as a constant and the information about the material internal transition structure is unresolvable from the two - photon correlation measurement .",
    "the two most recently developed advanced technologies make the near- and on - resonance nonlinear processes possible .",
    "the first is laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms @xcite . because cold atoms with a temperature of about 100 @xmath3 have negligible doppler broadening and very long lifetime , their atomic hyperfine structures",
    "can be resolved without need of a doppler - free setup .",
    "the second is the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite which not only can eliminate absorption on resonance but also enhance nonlinear interactions at low light level @xcite . following the theoretical proposal in @xcite and early experiments by lukin and kimble groups @xcite , generation of nonclassical correlated photon pairs by exploring the  writing - reading \"",
    "procedure has attracted much research interest .",
    "however , the created paired photons are not maximally time - frequency entangled due to two separate operation processes .",
    "using cold atomic - gas media and eit - assisted four - wave mixing ( fwm ) , harris group at stanford university was the first to generate time - frequency entangled narrow - band biphotons with cw driving fields in a double-@xmath4 system @xcite . by controlling the eit at a sufficiently high optical depth ( od ) around 50",
    ", biphotons with subnatural linewidth have been produced in a recent experiment , where the coherence time is up to about 1 @xmath1s in a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "vuletic and his colleagues have also produced biphotons with a temporal coherence length of 100 ns by trapping cold atoms inside an optical cavity @xcite .",
    ", by driving a two - level system into the nonlinear region , have also created paired photons with correlation time of same order of magnitude @xcite .    to describe the physics behind narrow - band biphoton generation from the eit - based multilevel atomic system ,",
    "two different approaches have been presented in the literature .",
    "one approach is to use the heisenberg - langevin method by solving the coupled field operator equations in the heisenberg picture , and the results agree well with the experimental data in the two - photon correlation measurement @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it provides a sophisticated calculation of the effects from the langevin noises , the medium absorption and optical gain on the biphoton wavepacket .",
    "working in the interaction picture , the other approach developed by wen _",
    "@xcite focuses on the description of the two - photon state vector after the nonlinear medium using perturbation theory .",
    "this state vector theory not only properly describes the experimental results but also offers a clear physical picture on biphoton generation mechanism .",
    "it is the intent of this paper to review and generalize this latter approach by taking into account both linear loss and gain , and provide more insights on the roles of nonlinear interaction and linear response to the biphoton amplitude . using this state vector picture",
    ", we show that the two - photon wave function is a convolution of the nonlinear and linear optical responses .",
    "according to this convolution , the two - photon temporal correlation is considered in two regimes , damped rabi oscillation and group delay .",
