    "clean systems of interacting moments have been studied extensively by analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "although simplified models like ising , heisenberg , and hubbard retain only the most fundamental interactions observed in real materials , they remain tractable to current theoretical techniques , and the study of their ordered phases in various regions of parameter space has contributed enormously to our understanding of magnetic phenomena and the physics of correlated systems .",
    "@xcite however , real materials are never clean .",
    "there is often frustration due to competing interactions and disorder in the interaction strengths .",
    "competing interactions that cause magnetic frustration can have many origins , lattice geometry , magnetic and non - magnetic impurities . in three dimensions ,",
    "helical magnetic order has been observed when geometric frustration is accompanied by anisotropy .",
    "@xcite spin glasses phases are observed when frustration is accompanied by random disorder .",
    "@xcite it has also been suggested that some non - collinear spin ordered structures belong to a new chiral universality class .  @xcite the systems we study are essentially two dimensional and contain no anisotropic terms or disorder .",
    "frustration is caused by the lattice geometry .",
    "our primary focus is the orthogonal magnetic structure observed in the mixed layer pnictide oxides .",
    "@xcite    the pnictide oxides of type @xmath1 are layered antiferromagnets that contain two distinct square planes of manganese atoms arranged in a lattice of space group symmetry @xmath2 in one layer , manganese is bonded to oxygen in a planar @xmath3 arrangement , @xmath4 in a second layer , it is bonded to a pnictogen in a tetrahedral structure , @xmath5 where pnictogen atoms project alternately above and below the plane defined by the manganese atoms . from here on we denote the two layers as mn(1 ) for @xmath6 and mn(2 ) for @xmath7 the mn atoms from the two planes are arranged so that a site in the mn(1 ) layer sits directly above and below the center of a square plaquette of mn atoms in the mn(2 ) layer .",
    "the manganese carry a spin @xmath8 frustration can enter through nearest neighbor interlayer coupling .",
    "a more detailed investigation of these systems has been reported elsewhere .",
    "in all the pnictide oxides except @xmath9 there is long range order in the planes that eventually gives rise to weak @xmath10 order . in the compound @xmath11",
    "there is only short range order in the mn(1 ) planes . the ability of ordered planes to drive c - axis order has been investigate before in the case of layered antiferromagnets .",
    "@xcite in @xmath12 , magnetic order in the mn(1 ) layers is established along the a - axis of the magnetic unit cell , while in the mn(2 ) layers the magnetization is along the c - axis .",
    "hence there is an orthogonal alignment between neighboring layers .",
    "such an ordered state is not without precedent .",
    "@xcite however , the different temperatures at which the layers order ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the symmetry of the frustrated interlayer interactions which leads to cancellation suggest a system of two independent nel ordered layers .",
    "previous work has shown that this is not always the case , as thermal or quantum fluctuations ( in frustrated systems ) can lift the degeneracy of the system to select a single state .",
    "@xcite    to study the effect of frustration on the ground state magnetic order of the pnictide oxides , we developed a simple model of classical heisenberg spins with nearest neighbor intra- and interlayer interactions .",
    "the basic structural unit is a set of two layers , one each of type mn(1 ) and @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - exptgeo ] ) . the mn(2 ) layer has a lattice constant @xmath16 and contains @xmath17 sites .",
    "the mn(1 ) layer is larger by a factor @xmath18 and is rotated by @xmath19 with respect to the lattice directions of the other layer .",
    "the mn(1 ) layer contains @xmath20 spins .",
    "note that the interlayer coordination is not the same for spins on the two layers .",
    "a spin on the mn(1 ) plane is coupled to four spins on the mn(2 ) plane , and each spin in the mn(2 ) plane is coupled to only two spins on the mn(1 ) plane .",
    "the hamiltonian for our bilayer model is written as @xmath21 the constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the mn(1 ) and mn(2 ) intralayer couplings and the interlayer coupling , respectively .",
    "the summations of @xmath24 are over nearest neighbors to site @xmath25 for classical spins , one has @xmath26 .",
    "the relatively large spin-@xmath27 of the mn atoms in the pnictide oxides makes this a reasonable approximation .",
    "we studied the equilibrium physics of our model by a single spin flip monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we have addressed concerns about proper sampling of phase space by performing simulations with random and ordered initial configurations .",
    "we have also considered the effects of the boundary on our finite simulations by employing a few different boundary conditions : open , periodic , and periodic with an effective field on the mn(1 ) edge sites . in all cases considered , we found no qualitative difference in our results due to the initial configuration or the conditions imposed at the boundary .    to determine the relative orientation between neighboring spins , either within the same layer or in different layers , we measured a collinear @xmath28 and a perpendicular @xmath29 spin - spin correlation function . here",
    "summations are performed over all nearest neighbors @xmath30 of site i and then over all sites in the lattice ; @xmath31 is the coordination number and @xmath32 is the number of sites in layer @xmath33 intralayer correlations are denoted by @xmath34 and interlayer correlations are represented by @xmath35 we stress that @xmath36 and @xmath37 measure local correlations . for classical heisenberg spins ,",
    "these correlations take on the simple forms @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the high temperature , paramagnetic , limit , the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained .",
    "we also measured the magnetization and staggered magnetization of each layer .",
    "from the experimental data , representative couplings would set the mn(2 ) intralayer exchange to be stronger than the mn(1 ) intralayer exchange , with the interlayer interaction weaker by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , experimentally motivated couplings in our model were set to @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the results presented herein , systems with @xmath44 spins per mn(1 ) layer and @xmath45 spins per mn(1 ) were equilibrated for @xmath46 to @xmath47 sweeps followed by @xmath46 measurement sweeps with @xmath48 sweeps between measurements .",
    "one monte carlo sweep denotes an update of all spins on the lattice .",
    "our results for a bilayer model indicate that , as a function of temperature , the moments within each layer began to order when the temperature dropped below the respective energy scale , e.g. , @xmath49 for mn(1 ) moments and @xmath50 for mn(2 ) moments .",
    "however , the eventual ground state was a system of two nel ordered layers with an arbitrary orientation between the magnetization directions . in a simulation with four layers ( i.e. , a layered sequence @xmath51 ) and periodic boundary conditions along the c - axis",
    ", we observed the same qualitative behavior as a function of temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - exptcpp ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the interlayer spin - spin correlation function , @xmath52 remained at the paramagnetic limit down to low temperatures , @xmath53    we also studied the effect of the strength of frustration on the magnetic ground state . to do this , we fixed the temperature and swept in values of @xmath54 for a bilayer model with @xmath55 we observed two nel ordered layers with a paramagnetic interlayer orientation , i.e. , @xmath56 or independent layers .",
    "as @xmath23 was increased , the two nel ordered layers moved towards a collinear state .",
    "we observed this behavior independent of the initial configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - j11j22 ] ) .",
    "an explanation of these results can be understood by considering the physics of two simpler models , a zigzag lattice and a diagonal lattice , ( refer to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the zigzag lattice",
    "the frustration is along one crystalline direction ; this geometry is similar to the mn(2 ) to mn(1 ) interlayer interaction . in the limit of weak @xmath57 a uniformly canted state",
    "is established in the zigzag lattice with orthogonal order obtained in the limit @xmath58 in the diagonal lattice , one has the equivalent of the @xmath59 model .",
    "this interlayer geometry is analogous to the coupling of mn(1 ) sites to mn(2 ) sites . in the limit of weak",
    "@xmath57 the diagonal lattice is composed of two nel ordered layers with a collinear alignment .",
    "hence , at weak frustration , it is the competition between these two tendencies in the experimental model that leads to a paramagnetic orientation with large fluctuations . in the case of strong frustration , @xmath60 the zigzag and diagonal geometries both select a collinear interlayer arrangement .",
    "an orthogonal state for our bilayer model can be found but this phase occurs at couplings strengths that are not supported by experiments ( refer to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case where @xmath61 the resultant model is a network of intersecting zigzag chains . by setting @xmath62 and sweeping in @xmath63 a transition to a uniformly canted state",
    "was observed in the limit of large @xmath63 . for a model with @xmath64",
    "we observed a nel ordered mn(2 ) layer and a paramagnetic mn(1 ) layer , but with mn(1 ) spins orthogonal to the local mn(2 ) environment , for @xmath65 . at @xmath66",
    "the system tended toward a state with collinear alignment .",
    "we conclude that frustration caused by nearest neighbor interactions , both intra- and interlayer , in the mixed layer pnictide oxides is not sufficient to explain the long range orthogonal order that is observed experimentally .",
    "however , recent work on mixed metal pnictide oxides does indicate that the two distinct layers do not behave independently .",
    "@xcite in these systems , it is likely that other terms in the hamiltonian , e.g. , ion anisotropies arising from spin - orbit effects , are required to explain the magnetic behavior .",
