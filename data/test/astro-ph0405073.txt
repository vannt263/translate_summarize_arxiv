    "as is well known , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism has been regarded as a reasonable process for powering the radio jets in agns ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "recently the bz mechanism has been used as a central engine for powering gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , where rotating energy of a stellar black hole ( bh ) with magnetic field of @xmath0 is extracted along the magnetic field lines supported by a magnetized accretion disk ( lee et al .",
    "2000 ; wang et al . 2002a ) .",
    "according to the bz theory the power extracted from the bh arises from the rotation of the open magnetic field lines relative to the bh horizon , resulting in the electromotive force ( emf ) in an equivalent circuit ( macdonald and thorne 1982 , hereafter mt82 ) .",
    "the bz power can be effectively regarded as the power of the current dissipated on the astrophysical load .",
    "recently much attention has been paid on the magnetic coupling ( mc ) process , where energy and angular momentum are transferred from a fast - rotating bh to its surrounding disk by virtue of the closed field lines connecting them ( blandford 1999 ; li 2002a , hereafter l02 ; wang et al .",
    "2002b , 2003a , hereafter w02",
    ", w03a , respectively ) .",
    "in w02 we worked out an equivalent circuit to calculate the bz and mc powers .",
    "very recently we discussed the condition for the coexistence of the bz and mc processes ( cebzmc ) , and found that the state of cebzmc always accompanies the screw instability of the magnetic field connecting a rotating bh with its surrounding disk ( wang et al .",
    "2003b , 2004 , hereafter w03b and w04 , respectively ) .",
    "it turns out that the screw instability will occur at some place far away from the inner edge of the disk , if the bh spin and the power - law index for the variation of the magnetic field are greater than some critical values .    in this paper a new scenario for extracting rotational energy of the disk matter is proposed by considering the configuration of the magnetic field restricted by the screw instability . to facilitate description ,",
    "this mechanism is referred to as the dl process , implying that energy and angular momentum are extracted magnetically from * disk * to * load*. by using another equivalent circuit we derived the expression for the dl power and torque under some assumptions on the unknown astrophysical load .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the restriction of the screw instability to the configuration of the magnetic field is discussed , in which the three energy mechanisms are contained . in ",
    "3 the expressions for the powers and torques of the three mechanisms are derived in the two kinds of equivalent circuits .",
    "we compare these powers with the variation of the two parameters , i.e. , the bh spin and the power - law index of the magnetic field on the disk .",
    "it turns out that the dl power is generally less than the bz and mc powers , and it is comparable with the latter two when the bh spin approaches unity . in ",
    "4 the radiation from a quasi - steady thin disk is discussed in detail by applying the conservation laws of mass , energy and angular momentum to the regions corresponding to the mc and dl processes . in ",
    "5 the poloidal current densities flowing from the bh magnetosphere into the horizon and disk are calculated in the regions corresponding to the three energy mechanisms .",
    "finally , in  6 , we summarize our main results and argue that this model can be used to extract clean energy from a rotating bh for powering grbs .    throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath1 are used , and the assumptions for bh accretion disk and the magnetic field are adopted as given in w03b and w04 .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic field configurations with both poloidal and toroidal components can be screw instable ( kadomtsev 1966 ; bateman 1978 ) . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion ( kadomtsev 1966 ) ,",
    "the screw instability will occur , if the toroidal magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic field line turns around itself about once .",
    "recently some authors discussed the screw instability with different conditions in the bh magnetosphere ( gruzinov 1999 ; li 2000a ; tomimatsu et el . 2001 ) .",
    "in w04 we discussed the screw instability of the magnetic field in the mc process , and argued that the instability will occur if the following criterion is satisfied ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the poloidal length of the closed field line connecting the bh with the disk , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field on the disk , respectively , and @xmath6 is the cylindrical radius on the disk and reads    @xmath7    in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the bh mass and spin , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is the radial coordinate on the disk , which is defined in terms of the radius of the marginally stable orbit , and @xmath11 is related to @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the following relation ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) ,    @xmath12^{1 / 2 } } \\right\\}^{1 / 2},\\mbox { } \\\\   a_1 = 1 + \\left ( { 1 - a _ * ^2 } \\right)^{1 / 3}\\left [ { \\left ( { 1 + a _ * } \\right)^{1 / 3 } + \\left ( { 1 - a _ * } \\right)^{1 / 3 } } \\right ] , \\\\   a_2 = \\left ( { 3a _ * ^2 + a_1 ^ 2 } \\right)^{1 / 2 } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    it is found , from the criterion ( [ eq1 ] ) , that the screw instability will occur , provided that the bh spin @xmath9 and the power - law index @xmath13 are great enough .",
    "for the given values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 we can determine the disk region for the screw instability by using the criterion ( [ eq1 ] ) as follows ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the minimum radial coordinate for the screw instability .",
    "we think that the screw instability prevents the closed field lines to reach the region indicated by inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that the configuration of the magnetic field in this region might consist of the open field lines connecting the disk with the astrophysical load , and this region is referred to as the dl region corresponding to the dl process . considering the restriction of the screw instability , we modify the configuration of the magnetic field as shown in figure 1 , and the three mechanisms of extracting energy magnetically from the bh accretion disk are included : ( [ eq1 ] ) the bz process involved the open field lines connecting the bh with the astrophysical load , ( [ eq2 ] ) the mc process involved the closed field lines connecting the bh with the surrounding disk , and ( [ eq3 ] ) the dl process involved the open field lines connecting the disk with the astrophysical load .",
    "now we give a brief description for the configuration in figure 1 .",
    "in w03b we discussed the angular boundary between the open and closed field lines on the bh horizon .",
    "it is shown that the boundary angle @xmath17 exists in cebzmc , if the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath13 are great enough .",
    "in w04 we argued that the state of cebzmc always accompanies the screw instability , and the minimum radial coordinate @xmath18 for the screw instability can be determined by the criterion ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "considering the restriction of the screw instability to the closed field lines and the action of the magnetic pressure on the horizon , we think that the boundary angle will be extended from @xmath17 to @xmath19 .",
    "the angles @xmath17 and @xmath20 are related respectively to infinitive and the minimum radial coordinate @xmath21 by the mapping relation ( w04 ) :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    therefore the angular region of the open field lines for the bz process is given by    @xmath24    and the angular region of the closed field lines for the mc process is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the lower boundary angle of the closed field lines . throughout this paper @xmath27",
    "is assumed in calculations .",
    "accordingly the value range of the radial coordinate for the mc process is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to @xmath26 and @xmath20 by the mapping relation ( [ eq5 ] ) , respectively .",
    "following blandford ( 1976 ) , we assume that the poloidal magnetic field varies with the parameter @xmath31 on the disk as a power law ( w03a , w03b ) ,    @xmath32\\xi ^ { - n } , \\quad 1 < \\xi < \\xi _ s , \\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the poloidal component of the magnetic field on the horizon , and @xmath13 is the power - law index of @xmath4 varying with @xmath31 . the quantities",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the radius of the horizon and that of the inner edge of the disk , respectively .    according to the above discussion",
    "the value range of the radial coordinate for the dl process is given by equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , and the corresponding poloidal magnetic field varies with the parameter @xmath31 as follows ,    @xmath36    equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is similar to equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are replaced by @xmath39 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "it is tempting for us to discuss the power extracted from bh accretion disk based on the above magnetic field configuration . in w02 we derived the expressions for the bz and mc powers by using an equivalent circuit as shown in figure 2 ( henceforth circuit i ) , where segments @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the two adjacent magnetic surfaces , and segments @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the bh horizon and the loads ( either the astrophysical load or the disk load ) sandwiched by the two magnetic surfaces , respectively .        by using circuit i",
    "we derive the expressions for the bz and mc powers and those for the bz and mc torques corresponding to the modified configuration of the magnetic field as follows ,    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related by    @xmath52    in equations ( [ eq12])([eq15 ] ) the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the ratios of the angular velocities of the open and closed field lines to the angular velocity of the horizon and read    @xmath55^ { - 1}.\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the angular velocity of the magnetic field line , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the angular velocities of the horizon and the disk and read    @xmath59    usually @xmath60 is taken for the optimal bz power ( mt82 ) , while @xmath54 depends on the bh spin and the place where the field line penetrates on the disk . in equations ( [ eq12])([eq15 ] ) we use the parameter @xmath61 , and the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are defined as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the strength of the poloidal magnetic field on the horizon in units of @xmath66 .",
    "considering that the poloidal magnetic field will exert a braking torque on the current in the dl region , we can calculate the dl power and torque by using the equivalent circuit as shown in figure 3 .",
    "henceforth this equivalent circuit is referred to as circuit ii , where segments @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the two adjacent magnetic surfaces consisting of the open field lines in the dl region , and segments @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the disk surface in the dl region and the load sandwiched by the two adjacent magnetic surfaces , respectively .",
    "the quantities * * @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( the subscript `` @xmath73 '' is omitted ) are the resistance of the load and emf due to the rotation of the disk , respectively . the disk load is neglected in calculations by considering the perfect conductivity of plasma .",
