    "nowadays , the past three decades have witnessed significant progress on fractional calculus , because the applications of fractional calculus are found in more and more scientific fields , covering mechanics , physics , engineering , informatics , and materials .",
    "the list of such applications is long , for instance , it includes viscoelasticity , colored noise , dielectric polarization , electrode - electrolyte polarization , electromagnetic waves , control engineering and so on@xcite .",
    "in fact , real word processes generally or most likely are fractional - order systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore , fractional order controllers have so far been implemented to enhance the robustness and the performance of the closed loop control systems , the stability problem of fractional - order systems has been investigated both from an algebraic and an analytic point of view@xcite .    on the other hand , as one of the most basic problem of coordination control for networked systems , consensus of multi - agent systems has been widespread concerned as an important research topic in the field of systems control .",
    "consensus of multi - agent systems means that several distributed agents achieve the same state or output through local mutual coupling effect among the individuals , where the centralized control is not used .",
    "based on the computer model proposed by reynolds which imitates animals flocking @xcite , vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite firstly proposed a non - equilibrium multi - agent system model from the point of view of statistical mechanics , simulation shows that all individuals in the system can run in accordance with the same direction under certain conditions .",
    "recently , since the wide application of multi - agent systems in various fields , many scholars have devoted themselves to study the consensus of multi - agent systems @xcite .",
    "when the information transferring , communication delays will occur in networked control system and affect the features of the system .",
    "the effects of communication delays on movement consensus of multi - agent systems have been concerned by many scholars @xcite , and the stability of delay system also become a hot topic in the multiple agents field .",
    "the important results of the above literatures pay attention to the consensus problem of integer - order multi - agent systems . in the complex environment , many dynamic characteristics of natural phenomena can not be described in the form integer - order equation , but only be described in the dynamics of fractional - order ( non - integer order ) behavior , for example : flocking movement and food searching by means of the individual secretions and microbial , submarine underwater robots in the bottom of the sea with a large number of microorganisms and viscous substances , unmanned aerial vehicles running in the complex space environment @xcite .",
    "cao and ren @xcite studied distribution coordination of fractional - order multi - agent systems firstly , and gave the relationship between the number of individuals and the fractional order in the stable multi - agent systems .",
    "however , to the best of authors knowledge , there are few researches done on the coordination control of fractional - order multi - agent systems with communication delays .    in this paper , we suppose agents work in the complex environment , the heterogeneous dynamics with fractional - order and integer - order is presented for multi - agent systems .",
    "the main innovation of this paper lies in the study on consensus of compound - order ( fractional - order and integer - order ) distributed multi - agent systems with different time delays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some necessary definitions and notations are given on fractional calculus . in section 3 ,",
    "the compound - order dynamics of the fractional order system and the integer order system is presented .",
    "the consensus of integer - fractional compounded - order multi - agent systems with communication delays is studied in section 4 .",
    "the corresponding simulation results are provided in section 5 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "fractional calculus plays an important role in modern science .",
    "there are mainly two widely used fractional operators : caputo and riemann - liouville ( r - l ) fractional operators@xcite . in physical systems ,",
    "caputo fractional operator is more practical than r - l fractional operator because r - l fractional operator has initial value problems .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will use caputo fractional operator to model the system dynamics and analyze the stability of the proposed coordination algorithms .",
    "generally , caputo fractional operator includes caputo integral and caputo derivative .",
