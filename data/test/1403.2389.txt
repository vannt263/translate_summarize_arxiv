    "the so - called @xmath0-cdm cosmology @xcite , in which the universe is dominated by dark energy and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , accurately describes the large scale properties and evolution of the cosmos . on the scale of the halos of large galaxies ,",
    "this model predicts copious cdm sub - structures , the most massive of which are identified with the dwarf satellite galaxies that are observed to inhabit such regions @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations that adopt this framework @xcite generally reveal that the sub - halos that could host visible dwarf galaxies are distributed roughly spherically about the large galaxy .",
    "observationally however , the distribution of dwarf galaxies within the local group appears to be more complicated . @xcite and @xcite first noted that several prominent dwarf galaxies are correlated with streams of emission , and suggested that the outer halo globular clusters of the milky way may represent ` ghostly ' indicators of ancient accretions @xcite .",
    "more recent analyses @xcite that include the faint dwarf galaxies detected during the past decade in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) support the earlier results , although concerns remain about the spatial selection biasses given the sdss sky coverage .",
    "interestingly , the satellites appear to be rotationally stabilized , orbiting within the plane defined by their spatial alignment @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that the proposed planes of satellites are not predicted within @xmath0-cdm , and can not simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion , although other studies dispute this conclusion @xcite .    in a previous contribution",
    "we showed that our nearest large companion , the andromeda galaxy , possesses an immense , kinematically coherent , thin plane of dwarf galaxies , representing @xmath2 of the total dwarf population of andromeda ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , confirming previous studies @xcite that had hinted at potential spatial correlations of dwarfs in m31 .",
    "a scenario that has been proposed to explain these alignments is that the present - day satellites are the remnants of tidal dwarf galaxies formed in ancient major mergers @xcite .",
    "this explanation is problematic , however , as it requires that the dwarfs are not dark matter dominated .",
    "it is in this context that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bb14 ) recently analyzed the millennium - ii simulation @xcite , to investigate the incidence of satellite alignments in that large @xmath3 volume of a @xmath0-cdm universe .",
    "they concluded that due to the spatial correlation between satellites in @xmath0-cdm , structures similar to that observed are relatively common , arising in approximately 2% of the halos they investigated .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to examine the validity of the bb14 analysis , and to extend our earlier analysis to make better use of the accurate kinematic information available for the real satellites . in section  [ sec : sample_selection ] , we discuss how the samples were selected from the simulation .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the analysis and results , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we select sub - halos from the millennium - ii simulation , using the @xcite catalog which was scaled to the wmap year 7 analysis .",
    "the semi - analytic recipes that were applied to the dark matter simulation provide a wealth of predicted physical properties for galaxies that reside within the dark matter halos .",
    "since we are interested in selecting systems similar to m31 , we follow bb14 and pick all halos in the redshift @xmath4 snapshot that have virial masses between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , mass - weighted age @xmath7 , and whose neighbors within @xmath8 have a baryonic component less massive than @xmath9 .",
    "( we define the baryonic mass to be the sum of the stellar and cold gas components ) . a total of 1141 such hosts are found .",
    "in addition to those bb14 selection criteria , we apply the following three criteria to select hosts that are reasonably similar to m31 .",
    "we require that the hosts have baryonic masses in the range @xmath10@xmath11 ( this leaves 1024 galaxies ) , and we require that the group that the host galaxy resides in should have mass @xmath12 , a 95% upper limit to the mass of the local group @xcite ( leaving 885 galaxies ) . to ensure that the m31 analog , as in reality , is the dominant galaxy within the survey region , we finally reject hosts that have a companion within @xmath8 that possesses @xmath13 of their baryonic mass .",
    "these cuts yield a sample of 679 host galaxies within the millennium - ii simulation .    figure  [ fig : observations]a shows the observed distribution of the 15 satellites of m31 that are confined to a narrow plane .",
    "it can be immediately appreciated that the plane lies almost perfectly edge - on from our viewing point .",
    "the side view is displayed in figure  [ fig : observations]b , using the most likely value of the line of sight distances measured by @xcite .",
    "the arrows mark the measured line of sight velocity @xcite , with the red arrows showing those satellites that have the same sense of rotation .    to reproduce the observational configuration , we place ourselves in the simulation at a random position @xmath14 distant from the host galaxy ( equivalent to the milky way - m31 distance , @xcite ) , with a random camera angle .",
    "we initially select all the sub - halos within the millennium - ii simulation that lie within @xmath8 of the chosen host and that have stellar mass @xmath15 ( as proposed by bb14 ) , to which we then apply the pandas spatial selection function .    within the pandas area shown in figure  [ fig : observations]a ,",
    "27 satellites are known ( beyond @xmath16 ) , of which 15 are narrowly aligned in the thin plane discussed by @xcite . to approximate this observed sample , we select in the simulation the brightest 27 satellites that are visible within the pandas field of view .",
    "if there are less than 27 satellites within this field of view , we discard the viewing position and draw a new one .    using exactly the same procedure as was applied to the real data in @xcite",
    ", we calculate the pole of the plane that has the lowest perpendicular rms dispersion ( i.e. the thinnest plane ) for any sub - sample of 15 satellites . in a coordinate system",
    "where @xmath17 points east , @xmath18 points north and @xmath19 points along the line of sight vector to m31 ( i.e. as shown in figures  [ fig : observations]b and [ fig : observations]d ) , the pole of the observed structure points towards @xmath20 . if the pole of the lowest rms plane , as seen from the randomly - chosen viewpoint , lies within @xmath21 of the pole of the real plane , we store this host and its sample of satellites ; otherwise a new viewing position is randomly drawn .",
    "if no sample is found after @xmath22 random draws of the viewing position , we discard the host .",
    "this procedure is repeated 12 times , so as to obtain ( in the best cases ) 12 different views of each of the 679 host galaxies",
    ". cases where a new viewing position of the same host coincided within @xmath23 to one previously calculated were discarded , as we considered such configurations to be `` repeats '' of the previous solutions ) of satellites , meaning that different sub - samples are selected from different viewing positions .",
    "while our procedure gives rise to identical satellite sub - samples in 1.2% of the random draws , the @xmath24 separation requirement still means that these provide different line of sight velocity projections ( used in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] ) . in 76% of the draws",
    "more than @xmath25 of the satellites are different .",
    "hence the multiple views help build up better statistics . ] .    in figures  [ fig : observations]c and [ fig : observations]d we overplot all the sub - samples of 15 satellites found around the host galaxies in the way described above .",
    "the samples have been rotated so that the viewpoint lies at @xmath26 . by construction ,",
    "the random samples have the same orientation as the data .",
    "our main motivation to force the alignments to be edge - on was to be able to compare the radial velocity information on the satellites directly to the simulations , but this also automatically corrects for the inclination - dependent detection bias in pandas @xcite , and it also avoids the issue that rotation of a structure aligned perpendicular to the line of sight would not have been detected .",
    "nevertheless , tests show that forcing this orientation does not substantially alter the results below .",
    "the semi - analytic modeling of @xcite differentiates normal galaxies from `` orphans '' ; the latter being systems whose parent subhalo is no longer resolved .",
    "it is possible that many of these orphans are tidally disrupted , and that they are hence not directly comparable to the observed dwarf galaxies . despite these concerns",
    ", we will first assume that the orphan satellites represent structures that can be reliably compared to real dwarf galaxies ( this is an assumption that bb14 considered ) .",
    "however , we noticed that in the millennium - ii simulation , many of the orphans are spatially clustered around massive sub - halos .",
    "we decided to reject all the orphan satellites that were next to a massive , non - orphan , satellite , closer than twice the radius of the stellar disk of the non - orphan satellite .",
    "this is justified on the grounds that in reality it is unlikely that such objects would have been identified ( they would be very hard to distinguish from their companion ) .",
    "additionally , we reject orphan satellites that are both closer than @xmath27 ( which corresponds approximately to the line of sight distance uncertainty for the best measured dwarf galaxies ) and that have space velocities @xmath28 from a non - orphan satellite , since observationally we would consider such objects to be tidal debris .",
    "this is the sample that was displayed previously in figures  [ fig : observations]c and [ fig : observations]d .",
    "one notices immediately from a visual comparison of panels ( b ) and ( d ) that the sample of simulated satellites that includes orphans is significantly more centrally - concentrated than the real satellites , so clearly the extent of the plane is an important property to attempt to reproduce , in addition to its thinness .",
    "bb14 decided to parametrize the radial extent via the rms dispersion within the plane ( `` rms parallel '' ) , which we calculate as the sum of the squares of the distances in the plane _ from the host galaxy_. in figure  [ fig : parameters]a we show this parameter plotted against the plane thickness ( `` rms perpendicular '' ) .",
    "let us define `` condition 1 '' to be the requirement that the simulated systems should be thinner than the observed structure ( @xmath29 ) , `` condition 2 '' that they should be spatially more extended than the observations ( @xmath30 ) , and `` condition 3 '' that 13 or more out of the subsamples of 15 satellites share the same sense of rotation .",
    "we find that 2% of the systems @xmath31 conform to conditions 1 and 2 ( crosses in panel ( a ) ) , but only 3 out of 7757 simulated systems ( 0.04% ) conform to conditions 1,2 and 3 ( crosses in panel ( c ) ) .",
    "if instead we discard all the orphan satellites , we obtain the parameter distributions displayed in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : parameters ] . in this case",
    "not a single system within the millennium - ii simulation out of a sample of 4974 is more extreme than the m31 satellite structure ( upper limit of @xmath32% ) .",
    "note that we have been very conservative in the selection , and have not counted any system in which we could not find 27 satellites of which 15 are in an edge - on configuration ( which is why the number of systems in the right panels of figure  [ fig : parameters ] is lower than in the left panels ) .",
    "an interesting and useful additional view of the parameter space of the properties of the satellite structure is given in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] .",
    "since we deliberately enforced the simulated alignments to be seen with the same orientation as the observations , we can directly compare the line of sight velocities of the satellites with the real measurements .",
    "in reality we do not have access to the proper motions of the satellites , neither do we have reliable total mass estimates , so we can not measure their total angular momentum .",
    "however , it is possible to calculate the minimum specific angular momentum , @xmath33 , simply by using the line of sight velocities and taking the unknown transverse motions to be zero .",
    "exactly the same statistic can be calculated for the simulated satellite galaxies , so the comparison should be very robust .",
    "in many of the simulated systems , there are a few satellites with extreme values of @xmath33 . to avoid being dominated by such outliers",
    ", we chose to adopt ( the absolute value of ) the median of @xmath33 as our statistic .",
    "this parameter is displayed along with the rms thickness in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] , for which we define a further `` condition 4 '' : that the simulated systems should have median @xmath34 , the value of the @xmath33 in the real data , which implies that bulk motion is not likely to be important for the present discussion . ] .",
    "the bottom panels show the result of applying conditions 1 to 4 to the simulated systems . if we discount orphan satellites , there are no structures in the millennium - ii simulations that compare to what is seen in m31 , but if we allow orphans , 2 out of 7757 systems ( 0.03% ) are more extreme in their thinness , radial extent and kinematic properties than the real structure around andromeda .",
    "it is interesting to inspect these two cases closely .",
    "both systems contain very massive satellites , with virial masses of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , representing mass fractions of 1@xmath375 and 1@xmath373 , and with baryonic masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( baryonic mass fractions of 1@xmath377 and 1@xmath374 ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , each of these halos has an accompanying compact entourage of orphan companions ( unlike the spread - out real system ) , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : observations]d , where we plot the positions and velocities of one of these systems .",
    "finally , in both cases , the massive companion is approaching the host for the first time .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the observed structure in m31 is due to the accretion of such a system , and indeed the baryonic masses listed above seem to be in reasonable agreement with that of m33 , which has a stellar mass of @xmath40@xmath41 and a total gas mass of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "it should nevertheless be kept in mind that these accretions of a massive satellite galaxy with a tight sub - system of their own are _ extremely rare _ events in the millennium - ii simulations .",
    "note also that in reality m33 does not partake in the observed planar alignment .",
    "what is the origin of the discrepancy between the conclusions of our work and bb14 ?",
    "the limitation with their study is that when they examine the kinematics of the alignments , they only use one of the structural parameters ( @xmath43 ) , not both ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "once this error is corrected , our results and theirs are surprisingly consistent ( i.e. , our more conservative selection of hosts and the proper pandas spatial selection function applied to the satellites do not substantially affect the result ) : both studies measure a @xmath45% occurrence rate% joint probability only if conditions 2 and 3 are independent . ] .",
    "we have carefully reanalyzed the large - scale `` millennium - ii '' @xmath0-cdm simulation , searching for alignments of satellites similar to that observed around the andromeda galaxy .",
    "we consider m31-like host galaxies in a range of a full decade in stellar mass around the m31 value and require that they reside in parent dark matter halos that are no more massive than plausible values for the local group .    by applying the pandas spatial selection function",
    "we derive views of planes of 15 satellites that are comparable to the observed configuration .",
    "we analyzed the perpendicular thinness , radial extent , coherent kinematics and angular momentum properties of the simulated samples together , and found cases similar to the observed planar structure to be extremely rare , occurring in only 0.030.04% of the samples .",
    "this shows that the observed alignment discovered by @xcite is surprising in @xmath0-cdm , if one assumes that the millennium - ii simulation has sufficient resolution to reliably detect counterparts of the observed satellites .",
    "nevertheless , the extreme rarity of analogs to the m31 system in the millennium - ii simulation does not necessarily preclude the possibility that planar structures may exist around different types of hosts in @xmath0-cdm simulations . by relaxing our search criteria that are specific to m31 , such as the adopted virial and baryonic mass constraints , and the requirement that there be no nearby large neighbor",
    ", the number of candidate systems increases from 679 to over 2000 for virial masses in the range @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "while a thorough analysis of such simulated satellite systems is beyond the scope of the present paper , we believe that it will be of great importance to ascertain the incidence of satellite alignments in nature for galaxies beyond the local group ."
