    "it is perhaps not surprising that quasars were thought to be spectroscopically similar in the early days of quasar research .",
    "accretion phenomena are rather mass invariant so no great diversity was expected and available low s / n spectra certainly looked rather similar .",
    "accretion luminosity can be written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1  indicates distance from the central black hole customarily identified with the radius of the last stable orbit , @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 : so the energetic output is independent of the black hole mass .",
    "recent times have seen more attention given to spectral differences that may be related to the wide range of eddington ratio likely to be present in the quasar population now much better sampled via optical surveys ( bright quasar survey ( bqs ) , hamburg - eso ( he ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , etc . ;",
    "a landmark study of systematic trends in quasar spectra @xcite involved a principal component analysis ( pca ) of 87 bright quasars from the palomar - green survey .",
    "correlations among several parameters measured for emission features in the  spectral region could be grouped into an eigenvector 1 ( e1 ) involving , among other things , an anti - correlation between  and optical   strength .",
    "variations of e1 were later found in a number of larger samples @xcite .",
    "the e1 discovery was eventually generalized into a 4d eigenvector 1 parameters ( 4de1 ) space @xcite which added measures of the soft x - ray photon index ( ) and   broad line profile shift .",
    "the higher dimensionality of the input space is helpful to cover parameters that are independent ( `` orthogonal , '' one is tempted to say ) observationally and that correspond to different physical processes : 1 ) the dynamics of the low - ionization line ( lil ) emitting gas , 2 ) physical conditions and metallicity of the line emitting gas , 3 ) sources of continuum emission and 4 ) the dynamics of the high ionization line ( hil ) emitting region .",
    "it is now clear that all type-1 agns do not show similar ( emission line ) spectra anymore than all stars show similar ( absorption line ) spectra .",
    "differences go beyond source - to source comparisons and include significant differences between median spectra of large numbers binned in a context like 4de1 .",
    "we now suspect that eddington ratio , central black hole mass , orientation and metallicity  parameters that could define a 4d physical space related to accretion properties of the central supermassive black hole , the process that is believed to power the tremendous energy output of quasars  all likely affect the observed source spectra .",
    "the 4de1 formalism has reduced interpretative confusion and assisted the interpretation of several observational aspects that appear puzzling if , for example , sets of spectra are indiscriminately averaged together @xcite .",
    "spectra can be averaged but only in a well defined context like 4de1 .",
    "an obvious indication that not all quasars are the same in terms of physical and dynamical properties comes from the difference between optical spectral properties of narrow line seyfert 1 sources ( nlsy1s ) ( which can be luminous quasars ) and radio - loud quasars ( a less extreme difference is shown in fig . 2 of @xcite ) . in the former",
    "we observe narrow low ionization lines dominated by  emission vs. broad multi - component ( redward asymmetric ) lines in an overall higher ionization spectrum .",
    "the systematic differences are recognized by several authors who speak , emphasizing different aspects , of nlsy1s and broad(er ) line quasars ( blqs ) , of population a and b @xcite , population 1 and 2 @xcite or disk- and wind - dominated sources @xcite . in this review",

    "sources belonging to the same spectral type show similar spectroscopic measures ( e.g. , line profiles and line flux ratios ) .",
    "they are assumed to isolate sources with similar broad line physics and geometry .",
    "systematic changes are minimized ( although they may not be fully random @xcite ) within each spectral type so that an individual quasar can be taken as representative of all sources within a given spectral bin .",

    "b : ( 3 ) a very - broad line region ( vblr ) that accounts for the innermost emission and for the prominent redward asymmetries observed in the line profile of these sources .",
