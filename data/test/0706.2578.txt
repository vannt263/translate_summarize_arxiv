    "one of the goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite is the discovery of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "the squark and gluino decays produce missing transverse energy @xmath9 from lightest stable superparticle ( lsp ) plus multiple jets and isolated leptons @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting and widely discussed signatures for susy discovery at the lhc is the signature with two opposite charge and the same flavour leptons @xcite : @xmath10 .",
    "the main reason of such interest is that neutralino decays into leptons and lsp @xmath11 contribute to this signature and the distribution of the @xmath12 invariant mass @xmath13 has the edge structure @xcite that allows to determine some combination of the susy masses .",
    "the signature @xmath14 can be realized when @xmath15 decays into @xmath16 pair which is only relevant at large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "also as it is shown in ref.@xcite at the level of cmsjet @xcite simulation the use of @xmath17 signature for large @xmath3 allows to obtain nontrivial information on parameters of the decay @xmath18 . on the other hand , the @xmath14 ( with an arbitrary number of jets )",
    "can be used for the detection of lepton flavour violation in slepton decays @xcite , @xcite at the lhc .    in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite supersymmetry is broken at some high scale @xmath19 by generic soft terms , so in general all soft susy breaking terms are arbitrary which complicates the analysis and spoils the predictive power of the theory . in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra )",
    "@xcite the universality of the different soft parameters at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath20  gev is postulated .",
    "namely , all the spin zero particle masses ( squarks , sleptons , higgses ) are postulated to be equal to the universal value @xmath21 at the gut scale .",
    "all gaugino particle masses are postulated to be equal to the universal value @xmath22 at gut scale .",
    "also the coefficients in front of quadratic and cubic susy soft breaking terms are postulated to be equal .",
    "the renormalization group equations are used to relate gut and electroweak scales .",
    "the equations for the determination of a nontrivial minimum of the electroweak potential are used to decrease the number of the unknown parameters by two .",
    "so the msugra model depends on five unknown parameters . at present , the more or less standard choice of free parameters in the msugra model includes @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "all sparticle masses depend on these parameters .    in ref.@xcite the possibility to detect susy and lepton flavour violation using the @xmath25 signature at the lhc for the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector at the level of full detector simulation",
    "was studied .",
    "note also ref.@xcite where the susy msugra cms detector discovery potential was investigated for the @xmath26 signature at the level of full detector simulation .",
    "in this paper we study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signatures @xmath2 for different values of @xmath27 in the msugra model . with @xmath28 rising ,",
    "we observe a characteristic change in the shape of dilepton mass spectra in @xmath4 versus @xmath5 final states reflecting the decrease of @xmath6 branching ratio .",
    "we also study the non msugra modifications of the cms test point lm1 with arbitrary relations among gaugino and higgsino masses . for such modifications of the msugra test point",
    "the number of lepton events depends rather strongly on the relations among gaugino and higgsino masses and in some modifications of test point lm1 the signatures with leptons and @xmath7 do not lead to the susy discovery and the single susy discovery signature remains the signature with @xmath8 .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ tede ] describes some useful technical details of performed simulations . in section [ basi ]",
    "the backgrounds and cuts used to suppress the backgrounds are discussed .",
    "section [ resca ] contains the results of numerical calculations concerning the possibility to detect susy and constrain the susy parameters using the @xmath29 and @xmath26 signatures .",
    "section [ ressim ] contains the results of the simulations for different values of @xmath28 . in section [ ressim2 ]",
    "we discuss the results of the simulation of the mssm with nonuniversal gaugino and higgsino masses .",
    "section [ conc ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "the coupling constants and cross sections in the leading order ( lo ) approximation for susy processes and backgrounds were calculated with isasugra 7.69 @xcite , pythia 6.227 @xcite and comphep 4.2pl @xcite . for the calculation of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the susy",
    "cross sections the prospino @xcite code was used . for considered signal events and backgrounds",
    "the nlo corrections are known and the values of nlo cross sections ( or @xmath30-factors ) were used for normalization of the numerical results .",
    "we used the full simulation results of ref.@xcite for the estimation of the number of background events .",
    "the cms fast simulation code @xmath31 @xcite was used for the estimation of signal events .",
    "the reconstructed electrons and muons were passed through packages defining lepton isolation criteria . for each electron and muon",
    "the following parameters were defined :    * @xmath32 is a number of additional tracks with @xmath33 2  gev/@xmath34 inside a cone with @xmath35 0.3 around the lepton .",
    "* @xmath36 is a ratio of energy deposited in the calorimeters ( electromagnetic ( ecal ) + hadronic ( hcal ) ) inside a cone with @xmath37 around given track to the energy deposited inside a cone with @xmath38 .",
    "* @xmath39 is defined as a ratio of energy deposited in the hcal inside a cone with @xmath40 to the energy deposited in the ecal inside the same cone .",
    "* @xmath41 is a ratio of energy deposited in the ecal inside a cone with @xmath40 to the momentum of the reconstructed track .",
    "the susy production @xmath42 with subsequent decays @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 lead to the event topologies @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that in the mssm with lepton flavour conservation neutralino decays into leptons @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) do not contribute into the @xmath0 signature .",
    "the main backgrounds which contribute to the @xmath5 events are : @xmath49 , ww , wz , zz , wt , z@xmath50 , @xmath51 and z+jet . it is found that @xmath49 is the largest background and it gives more than 50% contribution to the total background . in this paper",
    "we used the results of ref.@xcite for the estimation of the number of background events .    in the analysis the events with the following isolation criteria for electrons were used : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the same criteria for muons were the following : @xmath52 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "these numbers were adjusted by studying electron and muon tracks in the process @xmath59 .",
    "the selection cuts are the following :    *   cut on leptons : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , lepton isolation within @xmath62 cone    *   cut on missing transverse energy : @xmath63 .    here @xmath64 and @xmath65 are corresponding thresholds",
    "in this section we remind the main results of ref.@xcite on susy detection using the @xmath25 signature .",
    "the possibility to detect susy using the cms test points lm1 - lm9 @xcite chosen for the detailed study of susy detection at the cms was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "this study was based on the counting the expected number of events for both the standard model ( sm ) and the msugra model .",
    "the parameters of the cms test points lm1 - lm9 are given in table [ points ] .    .",
    "the parameters of the cms test points . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ leptons ]    as it follows from table [ leptons ] for points ( 7 - 12 ) the perspective to discover susy using the signature with single lepton or dileptons plus @xmath9 looks hopeless .",
    "moreover for the points ( 7 - 12 ) the use of more powerful from the susy discovery point of view signature @xmath66 also looks very problematic .",
    "the invariant mass distributions of @xmath12 ( solid line ) and @xmath5 ( dotted line ) lepton pairs at the extensions of the point lm1 are shown in figs.[pm2_minvbsm4]-[pm2mu_minvbsm4 ] .",
    "the distributions of @xmath67 leptons , @xmath68 lepton , @xmath69 leptons and @xmath70 leptons on @xmath9 for the modifications of the point lm1 are shown in figs.[ppx4425 ] - [ pl02x102 ] for an integral luminosity @xmath71 .",
    "as one can see from fig.[ppx4425 ] for the points ( 7 - 10 ) there is sharp change in lepton spectra distributions on @xmath9 compared to the test point lm1 , namely , the number of lepton events for the points ( 7 - 10 ) are much smaller than for the test point lm1 .",
    "the same situation takes place for the @xmath9 spectrum of events without leptons , see fig.[pl02x4425 ] .",
    "in this paper we studied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signatures @xmath2 for different parameters @xmath3 of the mssm model . with @xmath3 rising",
    ", we observed a characteristic change in the shape of dilepton mass spectra in @xmath4 versus @xmath5 final states reflecting the decrease of @xmath6 branching ratio .",
    "we also studied some non msugra modifications of the point lm1 .",
    "we have found the drastic change in dilepton spectra with the increase of gaugino masses .",
    "for the points ( 7 - 12 ) the perspective to discover susy using the signatures with leptons and @xmath9 looks hopeless",
    ". even more powerful signature with @xmath72 looks rather pessimistic .        as a recent review ,",
