    "single trapped ion provides the cleanest quantum system available in nature . in the past decade or more ,",
    "trapped ions has been used in a variety of scenarios , from developing atomic clocks in the optical domain @xcite to implementing protocols required for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it also provides a test bed for measurement of various fundamental properties of quantum mechanics and quantum field theories , such as parity non - conservation and measurements on limits of electron electric dipole moment@xcite as well as time variation of fundamental constants of nature@xcite .",
    "+ geometric phases in general and berry phase in particular has been studied for a variety of physical systems and conditions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of geometric phases has been generalized for composite systems having internal structure particularly in the light of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "this has practical importance from the view point of systemic effects associated with rotating electric and magnetic fields in precision experiments @xcite .",
    "however , higher order multipole effects has not been considered except for a few cases like the nuclear quadrupole resonances in a rotating frame @xcite where frequency shift in the nqr spectrum due to berry phase has been observed . in this work",
    ", we put forward a proposal for the measurement of berry phases and berry phase generated energy shifts using single trapped ion .",
    "the ion trap experiment will not only provide observable energy shift but also a clean and controlled measurement to understand the geometric phase in abelian and non - abelian cases . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this has so far not been explored either theoretically or experimentally . in a way",
    ", this proposal allows one to simulate a situation when a quantum system changes from one symmetry to another symmetry . in either regime",
    "the berry phases may be used to implement various noise tolerant quantum gates , which form the heart of quantum computation , without the complexity of using lasers .",
    "+ in this work , we show that we can generate berry phase and its associated energy shifts using modified ion trap geometry .",
    "we also present a convenient technique for calculation of berry phases in situations involving electric quadrupole moment interacting with a time dependent electric field gradient .",
    "berry phase is a phase acquired by the eigenstates of a hamiltonian , which is changing with time implicitly in an adiabatic fashion @xcite in a parameter space so that the system remains in the same eigenstate during the entire evolution , _ i.e. _ the time dependence does not lead to a transition in the system . for adiabatic condition to hold , time scale of the change must be less than any other relevant time scale of the system .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the adiabatic evolution of a system can be written as    @xmath0    where the time dependence comes through the parameter @xmath1 . under such time evolution ,",
    "the total wavefunction is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the berry phase acquired in time @xmath4 by the @xmath5 eigenstate and @xmath6 is the corresponding eigenvalue . for a periodic time evolution of the hamiltonian ( which is the most practical of experimentally viable scenarios )",
    ", the berry phase acquired by the @xmath7th eigenstate is given by    @xmath8    where the integration is carried over the path traversed in the parameter space .",
    "+      the phase of the wavefunction in eq .",
    "[ fullwf ] in the linear approximation of variation of berry phase with time due to adiabatic change can be re - written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the berry phase acquired in one cycle with a time period @xmath11 . + as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ modphase ] , the eigenvalue of the system gets modified by @xmath12 .",
    "thus in presence of a periodically evolving time dependent hamiltonian , adiabatic in nature , the energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian gets modified depending on the acquired phase and the time period of the cyclical evolution .",
    "in this work we propose a concrete experiment where we can observe such phase dependent energy shifts using a single trapped ion . the trap is modified to impose a cyclic hamiltonian on the ion and we can observe the resultant shift in the electronic levels of the trapped ion .",
    "the interaction by which we propose to impose such a time dependent hamiltonian is the interaction of the quadrupole moment of some chosen electronic levels with a time dependent electric field gradient , provided by a modified trap geometry . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only experimental observation of similar splitting and shift has been by r. tycko who used a single crystal of kclo@xmath13 , where the crystal field gradient interacted with the nuclear quadrupole moment and the time dependence has been incorporated by mechanical rotation of the crystal . the proposed experiment using a single trapped ion",
    "however is fundamentally different in two ways .",
    "first , the electronic state of the ion allows the manipulation of the hamiltonian by light field .",
    "second , the presence or absence of static magnetic field allows the system to change between abelian and non - abelian geometry .",
    "this transition from one regime to another has so far not been studied either experimentally or theoretically .",
    "+      for the generation of a berry phase , we need a time dependent field gradient and a system with a quadrupole moment . in this case the time dependent field gradient is provided by the modified trap design .",
    "+ the quadrupole moment can be defined as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 corresponds to the k@xmath16 component of the spin and @xmath17 is a numeric constant .",
    "the hamiltonian of the interaction is given as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the @xmath20the component of the electric field gradient tensor .",
    "now , we first move into the frame of the field gradient and define the @xmath21-axis along the field gradient tensor . in that case , the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath22    where the pre - factor @xmath23 contains the value of the electric field gradient and the quadrupole moment of the state under study .",
    "assuming a spin @xmath24 state , which is relevant , as the experimental system we are interested in is the @xmath25 state of a trapped ba+ ion , the eigenvalues for this hamiltonian are @xmath26 and @xmath27 with each of them being doubly degenerate due to kramers degeneracy . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the first set of doubly degenerate eigenstates and @xmath30 and @xmath31 consists of the second set .",
    "the value of alpha will depend on the value of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath25 of ba@xmath32 ion @xcite , as well as the magnitude of the components of electric field gradient .",
    "now to transform back to the laboratory frame , we apply the wigner d - matrices .",
    "transformation to the laboratory frame consists of a rotation of @xmath33 along the z - axis and then @xmath34 along the rotated y axis and the third rotation being a null rotation .",
    "the time dependence comes from @xmath35 . applying the wigner matrices and using eq .",
    "[ bqeq ] , we obtain the following berry phases for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian     is the time dependent parameter leading to rotation of the principle axis w.r.t .",
    "lab z - axis , title=\"fig : \" ] +    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 signify the states @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "+ the constants of integration are so chosen as to ensure zero phase for @xmath45 . thus incorporating the phase dependent energy shifts",
    ", we obtain the energies of the eigenstates as    @xmath46    thus the eigenvectors split depending on the berry phase of each of the states as well as the frequency of rotation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the berry phase itself is independent of any external field value but only depends on the geometry of the rotation axis with respect to the quantization axis .",
    "this is not surprising since this phase is a purely geometric in nature and is potentially applicable to perform fault tolerant quantum information processing .",
    "+       and resultant field gradient @xmath47 , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the proposal is based on the fact that a potential tilted with respect to the trap axis ( @xmath48 ) can give rise to a field gradient whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the trap symmetry axes as shown in fig [ potgrad].however it has ben shown by our calculation and also in ref @xcite that the main contributing component is the @xmath49 component .",
    "it can be proved by taking the potential @xmath50 and calculating the hamiltonian of quadrupole interaction .",
    "hence for simplicity , we consider only the @xmath49 component of the field gradient matrix to be non - zero with the other components to be zero .",
    "the proof of the fact that a tilted potential can give rise to a tilted field gradient will be obvious by calculating the field gradient matrix from a potential @xmath51 and comparing it with a matrix obtained by rotating the basis of a gradient matrix with only @xmath52 component and representing it in the trap basis , i.e. @xmath53 with euler angles @xmath54,@xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus the design goal is to have electrode geometry which can produce a parabolic potential rotating about the linear trap axis .",
    "it can be established using a four rod structure for the end caps in a linear paul trap and applying rf voltages on diagonally opposite end cap rods across the body . as is demonstrated in figure [ trapgeo ] , by connecting body diagonally opposite end cap rods ( e.g. @xmath57 and @xmath38 ) and applying suitably phase shifted rf voltage on each of the four pair of end cap rods ( @xmath58 ) , it is possible to rotate a parabolic potential about the trap axis @xcite , leading to rotation of the field gradient about the axis of symmetry .",
    "+     +    here we will show that such a distorted trap indeed leads to a tilted potential .",
    "we simulate the trap potential , given its geometry and the rotating time dependent potential , using simion 7.0 and plot the three components of the electric field for a position , off axis from the trap center ( exactly at the trap center the field is zero ) .",
    "also we plot the electric field as obtained theoretically by taking the gradient of the potential @xmath48 .",
    "the electric field components , @xmath59,@xmath60 and @xmath61 are plotted as functions of each other in a three dimensional graph as a phase diagram and the two situations are compared , fig .",
    "[ sim_elec ] and fig .",
    "[ trap_elec ] .",
    "+     +     +    as can be seen there are certain differences between the two figures .",
    "they arise out of the fact that even though @xmath48 assumes a @xmath62 and @xmath63 symmetry , the actual trap does not have so and hence it can lead to the difference that is observed .",
    "the value of @xmath55 has been taken as @xmath64 for generating the first graph .",
    "this value corresponds to the angle a straight line , connecting the middle of two diagonally opposite rods , makes with the trap axis .",
    "hence we can assume that the trap creates a sort of a distorted parabola when the above mentioned potential is applied to the end caps .",
    "+ to obtain the true form of the potential in the case of the actual trap geometry , the potential along the diagonal is plotted for two values of the endcap voltages @xmath65v and @xmath66v respectively ( fig .",
    "[ pot500 ] ) .",
    "a fourth order polynomial has been fitted in both the cases .",
    "+     for end cap voltage of 500 and 1000.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the fitting parameters show that as the voltages of the end caps are increased , the parabolic nature of the potentials also increase .",
    "however , the berry phase and the resultant energy difference is independent of the magnitude of the field gradient and hence it should not affect the splitting of the levels .",
    "+ the frequency of rotation however has to be very slow .",
    "this is because , to maintain the adiabatic condition , the precession frequency has be much smaller than the level splitting caused by the hamiltonian itself .",
    "as an example , for ca ion , the splitting is of the order of @xmath67 hz for an electric field gradient of about @xmath68v / mm@xmath69@xcite .",
    "since the quadrupole moment of ba@xmath32 is almost double that of ca@xmath32 @xcite , hence we can assume that given similar gradient magnitudes , the splitting will be of the order of @xmath70 hz and the rotation frequency should be much less than that . for such low frequencies , it will not affect the motion of ions in the trap as the relevant trap frequencies are of the order of mhz .",
    "from the point of view of abelian and non - abelian physics , this system can provide insights into transition from abelian to non - abelian situations .",
    "for example , when abelian situation is there , that is the states are degenerate , the phase acquired by the @xmath30 and @xmath31 sub - states of the @xmath71 state are @xmath72 , whereas if they non - degenerate , for example , by applying small symmetry breaking magnetic field , the phases should become @xmath73 .",
    "this is because of the prescription by wilczek and zee @xcite where the off diagonal terms of the phase matrix are considered only if the states are non - degenerate . if there is a physical manifestation of it , then for the abelian and non - abelian scenario , the phase dependent energy shifts will be different .",
    "in this article we have shown that an ion trap with a modified geometry can be used to generate observable splitting which are purely geometric in nature , on meta - stable d - states of ions .",
    "the advantage of using the electric quadrupole moment is that it will lead to selective splitting , occurring only for states which have quadrupole moments .",
    "the geometric nature of the acquired phases as well as the state specificity of the phases make this system quite attractive for quantum information processing .",
    "this type of shifts can be considered as possible systematic in precision experiments dealing with rotating fields and their gradients . as a conclusion",
    "the proposed experiment is the first direct attempt to test quantum physics in an interface of two symmetries namely , abelian and non - abelian .",
    "the authors would like to thank sir m.v .",
    "berry for many useful discussions regarding berry phase .",
    "ddm and mm would also like to thank dst , india for financial support ."
