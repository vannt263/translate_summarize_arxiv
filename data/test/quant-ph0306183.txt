    "grover s search algorithm  @xcite provides an example of the speed - up that would be offered by quantum computers , if and when they are built .",
    "the problem solved by grover s algorithm is finding a sought - after ( `` marked '' ) element in an unsorted database of size @xmath0 . to solve this problem ,",
    "a classical computer would need @xmath1 database queries on average , and in the worst case it would need @xmath2 queries . using grover s algorithm ,",
    "a quantum computer can find the marked state using only @xmath3 quantum database queries .",
    "the importance of grover s result stems from the fact that it proves the existence of a gap ( albeit a polynomial gap ) between the power of quantum computers and classical computers .",
    "moreover , the algorithm may be used to speed up the solution of many problems ( such as np - complete problems ) , for which no efficient classical algorithms is known .    along this paper",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an integer .",
    "the algorithm requires a register of @xmath5 qubits carrying the computation .",
    "when we say it is in a state @xmath6 , we mean that its qubits are in states corresponding to the binary representation of the number @xmath7 .",
    "grover s original quantum search algorithm consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "initialize the register to @xmath8 .",
    "that is , reset all the qubits to 0 and apply the hadamard transform to each of them .",
    "2 .   repeat the following operation ( named the _ grover iterate _",
    "@xmath9 ) @xmath10 times : 1 .",
    "rotate the marked state @xmath11 by a phase of @xmath12 radians @xmath13 .",
    "[ alg : marked ] 2 .",
    "apply the hadamard transform to the register .",
    "3 .   rotate the @xmath14 state by a phase of @xmath12 radians @xmath15 .",
    "[ alg : pivot ] 4 .",
    "apply the hadamard transform again .",
    "3 .   measure the resulting state .",
    "several generalizations extended the original grover algorithm .",
    "among these is handling multiple marked states  @xcite , and the initialization of the algorithm in any pure state  @xcite .",
    "another generalization is the replacement of the hadamard transform by any other unitary operation  @xcite . in this way",
    "the algorithm may be used to speed - up many classical decision algorithms and heuristics .",
    "other generalizations use arbitrary rotation angles  @xcite , replace the @xmath16 state from step ( c ) with any other state , or combine all of the above  @xcite .",
    "the rotation angles may be tweaked in order to find a marked state with certainty  @xcite .",
    "the original grover iterate is @xmath17 .",
    "it has been generalized to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an arbitrary unitary operator , @xmath20 is an arbitrary state , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are arbitrary angles , and @xmath23 includes any number of marked states .",
    "we now observe that _ any _ unitary operation @xmath9 has a unitary diagonalization .",
    "therefore , it can be represented as @xmath24 .",
    "this is a further generalization of grover s algorithm , where the state @xmath20 is replaced by a set of states @xmath25 , each of which may have a different rotation angle .",
    "thus , every iterative algorithm is a generalized grover algorithm .    in this paper",
    "we study the case where the generalized grover iterate of  @xcite is applied to a quantum register that is initialized in an arbitrary mixed state .",
    "our study extends and corrects a result from  @xcite .",
    "if the abovementioned search algorithm is used as a procedure by another algorithm , it might be necessary to avoid its first step .",
    "even if the initialization is performed , gate imperfection or external noise might cause the outcome to differ from the exact @xmath26 state .",
    "rather , it may well be some general pure state @xmath27 , which is a superposition of the marked state and the unmarked states .",
    "in addition , the iterate itslef may be imperfect : the hadamard operation might be some other unitary operation @xmath19 ; the rotations of  ( [ alg : marked ] ) and  ( [ alg : pivot ] ) may be in angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( respectively ) , different of @xmath12 ; and the rotated state of step  ( [ alg : pivot ] ) may be a non - zero @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the set of sought - after items , @xmath23 , may include multiple items .",
    "when the parameters of the problem are known , we may follow the results of biham et al .",
    "@xcite , and calculate the probability to measure a marked state @xmath29 as a function of the number of grover iterations @xmath30 : @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the average over time and the amplitude of @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath35 denote that the values depend on the initial state .",
    "however , @xmath36 , which is defined by @xmath37 is independent of the initial state . in a large search problem with @xmath38 , and with the original grover iterate , @xmath39 may be approximated by @xmath40 . with the original initial state @xmath41 studied by grover ,",
    "we re - obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "a mixed state arises when one can not describe the state of a quantum system deterministically , no matter what basis one chooses .",
    "such a condition appears very often when a quantum system is entangled with its environment , while the environment can not be accessed or manipulated .",
    "the state of such a system may be described by a completely - positive trace-1 hermitian density matrix , denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "an equivalent description is an ensemble @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . according to this description ,",
    "the system is in the pure state @xmath48 with probability @xmath49 . when a unitary operation @xmath50 is applied to the mixed state it transforms the state into @xmath51 .",
    "the mixedness of the state does not change , and it may be thought as if @xmath50 transforms each of the components of @xmath52 independently of the others .",
    "extending the argument of section [ sec : arbpure ] , the initial state of the quantum register might not be pure , due to external noise , decoherence or previous manipulations .",
    "instead , the initial state may be some general mixed state @xmath53 . given the description of @xmath54 as an ensemble , all we can say is that the register is in the pure state @xmath48 with probability @xmath49 ( for all @xmath55 s ) .",
    "when the grover algorithm is applied to a register which is in a pure state @xmath56 , the probability to measure the marked state is @xmath57 .",
    "the probability for the register to be in @xmath58 is @xmath49 ( considering the ensemble @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , the total probability to measure the marked state is the weighted average @xmath59 the functions @xmath60 share a sinusoidal form , differing in amplitude and phase , but not in frequency .",
    "they may be thought of as the projections of vectors rotating in frequency @xmath39 , as exemplified by figure [ fig : average ] .",
    "therefore , their weighted sum @xmath61 ( the center of mass of the vectors in the figure ) is a sinusoidal function with the same frequency : @xmath62 while @xmath63    @xmath64    and @xmath65 the probability to measure a marked state reaches its maximum value @xmath66after @xmath67 iterations .",
    "if the algorithm is repeated until success with @xmath68 iterations each time , the expected total time to measure a marked state is @xmath69 since the number of repetition until success is distributed geometrically with parameter @xmath70 .",
    "when the original iterate is used , and a single item is sought after , this reduces to @xmath71 if this value is significantly smaller than the classical expected time @xmath72 , then the quantum algorithm has an advantage .",
    "quantitatively , the expected number of oracle queries that the quantum algorithm requires is smaller by a factor of @xmath73",
    "for clarity and simplicity , our examples use the original grover iterate and single marked state @xmath11 , with different initial mixed states .",
    "when the arbitrary mixed state is chosen to be pure , the summations are degenerated and the results of  @xcite are achieved . for example , if the initial state is the original @xmath74 , the original grover case is found . if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "an interesting known property of the grover algorithm is that for all states orthogonal to both @xmath78 and @xmath8 , @xmath79 .",
    "ensembles where a state @xmath80 appears with probability @xmath81 and any state orthogonal to it appears with equal probabilities of @xmath82 are called pseudo - pure mixed states .",
    "they are written more conveniently as @xmath83 .",
    "notice that @xmath84 is a measure of the purity of @xmath44 : when @xmath85 it is totally mixed , and when @xmath86 it is totally pure .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit of large @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for example , for @xmath91 we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "notice that although @xmath44 is extremely mixed , the quantum advantage is of factor @xmath94 .",
    "let us study the case where the register is initialized to @xmath96 .",
    "this state may occur if the @xmath97 least significant qubits of the register are totally mixed before the first hadamard transform is applied . since all @xmath98 are orthogonal to @xmath8 ( except for @xmath8 itself ) and they are almost orthogonal to @xmath78 ( since @xmath99 ) , the evolution of @xmath100 is governed by @xmath101 and we obtain @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "large @xmath95 would render the algorithm useless .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a mixed state @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105 .",
    "bose et al .",
    "@xcite presented a new model for quantum computation and laid out a new proof for the optimality of the grover algorithm .",
    "however , one of their results was the following : if the grover algorithm is initiated with a mixed state @xmath104 , such that @xmath106 , the algorithm would have no advantage comparing to the classical case .",
    "this is in disagreement with our findings  @xcite .",
    "a counter - example to their claim is @xmath107 as defined above .",
    "the entropy of pseudo - pure state is @xmath108 where @xmath109 for any @xmath110 and any @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 we obtain @xmath113 .",
    "this entropy is almost maximal .",
    "however , as noted above , the grover algorithm outperforms any classical algorithm , even when it is initialized with this state .",
    "entropy is not a good measure for the usefulness of grover s algorithm . for practically every value of entropy ,",
    "there exist states that are good initializers and states that are not .",
    "for example , @xmath114 , but when initialized in @xmath115 , the grover algorithm is as bad as guessing the marked state .",
    "another example may be given using the pure states @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "with the first , grover arrives to the marked state with quadratic speed - up , while the second state is practically unchanged by the algorithm .",
    "we thank tal mor for valuable discussions and suggestions that made the compiling of this paper possible .",
    "the work was partially supported by the european commission through the ist programme under contract ist-1999 - 11234 .",
    "the first author was partially supported by the fund for the promotion of research at the technion and the israel mod research and technology unit .",
    "bose et al .",
    "have a mistake regarding the entropy of the _ classical _ search problem . just above their equation",
    "( 10 ) , they say that classical search can change entropy by @xmath118 in @xmath119 steps .",
    "this is true for a search field of size @xmath119 , but wrong for the question in matter where the search field is of size @xmath87 .",
    "this mistake does not invalidate the other results in their paper ."
