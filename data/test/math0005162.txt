    "this paper is a detailed version of my preprint @xcite , which was written about five years ago . here",
    "i do not discuss results that have appeared since then .",
    "i plan to survey them soon in another paper .",
    "the subject is now evolving into a _ real algebraic knot theory_.    this paper is dedicated to the memory of my teacher vladimir abramovich rokhlin .",
    "it was v.  a.  rokhlin , who suggested to me , a long time ago , in 1977 , to develop a theory of real algebraic knots .",
    "he suggested this as a topic for my second dissertation ( after phd , like habilitation ) . following this suggestion",
    ", i moved then from knot theory and low - dimensional topology to the topology of real algebraic varieties .",
    "however , in the topology of real algebraic varieties , problems on spatial surfaces and plane curves were more pressing than problems on spatial curves , and my second dissertation defended in 1983 was devoted to the constructions of real algebraic plane curves and spatial surfaces with prescribed topology .",
    "the change in the topic occured mainly because i managed to obtain decent results in another direction , on plane curves .",
    "there was also a less respectable reason : i failed to relate the traditional techniques of classical knot theory to real algebraic knots .",
    "one of the obstacles was a phenomenon which became the initial point of this paper .",
    "a large part of the traditional techniques in knot theory uses plane knot diagrams , i.e. , projections of knots to the plane .",
    "the projection of an algebraic curve is algebraic , and one could try to apply results on plane real algebraic curves",
    ". however , the projection contains extra real points , which do not correspond to real points of the knot .",
    "these points are discussed below . in the seventies they ruined my weak attempts to study real algebraic knots .",
    "now they allow us to detect crucial differences between topological and real algebraic knots .",
    "i am grateful to alan durfee , tobias ekholm , and v.  m.  kharlamov for stimulating conversations .    the lengthy informal introduction , which follows , is intended to explain the matter prior to going into details .",
    "i can not resist the temptation to write in the style of popular mathematics and apologize to the reader whom this style may irritate .      in classical knot theory , by a link one",
    "means a smooth closed @xmath2-dimensional submanifold of the @xmath0-dimensional sphere @xmath3 , i.e. , the union of several disjoint circles smoothly embedded into @xmath3 .",
    "a link may be equipped with various additional structures such as orientation or framing and considered up to various equivalence relations like smooth ( or ambient ) isotopy , pl - isotopy , cobordism or homotopy .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .    in algebraic geometry",
    "classical links naturally appear as links of singular points of complex plane algebraic curves . given a singular point @xmath4 of a complex plane algebraic curve @xmath5 , the intersection of @xmath5 with the boundary of a sufficiently small ball centered at @xmath4 is called the _ link of the singularity_. it provides a base for a fruitful interaction between topology and algebraic geometry with a long history and lots of important results .    another obvious opportunity for interaction between algebraic geometry and knot theory",
    "is based on the fact that a classical link may emerge as the set of real points of a real algebraic curve .",
    "this opportunity was completely ignored , besides that a number of times it was proved that any classical link is approximated by ( and hence isotopic to ) the set of real points of a real algebraic curve .",
    "there are two natural directions in which algebraic geometry and knot theory may interact in the study of real algebraic links : first , the study of relationships between invariants which are provided by link theory and algebraic geometry , second , developing a theory parallel to the classical link theory , but taking into account the algebraic nature of the objects .",
    "from the viewpoint of this second direction , it is more natural to consider real algebraic links up to isotopy consisting of real algebraic links , which belong to the same continuous family of algebraic curves , rather than up to smooth isotopy in the class of classical links .",
    "i call an isotopy of the former kind a _ rigid isotopy _ , following the terminology established by rokhlin @xcite in a similar study of real algebraic plane projective curves and the likes ( see , e.g. , the survey @xcite ) .",
    "of course , there is a forgetting functor : any real algebraic link can be regarded as a classical link and a rigid isotopy as a smooth isotopy .",
    "it is interesting to see how much is lost under that transition .    in this paper",
    "i point out a real algebraic link invariant which is lost .",
    "it is unexpectedly simple . in an obvious sense it is a nontrivial vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2 on the class of real algebraic knots (",
    "recall that a knot is a link consisting of one component ) . in classical knot theory",
    "the lowest degree of a nontrivial vassiliev knot invariant is @xmath6 .",
    "thus there is an essential difference between classical knot theory and the theory of real algebraic knots .",
    "of course this difference has a simple topological explanation : a real algebraic link is more complicated topologically , besides its set of real points contains the set of complex points invariant under the complex conjugation and a rigid isotopy induces an equivariant smooth isotopy of this set .",
    "the invariant of real algebraic links which is defined below is very similar to the self - linking number of a framed knot .",
    "in @xcite i call it also the _ self - linking number_. its definition looks like a replacement of an elementary definition of the writhe of a knot diagram , but taking into consideration the imaginary part of the knot .      here",
    "i propose to change this name ( i.e. , self - linking number ) to _ encomplexed writhe _ , and , in general , since many other characteristics can also be enhanced in a similar way , i suggest a new verb _",
    "encomplex _ for similar enhancements by taking into consideration additional imaginary ingredients .",
    "this would agree with the general usage of the prefix _",
    "en- _ which is described in the oxford dictionary of current english as follows : `` en- _ prefix _",
    "@xmath7 forming verbs @xmath7 * 1 * from nouns , meaning ` put into or on ' ( _ engulf ; entrust ; embed _ ) , * 2 * from nouns or adjectives , meaning ` bring into the condition of ' ( _ enslave _ ) @xmath7 '' .",
    "complexification _ does not seem to be appropriate for what we do here with the writhe .",
    "a complexification of the writhe should be a complex counterpart for the writhe , it should be a characteristic of complex objects , while our enhancement of the writhe is defined only for real objects possessing complexification .",
    "the linking number is a well - known numerical characteristic of a pair of disjoint oriented circles embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space . roughly speaking",
    ", it measures how many times one of the circles runs around the other .",
    "it is one of the most classical topological invariants , introduced in the nineteenth century by gauss @xcite .    in the classical theory ,",
    "a self - linking number of a knot is defined if the knot is equipped with an additional structure like a framing or just a vector field nowhere tangent to the knot .",
    "the self - linking number is the linking number of the knot oriented somehow and its copy obtained by a small shift in the direction specified by the vector field .",
    "it does not depend on the orientation , since reversing the orientation of the knot is compensated by reversing the induced orientation of its shifted copy .",
    "of course , the self - linking number depends on the homotopy class of the vector field .",
    "a knot has no natural preferable homotopy class of framings , which would allow us to speak about a self - linking number of the knot without a special care on the choice of the framing .",
    "some framings appear naturally in geometric situations .",
    "for example , if one fixes a generic projection of a knot to a plane , the vector field of directions of the projection appears . the corresponding self - linking number is called the _ writhe _ of the knot .",
    "however , it depends on the choice of the projection and changes under isotopy .",
    "the linking number is a vassiliev invariant of order @xmath2 of two - component oriented links .",
    "this means that it changes by a constant ( in fact , by @xmath6 ) when the link experiences a homotopy with the generic appearance of an intersection point of the components . whether the linking number increases or decreases depends only on the local picture of orientations near the double point : when it passes from @xmath8{fo1.eps}}}$ ] through @xmath9{fo2.eps}}}$ ] to @xmath9{fo3.eps}}}$ ] , the linking number increases by @xmath6 .",
    "generalities on vassiliev invariants see , e.g. , in @xcite .    in a sense",
    "the linking number is the only vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2 of two - component oriented links : any vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2 of two - component oriented links is a linear function of the linking number .",
    "similarly , the self - linking number is a vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2 of framed knots ( it changes by @xmath6 when the knot experiences a homotopy with a generic appearance of a self - intersection point ) and it is the only vassiliev of degree @xmath2 of framed knots in the same sense . the necessity of a framing for the definition of self - linking number can now be formulated more rigorously : only constants are vassiliev invariants of degree @xmath2 of ( non - framed ) knots .",
    "the diagrammatical definition of the writhe , which is imitated below , runs as follows : for each crossing point of the knot projection , one defines a _ local writhe _ equal to @xmath10 if near the point the knot diagram looks like @xmath9{fo3.eps}}}$ ] and @xmath1 if it looks like @xmath8{fo1.eps}}}$ ] .",
    "then one sums the local writhes over all double points of the projection .",
    "the sum is the writhe .",
    "a continuous change of the projection may cause the vanishing of a crossing point .",
    "this happens under the first reidemeister move shown in the left hand half of figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "this move changes the writhe by @xmath11 .      if a link is algebraic , then its projection to a plane is algebraic , too .",
    "a generic projection has only ordinary double points and the total number of its complex double points is constant .",
    "the number of real double points can vary , but only by an even number .",
    "a real double point can not turn alone into an imaginary one , as it seems to happen under the first reidemeister move . under an algebraic version of the first reidemeister move",
    ", the double point stays in the real domain , but becomes solitary , like the only real point of the curve @xmath12 .",
    "the algebraic version of the first reidemeister move is shown in the right hand half of figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the family of spatial curves that realizes this move can be transformed by a local diffeomorphism to the family of affine curves defined by the following system of equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the parameter of the deformation .",
    "these are rational curves , admitting a rational parametrization @xmath15 the projection corresponds to the standard projection @xmath16 to the coordinate @xmath17-plane .",
    "it maps these curves to the family of affine plane rational cubic curves defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "a solitary double point of the projection is not the image of any real point of the link .",
    "it is the image of two imaginary complex conjugate points of the complexification of the link .",
    "the preimage of the point in the 3-space under the projection is a real line .",
    "it is disjoint from the real part of the link , but intersects its complexification in a couple of complex conjugate imaginary points .    in the model of the first reidemeister move above",
    ", @xmath20 is the double point of the projection for each @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 , it is a usual crossing point .",
    "its preimage consists of two real points @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , it is a solitary double point .",
    "its preimage consists of two imaginary conjugate points @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which lie on a real line @xmath28    below , in section [ s0.3 ] , with any solitary double point of the projection , a local writhe equal to @xmath29 is associated .",
    "this is done in such a way that the local writhe of the crossing point vanishing in the first reidemeister move is equal to the local writhe of the new - born solitary double point . in the case of an algebraic knot ,",
    "the sum of local writhes of all double points , both solitary and crossings , does not depend on the choice of projection and is invariant under rigid isotopy .",
    "this sum is the encomplexed writhe .",
    "a  construction similar to the construction of the encomplexed writhe number of an algebraic knot can be applied to an algebraic _ link_. however in this case there are two versions of the construction .    in the first of these",
    ", we define an encomplexed writhe number generalizing the encomplexed writhe number defined above for knots .",
    "we consider a link diagram and the sum of local writhes at solitary double points and crossing points where the branches belong the same connected component of the set of real points . at these crossing point , to define a local writhe , we need orientations of the branches . as",
    "above , we choose an orientation on each of the components . if we make another choice , at a crossing point for which the branches belong the same component , either both orientations change or none .",
    "hence the local writhe numbers at crossing points of this kind do not depend on the choice . in section [ s0.1 ]",
    "below , we prove that the whole sum of local writhes over crossing points of this kind and solitary double points does not depend on the projection and is invariant under rigid isotopy .",
    "we call this sum the _ encomplexed writhe number _ of the link @xmath30 and denote by @xmath31 .    in the second version of the construction , we consider a real algebraic link which is equipped with an orientation of the set of real points , use these orientations to define local writhe numbers at all crossing points and sum the local writhe numbers over all crossing points and all solitary double points .",
    "the result is called the _",
    "encomplexed writhe number of an oriented real algebraic link_. this encomplexed writhe number does not change when the orientation reverses .",
    "an orientation considered up to reversing is called a _",
    "semi - orientation_. thus the encomplexed writhe number depends only on the semi - orientation of the link .",
    "the ( semi-)orientation may be an artificial extra structure , but it may also appear in a natural way , say , as a complex orientation , if the set of real points divides the set of real points , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , the complex orientation is defined up to reversing , so it is indeed a semi - orientation .",
    "another important class of semi - oriented algebraic links appears as transversal intersections of two real algebraic surfaces of degrees @xmath4 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the encomplexed writhe number of ( semi-)oriented real algebraic link differs from the encomplexed writhe number of the same link without orientation by the sum of all pairwise linking numbers of the components multiplied by @xmath6 : let @xmath30 be a real algebraic link , let @xmath34 be the same link equipped with an orientation of its set of real points and @xmath35 the ( oriented ) connected components of this set , then @xmath36      in the case of a knot , the encomplexed writhe number defines a natural class of framings , since homotopy classes of framings are enumerated by their self - linking numbers and we can choose the framing having the self - linking number equal to the algebraic encomplexed writhe number .",
    "i do not know any direct construction of this framing .",
    "moreover , there seems to be a reason for the absence of such a construction . in the case of links",
    ", the construction above gives a single number , while framings are enumerated by sequences of numbers with entries corresponding to components .",
    "let @xmath30 be a nonsingular real algebraic curve in @xmath0-dimensional projective space .",
    "then the set @xmath37 of its real points is a smooth closed @xmath2-dimensional submanifold of @xmath38 , i.e. , a smooth projective link .",
    "the set @xmath39 of its complex points is a smooth complex @xmath2-dimensional submanifold of @xmath40 .",

    "consider the projection @xmath42 from @xmath41 .",
    "assume that @xmath41 is such that the restriction to @xmath39 of @xmath43 is generic .",
    "this means that it is an immersion without triple points and at each double point the images of the branches have distinct tangent lines .",
    "it follows from well - known theorems that those @xmath41 s for which this is the case form an open dense subset of @xmath38 ( in fact , it is the complement of a @xmath6-dimensional subvariety ) .",
    "the real part @xmath44 of the image consists of the image @xmath45 of the real part and , maybe , several solitary points , which are double points of @xmath46 .",
    "there is a purely topological construction which assigns a local writhe equal to @xmath29 to a crossing belonging to the image of only one component of @xmath37 .",
    "this construction is well - known in the case of classical knots .",

    "the construction of the local writhe of @xmath51 contains several choices .",
    "here is a proof that the result does not depend on them .",
    "we have chosen an orientation of @xmath49 . had the opposite orientation been selected , then @xmath59 and @xmath48 would be replaced by the opposite vectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this would not change the result , since @xmath62 , @xmath47 , @xmath63 defines the same orientation as @xmath59 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",

    "if the other half of @xmath57 was selected , then @xmath47 and @xmath48 would be replaced by the opposite vectors .",

    "the construction depends on the order of points @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the other choice ( with the same choice of the orientation of @xmath49 and segment @xmath58 ) gives a triple of vectors at @xmath55 .",
    "it can be moved continuously without degeneration along @xmath58 into the triple @xmath48 , @xmath64 , @xmath59 , which defines the same orientation as @xmath59 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath30 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 be as in the beginning of section [ s0.1 ] and let @xmath65 be a solitary double point of @xmath43 .",
    "here is a construction assigning @xmath29 to @xmath66 .",
    "i will also call the result a _ local writhe _ of @xmath66 .",
    "denote the preimage of @xmath66 under @xmath43 by @xmath57 .",
    "this is a real line in @xmath38 connecting @xmath41 and @xmath66 .",
    "it intersects @xmath39 in two imaginary complex conjugate points , say , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are conjugate , they belong to different components of @xmath67",
    ".    choose one of the common points of @xmath39 and @xmath68 , say , @xmath54 .",
    "the natural orientation of the component of @xmath67 defined by the complex structure of @xmath68 induces an orientation on @xmath69 as on the boundary of its closure .",
    "the image under @xmath43 of the local branch of @xmath39 passing through @xmath54 intersects the plane of the projection @xmath70 transversally at @xmath66 .",
    "take the local orientation of the plane of projection such that the local intersection number of the plane and the image of the branch of @xmath39 is  @xmath10 .",
    "thus the choice of one of two points of @xmath71 defines an orientation of @xmath69 and a local orientation of the plane of projection @xmath70 ( we can speak only of a local orientation of @xmath70 , since the whole @xmath70 is not orientable ) . the plane of projection intersects .",
    "if you would like to think on it as on the set of lines of @xmath38 passing through @xmath41 , please , identify it in a natural way with any real projective plane contained in @xmath38 and disjoint from @xmath41 .",
    "all such embeddings @xmath72 are isotopic . ]",
    "transversally @xmath69 in @xmath66 .",
    "the local orientation of the plane , the orientation of @xmath69 and the orientation of the ambient @xmath38 determine the intersection number .",
    "this is the local writhe .",
    "it does not depend on the choice of @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , if one chooses @xmath55 instead , then both the orientation of @xmath69 and the local orientation of @xmath70 would be reversed .",
    "the orientation of @xmath73 would be reversed , because @xmath69 inherits opposite orientations from the different halves of @xmath67 .",
    "the local orientation of @xmath70 would be reversed , because the complex conjugation involution @xmath74 preserves the complex orientation of @xmath75 , preserves @xmath70 ( point - wise ) and maps one of the branches of @xmath46 at @xmath66 to the other reversing its complex orientation .",
    "now for any real algebraic projective link @xmath30 , choose a point @xmath76 such that the projection of @xmath30 from @xmath41 is generic and sum the writhes of all crossing points of the projection belonging to the image of only one component of @xmath37 and the writhes of all solitary double points .",
    "this sum is called the _",
    "encomplexed writhe number of @xmath30_.    i have to show that it does not depend on the choice of projection . the proof given below proves more : the sum is invariant under _ rigid isotopy _ of @xmath30 . by rigid isotopy we mean an isotopy consisting of nonsingular real algebraic curves .",
    "the effect of a movement of @xmath41 on the projection can be achieved by a rigid isotopy defined by a path in the group of projective transformations of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the following theorem implies both the independence of the encomplexed writhe number from the choice of projection and its invariance under rigid isotopy .",
    "[ mainth ] for any two rigidly isotopic real algebraic projective links @xmath77 and @xmath78 whose projections from the same point @xmath76 are generic , the encomplexed writhe numbers of @xmath77 and @xmath78 defined via @xmath41 are equal .",
    "this theorem is proved in section [ s0.6 ] .",
    "[ cor1 ] the encomplexed writhe number of a real algebraic projective link does not depend on the choice of the projection involved in its definition .",
    "a projection depends only on the center from which it is done .",
    "the effect on the projection of a movement of the center can be achieved by a rigid isotopy defined by a path in the group of projective transformations of @xmath38 .",
    "thus the encomplexed writhe number is a characteristic of a real algebraic link .",
    "[ cor2 ] the encomplexed writhe number of a real algebraic projective link is invariant under rigid isotopy .          as in the purely topological situation of an isotopy of a classical link , a generic rigid isotopy of a real algebraic link may be decomposed into a composition of rigid isotopies , each of which involves a single local standard move of the projection .",
    "there are @xmath79 local standard moves .",
    "they are similar to the reidemeister moves .",
    "the first of these @xmath79 moves is shown in the right hand half of figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the other moves are shown in figure [ o23 ] .",
    "the first two of these coincide with the second and third reidemeister moves .",
    "the fourth move is similar to the second reidemeister move : also two double points of projection come to each other and disappear .",
    "however the double points are solitary .",
    "the fifth move is similar to the third reidemeister move : a triple point also appears for a moment .",
    "but at this triple point only one branch is real , the other two are imaginary conjugate to each other . in this move a solitary double point traverses a real branch .      to prove theorem [ mainth ] ,",
    "first replace the rigid isotopy by a generic one and then decompose the latter into local moves described above , in section [ s0.5 ] .",
    "only in the first , fourth and fifth moves solitary double points are involved .",
    "the invariance under the second and the third move follows from the well - known fact of knot theory that the topological writhe is invariant under the second and third reidemeister moves .",
    "thus the following three lemmas imply theorem [ mainth ] .",
    "[ lem1 ] in the fifth move the writhe of the solitary point does not change .",
    "[ lem2 ] in the fourth move the writhes of the vanishing solitary points are opposite .",
    "[ lem3 ] in the first move the writhe of vanishing crossing point is equal to the writhe of the new - born solitary point .",
    "proof of lemma [ lem3 ] is postponed to section [ s0.9 ] .",
    "note that although lemma [ lem3 ] is the most difficult to prove , it is the least significant : here its only role is to justify the choice of sign made in the definition of local writhe in solitary double point of the projection .",
    "it is clear that the writhes of vanishing double points involved in the first move are related , and if they were opposite to each other , then the definition of the encomplexed writhe number should be changed , but would not be destroyed irrecoverably .",
    "this is obvious .",
    "indeed , the real branch of the projection does not interact with the imaginary branches , it just passes through their intersection point .",
    "at the moment of the fourth move take a small ball @xmath80 in the complex projective plane centered in the solitary self - tangency point of the projection of the curve .",
    "its intersection with the projection of the complex point set of the curve consists of two smoothly embedded disks tangent to each other and to the disk @xmath81 . under the move each of the disks experiences a diffeotopy . before and after the move the intersection the curve with @xmath80 is the union of the two disks meeting each other transversally in two points , but",
    "before the move the disks do not intersect @xmath70 , while after the move they intersect @xmath70 in their common points .    to calculate the writhe at both vanishing solitary double points ,",
    "let us select the same imaginary branch of the projection of the curve passing through the points .",
    "this means that we select one of the disks described above .",
    "the sum of the local intersection numbers of this disk ( equipped with the complex orientation ) and @xmath81 ( equipped with some orientation ) is zero since under the fourth move the intersection disappears , while in the boundary of @xmath80 no intersection happens .",
    "therefore the local orientations of the projective plane in the vanishing solitary double points defined by this branch define opposite orientations of @xmath81 .",
    "( recall that the local orientations are distinguished by the condition that the local intersection numbers are positive . )    on the other hand , under the move the preimages of the vanishing solitary double points come to each other up to coincidence at the moment of the move and their orientations defined by the choice of the same imaginary branch are carried to the same orientation of the preimage of the point of solitary self - tangency .",
    "indeed , the preimages are real lines and points of intersection of their complexifications with the selected imaginary branch of the curve also come to the same position .",
    "therefore the halves of the complexifications containing the points come to coincidence , as well as the orientations defined by the halves on the real lines .",
    "it follows that the intersection numbers of @xmath80 with the preimages of the vanishing solitary double points equipped with these orientations are equal .",
    "since the local orientations of the projective plane in the vanishing solitary double points define distinct orientations of @xmath81 , the writhes are opposite to each other .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the model family of curves described in section [ si3 ] .",
    "recall that the curves of this family are defined by the following system of equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the parameter of the deformation .",
    "these curves admit a rational parametrization @xmath82 the projection corresponds to the standard projection @xmath16 to the coordinate @xmath17-plane .",
    "it maps these curves to the family of affine plane rational cubic curves defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "we must prove that the local writhe at @xmath20 for @xmath22 coincides with the local writhe at @xmath20 for @xmath25 .",
    "let us calculate the local writhe for @xmath22 .",
    "denote @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "the preimage of @xmath20 consists of points @xmath85 and @xmath86 corresponding to the values @xmath87 and @xmath84 of @xmath88 , respectively , see figure [ f3 ] .",
    "the tangent vectors to the curve at these points are @xmath89 and @xmath90 . the vector @xmath47 connecting @xmath54 and @xmath55 is @xmath91 . by definition ,",
    "the writhe is the value taken by the orientation of @xmath92 on the frame @xmath59 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "this value is equal to the value of this orientation on the frame @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 multiplied by the sign of @xmath96    let us calculate the local writhe for @xmath25 .",

    "the preimage of @xmath20 consists of points @xmath98 and @xmath99 corresponding to the values @xmath100 and @xmath101 of @xmath88 .",
    "choose the branch which passes through @xmath102 .",
    "it belongs to the upper half of the line @xmath28 , which induces the positive orientation of the real part directed along @xmath95 .",
    "at @xmath102 the branch of the curve has tangent vector @xmath103 and the real basis consisting of @xmath59 and @xmath104 positively oriented with respect to the complex orientation of this branch .",
    "the projection maps this basis to the positively oriented basis @xmath105 , @xmath106 of the projection of the branch .",
    "the intersection number of this projection and @xmath107 in @xmath108 is the sign of @xmath109 hence the orientation of @xmath107 such that its local intersection number with the selected branch of the projection does not coincide with the orientation defined by the standard basis .",
    "the intersection number of the line @xmath28 with the standard orientation and the @xmath17-plane with the standard orientation is the value of the orientation of the ambient space @xmath110 taken on the standard basis @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the local writhe is opposite to this value .",
    "[ rem ] there is a more conceptual proof of lemma [ lem3 ] . it is based on a local version of the rokhlin complex orientation formula , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the original proof was done in that way . however , the complex orientation formula is more complicated than the calculation above .      to speak about vassiliev invariants , we need to fix a connected family of curves , in which links under consideration comprise the complement to a hypersurface . in the case of classical knots",
    "one could include all knots in such a family by adjoining knots with self - intersections and other singularities .",
    "a singular knot is a right equivalence class of a smooth map of the circle to the space ( recall that two maps from a circle are right equivalent if one of them is a composition of a self - diffeomorphism of the circle with the other one ) .    in the case of real algebraic knots ,",
    "such a family including all real algebraic knots does not exist .",
    "even the space of complex curves in the three - dimensional projective space consists of infinitely many components .",
    "it is impossible to change the homology class realized by the set of complex points of an algebraic curve in @xmath40 by a continuous deformation .",
    "recall that the homology class belongs to the group @xmath111 and is a positive multiple @xmath112 $ ] of the natural generator of @xmath113\\in h_2(\\c p^3)$ ] realized by a line .",
    "the coefficient @xmath114 is called the _ order _ of the curve .",
    "the genus is another numerical characteristic of a complex curve which takes the same value for all nonsingular curves in any irreducible family .",
    "as is well known , the nonsingular complex curves of given order and genus in three - dimensional projective space are parametrized by a finite union of quasi - projective varieties . for each of these varieties , one can try to build a separate theory of vassiliev invariants on a class of nonsingular real algebraic curves whose complexifications are parametrized by points of this variety .",
    "( a similar phenomenon takes place in topology : links with different numbers of components can not be included into a reasonable connected family , and therefore for each number of components there is a separate theory of vassiliev invariants . )    among the varieties of algebraic curves in three - dimensional projective space , there are two special families : for each natural number @xmath114 there is an irreducible variety of rational curves of order @xmath114 ( recall that a an algebraic curve is called rational if it admits an algebraic parametrization by a line ) , and for each pair of natural numbers @xmath4 and @xmath32 there is an irreducible variety of curves which can be presented as intersection of surfaces of degrees @xmath4 and @xmath32 .    in the class of real algebraic rational curves of order @xmath114 , singular curves comprise a _ discriminant hypersurface _ in which a generic point is a rational curve such that it has exactly one singular point and this point is an ordinary double point .",
    "an ordinary double point may be of one of the following two types : either it is an intersection point of two real branches , or two imaginary conjugate branches .",
    "any two real algebraic rational nonsingular curves of order @xmath114 can be connected by a path in the space of real rational curves of degree @xmath114 that intersects the discriminant hypersurface only transversally at a finite number of generic points .",
    "such a path can be regarded as a deformation of a curve to the other one .",
    "when it intersects the discriminant hypersurface at a point , which is a curve with singularity on real branches , the set of real points of the curve behaves as in classical knot theory : two pieces of the set of real points come to each other and pass through each other . as in classical knot theory , at the moment of intersection , the generic projection of the curve experiences an isotopy .",
    "nothing happens besides that one crossing point becomes for a moment the image of a double point and then changes back into a crossing point , but with the opposite writhe .",
    "when the path intersects the discriminant hypersurface at a point , which is a curve with singularity on imaginary branches , two complex conjugate imaginary branches pass through each other .",
    "at the moment of passing , they intersect in a real isolated double point . at this moment",
    "the set of real points of a generic projection experiences an isotopy .",
    "no event happens besides that a solitary double point becomes for a moment the image of a solitary real double point of the curve and then changes back into an ordinary solitary double point of the projection ( which is not the image of a real point of the knot ) , but with the opposite writhe number .",
    "it is clear that the encomplexed writhe number of an algebraic curve changes under a modification of each of these kinds by @xmath115 , with the sign depending only on the local structure of the modification near the double point .",
    "this means that _ the encomplexed writhe number on the family of real rational curves under consideration is a vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2_.    this is true also for any space of nonsingular real algebraic curves that can be included into a connected family of real algebraic curves by adjoining a hypersurface , penetration through which at a generic point looks as in the family of rational curves described above .",
    "there are many families of this kind besides the families of rational knots .",
    "however , in many families of algebraic curves a transversal penetration through the discriminant hypersurface in a generic point looks differently . in particular , for intersections of two surfaces it is a morse modification of the real part of the curve . at the moment , the old double points of the projection , both solitary and crossing , do not change .",
    "an additional double point appears just for a moment .",
    "however the division of crossing points to self - crossing points of a single component and crossing points of different components may change .",
    "therefore the encomplexed writhe number changes in a complicated way .",
    "if the degrees of the surfaces defining the curve are of the same parity , the real part of the curve has a natural semi - orientation .",
    "the morse modification respects this semi - orientation .",
    "therefore the encomplexed writhe number of the semi - oriented curve does not change .",
    "[ vanishsl ] the encomplexed writhe number of any nonsingular semi - oriented real algebraic link which is a transversal intersection of two real algebraic surfaces whose degrees are of the same parity is zero .",
    "any two nonsingular real curves of the type under consideration can be connected by a path as above . hence their self - linking numbers coincide . on the other hand , it is easy to construct , for any pair of natural numbers @xmath4 and @xmath32 of the same parity , a pair of nonsingular real algebraic surfaces of degrees @xmath4 and @xmath32 transversal to each other in three - dimensional projective space such that their intersection has zero self - linking number .",
    "in contrast to this vanishing result , one can prove that the _ encomplexed writhe number of a real algebraic rational knots of degree @xmath114 can take any value in the interval between @xmath116 and @xmath117 including these limits and congruent to them modulo @xmath6_.",
    "the same construction may be applied to real algebraic curves in @xmath38 having singular imaginary points , but no real singularities . in the construction",
    "we can eliminate projections from the points such that some singular point is projected from them to a real point .",
    "indeed , for any imaginary point there exists only one real line passing through it ( the line connecting the point with its complex conjugate ) , thus we have to exclude a finite number of real lines .",
    "this gives a generalization of encomplexed writhe numbers with the same properties : it is invariant with respect to rigid isotopies ( i.e. , isotopies made of curves from this class ) , and is multiplied by @xmath1 under a mirror reflection .      the construction of this paper can be applied to algebraic links in the sphere @xmath3 .",
    "although from the viewpoint of knot theory this is the most classical case , from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry the case of curves in the projective space is simpler .",
    "the three - dimensional sphere @xmath3 is a real algebraic variety .",
    "it is a quadric in four - dimensional real affine space .",
    "the stereographic projection is a birational isomorphism of @xmath3 onto @xmath38 .",
    "it defines a diffeomorphism between the complement of the center of the projection in @xmath3 and a real affine space .",
    "given a real algebraic link in @xmath3 , one may choose a real point of @xmath3 from the complement of the link and project the link from this point to an affine space .",
    "then include the affine space into the projective space and apply the construction above .",
    "the image has no real singular points , therefore we can use the result of the previous section .",
    "this construction blows up the center of projection , making a real projective plane out of it , and maps the complement to the center of the projection in the set of real points of the sphere isomorphically onto the complement of the projective plane . in the imaginary domain",
    ", it contracts each generatrix of the cone which is the intersection of the sphere with its tangent plane at the center of projection .",
    "the image of the cone is an imaginary quadric curve contained in the projective plane which appeared as the result of blowing up of the central point .",
    "first , consider the most straightforward generalization .",
    "let @xmath57 be a nonsingular real algebraic @xmath118-dimensional subvariety in the projective space of dimension @xmath119 .",
    "its generic projection to @xmath120 has only ordinary double points . at each double point",
    "either both branches of the image are real or they are imaginary complex conjugate . if the set of real points is orientable , then one can repeat everything with obvious changes and obtain a definition of a numeric invariant generalizing the encomplexed writhe number defined above .",
    "let @xmath121 be a nonsingular three - dimensional real algebraic variety with oriented set of real points equipped with a real algebraic fibration over a real algebraic surface @xmath122 with fiber a projective line .",
    "there is a construction which assigns to a real algebraic link ( i.e. , a nonsingular real algebraic curve in @xmath121 ) with a generic projection to @xmath122 an integer , which is invariant under rigid isotopy , is multiplied by @xmath1 under the orientation reversal in @xmath121 and is a vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath2 .",
    "this construction is similar to the one presented above , but uses , instead of the projection to @xmath70 , an algebraic version of turaev s shadow descriptions of links @xcite .",
    "here we discuss only one example .",
