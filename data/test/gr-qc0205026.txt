    "davies @xcite there seems to be a paradox that the material contents of the universe began in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium , whereas the universe today is far from equilibrium . hence the thermodynamic entropy has been reduced in conflict with slt which says that the entropy of the universe is an increasing function of cosmic time .",
    "this is due to the tendency of self - gravitating systems irreversibly to grow inhomogeneous .    in order to include this gravitational effect into a generalized version of slt , one has to define a gravitational entropy .",
    "several tentative definitions have been given based on penrose s weyl curvature hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the weyl curvature tensor vanishes identically in the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe models .",
    "it was suggested by penrose @xcite to use this tensor as a measure of inhomogeneities of the universe models .",

    "the initial curvature singularity would then be one with large ricci tensor and vanishing weyl tensor ( zero entropy in the geometry ) ; the final curvature singularity would have weyl tensor much larger than ricci tensor ( large entropy in the geometry ) .    in order to quantify penrose s conjecture wainwright and collaborators",
    "@xcite have suggested that the quantity p^2= [ defp]may represent a `` gravitational entropy '' , at least in a cosmological context with a non - vanishing ricci - tensor .",
    "we could of course ask ourself whether the entropic behavior of the weyl curvature invariant ( or an invariant composed thereof ) results because the weyl tensor is _ directly related _ to the gravitational entropy , or whether it is only a side - effect because the universe evolves towards a state of maximal entropy . hence ,",
    "even though the results may show that the weyl curvature invariant has an entropic behaviour , it is by no means a proof that the weyl tensor should be identified as the `` gravitational entropy '' .",

    "all the models will now have a late time behaviour similar to the flat case .",
    "the frw models will become inflationary and will be dominated by this fluid at some stage in the future ( provided that the universe is ever - expanding ) . to simplify",
    ", we will therefore consider a flat universe , and perturb the frw flat universe model with @xmath128 .",
    "following @xcite , the anisotropic stresses will not dominate the shear modes at late times .",
    "the shear will under these assumptions decrease as _ t^- while the hubble parameter is the same as in the frw case ( to lowest order ) h = t^-1 .",
    "the late time behaviour of @xmath19 is now p^2=",
    "o(^2 t^- ) which is decreasing for all @xmath129 .",
    "the late time behaviour of @xmath88 is s = p = o(t ) which is increasing linearly in @xmath35 at late times .",
    "for @xmath14 we recover the cosmological constant case where @xmath88 is approximately a constant at late times .",
    "note also that this result coincide with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmsol ] ) for @xmath130 .",
    "hence , during the inflationary period , @xmath88 increases much slower than for ordinary matter ( @xmath131 for dust and @xmath132 for radiation ) .",
    "maybe the closest to a quantum theory of gravitation that have been obtained , is what we call quantum cosmology ( qc ) . we will in this section",
    "show how one might be able to determine the likelihood of a certain initial state to occur .",
    "qc is perhaps best described as a `` theory of initial conditions '' .",
    "we will again use the results of the previous paper to try determine which of the initial states are more probable .    in qc",
    ", the wave function of the universe satisfies the _ wheeler - dewitt ( wd ) equation _ : ( -g_ijkl+ v(h_ij))=0 where @xmath133 is called dewitt s supermetric , and @xmath134 is the metric on the 3-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "the potential term @xmath135 consists of the ricci scalar of the three - dimensional hypersurfaces and possibly matter potentials and a cosmological constant .",
    "we want now to calculate the expectation value for the weyl scalar , in these models .",
    "all of the curvature invariants have to go over to their respective curvature operators .",
    "especially , the entity @xmath88 goes over to the curvature operator @xmath136 .",
    "the question is now , what is more likely , creation of a universe with large expectation value of @xmath136 or a universe with a low value ?      in the paper @xcite we considered semi - classical tunneling wave functions which are solutions of the wd equation .",
    "the universe was tunneling from a matter - dominated universe classically confined to a finite size , into a de sitter like universe .",
    "after tunneling across the classically forbidden region the universe became @xmath1-dominated , similarly to an inflationary model of the universe .",
    "thus we have a `` flow '' from matter - dominated universes towards de sitter like universes .",
    "the actual expectation values of entities like @xmath137 , @xmath19 and @xmath88 are not explicitly obtained for these models , because the actual calculations suffer from `` endless '' expressions and highly time - consuming quantities . we will therefore give a more general description of the evolution of the weyl tensor for the lt models .",
    "it would be useful first to recapitulate some of the discussion done in @xcite .",
    "first of all we discussed tunneling wave functions in the wkb approximation . in the wkb approximation",
    "we assume that the wave function has the form @xmath138 , where @xmath88 will to the lowest order satisfy the hamilton - jacobi equation : @xmath139=0\\ ] ] here @xmath140 denotes the functional derivative with respect to the function @xmath29 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath141 , the resulting equation will be the hamilton - jacobi equation for a point particle with action @xmath142 ( @xmath26 is only a parameter and the functional derivatives turn into ordinary partial derivatives ) . in the hamilton - jacobi equation",
    "the functional @xmath143 turns out to be the action at the classical level .",
    "since the classical action can be written as an integral over @xmath26 the assumption @xmath141 is therefore reasonable at the lowest order wkb level .",
    "we can interpret the action @xmath144 as the action of a point particle moving in a potential @xmath145 $ ] with zero energy .",
    "the wkb wave function @xmath146 for the point particle can then be written @xmath147 .",
    "the two wkb wave functions can therefore be related by @xmath148 .",
    "finding first the wave function @xmath149 we can then relate its wkb approximation to @xmath150 through @xmath148 .",
    "let us now ask the question : _ is it more likely for a universe with small weyl tensor to tunnel through the classical barrier than a universe with a large weyl tensor ? _ the question is difficult to answer in general but we shall make some simple considerations in order to shed some light upon it .",
    "we assume that the dust density near the origin of the coordinates is larger than further out .",
    "we define the homogeneous mass function for a closed universe ( @xmath151 ) as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a constant .",
    "the constant @xmath153 is determined by demanding @xmath154 . if the dust density is larger near the origin of the @xmath26-coordinate than for larger values of @xmath26 then @xmath155",
    ". this will not in general change the size of the universe so we can look at the effects from @xmath28 alone .",
    "since @xmath28 is greater in general for an inhomogeneous universe than for a homogeneous universe , we see that the potential barrier will be smaller for an inhomogeneous universe than for a homogeneous universe .",
    "thus an inhomogeneous universe will tunnel more easily through the classical barrier than the homogeneous universe . since an inhomogeneous universe will have a larger weyl tensor than an almost homogeneous one",
    ", we see that universes with large weyl tensor tunnel more easily than those with a small weyl tensor .",
    "if we look at the tunneling amplitude concerning effects from the @xmath1 term , it is evident that larger @xmath1 will yield a larger tunneling probability . in the initial era inhomogeneities",
    "will increase the value of @xmath88 .",
    "we saw that an inhomogeneous state will tunnel more easily through the potential barrier than a homogeneous state .",
    "the largest tunneling probability amplitude thus occurs for universes with a large cosmological constant and large local inhomogeneities . from a classical point of view",
    "the value of @xmath88 initially was large ( but increasing thereafter ) , but as the universe entered the inflationary era the cosmological constant had a large value , hence the value of @xmath88 at the end of the inflationary era was relatively small .",
    "in the initial epoch the universe is not believed to be dust dominated .",
    "the dust does not exert any pressure and dust particles do therefore not interact with each other . a more probable matter content is matter which has internal pressure . even though gravitation tends to make the space inhomogeneous , internal pressure from the matter will try to homogenise the space . since dust is the only matter source in our model , the model only indicates the tendency for gravitation itself to create inhomogeneities .",
    "since the universes tunnel into a de sitter - like state , the cosmological constant will rapidly dominate the evolution .",
    "the larger the cosmological constant the lower will the entity @xmath88 be after the inflationary era ends .",
    "we can write the general solution of the wd - equation for the bianchi type i models as : @xmath156\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is a particular solution of the wd equation ( with dust ) , @xmath158 is a `` normalizing constant '' , and @xmath159 is a distribution function in momentum space .",
    "this distribution function satisfies the equation : @xmath160 the function @xmath161 is the _",
    "whittaker function_.    there is still a factoring problem in turning the classical entities to operators .",
    "let us first investigate the expectation value of @xmath137 . in the expression for the weyl tensor squared , there is a term ( p_+^2+p_-^2)^2 where @xmath162 is the conjugated momenta to @xmath6 .",
    "upon quantization , the above term is replaced with the operator : ( p_+^2+p_-^2)^2(+ ) ^2 in the expectation value of the square of the weyl tensor , the above term will contribute with @xmath163 ; @xmath164 , the contribution from this term to the weyl curvature invariant will diverge as @xmath17 for small @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that , in the small @xmath3 limit the expectation value of @xmath165 goes as : @xmath166 just as in the classical case .",
    "investigating the invariant @xmath167 , we notice that things are not so easy .",
    "the ricci square also has a term which presumably would contribute with a @xmath168 term .",
    "however , looking at the classical expression we see that the ricci square is independent of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that at the classical level all terms involving the anisotropy parameters , have to cancel exactly .",
    "this is not the case quantum mechanically . in the quantum case",
    "operators do not necessarily commute . hence there may be contributions from terms which classically would cancel each other . in other words ,",
    "the fact that the classical vacuum has @xmath104 , does not mean that the quantum vacuum has @xmath169 .",
    "we assume that @xmath170 is a set of factor - ordering parameters which represents the `` true '' quantum mechanical system in such a way that @xmath171 represents the classical system . with this parameterization of the factor ordering we would expect the ricci square expectation value to be : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is some function of @xmath3 which has the property : @xmath174 .",
    "thus for small @xmath3 and @xmath175 the expectation value would behave as @xmath176    and @xmath177 the weyl square divided by the ricci square is in general finite as @xmath178 for a quantum system . in some sense ,",
    "the quantum mechanical effects renormalizes the infinity that the classical system possesses at @xmath16 .",
    "the expectation value at @xmath16 is , however , strongly dependent on the factor - ordering .",
    "as the factor ordering parameters approach zero , the value will diverge .",
    "quantum effects in the early epoch are essential for the behaviour of this entity near the initial singularity .",
    "as @xmath178 we expect the quantum effect to be considerable , thus expecting the factor - ordering parameters @xmath175 to be large .    as indicated in the above discussion , the quantum mechanical expectation value of @xmath179 will be lower and presumably finite at the initial singularity .",
    "therefore the expectation value of @xmath180 is also presumed to be considerably lower in the initial stages than its classical counterpart .",
    "comparing different tunnelling amplitudes in the bianchi type i model is difficult and more speculative because the bianchi type i universe has no classically forbidden region for @xmath181 .",
    "this causes the lowest order wkb approximation to be purely oscillatory . the lowest order wkb wave function will therefore be approximately constant",
    ". in the paper",
    "@xcite we did however construct under some assumptions a wave function which clearly peaked at small values of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "thus these wave functions predicts universes that have a relatively low value of @xmath88 .",
    "let us now recapitulate how the evolution in the context of the wcc _ might _ have been .",
    "the universe was created in a rather arbitrary state . as the time ticked past the planck time @xmath182 s a rather inhomogeneous universe appeared .",
    "qc suggests that this state was rather inhomogeneous , but it is more or less a guess how inhomogeneous the universe was at that state .",
    "nevertheless , as the universe grew larger , the expectation value of the weyl entropy increased initially . at",
    "what rate the weyl entropy increased is highly uncertain , it depends very much on the true nature of our universe .",
    "it depends on what matter fields that were present , the topology of the universe , whether it was anisotropic or not , quantum effects etc .",
    "nevertheless , at some time very short after the big bang , an enormous effective cosmological constant appeared .",
    "the universe was driven unconditionally into an inflationary period .",
    "the weyl entropy stopped increasing and began instead to evolve asymptotically towards a constant .",
    "whether or not the weyl entropy had earlier a higher value than at the exit of the inflationary regime , is difficult to say . during the inflationary period ,",
    "the universe was more or less in an adiabatic expanding state , the weyl entropy was more or less constant .",
    "since the universe was expanding exponentially during this period , the entropy per unit volume dropped exponentially .",
    "if the scale factor increased by a factor of 60 @xmath183-foldings during the inflationary epoch , then the entropy per unit volume of space would have decreased by a factor of ~e^-36010 ^ -78 .",
    "this is quite a drastic decrease , and shows how powerful inflation is when it comes to smoothing out the inhomogeneities and anisotropies of our universe .    at the exit of the inflationary regime ,",
    "the weyl entropy had dropped by an enormous factor compared to what is would have been if no inflation had occurred .",
    "the weyl entropy was very small , compared to the maximal possible value .",
    "the universe was more or less uniform and homogeneous .",
    "this homogeneity can be seen in the cmb radiation today .",
    "however , small fluctuations in the spectrum can also be seen , reflecting the state of the universe 300 000 years after the big bang .",
    "after the inflation , small seeds of inhomogeneities from the quantum fluctuations of quantum fields were the only thing left of the initial inhomogeneities .",
    "nevertheless , these seeds were large enough to gradually clump together and form galaxies and stars .",
    "the weyl entropy began to increase again after the inflationary regime was over .",
    "the radiation- , and later the matter - dominated universe caused the weyl entropy to grow steadily and firmly for almost 15 billion years . during the radiation era , there were only small inhomogeneities and anisotropies left of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "using the calculations from the earlier section , the weyl entropy increases as @xmath132 in the radiation era .    at",
    "about @xmath18410 000 years the radiation become sub - dominant .",
    "the universe evolved into a matter dominated era and the weyl entropy increased as @xmath185 . today",
    "it is still growing .",
    "recent observations suggest that the universe has entered a new era with accelerated expansion .",
    "the surprising fact that the universe appears to be in an accelerating state today , can be explained with the presence of a vacuum energy .",
    "if this is true , the weyl entropy will increase steadily and asymptotically towards a constant .",
    "however , the late time behaviour of our universe is still quite speculative , and whether or not this vacuum dominated period will persist , is very uncertain .",
    "it might happen that the period ends like inflation did , and perhaps the vacuum period is followed by a curvature dominated period .",
    "if so , the weyl entropy might again rise to new heights , increasing towards a value where all the matter is collected in black holes .",
