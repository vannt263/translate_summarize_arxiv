    "they seem not related directly to topology ( like zero modes are , due to index theorems ) , but it has been observed that they are sensitive to the location of instantons @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties of their localization have been investigated recently  @xcite .    here",
    "we will present two ideas concerning laplacian modes @xcite .",
    "the first one is to study what can be learned from the profile of the modulus of the lowest mode ( the ` ground state probability density ' ) @xmath3 , in particular with changing boundary conditions .",
    "the second idea is to introduce a novel low - pass filter .",
    "it concerns the reconstruction of the gauge background from relatively few laplacian modes .",
    "the purpose of both methods is to identify the underlying infrared degrees of freedom in the gauge field that are responsible for features like confinement .",

    "[ fig_cal_scal_mode ] ( top ) shows the action density along the line connecting these monopoles , which are clearly visible as two selfdual ( and almost perfectly static ) lumps . as another signal the polyakov loop goes through @xmath5 and @xmath6  which amounts to a local symmetry restoration  at the monopole cores .",
    "the lowest - lying mode of the laplacian in this background is shown in fig.[fig_cal_scal_mode ] ( bottom ) @xcite .",
    "one can see that the presence of monopoles is reflected by a maximum resp .",
    "a minimum in the profile of the lowest mode ( although slightly shifted ) .",
    "in addition , we have depicted the lowest - lying laplacian mode with antiperiodic boundary conditions in euclidean time . in that mode",
    "the role of the monopoles is interchanged , which can be understood from a symmetry of the caloron .",
    "hence the lowest - lying laplacian mode ` hops ' as the result of changing the boundary conditions .",

    "analyzing 50 independent configurations we found that the lowest mode hops up to four times as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "apart from the laplacian mode being wave - like , the hopping phenomenon resembles the behavior of the fermion zero mode in thermalized configurations @xcite .",
    "however , in both cases it is not obvious which gluonic feature , e.g.  in the topological charge , distinguishes the preferred locations .",
    "interestingly , we have found a correlation of the maximum of the periodic and antiperiodic laplacian mode to positive and negative polyakov loops , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig_mode_vs_polloop ] .",
    "this is the same tendency as for calorons ( cf .",
    "[ fig_cal_scal_mode ] ) which could be understood as an argument in favor of calorons ` underlying ' the quantum configurations .",

    "laplacian ( ` harmonic ' ) eigenmodes can be used to define a new fourier - like filter which we present now @xcite .",
    "we were inspired by the representation of the field strength in terms of fermionic modes in @xcite , but here we aim to reconstruct directly the link variables on which any observable can be measured . to this end",
    "we combine the definition of the lattice laplacian , eq .",

    ", the filtered links @xmath28 can be shown to be pure gauge . from the behavior of @xmath29 under gauge transformations it follows immediately that @xmath28 transforms as a link ( and no gauge fixing",
    "is involved in the filter ) .",
    "the filtering can be performed with laplacian modes of any boundary condition .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eqn_3 ] ) is just the average over opposite boundary conditions @xmath8 and @xmath30 .",
    "this additional parameter @xmath8 completely fixes the polyakov loop at @xmath31 to @xmath32 , while for nontrivial cases @xmath33 the polyakov loop is observed to fluctuate around this value .",
    "it follows that in order to optimize the filter for our circumstances ( confined phase , nontrivial holonomy calorons ) the best choice is the intermediate case @xmath10 .    in order to test the filter",
    ", we again start with a caloron ( this time over @xmath16 ) . the action and topological density as well as the polyakov loop plotted in fig .",

    "we have recorded the determinant used in eq.([eqn_3 ] ) to project to an @xmath2-element . with increasing number @xmath23 of modes",
    "it increases , too ( i.e.  becomes closer to 1 ) .",
    "moreover , its variation over the lattice decreases , such that all links appear ` equally well filtered ' . +    , filtered with boundary condition @xmath10 . from top to bottom : @xmath34 modes ( densities multiplied by a factor of 100 ) , @xmath35 modes ( factor 400 ) and the original configuration ( factor 400).,title=\"fig : \" ] , filtered with boundary condition @xmath10 . from top to bottom : @xmath34 modes ( densities multiplied by a factor of 100 ) , @xmath35 modes ( factor 400 ) and the original configuration ( factor 400).,title=\"fig : \" ] , filtered with boundary condition @xmath10 . from top to bottom : @xmath34 modes ( densities multiplied by a factor of 100 ) , @xmath35 modes ( factor 400 ) and the original configuration ( factor 400).,title=\"fig : \" ]    now we turn to the application of the filter to thermalized configurations ( at finite temperature ) , first by the example of sect .  [ sect_2.2 ] .",
    "the first question we want to address is the correlation of the filtered links to the original ones .",
    "[ fig_corr_links ] shows scatterplots including all @xmath2-components of the links in all @xmath36-directions and over all lattice locations . to compare link variables themselves",
    "makes sense , since the original and the filtered configuration come in the same gauge ( in other words the application of the filter commutes with gauge transformations ) .",
    "[ fig_corr_links ] ( left ) shows that even in the first nontrivial case @xmath37 the filtered links are correlated to the original ones . with increasing number of involved modes",
    "this correlation becomes stronger as expected : in the scatterplot for @xmath38 ( fig .  [ fig_corr_links ] ( middle ) ) the deviation from the diagonal decreased compared to @xmath37 .",
    "one can make this statement quantitative by computing the average square distance from the diagonal , which indeed is smaller for bigger @xmath23 .",
    "actually , it also shows that the time - like links are less correlated than the space - like ones , especially when using the ` inappropriate ' periodic boundary conditions . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig_corr_links ] ( right ) shows that the filter with comparable number of modes produces strongly correlated links .",
    "+ what is even more remarkable is that the filter method preserves the string tension .",
    "we plot the logarithm of the polyakov loop correlator measured on 50 configurations at @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig_stringtensions ] ( left ) , both for the original one and the filtered ones with @xmath40 .",
    "it reveals a clearly linear behavior with a slope reproducing the original one within 15% .",
    "the minimal number of modes , @xmath37 , suffices for this behavior .",
    "we conclude that the confining properties of lattice gauge theory are captured by the lowest laplacian modes .",
    "this property actually does not depend much on the ordinal number of the modes , see fig .",
    "[ fig_stringtensions ] ( right ) .",
    "first of all , one can include the @xmath23 highest laplacian modes . due to the symmetry @xcite @xmath41 including these highest modes results in the same bilinear contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_3 ] ) with the only modification @xmath42 .",
    "the polyakov loop correlator computed from the 50 configurations filtered in this way agrees very well with the one discussed so far ( and is therefore not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_stringtensions ] ) .",
    "the second possibility is to shift the mode number from 1 till 4 to say 5 till 8 or 51 till 54 .",
    "the corresponding curves shown in fig .  [ fig_stringtensions ] ( right ) reveal the same linear behavior up to a vertical shift .",
    "the polyakov loop correlator is robust also against a third option , namely replacing the eigenvalues @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_3 ] ) by a constant , which again produces identical curves ( not shown ) .",
    "after filtering the polyakov loop correlator has no sign of a coulomb regime , since the filter has washed out short range fluctuations . at zero distance the values @xmath44 are smaller than the original one .",
    "this reflects the already mentioned effect that the filtered links for small @xmath23 are mostly traceless ( governed by the choice @xmath10 ) .",
    "the site distribution of the polyakov loop is a narrow one around @xmath45 for @xmath37 , but for @xmath38 is compatible with the original distribution which in turn is described by the haar measure . fig .",
    "[ fig_polloops_filtered ] shows locally ( for the example configuration and in a fixed lattice plane ) that with growing @xmath23 more and more fluctuations appear in the polyakov loop .",
    "studies are under way to clarify whether the new filter method preserves other infrared features , like the spatial wilson loops , and how it behaves at zero temperature .",
    "+ since the filter preserves the string tension from polyakov loop correlators and is not biased to classical solutions nor to particular degrees of freedom in the gauge field ( like monopoles or vortices ) , it is interesting to have a closer look at the vacuum structures that emerge when the filter is applied to generic configurations .    concerning the action density , these objects are found to be isolated peaks ( which are non - static and not necessarily ( anti)selfdual ) .",
    "this phenomenon seems counterintuitive as the filter uses the lowest - lying laplacian modes which are smooth .",
    "however , too small action density lumps have also been observed when filtering smooth calorons at low @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "[ fig_cal_filtered ] ( top ) ) .",
    "this phenomenon presumably comes from the nonlinearity in the filter formalism ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn_3 ] ) ) , in particular the determinant used to scale up the mode contributions to an @xmath2-element .",
    "interestingly , we have found a correlation of the peak structure of the filtered action density to that emerging after cooling or smearing in an early stage .",
    "we stress that , in contrast to e.g.  cooling , the filter does not involve the plaquette action and thus is not made to reduce it in the first place . upon filtering the links",
    ", the total action does become smaller , but only down to some amount ( in our example down to 66 instanton units at @xmath37 ) , which might well be the minimal content necessary to reproduce the infrared physics .",
