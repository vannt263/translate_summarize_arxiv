    "( ii ) _ the characteristic time of non - radiative losses caused by adiabatic expansion of the source or particle escape and _ ( iii ) _ the cooling time of competing radiation mechanisms that result in low - energy photons _ outside _ the @xmath0-ray domain .",
    "as long as the charged particles are effectively confined in the @xmath0-ray production region , at some circumstances these condition could be fulfilled even in environments with a relatively low gas and photon densities or weak magnetic field .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0-ray production efficiency could be close to 1 even when @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the characteristic linear size of the production region , @xmath3 is the speed of light ) . in such cases the secondary @xmath0-rays",
    "escape the source without significant internal absorption .",
    "each of the above mentioned @xmath0-ray _ production _ mechanisms has its major `` counterpart '' - @xmath0-ray _ absorption _ mechanism of same electromagnetic origin resulting in electron - positron pair production in matter ( the counterpart of bremsstrahlung ) , in photon gas ( the counterpart of inverse compton scattering ) , and in magnetic field ( the counterpart of synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray production mechanisms and their absorption counterparts have similar cross - sections , therefore the condition for radiation @xmath4 generally implies small optical depth for the corresponding @xmath0-ray absorption mechanism , @xmath5 .",
    "but in many astrophysical scenarios , in particular in compact galactic and extragalactic objects with favorable conditions for particle acceleration , the radiation processes proceed so fast that @xmath4 . at these conditions",
    "the internal @xmath0-ray absorption becomes unavoidable .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray production and absorption processes occur in relativistic regime , namely when ( i ) @xmath6 in the hydrogen gas , ( ii ) @xmath7 in photon gas ( often called klein - nishina regime ; @xmath8 is the average energy of the target photons ) , or ( iii ) @xmath9 in the magnetic field ( often called quantum regime ; @xmath10 is the so - called critical strength of the magnetic field ) , the problem can not be reduced to a simple absorption effect . in this regime , the secondary electrons produce new generation of high energy @xmath0-rays , these photons again produce electron - positron pairs , so the electromagnetic cascade develops .",
    "the characteristics of electromagnetic cascades in matter have been comprehensively studied , basically in the context of interactions of cosmic rays with the earth s atmosphere ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well as for calculations of performance of detectors of high energy particles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of electromagnetic cascades in matter can be applied to some sources of high energy cosmic radiation , in particular to the `` hidden source '' scenarios like massive black holes in centers of agn or young pulsars inside the dense shells of recent supernovae explosions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . within another , so - called `` beam dump '' models ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) applied to x - ray binaries , protons accelerated by the compact object ( a neutron star or black hole ) , hit the atmosphere of the normal companion star , and thus result in production of high energy neutrinos and @xmath0-rays @xcite . in such objects ,",
    "the thickness of the surrounding gas can significantly exceed @xmath11 , thus the protons produced in the central source would initiate ( through production of high energy @xmath0-rays and electrons ) electromagnetic showers . these sources perhaps represent the `` best hope '' of neutrino astronomy , but they are generally considered as less attractive targets for gamma - ray astronomy . however , the @xmath0-ray emission in these objects is not fully suppressed .",
    "the recycled radiation with spectral features determined by the thickness ( `` grammage '' ) of the gas shell , should be seen in @xmath0-rays in any case , unless the synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons dominates over the bremsstrahlung losses and channels the main fraction of the nonthermal energy into the sub gamma - ray domains .",
    "the development of electromagnetic cascades in photon gas and magnetic fields is a more common phenomenon in astrophysics . in photon fields",
    "such cascades can be created on almost _ all _ astronomical scales , from compact objects like accreting black holes @xcite , fireballs in gamma - ray bursts @xcite and sub - pc jets of blazars @xcite to large - scale ( up to @xmath12 kpc ) agn jets @xcite and @xmath13 mpc size clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic cascades in the intergalactic medium lead to formation of huge ( @xmath14 mpc ) nonthermal structures like hypothetical electron - positron pair halos @xcite . finally , there is little doubt that the entire universe is a scene of continuous creation and development of electromagnetic cascades .",
    "all of energy @xmath15 a few gev emitted by astrophysical objects have a similar fate .",
    "sooner or later they terminate on hubble scales due to interactions with the diffuse extragalactic background .",
    "since the energy density of 2.7 k cmbr significantly exceeds the energy density of intergalactic magnetic fields , these interactions initiate electron - photon cascades @xcite .",
    "the superposition of contributions of from these cascades should constitute a significant fraction of the observed diffuse extragalactic background .",
    "bonometto and rees @xcite perhaps where the first who realized the astrophysical importance of development of electron - photon cascades supported by @xmath0-@xmath0 pair - production and inverse compton scattering in dense photon fields . when the so called compactness parameter @xcite @xmath16 ( l is the luminosity and r is the radius of the source ) is less than 10 , then the cascade is developed in the linear regime , i.e. when the soft radiation produced by cascade electrons do not have a significant feedback effect on the cascade development . in many cases ,",
    "including the cascade development in compact objects , this approximation works quite well .",
    "the first quantitative study of characteristic of linear cascades in photon fields has been performed using the method of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "generally , the kinetic equations for the cascade particles can be solved only numerically . however , with some simplifications it is possible to derive useful analytical approximations @xcite which help to understand the features of the steady - state solutions for cascades in photon fields .    the cascade development in the magnetic field is a key element to understand the physics of pulsar magnetospheres @xcite , therefore it is generally treated as a process associated with very strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , such cascades could be triggered in many other ( at first glance unusual ) sites like the earth s geomagnetic field @xcite , accretion disks of massive black holes @xcite , etc . in general , the pair cascades in magnetic fields are effective when the product of the particle ( photon or electron ) energy and the strength of the field becomes close to the `` quantum threshold '' of about @xmath17 , unless we assume a specific , regular field configuration .",
    "an approximate approach , similar to the so - called approximation a of cascade development in matter @xcite , has been recently applied by akhiezer et al . @xcite .",
    "although this theory quite satisfactorily describes the basic features of photon - electron showers , it does not provide an adequate accuracy for quantitative description of the cascade characteristics @xcite . note that in both studies approximate",
    "cross - sections for magnetic bremsstrahlung and magnetic pair - production have been used , thus reducing the validity of the results to the limit @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the minimum energy of secondary particles being under consideration ) .",
    "as long as we are interested in the one - dimensional cascade development ( which seems to be quite sufficient for many astrophysical purposes ) , all 3 types of cascades can be described by the same integro - differential equations like the ones derived by landau and rumer @xcite , but in each case specifying the cross - sections of relevant interaction processes .",
    "the solution of these equations in a broad range of energies is however not a trivial task . in this paper",
    "we present the results of our recent study of cascade characteristics in 3 substances - matter , photon gas and magnetic field - with emphasis on the analysis of similarities and differences between these 3 types of cascades .",
    "for quantitative studies of these characteristics we have chosen the so - called technique of adjoint cascade equations .",
    "although this work has been initially motivated by methodological and pedagogical objectives , some results are rather original and may present practical interest in certain areas of high energy astrophysics .",
    "the results of this study are based on numerical solutions of the so - called adjoint cascade equations .",
    "the potential of this computational technique , in particular its possible applications to different problems of cosmic ray physics has been comprehensively described in ref.@xcite .",
    "below we briefly discuss the main features of solution of the adjoint cascade equations . for our purposes",
    "it is quite sufficient to consider only the longitudinal development of electromagnetic cascades neglecting the emission angles of secondary particles and , thus , assuming that all cascade particles are moved along the shower axis . besides , we neglect the differences in interactions of electrons and positrons , i.e. do not consider positron annihilation , both in flight and after thermalization in the ambient plasma",
    "this is a quite good approximation as long as we are interested in @xmath0-ray energies exceeding @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the fine structure constant ) . under these assumptions ,",

    "the approach of solution of adjoint cascade equations described above provides an accuracy better than a few per cent and gives results for an arbitrary region ( @xmath116 ) of the primary energy in _ just _ one run of calculations .",
    "also we notice that the computational time consumed by this method does not exceed on average a few minutes for a 1 ghz pc type computer and increases only weakly ( logarithmically ) with the primary energy . in summary ,",
    "the important feature of this technique is its flexibility to describe the cascade processes in 3 different substances .",
    "it allows large number of calculations with a good accuracy throughout very large energy intervals of both primary and secondary energies .",
    "this is an important condition for the quantitative analysis and for clear understanding of similarities and differences in cascade development in environments dominated by matter , photon gas or magnetic field .",
    "the above described technique requires specification of elementary processes that initiate and support the cascade development .",
    "if we are interested in the longitudinal development of cascades , the input should consist of total cross - sections of interactions and the differential cross - sections as functions of energy but integrated over the emission angles of secondary particles .",
    "in many astrophysical situations , especially at very high energies , this is a fair approximation , given the very small ( of order @xmath117 ) emission angles of secondary products .",
    "the one - dimensional treatment of the cascade development perfectly works , if electrons move along the lines of the regular magnetic field .",
    "otherwise , the deviation of particles from the cascade core is determined by reflection of secondary electrons by magnetic inhomogeneities rather than the emission angles . in these cases",
    "the diffusion effects must be appropriately incorporated into the cascade equations .",
    "this question is beyond the present paper .",
    "all processes involved in the electromagnetic cascades are well known .",
    "the cross - sections of these processes have been calculated and comprehensively studied with very high precision within the quantum electrodynamics .",
    "in the case of cascades in matter we take into account the ionization losses and bremsstrahlung for electrons ( positrons ) , and the pair production , compton scattering and photoelectric absorption for photons . at extremely high energies the so - called landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect that results in suppression of the bremsstrahlung and pair - production cross - sections , may have significant impact on the cascade development .",
    "the energy region where the lpm effect becomes noticeable , depends on the atomic number of the ambient matter . in the hydrogen dominated medium",
    "this energy region appears well beyond @xmath118  ev , therefore in many astrophysical scenarios the lpm effect can be safely ignored .",
    "two pairs of coupled processes  the inverse compton scattering and @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production in the photon gas and the magnetic bremsstrahlung ( synchrotron radiation ) and magnetic pair production in the magnetic field  determine the basic features of cascade produced in radiation and magnetic fields . at extremely high energies the higher order qed processes may compete with these basic channels .",
    "namely , when the product of energies of colliding cascade particles ( electrons or photons ) @xmath19 and the background photons @xmath8 significantly exceed @xmath119 , the processes @xmath120@xcite and @xmath121 @xcite dominate over the single ( @xmath122 ) pair production and the compton scattering , respectively .",
    "for example , in the 2.7 k cmbr the first process stops the linear increase of the mean free path of highest energy @xmath0-rays around @xmath123 , and puts a robust limit on the mean free path of @xmath0-rays of about 100 mpc .",
    "analogously , above @xmath124 the second process becomes more important than the conventional inverse compton scattering .",
    "because @xmath125 and @xmath126 channels result in production of 2 additional electrons , they significantly change the character of the pure klein - nishina pair cascades .",
    "however , an effective realization of these processes is possible only at very specific conditions with an extremely low magnetic field and narrow energy distribution of the background photons .",
    "because this study has methodological objectives , below we do not include these processes in calculations of cascade characteristics .",
    "this allows us to avoid unnecessary complications and make the analysis more transparent .",
    "for the same reason we do not include in this study the effect of the photon splitting @xcite which becomes quite important in pulsars with magnetic field close to @xmath127 ( see e.g. ref .",

    "the same parameter approximately corresponds to the mean free path of @xmath0-rays .",

    "usually the radiation length is expressed in units @xmath140 .",

    "_ parameter combination  2 _ ) primary penetrates very deep into the source without interacting with the ambient photon gas .",
    "consequently , the cascade starts very late and remains as underdeveloped .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field makes the cascade development much more effective , which now is supported by magnetic pair production and synchrotron radiation .",
    "the cascade develops in this regime until the energy of @xmath0-rays is reduced down to the effective threshold of the magnetic pair production , @xmath156 .",
