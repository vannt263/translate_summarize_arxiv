    "graphene appears to be the only known mono - atomic two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal and apart from the intrinsic interest it engenders , it is becoming more and more also a focus of possible and desired advanced technological applications  @xcite .",
    "it is for these reasons that in the past several years we have witnessed a veritable explosion of theoretical and experimental interest in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the nobel prize for physics in 2010 only consolidated this trend .",
    "graphene differs fundamentally from other known 2d semiconductors because of its unique electronic band structure , viz .",
    "the monoatomic sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice leads to an electron band structure that displays quite unusual properties  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface is reduced to just two points in the brillouin zone and the value of the band gap is reduced to zero . the energy dispersion relation for both the conduction and the valence bands are linear at low energy , namely less than 1 ev , meaning that the charge carriers behave as relativistic particles with zero rest mass .",
    "the agent responsible for many of the interesting electronic properties of graphene sheets is the non - bravais honeycomb - lattice arrangement of carbon atoms , which leads to a gapless semiconductor with valence and conduction @xmath0-bands .",
    "states near the fermi energy of a graphene sheet are described by a massless dirac equation which has chiral band states in which the honeycomb - sublattice pseudospin is aligned either parallel or opposite to the envelope function momentum .",
    "the dirac - like wave equation leads to both unusual electron - electron interaction effects and to unusual response to external potentials . when the graphene sheet is chemically doped with either acceptor or donor impurities its carrier mobility",
    "can be drastically decreased  @xcite . because of its 2d periodic structure graphene is closely related to single wall carbon nanotubes , being in fact a carbon nanotube rolled out into a single 2d sheet  @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the electronic properties of single wall carbon nanotubes and graphene is that the former show circumferential periodicity and curvature that leave their imprint also in the electronic spectrum and consequently also van der waals ( vdw ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , graphite appears to be the poor cousin of graphene though it is the stable form of carbon at ordinary temperatures and pressures .",
    "many efforts have been invested into understanding its structural and electronic details ( for an account see ref .",
    "various known modifications of graphite differ primarily in the way the mono - atomic two - dimensional graphene layers stack .",
    "their stacking sequence in terms of commonality is aba for the bernal structure , aaa for simple hexagonal graphite or abc for the rhombohedral graphite  @xcite .",
    "graphene layers in graphitic systems are basically closed shell systems and thus have no covalent bonding between layers which makes them almost a perfect candidate to study long(er ) ranged non - bonding interactions .",
    "indeed , they are stacked at an equilibrium interlayer spacing of about 0.335 nm and are held together primarily by the non - bonding long range vdw interactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore the interaction between graphene layers can be described as a balance between attractive vdw dispersion forces and corrugated repulsive ( pauli ) overlap forces @xcite , following in this respect closely the paradigm of nano - scale interactions  @xcite .    besides",
    "a few notable exceptions  @xcite , until 2009 many electronic and optical properties of graphene could be explained within a single - particle picture in which electron - electron interactions are completely neglected .",
    "the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect in graphene  @xcite represents an important hallmark in this context . by now",
    "there is a large body of experimental work  @xcite showing the relevance of electron - electron interactions in a number of key properties of graphene samples of sufficiently high quality .",
    "because of band chirality , the role of electron - electron interactions in graphene sheets differs in some essential ways  @xcite from the role which it plays in an ordinary 2d electron gas .",
    "one important difference is that the contribution of exchange and correlation to the chemical potential is an increasing rather than a decreasing function of carrier density .",
    "this property implies that exchange and correlation increases the effectiveness of screening , in contrast to the usual case in which exchange and correlation weakens screening  @xcite .",
    "this unusual property follows from the difference in sublattice pseudospin chirality between the dirac model s negative energy valence band states and its conduction band states  @xcite , and in a uniform graphene system is readily accounted for by many - body perturbation theory .    .",
    "the thickness of both ( left and right ) layers are equal to @xmath1 . in view of later generalizations ,",
    "we have labeled the left semi - infinite vacuum layer with @xmath2 , the graphene layers with @xmath3 , the intervening vacuum layer with @xmath4 and the right vacuum layer with @xmath5 .",
    "the form of the dielectric functions of the graphene layers is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dielectric - function - graphene - sheet]).,width=188 ]    in this work we focus our efforts on the vdw dispersion component of the graphene stacking interaction .",
    "dispersion forces can be formulated on various levels  @xcite giving mostly consistent results for their strength and separation dependence . in the context of graphene stacking interactions , the problem can be decomposed into the calculation of the dielectric response of the carbon sheets and the subsequent calculation of the vdw interactions either via the quantum - field - theory - based lifshitz approach , as advocated in this paper , by means of the electron correlation energy  @xcite or the non - local vdw density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "one can show straightforwardly that in fact the non - local van der waals functional approach of the density functional theory and the lifshitz formalism are in general equivalent  @xcite .",
    "specifically we will calculate the vdw - casimir interaction free energy , per unit area between two graphene sheets as a function of the seperation between them , in a system composed of    * two apposed undoped or doped graphene sheets , * an undoped or a doped graphene layer over a semi - infinite substrate , and * a multilayer ( infinite ) array of graphene sheets .",
    "in the latter case we will investigate the many - body non - pairwise additive effects in the effective interaction between two sheets within a multilayer array .",
    "we should note that non - pairwise additive effects are ubiquitous in the context of vdw interactions  @xcite often leading to non - trivial properties of macromolecular interactions . in this case",
    "they will lead to variations in the equilibrium stacking separation as a function of the number of layers in a graphitic configuration . in the calculation of the vdw - casimir free energy we will employ the dielectric response function of a single graphene layer calculated previously  @xcite .",
