    "however , it is hard to determine their structures by ordinary techniques used for the bulk materials , for example , traditional rietveld analysis . in the case of the nanoparticles ,",
    "the well - defined bragg peaks are not observed and the diffraction data mainly consist of the diffuse scattering , because the periodicity of their unit cells is limited to nanoscale .    the technique of the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) can be applicable to the determination of the local structure of the nanoparticles . for the system composed of one kind of atom ,",

    "even if @xmath8 does not have any well - difined peak as mentioned above , @xmath4 can have sharp peaks , at least , in the small @xmath1-region .",
    "then the pdf analysis is applicable to the structural analysis of the materials whose structures have short range correlation .",
    "recently , the technique of pdf has been applied for the determination of the structure of nanoparticles ( gilbert _ et al .",

    "furthermore , the intensity of the pdf must be reduced from that of the bulk sample with infinite size , due to the finite size even at @xmath1 smaller than the particle size .",

    "the corrections of the averaged size are crucial to discuss the local lattice disorder in the nanoparticle .    in this paper , we calculate the rdfs of the various nanoparticles by assuming that they are continua , for the corrections of the averaged size and the shape effect , and the correction factor to the rdfs and reduced pdfs for the various nanoparticles are obtained . by using the correction factor , the corrected formulation of the pdf analysis on nanoparticles are presented .",
    "based on our calculations , the method to estimate the sizes of the parts with ordered and disordered lattice in the particle , is also proposed .",

    "the pair distribution between the particles must be considered .",
