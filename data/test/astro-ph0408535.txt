    "reipurth et al . ( 2002 ) discovered that haro 1 - 14c , a weak - lined pre@xmath4main - sequence star in the ophiuchus star forming region ( hbc 644 , herbig & bell 1988 ) , is actually the primary component of a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb1 ) with a period of 591 days .",
    "we have been using high resolution infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy to detect the low - mass secondaries in main - sequence sb1s ( mazeh et al .",
    "2003 ) and pms sb1s ( prato et al . 2002a ) .",
    "we included haro 1 - 14c in our program for two reasons .",
    "first , detection of its secondary would contribute to our study of the mass ratio distribution among pms spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. , prato et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "second , it is important to test theoretical models of pms evolution with stars whose masses have been measured independently ( e.g. ,  simon et al . 2000 ; hillenbrand & white 2004 ) .",
    "meaningful tests require masses known to a few percent ; this is possible with masses measured dynamically .",
    "the fairly long period of haro 1 - 14c and its location in the ophiuchus sfr at @xmath5 pc distance suggested that the orbit might be resolvable with the current generation interferometers operating in the near ir .",
    "mapping observations of haro 1 - 14c , combined with the parameters derivable from analysis of the binary as a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) , could yield precision measurements of the primary and secondary masses and the distance to the system ( e.g. , boden et al .",
    "we have detected the secondary in haro 1 - 14c in 6 observations distributed over its orbital period .",
    "this paper describes our results .",
    "we measured the radial velocities of the haro 1 - 14c primary and secondary at the keck ii telescope of the keck observatory using the nirspec high - resolution ir spectrometer ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "we centered the spectrometer at 1.55 @xmath6 m and obtained data following the procedures we have described previously ( prato et al .",
    "2002a ,  2002b ) .",
    "all the observations were made without the adaptive optics system and have average spectral resolution r @xmath7 28,000 .",
    "the total integration times ranged from 6@xmath420 minutes , depending on seeing conditions , which provided spectra with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the ut dates and modified julian dates ( mjd ) of the observations are listed in table 1 , columns 1 and 2 .",
    "we used the redspec software to extract the spectra and place them on a wavelength scale .",
    "as in our previous work , we used only order 49 because it is almost completely free of terrestrial absorption lines .    to measure the radial velocities of the primary and secondary",
    ", we used the todcor two - dimensional algorithm ( zucker & mazeh 1994 ) and our suite of spectral templates as we have described before ( mazeh et al .",
    "2003 , prato et al .",
    "2002a ) . of the templates",
    "available , the main sequence star hr 8085 , rotationally broadened to 12 km s@xmath9 , usually provided the best fit to the primary of haro 1 - 14c .",
    "its k5 spectral type template is in reasonable agreement with the spectral type k3 listed in the herbig and bell catalogue ( herbig & bell 1988 ) for the component of haro 1 - 14c brighter in visible light .",
    "the m1.5 main sequence star gl 15a , also rotationally broadened to 12 km s@xmath9 , fit the secondary the best .",
    "the average secondary / primary flux ratio at 1.55 @xmath6 m was @xmath10 .",
    "however , because the main - sequence templates are not likely to match the surface gravity and metallicity of the pms components of haro 1 - 14c exactly , we do not regard as definitive the best - fitting spectral types and flux ratio .",
    "table 1 lists our measured radial velocities of the primary and secondary , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and their estimated uncertainties .",
    "reipurth et al.s ( 2002 ) observations of haro 1 - 14c provided 56 measurements of its primary velocity and spanned @xmath13 orbital periods .",
    "these yielded accurate values of the binary center - of - mass velocity , @xmath14 , orbital period , p , velocity semi - amplitude of the primary @xmath15 , eccentricity , e , primary semi - major axis multiplied by the sine of the inclination , @xmath16 , mass function , @xmath17 , time of periastron passage , @xmath18 , and longitude of the periastron of the primary , @xmath19 . to these parameters ,",
    "our measurements of the system contribute uniquely the velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary , @xmath20 , and hence the mass ratio , @xmath21 , and secondary semi - major axis , @xmath22 .",
    "we merged our measurements with reipurth et al s and , by least squares minimization of a phase shift of the sb2 data , first improved the precision of the p and @xmath18 values enabled by the longer time span of the combined data .",
    "we then derived the other orbital parameters by least squares minimization ; table 2 lists the values and figure 1 shows the corresponding double - lined orbital solution . the parameters in common with those calculated by reipurth et al .",
    "are very close to their values , as expected , because the data set is dominated by their 56 measurements of the primary velocity .",
    "the improvement in precision is greatest for @xmath23 and @xmath18 because of the longer time interval of the merged data .",
    "we used the new values of @xmath23 and @xmath18 to calculate the phases of the sb2 observations listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "the k3 spectral type of the primary ( reipurth et al . 2002 ) and pms evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , baraffe et al . 1998 ) for a few million year - old star suggest that @xmath24 @xmath1 .",
    "this value , with the measured mass ratio , indicate that @xmath25 . from table 1",
    "we have the estimate @xmath26 gm @xmath3 au . at the 140 pc assumed distance to the ophiuchus sfr",
    ", the apparent angular size of the projected semi - major axis would be @xmath27 mas .",
    "spectroscopic observations of sb2s leave three parameters undetermined : the two describing the binary orientation with respect to our line of sight , the orbital inclination , @xmath28 , and the position angle of the line of nodes , and the distance to the binary .",
    "these parameters can be determined by resolving the components of the sb2 and mapping the orbit ( e.g. , boden et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the requirements for a binary to be resolvable with the current generation of ir interferometers are very stringent .",
    "the apparent angular extent of the binary orbit must be small enough that it lies within the diffraction limit of a single telescope of the interferometer , but large enough that it is resolvable at the projected interferometer baselines .",
    "both components of the binary must be bright enough in the near - ir , usually k - band , that fringes can be detected , and bright enough in the visible for wavefront correction by adaptive optics .",
    "targets satisfying these requirements are rare .    with k@xmath29 mag ( 2mass catalog ) and v@xmath30 mag ( rydgren et al .",
    "1976 ) , and an estimated projected semi - major axis of 11 mas , haro 1 - 14c is suitable study for study by the combined techniques of ir interferometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the measurements will yield the component masses , system distance ( hence total luminosity ) , component flux ratios at the wavelengths of the interferometric and spectroscopic observations ( enabling apportionment of the luminosity between the components ) , and estimates of the effective temperature ( from the best matching templates for the analysis of the spectra ) .",
    "these parameters , together with the reasonable assumption of equal age of the components , will enable definitive tests of theoretical calculations of pms evolution at masses below 0.5 @xmath1 ( e.g. simon et al . 2000 ; hillenbrand and white 2004 ) .",
    "we have detected the secondary in the pms binary haro 1 - 14c by high spectral resolution observations at @xmath31 m . we find that :    \\1 ) the mass ratio of @xmath32 suggests that for an estimated photometric mass of 1.2 @xmath1 for the primary , the secondary mass is @xmath33 .",
    "\\2 ) assuming these estimated masses , the projected orbital semi - major axis is @xmath34 au . at an assumed 140 pc distance to the ophiuchus sfr ,",
    "the binary is angularly resolvable with the current generation of interferometers operating in the near - ir .",
    "\\3 ) astrometric measurements that map the binary orbit , and continued spectroscopic observations that improve the precision of the mass ratio offer the promise to measure the distance to the binary and the masses of its components at the few percent level .",
