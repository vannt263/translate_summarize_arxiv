    "a 3-d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation is used to understand the effects of orbital motion on the wwc region formed between  and , and the spatial orientation of the wwc surface on the sky as a function of phase .",
    "the 3-d sph simulation in this letter is identical to that used in , with the exception of the size of the computational domain , which here is a factor of ten smaller in order to focus on the dynamics of the inner wwc zone .",

    "before examining the directional illumination of s circumstellar ejecta , it is important to understand the physical origin of the observed nuv flux . according to the 2-d radiative transfer model of g11,g12 , regions in line - of - sight to the wind cavity carved by  are exposed to a larger nuv flux ( red line of figure  [ fig1 ] ) than regions in line - of - sight to only the extended wind of  ( blue line of figure  [ fig1 ] ) . between 1800 and 2600 ,",
    "these modified wind models of  have a flux that is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the flux of .",
    "we assume for  a temperature of 35,000 k and luminosity of @xmath24  @xmath10  ( h06 ) .",
    "since @xmath24  @xmath10  is an upper limit for the luminosity of  @xcite , the flux contribution from  could very likely be even less than what is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "therefore , we find that  does not contribute a substantial fraction of the observed f220w nuv flux in directions away from  and can not explain the observed f220w nuv excess .",
    "rather , we suggest that the nuv excess in the f220w images is regulated by the time - dependent nature of the wwc cavity carved by , which has two very important effects on s extended wind photosphere .",
    "first , lines - of - sight through the low - density wwc cavity have significantly reduced fe  ii optical depths ( g11,g12 ) .",
    "this reduction is especially pronounced in the f220w spectral region , which is full of fe ii lines (;",
    "second , s photosphere is extremely extended at uv wavelengths ( ) , leading to a significant bore - hole effect @xcite at phases around periastron , wherein the wwc cavity creates a hole , allowing increased escape of continuum radiation from the exposed hotter , deeper layers of s photosphere .    because  is located well within the wwc cavity , @xmath2510% of the f220w flux that reaches circumstellar ejecta exposed to the cavity comes from .",
    "therefore , the time - dependent directional exposure of circumstellar material to excess f220w nuv flux most likely depends on the phase - dependent spatial orientation of the wwc cavity , and not just the obstruction of s nuv flux by s wind .",
    "using our 3-d sph model we investigated the phase - dependent spatial orientation of the wwc cavity for different orbital orientations with the goal of determining which orientations are capable of explaining the _ hst _ f220w nuv images of . for simplicity , each orientation discussed in this paper assumes that the orbital axis of the binary system is closely aligned in 3-d with the polar axis of the homunculus nebula at an inclination @xmath26 and position angle on the sky of @xmath27 .",
    "a quantitative description of changes in the amplitude of the flux in the f220w images is deferred to future work as a 3-d radiative transfer code is necessary for such an analysis .",
    "below , we compare the spatial location of features in the individual f220w images to those expected from the model based on the 3-d orientation of the wwc cavity opening .",
    "compass directions ( ne = north - east , etc . ) are used in the descriptions below .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show that the binary orientation proposed by is capable of reasonably explaining the observed time - variable nuv ` excess ' emission seen in the f220w images .",
    "hereafter , the terms ` nuv excess ' and ` nuv deficit ' refer to an increase and decrease , respectively , in the f220w nuv flux as compared to the average nuv flux of phases between 0.865 and 0.061 .",
    "at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the observed nuv excess emission in the f220w images is brightest in regions in line - of - sight to the central stellar source and is elongated from ne to sw .",
    "is far enough from  at these phases that orbital velocities are low and the wwc cavity maintains a simple axisymmetric cone - like shape ( top two rows of figure  2 ; also @xcite ; ) . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the wwc cavity is open mostly toward the observer and is elongated in directions from the ne to the sw on the sky , causing the fe  ii optical depths in those directions to be reduced ( g12 ) . as a result ,",
    "material in these directions should be exposed to a higher f220w nuv flux than the one - year average flux of phases between 0.865 and 0.061 .",
    "the nuv excess thus occurs in these directions at these two phases because at later times the inner wwc cavity has a different 3-d spatial orientation ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the models predict that because orbital velocities are low , the orientation of the wwc cavity should not change much between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , implying that the spatial orientation and amount of observed nuv excess should also not change much .",
    "the f220w images show that this is the case .    by @xmath31 ( bottom row of figure  [ fig2 ] ) ,",
    "the spatial orientation of the inner wwc cavity has changed , pointing more in directions to the sw on the sky .",
    "the wwc cavity at this phase is warped due to orbital motion .",
    "the f220w image shows an observed nuv excess in directions to the nw , sw , and se , with darker , below - average - flux regions to the ne . according to our model and interpretation , material to the nw , sw , and se",
    "should have a nuv excess as it is exposed to a heavily modified primary wind .",
    "the darker region to the ne is likely due to there being more primary wind material in this direction at this phase compared to the average of all phases .    at @xmath32 ,",
    "the inner wwc region has started to take on a spiral shape and points mainly in directions to the s on the sky and partly away from the observer ( top row of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the f220w image shows nuv excesses to the s and e on the sky , with dark nuv - deficit regions to the n and w . at @xmath32 ,",
    "there is a significant bore - hole effect concentrated in directions to the s on the sky .",
    "the primary wind is carved to the s as well , which should allow the increased flux from the bore - hole to reach material in this direction . since there is no bore - hole effect to the s at the other phases , we expect a nuv excess in material there at @xmath32 .",
    "similar reasoning explains why there is also a nuv deficit to the n and w.    at @xmath33 ( middle row of figure  [ fig3 ] ) , the inner @xmath16 region of the f220w image is very dark .",
    "the inner wwc cavity gets highly distorted and the additional nuv radiation that would escape from the inner layers of  becomes embedded and trapped by its dense wind .",
    "therefore , a nuv deficit and a large dark region appears in the f220w difference image .    by @xmath34 ( bottom row of figure  [ fig3 ] ) ,",
    "orbital speeds have decreased and the wwc cavity has started to increase in size in directions to the nne on the sky , significantly carving the wind of  in this direction .",
    "consequently , one would expect a significant decrease in the amount of fe  ii absorption in directions to the nne compared to the average , and thus an observed nuv excess .",
    "there is also more wind material from  in directions to the s compared to the average , which should cause a nuv deficit .",
    "the f220w image shows that there is indeed an observed nuv excess to the nne and a dark region to the s .",
    "we find that only binary orientations with @xmath35 are capable of reasonably explaining the _ extended _",
    "( @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) nuv excess emission observed in the f220w images .",
    "other orientations appear to have extreme difficulty explaining the nuv variability .",
    "for example , at an orientation of @xmath38 ( top row of figure  [ fig4 ] ) , during most of the binary orbit , the wwc cavity is open and pointing away from the observer and to the e / se .",
    "thus , between @xmath28 and @xmath39 , the observer should detect the nuv radiation field from the unmodified wind of  on the central stellar source , and a possible nuv excess to the e / se . at @xmath34 ,",
    "due to the wrapping of the wwc region , a nuv excess would be expected to the s. yet , the spatial location of the observed bright and dark spots is nearly the exact opposite .",
    "however , we find that the nuv variability on the central stellar source ( central @xmath40 ) additionally constrains the orbital orientation to values of @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the f220w images at @xmath28 , 0.925 , and 0.985 show an observed nuv excess on the central stellar source , while @xmath32 , 0.031 , and 0.061 show a deficit (; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to have a nuv excess on the central source before periastron , the wwc cavity should be open mostly toward the observer at these phases .",
    "nuv deficits after periastron are due to increased amounts of primary wind material ( compared to the average ) at these times .",
    "this appears to be the case for @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , assuming @xmath41 , for example , the wwc cavity opens away from the observer at phases @xmath28 to 0.003 ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) . at @xmath34",
    ", the wwc spirals in between the observer and ( bottom row figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this would lead one to expect a nuv deficit before periastron and an excess after if @xmath41 , which is not seen in the observations .",
    "moreover , binary orientations that lie significantly outside the range @xmath2 to @xmath3 have great difficulty explaining other multi - wavelength diagnostics of  since such orientations place the observer s line - of - sight through s optically - thick wind for most of the orbital period ( @xcite ; ; g11,g12 ) .",
    "in contrast , the 3-d orientation and direction of orbit proposed by appears consistent with all known observations of  to date , including those analyzed here .",
    "the results of this letter go well beyond constraining the orientation of s binary orbit .",
    "it is clear that the motion of the wwc cavity as  moves about in its highly elliptical orbit leads to an important ` lighthouse effect ' in , wherein circum - binary ejecta is exposed to a time- _ and _ direction - dependent modified nuv radiation field of  caused by a bore - hole effect and decrease in fe ii optical depths .",
    "this lighthouse effect is crucial for understanding how nuv light escapes the  system and the phase - dependent illumination of distant ejecta in different directions .",
    "the lighthouse effect also provides a valuable diagnostic for helping constrain the exact timing of periastron .",
    "based on the available observations of and the simple model in this letter , periastron should occur between @xmath31 and @xmath33 , most likely very close to @xmath32 since this is when some nuv excess is still visible to the se in the difference images ( i.e. before distortion of the wwc cavity causes the nuv radiation to be trapped by s dense wind ) .",
    "future spatially - resolved observations with better time sampling , together with detailed 3-d radiative transfer models , can help place much tighter constraints on the exact timing of periastron , and possibly the orbital eccentricity .",
    "we emphasize that future observations of  should focus not only on phases around @xmath42 , but also on the extended recovery period up until @xmath43 , during which time the wwc cavity is increasing in size and reestablishing its axisymmetric cone - like shape .",
    "future monitoring of these phases is crucial for determining when various forms of radiation can escape via the wwc cavity in directions away from .",
