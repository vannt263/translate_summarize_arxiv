    "the fast development of quantum information in the last two decades has strengthened the notion that entanglement is not only a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics but also a resource for processing and transmitting information . for bipartite systems ,",
    "the relationship between entanglement measures and the use of entanglement for specific tasks like teleportation @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite is well understood .",
    "however , the exact role of multipartite entanglement in communication protocols and in quantum computation is still an open question . in the multipartite context ,",
    "many different measures and kinds of entanglement are possible @xcite .",
    "but it is still unclear what is the relevance of these measures for quantifying the ability of performing different tasks , and what is the role of each kind of entanglement in surpassing the classical gain for a given protocol .",
    "we show in this paper that these questions are particularly relevant for open systems .",
    "indeed , different kinds of entanglement can behave quite differently under decoherence .",
    "once the resource for a given protocol is ( non)robust against perturbations , this implies that the protocol itself should also be ( non)robust . in fact , we show here that the comparison between the effect of the environment on the many kinds of entanglement for a multipartite system , used as a resource for a given task , and the effect of decoherence on how well the task is achieved indicates which type of entanglement is relevant for accomplishing it .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement , for a wide class of entangled states , have been extensively analyzed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the non - unitary evolution depends intrinsically on the system - environment dynamics and the quantum entangled state under consideration . besides a more general treatment restricted to a two - qubit case given in @xcite , all analysis",
    "have restricted themselves to particular initial entangled states evolving under some specific dynamics @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the dynamics of entanglement is quite distinct from the dynamics of populations and coherences .",
    "in particular , entanglement may vanish at a finite time , much before the asymptotic decay of the coherences @xcite .    for multipartite systems the problem gets more involved since there are inequivalent classes of entangled states @xcite , that is , states that are not connected by local operations and classical communication ( locc s ) .",
    "states that can be obtained from each other through locc s belong to the same class of states , meaning that these states are equivalent resources for a large class of tasks in quantum information , those that are invariant under locc s , like teleportation @xcite and distillation @xcite .",
    "many of the investigations on the open - system dynamics of entanglement refer to @xmath0 states @xcite @xmath1 subject to the normalization condition @xmath2 .    another class of entangled states , the @xmath3 states @xmath4 were introduced in @xcite , where it was shown that they are inequivalent to the @xmath0 states .",
    "it is easy to see that the entanglement of @xmath3 states is more robust than that of @xmath0 states upon loss of a particle @xcite . given this symptomatic entanglement robustness of @xmath3 states , it is natural to ask which class of states , @xmath0 or @xmath3 , is more robust in a more general situation where each part of a multipartite state is undergoing decoherence .",
    "the entanglement dynamics analysis of @xmath3 and @xmath0 states is relevant on its own , since these states are resources for quantum information protocols as quantum teleportation , dense coding and secure distribution of quantum keys @xcite , and have been experimentally produced in many kinds of physical systems including atoms in cavities , trapped ions and entangled photons @xcite .",
    "the simple form of @xmath5-partite @xmath0 states has allowed several analytical derivations of the associated entanglement dynamics @xcite .",
    "an interesting conclusion was drawn for multipartite @xmath0 states subjected to local environments @xcite : the time at which bipartite ( and multipartite ) entanglement becomes arbitrarily small can occur well before the disentanglement time ; this time difference strongly increases with the number of particles .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath0 states , the time for which entanglement becomes arbitrarily small better characterizes the entanglement robustness than the disentanglement time . on the other hand ,",
    "the global entanglement of @xmath3 states was shown to be more robust : the decay rate is size independent for dephasing and zero temperature environments @xcite .",
    "this previous work motivates the question on how other types of entanglement , defined between different kinds of partitions of the state , behave for @xmath3 states under decoherence .",
    "the physical meaning of these different types of entanglement and the corresponding measures is also relevant , the important question being how do they relate to possible applications in computation and communication .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the original @xmath3 state ( [ wstate ] ) and related states , referred to as @xmath3-like states , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 we show that , when considering bipartite entanglement , these states display the same kind of non - robustness than the @xmath0 states . for two kinds of decoherence , we derive an analytical expression , valid for any entanglement measure , which can be expressed as the entanglement of that of considerably smaller subsystems , in the same spirit as in @xcite . in the dephasing case ,",
    "the bipartite and global entanglement in @xmath3 states remain both very robust when the number of particles increases , the disentanglement time being equivalent in this case to the time at which entanglement becomes very small . under the amplitude damping channel , these two time scales become quite distinct : the bipartite entanglement as quantified by the negativity @xcite , for a sufficiently large @xmath5 , decays below an arbitrarily small value much before it vanishes , in spite of the fact that the global entanglement is size independent .",
    "this clearly shows how differently can distinct kinds of entanglement behave under decoherence . adopting a more practical point of view and explicitly considering as tasks the teleportation @xcite and the splitting @xcite of quantum information",
    ", we show that the dynamics of fidelity for each of these protocols , when using as a resource an entangled state undergoing decoherence , can be identified with the decay of a specific kind of entanglement measure , thus allowing the identification of each of these measures with a well - defined task .",

    "[ ed ] , we introduce a method that allows for the calculation of the entanglement corresponding to a given bipartition of a @xmath3 or @xmath3-like multipartite state through the calculation of the entanglement of a two - qubit system , which greatly simplifies the analysis of the dynamics of entanglement for this kind of state .",
    "this technique is used in sec .",

    "the quite different features under decoherence of these quantifiers is shown in sec .",

    "[ conc ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "detailed calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "the dynamics of a system interacting with an environment can be described in the kraus form @xcite , so that the density operator of the evolved system is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are positive - operator valued measures ( povm s ) satisfying @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the initial state of the system .",
    "we analyze here the entanglement dynamics of the states ( [ wstate ] ) , ( [ wlike ] ) , ( [ wlike0a ] ) and ( [ wlike0b ] ) , evolving under the action of two paradigmatic noisy channels : dephasing and amplitude damping .",
    "the states are described in the computational basis @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the qubits have identical interactions with their own individual environments , and neglect the mutual interaction between qubits .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath14-th qubit , @xmath15 , is then described by a completely positive trace - preserving map ( or channel ) @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 , while the evolution of the @xmath5-qubit system is given by the composition of all @xmath5 individual maps : @xmath18 . the assumption of mutually independent and identical environments is well justified whenever the separation between the particles is much larger than a typical length associated with the environment ( like a resonant wavelength of an electromagnetic environment ) , so that collective effects do not need to be taken into account .",
    "the phase damping ( or dephasing ) channel ( @xmath19 ) represents the situation in which there is loss of coherence with probability @xmath20 , but without any energy exchange .",
    "it is defined as @xmath21 the application of this map in the computational basis @xmath22 clearly does not affect the populations , but all the original coherences @xmath23 get reduced by a decay factor @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitude - damping channel ( @xmath25 ) is given , in the born - markov approximation , via its kraus representation , as:@xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ". here @xmath29 stands for the excited state and @xmath30 for the ground state of a two - level system . in this case , the population of the excited state is reduced by a factor @xmath31 , while the population of the ground state is equal to the initial population plus the contribution coming from the upper state , which is equal to @xmath20 multiplied by the initial population of that state .",
    "the coherences , on the other hand , are reduced by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 in channels ( [ dephasing ] ) and ( [ amplitude damping ] ) is a convenient parametrization of time : @xmath33 refers to the initial time @xmath34 and @xmath35 refers to the asymptotic t@xmath36 limit . in the markovian approximation , and for the amplitude channel",
    ", one has @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the decay rate of the excited state .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known weisskopf - wigner approximation .",
    "it should be remarked that these two maps , when acting on @xmath0 state ( [ ghz ] ) and @xmath3-like states ( [ wstate ] ) , ( [ wlike ] ) , ( [ wlike0a ] ) , and ( [ wlike0b ] ) , do not create new coherences , but for the amplitude - damping channel new diagonal terms ( populations ) may be created .",
    "to investigate the entanglement features of the states here considered and the relation of these features with different communication tasks , we compare different quantifiers of entanglement .",
    "in particular , we evaluate explicitly the dynamics of the negativity @xcite and concurrence @xcite , measures of bipartite entanglement in a given bipartition of a multipartite state , and of the meyer - wallach measure of global entanglement ( @xmath39 ) @xcite .",
    "we also compare the negativity , concurrence and the @xmath39 measure with the generalized concurrence @xcite , a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that had its dynamics in the @xmath3 state ( [ wstate ] ) numerically calculated in @xcite .",
    "the negativity , given a bipartition @xmath40 of a multipartite state , is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed ( @xmath41 ) density matrix @xmath42 @xcite , which can be defined in terms of the trace norm @xmath43 , the sum of moduli of the eigenvalues of @xmath42 , as @xcite@xmath44 in general , the negativity fails to quantify entanglement of some entangled states ( those with positive partial transposition ) in dimensions higher than six @xcite .",
    "however , for the states considered here , under the influence of the two maps considered in the previous section , dephasing and amplitude damping , the negativity vanishes only when the state is a separable one .",
    "so , in these cases , the negativity brings all the relevant information about the separability in bipartitions of the states ( i.e. , null negativity means separability in the corresponding partition ) .",
    "in particular , as we show in the following section , the bipartite entanglement problem for @xmath3-like states ( [ wstate ] ) , ( [ wlike ] ) , ( [ wlike0a ] ) , and ( [ wlike0b ] ) , can always be reduced to two qubits , a situation where the negativity is an unambiguous entanglement quantifier .",
    "the concurrence @xcite for a given bipartition @xmath40 of a multipartite pure state @xmath45 is @xmath46 being @xmath47 .",
    "this measure can be extended over the mixed states @xmath48 by virtue of a convex roof construction @xcite @xmath49 an optimization that can be analytically evaluated for two - qubit states , the minimum in this case is obtained by @xmath50 with @xmath51 the eigenvalues , @xmath52 denoting the largest among them , of the matrix @xmath53 , where the conjugation is taken with respect to the computational basis @xmath54 .    for a pure state @xmath55 of @xmath5 qubits and a partition @xmath56 ,",

    "the quantity @xmath57 can be taken @xcite as the mutual information@xmath64 with @xmath65 being the linear entropy . since @xmath55 is pure , @xmath66 , the entropies of the two parts @xmath67 and @xmath68 are identical , and therefore @xmath69 .",
    "for example , for two - qubit pure states , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the square of the concurrence @xcite and is called the @xmath72-tangle . for three - qubit pure states",
    ", the corresponding nonlocal information between @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be written as @xmath75 with @xmath70 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , where the @xmath78-tangle @xmath79 has been shown to be a well - defined measure of genuine three - qubit entanglement @xcite .    the @xmath39 measure for entanglement @xcite for a pure state @xmath55 of @xmath5 qubits",
    "can be expressed as @xcite @xmath80 an average over the entanglement ( square of the concurrence ) of each qubit with the rest of the system . from eqs .",
    "( [ biasmulti ] ) and ( [ sab ] ) we can see that the @xmath39 measure can be distributed among different kinds of nonlocal information@xmath81 from this last equation it is clear that the @xmath39 measure depends on the different forms of quantum correlations present in the entangled state and in fact it was originally described @xcite as a global entanglement measure . however , the @xmath39 measure precludes a detailed knowledge of the different quantum correlations @xmath62 in the system .",
    "for example , it can not distinguish fully entangled states from states that , in spite of being entangled , are separable in some of their subsystems @xcite .",
    "the generalized concurrence @xcite is a natural extension of the concurrence ( [ concqudit ] ) for multipartite n - qubit states and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 labels all possible reduced density matrices .",
    "note that the expression inside the square - root is nothing more than the sum of the concurrences in all possible bipartitions .",
    "the generalized concurrence can detect real multipartite correlations and it allows one to compare the degree of entanglement of multipartite systems with different numbers of constituents , as opposed to the @xmath39 measure .    in the following section ,",
    "we show that , for the states ( [ wstate ] ) , ( [ wlike ] ) , ( [ wlike0a ] ) , and ( [ wlike0b ] ) , any convex ( bipartite or multipartite ) entanglement quantifier that does not increase under locc s , in any given partition , can be expressed in terms of that of a considerably smaller subsystem consisting only of those qubits lying on the boundary of the partition .",
    "no optimization on the full system s parameter space is required throughout .",
    "following the same line of thought as in @xcite , we decompose the @xmath3 state as a set of two - qubit unitary transformations acting on a separable state ; the unitary transformations that act inside the parts are local unitary operations with respect to the partition and therefore do not change its entanglement .    to generate the states @xmath84 and @xmath85 using two qubits operations and starting with a separable state , we need to apply a series of operations of the type @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the qubits affected by the transformation , while @xmath88 and @xmath89 are parameters defining the transformation .",

    "so the entanglement in this case can be seen to be @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the passage from ( [ wdecoheredasu ] ) to ( [ entanglement1xrestadreduced ] ) follows from the fact that the local addition of ancillas does not change the entanglement .",
    "this is similar to the strategy adopted in @xcite , where it was shown that the entanglement dynamics in a given partition of a graph state is the same as the one of the particles in the boundary of the partition . for a bipartition @xmath103 we can order the unitary transformations so that the @xmath3 state is expressed as @xmath104 following the same reasoning ,",

    "depending on the way the entangled state is partitioned , the order of the operators @xmath92 must be properly chosen so as to factor out the unitary transformations that are irrelevant for the entanglement in the partition under consideration .",

    "this is true for any bipartition of a @xmath0 state @xcite , but as we have shown this is no longer true for any bipartion of a @xmath3 state ( [ wstate ] ) .",

    "the more unbalanced is the bipartition the worse is the initial teleportation fidelity and the faster will be the fidelity decay under decoherence .",

    "( [ ad - decay ] ) with @xmath145 .",
    "the negativity in the bipartition used for the teleportation in the state ( [ assymetricw ] ) under @xmath25 is such that @xmath164 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ teleportationbound ] ) , is equal to @xmath197 .",
    "this implies that not only is the protocol robust , but also it is the best possible .",
    "the same is not true for the @xmath0 protocol under decoherence , since @xmath198 decays exponentially with @xmath5 and along the evolution this fidelity can be under the classical limit , in spite of the fact that the negativity is null only in the asymptotic limit @xmath199 .",
    "the teleportation fidelities are plotted in fig .",

    "the @xmath172 protocol is the best possible under @xmath25 and throughout its evolution always leads to fidelities above the classical threshold , while the @xmath0 protocol leads to fidelities below the classical threshold . ]",
    "the resource state used for the decodification is given by ( [ assymetricaftermeasurement ] ) , which is a @xmath3-like state ( [ wlike0a ] ) , which has a global entanglement decay independent of @xmath5 , while its bipartite entanglement , quantified by the negativity , depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the fidelity of the whole protocol is size independent is a clear indication that the decodification part of the protocol depends on the global entanglement , which should be expected since this decodification depends on all parts in a symmetric way .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the decays of the entanglement and of the fidelity indicates on which kind of entanglement the task relies . in the decoherent scenario ,",
    "similar but non - identical protocols can rely on different types of entanglement , which can imply distinct robustness of these distinct tasks . for the teleportation and splitting of quantum information , protocols based on @xmath3-like states are clearly much more robust than @xmath0-based protocols .",
    "the characterization of entanglement for multipartite systems is a complex endeavor , in view of the many possible partitionings of the state and the possibility of having , for a given partition , many possible quantifiers .",
    "even for two qubits , two widely used quantifiers , the concurrence and the negativity , do not lead to consistent results when comparing the entanglement of two states .",
    "this motivates the search for criteria that would associate each quantifier with a different physical task .",
    "this problem becomes even more pressing when considering the effects of the environment .",
    "different quantifiers may display quite distinct behaviors under decoherence .",
    "this motivates a natural question : can these different dynamics be associated to the robustness of inequivalent communication tasks ?    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that two of those quantifiers , proposed for estimating global and bipartite entanglements , respectively , do behave quite distinctively under decoherence , and that this divergent behavior is directly related to the robustness of two inequivalent communication tasks .",
    "we have made a detailed comparison between the use of @xmath0 or @xmath3 states as resources for quantum communication in a noisy environment , by applying a new technique that allows a reduction of the @xmath3-state entanglement dynamics to that of a two - qubit system .",
    "this technique could be possibly applied to other classes of entangled states under different kinds of environment .",
    "our approach suggests that the eventual ambiguities in the definition of entanglement quantifiers should be resolved by associating each quantifiers with a definite physical task .",
    "in order to show that ( [ wonly2tangle ] ) is valid for the @xmath3-like states @xmath200 , we employ the @xmath39 measure in the form proposed in @xcite,@xmath201 here l@xmath202 is a @xmath203 map @xmath204 where @xmath205 means absence of the term @xmath206 and @xmath207 is the computational basis with @xmath206=@xmath208 .",
    "so when l@xmath202 acts on an n - dimensional vector state @xmath191 , it generates an ( n-1)-dimensional vector state @xmath209 , being k=@xmath210 .",
    "the quantity @xmath211 is a distance defined by @xmath212 the application of the operator @xmath213 to the @xmath214 gives @xmath215 therefore @xmath216 and the @xmath39 entanglement measure for @xmath217 is thus @xmath218 tracing out , in the state @xmath217 , every qubit but qubits @xmath14 and @xmath219 , the two - qubit density matrix @xmath131 becomes @xmath220 the concurrence of this state is given by @xmath221 and so the 2-tangle is @xmath222 . from this result and from ( [ mwa ] ) it can be easily seen that @xmath223 therefore , the global entanglement of state @xmath214 is completely characterized by its @xmath72-tangles .",
