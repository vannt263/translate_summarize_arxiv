    "a cluster category is a certain 2-calabi - yau orbit category of the derived category of a hereditary abelian category .",
    "cluster categories were introduced in @xcite in order to give a categorical model for the combinatorics of fomin - zelevinsky cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "they are triangulated @xcite and admit ( cluster-)tilting objects , which model the clusters of a corresponding ( acyclic ) cluster algebra @xcite . each cluster in a fixed cluster algebra comes together with a finite quiver , and in the categorical model this quiver is in fact the gabriel quiver of the corresponding tilting object @xcite .",
    "a principal ingredient in the construction of a cluster algebra is quiver mutation .",
    "it controls the exchange procedure which gives a rule for producing a new cluster variable and hence a new cluster from a given cluster .",
    "exchange is modeled by cluster categories in the acyclic case @xcite in terms of a mutation rule for tilting objects , i.e. a rule for replacing an indecomposable direct summand in a tilting object with another indecomposable rigid object , to get a new tilting object .",
    "quiver mutation describes the relation between the gabriel quivers of the corresponding tilting objects .",
    "analogously to the definition of the cluster category , for a positive integer @xmath0 , it is natural to define a certain @xmath1-calabi - yau orbit category of the derived category of a hereditary abelian category .",
    "this is called the _",
    "@xmath0-cluster category_. implicitly , @xmath0-cluster categories was first studied in @xcite , and their ( cluster-)tilting objects have been studied in @xcite .",
    "combinatorial descriptions of @xmath0-cluster categories in dynkin type @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given in @xcite .    in cluster categories",
    "the mutation rule for tilting objects is described in terms of certain triangles called _ exchange triangles_. by @xcite the existence of exchange triangles generalizes to @xmath0-cluster categories .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there are exactly @xmath1 non - isomorphic complements to an almost complete tilting object , and that they are determined by the @xmath1 exchange triangles defined in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a combinatorial description of mutation in @xmath0-cluster categories . _ a priori _",
    ", one might expect to be able to do this by keeping track of the gabriel quivers of the tilting objects .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the gabriel quivers do not contain enough information .    we proceed to associate to a tilting object a quiver each of whose arrows has an associated colour @xmath4 . the arrows with colour 0 form the gabriel quiver of the tilting object .",
    "we then define a mutation operation on coloured quivers and show that it is compatible with mutation of tilting objects .",
    "a consequence is that the effect of an arbitrary sequence of mutations on a tilting object in an @xmath0-cluster category can be calculated by a purely combinatorial procedure .",
    "our definition of a coloured quiver associated to a tilting object makes sense in any @xmath1-calabi - yau category , such as for example those studied in @xcite .",
    "we hope that our constructions may shed some light on mutation of tilting objects in this more general setting .    in section 1 , we review some elementary facts about higher cluster categories . in section 2 , we explain how to define the coloured quiver of a tilting object , we define coloured quiver mutation , and we state our main theorem . in sections 3 and 4 , we state some further lemmas about higher cluster categories , and we prove certain properties of the coloured quivers of tilting objects .",
    "we prove our main result in sections 5 and 6 . in sections 7 and 8",
    "we point out some applications . in section 9",
    "we interpret our construction in terms of @xmath0-cluster complexes . in section 10",
    ", we give an alternative algorithm for computing coloured quiver mutation .",
