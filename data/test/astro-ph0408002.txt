    "to fully understand the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) and the workings of the central engines that power them , we must first understand their energetics . the wide dispersion in isotropic grb energies , once corrected for their jet - like geometry , results in a narrowly - clustered radiated energy @xmath1 erg @xcite .",
    "likewise , the kinetic energy @xmath2 of the outflow , as derived from the afterglow emission @xcite , is clustered around a similar value @xcite .",
    "the close agreement between the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 have lead to the prevailing view that grb explosions draw from a standard energy reservoir with a total budget of order a few times 10@xmath0 erg",
    ".    appeared to challenge this view .",
    "a distinct break in the optical and x - ray light curves at @xmath4 d @xcite if interpreted as a jet , gives an opening angle @xmath5 and a radiated energy ( corrected for the narrow opening angle ) @xmath6 erg  nearly 30 times below the `` standard '' value .",
    "is also an order of magnitude under - energetic as measured by the geometrically - corrected x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "other low energy outliers in the e@xmath7 distribution @xcite and x - ray luminosity distribution do exist .",
    "these energy outliers are important for understanding the diversity of cosmic explosions",
    ". they may represent genuine low energy events , a long - lived central engine , the viewing of a jet slightly off axis , or events for which the efficiency of converting the kinetic energy in the shock to radiation is low .    for  two different mechanisms",
    "have been proposed , both of which increase increase @xmath2 to about @xmath8 erg . to explain the continued rise of the radio emission over the following week",
    ", @xcite introduced a wide - angle jet ( @xmath9 ) with a lower lorentz factor than the narrow jet but carrying @xmath10 more energy .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that grbs share a common energy scale _ only _ when the total energy , including that in mildly relativistic ejecta , is considered .",
    "another variant of the standard energy hypothesis is to include a long - lived central engine .",
    "this was first proposed to account for an extended bright phase of afterglow emission of grb021004 @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have argued that such model could also explain the bumps in the optical light curves @xcite and the rising radio light curves ( qualitatively at least ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that there are grounds to question the simplest hypothesis for grb explosions .",
    "further progress on the nature of the central engines will most certainly involve measuring and modeling the temporal and angular behavior of the energy release .",
    "nonetheless , the _ total _ energy yield of these explosions is perhaps the most important bulk parameter of cosmic explosions .",
    "fortunately , as has been noted in the past @xcite , late - time radio observations offer us precisely this opportunity . here",
    ", we report on observations of the radio afterglow of  on a timescale of 60 days to 366 days . using these observations in conjunction with the earlier radio data @xcite",
    ", we are able to infer a geometry - independent estimate of the total energy of .",
    "all observations were made with the very large array ( vla ) and reduced following standard practice ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a summary of the flux density measurements are in table [ tab : obs ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] we plot the radio light curves supplemented with our earlier data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a significant flattening of the late - time radio light curves at @xmath11 d can be seen , especially when compared to the steep decline measured at early times at higher frequencies ( 22.5 - 250 ghz ) where the temporal slope @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 days .",
    "this flattening is achromatic , except at 1.43 ghz where the light curve was still rising , reaching a maximum near 300 d. a joint temporal and spectral power - law fit of the form @xmath15 for @xmath16 d at 4.86 , 8.46 , 15 and 22.5 ghz gives @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a similar flattening of the x - ray emission is seen by _ xmm - newton _ in which the decay index changed from @xmath19 to @xmath20 between 1.24 and 37 days and 37 and 258 days after the burst @xcite . the late - time x - ray spectral index @xmath21 .",
    "the difference in the radio / x - ray spectral slopes , @xmath22 is of the right magnitude ( @xmath23 ) if these bands lie on either side of the synchrotron cooling frequency , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest explanation for an achromatic flattening of afterglow light curves at late times is that the blast wave has become trans - relativistic .",
    "such a transition occurs when the rest mass energy swept up by the expanding shock becomes comparable to the initial kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "given the jet parameters of , this is predicted to occur roughly at a time t@xmath25 d @xcite .",
    "in the non - relativistic regime the temporal index in a constant density medium ( ism ) is @xmath26 for @xmath27 or @xmath28 for @xmath29 ; here @xmath30 is the energy index of the electrons accelerated into a shock , and it is related to the spectral slope @xmath31 for @xmath29 , and @xmath32 for @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , in the relativistic regime , the flux is expected to steeply decline , @xmath33 independent of frequency .",
    "similar expressions exist for a a wind - blown medium ( wind ) whose density varies as the inverse square of the radius : @xmath34 for @xmath27 or @xmath35 for @xmath29 @xcite .    applying the above expressions for @xmath27 to the radio measurements of @xmath36 and @xmath37 gives @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( ism ) and @xmath40 ( wind ) .",
    "thus the observed flattening of the radio light curves ( @xmath17 ) is consistent with a constant density medium , but a wind - blown medium predicts a decay that steeper than expected .",
    "a wind - blown medium is rejected at the 2.5@xmath41 level . applying the same expressions to the x - ray measurements where @xmath29 , we derive @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( ism ) and @xmath44 ( wind ) . by themselves ,",
    "the x - ray data is not able to distinguish between models while the radio favors the ism model .    given this good agreement ( both in the timescale and the magnitude of the flattening ) with the expectations of a jet expanding in a constant density medium , we are motivated to consider more detailed models in the following sections .",
    "initially the blast wave is expanding relativistically and thus we can use the extensive machinery developed for afterglow modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of our specific method are given in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the blast wave is assumed to accelerate a power - law distribution of electrons n(@xmath45 with energy index @xmath30 above some minimum energy @xmath46 .",
    "the emitted spectrum ( synchrotron and possibly inverse compton ) at any time @xmath47 can be described by the peak flux and several break frequencies whose evolution depends on the shock dynamics .",
    "prior to the jet break time @xmath48 the evolution is identical to a spherically symmetric shock @xcite , while for @xmath49 the evolution is described by a jet expanding in a constant density medium @xcite .",
    "after @xmath50 the evolution of the break frequencies is governed by sedov - taylor dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and discussed in the next section . to allow a smooth transition of the light curves , the normalization of the emission spectrum is determined by the equations for the jet model at @xmath51 .",
    "a total of six physical parameters were fitted for ; the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath52 of the jet , its half opening angle @xmath53 , the circumburst density @xmath54 , the electron energy index @xmath30 , and the fraction of the shock energy in electrons @xmath55 and in magnetic fields @xmath56 .",
    "we used only the radio and x - ray data since the optical data are dominated by the supernova 2003dh at late times .",
    "we show the results of our fit in figure [ fig : one ] and summarize the model parameters in table [ tab : bestfits ] .",
    "also in table [ tab : bestfits ] is the best - fit jet model from @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath53 from @xcite was originally derived using the isotropic gamma - ray energy and some _ assumed _ radiative efficiency . to be internally consistent",
    "we have re - computed @xmath53 in table [ tab : bestfits ] directly from the @xmath52 and @xmath54 using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "as noted above , after @xmath57 the blast wave becomes non - relativistic . on about the same timescale",
    "the side - ways expansion of the jet becomes important and eventually the blast wave becomes spherical .",
    "modeling the afterglow emission at late stages thus offer the distinct advantage of the inferred parameters being independent of the relative orientation of the axis of the jet and the line of sight to the observer .",
    "we follow the methodology of @xcite ( appendix a ) and @xcite .",
    "essentially the primary observable is the synchrotron self - absorbed radio spectrum with the peak flux density ( @xmath58 ) , the optical depth ( @xmath59 ) and the characteristic synchrotron frequency ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these parameters , in turn , are determined by the values of four physical parameters at @xmath61 : the magnetic field ( @xmath62 ) , the shock radius ( @xmath63 ) , the minimum lorentz factor of the electrons ( @xmath64 ) and the number density of the radiating electrons ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the evolution of the self - absorbed spectrum is governed by the dynamics of the blast wave .",
    "in particular , at late times the blast wave evolution is well described by the sedov - von neumann - taylor ( snt ) solution @xcite : @xmath66 ; speed ( in units of speed of light , @xmath67 ) @xmath68 ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we drop the nr subscript hereafter for clarity .",
    "there are four unknown parameters but usually only three observables ( but see  [ sec : cool ] ) .",
    "thus we must introduce additional constraints to fully specify a solution .",
    "we consider three possible constraints and these are discussed in turn .",
    "the standard approach in radio astronomy is to appeal to equipartition for an additional constraint .",
    "this means equating the fraction of energy in relativistic electrons , @xmath71\\times n_e \\gamma_m m_e c^2 v$ ] to the energy in magnetic fields , @xmath72 or @xmath73 . here , @xmath74 is the volume within the shell of emitting electrons , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the thickness of the shell and we use the standard ( thin shell ) assumption that @xmath77 .",
    "the density @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the shock compression factor .    under the assumption of equipartition",
    "we find the following best - fit solution for rest frame physical parameters : @xmath80 cm , implying @xmath81 g , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 days .    as a consistency check",
    ", we note that applying equation 13 of @xcite gives @xmath87 and thus we confirm that it is appropriate to apply the snt solution at @xmath57 .    because @xmath88 drops below our lowest frequency just before @xmath89 , the model parameters are given in terms of @xmath90 which is normalized to 1 ghz at @xmath57 for @xmath91 , in accordance with our relativistic modeling (  [ sec : bbmodel ] ) .",
    "using the model constraints above we derive @xmath92 erg .",
    "the total energy in the ejecta ( including shocked protons ) , derived from the sedov - taylor energy equation is @xmath93 erg .      instead of adopting the equipartition assumption in  [ sec : equi ]",
    ", we can use the more general constraint that the energy in the electrons and magnetic field does not exceed the thermal energy @xcite , @xmath94 .",
    "this constraint is a logical consequence of our assumption that the blast wave can be described by a sedov - taylor solution at late times .    for radii above ( below ) @xmath95 , the summed energy rises steeply as @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) when @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "with this method we can probe the parameter space _",
    "away from _ equipartition and derive a range of allowed values for @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig : energyradius ] shows the dependence of @xmath101 and @xmath102 on radius . as can be seen from the figure , the permitted values of the sedov - taylor energy are @xmath103 erg , corresponding to radius values of @xmath104 cm .",
    "this range of radii implies the following ranges for the physical parameters : @xmath105 g , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "late - time x - ray observations @xcite as in  [ sec : bbmodel ] allow us to constrain the cooling frequency @xmath110 , and hence determine the radius of the blastwave . in particular , x - ray observations allow us to model the evolution of the cooling frequency , @xmath111 @xcite . for the same value of @xmath90 used above : @xmath112 cm , @xmath113 g , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( table [ tab : bestfits ] ) . the total energy in the ejecta @xmath118 erg .",
    "the uncertainty in the energy is dominated by the flux density error of the x - ray observations at @xmath119 days .",
    "comparison of our derived size with the observed size offers the opportunity to directly verify models .",
    "normally such a comparison is inaccurate since the expected angular sizes are small and until recently , they were inferred from interstellar scintillation observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite have directly determined the size of the fireball for , measuring an angular diameter @xmath120 @xmath121as at @xmath122 d.    using sedov - taylor expansion ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath123 ) to scale to @xmath50=50 d , and assuming a lambda cosmology ( @xmath124  km / s / mpc , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) , the angular - diameter distance of  at @xmath127 is @xmath128mpc and its radius @xmath129 cm .",
    "thus it appears that the vlba measurement is at odds with the radius estimates deduced above , albeit at only 2@xmath41 significance ( see figure  [ fig : energyradius ] ) . to better understand this difference ( and to extract more robust estimates of @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) , it would be useful to jointly fit the evolution of the apparent size of   @xcite together with the evolution of the afterglow emission .",
    "continued monitoring of the afterglow of  has revealed an achromatic flattening (  [ sec : obs ] ) of the light curves whose magnitude and timescale are consistent with a jet - like outflow which is undergoing a dynamical transition to trans - relativistic expansion .",
    "we have modeled the entire dataset ( 1 - 366 d ) and derive a total kinetic energy of @xmath132 erg (  [ sec : bbmodel ] ) .",
    "this estimate agrees with a previous estimate of @xmath133 erg , based on observations from 1 - 64 d @xcite .",
    "thus our analysis is consistent with earlier conclusions that  was not an under - energetic burst @xcite .",
    "we also attempted to derive an independent estimate of the energy using only those observations beyond @xmath134 .",
    "the sedov - taylor analysis (  [ sec : nrmodel ] ) traces _ all _ ejecta regardless of the initial jet structure or the distribution of initial lorentz factors of the ejecta .",
    "this accurate calorimetric method has now been applied to , grb970508 and grb980703 @xcite . in this particular case ,",
    "the value of this approach is limited by the uncertainty in the exact value of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath88 .",
    "using the x - ray data as an added constraint (  [ sec : cool ] ) , and adopting @xmath88=1 ghz at @xmath50 we derive an energy of @xmath135 erg .    strictly speaking the kinetic energies given above are upper limits since they are derived at a fixed time ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the fireball undergoes radiative losses especially prior to the time when the evolution is in the fast cooling regime @xcite .",
    "we estimate from our full model in ",
    "[ sec : bbmodel ] that this fast - to - slow cooling transition occurs at @xmath136 d. at this time the total isotropic energy @xmath137 erg and the geometrically - corrected energy e@xmath138 erg .",
    "the energy ( isotropic or otherwise ) drops to 42% of this value at @xmath48 and 37% at @xmath50 .    with further observations of  we",
    "have an opportunity to look for departures in the standard blastwave model . at present ,",
    "the physical parameters of the blastwave derived from only the first two months ( table [ tab : bestfits ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide a remarkably good prediction of its subsequent behavior for up to a year later .",
    "deviations may be expected to occur at late times because of an injection of additional energy by slower moving ejecta , an evolution in the microphysical parameters of the shock ( @xmath30 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) with time , or a change in the density structure of circumburst medium .",
    "the current estimates of the energy and other physical parameters of  are accurate at best to a factor of two .",
    "while a more quantitative analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is needed , we can already rule out order of magnitude changes in e@xmath139 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "identifying changes in the density structure is more difficult because between 1 day and 1 year the blast wave samples only a small range of radii in its rest frame ( @xmath1400.1 to 0.4 pc ) . however , at its present rate of decay the afterglow of  will be visible at centimeter wavelengths for the next decade .",
    "thus the prospects for tracing the continued evolution of  are excellent .",
