    "compared to the x - ray luminosity , these objects are expected to be very weak in the optical and infrared ( i.e. , typically @xmath13 erg / s and @xmath14 ) regardless of whether this emission originates from the stellar surface or from the surrounding photoionized nebula ( cf .",

    "decay on timescales @xmath4 yrs if it was born spinning rapidly . a measurement of the period derivative @xmath10 would help test this model .",
    "the source rx j0720.4 - 3125 is an unidentified soft x - ray source seen by the einstein ipc ( image proportional counter ) , exosat le ( low energy detector ) , and , most recently , by the rosat pspc ( position sensitive proportional counter ) and hri ( high resolution imager ) . the data on this source is as follows ( haberl et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) : the rosat pspc count rate ( 0.1  2.4 kev ) is 1.6 cts / s , and based upon earlier detections by einstein and exosat , is steady ( no more than @xmath16% variation ) over many years . the x - ray spectrum is best fit by a black body of @xmath0 ev with a hydrogen absorption column density of @xmath17 @xmath18 . with this spectrum , the count rate corresponds to an unabsorbed photon energy flux of @xmath19 erg/@xmath20/s ( k. arnaud , priv .",
    "the source luminosity is then    @xmath21    where @xmath22 pc is the distance to the source .    in",
    "all pointed rosat observations , there is a _ periodic _ modulation in the x - ray flux with an 8.39 s period ( haberl et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "we interpret this as the rotation period of the source .",
    "since the rosat observations are separated by @xmath23 years , this indicates that the pulsed emission is steady .",
    "two pointed rosat hri observations ( haberl et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) secured the position of the source to be ( j2000 ) @xmath24 7h , 20 m , 24.90s ; @xmath25 - 31@xmath26 25@xmath27 51.3@xmath28 ( with @xmath29 uncertainty ) .",
    "the corresponding galactic coordinates are @xmath30 .",
    "optical observations at the south african astronomical observatory failed to detect an optical counterpart down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath31 , thereby placing a lower limit on the x - ray to optical flux ratio of @xmath32 ( haberl et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the observational evidence points consistently to an isolated neutron star as the source .",
    "we estimate the distance to the source from the ( low ) hydrogen column density ( @xmath33 @xmath18 ) . for the first @xmath34 pc , the line of sight to this source cuts through the local bubble where the mean hydrogen density is @xmath35 @xmath36 ( welsh et al .",
    "1994 , their figure 3 ) . beyond the local bubble ,",
    "the mean hydrogen density increases substantially to @xmath37 @xmath36 near the galactic plane ( dickey and lockman 1990 ) . taking an empty local bubble gives a rough upper bound to the distance of about 250 pc .",
    "given the very nonuniform matter distribution in the local interstellar medium ( e.g. , welsh et al .",
    "1994 ) , the actual distance could be much less than 250 pc .",
    "for instance , if the source intercepts diffuse cirrus , its distance could be closer to @xmath38 pc ( cf .",
    "wang and yu 1995 ) . a very conservative but strict upper bound on the distance",
    "is set by requiring the hot spot area to be much less than the star s surface area for pulsations to be observed .",
    "this implies @xmath39 , where @xmath40 cm is the stellar radius . for definiteness",
    ", we adopt 100 pc throughout this work as the source distance and scale our results to this value .",
    "our conclusions regarding magnetic field decay are not sensitive to the distance estimate .",

    "taylor , manchester , lyne 1993 ) .",
    "the absence of radio emission further argues against a young neutron star / pulsar origin .    if the source is a geminga - type ( @xmath15-ray loud , radio - quiet ) pulsar , then @xmath59 . adopting @xmath60 as for geminga ( halpern & holt 1992 ; swanenburg et al .",
    "1981 ; thompson et al .",

    "this is consistent with lack of detection by egret instruments aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( haberl et al .",
    "if the source is an isolated neutron star accreting from the surrounding medium , its mass accretion rate will be governed by the rate at which material is captured within the star s gravitational radius @xmath62 , and is given by ( cf .",
    "bondi 1952 ) @xmath63 , where @xmath64 g / s , @xmath65 is the stellar mass , @xmath66 is the hydrogen number density of the medium ( assumed to have solar abundance ) , @xmath67 km / s with @xmath68 being the star s speed relative to the ambient medium , @xmath69 being the sound speed in the ambient medium , and @xmath70 is a factor that accounts for the microphysics of the accretion process . if the accretion is adiabatic , @xmath71 ( bondi - hoyle accretion ) .",
    "if preheating of the incident flow is important , @xmath70 could be much less than unity ( shvartsman 1970 ; ostriker et al .",

    "in this case , accretion occurs in a quasi - spherical manner near the star ( i.e. , for @xmath77 alfvn radius [ see below ] ; cf . hunt 1971 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath78 also gives another distance constraint ; @xmath79 , with the upper limit corresponding to @xmath80 .",
    "for material to reach the surface of the rotating magnetized star , the star must have spun down sufficiently so that accreting material can overcome the centrifugal barrier ( cf . illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) . the neutron star s spin evolution",
    "is divided into three phases ( see , e.g. , blaes & madau 1993 ; lipunov , postnov , & prokhorov 1997 ) . in the first ( dipole )",
    "phase , the star is an active pulsar and spins down by magnetic dipole radiation ; @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the star s angular velocity .",
    "this phase ends when the ram pressure of the ambient material ( @xmath83 ) overcomes the pulsar wind pressure ( @xmath84 ) at @xmath85 so that matter can now enter the star s magnetosphere .",
    "this happens when the star s period @xmath86 . in this second ( propeller ) phase",
    ", material enters the corotating magnetosphere and is stopped at @xmath87 , the alfvnic radius , where the energy density in the accretion flow balances the local magnetic pressure .",
    "this radius is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 g-@xmath90 is the neutron star s magnetic moment .",
    "further penetration can not occur owing to the centrifugal barrier , that is , @xmath91 ( cf . illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) , where @xmath92 is the corotation radius .",
    "since the accretion is quasi - spherical , material falls in initially with negative total energy ( material is bound ) and roughly zero angular momentum .",
    "spin down in this phase occurs via propeller and magnetic dipole spin - down ; @xmath93 .",
    "if the infalling material cools efficiently and attaches itself to field lines at around @xmath94 , the star expels the material once it spins up the material to the local escape velocity at @xmath87 . by angular momentum conservation ,",
    "@xmath95 . if the material does not cool and/or thread the field lines efficiently , the hot gas will remain bound in a `` cocoon '' at @xmath87 . as the underlying magnetosphere rotates supersonically shearing through this `` cocoon , '' the consequent shock heating expels material from the star ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) . by energy conservation , @xmath96 , where the final expression is typical for a star just entering the propeller phase . in this limit",
    ", only a fraction of the energy given to escaping material goes into azimuthal motion , so @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is taken as a freely adjustable parameter .",
    "the exact value of @xmath100 requires time - dependent numerical simulations ( e.g. , wang & robertson 1985 ) . if @xmath101 , @xmath102 throughout this phase .",
    "propeller action continues until @xmath103 , when the centrifugal barrier is removed and polar cap accretion ensues ( e.g. , lamb et al .",
    "1973 ; davidson & ostriker 1973 ; arons & lea 1980 ) .",
    "this occurs when @xmath104 . in quasi - spherical accretion",
    ", no net _ torque _ is exerted on the star ( due to accretion ) .",
    "the mass loading of the field lines , however , now becomes important in spinning down the star by increasing the moment of inertia of the star + corotating magnetosphere system   ( see , e.g. , mestel 1990 for a discussion of this effect in normal stars ) .",
    "for @xmath105 , angular momentum conservation ( @xmath106 ) gives @xmath107 .",
    "( in the limit of a weakly magnetized star where @xmath108 , @xmath109 in the above expression and @xmath110 . )",
    "the total spin - down rate in this final ( accretion ) phase is then @xmath111 , although , quite generally , @xmath112 .",
    "for accretion to occur , we require @xmath103 , that is , @xmath113 . for pulsed emission ,",
    "that is , polar cap accretion , we require @xmath105 . combining these",
    ", the present day surface field must satisfy    @xmath114    this condition rules out the possibility of measuring the field directly through cyclotron ( emission ) line observations , which require @xmath115 ( nelson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "assume first that the star s field does not decay , that is , its initial field @xmath116 is the same as the current field and satisfies eqn ( [ bprop ] ) .",
    "we obtain an upper bound to the period @xmath117 by using @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) ;    @xmath119    if the star was born with @xmath120 , it must first dipole spin down to @xmath117 .",
    "this takes @xmath121 , where we have used @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) to arrive at the inequality .",
    "the star thus spends longer than a hubble time ( @xmath122 yrs ) just in the first ( dipole ) phase .",
    "if the star was born with @xmath123 , it goes directly to the second ( propeller ) phase .",
    "propeller spin down to @xmath124 takes @xmath125 , where we have used @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) , @xmath126 ( cf . eqn [ [ pinit ] ] ) , and @xmath127 to arrive at the inequality .",
    "the star thus spends longer than a hubble time in this phase .",
    "( if @xmath128 , magnetic dipole spin down will be important initially , but propeller spin down dominates eventually . )    we conclude that if the star was born with @xmath129 s , then to enable sufficient spin down to allow accretion onto the star , it _ must _ have been born with a stronger field than at present , that is , _ the stellar magnetic field must have decayed_.    of course , if the neutron star is born slowly rotating , i.e , with @xmath130 , then the star can spin down within a hubble time to 8.39 s without requiring magnetic field decay .",
    "however , it is unclear how neutron stars can form with such long initial spin periods _ and _ weak magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that rx j0720.4 - 3125 actually evolved from a high mass x - ray binary system ( cf .",
    "haberl et al .",
    "we argue here , however , that conventional isolated neutron star models can account quite well for the properties of rx j0720.4 - 3125 .    in general , the star s spin and magnetic field history is determined by @xmath131 , @xmath116 , the field decay law , and decay timescale @xmath132 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath131 , however , is very weak whenever @xmath127 , which is generally believed to be the case ( e.g. , narayan & ostriker 1990 ) .    in figure 1 , we illustrate sample evolutionary tracks in @xmath42-@xmath133 space for two magnetic field decay laws . for the solid curve , the stellar field is assumed to decay as a power law , i.e. , @xmath134 ( e.g. , narayan & ostriker 1990 ; sang & chanmugam 1987 ) , with @xmath135 yrs . for the dot - dashed curve ,",
    "exponential decay is assumed , i.e. , @xmath136 ( e.g. , ostriker & gunn 1969 ) , with @xmath137 yrs . to construct these tracks , an isolated neutron star with @xmath138 and @xmath139 km is assumed to be born with @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and is assumed to be moving at 20 km / s through a medium with @xmath142 @xmath36 and @xmath143 km / s .",
    "spin down spans the magnetic dipole , propeller , and accretion phases . for the propeller spin down rate",
    ", we took @xmath144 and for the accretion rate , we took @xmath145 .",
    "in the power law decay model , the star enters the accretion phase at @xmath146 yrs and spins down to 8.39 s in @xmath147 yrs . for the exponential decay model ,",
    "these numbers are @xmath148 yrs and @xmath149 yrs , respectively .    for @xmath150 , we find @xmath151 yrs for power law decay models ( cf .",
    "urpin et al .",
    "1994 ) , while @xmath152 yrs for exponential decay models .",
    "these results are consistent with several recent analyses of pulsar statistics and field decay ( e.g. , wakatsuki et al .",
    "1992 ; bhattacharya et al .",
    "1992 ; lamb 1992 ; urpin et al . 1994 ; verbunt 1994 ) , and with the analysis assuming power law decay in narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "for @xmath153 , the star can not enter the accretion phase within a hubble time even for the most favorable case of a stationary ( @xmath80 ) star . if @xmath154 , the star will not be able to enter the accretion phase _ and _ spin down to 8.39 s in a hubble time unless @xmath155 km / s ( cf .",
    "blaes & madau 1993 ) .    from @xmath156 and @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) , we obtain an upper bound to the current spin down rate ;    @xmath157    in both models shown in figure 1 , the 8.39 s period is reached shortly after the star enters the accretion phase , and @xmath158 .",
    "it is evident from figure 1 that @xmath133 in the exponential decay model asymptotes after entering the accretion phase while @xmath133 for the power law decay model continues to increase monotonically .",
    "this is because in exponential decay models , the field , and hence @xmath94 ( lever arm ) decreases more rapidly at late times , whereas the field in power law decay models persists longer .",
    "if neutron star fields undergo exponential decay and the 8.39 s period in rx j0720.4 - 3125 is the star s asymptotic period , then we expect @xmath159 s@xmath7s@xmath8 .",
    "we have so far assumed that the stellar magnetic field decays indefinitely .",
    "we emphasize , however , that once the stellar field has decayed sufficiently to enable accretion ( cf .",
    "eqn [ 2 ] ) , no further decay is required by the observations .",
    "thus , for instance , the decaying field may level out at late times to a steady finite long - lived value ( e.g. , kulkarni 1986 ; romani 1990 ) .",
    "we argue in this paper that rx j0720.4 - 3125 is an old isolated neutron star , situated at @xmath38 pc , that has spun down long past the active pulsar stage and is now accreting matter from the interstellar medium . unless the star was born with an unusually long period ( @xmath160 s ; cf .",
    "eqn [ [ pinit ] ] ) _ and _ weak magnetic field ( @xmath161 ; cf .",
    "eqn [ [ bprop ] ] ) , such spin down is only possible if the star s field at birth was much stronger than at present , that is , the star s field _ must _ have decayed .",
    "our analysis gives long decay timescales ; @xmath4 yrs for power law decay and @xmath5 yrs for exponential decay , assuming @xmath3 .",
    "a @xmath6 s@xmath7s@xmath8 would be consistent with an old accreting isolated neutron star .",

    "shvartsman 1971 ; blaes & madau 1993 ; blaes et al .",
    "this low surface brightness nebula should be dominated by @xmath163 in a compact inner zone ( @xmath164 cm ; e.g. , blaes et al . 1995 ) and be rich in mid to far infrared metal forbidden lines ( e.g. , [ neii]12.8@xmath165 , [ siii]35@xmath165 ) in an extended outer zone ( @xmath166 cm ) . the results of deep spectroscopy can therefore be used as an additional test of the model presented here .",
