    "traditional schemes such as upwind , riemann solver , approximate riemann solver , random choice method , artificial viscosity , are usually of low order in nature .",
    "more sophisticated approaches , such as total variation diminishing ( tvd ) , essentially non - oscillatory ( eno)@xcite , weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) , characteristic - based - split ( cbs)@xcite and discontinuous galerkin schemes@xcite are proposed in the past two decades .",
    "generally , these shock - capturing schemes are shown to be very successful in many applications .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out@xcite that the use of a sixth order accurate eno scheme in the entire computational domain leads to a significant damping of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "garnier et al@xcite found that in the framework of freely decaying turbulence , the numerical dissipation of high - order accurate shock - capturing schemes masks the effect of the subgrid - scale model .",

    "these eno filters are shown to effectively improve the resolution of density waves , entropy waves and stochastic turbulent fluctuations .",
    "indeed , in the case of direct simulation of turbulence , typical successful numerical approaches are spectral methods for their capability of resolving multiscale features in turbulent fluctuations",

    "conjugate filters are constructed by using dsc kernels and are optimal in the sense that they have similar order of regularity , accuracy , frequency bandwidth and computational supports .",
    "the cfor scheme has been successfully applied to shock - capturing in association with burgers equation , one- and two - dimensional ( 2d ) euler systems including the sod and lax problems , and the mach 3 flow past a wind tunnel with a step .",

    "the objective of the present work is to explore the utility and limitation of the cfor scheme in dealing with the problem of shock - high frequency entropy wave interaction , which is very challenging because conventional methods encounter the difficulty of either insufficient accuracy or excessive numerical damping .",
    "it is believed that a better understanding of the cfor scheme is of importance to the development of high - accuracy and low - dissipation schemes for the numerical solution of more challenging problems , such as shock - turbulence interaction .",

    "singular convolutions occur commonly in science and engineering .",
    "discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) is an effective approach for the numerical realization of singular convolutions .",
    "there are many detailed descriptions about the discrete singular convolution in the literature@xcite .",
    "the introduction in ref .",
    "@xcite is recommended for its theoretical underpinning and approximation philosophy . for the sake of integrity and convenience , a brief review of the dsc algorithm",
    "is given before describing the cfor scheme .",
    "in the context of distribution theory , a singular convolution can be defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a singular kernel and @xmath2 is an element of the space of test functions .",
    "interesting examples include singular kernels of hilbert ( and abel ) type and delta type .",
    "the former plays an important role in the theory of analytical functions , processing of analytical signals , theory of linear responses and radon transform . since delta type kernels are the key element in the theory of approximation and the numerical solution of differential equations , we focus on the singular kernels of delta type @xmath3 where superscript @xmath4 denotes the @xmath5th - order `` derivative '' of the delta distribution , @xmath6 , with respect to @xmath7 , which should be understood as generalized derivatives of distributions . when @xmath8 , the kernel , @xmath9 , is important for the interpolation of surfaces and curves , including applications to the design of engineering structures .",
    "for hyperbolic conservation law and euler systems , two special cases , @xmath8 and @xmath10 are involved , whereas for the full navier - stokes equations , the case of @xmath11 will be also invoked . because of its singular nature , the singular convolution of eq .",
    "( [ dsc1 ] ) can not be directly used for numerical computations .",
    "in addition , the restriction to the test function is too strict for most practical applications . to avoid the difficulty of using singular expressions directly in numerical computations , we consider a discrete singular convolution which provides appropriate approximations to the original distribution @xmath12 where @xmath13 are approximations to @xmath14 and are designed for being used in ( discrete ) summations . here",
    ", @xmath15 is an appropriate set of discrete points centered around the point @xmath7 and @xmath16 is the grid spacing .",
    "depending on the mathematical properties of the kernel , @xmath17 , the restriction on the @xmath18 can be relaxed to include many common - occurring functions .",
    "a variety of candidates are available for @xmath17 in the literature . in these examples ,",
    "shannon s delta kernel is of particularly interesting @xmath19 shannon s kernel is a delta sequence and thus provides an approximation to the delta distribution @xmath20 shannon s kernel has been widely used in information theory , signal and image processing because the fourier transform of shannon s kernel is an ideal low - pass filter .",
    "however , the use of shannon s kernel is limited by the fact that it has a slow - decaying oscillatory tail proportional to @xmath21 in the coordinate domain . for signal processing ,",
    "shannon s kernel is an infinite impulse response ( iir ) low - pass filter .",
    "therefore , when truncated in computational applications , its fourier transform contains evident oscillations . a cure to this problem is to regularize shannon s kernel with a gaussian @xmath22 since @xmath23 is a schwarz class function , it makes the regularized shannon s kernel applicable to tempered distributions .",
    "moreover , as the regularized kernels decay very fast in the space domain , they can be utilized as finite impulse response ( fir ) low - pass filters .",
    "their oscillation in the fourier domain is dramatically reduced and effectively controlled .    for sequences of the delta type , an interpolating algorithm sampling at the nyquist frequency , @xmath24 ,",
    "has an advantage over a non - interpolating discretization .",
    "therefore , on a uniform grid , the regularized shannon s kernel is discretized as @xmath25 the regularized kernel @xmath26 corresponds to a family of fir low - pass filters , each with a different compact support , according to @xmath27 , in the coordinate domain .",
    "its @xmath5th order derivative is given by analytical differentiation @xmath28 in this work , @xmath29 are referred as a family of  conjugate filters \" , as they are derived from one generating function and consequently have similar degree of regularity , smoothness , time - frequency localization , effective support and bandwidth .    in application , optimal results are usually obtained if the window size @xmath30 varies as a function of the central frequency @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 is a parameter chosen in computations .",

    "no additional effort is required if the problem under consideration does not involve discontinuity .",
    "otherwise , an additional filtering can be implemented to prevent spurious oscillations .",
    "as aforementioned , the conjugate filters are constructed from the same generating function ( [ sdelta ] ) .",
    "the frequency responses of conjugate low - pass and high - pass filters are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dscdft ] .",
    "it can be seen that below @xmath57 , all the conjugate filters are highly accurate . however , in the high - frequency region , the frequency responses of both the low - pass filter and first - order high - pass filter are serious under estimating , whereas the frequency response of the second - order high - pass filter is over estimating .",
    "the error in the high - frequency response is harmless for numerical problems involving only low frequency components .",
    "however , in the case of shock and discontinuity , the solution contains much high - frequency component , the error in the high - frequency response will be accumulated and amplified during the time integration , and leads to spurious oscillations .",
    "this observation motivates us to use the conjugate low - pass filter to appropriately eliminate most of the high frequency response produced by the conjugate high - pass filters . as a result , the solution generated by conjugate filters is reliable for the frequency below the effective bandwidth of the filters . the effective bandwidth or frequency",
    "cut - off is controlled by the choice of the dsc parameter @xmath58 , for a given @xmath16 .",
    "the cfor scheme is implemented via the following two - step procedure @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the high - pass filtering process given by @xmath61 $ ] , i.e. , the intermediate result obtained by using the scheme ( [ basic ] ) . here , @xmath62 is the dsc low - pass filtering as shown in eq .",

    "there are a number of such sensors which can be used in the present scheme . among them",

    "two experiments are performed in this study .",
    "one is to examine the accuracy of the cfor scheme and to compare with the available literature .",
    "the other is to investigate the stability and performance of the cfor scheme for long - time integration . for the first experiment",

    "highly accurate results are obtained , as shown by the tables .",
    "obviously , the proposed scheme is much more accurate than any other scheme listed in the tables , which are reported by garnier et al@xcite .",
    "remarkably , the cfor scheme is from 4 to 5 orders more accurate than other schemes when @xmath103 .",
    "as the spatial discretization of the cfor scheme is extremely accurate , some of the present results computed at cfl=0.5 might be limited by the cfl number , which was optimized according to various schemes given in ref .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the cfor results computed at cfl=0.01 are generally more accurate than those obtained at cfl=0.5 as shown in tables [ vortextable1 ] and [ vortextable2 ] .",
    "note that the accuracy of the cfor scheme increases dramatically when the mesh is refined from 40 grid points to 80 grid points , with the numerically computed approximation order being more than 15 .",
    "therefore , the cfor scheme has the feature of spectral - like methods .",
    "obvious , due to its extremely high accuracy , the cfor can be used for large scale simulations without resorting to a very large mesh as required by low order schemes .",
    "our second numerical experiment concerns the performance of the cfor scheme for the long - time integration , which poses a severe challenge to the stability and conservation of the discretization scheme@xcite .",
    "the solution of @xmath91 is sampled at @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with the grid spacing of @xmath106 and cfl=0.5 . in fig .",
    "[ vortexfig1 ] , we show the horizontal line cut through the center of the vortex for density @xmath91 . obviously , there is no visual deviation between the computed result and exact result .",
    "errors listed in table [ vortextable3 ] further confirm that the present scheme is extreme accuracy , free of excessive dissipation and reliable .",
    "since there is no presence of shock in this case , the low - pass filter originally designed to suppress dispersive wiggles might appear useless . in this experiment , it is found that the dsc algorithm on its own can already provide excellent results if the integration time is small enough .",
    "thus , the conjugate low - pass filter does not need to be activated during an initial time period .",
    "however , as the time progresses , errors would accumulate rapidly and the computation could become unstable if the low - pass filter were not used to effectively control the dramatical nonlinear growth of the errors .",
    "therefore , the cfor scheme is very robust for the treatment of this problem .",
    "as shown in table [ vortextable3 ] and fig .",
    "[ vortexfig1 ] ( @xmath107 ) , the long time simulation results are very stable .",
    "the vortex core is well conserved and the accuracy is extremely high .",
    "these results indicate that the cfor scheme is highly accurate , stable and conservative for the long - time integration of euler systems .",
    "it is a potential approach for the numerical integration of hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "its ability for shock - capturing is examined in the next subsection .",
    "the interaction of shock and high frequency entropy wave is a standard test problem for benchmarking potential high - order shock - capturing methods .",
    "the problem is significant due to its relevant to the interaction of shock - turbulence .",

    "we vary the wave number of the pre - shock entropy wave while keep its amplitude unchanged . as a results",
    ", the amplitude of the post - shock entropy wave will also be a constant , i.e. 0.08690716 and the corresponding amplitude of pre - shock entropy wave is @xmath110=0.01 .    in this problem ,",
    "a large - amplitude high - frequency entropy wave is mixed with spurious oscillations .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish them clearly in numerical simulations .",
    "potential methods designed for suppressing the spurious oscillation might also smear the high - frequency post - shock entropy wave . as the wave number @xmath111 increases",
    ", the problem becomes extremely challenging@xcite .",
    "low - order shock - capturing schemes and even some popular high - order schemes encounter the difficulty in preserving the amplitude of the entropy wave due to excessive dissipation with a given mesh size . therefore , a success shock capturing method should be able to eliminate gibbs oscillation , capture the shock and preserve the entropy wave .",
    "the computational domain is deployed with 800 grid points , and such a mesh is used in all the numerical tests except for further specified .",
    "first , we consider the case of @xmath111=13 .",
    "this is a good test case for a basic scheme as there are 20 grid points per entropy wavelength , which is sufficient for describing the wave if there is no shock .",
    "such a case was found being slightly difficult for the fifth order weno scheme@xcite .",
    "a significant amplitude damping occurs and the mesh of @xmath112 has to be used to maintain the amplitude of the entropy wave@xcite .",
    "the result of the cfor scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](a ) .",
    "it is seen that the generated entropy wave spans fully over the strip bounded by two solid lines , showing excellent agreement with the linear analysis .",
    "the shock is exactly captured with a small frequency mismatch locates at the shock front .",
    "such mismatch also occurs to the eno and weno schemes@xcite due to nature of discontinuity .",
    "the performance of the cfor scheme is really remarkable for this case .",
    "next , we double the wave number , i.e. @xmath111=26 . the number of supporting grid points per generated entropy wavelength is 10 .",
    "it is a quite difficult case for low - order shock - capturing schemes and no available result is reported in the literature , to our knowledge .",
    "the cfor result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](b ) .",
    "obviously , the compressed entropy wave is excellently resolved in the post - shock regime .",
    "there is no visible trace of excessive dissipation as the amplitude of the entropy wave reaches its full strength in the whole post - shock regime .",
    "as expected , the frequency mismatch near the shock front becomes more obvious because there is an enlarged difference in the wave frequencies before and after the shock .",
    "we further increase the wave number @xmath111 to 39 and plot the cfor result in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](c ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the compressed entropy wave peaks span to it full amplitude for only about half of its extrema over the post - shock regime .",
    "analysis indicates that the presence of the under developed peaks is not due to excessive dissipation .",
    "instead , it is due to the insufficient resolution in the plot . with a total of 800 grid points in the domain ,",
    "there is less than 7 grid points per wavelength .",
    "such a grid is not large enough to fully resolve all the extrema in the compressed entropy wave .",
    "this explains the suppressed extrema in the plot .",
    "obviously , it is extremely difficult to capture shock on such a grid for any potential scheme .",
    "however , the cfor scheme performs extremely well as shown in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](d ) , which is obtained by interpolating the cfor result in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](c ) to a denser grid @xmath113 .",
    "the interpolation is carried out by using the dsc interpolation scheme , i.e. , the conjugate low - pass filter as given in eq .",
    "( [ fdsc1 ] ) with @xmath8 . apparently , the quality of this result is comparable with the case of @xmath111=26 .",
    "this confirms that the cfor scheme works well for shock - capturing under a very small ratio of grid points and wavelength .",
    "finally , we consider two large wave numbers , @xmath114 and 65 , to further test the performance of the cfor scheme .",
    "a mesh of 800 grid points means a ratio of less than 5 grid points per wavelength , which is too few for simultaneous shock capturing and high - frequency wave resolving .",
    "the cfor scheme generates some small amplitude damping for @xmath114 ( which is not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we increase the mesh size to @xmath115 for these computations . with this mesh , there are 10 grid points in each generated wavelength for @xmath114 .",
    "the resolution in the post - shock regime is excellent as shown in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](e ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ shockfig1](f ) , results for @xmath116 are also very good .",
    "however , there is a visible amplitude damping in the generated entropy waves .",
    "we noticed that the conjugate low - pass filter is activated more often in this computation than in previous cases . with the increase of wave number @xmath111 , the @xmath79",
    "should also be increased to broaden the effective bandwidth so that high - frequency wave shall not suffer from too much numerical damping . obviously , the present scheme is capable of distinguishing the spurious oscillations from the high frequency oscillation of the entropy wave , so as to attain high resolution for normal physical properties and capture the shock .",
    "it is believed that the potential of proposed cfor scheme has been sufficiently demonstrated by these experiments .",
    "the potential utility of a newly developed conjugate filter oscillation reduction ( cfor ) scheme@xcite for the treatment of shock and high - frequency wave interaction is explored .",
    "the cfor scheme is constructed based on the discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) algorithm , which is a practical approach for the numerical realization of singular convolutions .",
    "the essential idea of the cfor scheme is to employ a conjugate low - pass filter to effectively remove the high - frequency errors ( spurious oscillations ) created by a set of high - pass filters , which are employed to discretize the spatial derivatives in the hyperbolic conservation laws or partial differential equations .",
    "the conjugate low - pass and high - pass filters are optimal for shock - capturing and spurious oscillation suppressing in the sense that they are generated from the same expression and consequently have similar order of regularity and approximation , effective frequency band and compact support .    the separation of the basic spatial discretization ( the high - pass filtering ) and the post - processing ( low - pass filtering ) in the proposed shock - capturing scheme makes it possible to focus on the design of a set of versatile and efficient filters .",
    "such an approach has a few advantages .",
    "first , the basic dsc algorithm is a local method but it can be as accurate as a spectral method . therefore , the cfor scheme has controllable accuracy via the choice of filter parameters . secondly , the post - processing applies at most once per iteration circle , comparing with pointwise treatment at each grid point in many other schemes .",
    "therefore , there is a potential increase in the computational efficiency by a mature cfor code .",
    "finally , the implementation of the conjugate low - pass filter and filter parameters are easily controlled .",
    "hence , physical high frequency can be effectively distinguished from the shock induced spurious oscillations in the present approach .",
    "the performance of the proposed scheme is examined by using two benchmark euler systems , the free evolution of a 2d isentropic vortex@xcite and the interaction of shock - entropy wave@xcite .",

    "the cfor scheme provides higher - order accuracy for solving the problem and its performance is compared with many other schemes in the literature@xcite .",
    "the system of shock - entropy wave interaction is a difficult case due to its natural high frequency oscillations in the compressed entropy wave , which is easily damped by the excessive numerical dissipation in most existing shock - capturing schemes .",
    "the problem becomes a severe challenge as the wave frequency increases .",
