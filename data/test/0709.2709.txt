    "quantum chromodynamics is a perturbative field theory for @xmath10 , corresponding to energies above @xmath11 mev .",
    "however , setting up a good perturbation expansion is more difficult than simply working order by order in @xmath12 .",
    "the difficulty is that when computing a quantity with more than one scale , logarithms of ratios of those scales appear which invalidate the naive perturbation expansion .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath4 , we might look for the distribution of jets as a function of the invariant mass @xmath13 of the jet .",
    "then the differential cross section will have a correction of the form @xmath14 .",
    "even for @xmath10 these large logarithms can dominate if @xmath13 is sufficiently small .",
    "luckily , these logarithms appear only in certain combinations even at higher order , so that all the terms of the form @xmath15 can be ( re)summed at once .",
    "however , understanding which terms will appear , how to resum them , and how to combine the resummed result with fixed order results can be quite complicated .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to show how it can be done using effective field theory techniques .    in this paper , resummation and matching of event shapes",
    "are studied using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "event shapes are observables which are sensitive to the overall distribution of final state particles , and therefore involve both short and long distance physics .",
    "we will consider mainly the event shape @xmath16 where the thrust @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 summing over all momentum @xmath19-vectors @xmath20 in the event and maximizing over unit 3-vectors @xmath21 . in the threshold region near @xmath22 large logarithms of the form @xmath23 appear at fixed order in perturbation theory .",
    "the resummed result will be valid even if @xmath23 is large , as long as @xmath12 and @xmath24 are small .",
    "effective field theories provide a systematic approach to resummation .",
    "they separate out physics at a hard underlying scale @xmath4 from physics associated with a scale of interest @xmath25 and from even lower scales . at each scale",
    "a separate matching calculation is done which is independent of physics at asymptotically lower or higher energy .",
    "then the scale dependence is calculated using the renormalization group . in this way",
    ", large logarithms can not appear because no two largely separated scales are accessible to the theory at the same time .",
    "the soft - collinear effective theory works by separating the degrees of freedom of qcd into soft modes and collinear modes in different directions .",
    "the relevant scales are then associated with the observable of interest , such as @xmath26 , or with the large components of the collinear modes .",
    "the resummation of event shapes in @xmath0 is not currently of extreme importance phenomenologically .",
    "it nevertheless provides a clean arena ( as compared to hadron collisions ) to explore resummation and matching .",
    "the scet techniques and most of the formulas we discuss here were originally developed for @xmath27-physics , such as resummation in @xmath28 decays  @xcite .",
    "they have also been applied to the study of deep - inelastic - scattering near @xmath29  @xcite and to the production of massive jets initiated by top quark decays  @xcite .",
    "one convenient feature of effective field theories is factorization , which allows us to use objects , such as soft and jet functions , calculated in one process to study another .",
    "thus , most of the hard work required for calculation of the distributions we describe here can be extracted from the literature .",
    "nevertheless , there are certain features , in particular the nlo matching step , for which event shapes are uniquely illuminating .",
    "the breakdown of naive perturbation theory due to the appearance of large logarithms is independent of @xmath12 blowing up and of non - perturbative effects . to emphasize this point , and to simplify the resummed expressions , the running of @xmath12",
    "will be simply turned off ( setting @xmath30 ) for most of this paper . working in the conformal limit",
    "removes one scale ( @xmath31 ) from the problem and thus clarifies which large logs are being resummed .",
    "it is not hard to turn @xmath32 back on , as will be shown in section  [ sec : gen ] .",
    "also , we will be including all one - loop results but no two - loop results .",
    "thus , our expressions will not contain a complete next - to - leading log resummation , which should also resum the two - loop double logs .",
    "there are three steps involved in the calculation of event shapes in scet , associated with three separate scales . at the hard scale @xmath33 ,",
    "qcd is matched onto scet by demanding parton level matrix elements in the two theories be the same .",
    "this can be done at leading order by matching onto an operator @xmath34 with two collinear fields , or at next - to - leading order by matching in addition to an operator @xmath35 with collinear fields in three directions  @xcite .",
    "the threshold resummation only involves @xmath34 as the matrix elements of @xmath35 vanish near @xmath36 .",
    "( an alternative approach to @xmath37 matching is described in  @xcite ) . at the scale @xmath38 , the collinear fields freeze and",
    "can be removed from the theory by integrating them out .",
    "this results in the a jet function @xmath39 .",
    "finally , even though we are interested in a distribution at the scale @xmath40 , the soft degrees of freedom remain relevant down to a scale @xmath41 , after which they too can be integrated out of the theory .",
    "the fixed order result will have large logarithms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but in the resummed result all these logs are exponentiated and innocuous .",
    "before we present the factorization formula and calculate the thrust distribution in scet , we will review the way resummation of thrust is traditionally handled .",
    "there are a number of ways to resum event shapes  @xcite .",
    "since the focus of this work is on comparisons to scet , we will confine our attention to the original approach of catani , trentadue , turnock and webber  @xcite , which will be referred to as cttw throughout .",
    "moreover , most of the other approaches reduce to  @xcite at next - to - leading fixed order in @xmath12 ( nlo ) and to leading log , so no significant loss of generality is sustained .",
    "we will find that in the two - jet limit scet also agrees with cttw to the order we are working , although the resummed expressions are not exactly the same .",
    "a more significant difference is in the nlo matching .",
    "a critical advantage of the effective theory approach is that the finite parts of loop amplitudes are automatically incorporated into the perturbative expressions .",
    "for example , the total nlo cross section for @xmath0 is reproduced by combining the finite parts of the hard , jet , and soft functions and a contribution from a finite integral over higher - order operators in scet .",
    "this does not necessarily entail less work than in calculating the total cross section through the traditional combination of real and virtual contributions .",
    "however , due to factorization , the infrared divergent contributions which are absorbed into the jet and soft functions are universal and thus the could potentially be used for many processes .",
    "in this section , we will review some basic results from qcd on thrust , and the resummed expressions presented in  @xcite .    to begin , consider the parton model description of @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "at order @xmath44 , the only process which contributes is @xmath45 .",
    "these two jets have no structure and hence the cross section is simply @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is leading order total @xmath48 annihilation cross section .    at order",
    "@xmath49 , there are two @xmath50 diagrams which contribute @xmath51 where the photon line on the bottom is the @xmath52 current coming in . the differential cross section is @xmath53_{\\mathrm{parton } } = \\delta ( { s } )    \\delta ( t ) + { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\frac{{s}^2 + { t}^2 + 2 { u}}{{s}\\,{t } }   \\label{sigparton}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath54 and the reduced mandlestam variables are @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "now , for 3-parton events the thrust variable @xmath58 reduces to @xmath59 so that @xmath60_{\\mathrm{parton } } & = & \\delta ( \\tau ) +    { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\left [ \\frac{2 ( 3 \\tau^2 - 3 \\tau + 2)}{\\tau ( 1 - \\tau ) } \\log    \\frac{1 - 2\\tau}{\\tau } - \\frac{3 ( 1 - 3 \\tau ) ( 1 + \\tau)}{\\tau } \\right]\\\\    & = & \\delta ( \\tau ) + { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\left [ \\frac{- 4 \\log \\tau - 3}{\\tau } \\right ] +    { \\bar{\\alpha}}d_{\\mathrm{fin } } ( \\tau ) .",
    "\\label{partondc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second line is written to manifest the singularity structure .",
    "the remainder @xmath61 is finite as @xmath62 .    instead of the differential thrust distribution , it is useful to work directly with the integrated quantity @xmath63 for small @xmath64 , @xmath65 here we see explicitly the large logarithms @xmath23 and @xmath66 which demand resummation .",
    "a useful theoretical trick , used in  @xcite and in  @xcite , is to employ a hemisphere mass definition .",
    "this greatly simplifies the factorization formula in the two - jet limit . the hemisphere momentum @xmath67 is defined to be the sum of the 4-momenta of all the particles in the hemisphere of the left ( right ) jet .",
    "then thrust reduces to @xmath68 , and we can calculate it from @xmath69 which we will see has a closed form expression .",
    "the traditional approach to resummation which we review here is due to catani et al .",
    "the basic idea is that terms of the form @xmath70 come from multiple real collinear and soft emissions .",
    "the kinematics of multiple collinear emissions can be modeled by parton branchings , with branching probabilities proportional to the altarelli - parisi splitting functions @xmath71 in the two - jet limit , the corrections due to soft effects can be modeled by imposing angular ordering .",
    "all of this follows from the coherent - branching algorithm developed in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , more general methods are available for handling soft emissions ( for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "but , to nlo for event shapes like thrust , the methods set up in  @xcite are sufficient to compare to scet .    in the two - jet limit , the factorized expression for the differential cross section in cttw is @xmath72_\\mathrm{cttw } = { j_{\\mathrm c } } ( q^2 , p_l^2 ) { j_{\\mathrm c } } ( q^2 , p_r^2 ) .",

    "@xmath74 has a simple physical interpretation : it is the probability of finding a final state jet with invariant mass @xmath13 .",
    "thus , it satisfies @xmath75 @xmath4 is a scale associated with the hard process .",
    "we will see later that the equivalent jet function in scet has a different normalization .    at leading order the jet is a massless parton and so @xmath76 . at next - to - leading order ,",
    "the coherent branching algorithm allows one - angular ordered emission .",
    "so @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the energy fraction in the emission and @xmath79 .",
    "the angular ordering constraint for the coherence of soft emissions is implicit in the restriction @xmath80 ; for @xmath81 it cuts off the infrared divergences in the integral as @xmath82 .",

    "the leading order resummation is preformed by iterating the angular - ordered emissions .",
    "this leads to an integro - differential equation for @xmath93 , similar to the evolution equation for parton - distribution functions .",
    "the equation is solved in an integrated form , and the resummed expression for the integrated thrust in the two jet limit is @xmath94_\\mathrm{cttw } = \\exp \\left [ - 2 { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\log^2 \\tau - 3{\\bar{\\alpha}}\\log \\tau   \\right ]   \\frac{e^{- 2 \\gamma_e \\eta}}{\\gamma [ 2 \\eta+1 ] } ,   \\label{qcdresum}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 this equation is a combination of expressions in  @xcite taken with @xmath30 .",

    "having reviewed the way the resummed thrust distribution is traditionally calculated , we now turn to the equivalent calculation in scet .",
    "we will see that there are a number of advantages of this effective field theory treatment . instead of a classical treatment , where multiple real emissions are summed at the level of the cross section",
    ", the entire resummation is done in scet through the renormalization group .",
    "this makes explicit the various scales in the problem , and allows greater freedom to choose those scales to minimize the large logarithms in the distributions of interest .",
    "the idea behind scet is to separate out the quarks and gluons of qcd into soft and collinear degrees of freedom .",
    "a collinear field is associated with a light - like direction @xmath99 .",
    "the component of its momentum in that direction , @xmath100 , must be much larger than any of the other momentum components .",
    "all the qcd degrees of freedom which could change this momentum have been integrated out , so @xmath101 appears as a fixed label .",
    "for example , a collinear quark is written as @xmath102 with a fixed @xmath101 .",
    "in addition to collinear quarks and gluons , there are soft quarks and gluons .",
    "these soft fields can only interact with each other or transfer momentum to the soft components @xmath103 of a collinear field .",
    "the lagrangian of scet has a separate gauge invariance associated with soft gluons and gluons in each collinear direction .",
    "it is useful to maintain this gauge invariance explicitly in the operators of the theory with the use of wilson lines .",
    "for example , a two - jet operator is @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 the collinear wilson lines @xmath107 maintain collinear gauge invariance and the soft wilson lines @xmath108 maintain soft gauge invariance .",

    "then , we can evolve either the jet function from @xmath191 down to @xmath173 or the soft function from @xmath173 up to @xmath191 but there is not a single scale which can minimize all the large logs .    finally , to evaluate the convolution for the thrust integral , we use the laplace transform of the @xmath192-function @xmath193 combining this with the expression for @xmath194 above , the scet prediction for thrust in the 2-jet limit is @xmath94_\\mathrm{scet }   = |c_h ( \\mu_h ) |^2 \\exp \\left [ 2 { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\log^2    \\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_j^2 } + 3 { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\log \\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_j^2 } - { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\log^2 \\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_s^2 } \\right ] \\left ( \\frac{q \\mu_s}{\\mu_j^2 }    \\right)^{- 4 { \\bar{\\alpha}}\\log \\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_s^2 } } \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath195 ^ 2 \\left (    \\frac{q^2 \\tau}{\\mu_j^2 } \\right)^{2 \\eta_k } \\frac{e^{- 2 \\gamma_e    \\eta_k}}{\\gamma [ 2 \\eta_k + 1 ] } .\\ ] ] note that this expression is explicitly independent of @xmath87 .",

    "this expression would be identical to the cttw expression , eq .",
    ", if @xmath201 .",
    "recall that the function @xmath202 comes from 1-loop matching in scet , which turns into boundary conditions for the renormalization group evolution . in the approach of cttw",
    "the boundary condition is simply that @xmath203 . nevertheless , the effect of @xmath204 to order @xmath12 is only to provide a finite constant , as can been seen from comparing equations   and",
    "that is , there is no contribution of order @xmath205 in the difference , only of order @xmath206 and higher . beyond order @xmath12 ,",
    "the @xmath207 does change the @xmath205 dependence .",

    "must be be determined by a independent calculation of the total rate .",

    "there is arbitrariness in the matching because the hard emissions ( in @xmath219 ) are fixed order but the two - jet contribution is resummed .",
    "for example , to the same accuracy @xmath220 could be multiplied by the exponential .",
    "now , let us turn to the matching in scet . to include thrust distributions away from the endpoint , we can either attempt to add power corrections to scet , or we can match to higher order operators as described in  @xcite . matching is much simpler . to perform the matching , we add new operators @xmath221 where the @xmath222 are the additional terms coming from wilson lines necessary for gauge invariance .",

    "at this point , one would hope to compare to data .",
    "however , besides the obvious shortcoming of not containing the full nll resummation ( it does not include effects of the two - loop cusp anomalous dimension ) , this parton - level expression does not include important non - perturbative effects .",

    "the same function @xmath267 appears for jet mass and for thrust because to order @xmath12 in the parton model , @xmath268 .",
    "we have investigated how to combine resummation with next - to - leading order matching of event shapes in the original approach of  @xcite ( cttw ) and using scet . in the cttw formulation ,",
    "real emissions from collinear splitting functions are used and various kinematical features associated with soft emission are combined to derive a differential cross section .",
    "the cross section factorizes into the product of two jet functions .",
    "resummation is done by solving a differential equation for the jet functions in terms of the physical scales @xmath13 and @xmath269 of the event .",
    "in contrast , scet factorizes the event shape distribution into a contribution from hard , jet , and soft functions .",
    "these functions are matched at the scales @xmath196 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 respectively and resummation is done through renormalization group evolution .",
    "the resummed thrust distribution in scet and cttw have been compared , and found to agree to next - to - leading order in @xmath12 and for leading - log resummation .",
    "the resummation of thrust in scet brings to light a number of features of the process not obvious in cttw formulation .",
    "for example , the appearance of the seesaw scale @xmath272 as the natural matching scale for the soft function follows from the kinematics of the scet factorization theorem .",
    "of course , the existence of this scale has been known for a long time from qcd , but in the effective field theory approach this scale just drops out of the factorized expression .",
    "thus , for more complicated processes , it is reasonable to expect a similar transparency for the matching scales , which may facilitate subleading log resummation .",
    "in fact , two - loop , three - loop , and some four - loop anomalous dimensions for various quantities are already available  @xcite , and so subleading log resummation appears quite feasible . the biggest impediment to using these more accurate resummed results in a comparison to data",
    "is that power corrections of order @xmath260 have an important quantitative effect on event shapes .",
    "however , these corrections should modify only the soft function while higher order resummed expressions for the the hard and jet functions will remain valid .",
    "thus , the effective theory should be able to weave together the perturbative and non - perturbative calculations .",
    "a new result of this paper is the demonstration that inclusive quantities , such as the total cross section for @xmath0 can be calculated in a new way using scet . instead of taking the full differential @xmath159 + 1 body cross section and combining with the one - loop @xmath159-body cross section",
    ", scet combines finite parts of loops of soft and jet functions with a hard matching calculation and a finite integral over hard emissions .",
    "the soft and jet functions depend on the infrared regulator , but their convolution , and the hard function , do not . for @xmath0 annihilation at nlo",
    ", this may not be so impressive , but the procedure promises to apply to more complicated processes , perhaps even some for which nlo results are not available .",
    "it would also be very interesting to explore this mechanism at nnlo or to work with hadronic processes where the singularity structure is more complicated .",
