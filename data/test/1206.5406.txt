    ", several slices can be acquired to cover the heart in 3d and at a collection of discrete time samples over the cardiac cycle . from these partial observations ,",
    "the challenge is to extract the heart s dynamics from these input spatio - temporal data throughout the cardiac cycle @xcite , @xcite .",
    "image registration consists in estimating a transformation which insures the warping of one reference image onto another target image ( supposed to present some similarity ) .",
    "continuous transformations are privileged , the sequence of transformations during the estimation process is usually not much considered .",
    "most important is the final resulting transformation and not the way one image will be transformed to the other . here",
    ", we consider a reasonable interpolation process to continuously map the image intensity functions between two images in the context of cardiac motion estimation and modeling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present , in the context of optical flow , an algorithm to compute a time dependent transportation plan without using lagrangian techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction is ended , by recalling the optical flow model ( of ) . in section [ algo ] ,",
    "the algorithm is presented , and its convergence is discussed . in section [ masse ] it is shown that the solutions obtained with the proposed algorithm are the solutions minimizing the same energy than the time dependent optimal mass transportation problem .",
    "section [ exemples ] is devoted to numerical results .",
    "in particular a 2d cardiac medical image is considered .",
    "let @xmath4 be the intensity function , and @xmath5 be the velocity of the apparent motion of brightness pattern .",
    "an image sequence is considered via the gray - value map @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a bounded regular domain , the support of images , for @xmath8 . if image points move according to the velocity field @xmath9 , then gray values @xmath10 are constant along motion trajectories @xmath11 .",
    "one obtains the optical flow equation .",
    "@xmath12 the previous equations lead to an ill - posed problem for the unknown @xmath13 .",
    "variational formulations or relaxed minimizing problems for computing jointly @xmath13 have been first proposed in @xcite and after by many other authors . here",
    "our concern is somewhat different .",
    "finding @xmath13 simultaneously is possible by solving a mass transport problem .",
    "similarly to the work developed in @xcite , a characterization of @xmath13 as solution of a minimizing problem is developed .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the cardiac images between two times arbitrary fixed to zero and one , the mathematical problem reads : find @xmath4 the gray level function defined from @xmath14 with values in @xmath15 $ ] verifying @xmath16 the velocity function @xmath5 , is determined in order to minimize the functional .",
