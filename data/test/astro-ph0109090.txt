    "one of the early surprises from the _ einstein _ mission was the detection of strong x - ray emission from o stars ( harnden et al .",
    "1979 ) . while the wind - shock paradigm for x - ray emission from hot stars ( lucy and white 1980 ; owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ; macfarlane & cassinelli 1989 ; hillier et al .",
    "1993 ; feldmeier et al . 1995 ; cohen et al . 1996",
    "; owocki & cohen 1999 ) has gained acceptance over the past two decades , there is increasing evidence that not all early - type stars have x - ray properties that can be explained by instability- generated wind shocks alone .",
    "this evidence includes very hot plasma on the young b0  v star @xmath2  sco ( cohen , cassinelli , & waldron 1997 ) , overall levels of x - ray emission that approach or even exceed reasonable estimates of the wind emission measure in early- and mid - b stars ( cohen , cassinelli , & macfarlane 1997 ) , and strong 15.4-day periodic x - ray emission on the central o star of the orion nebula , @xmath1  ori  c ( gagn et al . 1997 ) .    the lack of outer convection zones in hot stars , and the lack of any correlation between x - ray activity and rotation ( pallavicini et al .",
    "1981 ) has been taken to mean that the x - rays from early - type stars are not produced by magnetic activity associated with a solar - type dynamo .",
    "however , it has been suggested that large - scale magnetic fields , in conjunction with radiation - driven winds , could play a role in the x - ray production on some of these early - type stars ( e.g. , babel & montmerle 1997a ) . the strong and hard x - ray emission from @xmath1  ori  c , @xmath2  sco , as well as several other young hot stars ( corocoran et al .",
    "1994 ; yamauchi et al .",
    "et al . 1996 ; schulz et al . 2000 ) , suggest that some type of magnetic confinement , possibly associated with youth , may lead to the efficient production of hard x - rays on some hot stars .",
    "if the magnetic fields on hot stars survive the star - formation process , the transfer of angular momentum via a magnetized wind would lead to significant spin down .",
    "the discovery of strong variable x - ray emission from classical t - tauri stars ( ctts ) in taurus - auriga with _ einstein _ ( gahm et al . 1980 ) was less surprising because ttss were known to be relatively fast rotators , strong h@xmath5 sources , and to undergo strong white - light flares . since then",
    ", large - amplitude , long - duration flares have been observed many times with _",
    "einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _",
    "chandra_. the temperature of the flaring plasma rises from a quiescent value of 620  mk to a peak value of 50100  mk in minutes to hours and decays on time scales of many hours . the central question is whether ttss have very active solar - type coronae driven by a magnetic dynamo or whether flares are produced in some kind of a magnetosphere coupled to a disk .",
    "the x - ray flare spectra and light curves have been modeled in two ways : as a single heating event in a quasi - statically cooling magnetic loop and as a series of heating events in a coronal active region .",
    "e.g. , a giant _ asca _ flare on the weak - line t - tauri star ( wtts ) v  773 tau showed a peak temperature of 100  mk and a decay time of 2.3 hours ( tsuboi et al .",
    "a quasi - static cooling loop approximation implies moderate electron densities like those observed in solar flares and very large loop lengths , @xmath6 .",
    "favata , micela , & reale ( 2001 ) have modeled the same flare data hydrodynamically to show that such flares may be produced in much smaller loops . in this model ,",
    "long - duration flares are a manifestation of continuous reheating events rather than a single flare in a large , low - density loop .    _ asca _ flares on three young stellar objects ( ysos ) in @xmath4  ophiuchus , ylw  15 , wl  6 , and elias  29 , showed evidence of rotational modulation , quasi - periodic flaring , and significant spectral time variability ( tsuboi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "montmerle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) present a magnetosphere / disk interaction model to explain the quasi - periodic flares on the class i yso ylw 15 .",
    "again , favata , et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that such flares may reflect reheating events in high - latitude active regions .    the recent discovery of x - ray emission from deeply embedded submillimeter / radio dust condensations in the orion molecular cloud ( tsuboi et al .",
    "2001 ) indicates that magnetic heating begins at the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the large - scale magnetic fields which are believed to regulate accretion , mass - loss , and bipolar outflows are related to the reconnection events which lead to flares and x - ray activity .",
    "disk - photosphere coupling via a magnetic field was first suggested by knigl ( 1991 ) ( inspired by the model of ghosh & lamb 1979 ) to explain the slow rotation of cttss .",
    "a recent study of low - mass 1 - 30  myr stars in the orion nebula cluster and ngc 2264 ( rebull et al . 2001 ) found that pms stars evolve with nearly constant angular velocity as they contract down their convective tracks .",
    "this means that the mechanism which regulates the spin of a ctts may still be at work on wttss long after a dusty disk has been dissipated .",
    "if magnetic coupling still operates long into the wtts phase , then a gas ( plasma ) disk must exist within a few stellar radii of the photosphere .",
    "in this paper we will discuss recent _ chandra _ results which address magnetic activity on young high - mass and low - mass stars .",
    " 2 summarizes results based on _ asca _ and _ chandra _ light curves and ccd spectra of yso flares in @xmath4  ophiuchus . in ",
    "3 we describe the x - ray grating spectrum of the ctts tw hya and use the forbidden lines of ne  ix and o  vii to suggest a location for the x - ray emitting plasma . in ",
    "4 we describe grating spectra of four hot stars that , in some cases , provide strong evidence for magnetic confinement . in  5 we present 2-d mhd simulations of magnetically confined wind shocks .",
    "finally , we conclude that magnetic fields , disks , and mass - loss may play a central role in the production of x - rays on very young high - mass and low - mass stars .",
    "the @xmath4  ophiuchus a cloud was observed continuously for 96  ks with acis - i on 2000 may 15 . an rgb image of the fiterered event data with red = soft ( 0.5 - 1.5  kev ) , green = medium ( 1.5 - 2.5  kev ) , and blue = hard ( 2.5 - 8  kev ) shows 76 x - ray sources .",
    "highly absorbed ysos and background agn seen through 25 - 75 mag of visual absorption appear as blue sources in this image .",
    "twenty - two background agn have been identified as faint sources with high 2-kev hardness ratios and low kolmogorov - smirnov variability statistics . by dividing the event data into 31 time bins and removing flickering background pixels ,",
    "we have produced a color movie illustrating what montmerle et al .",
    "( 1983 ) described as an `` x - ray christmas tree '' in @xmath4  oph .    in figure  1",
    ", we present acis medium- and hard - band light curves of the low - mass yso gy  195 in @xmath4  oph  a. the lower panel is the time - series of 3-kev hardness ratios for gy  195 .",
    "this flare is interesting because of the deep dip in the hard - band ( @xmath7  kev ) light curve approximately @xmath8  ks after the start of the observation .",
    "initially , we interpreted this as evidence of self - eclipsing .",
    "however , the soft - band ( @xmath9  kev ) light curve shows a much smaller dip than expected . since the emission - measure distribution at the peak of a flare",
    "is dominated by very hot plasma ( @xmath10  mk ) , those times of the when the hard emission rises sharply probably correspond to reheating events .",
    "we see a few small flare events before the major peak at 41  ks , a rapid decay , and a series of reheating events at approximately 52 , 62 , 83 , and 93  ks .",
    "we have yet to perform a detailed spectral time - series analysis on these data , but our initial xspec analysis suggests a very hot , low - abundance coronal plasma , and high column density consistent with other embedded t tauri stars in @xmath4  oph .    the @xmath4  ophiuchus cloud contains two optically visible stars : the young , magnetic b3 star s1  oph and the wtts doar  21 .",
    "during the _ chandra _ observation , doar  21 was in the decay phase of a very large flare .",
    "although no major flares were seen on s1 , the light curve exhibits low - amplitude , long - term and short - term variability .",
    "the acis spectrum of this high - mass yso is reminiscent of low - mass ysos : @xmath11 and @xmath12  kev .",
    "simultaneous vla observations at 2 and 6  cm show variable , non - thermal radio emission , confirming its magnetic origin , first reported by andr et al .",
    "s1 s radio and x - ray properties make it a good candidate for magnetically confined wind shocks ( see  5 ) .",
    "with the launch of _ chandra _ and _ newton_-xmm , high - resolution grating spectroscopy has become an important new tool for studying x - ray activity on young stars .",
    "the he - like resonance ( r ) , intercombination ( i ) , and forbidden ( f ) lines of coronal sources like ab dor ( dotted line in fig .  2 ) are useful density diagnostics because the collisional excitation rate from the metastable @xmath13 state depends on density ( see figure  1 of gabriel & jordan 1969 ) .",
    "the critical density is reached when the collisional excitation rate equals the forbidden @xmath14 photodecay rate . for ab dor ,",
    "the forbidden - line emission is strong ; the s , si , mg , and ne @xmath15 ratios are close to their low - density limits . the o  vii @xmath15 ratio yields @xmath16 .    for tw hya , a classical t tauri star , the @xmath17 lines of ne  ix ( seen in fig .",
    "1 ) and o  vii are remarkably suppressed .",
    "kastner et al . (",
    "2001 ) measure @xmath18 for ne  ix indicating @xmath19 .",
    "this is the highest coronal density measured so far using @xmath15 ratios , exceeding that of ab dor by two orders of magnitude , possibly signaling a fundamental difference between coronal stars and t tauri stars .",
    "kastner et al .",
    "go further , suggesting that the bulk of the x - ray emission on tw hya is generated at the base of the accretion funnel which couples the accretion disk to the stellar photosphere .",
    "we point out , however , that ultraviolet emission can depopulate the metastable @xmath20 state via photoexcitation to the @xmath21 state ( see kahn et al .",
    "the forbidden line is suppressed when the @xmath22 photoexcitation rate @xmath23 approaches the @xmath14 photodecay rate @xmath24 . for o  vii and ne",
    "ix photoexcitation occurs in the ultraviolet at 1616 and 1246 .",
    "the photoexcitation rate for the metastable state of ne ix is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( cann & thakkar 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath27 ( drake 1971 ) implies a critical flux @xmath28 . tw hya s flux at 1245.8    from the iue archive is @xmath29 .",
    "we consider the simplest geometrical model : a star at a distance @xmath30 ( 56.4  pc for tw hya ) with x - ray and uv sources separated by a distance @xmath31 . in this case , @xmath32 .",
    "solving for the uv / x - ray separation at which @xmath33 , we find @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 .    on tw hya , the o  vii forbidden line is strongly suppressed .",
    "assuming @xmath36 and @xmath37 implies a critical incident flux @xmath38 .",
    "tw hya s iue flux at 1616.5    is @xmath39 , implying a critical uv / x - ray separation @xmath40 . since the o  vii @xmath17 line",
    "is entirely suppressed , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the ne  ix and o  vii @xmath15 ratios may be suppressed via ultraviolet photoexcitation , provided the x - rays are produced close to the uv continuum source .",
    "we note that t tauri stars have strong uv emission lines ( h  i , n  v , c  iv , si  iv ) produced by optically thin @xmath42  k plasma . the continuum emission ( which depopulates the @xmath43 state ) is not produced by an optically thin transition region .",
    "if this thick material is distributed over much of the photosphere , the uv continuum would be too diluted to suppress the o  vii and ne  ix forbidden lines .",
    "the forbidden lines are suppressed if the x - rays are emitted at the base of the accretion funnel directly above the optically thick uv hotspot .",
    "an alternate hypothesis is that x - ray emitting magnetic loops are distributed throughout an active corona . in this case , the @xmath15 ratios are unaffected by uv flux and @xmath44 , the total particle density @xmath45 , the mean temperature in the loop is at the peak of the emission - measure distribution @xmath46 , and the total gas pressure in the loop is @xmath47 .",
    "the mean magnetic field strength required to confine such a loop is @xmath48 .",
    "direct measurements of magnetic field strengths and filling factors on other t tauri star indicate very strong 14  kg fields concentrated in cool spots covering a large fraction of the photosphere ( johns - krull , valenti , & koresko 1999 ; guenther et al .",
    "1999 ) . even allowing for the geometric reduction in the magnetic intensity as",
    "loops expand into the corona , coronal loops on t tauri stars can sufficiently confine high - density coronal plasma .    in conclusion , x - ray and far - uv spectra of t tauri stars may provide a key test of accretion - powered x - ray activity . if the forbidden lines are suppressed by photoexcitation , si  xiii , mg  ix , ne  ix , and o  vii @xmath15 ratios will yield self - consistent estimates of the uv / x - ray source separation .",
    "the far - ultraviolet flux from ob stars is @xmath49 times brighter than on t tauri stars like tw hya . as a result ,",
    "o  vii and ne  ix f - line emission is essentially absent .",
    "the @xmath22 transitions of mg  xi and si xiii at 1024.4    and 901.8   , respectively , are used to estimate the average distance bewteen the photosphere and the x - ray emitting region .",
    "kahn et al . ( 2001 ) and cassinelli et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown for @xmath0  pup ( o4  if ) that the visible x - rays are emitted @xmath50 from the photosphere where the overlying wind becomes optically thin at the wavelengths of mg  xi , si  xiii , and s  xv .",
    "these results indicate that x - ray emitting regions are distributed throughout the wind as predicted by instability - driven wind shock theory .",
    "@xmath0  pup s x - ray line profiles provide further confirmation of this picture . in the upper left panel of figure  3 ,",
    "the 12.1    ne  x line of @xmath0  pup is blueshifted , broad , and asymmetric because the optically thick wind absorbs most of the x - rays from receding shocked material on the far side of the star .",
    "the challenge for wind shock models is to produce strong enough shocks at the base of the wind to explain the si  xiii and s  xv emission .    while high - resolution spectra of @xmath0  pup support the distributed wind - shock hypothesis , hetg spectra of three other hot stars are more difficult to explain . in fig .",
    "3 , the ne  x line of @xmath1  ori  c ( o7  v ) and @xmath2  sco ( b0  v ) do not show obvious line asymmetries . in their analysis of the @xmath1  ori  c spectrum , schulz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a range of line widths ( @xmath51 ) and no systematic line shifts .",
    "schulz et al . ( 2000 ) state that these results are consistent with instability - driven wind shocks .",
    "however , owocki & cohen ( 2001 ) have shown that the substantial amount of emission longward of line center is difficult to reconcile with the expected attenuation by the wind .",
    "based on @xmath15 ratios , waldron & cassinelli ( 2001 ) find that the hottest plasma around @xmath0  ori must lie less than @xmath52 from the photosphere , concluding that wind shocks and some magnetic confinement of turbulent hot plasma may be required .",
    "the @xmath2  sco lines are narrow and may not be produced in outflowing material many stellar radii from the photosphere .",
    "the 1012   spectra of @xmath0 pup , @xmath1  ori  c , and @xmath2  sco also exhibit striking differences .",
    "@xmath0 pup ( see figure  3 of cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 and figure  5 of kahn et al .",

    "to date , instability - driven wind shock models can not produce such high - temperature shocks , especially not on ob stars like @xmath1  ori  c and @xmath2  sco with relatively low mass - loss rates and terminal wind speeds .",
    "the leading theoretical picture for x - ray production in magnetized hot stars is the magnetically confined wind shock ( mcws ) model proposed by babel & montmerle ( 1997a ) and applied by the same authors to @xmath1  ori  c ( 1997b ) . in this model ,",
    "an ionized , radiation - driven wind is confined to flow along a magnetic dipole field and is thus channeled , at low latitudes , into the magnetic equatorial plane . in the magnetic equator ,",
    "the streams from the two hemispheres collide and are confined by the dipole field , producing a standing shock and x - ray emission above and below a disk - like feature above the magnetic equator .",
    "this model succeeds in producing relatively hard x - rays ( due to the nearly head - on collision of two fast streams ) , high levels of emission ( due to the confinement at relatively high densities of the shock - heated plasma ) , and rotational modulation of the x - rays , like that observed in @xmath1  ori  c , if the dipole field is tilted with respect to the rotational axis .",
    "this oblique magnetic rotator model has been used to explain many of @xmath1  ori  c s curious behaviors : periodic h@xmath5 and he  ii emission and periodic c  iv and si  iv p - cygni profiles ( stahl et al . 1993 ; walborn & nichols 1994 ; stahl et al .",

    "this implies that x - ray , h@xmath5 and he  ii emission is greatest when looking down on the magnetic pole ( phase 0.0 ) .",
    "emission is weakest when looking at the magnetic equator ( phase 0.5 ) , presumably because hot plasma just above the magnetic equator is eclipsed by the photosphere .",

    "<S> high - resolution x - ray spectra of high - mass stars and low - mass t - tauri stars obtained during the first year of the _ chandra _ mission are providing important clues about the mechanisms which produce x - rays on very young stars . for @xmath0  pup </S>",
    "<S> ( o4  if ) and @xmath0  ori ( o9.5  i ) , the broad , blue - shifted line profiles , line ratios , and derived temperature distribution suggest that the x - rays are produced throughout the wind via instability - driven wind shocks . </S>",
    "<S> for some less luminous ob stars , like @xmath1  ori  c ( o7  v ) and @xmath2  sco ( b0  v ) , the line profiles are symmetric and narrower . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of time - variable emission and very high - temperature lines in @xmath1  ori  c and @xmath2  sco suggest that magnetically confined wind shocks may be at work . </S>",
    "<S> the grating spectrum of the classical t - tauri star tw  hya is remarkable because the forbidden - line emission of he - like ne  ix and o  vii is very weak , implying that the x - ray emitting region is very dense , @xmath3 , or that the x - rays are produced very close to the ultraviolet hotspot at the base of an accretion funnel . </S>",
    "<S> acis light curves and spectra of flares and low - mass and high - mass young stellar objects in orion and @xmath4  ophiuchus further suggest that extreme magnetic activity is a general property of many very young stars .    </S>",
