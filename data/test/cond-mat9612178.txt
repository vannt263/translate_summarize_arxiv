    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been applied in surprisingly many fields of physics and mathematics .",
    "we have proposed in a recent letter @xcite its application to transfer matrices of lattice models in classical statistical mechanics . in a preceding paper @xcite , referred to hereafter as paper i , we have given the details of this rmt analysis applied to the general eight - vertex model .",
    "we have numerically shown that the integrability of the model can be seen on the statistical properties of the entire spectrum of transfer matrices of vertex models . using this as a criterion for integrability",
    ", we have located all the known integrable varieties in the parameter space . in this paper",
    "we continue this work with the study of spin models .",
    "many aspects have already been presented in paper i , so we will recall below only the basic ideas of the rmt analysis with emphasis on the points which are specific to spin models .",
    "an important area of application of rmt is the characterization of chaos  @xcite .",
    "one can describe the fluctuations of energy spectra of chaotic systems with some ensembles of rmt , while the spectra of regular systems show the characteristics of independent numbers ( poissonian ensemble ) .",
    "in classical ( hamiltonian ) mechanics , the notions of regular and chaotic dynamics coincide with the notions of integrability and non - integrability .",
    "but in quantum mechanics the notions of chaos and integrability are less precise ; one nowadays adopts the criterion of rmt as a definition of quantum chaos . for models of quantum statistical mechanics",
    "one can adopt a definition of integrability related to the bethe ansatz : an integrable system is a system for which a complete set of eigenstates having the bethe ansatz form exists . for a classical statistical mechanics model ,",
    "the notion of integrability is generally related to the yang  baxter equations .",
    "for example , solving the yang ",
    "baxter equations for the symmetric eight - vertex model ( also called the baxter model ) allows to build a one - parameter family of commuting transfer matrices , and finally to compute the free energy of the model @xcite .",
    "the spin version of the yang - baxter equations are the star - triangle equations which have been introduced earlier @xcite . solving these star - triangle equations",
    "also allows to construct an infinite family of commuting transfer matrices .",
    "we note that a vertex model can be turned into a spin model with many - spin interactions ( irf model ) ( see for example @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we treat spin models including only two - spin interactions , possibly coupled to an external field , and by integrable we mean yang - baxter integrable as well as star - triangle integrable .    the spectrum of an integrable system , after a suitable treatment",
    ", has been shown to have many properties of a set of random _ independent _ numbers ( poissonian behavior ) , while the spectrum of a chaotic system is described quite accurately by the spectrum of matrices of statistical ensembles .",
    "the choice of the proper ensemble depends on very general symmetry properties of the model under consideration . for a time reversal symmetric model",
    "this ensemble is the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite .",
    "this classification scheme has been applied succesfully to quantum spin models in one dimension @xcite and on two - dimensional lattices @xcite .    for a classical lattice spin model ,",
    "the energy spectrum is usually very simple .",
    "( for an ising model this spectrum contains all the possible numbers of violated bonds i.e.  the set of integers @xmath0 $ ] where @xmath1 is the number of bonds ; the physical properties of the model are contained in the degeneracies , its statistical properties have been studied in ref .",
    "therefore the analysis has to be performed on another quantity .",
    "the transfer matrix is such an operator ( related to the hamiltonian ) which describes completely the thermodynamic properties of a system including the size effects @xcite , and we will perform the rmt analysis on its spectrum .",
    "it has already been shown in paper i and in @xcite that the notion of yang ",
    "baxter integrability coincides with a poissonian spectrum , and that nonintegrable spectra are described by goe matrix spectra . to perform this rmt analysis in its usual form",
    ", one needs to deal with a real spectrum . for spin models and",
    "when the interactions are nonchiral ( symmetric ) , this can be achieved using the so - called row - to - row ( or layer - to - layer in higher dimension ) transfer matrix as explained below .",
    "we also have studied the spectra in the nonphysical regime where the boltzmann weights are not positive . indeed , most of the analytical results concern varieties in the entire parameter space including the region where the boltzmann weights are negative . in this region ,",
    "even row - to - row transfer matrices can have complex eigenvalues .",
    "the necessary changes in the analysis will be briefly discussed .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ s : numeric ] we recall the numerical methods of the rmt analysis with a special emphasis on the specificity of the spin models we investigate . in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] we present the numerical results , succesively of the two - dimensional ising model in absence of magnetic field ( a paradigm of an integrable system ! ) , the same two - dimensional ising model in a magnetic field , the three - dimensional ising model ( a paradigm of nonintegrable system ! ) , and the three - state potts model .",
    "the three - state potts model provides an example of a point which is integrable and critical at the same time .",
    "by contrast , the three - dimensional ising model provides a nonintegrable , but critical , point .",
    "finally , we investigate a nonphysical self - dual point of the three - state potts model .",
    "this is a first attempt to study complex spectra in the context of this statistical analysis of transfer matrices .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ s : conclusion ] with a discussion .",
    "the machinery of random matrix theory has been explained in details in paper i. it consists in five distinct steps :    * the first one is to choose a representation basis for the operator and to construct the corresponding matrix ; * the second step consists in finding the parameter - independent stable subspaces and find the matrices representing the operator in each of these subspaces ; * the third step is to diagonalize each matrix ; * the fourth step is to ` unfold ' each spectrum ; * and in the fifth step all the spectral quantities are computed .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss these five points and give the details which are specific to the spin models studied in this paper .",
    "\\(i ) we use the transfer matrix formalism , where the lattice is built up adding identical `` generating sub - lattices '' .",
    "these generating sublattices can be rows for two - dimensional models or rectangular layers for three - dimensional lattices . for spin models",
    ", it is well known that this transfer matrix can be factorized as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 contains the interactions between two generating sub - lattices and @xmath4 contains the interactions inside a generating sub - lattice ; @xmath4 is usually a diagonal matrix .",
    "@xmath5 are the coupling constants in the different directions , we assign the direction 1 to be the direction in which the lattice grows . for each case",
    "we study in this paper , the precise form of @xmath4 and @xmath3 are given in the corresponding section . in the form ( [ e : transfer ] ) the transfer matrix is a symmetric matrix if the interaction between the two layers and thus the matrix @xmath3 is symmetric",
    ". if the boltzmann weights are real positive , the entries of the transfer matrix are also real positive . in this case of a real and symmetric ( transfer ) matrix the spectrum is real so that the methods for the statistical analysis presented in paper i apply .",
    "\\(ii ) to find the parameter independent subspaces one needs to know the symmetries of the generating sub - lattices . for the transfer matrix of a @xmath6-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice",
    "these generating sub - lattices are @xmath7-dimensional lattices .",
    "for the square lattice , the generating sub - lattice is a periodic chain .",
    "as explained in paper i the symmetry group is the dihedral group @xmath8 . for a three - dimensional cubic lattice we use a square lattice as the generating sub - lattice . for an isotropic square lattice the automorphy group has been detailed in @xcite ( with emphasis on the atypical case @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is a large group which leads to consequent size reduction ( see sec .",
    "[ ss : ising3d ] ) .",
    "in addition to these space symmetries there is a ` color symmetry ' when no field is applied .",
    "this symmetry reflects the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant under a permutation of the possible values of the spin variables ( i.e.  spin reversal symmetry for the ising model ) . for a @xmath10-state model ,",
    "this is a @xmath11 symmetry ; in this paper we work with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this ` color - symmetry ' commutes with the space symmetries .",
    "\\(iii ) the diagonalization of the blocks is done numerically using standard procedures of the lapack library .",
    "we note that the block - diagonalization of step ( ii ) requires more numerical effort ( cpu time ) than the diagonalization of one block .",
    "\\(iv ) the unfolding procedure is the same as the procedure detailed in paper i. it produces the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath14 from the raw eigenvalues @xmath15 .",
    "the spectra of spin and vertex models are quite similar .",
    "however , we also have analyzed _ complex _ spectra . in that case",
    "the eigenvalues are seen as points in the plane ( and not on a line ) the local density of which has to be made constant . to unfold complex spectra",
    "we follow the procedure described in chap .",
    "8.6 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(v ) the spectral analysis is performed on the same quantities as in paper i. these are the level spacing distribution @xmath16 of the differences between two consecutive unfolded eigenvalues @xmath17 ( for a nonintegrable model , the eigenvalue spacing distribution is very close to the wigner surmise for the goe : @xmath18 in contrast , with the exponential @xmath19 for a set of independent eigenvalues for an integrable model ) ; the spectral rigidity : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the integrated density of unfolded eigenvalues and @xmath22 denotes an average over @xmath23 ; another quantity of interest is the number variance @xmath24 defined as the variance of the number of unfolded eigenvalues in an interval of length @xmath25 : @xmath26 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle_{\\varepsilon},\\ ] ] where the brackets denote an averaging over @xmath27 .",
    "the expected behavior in the limiting cases of independent numbers and of goe spectra has been recalled in paper i ; for more details see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also recall the parametrized probability distribution we use to interpolate between the poisson law and the wigner law : ( * ? ? ?",
    "16.8 ) : @xmath28 with @xmath29^{1+\\beta}$ ] .",
    "the interpolation parameter @xmath30 proved itself to be a useful indicator for the localization of integrable varieties @xcite .",
    "there should be no confusion of this parameter @xmath30 with the inverse temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we start our analysis with the two - dimensional ising model , which is well known to be integrable in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite . to work with symmetric matrices we use the row - to - row transfer matrix . for a rectangular @xmath32 lattice with periodic boundary conditions",
    "the ( reduced ) hamiltonian reads : @xmath33 where @xmath30 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the coupling constants in the two directions divided by the temperature .",
    "the partition function is @xmath36 where the row - to - row transfer matrix @xmath37 is given by : @xmath38 the matrix @xmath39 is a @xmath40 diagonal matrix with entries @xmath41_{\\alpha,\\alpha } = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}{w_2^{\\alpha_i \\alpha_{i+1 } } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 according to the @xmath43 digit of the binary representation of @xmath23 and @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix @xmath45 is a symmetric matrix @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 do not play the same role here .",
    "if all the boltzmann weights are real and positive , and using the circular property of the trace , @xmath37 can be replaced by the similar matrix @xmath48 it is clear that @xmath49 is symmetric and therefore has a real spectrum .",
    "this spectrum has been completely worked out for even size @xmath50 in @xcite . from the explicit form of the eigenvalues",
    "it is easy to check that the entire spectrum is invariant by negating the boltzmann weights @xmath51 and we can restrict ourselves to the physical case @xmath52 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the problem of diagonalizing @xmath49 can be turned into a problem of free fermions .",
    "namely one has : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are fermionic operators .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath55 is a cosine and its detailed form depends on the parity of the number of @xmath56-particles .",
    "therefore , fixing all the``quantum number '' @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is the momentum of the @xmath43 @xmath56-particle , _ completely _ determines an eigenvalue and an eigenstate of the transfer matrix .",
    "however , instead of using the complete set of quantum numbers , we take only into account the quantum numbers which correspond to parameter - independent symmetries . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s : numeric ] , the space symmetries of @xmath49 form a group isomorphic to @xmath58{0.06ex}{1.15ex}\\!\\mbox{$\\times$ } z_2 $ ] , and in the absence of a magnetic field the spin reversal symmetry induces an extra @xmath59 symmetry which commutes with @xmath8 . using the projectors independent of @xmath34 and @xmath35 onto the corresponding invariant subspaces , the transfer matrix is block diagonalized .",
    "the dimensions of the blocks are given in table [ t : ising2d ] .",
    "we note that using these projectors leaves a few degeneracies inside some blocks .",
    "we also note that some eigenvalues are independent of the value of @xmath35 . in appendix",
    "[ a : appendix ] all these @xmath60 @xmath35-independent eigenvalues occuring only when the size @xmath50 is a multiple of four , are determined analytically .",
    "having discarded the degenerate states and the @xmath35-independent states in each representation one can perform the rmt analysis .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] shows the level spacing distribution for @xmath61 of the representation labelled @xmath62 of @xmath63 ( see table  [ t : ising2d ] ) .",
    "one finds roughly an exponential distribution which is expected for an integrable model .",
    "our explanation for the deviation from the exponential is the following : for an integrable system we do not sort the states according to all their `` quantum numbers '' ( doing that will leave us with blocks of size 1 ) .",
    "we therefore treat together eigenvalues belonging to states having different symmetries , but these states are only approximately independent .",
    "we also have performed the same numerical analysis on _ all _ eigenvalues computed with formula ( [ e : lambda ] ) and the result is even worse .",
    "this result is characteristic of the free - fermion nature of the problem ( note that the parameter @xmath30 has been found always negative on the free - fermion variety of the eight - vertex model @xcite ) .",
    "the same form of the spacing distribution is found for any value of the boltzmann weights , even for negative boltzmann weights . however",
    ", if one of the boltzmann weight is ` too large ' or ` too small ' some entries of the transfer matrix become huge and this leads to numerical instabilities in the diagonalization . on the other hand ,",
    "if the boltzmann weights are ` too close ' to unity ( decoupling limit ) many eigenvalues are almost - degenerate which leads to difficulties in the unfolding procedure .",
    "we note finally that the critical point does not manifest itself in any manner on the spacing distribution nor on the spectral rigidity @xmath64 .",
    "we now investigate the case where a magnetic field is turned on .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath65 @xmath66 being the field times the inverse temperature , and the transfer matrix reads @xmath67^{1/2 } h(k_1 ) [ v(k_2)b(k)]^{1/2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the same matrices as defined by eq .",

    "the behavior of @xmath30 is unambiguous : the magnetic field induces a wigner type distribution of the spacing distribution .",
    "the drop of @xmath30 is sharp as the magnetic field goes to zero . on fig .",
    "[ f : figx ] the negative value of the parameter @xmath30 in zero field is due to the free - fermion nature of the two dimensional ising model in absence of magnetic field .",
    "we interpret the small width of the peak as a size effect , and we claim that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath30 is strictly zero only for a zero magnetic field .",
    "this underlines the very singular nature of integrability .",
    "probing the value of @xmath30 in the physical region of the parameter space , we did not have find other integrable points than the points where the magnetic field is zero .",
    "we now investigate another archetypal case of non - integrability in statistical mechanics : the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "this model can still be mapped onto a fermion problem like in two dimensions , but in three dimensions the fermions are correlated @xcite and the partition function can not be summed up in a closed form .",

    "we still have the spin reversal symmetry , but the space group is more involved than for the two - dimensional model , since the automorphy group of a square lattice is larger than the automorphy group of a ring ( see sec .",
    "[ s : numeric ] ) .",
    "using rectangular @xmath85 layers would have led to much simpler calculations since the symmetry group would have been simply @xmath86 . however , the size reduction of the matrix would have been less and consequently also the numerically accesible lattice sizes .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the size effects are not controlled by the dimension of the subblocks of the transfer matrix , but by the size of the lattice .",
    "moreover , we have studied the particular case @xmath9 for which the generic symmetry group of the isotropic square lattice @xmath87 has to be replaced by a larger group ( for the technical details see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with the two - dimensional case , projecting onto invariant subspaces lifts _ all _ degeneracies within each subblock ( note that using the generic @xmath87 group would have left degeneracies inside some blocks ) .",

    "no special behavior is found .",
    "this strongly suggests that the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of transfer matrices are governed by the status of the model with respect to integrability rather than to criticality .    to go from a two - dimensional model to a three - dimensional model we have recorded the value of @xmath30 when the interaction @xmath90 in the third dimension is turned on continuously .",
    "[ f : fig4 ] summarizes the results : a vanishingly small coupling in the third direction induces level repulsion .",

    "in particular , the spacing distribution is an exponential law for integrable systems while it is close to the wigner surmise for nonintegrable systems .",
    "quantities involving more than two closest eigenvalues , like the rigidity , also show a goe behavior on a quite large scale involving up to 25 eigenvalues in the case of the square lattice ising model with field .",
    "the independence of eigenvalues for integrable models has been checked on the ising model in two dimensions in absence of a magnetic field , as well as on the critical point of the three - state potts model .",
    "we also have studied the transition point of three - dimensional ising model , for which we have found eigenvalue repulsion and a good agreement of the spacing distribution with the wigner surmise .",
    "this stresses the difference between criticality and integrability : the eigenvalue statistics is sensible to integrability and not to criticality .    using the eigenvalue statistics as a criterion of integrablity we support the hypothesis that the two - dimensional ising model in a field and the three - dimensional ising model are not integrable .",
    "the integrable models appear as very singular and isolated in parameter space .",
    "this is clearly seen on curves showing the parameter @xmath30 as a function of a boltzmann weight , where @xmath30 is close to unity almost everywhere , except for the particular values where the model is integrable . with the sizes numerically tractable the variation of @xmath30 is abrupt , and",
    "the size behavior suggests that in the thermodynamic limit the statistics changes discontinuously . to clearify this point ,",
    "a more detailed study of the size effects is needed .",
    "it would also be interesting , but difficult , to study the potts model with a large number of states to have a first order phase transition point which is integrable .    to use the criterion of eigenvalue spacing statistics with new models ( for example chiral models ) one needs to study complex spectra in many cases .",
    "the distinction between independent eigenvalues for integrable models and repelling eigenvalues for nonintegrable models still holds .",
    "however , a repulsion between eigenvalues in one dimension is much easier to quantify than in two dimensions .",
    "intuitively this can be understood since in two dimensions the eigenvalues are not restricted to a line and have naturally more space to avoid each other .",
    "the repulsion between eigenvalues in two dimensions has less effect than in one dimension .",
    "we have found that for the three - state potts model and for a boltzmann weight @xmath126 the spectrum is complex and that the eigenvalue spacing distribution is characteristic of eigenvalue repulsion .",
    "however , when @xmath127 is close to the negative self - dual value we recover a distribution close to the wigner law indicating here eigenvalue independence associated to integrability .",
    "the numerical difficulties arising with complex spectra are of importance and we need to refine further the analysis , and especially the unfolding , to study convicingly chiral models .",
    "this is in progress .    in these two papers",
    "we have shown numerically that the statistical properties of transfer matrix spectra of classical statistical mechanics models are related to the integrability of the model , extending hereby the field of application of rmt",
    ". this can be useful in the search for new integrable models .",
    "it has been established in @xcite that the spectrum of the row - to - row anisotropic ising model for an even size @xmath50 is given by : @xmath128 ^{n/2 }      \\exp\\left(- \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{q=0}^{n-1}{\\tau_q \\epsilon_q}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath129 according to the @xmath130 digit of the binary representation of @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , and for all @xmath10 with @xmath133 : @xmath134 where @xmath135 if there is an even number of 1 in the base two representation of @xmath131 and @xmath136 otherwise . for @xmath137 , the positive root of eq .",
    "( [ e : app ] ) has to be taken except for @xmath138 where @xmath139 and for @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 is the dual coupling constant defined by @xmath143 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath144 with respect to @xmath35 is @xmath145 with @xmath146 it is easy to check that for an _ even _ number of particles : @xmath147 while for an _ odd _ number of particles : @xmath148 and @xmath149    when the size @xmath50 is a multiple of 4 and when there are @xmath150 particles , then the number of particles is even and we must use the formula ( [ e : even ] ) .",
    "there are @xmath151 choices of @xmath131 such that @xmath152 for @xmath153 . in that case one",
    "has : @xmath154 this gives @xmath151 @xmath35-independent states .",
    "@xmath50 being still a multiple of 4 and taking @xmath155 particles we now must use formul  ( [ e : odd ] ) and ( [ e : odd1 ] )",
    ". there are @xmath156 choices of @xmath131 such that @xmath157 for @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in that case one",
    "has @xmath160    collecting the three cases mentioned above we get @xmath60 @xmath35-independent states .",
    "it is then simple to verify that the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath161 where @xmath162 , @xmath150 or @xmath163 is the number of particles .",
