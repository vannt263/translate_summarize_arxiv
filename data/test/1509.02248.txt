    "the advanced generation of the ligo - virgo network of interferometers  @xcite started collecting data in september 2015 and provided the first detection of gravitational waves ( gws )  @xcite , allowing to start testing general relativity ( gr ) beyond current constraints  @xcite into strongly relativistic regimes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we quantify the capability of laser interferometers to detect violations of gr , with a single detection of a compact binary coalescence signal , by assessing if the minimal error on the parameterized post - einsteinian ( ppe ) parameters are larger than the separation of modified gravity values with respect to standard gr values .",
    "error bounds are computed with the most accurate frequentist approach to date by computing the errors as inverse power series in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , where the first order is the inverse of the fisher information matrix  @xcite . in this paper we model gr violations with the ppe framework  @xcite , which produces parametrized extensions of gr gw signals for the inspiral phase only of a binary compact coalescence in the absence of spin ( similar extensions are currently not available for the merger and ringdown phase as well as in the presence of spin ) .",
    "the square root of the inverse fisher matrix diagonal elements , also known as the cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) , is a lower limit in the error of any unbiased estimator in the absence of prior knowledge . in this regard",
    "the crlb is a statement about the amount of information available in the data regardless of the specific parameter estimation scheme .",
    "there is however no guarantee that any estimator is capable to actually attain the crlb for part or the whole range of values the physical parameters can assume .",
    "also , the crlb only takes into account the curvature of the probability distribution of the data around the true value of the parameters and therefore does not include the role of secondary maxima in the calculation of the variance or mean square error of the estimators .",
    "the improved bound adopted here ( based on second order asymptotics ) is larger than the inverse fisher matrices , known to underestimate errors in low - snr detections .",
    "second - order bounds have been previously used for compact binary coalescence waveforms in quantifying the accuracy in intrinsic parameters as well as the direction of arrival for a network of laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "the benefits of using the second order of the expansions is in the fact that they depend up to the fourth derivative of the likelihood function and , therefore , are sensitive to asymmetries and side lobes of the estimator probability distribution ( similar to the change in the accuracy of a taylor expansion when extended to higher orders ) .",
    "also , in the past  @xcite , the comparison of the second order with the first order provided an analytical understanding of the reasons the crlb could not be met ( for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a novel relationship between the kurtosis of the probability distribution of the estimator and the snr was derived to understand when the crlb could be met ) .",
    "bayesian methods were recently applied to test modified gr signals through consistency tests  @xcite , and the ppe framework  @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a framework to detect gr violations without modeling the violation , this works in the limit of large number of detections .",
    "this framework was used in gr tests from the gw150914 transient  @xcite .",
    "bayesian selection methods were also used in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain the range of ppe parameter values , provided that priors are adopted .",
    "when bayesian uncertainties are smaller than the frequentist bounds , it means that the parameter estimation errors depend critically on the priors .",

    "@xcite of the effects of priors ) . in this paper",

    "this example illustrates how the present work provides a unique understanding of the parameter estimation errors .",

    "calculations in this limit were chosen since deformations to the gw s phase are expected to be more resolvable  @xcite and complements recent bayesian methods testing deviations from gr  @xcite .",
    "second - order frequentist constraints produced in this paper are at the same order of magnitude as the bayesian model selection s errors in ref .",
    "@xcite , where our errors are quantified at the one sigma level . as error estimates of ppe parameters grow , second - order errors of parameters such as the chirp mass , symmetric mass ratio , and time of coalescence also inflate . the results presented here , and the rescaled bonds which can be simply derived by changing the snr , will be important benchmarks for any parameter estimation scheme which will be used in existing and future interferometer data , including bayesian parameter estimation algorithms .    section  [ stat_model_sig ] of this paper introduces the signal model used .",
    "section  [ param_space_expan ] discusses what is the resolvable parameter space and the expansion model , in particular subsection  [ ppe_model ] discusses alternative theories of gravity covered in this paper and the asymptotic expansion of the maximum likelihood estimator model is discussed in subsection  [ expan ] . finally , section  [ results ] assesses the results , as applied to a two - dimensional ppe parameter space ( [ bidimen ] ) and a seven - dimensional parameter space of equal mass ( [ 7dimen ] ) and unequal mass ( [ 7dimen2 ] ) systems with physical parameters included .",

    "for non - spinning systems thirteen parameters are necessary in the description of the inspiral of two coalescing binaries : two mass terms , four angles ( two source location and two waveform angles ) , two coalescence parameters , distance to the source , and four ppe parameters in the leading order approximation .",
    "singular fisher matrices might appear  @xcite , indicating that the resolvable parameter space is smaller ( where the fisher matrix approach can still be used ) .",
    "the distance @xmath22 is excluded from the error estimates because the amplitude has a dependency on both mass and distance parameters , and the independent treatment of both is unresolvable as already indicated in ref .",
    "the coalescence phase is also not included because estimations of @xmath23 is relevant only when a full waveform ( inspiral , merger , and ringdown ) is implemented .",

    "the @xmath29 represent noise weighted inner products  @xcite and @xmath30 are gw signals controlled by general parameter space vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 . keeping other parameters fixed and varying only @xmath27 produces change in the snr equivalent to the rescaling of the distance , which affects gw plus - cross polarizations similarly .",
