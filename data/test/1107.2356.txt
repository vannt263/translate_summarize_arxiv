    "+ in case of source detection , we finally reconstruct its position along the @xmath31 axis , by taking the remaining events and fitting @xmath34 versus @xmath31 with a straight line .",
    "this also gives an estimate of the local regular gmf deflection power , @xmath15 .",
    "we study below how the efficiency of the method presented above changes with values of physical or experimental parameters .",
    "+ there are two requirements for source detection .",
    "first , the probability to detect the source doublets has to be large enough , in order not to remove too much source signal .",
    "second , the probability to be confused by some background has to be low enough compared to the probability to detect the source signal . + we define here a `` cluster '' as a group of at least three nearby events with very high energies , @xmath17ev .",
    "the probability to have a cluster of background events is very low in case of reasonable statistics and no -or low- anisotropy .",
    "for example it is @xmath35% , with 5000 events in the whole sky above 10@xmath1ev and no anisotropy . on the contrary ,",
    "the probability to have a background doublet of very high energy events is , in most cases , not negligible compared to the probability to have a source doublet .",
    "that is why we separate the two cases -doublet or cluster- below . in case of a doublet",
    ", we apply the method depicted in the previous section , whereas in case of a cluster , we do not need it since the source is already detected in @xmath36% of cases . applying the method reduces the background more than the signal from the source , but its side - effect is to reduce the signal from the source in any case .",
    "that is why it is not worth applying it when the probability to be confused by some background is already very low .",
    "however , when statistics increase , or in case of a large anisotropy above @xmath37ev , background clusters become more frequent and the method would then also be interesting for clusters of 3 events . +    , with a constant ratio @xmath38 set to 0.5 .",

    "[ turbfield ] , @xmath28 g and the turbulent field strength @xmath41 varies between 2 and 8@xmath2 g .",
    "the internal parameters of the method have been optimized for each field strength .",
    "the dotted line is the probability that a proton source of luminosity above 10@xmath26ev equal to 2.6% of the total luminosity in uhecr emits a doublet or a cluster of events with energies @xmath17ev .",
    "the dashed - dotted and the dashed lines are respectively the probabilities to have a source or background doublet .",
    "the thick and the thin solid lines represent the probabilities to respectively detect the source or the background .",
    "one can notice that even for the largest field strengths in these ranges , the ability of the method to detect the source is still quite acceptable .",
    "the difference between the dashed and the thin solid lines shows the efficiency to remove the background .",
    "the difference between the dashed - dotted and the thick solid lines is smaller : the source signal is less removed than the background .",
    "the difference between dotted and dashed - dotted lines corresponds , in practice , to cases when the source is already detected thanks to clusters of events .",
    "+ these results are computed for an isotropic sky , even at the highest energies .",
    "we checked that for reasonable values of anisotropies ( if all events with energies above 10@xmath26ev are located in a fraction of the sky larger than 25% ) , results would be affected in a linear way .",
    "for example , in the case of a 25% fraction , the probabilities to have a background doublet and to detect it would be both approximately multiplied by 4 .",
    "+ we have studied the dependence on source parameters .",
    "we show in ref .",
    "@xcite results for the dependence on the source luminosity .",
    "we point out that with a regular gmf deflection power , for example close to @xmath42ev for protons , one can still detect a light nuclei source , but only by looking for clusters if the source luminosity is sufficient . in this case ,",
    "the ratio `` signal / background '' for doublets would be too small to detect such sources .",
    "we have also presented results on the dependence on experimental statistics .",
    "there is no clear and no general best energy threshold @xmath16 to look for lower energy tails of events .",
    "when @xmath16 is decreased , the probability to detect a source doublet through the method increases , but the probability to be confused by a background doublet increases with a larger rate .",
    "for the example considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath39ev@xmath43ev is a good compromise between sufficient source detection and sufficient background rejection .",
    "the impact of the total amount of experimental data mostly affects the way the detection should be done , depending on the source luminosity .",
    "for example , with a bright source and large statistics like 10@xmath44 events above 10@xmath1ev , clusters of source events appear more often and looking for them becomes a more efficient way to track the source than applying the method for doublets . however , when the amount of data still increases , the method used previously for doublets will also start to be needed for clusters , so as to reject background ones .",
    "in this section , we discuss the ability of the method to reconstruct the source position and the local regular gmf deflection power @xmath15 .",

    "[ distances ] .",
    "thus , the angular resolution of this method for the source position reconstruction is of the order of the experimental angular resolution . +",
    "another noticeable result is that , in the same conditions , the local deflection power @xmath15 of the regular gmf component can be reconstructed with up to 25% precision in 68% of cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dpow ] -see thick solid line .",
    "+ the above results are mainly spoiled by the turbulent field . for comparison",
    ", we put in the same plots the distributions with @xmath45 g ( thin solid line ) and @xmath46 g ( dashed line ) . the lower the turbulent field strength , the better the precisions on both results . for these lower @xmath41 strengths , the distance on the sky between the reconstructed and the real sources would be mostly affected by the experimental angular resolution and not by the method .",
    "+ the strength of the regular field ( for @xmath5 g at the sun position ) does not change the precision on the reconstruction of @xmath15 , but the precision on the source position reconstruction is better for low @xmath40 values .",
    "+ if we simulate the experimental resolution on energies by taking values such as @xmath47% instead of @xmath48 ( theoretical energies ) , no noticeable change can be seen in our results .",
    "we have proposed and studied here an alternative way to detect individual bright uhecr sources , if the uhecr deflections due to the turbulent gmf are not too large compared to the deflections due to the regular component .",
    "we generated two sets of events : events from a source with a @xmath49 injection spectrum that we propagated from the source to the earth , and events from some background generated according to the hires spectrum and the telescope array exposure .",
    "we mixed both sets of events , tried to detect the source and checked how often we got confused by detecting some background .",
    "+ we showed that one should look for doublets of events with @xmath17ev , when using the depicted method .",
    "+ we studied in section  [ sectiondependance ] the dependence on several parameters : unknown parameters from the magnetic fields , the source , the sky anisotropy at high energies and the experimental statistics .",
    "we showed in section  [ sectionreconstruction ] that with the parameters and assumptions adopted here , the precision on the source reconstruction would be dominated by the current experimental angular resolution in 68% of cases .",
    "the local deflection power can be known up to 25% in 68% of cases .",
