    "solutions of highly - charged polyelectrolytes , such as biopolymers ( dna , proteins , _ etc . _ ) and many synthetic polyelectrolytes , exhibit striking phenomena while multivalent salts or charged molecules are added into the solutions  @xcite .",
    "if the concentration of the added salt lies within a window of concentration , the solution is separated in two phases : one is a viscous phase containing condensed or precipitated polyelectrolytes , and the other is a dilute phase in which polyelectrolytes are dissolved .",
    "if it lies outside the window , the solution is in a homogeneous phase .",
    "these phenomena are called `` reentrant condensation ''  @xcite , or commonly referred as `` dna condensation '' in the fields of biology and medicine  @xcite .",
    "this topic has attracted much attention recently due to its potential application in developing nonviral vectors of dna for the purpose of gene therapy  @xcite .",
    "the amount of salt which results in the phase separation is determined by many factors , such as valence of salt , temperature , chain structure , and concentration of polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the lower boundary of the window depends linearly on the concentration of polyelectrolytes but the upper one of the window is insensitive to it and roughly a constant .",
    "both flexible polyelectrolytes and stiff polyelectrolytes display similar phase diagrams  @xcite .    despite decades of effort ,",
    "our understanding on polyelectrolytes is still limited and many issues , including the reentrant condensation , are far from being resolved  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of polyelectrolytes in salt solutions by means of computer simulations .",
    "there have been many simulations devoted to the study of polyelectrolytes  @xcite . however , most of them investigated the properties in salt - free solutions  @xcite . only recently ,",
    "due to the progress of computing power , large - scale simulations for systems with added salt can be realized .",
    "the works included , for example , flexible chains in monovalent or multivalent salt solutions  @xcite , semiflexible chains with multivalent salt or charged molecules  @xcite , and rigid chains in the presence of multivalent salts  @xcite .",
    "but the salt concentration or the salt valence was not large enough to observe any significant evidence being able to connect to the redissolution of polyelectrolytes . therefore , the reentrant condensation could not be discussed thoroughly in these works .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently studied the effective interaction between two immobile dnas in the presence of tetravalent counterions .",
    "they have found that the effective interaction yields an attractive minimum at short distances which then disappears in favor of a shallow minimum at large separations , indicating the occurrence of dna condensation and redissolution and a novel stable mesocrystal . in a more recent study  @xcite , we have investigated the properties of mobile polyelectrolytes in tetravalent salt solutions and demonstrated that following a collapsed transition , polyelectrolytes undergo reexpanding transition upon addition of the salt .",
    "this phenomenon is just a single - chain version of the condensation and the redissolution of polyelectrolytes .",
    "moreover , by varying the ion size , we have shown that the excluded volume of ions plays a decisive role on the reentrant condensation .",
    "however , to well understand the phenomena , there is still a far way to go .",
    "for example , is it possible to obtain any information related to the phase boundary of reentrant condensation from simulations ?",
    "there exist theories to explain the phase boundary  @xcite but it has never been studied in simulations . concerning the size of polyelectrolyte in multivalent salts , muthukumar and coworkers have applied single and double screening theories to explain the collapsed transition of chains  @xcite .",
    "however , no existing theory can predict chain reexpansion in the region of high salt concentration . moreover , chain morphology is essential to understand the properties of polyelectrolytes .",
    "it can be described by many quantities , such as asphericity and prolateness parameter  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no such study has been reported yet for strongly - charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "an alternative way to understand polymers is to study scaling behavior .",
    "although the concept of scaling has been successfully applied to neutral polymers  @xcite , application of this concept to polyelectrolytes  @xcite has encountered many difficulties owing to the long - range nature of coulomb interaction . in this paper , we compute the single - chain structure factor .",
    "the swelling exponent is then calculated by studying the power - law - like regime of the structure factor .",
    "since properties of polyelectrolytes depend strongly on ion size , we investigate in this paper the effect of ion size too . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , the sizes of ions were set to identical and varied simultaneously . as a consequence , bjerrum association  @xcite",
    "was strongly intervened , particularly when ions were small .",
    "this setup has a disadvantage that the system was easily jammed by large ions , leading to the impossibility of investigation of the cases of big ions .",
    "therefore , in this study we vary only the size of the multivalent counterions and fix unchanged the one of the other ions , so that the ion size effect is restrictedly investigated .    in the study of polyelectrolytes , it is tempting to discuss the long range nature of coulomb interaction using the concept of electrostatic persistence length .",
    "odijk  @xcite , skolnick and fixman  @xcite predicted that the electrostatic persistence length is proportional to the square of the screening length @xmath0 .",
    "the deduction was based upon debye - hckel theory .",
    "consequently , the effective intramolecular interaction is always repulsive , resulting in a positive electrostatic persistence length  @xcite .",
    "however , experiments have shown that electrostatic persistence length can be negative under certain condition so that electrostatics gives a reversed contribution to chain flexibility  @xcite .",
    "simulations on this issue  @xcite were mainly performed within debye - hckel approximation using a screened coulomb potential @xmath1 to describe the screening effect of salt without involving explicitly salt ions . a negative electrostatic persistence length ,",
    "hence , has never been reproduced in the simulations .",
    "noticeably , it is known that linear screening theory is valid only for a weakly - charged system and breaks down for a highly - charged one , such as dna and many biopolymers , due to strong ion correlations  @xcite . recently , by employing a loop expansion method which goes beyond mean field , ariel and andelman were able to predict the negative regime of the electrostatic persistence length for a strongly - charged rodlike polyelectrolyte  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that to observe a negative electrostatic persistence length , one should incorporate salt ions explicitly and use the bare coulomb potential in simulations .",
    "our study fulfills this requirement and hence offer a good chance to verify the above phenomenon and theory .",
    "charge inversion is a universal phenomenon , occurred when a strongly charged macroion binds so many counterions that its net charge alters sign  @xcite .",
    "_ intended to link charge inversion with the reentrant condensation of polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
    "the idea was based upon that counterions form strongly correlated liquid on the surface of polyelectrolytes . in an intermediate salt region , the bare charges of the chains are almost neutralized by the condensed counterions ; the correlation - induced attraction results in the condensation of polyelectrolytes . in a high - salt region ,",
    "the counterions overcompensate the chain bare charges ; coulomb repulsion between chains dominates the attraction and , in consequence , the condensates are redissolved into the solution .",
    "solis and olvera de la cruz gave a different point of view using a theory called `` two - state model ''  @xcite .",
    "they predicted that charge inversion is not necessarily occurred with redissolution of polyelectrolytes .",
    "although overcompensated by counterions , the redissolved polyelectrolytes can have either sign due to the association of coions  @xcite .",
    "this association depends strongly on the ion size which was not considered in the study of nguyen _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "therefore , solis and olvera de la cruz predicted a charge distribution which oscillates from a polyelectrolyte , in accordance with the profile observed in our previous work  @xcite . in this paper , we investigate more extreme cases , including much smaller and much larger ions .",
    "we also study like - charge attraction between chains by calculating the potential of mean force and determine the conditions under which the attraction takes place .",
