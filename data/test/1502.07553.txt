    "the isolation of single - layer and few - layer graphene has triggered a huge burst of interest , mainly motivated by the observation of unconventional electronic properties , which stem from the dirac - like low - energy electronic structure of graphene characterized by a gapless conical dispersion [ ] .",
    "the huge electronic mobility of free - standing graphene originates from its chiral properties , tightly linked with the lack of electron backscattering phenomena near the fermi level [ ] .",
    "a drawback of this characteristic band structure is the absence of an energy gap between the dirac cones , which would be highly desirable for the exploitation of graphene in device applications .",
    "so far , however , the effective employment of graphene - based materials in low - energy electronics has been hindered by the difficulty of opening a bandgap without affecting the electronic mobility .",
    "understanding the fundamental mechanisms responsible of gap opening in graphene is thus of the highest importance in the perspective of engineering new efficient switch on / off devices .    from the theoretical point of view , the simplest way to open a gap in the conical dirac - like dispersion of a two - dimensional honeycomb material",
    "is to induce an inequivalence between the two carbon sublattices a and b. this corresponds to include a @xmath0 term in the dirac - like hamiltonian : @xmath1 + \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_z , \\label{hgap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the dirac velocity , @xmath3 is the momentum relative to the k point , and where @xmath4 are @xmath5 pauli matrices defined in the subspace of the two carbon orbitals for unit cell .",
    "the term @xmath6 represents an energy off - shift of the dirac point due to finite doping .",
    "the total dispersion results thus : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . note that this model predicts for small @xmath3 a parabolic behavior @xmath9 for both conduction and valence bands with an effective mass @xmath10 proportional to the band gap @xmath11 : @xmath12 . in order to highlight the strict relation between the gap opening and the onset of an effective mass",
    ", we define this scenario as `` massive '' ( ms ) gap model , in contrast with a `` massless '' ( ml ) gap model that we will discuss below",
    ". it should be worth to note , in addition , that , in the massive gap model , the band dispersion recovers a standard linear behavior ( @xmath13 ) for @xmath14 , so that the extrapolation of the upper band dispersion overlaps the lower band and vice versa .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is one of the most direct experimental techniques that allow to investigate the energy - momentum dependence of the electronic states in solids .",
    "although arpes can be applied also to suspended graphene , as recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "[ ] , it is more often applied to study the electronic structure of supported graphene .",
    "when graphene is in contact with a solid material finite doping effects , as well as modifications ( screening ) of the many - body interactions , are observed .",
    "gap opening is frequently reported , with magnitudes that depend on the growth process and on the substrate [ ] .",
    "these observations are commonly interpreted in term of the massive model discussed above . at a closer look ,",
    "however , the actual evidence of such physical behavior in most of the cases is not assessed .",
    "a first issue regards the effective opening of a gap in some epitaxially grown graphene samples , where a spectral anomaly at the dirac point was shown to be associated with the signature of plasmaronic subbands rather than with a simple gap opening [ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "arpes data for other supported graphene layers do not show the characteristic `` diamond - shaped '' dispersion of the plasmaron at the dirac point [ ] . even in these cases , however , the actual experimental band dispersion presents many inconsistencies with the simple massive dirac gap model , pointing thus towards different mechanism of gap opening .    the arpes data of ref .",
    "[ ] , for instance , reported a gap @xmath15 ev which was initially discussed in terms of the massive gap model , and critically revised in ref .",
    "two main unconventional features were there pointed out in regards to the arpes data : ( @xmath16 ) in spite of a large gap opening , the conduction and valence bands in ref . [ ] retained a conical shape , in contrast with the expected parabolic behavior ; ( @xmath17 ) the linear extrapolation of the upper and lower bands appeared to be _ misaligned _ , with an energy shift corresponding to the gap .    in order to account for these unconventional features ,",
    "an alternative scenario was proposed in ref .",

    "this phenomenological model was also shown to provide precise predictions ( e.g. on the density of states ) which could be experimentally checked [ ] .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "on one hand we would like to provide experimental evidence of the validity of the massless gap model in cvd grown graphene . on the other hand we discuss in details at the theoretical level the possibility of the appearing of a massless gap as result of a tendency towards a second - order phase transition .",
    "we believe that a full understanding and controlling of the unconventional properties of the massless gap in graphene on substrates can open new perspectives in the bandgap engineering in graphene - based materials .",
    "before addressing a quantitative analysis of the experimental arpes dispersion , and a deeper discussion about the possible origin of the anomalous bandgap features there observed , we summarize briefly here the comparison between the massive and massless gap models .",
    "we first write the non - interacting hamiltonian in the form : @xmath21 where @xmath3 are the momenta relative to the k point .",
    "the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , @xmath22 , describe the dirac cone dispersion , while the non - trivial dependence of ( [ h0 ] ) on the angle @xmath23 accounts for the chiral properties of the eigenstates .",
    "a massive gap is induced if the a and b sublattices are electrostatically inequivalent , for instance as an effect of the substrate .",
    "such inequivalence is formally taken into account by the additional term @xmath24 as in eq .",
    "( [ hgap ] ) , resulting in the well - known dispersion @xmath25 two regimes can be identified in this energy dispersion . at high - energies ( @xmath26 )",
    "the effect of the gap is negligible and the band dispersion recovers the normal linear behavior @xmath13 . at low - energies ( @xmath27 ) the band acquires a parabolic shape @xmath28 $ ] , with @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that in this regime the chiral structure of the band dispersion is strongly affected by the opening of the gap [ ] .",
    "the onset of a massive gap in the low - energy electronic structure of graphene has been discussed not only as due to the interaction with the substrate , but also as a possible effect of a spontaneous excitonic instability induced by the long - range coulomb interaction [ ] . in this latter context",
    ", the term ( [ gap ] ) should be regarded as an _ order parameter _ , rather than an intrinsic property of the system .",
    "for real graphene systems , however , the dimensionless coulomb coupling constant results to be much smaller than the critical value required for the excitonic instability . on the other hand , in the absence of such excitonic broken symmetry , in the normal state the long - range coulomb interaction has been shown to be accounted , at the leading order , by a self - energy term [ ] : @xmath29    note here the much weaker dependence on @xmath30 , than the bare dirac hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , the conventional linear behavior in @xmath30 is here counterbalanced by a logarithmic divergence @xmath31 induced by the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "note finally that in this case the chiral structure is preserved down to @xmath32 .    the massless gap model investigated in this paper , alternative to the massive model described by eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , resembles features from both ( [ gap ] ) and ( [ coulomb ] ) , and it can be mathematically described by a self - energy term [ ] : @xmath33 where the off - diagonal terms do _ not _ scale to zero for @xmath32 , but they still preserve the full chiral properties . as mentioned above , the characteristic energy - momentum dispersion results to be @xmath34 .",

    ", such anomalies can permit to identify in a clear way one gap model rather than the other one in the experimental data .",
    "in this section we present a detailed analysis of some recent arpes measurements on single - layer graphene on ir(111 ) decorated by ir clusters and na alkali metals .",
    "we show how these measurements display , in correspondence with the opening of a large energy gap [ ] , an anomalous behavior of the dirac cones compatible with the massless gap model .",
    "the experiment was performed at the vuv - photoemission beamline on the elettra storage ring in trieste under ultrahigh vacuum conditions .",
    "the ir(111 ) crystal was cleaned by cycles of ar@xmath35 ion sputtering and annealing at @xmath36 k. surface order and cleanliness of the sample were checked by low - energy electron diffraction and core level photoemission measurements .",
    "graphene was grown by thermal cracking of ethylene ( c@xmath37h@xmath38 ) on the ir substrate held at 1300 k for an exposure of 100 l ( 1l corresponds to an exposure of @xmath39 mbar for 1s ) . under these experimental conditions , graphene had lattice vectors aligned in plane to those of the substrate and displayed a moir pattern originating from the interface lattice mismatch [ ] .",
    "tiny ir amounts were evaporated from a current heated thin film plate ( @xmath40 mm width , @xmath41 mm thickness ) at an evaporation rate of about @xmath42 ml / s , as determined by core level photoemission measurements [ ] .",
    "ir evaporation was performed at a temperature of 350 k. the deposition of ir results in the nucleation of size selected ir clusters on the hcp regions of the moir supercells ( see fig .",
    "[ f - sketch ] for a schematic sketch ) [ ] .",
    "the process was finely controlled to saturate the hcp regions of the moir - derived graphene supercells with one ir cluster and to avoid cluster percolation .",
    "the optimal ir coverage was determined to be 0.15 ml ( monolayer ) ir , with reference to the density of an ir(111 ) plane [ ] .",
    "additional na was evaporated from a commercial getter source at room temperature and adsorbed to fill the residual exposed graphene surface .",
    "the resulting system ( na / ir / g ) was characterized by means of angle - resolved photoemission , as reported in ref . [ ] .",
    "the valence band photoemission analysis was carried out by a scienta r4000 electron energy analyzer with @xmath43 ev photons , close to the cooper minimum of the ir5d levels .",
    "the spectra were collected at 120 k with energy and angular resolution of 30 mev and 0.3@xmath44 , respectively .    the arpes intensity map , along the direction perpendicular to @xmath45k passing through the k point ( p@xmath45k ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - map]a , where the white and green symbols represent the position of the maxima in the energy - distribution - curves ( edcs ) and in the momentum - distribution - curves ( mdcs ) , respectively .",
    "the fermi momentum along the p@xmath45k direction is @xmath46 @xmath47 that , taking into account the trigonal warping of the bands , gives an electron doping of @xmath48 electrons per c atom . from the edc at @xmath49 we estimate a bandgap @xmath50 ev .",
    "two remarkable features stand out from the arpes data : ( @xmath16 ) both conduction and valence bands present a linear dispersion throughout the probed @xmath3-space region , except within a very small region @xmath51 @xmath47 .",
    "this range is thus much smaller than that predicted by the massive gap model ( @xmath52 @xmath47 ) ; ( @xmath17 ) the linear extrapolations of the upper and lower branched do not match , at variance with the expectations of the massive gap model .",
    "we note additionally the lack of any diamond - like features close to the k point , which would be typical trademarks of plasmaronic coupling [ ] . on the other hand , plasmaron signatures in arpes data have been so far reported only for epitaxial graphene on sic , whereas they are absent in graphene grown on metallic substrates , most probably as a consequence of screening effects .",
    "such band structure of the na / ir / g system appears to be incompatible with the standard massive gap model , whereas they could be naturally reproduced within the context of the massless gap model .    in order to address at a more quantitative level this issue ,",
    "we provide here a detailed careful analysis of the arpes data for na / ir / g . before testing the different models ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate the basic parameters which are _ independent _ of the model itself , e.g. the fermi velocity @xmath2 and the the dirac energy @xmath6 in the absence of the gap .",
    "we estimate @xmath53 from the linear behavior of the lower band in the energy window from @xmath54 ev to @xmath55 ev , which yields @xmath56 ev /  .",
    "this value is consistent with the speed value derived from the upper band .",
    "we found this value was also perfectly compatible with the linear slope of the upper band . a rough estimate @xmath57 ev of the dirac energy in the absence of the gap",
    "is obtained as the midgap point at @xmath49 ( @xmath58 ev , @xmath59 ev ) .",
    "this estimate can be cross - checked with the average energy between the upper and lower band @xmath60 for generic @xmath3 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ f - map]b .",
    "the result shows a negligible momentum dependence , resulting in @xmath61 ev .",
    "note that the negligible dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath3 signalizes an almost perfect symmetry of the experimental upper and lower bands with respect to the dirac energy .",
    "this is compatible with both the massless and massive gap models , but it rules out plasmaronic effects which would result in an asymmetry and in a finite @xmath3 dependence of @xmath62 .",
    "the unbiased determination of @xmath6 and @xmath2 allows to test the validity of the different models on the experimental data .",
    "[ f - disp ] compares the band dispersion extracted from the momentum and energy distribution curves with the prediction of massless and massive modes .",
    "the best agreement is found for the massless model with @xmath63 ev .",
    "note the mismatch between the upper and lower dirac cones , that reproduce perfectly the experimental data .",
    "the same value of the gap can be indeed also inferred from such misalignment . on the other hand ,",
    "no satisfactory fit was possible for the massive model .",
    "we show here thus the predictions of the massive model for @xmath64 ev , that reproduces the value at k of the upper and lower bands .",
    "in the previous section we have shown how a careful analysis of the band anomalies observed by arpes in in na / ir / g points out towards a phenomenology of the graphene bands compatible more with massless gap model rather than with the standard massive one .",
    "it is clear that the different models represent a trademark for different underlying physical processes . in this section",
    "we address thus this issue , in order to clarify which kind of physical processes can be responsible at the microscopic level for the massless dirac phenomenology , with the final aim to control and engineering such processes .    along this perspective",
    ", a brief summary of the microscopic physics related to the massive model can be useful . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the massive dirac model essentially stems from the presence of a local potential term @xmath0 which makes the two carbon atom sublattices inequivalent .",
    "this potential can be naturally induced by the interaction of graphene with the substrate .",
    "the term @xmath65 in the hamiltonian appears then as an _ external _ field arising from the environment .",
    "alternatively , the onset of a mass term @xmath66 has been discussed within the context of a spontaneous symmetry breaking , where the driving mechanism is the unscreened long - range coulomb interaction [ ] .",
    "the term @xmath67 can be viewed thus in this scenario as an anomalous _ self - energy _",
    "term , i.e. as an _ order parameter _ , arising from many - body effects .",
    "it should be however mentioned that in this case the mass term @xmath68 appears to be momentum dependent , i.e. divergent for @xmath69 [ ] , rather than @xmath3-independent .    from a general point of view , since the presence of a linear dirac cone in ideal flat graphene is dictated by symmetry reasons , it is clear that the opening of a gap and the splitting of the upper and lower bands , both in the massive and in the massless model , must be associated with some kind of breaking symmetry .",
    "we have indeed just seen how the symmetry breaking ( spontaneous or not ) responsible for the massive model is the equivalence between the local potentials of the two sublattices . in ref .",
    "[ ] the general constraints that a phenomenological self - energy must satisfied to give rise to a massless dirac model have been discussed .",
    "it is on the other hand intriguing to discuss in the present work the conditions that could make possible the appearance of a self - energy ( [ less ] ) as result of a tendency towards a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it is clear that the effective breaking of symmetry , in real materials , can be prevented by many causes .",
    "for instance , as we will discuss below , a good candidate for a quasi - breaking of symmetry is the long - range coulomb interaction . in real materials , and in particular in na / ir / graphene",
    ", such interaction is expected to be screened resulting in a cut - off of the singular behavior for small exchange momenta @xmath70 .",
    "asymptotically , this should correspond to `` regularization '' of the interaction , and thus to a linear behavior of the dispersion ( although with a very steep slope ) for momenta @xmath3 close to the k point . for larger",
    "@xmath3 , however , the tendency towards an instability can still be reflected in a quasi - gapped dispersion which can be compatible with the experimental observations . from this point of view",
    ", we present the analysis of the onset of a spontaneous symmetry breaking just as an illustrative example for the gross features of the resulting phenomenology . in similar way , we do not want to provide here a quantitative evaluation of the possible critical couplings required to induce a massless gapped case , rather to compare , at a qualitative level , this strength of this instability with the strength of the corresponding instability associated with the spontaneous generation of a mass according the model ( [ hgap ] ) . in order to have thus a direct and clear way to compare the two possible instabilities , we address here this issue within the context of a mean - field solution , keeping in mind that a more compelling high - order analysis is needed for a quantitative investigation .    in order to address this issue in the most convenient way",
    ", we introduce the nambu notation where the hamiltonian of ideal free - standing graphene can be written as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a global index taking into account both spin and valley ( degenerate ) degrees of freedom @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 is the spinor in the sublattice basis @xmath76 , and where @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we assume a long - range coulomb interaction which can we written in the momentum space as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and where @xmath80/\\epsilon_0 \\kappa   |{\\bf q}|$ ] . the term @xmath81 $ ] in @xmath82 takes into account the subtraction of the positive charged background , while @xmath83 is the dimensionless relative in - plane dielectric constant .",
    "the phenomenology of the normal state self - energy arising from such many - body interaction , as well as of several possible _ anomalous _ self - energies associated with different spontaneous symmetry breaking , has been discussed in an extended way using different accurate techniques , as for instance renormalization group ( rg ) or static random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "in general , in order to have an accurate estimate of the _ magnitude _ of the corresponding self - energies ( and of the minimum strength of the interaction in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , a self - consistent screening of the quasi - particle excitations and of the the effective screened coulomb interaction is required .      neglecting the hartree term , which does not play any role in the present context , and focusing on the exchange ( fock ) term , we can write the generic self - energy as : @xmath84 note that , since the interaction @xmath82 is peaked at small @xmath85 , the intra - valley scattering is dominant , supporting the validity of the low - energy model versus a full tight - binding treatment .",
    "note also that at this level of approximation ( unscreened static coulomb interaction ) the self - energy does not depend on the frequency @xmath86 . within this scheme is thus convenient to define an effective mean - field hamiltonian @xmath87 , and to write a recursive equation : @xmath88    since @xmath89 depends on the angular variables @xmath90 , @xmath91 essentially through only @xmath92 , one can see that @xmath93 .",
    "apart numerical prefactor , the momentum dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath30 can be caught already by a perturbative analysis . replacing @xmath95 with @xmath96 in the right side term of eq .",

    "note that , within this context , the self - energy associated with the massless gap model is formally described by @xmath103const .",
    "i.e. by @xmath104 .",
    "it is clear that such analytical dependence is not spontaneously generated by the self - consistent solution of ( [ heff ] ) in the normal state , and it must be regarded as an order parameter of a possible second order phase transition . in order to address this possibility , we rewrite eq .",

    "we should stress that such value of @xmath132 has been derived within the lowest order approximation , and a more compelling analysis is needed for a reliable quantitative estimate .",
