    "computer simulations of core collapse supernovae are currently at the forefront of research in astro- , nuclear and computational physics . as one - dimensional simulations usually fail to explode @xcite , the challenging question is whether core - collapse supernovae require multidimensional effects like convection , rotation or magnetic fields , or whether the microphysics input into the simulations is still insufficient or incorrect .",
    "the latter possibility involves nuclear physics ingredients like stellar electron and @xmath3-decay rates @xcite , neutrino - nucleus reactions @xcite , neutrino opacities in nuclear matter @xcite and the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "an essential part of the eos is the symmetry energy which describes the energy needed to separate protons and neutrons .",
    "the special importance of the symmetry energy for the core collapse of a massive star stems from the fact that the dynamical evolution of the collapse is strongly influenced by electron captures on nuclei and free protons .",
    "these captures drive the matter in the core towards successively more neutron - rich nuclei@xcite . the symmetry energy impacts these electron captures in two essential ways . for finite nuclei ,",
    "the effectiveness of the capture depends on the magnitude of the symmetry energy @xmath4 ; i.e. the larger the value of @xmath4 the more difficult it is to change protons into neutrons . furthermore , via the eos the symmetry energy influences the amount of free protons in the core composition which in the late stage of the collapse are believed to be the dominant source for electron captures @xcite .    as part of global nuclear mass formulae",
    ", the symmetry energy is conventionally parametrized as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the neutron , charge and mass number of a nucleus .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath8 can be determined by fit to the observed nuclear masses . for the application of the symmetry energy in core - collapse supernovae simulations , donati _ et al .",
    "_ pointed to a possible temperature dependence of the @xmath8 coefficient @xcite which at the finite temperatures of the stellar collapse has been estimated to be somewhat larger than for stable nuclei ( @xmath9 ) hindering electron captures .",
    "the hypothesis is based on the following chain of arguments @xcite . on the mean - field level correlations",
    "are successfully accounted for by using an effective mass parameter @xmath10 rather than the bare nucleon mass @xmath11 . here",
    ", the k - mass @xmath12 simulates spatial non - localities in the hartree - fock potential introduced by the pauli principle .",
    "furthermore , the ground state mean field is found to be highly dynamical with strong coupling to surface vibrations .",
    "the non - localities associated with these surface couplings can be absorbed into the so - called @xmath13-mass @xmath14 .",
    "this mass is found to be @xmath15 m. however , as it is related to vibrations at low excitation energies of a few mev , donati _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that @xmath14 should vary over the temperature range involved in the collapse phase of a supernova @xmath16 mev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical energy scale of @xmath12 is @xmath17 mev so that variations of @xmath12 with temperature are assumed to be small and unimportant during the collapse @xcite . within the fermi gas model ,",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath4 depends , via its kinetic part , on the change of the @xmath13-mass which scales like @xmath18 .",
    "hence , a reduction of @xmath14 with temperature increases the symmetry energy .",
    "et al . _ supported their arguments by calculations of selected even - even nuclei at finite temperature using the framework of the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "clearly nuclear excitations at low energies also depend on correlations beyond those treated on the qrpa level .",
    "the model of choice for a realistic description of these correlations ( e.g. pairing , 2-particle-2-hole and higher order correlations ) is the nuclear shell model . until recently ,",
    "such shell model calculations for the nuclei involved in core - collapse supernovae were impractical due to the prohibitively large model spaces .",
    "this shortcoming has been overcome by modern shell model developments @xcite , where the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) technique also allows such large - scale calculations at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "a first attempt to study the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy within the smmc has been reported in @xcite , finding no evidence for an increase of @xmath4 with temperature . however",
    ", this calculation , performed for nuclei with @xmath19 using the kb3 residual interaction @xcite , has been made more difficult by the ` g - extrapolation procedure ' @xcite required to circumvent the notorious sign - problem in smmc studies with realistic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the model space considered ( full @xmath20 shell ) was probably too small for calculations at temperatures higher than about @xmath21 mev .",
    "we were thus motivated to perform improved smmc studies of the temperature dependence of @xmath4 . to this end",
    ", we adopted a significantly larger model space , now also including the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals ; these orbitals become important especially as @xmath7 becomes larger than 65 .",
    "we also adopted a schematical but still reasonable residual interaction of the pairing+quadrupole type",
    ". such an interaction does not give rise to the sign problem @xcite and allows for a determination of observables at finite temperature without employing the g - extrapolation , thus reducing the statistical uncertainties of the results .",
    "the smmc method has been presented in great detail in @xcite .",
    "the smmc technique describes nuclear observables @xmath24 at finite temperature as thermal averages @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes the many - body trace at fixed particle number @xmath7 ( in this case at fixed neutron and proton numbers ) and @xmath28 the many - body propagator . applying the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ,",
    "the components of @xmath28 stemming from the two - body parts of the hamiltonian ( related to the residual interaction ) are transformed into integrals over many one - body propagators involving fluctuating external fields .",
    "the necessary integrations are performed by monte carlo sampling techniques . for certain classes of residual interactions like the attractive pairing+quadrupole force employed here ,",
    "the evaluation of @xmath24 is exact , subject only to statistical errors related to the monte carlo integrations .",
    "as mentioned above , our smmc calculations are performed within the complete @xmath29 model space .",
    "the single particle energies have been determined from a woods - saxon potential parametrization of @xmath30ni . as we are concerned here with a description of collective correlations at low energies ,",

    "the one - body potential @xmath42 is of the woods - saxon form @xcite .",
    "we averaged contributions of the proton and neutron radial integrals to the quadrupole reduced matrix elements . using the parameters @xmath43  mev and @xmath44  mev@xmath45@xmath46 , we reproduce the collective spectrum in @xmath47ni and @xmath47ge . we have checked that center - of - mass contaminations are very small and",
    "do not affect our results .",
    "our smmc calculations have been performed with 4096 statistical samples , splitting the temperature parameter @xmath3 into @xmath48 slices with @xmath49 mev@xmath45 ( for details see @xcite ) .    besides collective excitations , nuclei in the mass range @xmath50 , as encountered in the early stage of the core collapse , can be strongly influenced by pairing and shell correlations due to the vicinity of the @xmath51 magic number .",
    "all of these modes are governed by energy scales of order @xmath52 mev , and hence are expected to change in the temperature range of interest . to explore the influence of the various correlations on the nuclear properties and their temperature dependence",

    "we now turn to a calculation of the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy using our smmc results . in the absence of pairing and shell correlations ,",
    "one expects the energy expectation value of isobars , i.e. for nuclei with constant @xmath73 , to scale like @xmath58 . to minimize the differences in pairing and shell correlation energies we choose several isobaric pairs with the same pairing structure ( i.e. even - even , odd - odd , odd-@xmath7 ) and mainly involving nuclei off the shell closure at @xmath51 .",

    "our smmc calculations are consistent with an increase of the symmetry energy with temperature , supporting the argumentation of donati _",
    "et al._. in concluding , we explore the possible consequences for the supernova collapse .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite the larger symmetry energy at finite temperature will result in less electron captures and larger homologous cores , provided all other inputs are kept unchanged . however , here we like to add a word of caution . at first , we note that the recent stellar weak interaction rates @xcite are based on shell model calculations performed in model spaces large enough to describe nuclear correlations and their changes with temperature properly for the temperature regime relevant for presupernova simulations @xcite .",
    "these calculations described the stellar weak - interaction processes for nuclei up to mass @xmath92 as they dominate the mass composition in the core of a collapsing star up to densities of order @xmath93 g/@xmath94 .",
    "as the continuous electron captures drive the matter more neutron - rich during the collapse , nuclei heavier than @xmath92 become important and even dominate at higher densities . for these nuclei ,",
    "diagonalization shell model calculations similar to those performed in @xcite , are not feasible due to computational restrictions . to evaluate the relevant electron capture rates for these nuclei ,",
    "a hybrid model has recently been suggested @xcite . in this model",
    "the capture rates are calculated within an rpa approach with partial occupation formalism , including allowed and forbidden transitions .",
    "the partial occupation numbers represent an ` average ' state of the parent nucleus and depend on temperature .",
    "they are calculated within our current smmc approach at finite temperature . in the hybrid model",
    "the difference of neutron @xmath95 and proton @xmath96 chemical potentials are fixed by the @xmath97-value of the capture reaction , assuming that there is no temperature dependence in the symmetry energy .",
    "the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy , however , should slightly increase the @xmath98 difference . to study its relevance for the electron capture rates during the supernova collapse , we have calculated rates for three nuclei ( @xmath99zn , @xmath100ga , @xmath101kr ) which are atypical representatives of the heavy nuclei at densities @xmath102 g/@xmath94 and a few @xmath103 g/@xmath94 ( @xmath101kr ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been performed for @xmath104 , i.e. for no temperature dependence of the symmetry energy , and increasing the @xmath98 difference according to the parametrized increase of the symmetry energy given in @xcite .",
    "possible final - state blocking by neutrinos have been ignored , although this effect becomes increasingly important in actual collapse simulations at densities in excess of order @xmath103 g/@xmath94 .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ traj ] as a function of the electron chemical potential @xmath105 in the environment , calculated at five points along a typical collapse trajectory made available to us by @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath105 scales with the density as @xmath106 . at the lowest density point",
    "( @xmath107 g/@xmath94 ) , the electron chemical potential @xmath105 is of the same order as the q - value for @xmath99zn ( a representative nucleus at these conditions ) , making the capture rate sensitive to a change in @xmath98 difference .",
    "we find that the capture rate is decreased by a factor of order 3 , if the difference increases as suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xmath100ga , another nucleus present in the matter composition at these conditions , has a smaller q - value .",
    "hence , the effect of an increase in @xmath98 does affect the rate significantly less .",
    "this shows the importance which an increase of the symmetry energy with temperature in the capture rates rests on the competition between the growth of the electron chemical potential and the typical q - values of the nuclei in the matter composition along the collapse trajectory . at about @xmath103 g/@xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath105 is of order 20 mev , while typical q - values are of order 10 mev .",
    "thus , an effective change in the @xmath97-value by about @xmath108 has only little effect on the capture rate .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ traj ] where the effect of a temperature - dependent increase in the @xmath98 difference becomes less relevant with increasing density .",
    "this suggests that the proposed temperature dependence of the symmetry energy decreases the capture rate on nuclei during a small period of the collapse .",
    "the absolute changes , even during this period , appear to be rather mild so that one does not expect significant changes for the collapse trajectory .    in conclusion , we performed smmc calculations in an @xmath109-@xmath110-@xmath111-@xmath112 model space using an effective pairing+quandrupole hamiltonian .",
    "we found that the symmetry energy increases as a function of temperature by about 6% on average .",
    "when applying this symmetry change to electron captures occurring along a typical core - collapse mass trajectory , we found marginal differences in the calculated rates .",
