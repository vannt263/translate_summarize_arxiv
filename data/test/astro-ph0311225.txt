    "the be / x - ray binaries represent the largest subclass of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "about two - thirds of the identified systems fall into this category .",
    "these systems consist of , generally , a neutron star and a be star with a cool ( @xmath2 ) equatorial disc , which is geometrically thin and nearly keplerian .",
    "the orbit is wide @xmath3 and usually eccentric ( @xmath4 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the be / x - ray binaries show only transient activity in the x - ray emission and are termed be / x - ray transients .",
    "be / x - ray transients show periodical ( type i ) outbursts , which are separated by the orbital period and have the lumiocity of @xmath5 , and giant ( type ii ) outbursts of @xmath6 with no orbital modulation .",
    "the transient nature in the x - ray activity of be / x - ray binaries is considered to result from the interaction between the accreted material from the circumsteller disc of the be star and the rotating magnetized neutron star @xcite . if the accreted material is dense enough to make the magnetospheric radius smaller than the corotation radius , the accretion on to the neutron star causes a bright x - ray emission ( the direct accretion regime ) . otherwise , the magnetospheric radius is larger than the corotation radius , and the accretion is prevented by the centrifugal inhibition .",

    "these observational features strongly suggest the presence of an accretion disc during the outbursts .",
    "the accretion disc is also indicated to exist between the outbursts in several systems ( e.g. , a0535 + 26 ) ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite searched the optical / infrared contribution from the accretion disc in a0535 + 26 during the x - ray quiescent phase , and found no signature of the accretion disc in propeller regime .",
    "obviously , more work is needed to determine whether the accretion disc also exists in the quiescent state .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the interaction between the be - star disc and the neutron star , using a three - dimensional ( 3d ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they also qualitatively discussed the relation between the x - ray luminosity and the accretion rate using the simulated mass - capture rate by the neutron star . in their simulations , however , the neutron star was modelled by a sink particle @xcite with the size of the roche lobe .",
    "hence , no information was available how the captured material accretes on to the neutron star .",
    "moreover , no direct comparison with the observed x - ray data was possible .    in this paper , we study the accretion on to the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , using a 3d sph code",
    ". the simulation should ideally take account of all the processes at work in a be / x - ray binary , such as the disc evolution around the be star , the mass transfer from the be - star disc to the neutron star , and the accretion on to the neutron star .",
    "such a simulation , however , would require very intense computations .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to simulate only the accretion flow around the neutron star , with an outer boundary condition constructed by the data of the particles captured by the neutron star from a high - resolution simulation by @xcite . this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the right panel taken from their simulation shows the mass transfer from the be - star disc to the neutron star at periastron , while the left panel shows the accretion disc formed around the neutron star in one of our simulations .",
    "simulations presented here were performed with a 3d sph code .",
    "the sph code is basically the same as that used by @xcite , which is based on a version originally developed by benz ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the smoothing length is variable in time and space .",
    "the sph equation with the standard cubic - spline kernel are integrated using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator with individual time steps for each particle @xcite , which results in an enormous computational saving when a large range of dynamical time - scales are involved .",
    "in our code , the accretion flow on to the neutron star is modelled by an ensemble of gas particles , each of which has an arbitrary and negligible mass chosen to be @xmath7 with a variable smoothing length .",
    "note that the accretion flow is nonself - gravitating in our simulations . on the other hand , the be star and the neutron star",
    "are modelled by two sink particles @xcite with corresponding masses . the gas particles which fall within a specified accretion radius",
    "are accreted by the sink particles .",
    "we assume that the neutron star has the fixed accretion radius of @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "for the be star , we adopt a variable accretion radius of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the roche - lobe radius for a circular binary .",

    "these parameters are adopted to target 4u0115 + 63 , which has shown only type  ii x - ray outbursts followed by a short series of type  i x - ray outbursts @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we concentrate only on the simulations of the accretion flow on to the neutron star .",
    "this is done by constructing an outer boundary condition from the data of particles captured by the neutron star in a high - resolution simulation by @xcite , which was run for @xmath41 and finally had @xmath42 particles with @xmath43 .",
    "we first fold the data on the orbital period over @xmath44 to reduce the fluctuation noise .",

    "note that there is a strong phase - dependence in the mass - transfer rate .",
    "the peak comes slightly after the periastron passage and decreases by two orders of magnitude by apastron passage .",

    "analysing multi - wavelength long term monitoring observations of 4u0115 + 63 , @xcite found that the be star undergoes quasi - cyclic @xmath70 activity , losing and reforming its circumsteller disc .",
    "then , the mass transfer to the neutron star should vary , depending on the state of the be disc . by the time the be disc is fully developed and becomes capable of supplying mass to the neutron star , even a large accretion disc would be exhausted .",

    "this suggests an interesting possibility that the disc reachs a steady average state in a time - scale much longer than the term shown in fig .",
    "14(a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : masrad](b ) , we show the evolution of the disc radius over @xmath125 .",
    "one may expect that the disc radius gradually increases with the disc mass . from the figure",
    ", however , we note that this is the case only for @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath126 , the disc radius decreases as the disc grows .",
    "this counter - intuitive decrease in radius is related to the change in the disc eccentricity . in the early stage of disc formation , the disc / ring is highly eccentric ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model6_ss ] ) , for which the radius @xmath111 calculated by equation  ( [ eq : fitting ] ) is larger than that for a circular disc with the same disc mass . since the disc eccentricity decreases with time ,",
    "so does the disk radius . in model  1 ,",
    "the effect of the disc circularization is balanced with that of the disc growth at @xmath127 .",
    "after this epoch , the disc radius increases with the disc mass .",
    "thus , the evolution of the accretion flow around the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries involves a two - stage process , which consists of the initial developing stage and the later developed stage .",
    "[ fig : mdot_acc](a ) shows the evolution of the mass - accretion rate and the corresponding x - ray luminosity in model  1 for @xmath128 .",
    "here we calculated the x - ray luminosity by @xmath129 with the x - ray emission effciency @xmath49 for the neutron star .",
    "the thick and thin lines denote the mass - accretion rate in models  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "note that the mass - accretion rate in our simulations generally has double peaks per orbit .",
    "the first peak , which occurs at the periastron , is due to the contraction of the disc by the tidal torque of the be star , except that the peaks at periastron during the initial phase of disc formation are mainly due to the direct accretion of gas with low specific angular momentum .",
    "the second peak , which lags behind the peak in the mass - transfer rate from the be disc shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_cap ] , results from the viscous accretion of matter transferred from the be disc .",
    "the first peak could be artificial since it is related to the presence of the inner simulation boundary .",
    "the orbital modulation in the mass - accretion rate is significantly different between the developing disc and the developed disc .",
    "the first peak becomes weak as the disc developes .",
    "after the disc is fully developed , the second peak is higher than the first peak .",
    "[ fig : mdot_acc](a ) also shows that , once developed , the accretion disc in 4u0115 + 63 shows the peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath130 .",
    "this level of x - ray emission enters the transition regime ( see @xcite ) and is consistent with the observed x - ray luminosity in the quiescent state .    for comparison purpose , we present in fig .  [ fig : mdot_234 ] the evolution of the mass - accretion rate and the corresponding x - ray luminosity in models  2 - 4 for @xmath125 . the thick and thin solid lines and the thin dotted line are for models  2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we see from the figure that the accretion rate increases with increasing polytropic exponent . in models  2 ( @xmath131 ) and 3 ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the accretion rate profile has the double peaks as described above .",
    "the long - term change in the peak profiles is also similar to that in model  1 .",
    "we note that the disc in model  2 entered the stage of the developed disc at @xmath132 . on the other hand ,",
    "the disc in model  3 is at the developing stage even at @xmath133 , which is consistent with the disc structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model3 ] .",
    "in contrast to the models with low @xmath28 , the accretin rate in model  4 has a single and periodic peak per orbit , even after the disc is developed . with @xmath134 ,",
    "the pressure in the disc in model  4 is much higher than that in other models .",
    "this means that much larger viscous torque exerts on the disc in model  4 than in other models , because the viscous stress in the @xmath25-viscosity prescription is proportional to the pressure . as a result",
    ", the viscous torque dominates the tidal torque in model  4 even at periastron .",
    "this is why there is no peak at periastron and the accretion rate shows the regular orbital modulation with the amplitude much higher than in other models .",
    "it is important to note that the disc evolution and its orbital modulation is sensitive to the polytropic exponent @xmath28 .",
    "this strongly implies that the cooling effciency in the accretion disc plays an important role in the x - ray activity in be / x - ray binaries .",
    "changes in the mass flux on the magnetosphere of the neutron star determine whether the system is in the direct accretion regime or in the propeller regime . while the matter falls directly on to the neutron star in the direct accretion regime , no material accretes on to the neutron star in the propeller regime by the centrifugal inhibitation .",
    "if the magnetospheric radius @xmath135 is smaller than the corotation radius @xmath136 , the system is in the direct accretion regime , otherwise , in the propeller regime .    assuming the neutron star magnetic field as the dipole - like field , the magnetospheric radius @xmath135 , obtained by equating the magnetic field pressure of the neutron star to the ram pressure of the accreting matter from the accretion disc , is written by @xmath137",

    "[ fig : mdot_acc](b ) shows the evolution of the magnetospheric radius @xmath135 normalized by the corotation radius @xmath136 , where @xmath143 was adopted . in the figure , the thick and thin lines are for models  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "recall that these models have the same parameters except for the radius of the inner simulation boundary @xmath67 ; @xmath144 in model  1 , while @xmath145 in model  2 .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetospheric radii in both models evolve in a very similar way , despite the different inner radii .",
    "our result on the magnetospheric radius is robust in this sense .",
    "we also note from fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_acc](b ) that the ratio of the magnetospheric radius to the corotation radius , @xmath146 , varies between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "consequently , for a plausible range of @xmath139 ( @xmath149 ) , the magnetospheric radius in models with @xmath150 is almost always larger than the corotation radius so that the accretion on to the neutron star is inhibited , which is consistent with the oberved x - ray luminosity of 4u0115 + 63 in quiescence ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can see from equation  ( [ eq : magnetosphere ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_234 ] that model  4 with @xmath101 is consistent with the observed x - ray behaviour of 4u0115 + 63 only if @xmath151 . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the neutron star in model  4 enters the direct accretion regime after every peristron passage of the be star .",
    "then , the system would show regular , periodic x - ray outbursts at a level of @xmath153 , which has not been observed for 4u0115 + 63 .",
    "for the first time , we have performed numerical simulations of accretion on to the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , taking into account the phase - dependent mass transfer from the be disc .",
    "we have adopted the mass - transfer rate from a high - resolution simulation by @xcite for a coplanar system with a short period ( @xmath31 ) and moderate eccentricity @xmath1 , which targeted 4u0115 + 63 , one of the best studied be / x - ray binaries .",
    "we have found that a nearly keplerian , non - steady accretion disc is formed around the neutron star regardless of the parameters adopted .",
    "the formation of the accretion disc involves a two - stage process , which consists of the initial developing stage and the later developed stage .",
    "the disc structure shows a strong dependence on the orbital phase , because both the tidal potential and the mass - transfer rate change periodically .",
    "the disc is also significantly eccentric , because the gas particles from the be disc originally have elliptical orbits .    in 4u0115 + 63 , type  i x - ray outbursts have occurred only as a short series after occasional type  ii x - ray outbursts @xcite . except for such occasions ,",
    "the system is in the quiescent state ( @xmath154 ) @xcite .",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity estimated from our simulations corresponds to the transition regime between the direct accretion regime and the propeller regime and is consistent with the observed x - ray behaviour .",
    "note , however , that the discussion based on the x - ray luminosity estimated from the simulations only gives the necessary condition for the quiescent state .    in order to see whether our model satisfies a more stringent condition ,",
    "we also have estimated the magnetospheric radius by using a general formula with the mass - accretion rate from our simulations and compared with the corotation radius for 4u0115 + 63 .",
    "the result was that our models with @xmath150 are consistent with the observed x - ray behaviour .",
    "other models with @xmath101 and @xmath155 were ruled out , because in these models the system would show an x - ray outburst after every periastron passage , which has never been observed .",
    "we have to admit , however , that the radius of our inner simulation boundary is about 60 - 100 times as large as the corotation radius of the neutron star in 4u0115 + 63 . to make the constraint on the system parameters more reliable",
    ", we need numerical simulations with a much smaller inner boundary .",
    "it is important to note that our model is not only consistent with the quiescent state of 4u0115 + 63 .",
    "it can also give a natural explanation for a short series of type  i x - ray outbursts after occasional type  ii x - ray outbursts .",
    "the mass - transfer rate from the be disc in the x - ray outbursts is likely much higher than in the quiescent state .",
    "suppose that the mass - transfer rate from the be disc in 4u0115 + 63 is temporarily increased by an order of magnitude .",
    "then , the estimated x - ray luminosity in our model increases by an order of magnitude to a level of several @xmath156 , a typical x - ray luminosity of type  i x - ray outbursts . at the same time , the magnetosphric radius @xmath135 decreases by a factor of about two , for which @xmath135 is almost always smaller than the corotation radius , @xmath136 , if @xmath152 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mdot_acc](b ) ) .",
    "this means that the system is in the direct accretion regime .",
    "thus , our model explains the type  i x - ray outbursts in 4u0115 + 63 as a temporal phenomena with an enhanced mass - transfer from the be disc .",
    "be / x - ray binaries are distributed over a wide range of orbital periods @xmath157 and eccentricities @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to consider here the effects of orbital parameters . in this paper",
    ", we have seen that the main ingredients which determines the x - ray behaviour of a system are the viscous time - scale relative to the orbital period and the mass - transfer rate from the be disc .",
    "since the former is insensitive to the orbital period itself ( see equation  ( [ eq : tratio ] ) ) , the latter is most important if the viscosity parameter and the equation of state are similar in accretion discs of be / x - ray binaries .    in systems with @xmath159 , the viscous time - scale in an outer part of the accretion disc is much longer than the orbital period unless the cooling is ineffective and the gas obeys an adiabatic equation of state . in these systems , persistent accretion discs are expected to form .",
    "then , the mass - transfer rate from the be disc determines whether the system shows type  i x - ray outbursts .",
    "for example , for a system with a moderate orbital eccentricity of @xmath160 and a typical density of be disc , the peak mass - transfer rate is @xmath161 , for which the system stays in quiescence .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the situation should be different in systems with much higher rate of mass - transfer .",
    "a high mass - transfer rate is expected to result from a high orbital eccentricity and/or an intrinsically dense be disc .",
    "therefore , it is not strange that many systems which have regularly shown type  i x - ray outbursts have orbital eccentricities higher than that of 4u0115 + 63 studied in this paper . in a subsequent paper , we will perform numerical simulations of accretion in systems with high orbital eccentricities .",
    "above we have assumed that the viscous time - scale is much longer than the orbital period in all be / x - ray binaries .",
    "however , it is possible that an accretion disc has a relatively short viscous time - scale by some reason .",
    "one possibility is that the disc has a low cooling efficiency and becomes hot , particularly in an inner region .",
    "our model  4 with @xmath101 gives an extreme example of such discs ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : chardisc ] ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_234 ] , in a system with a short viscous time - scale , the mass - accretion rate has a high and sharp peak shortly after every periastron passage .",
    "the resemblance between the accretion rate profile in model  4 and the x - ray light curves of regular type  i x - ray outbursts from systems such as exo2030 + 375 @xcite implies that these are systems with relatively short viscous time - scales .",
    "be / x - ray binaries are an ideal group of objects for studying the physics of accretion under the circumstances which have been studied little . unlike close binaries ,",
    "many be / x - ray binaries have eccentric orbits .",
    "they can also be highly inclined systems .",
    "such systems provide us a valuable oppotunity to study the effects of the periodically - changing tidal potential and mass - transfer rate and the inclination angle on the structure and evolution of the accretion flow .",
    "another important characteristic of be / x - ray binaries is that they are systems with double circumstellar discs ( the be disc and the accretion disc ) .",
    "the interaction in such systems is threefold : the interactions between the neutron star and the be disc , the be star and the accretion disc and the be disc and the accretion disc ( mainly via the mass transfer ) .",
    "much more work is desirable both theoretically and observationally in order to understand this interesting and important group of objects .",
