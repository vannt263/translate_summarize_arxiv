    "the observed pulses from pulsars are interpreted as an emission beam , fixed relative to the rotating neutron star , sweeping across the earth .",
    "the magnetospheric emission - region structure , the viewing angle with respect to the rotation axis and the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes define the shape of the observed pulse profile .",
    "pulsar radio emission is generally thought to originate within a few percent of the light - cylinder radius ( @xmath5 ) above the polar caps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many pulsars exhibit a `` radius - to - frequency '' mapping @xcite which is indicative of polar cap emission .",
    "the increasing pulse width at lower radio frequencies is interpreted as emission at increasing heights above the poles along more widely directed field lines .",
    "the radio profiles of many young pulsars and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have an `` interpulse '' , a second pulse component separated from the main pulse by close to @xmath6 of pulse phase , or widely separated pulse components . in most cases ,",
    "such pulsars do not exhibit radius - to - frequency mapping , that is , they have frequency - independent pulse component separations @xcite .",
    "the known population of @xmath0-ray pulsars has recently been greatly expanded by the six - month data release of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter a10 ) .",
    "this sample of 46 @xmath0-ray pulsars includes both young pulsars and msps , all with high spin - down luminosities : @xmath7 where @xmath8gm@xmath9 is the assumed neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath10 is the rotation period in seconds and @xmath11 is the period time - derivative .",
    "recent studies indicate that @xmath0-ray emission from pulsars originates at high altitudes in the pulsar magnetosphere , near @xmath5 and from the last open field lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two classes of high - altitude particle acceleration and emission model are generally considered : slot - gap accelerators @xcite from the polar cap",
    "outwards along the last open field lines , and outer - gap accelerators @xcite where the last closed field lines cross the null - charge surface defined by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the rotation velocity vector , and @xmath14 is the magnetic field vector ) .",
    "these models result in what we shall term _ wide - beam _ emission geometries .",
    "low - altitude models for @xmath0-ray emission have been largely ruled out by the generally wide and multi - component @xmath0-ray pulse profiles and the existence of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission at energies greater than a few gev ; at low altitudes such emission is precluded by electron - positron pair absorption .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that outer - gap models are statistically preferred over slot - gap models based on fits to lat pulse profiles for a sample of bright @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "four of the five brightest @xmath0-ray pulsars detected by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) are also radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "this , together with the similar radio and @xmath0-ray pulse morphology for many young pulsars and msps , led @xcite to suggest that , for these high-@xmath3 pulsars , the radio emission is also emitted in wide beams from the outer magnetosphere near @xmath5 . within the framework of polar cap emission , @xcite and ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter kj07 ) proposed that the radio emission from young pulsars is emitted at intermediate altitudes of @xmath15 km or @xmath16 in order to account for wide profiles of young pulsars .    in this letter , we identify samples of @xmath0-ray - selected and radio - selected pulsars and consider the pulsars in each sample that also emit radio and @xmath0-ray pulses respectively .",
    "we then discuss the implications of our analysis for the radio beams of young pulsars and msps .",
    "we examine two pulsar samples : a @xmath0-ray - selected sample ( sample g ) and a radio - selected sample ( sample r ) .",
    "each sample consists of a set of pulsars detectable using `` blind search '' techniques in the relevant band .",
    "a10 presented a catalogue of @xmath0-ray pulsars detected using two different techniques .",
    "first , 29 @xmath0-ray pulsars were found using timing ephemerides , mostly from contemporaneous radio observations of 218 pulsars with @xmath17ergs@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "twenty of these were young pulsars , and nine were msps .",
    "the second method involved a blind search for @xmath0-ray pulsars at the positions of @xmath18300 unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in the six - month lat all - sky image .",
    "this search was sensitive to periodicities between 0.15s and 2s , and yielded 16 @xmath0-ray pulsar discoveries . a further two pulsars with existing @xmath0-ray rotation ephemerides  geminga and psr j1124@xmath195916 ",
    "were also re - detected .",
    "while geminga is well known for its lack of radio pulses @xcite , psr j1124@xmath195916 is a radio pulsar for which a @xmath0-ray rotation ephemeris was used because the extremely weak radio emission makes radio timing difficult @xcite .",
    "sample g consists of all @xmath0-ray pulsars found in the lat blind search .",
    "we further include those pulsars found using radio ephemerides that have phase - averaged @xmath0-ray fluxes above the blind search sensitivity limit .- ray background in figure 10 of a10 .",
    "] this is a conservative estimate , as some of the lat blind search pulsars are in fact below the limit .",
    "our inclusion in sample g of pulsars where the @xmath0-ray pulses were first detected using radio - based ephemerides is justified because the blind search over the unidentified @xmath0-ray point sources was carried out after the search using radio ephemerides . in total",
    ", we included the 18 pulsars found in the @xmath0-ray blind search and 17 pulsars found using radio ephemerides , of which three are msps .",
    "searches for radio pulses from 15 of the blind search pulsars by @xcite have revealed two detections .",
    "we do not discard the three blind search pulsars that have not been searched for radio emission by @xcite because their positions have already been searched by the greenbank low - luminosity pulsar survey @xcite with a limiting flux density of 2  mjy at 400  mhz .",
    "therefore , of the 35 @xmath0-ray pulsars in sample g , 20 are radio pulsars .",
    "sample r was formed from the 218 high-@xmath4 radio pulsars observed by the lat , of which 25 are also @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "@xmath3 values were corrected for the shklovskii effect @xcite using values of @xmath11 , proper motion and ne2001 distances @xcite given in the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite ; only pulsars with corrected @xmath17ergs@xmath2 were included in sample r. we note that the sample g pulsars have already had the shklovskii corrections applied ( a10 ) .",
    "psr b1509@xmath1958 was not detected in the lat data , but was found by the agile @xmath0-ray telescope @xcite and so we include it in sample r. another pulsar , psr j0034@xmath190534 , was detected using 13 months of _ fermi _ lat data @xcite .",
    "fourteen of the high-@xmath3 pulsars were not detected in blind radio surveys , but were found in deep searches of supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and egret error boxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we discard these 14 pulsars from sample r. this leaves 200 radio - selected pulsars in sample r , of which 17 are @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "table  [ tb : samples ] summarizes the two samples .",
    "we consider the radio and @xmath0-ray beams as being defined by emissivity functions @xmath20 , where the index @xmath21 indicates , respectively , the radio and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "the co - latitude angle @xmath22 is measured from the rotation axis and @xmath23 is the longitudinal angle .",
    "the `` latitude coverage '' , @xmath24 , of a beam is defined as the longitude integration of @xmath25 : @xmath26 the fraction of the celestial sphere swept out by each beam  the `` beaming fraction ''  is given by @xmath27 where the normalisation is such that @xmath28 .    to assist with visualisation , we approximate the beams by `` top - hat '' functions where @xmath29 is constant ( and non - zero ) over some beamwidth @xmath30 and zero elsewhere as illustrated in figure  [ fg : beams ] .",
    "@xmath30 is effectively the equivalent width of the beam in latitude .",
    "we note that the beaming fraction @xmath31 defined by equation  [ eq : beamfr ] corresponds to the @xmath32 term defined in @xcite for such a top - hat beam .",
    "there are four possible configurations for a pulsar emitting in both the radio and @xmath0-ray bands : 1 .",
    "the radio and @xmath0-ray beams have no overlap .",
    "partial overlap of the beams .",
    "3 . the radio beam is narrower than the @xmath0-ray beam and entirely overlapping .",
    "4 . the @xmath0-ray beam is narrower than the radio beam and entirely overlapping .    if we assume that pulsar rotation axes are randomly oriented in space and that pulses are detectable for observer lines of sight within the beams , then the number of pulsars detectable in band @xmath33 is proportional to the beaming fraction @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , provided the beam co - latitude @xmath34 is not too small , then the number of pulsars detectable in band @xmath33 is approximately proportional to the beamwidth @xmath30 .",
    "importantly , the number detected in both bands is proportional to the width of the overlap region @xmath35 .",
    "the issue of pulsar detectability is of course critical .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath0-ray luminosity of a pulsar , @xmath36 , is strongly dependent on its spin - down luminosity @xmath3 . while some @xmath0-ray emission models predict @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume an empirical relation @xmath38 after @xcite . this implies the commonly used @xmath0-ray detectability metric of the pulsar spin - down flux at the telescope , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the pulsar distance .",
    "in contrast , the radio luminosity of pulsars is essentially uncorrelated with both @xmath4 and @xmath39 .",
    "given that nearly 2000 radio pulsars are known compared to just 46 @xmath0-ray pulsars , it is reasonable to assume that selection effects are much more significant in the @xmath0-ray band and that all @xmath0-ray pulsars are emitting potentially detectable radio beams .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath0-ray - selected sample g , the radio fraction , i.e. , the ratio of the number of radio detections to the total , @xmath41 , is an estimate of the ratio @xmath42 . for configuration 3 in figure  [ fg : beams ] , @xmath43 ; in all other configurations @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 since the values of @xmath46 follow a binomial distribution , the standard error on this mean value is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of pulsars in the sample .",
    "we conclude that , on average for @xmath0-ray emitting pulsars , the radio beaming fraction is at least half the @xmath0-ray beaming fraction .",
    "it is possible that some of the current sample g pulsars will be detected in the radio band , which would increase @xmath49 . with the continued operation of the lat",
    ", it is certain that the sample of @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars will increase . the value of @xmath50 may either increase or decrease , but its uncertainty will decrease .",
    "the longitudinal geometries of the beams are not constrained ; therefore the radio and @xmath0-ray emission regions need not be co - located .    to quantify the true latitude coverage of the radio beams with respect to the @xmath0-ray beams ,",
    "as opposed to just constraining the overlapping area , we compare the radio - selected sample r with sample g. first , given that the lat is only sensitive to pulsars with high values of @xmath39 , the @xmath0-ray fraction in sample r , @xmath51 , is not significant to this discussion .",
    "instead , we order the pulsars in the two samples by decreasing @xmath3 and consider the ratios @xmath49 and @xmath52 as functions of @xmath3 . for each pulsar , we compute the ratios for the sub - sample of pulsars with @xmath3 greater than or equal to the value for that pulsar .    the results are shown graphically in figure  [ fg : samp ] .",
    "it is striking that the seven highest-@xmath3 sample g pulsars are detected in both bands . within the same @xmath3 range ,",
    "all four sample r pulsars are also @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "it is therefore evident that @xmath49 and @xmath52 have comparable values in this high-@xmath3 regime . for lower-@xmath3 values and correspondingly lower-@xmath39 values in sample r ( shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fg : samp ] ) @xmath53 reduces sharply , but this is entirely due the @xmath39 selection for @xmath0-ray pulsar detections .",
    "however , it is significant that some radio - only pulsars with @xmath3 between @xmath54 and @xmath55  ergs@xmath2 have high values of @xmath39 .",
    "these pulsars probably have @xmath0-ray beams not directed toward us , suggesting that the radio beams for these high-@xmath3 pulsars are of comparable width to the @xmath0-ray beams and do not always overlap with their latitude coverage .",
    "any of configurations 1 , 2 , or 4 in figure  [ fg : beams ] could be applicable to this case .",
    "in contrast , under the assumption that radio pulse detectability is independent of @xmath3 , sample g is free of these selection effects and the drop in @xmath49 at @xmath56ergs@xmath2 can be interpreted as an evolution in @xmath49 from unity for high-@xmath3 @xmath0-ray pulsars to @xmath57 for lower-@xmath3 @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "in general , the highest-@xmath3 pulsars are among the youngest known pulsars , as determined , for example , by snr associations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pulsars evolve toward lower @xmath3 values .",
    "it therefore appears that , for the highest-@xmath3 pulsars , the radio and @xmath0-ray beams have comparable beaming fractions with largely overlapping radio and @xmath0-ray beams . as these pulsars age , the radio beams evolve to overlap about half the latitude coverage of the @xmath0-ray beams .",
    "ultimately the pulsars become undetectable in the @xmath0-ray band and the radio beams become even narrower as they evolve toward the beaming fractions of @xmath58 typical for older pulsars @xcite .",
    "the lower-@xmath3 pulsars in samples g and r include five msps ,- ray detections of eight msps , three did not fall within either of the cutoffs applied to samples g or r. ] marked with the letter ` m ' in figure  [ fg : samp ] . despite the differences between normal pulsars and msps ( e.g. , surface magnetic field strength and rotation period ) we do not isolate msps from our samples for three reasons .",
    "first , the three msps in sample g were @xmath0-ray - selected , which implies some commonalities with young @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "second , the nine msps detected with the lat by @xcite and @xcite have values of @xmath39 that are among those of the top 18 msps searched , which gives a @xmath0-ray fraction of 0.5 , consistent with the lower bound on the radio fraction for the lower-@xmath3 sample g pulsars ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "third , it has been suggested by @xcite , based on pulse profile and giant pulse characteristics , that millisecond pulsars have wide radio beams similar to those of young pulsars .",
    "therefore , in the discussion below on the radio beams of @xmath0-ray emitting pulsars , we treat young pulsars and msps together .",
    "to test the consistency of our results with various empirical polar - cap models for pulsar beaming , we carried out a series of monte carlo simulations for the sample g pulsars to calculate their values of @xmath49 .",
    "sample r was not considered because of the @xmath39 selection effects discussed above .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-ray beams sweep the entire celestial sphere ,",
    "that is , we assume @xmath60 , consistent with outer - magnetosphere models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each pulsar , @xmath61 pairs of @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "were randomly chosen from sinusoidal distributions peaked at @xmath64 ( @xmath62 is the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes and @xmath63 is the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight ) .",
    "the radio beam opening half - angle @xmath65 , measured from the magnetic axis , was calculated for each sample g pulsar and beaming model .",
    "the beaming fraction @xmath66 was then derived by finding the fraction of points with @xmath67 . since both @xmath62 and @xmath63 ranged between 0 and @xmath64 , emission from both magnetic poles",
    "was accounted for .",
    "we first consider the model of @xcite with @xmath68 for which we obtain an average beaming fraction of @xmath69 for the sample g pulsars , somewhat lower than our estimate of @xmath70 .",
    "we note that our assumption of @xmath60 is conservative in this context ; other similar simulations by @xcite and @xcite using theoretical predictions of @xmath71 based on the outer - gap model find @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , much less than the observed value .",
    "we then considered the model of kj07 which , for young pulsars , has a radio emission height above the polar caps of @xmath74  km , along with beaming along the last open field lines .",
    "this model results in @xmath75 , larger than our lower bound of @xmath76 .",
    "hence , the kj07 radio beaming model is consistent with our results .",
    "however , the fact that the seven highest-@xmath3 pulsars in sample g are all observed to emit radio pulses ( i.e. , have @xmath77 ) is not predicted by the kj07 model .",
    "the product of the radio beaming fractions derived from the kj07 model of these seven pulsars is 0.22 ; hence , the kj07 model has a 22% chance of reproducing this result .",
    "in contrast to the kj07 model , outer - magnetosphere wide - beam models for the radio emission predict @xmath78 , consistent with our result that @xmath49 is near unity for the highest-@xmath3 pulsars . besides this , there are other compelling reasons to consider wide - beam models for these high-@xmath3 pulsars ( cf .",
    "first , there is an excess of pulsars with widely separated pulse components or interpulses among young , high-@xmath3 pulsars ( e.g. , see fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "many of these pulsars have pulse profiles very similar to observed @xmath0-ray profiles , with bridge emission between the main components .",
    "furthermore , they have frequency - independent component separations , inconsistent with low - altitude polar - cap models . as was first pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "polarization results from many young pulsars indicate beams elongated in the latitude direction , with impact parameters , @xmath79 , that are much greater than observed pulse widths .",
    "this is inconsistent with polar - cap models but fully consistent with outer - magnetosphere models .",
    "we therefore propose that the radio emission region for young high-@xmath3 pulsars is located high in the pulsar magnetosphere , relatively close to the null - charge surface and to the @xmath0-ray - emitting region .",
    "the evolution in @xmath49 with @xmath3 suggests a slot - gap model for the radio emission and hence that radio profile components represent caustics just as for the @xmath0-ray profiles .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with a transition to low - altitude polar - cap emission for older pulsars .",
    "not all @xmath0-ray pulsars are seen in the radio and not all high-@xmath39 radio pulsars are seen in @xmath0-rays .",
    "this implies that , while the radio and @xmath0-ray emission regions may be in the same general region of the pulsar magnetosphere , they are not necessarily co - located . in the case of psr j0034@xmath190534 however , the radio and @xmath0-ray profiles are almost identical and aligned in phase , suggesting that the emission regions are in fact co - located @xcite .",
    "by comparing the relative occurrence of radio and @xmath0-ray pulsed emission in @xmath0-ray - selected and radio - selected samples , we find that the radio beaming fraction @xmath66 appears to be close to unity for the highest-@xmath3 pulsars , decreasing to @xmath80 for lower-@xmath3 @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "our estimated lower bound @xmath66 , averaged over all @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars , of @xmath76 is inconsistent with low - altitude polar - cap models for the radio emission but is consistent with kj07 s intermediate - altitude polar - cap model .",
    "however , the kj07 model is marginally inconsistent with our result that @xmath77 for the highest-@xmath3 pulsars . with other evidence from radio and @xmath0-ray pulse morphologies",
    ", these results suggest that , for high-@xmath3 pulsars , the radio emission originates in wide beams from the vicinity of the null - charge surface , possibly with a slot - gap configuration , with profile components representing caustics in the emission pattern .",
    "improved statistics from further @xmath0-ray and radio discoveries will help to test our conclusions .",
    "modelling of radio pulse profiles with slot - gap or other wide - beam emission geometries for both young high-@xmath3 pulsars and msps would be valuable .",
    "if outer - magnetoshpere wide - beam radio emission from these pulsars is confirmed , it would have profound implications for pulsar population and evolution studies as well as our understanding of radio and @xmath0-ray pulse emission mechanisms .",
