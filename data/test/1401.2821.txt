    "in classical phenomenology , turbulence arises after a sequence of symmetry breakings , successive instabilities or bifurcations , which however progressively restore the system symmetries in a statistical sense .",
    "@xcite the study of these instabilities traditionally proceeds from ( linear or non - linear ) perturbations of the so - called  basic state \" , the stationary laminar solution of the navier - stokes equation at low reynolds number . at finite reynolds number",
    "there is no general well - defined criterion to discriminate between the turbulent or laminar nature of the flow : one can not define clearly a critical threshold beyond which the flow is turbulent and below which it is laminar .",
    "the consensus view is that the flow is turbulent when the reynolds number is large enough and when a well established spatio - temporal energy spectrum is observed with broad - band power laws .",
    "in such a case a possible statistical equivalent of the laminar `` basic state '' can be defined using the ( statistically or time ) averaged flow .",
    "this flow is stationary by construction , but differs from an usual basic state in the sense that it is solution of the ensemble averaged navier - stokes equation instead of a solution of the plain navier - stokes equation .",
    "a natural question then arises : what happens once the statistically stationary turbulent state is reached ?",
    "is this the end of the story or can new instabilities of the averaged turbulent flow develop ?",
    "experimentally , the answer seems to be positive , since spontaneous bifurcations and flow reversals in fully developed turbulence have already been observed : i ) in a wake flow , there is a mean pattern transition at a critical reynolds number .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called `` drag - crisis '' ( see ref .  ) .",
    "this leads to a dramatic decrease of the mean drag of a sphere or a cylinder in a turbulent flow for a critical value of the reynolds number @xmath7 . the wake becomes narrower as the mean flow pattern changes .",
    "ii ) spontaneous flow reversals have been observed in thermally driven ( rayleigh - bnard ) convection , both experimentally@xcite and numerically.@xcite in a cylindrical rayleigh - bnard geometry the reversals of large scale circulation was reported to be induced by reorientation along the azimuthal direction.@xcite however it is difficult to experimentally characterize a bifurcation from a non - stationary or periodic flow .",
    "iii ) in a magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , the large scale magnetic field spontaneously generated in a liquid metal at @xmath8 was shown@xcite to undergo spontaneous reversals , with a dynamics governed by a few magnetic modes despite the strongly turbulent background .",
    "this observation led to a simple model of geodynamos , with a few modes undergoing chaotic dynamics.@xcite an open problem common to all these situations is to find suitable tools to study and characterize these type of instabilities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present some answers to these questions in the specific case of a von krmn flow .",
    "this flow is generated by two counter - rotating impellers in a cylindrical vessel . at low reynolds number ,",
    "the laminar flow is axi - symmetric and divided into two toric recirculation cells separated by an azimuthal shear layer .",
    "its transition to turbulence for various counter - rotations and aspect ratio has been extensively studied theoretically , numerically and experimentally , with smooth or rough ( fitted with blades ) impellers ( see e.g. refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the study in ref .   was performed in the exact - counter - rotating case .",
    "it was reported that a first bifurcation from the stationary and axi - symmetric laminar state occurs at @xmath9 , yielding a stationary flow with an azimuthal modulation , _",
    "i.e. _ for which the axisymmetry is broken .",
    "this stationary state persists up to typically @xmath10 where time - dependence arises .",
    "the transition to turbulence further proceeds through plain , modulated or chaotic traveling waves , until @xmath11 , where a  fully developed turbulent state \" seems to have been reached .",
    "in that state , the energy spectrum is broad and the dimensionless dissipation does not depend on reynolds number anymore .",
    "@xcite in that turbulent state , the flow once time averaged regains the structure of the basic laminar flow , made of two shearing toric recirculation cells . in the present paper , we have worked using the same experimental setup .",
    "we demonstrate that the flow is organized into large scale coherent structures .",
    "these structures are subject to a sequence of eckhaus type instabilities leading to an increasing azimuthal wavenumber as the reynolds number varies from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , similar to the sequence of instabilities at much lower @xmath0 . since this sequence of instabilities occurs on coherent structures in a turbulent flow rather than a laminar  basic state \" , we are facing a new paradigm that both requires new tools of investigations and opens interesting questions about turbulence parametrization .",
    "the tools are presented in section  [ sec : technical ] , the instability is described in section  [ sec : results ] and some theoretical consequences are discussed in section  [ sec : theocons ] .",

    "we consider another aspect of the same problem related to the stability of the unsteady coherent structures of a turbulent flow ( in other words , to the dynamic of the perturbation of this given coherent structures ) .",
    "we have shown that using spatio - temporal spectra , and comparison or projection onto suitable beltrami modes , it is possible to identify coherent perturbations to the time - averaged flow .",
    "this is liable to an eckhaus instability analog to what is observed in systems in the laminar limit , with a few degrees of freedom . in classical phenomenology of turbulence",
    "the number of degrees of freedom scales like @xmath87 . given our range of reynolds number ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , we thus can expect our system to be described by a number of degrees of freedom in the range @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "our results thus prove that a huge number of degrees of freedom are irrelevant to describe the instability of our turbulent flow .",
    "this sets a number of interesting questions , that we list below .    in the present paper , we have characterized experimentally the instability of the basic state .",
    "is there any analytical or numerical way to explain our observations ?",
    "classical instability analysis for a given velocity field @xmath90 starts from stationary solutions of the navier - stokes equation : @xmath91 in our case , we consider the instability of a time - average basic state @xmath92 , that obeys the equation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the reynolds stress tensor .",
    "this reynolds stress represents the influence of all the degrees of freedom of the flow onto its average , and can , in general , only be computed via full solution of the ns equation .",
    "therefore , the problem of instability of a mean turbulent flow can not be tackled analytically or is too demanding numerically , unless a prescription ( parametrization ) of the reynolds stress is provided . in the case of the plane",
    "couette turbulent flow , for example , this was attempted by tuckerman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite via the k - @xmath95 closure model .",
    "they calculate steady 1d solution profiles of the k - @xmath95 model and their linear stability to 3d perturbations , but find no correspondence between this analysis and the onset of turbulent - laminar bands in experiments and simulations . in the same way , legras and villone@xcite address the problem of kolmogorov flow instability when molecular viscosity is replaced by a smagorinsky parametrization for small - scale turbulence .",
    "such a parametrization represents the motion at scales smaller than the large scale kolmogorov flow .",
    "they claim that it may provide hints on large - scale instabilities at large @xmath0 and , hopefully , on the character of such instabilities , but it has never been checked . in our case , it was observed that the sequence of eckhaus instability resembles the sequence of instability observed at much lower reynolds number .",
    "@xcite this suggest that the replacement of the reynolds stress by an eddy - viscosity might be a suitable parametrization by increasing the dissipation , and therefore decreasing the effective reynolds number ( and the effective number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "theoretically , we note that the special geometry of our experiment and its parity symmetry properties make it plausible that the first term in the expansion of the reynolds stress as a function of the velocity gradient is indeed quadratic , resulting in a non - isotropic eddy - viscosity tensor ( in other words , there is probably no anisotropic kinetic alpha ( aka ) term in the reynolds stress expansion ) .",
    "@xcite it is however not clear that the correct parameters of the instability ( threshold , wavenumbers ) can be captured with a simple eddy - viscosity model , since this procedure fails in the case of a plane couette flow .",
    "@xcite an interesting alternative would be to derive directly the mean state as the critical points of a suitable arnold functional , making the problem liable to traditional tolls of bifurcation theory .",
    "such strategy was followed in ref .  , resulting in a full description of a spontaneous parity - breaking turbulent bifurcation .",
    "the generalization of this model to non - axisymmetric mean state is however an open problem .    summarizing",
    ", we have shown that the fluctuations of a turbulent von krmn flow obey a sequence of eckhaus - like instabilities with varying reynolds number that is similar to the sequence of echaus instability observed in the laminar flow , at much lower reynolds number and that may be explained through a suitable parametrization by increasing the dissipation , and therefore decreasing the effective reynolds number ( and the effective number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "if this is indeed true , it may have interesting implications for other fields , especially astrophysics and geophysics where reynolds number are huge and our interest is mainly in the dynamics of the large - scale mean flow .",
    "for example , current climate models that have presently very low effective reynolds number may be able to capture efficiently certain types of instabilities of the mean ( climatic ) turbulent state",
