    "we performed an optical spectroscopic observation of swift j0601.98636  ( eso 005g004 ) during the night of 2007 march 16 , using the saao 1.9-m telescope with the cassegrain spectrograph .",
    "grating six , with a spectral range of about 3500 - 5300   at a resolution around 4  , was used with a 2 arcsec slit placed on the center of the galaxy for a total integration time of 2400 s. to derive the sensitivity curve , we fit the observed spectral energy distribution of standard stars with low - order polynomial . the co - added , flux - calibrated spectrum in the 4000 - 5500   range is shown in figure  2 .",
    "it reveals a rather featureless spectrum with no evidence for h@xmath68 or [ o  iii ] @xmath695007 emission lines , typical for this type of non - active edge - on galaxy within this spectral range .",
    "the 90% upper limit on the [ o  iii ] flux is conservatively estimated to be @xmath70 erg @xmath6 s@xmath13 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath71 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "this yields the ratio of the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity to the _ observed _ [ o  iii ] luminosity of @xmath72 .",
    "although the ( unknown ) extinction correction for [ o  iii ] could reduce the value , the result is consistent with swift j0601.98636  having an intrinsically weak [ o  iii ] emission relative to hard x - rays compared with other seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , this object would not have been selected to be an agn on the basis of its [ o  iii ] or h@xmath68 emission .",
    "both sources show an intense reflection component relative to the transmitted one . using the standard reflection model @xcite",
    ", we find that the solid angle of the reflector @xmath73 viewed from the nucleus exceeds unity , which is apparently unphysical if attributed only to geometry .",
    "this implies that a part of the direct emission is completely blocked by non - uniform material in the line of sight even above 10 kev .",
    "the reflection - dominated nature of the spectra of heavily obscured agns , if common , has an impact on the population synthesis model of the xrb , where a much weaker reflection is assumed for type 2 agns @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that this apparent very high reflection fraction is due to time variability , that is , the decrease of the flux in the transmitted light is echoed with a time delay corresponding to the difference in light paths between the emitter , reflector , and observers .",
    "it is remarkable that both swift j0601.98636  and swift j0138.64001  have a very small amount of soft x - ray scattered emission , less than 0.46% of the intrinsic power law component .",
    "( if we fix @xmath74 in the spectral fit of swift j0601.98636 , then we obtain a photon index of @xmath75 and no significant scattered component with a 90% upper limit of 0.47% . ) as far as we know these are amongst the lowest scattered fractions ever seen from an absorbed agn @xcite .",
    "in optically selected seyfert 2 galaxies , the presence of prominent soft x - ray emission is common ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such emission probably originates from the same extended gas responsible for the optical [ o  iii ] emission @xcite .",
    "this type of emission from `` classical '' seyfert 2 galaxies has always been seen in the spectra of objects well studied so far .",
    "however , this sample is dominated by optically selected seyfert 2 galaxies , which require a scattered component to be selected .",
    "the scattered fraction is proportional to both the solid angle of the scattering region as viewed from the nucleus , @xmath76 , and the scattering optical depth , @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the observed small scattered fraction means small @xmath76 and/or small @xmath77 i.e. , deficiency of gas in the circumnuclear environment , for some unknown reason .",
    "the first possibility , which we favor as a more plausible case , indicates that these agns are buried in a very geometrically - thick obscuring torus . assuming that the typical scattering fraction of 3% corresponds to the effective torus half - opening angle ( see @xcite for definition ) @xmath78 of 45 degree , our results ( @xmath79 ) indicate @xmath80 degree . in the case of swift j0601.98636 , the small absorption for the reflection component , which probably comes from the inner wall of the torus",
    ", suggests that we are seeing this source in a rather face - on geometry .",
    "indeed , applying the formalism of @xcite to the observed ew of the iron - k line , we infer that the inclination angle with respect to the axis of the disk , @xmath81 , is smaller than 40 degrees if @xmath82 degree . for swift j0138.64001",
    ", the presence of a high column density for the reflection component implies a more edge - on geometry than in swift j0601.98636 .",
    "the observed ew of @xmath55 kev can be explained if the torus is patchy or has a geometrical structure such that the line - of - sight column density is much smaller than that in the disk plane .",
    "we infer that this type of buried agns is a significant fraction of the whole agn population , although an accurate estimate of this fraction is difficult at present due to the small number statistics kev ) selected agns . ] .",
    "the observed fraction of heavily obscured agns with log @xmath1  @xmath83 is about 25% among the hard x - ray ( @xmath8415 kev ) selected agns @xcite . the true number density of obscured agns could be much larger , however .",
    "if we saw the same system of our targets at much larger inclination angles ( @xmath85 degree ) , the observed flux of the transmitted component would be much fainter even in hard x - rays due to the effects of repeated compton scatterings @xcite .",
    "our results imply that there must be a large number of yet unrecognized , compton thick agns in the local universe , which are likely to be missed even in the _ swift _  and _ integral _  surveys .",
    "the existence of agns with a geometrically thick torus was predicted by @xcite , where the extreme obscuration was postulated to be caused by a nuclear starburst . using the @xmath86 m and @xmath87 m fluxes measured by _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ , we obtain the far infrared luminosity ( defined by @xcite ) of @xmath88 erg s@xmath13  and @xmath89 erg s@xmath13 , and hence the ratio between the 210 kev to far infrared luminosities of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for swift j0601.98636  and swift j0138.64001 , respectively . while the result of swift j0138.64001  is consistent with those of the 210 kev selected agns in the local universe @xcite within the scatter , the small @xmath92 ratio of swift j0601.98636indicates a possibly significant starburst activity .",
    "however , this is not supported by the optical spectrum of this object , which apparently shows no evidence for a significant amount of star formation .",
    "the reason behind the difference between the two sources is unclear .    by using the unique combination of the _ swift _  bat survey and the _ suzaku _  broad band spectral capabilities",
    ", we are discovering a new type of agn with an extremely small scattering fraction .",
    "this class of object is most likely to contain a buried agn in a very geometrically - thick torus .",
    "this population was missed in previous surveys , demonstrating the power of hard x - ray ( @xmath010 kev ) surveys to advance our global understanding of the whole agn population . in particular",
    ", we predict that the objects should have fainter [ o  iii ] emission luminosity relative to the hard x - ray luminosity compared with classical seyfert 2 galaxies because much less of the nuclear flux `` leaks '' out to ionize the narrow line gas .",
    "as shown above , the optical spectrum of swift j0601.98636  is consistent with this prediction .",
    "this study is particularly important since the existence of numerous such objects would make surveys that rely on the [ o  iii ] emission incomplete by missing many of buried agns and incorrectly estimating the true agn luminosity .",
