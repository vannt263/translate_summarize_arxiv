    "strong sensitivity to initial conditions is a signature of chaotic behavior in dynamical systems @xcite . in closed quantum systems , however , such a behavior is excluded by the linearity of the unitarity of the time evolution . nevertheless , despite this characteristic linearity of closed quantum systems , chaotic features can arise in open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , non - linear quantum state transformations can arise when identically prepared quantum systems are subjected to an entangling unitary transformation and a subsequent selective measurement performed on parts of the system @xcite .",
    "iterating such non - linear quantum state transformations may result in strong dependence on the initial conditions and in complex chaos @xcite .",
    "quantum state purification protocols involving identically prepared weakly entangled two - qubit systems , as introduced by bennett and deutsch @xcite , are typical examples involving repeated sequences of unitary entangling transformations and selective conditional quantum measurements @xcite . in these protocols",
    "the parameters are designed in such a way that quantum state purification can be achieved and a complicated dependence on initial conditions is avoided @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that in general an intricate dependence of the resulting entanglement on the initially prepared states will occur @xcite .",
    "sensitivity to initial conditions can also be used for amplifying small initial differences of quantum states ( schrdinger microscrope @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that such an amplification requires necessarily a large number of identically prepared systems which have to be discarded during the process @xcite .",
    "recent advances of quantum technology have enabled the control of complicated many - body quantum systems to an unprecedented degree of accuracy so that even subtle effects of quantum measurement - induced nonlinearities may become amenable to experimental observation @xcite . in particular , the area of cavity quantum electrodynamics offers interesting perspectives for future experiments in these directions in view of its possibilities to measure and control the interaction of individual atoms with a single mode of the quantized radiation field with high precision @xcite .    in this paper we explore the intricate nonlinear properties of measurement - induced chaos in a cavity quantum electrodynamical scenario . this scenario is a generalization of the dynamics of a one - atom - micro - maser @xcite which may be viewed as an early example of an iterative unitary quantum dynamics conditioned on state selective quantum measurements .",
    "motivated by recent experimental advances which realize the tavis - cummings model @xcite we consider an ensemble of identically prepared two - level atoms ( qubits ) which interact pairwise with a single mode of the radiation field .",
    "afterwards , one member of each pair and the corresponding cavity field are measured .",
    "conditioned on the measurement results , the unmeasured atoms are kept or discarded . in practice , this may be implemented with the help of a single cavity and a pair of optical conveyor belts @xcite .",
    "the atoms are moved through the cavity by the conveyor belts in such a way that only one pair of atoms interacts with the cavity mode at a time and then the cavity is re - initialized after each interaction .",
    "the remaining atoms form a new identically prepared ensemble of smaller size .",
    "similar as in entanglement distillation protocols , the state changes of the remaining two - level atoms are described by an iterated nonlinear quantum transformation .",
    "it is demonstrated that this nonlinear quantum transformation exhibits measurement - induced chaos and the resulting julia sets can be connected or disconnected .",

    "our aim is to prepare the atoms in an atomic postselection scenario where the atoms are prepared conditioned to a successful projection of the field onto the initial coherent state @xmath58 in a simplified and ideal implementation . in such a case , one would have to consider the following overlaps @xmath59 this result can be obtained by noting that the overlap between coherent states is given by @xmath60}\\right|    \\approx&e^{- g^2t^2 } ,    \\nonumber    \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be neglected if @xmath61 . therefore , after interaction with the resonator and projection onto state @xmath58 , both atoms are left in the state @xmath62 with @xmath63 success probability .",

    "<S> we propose a cavity qed scheme based on the tavis - cummings model to realize a conditional , non - linear dynamics exhibiting complex chaos in an ensemble of two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms interact pairwise with the coherent cavity field , which is subjected to homodyne measurement after the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> one member of the pair of atoms is then measured and upon condition that it is found in its ground state the other member of the pair is kept , otherwise discarded . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum state of the resulting ensemble of atoms is related to the state of the original ensemble via a non - linear transformation . by iterating this process with the help of an optical conveyor belt , for example , </S>",
    "<S> one arrives at complex deterministic chaos , where the evolution of pure quantum states is sensitive to the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover basic features of this dynamics by exploring stability regions in the space of initial states and analyze the occurrence of stable periodic orbits in dependence of the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that sensitivity to initial conditions can be applied to amplify small differences of quantum states . </S>"
