    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) ( also known as large - scale mimo ) is considered as one of the most promising technologies for next generation wireless communication systems @xcite , since it can provide very high spectral and energy efficiencies . besides , for massive mimo systems , the effects of small - scale fading and interference can be significantly reduced with linear signal processing , such as maximal - ratio transmission ( mrt ) and zero - forcing ( zf ) @xcite .",
    "the performance of massive mimo single / multi - cell downlink systems has been widely studied in the literature . in @xcite , the asymptotic signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) for linear precoding in single - cell _ frequency - division - duplex _ ( fdd ) systems was derived based on which the optimization of the user number was investigated . in @xcite , the power scaling ,",
    "i.e. , how fast the transmission power can decrease with the antenna number while maintaining a certain sinr level , for multi - cell _ time - division - duplex _",
    "( tdd ) systems was given based on asymptotic sinr analysis , where the pilot contamination was shown to be the only performance limit . in @xcite , capacity lower bounds and energy efficiency of mrt and zf in single - cell tdd systems were studied and compared with each other . in the parallel field of uplink systems , similar results were derived in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these works mainly focus on the derivations of asymptotically deterministic expression for the sinr , and the performance analysis only consider some special cases , e.g. , the constant or linearly increasing user number with respect to the base station ( bs ) antenna number , the power scaling for perfect or imperfect channel state information ( csi ) with equal training and transmission power and constant user number .    recently , along this route , the performance improvement for using coherent detection based on the dedicated downlink channel estimation was shown in @xcite , especially for large but finite antenna numbers .",
    "meanwhile , the impact of other practical factors such as channel aging @xcite , hardware limits @xcite , and rician fading @xcite on the performance of massive mimo systems was studied . however , a comprehensive scaling law analysis for multi - cell multi - user massive mimo is still missing in existing works .",
    "another important problem in the performance analysis of massive mimo is when the derived asymptotic results are applicable in practical systems .",
    "while many works derived deterministic sinr approximations via calculating the expected value of the sinr or its compenents , the analysis on whether the instantaneous sinr becomes asymptotically deterministic and converges to the derived expressions is sometimes missing . in @xcite , this problem was studied through the so called massive mimo efficiency for the ideal situation that the noise , channel estimation error , and interference are negligible compared with pilot contamination , where the dependence of the massive mimo efficiency on the ratio of spatial degrees of freedom / antenna number to the user number and the product of antenna number and transmit power was shown by simulations . in @xcite , via simulations , the convergence speed of the strong law of large numbers with respect to the antenna number and the convergence of the sinr of mrt and zf to their expected values were both analyzed for fixed ratio of antenna number to user number .",
    "it was shown that the sinr of mrt has slower convergence than that of zf , while the explicit relationship between the convergence speed and important parameters , i.e. , antenna number , user number , transmit power , and channel training energy ( csi quality ) , is missing .    in this work , by drawing lessons from the analyzing method and the mean square convergence definition in @xcite , we provide a comprehensive performance scaling law analysis for multi - cell multi - user tdd massive mimo downlink systems with channel spatial correlation , csi error , and pilot contamination and investigate the applicability of the derived asymptotic scaling law in practical systems with large but finite antenna numbers .",

    "* we consider a multi - cell multi - user massive mimo network with correlated channel model , csi error , and pilot contamination . in dealing with pilot contamination ,",

    "an approximate model for the pce effect is proposed .",

    "the result reveals the effect and joint interaction of extensive network parameters , i.e , the channel training energy , the transmission power , and the user number . in the scaling - law analysis ,",
    "a general model is used where the parameters have continuous scaling exponents with respect to the number of bs antennas , while in most existing work , only a few discrete values for the power scaling exponent , e.g. , @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ; @xmath2 , are allowed . * to understand the applicability of the derived scaling law in practical systems with large but finite antenna number",
    ", the effect of antenna number on its accuracy is analyzed and evaluated by simulations .",
    "* we conduct quantitative analysis on the asymptotically deterministic property of random instantaneous sinr using the mean square convergence .",
    "sufficient conditions for the instantaneous sinr to be asymptotically deterministic are given , from which the tradeoff among different parameter scales is discovered .    in @xcite ,",
    "the performance scaling law for multi - user massive mimo relay networks was extensively studied .",
    "while our work adopts the mean square convergence idea and the sinr analysis method from @xcite , it is fundamentally different in both network model and channel model .",
    "we consider the multi - cell multi - user massive mimo downlink networks with a general spatially correlated channel model .",
    "furthermore , as crucial issues for multi - cell systems , the pilot contamination and pce are taken into account in our work . as a result , the corresponding derivation procedures and analytical results are significantly different . in addition , the analysis on the effectiveness of the derived scaling law for practically large but finite antenna numbers is completely new .",

    "this section studies the general performance scaling law of the massive mimo network .",
    "first , the means and scvs of all sinr components are calculated .",
    "consequently , a sum - rate lower bound based on jensens inequality is derived via exploiting the asymptotically deterministic property of the desired signal power .",

    "thus for large @xmath14 , @xmath96 can be approximated with its mean .",

    "for practical ranges of the network parameters , it is assumed that @xmath123 .",
    "the reasons are given as follows .",
    "firstly , in typical applications of massive mimo , @xmath19 either increases with @xmath14 or keeps constant .",
    "thus @xmath124 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath19 can not exceed @xmath14 since the maximum multiplexing gain is @xmath14 .",

    "but it can decrease as @xmath14 increases with the condition that its decreasing rate is lower than the increasing rate of @xmath14 .",
    "this is because that the maximum achievable array gain for compensating the loss of receiving energy is @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath126 .",
    "for the same reasons , @xmath127 is considered .",
    "another important parameter for the performance analysis is @xmath103 which quantifies the pilot contamination level .",

    "specifically , the difference among users channel directions @xcite or locations @xcite and smart pilot allocation based on them @xcite were utilized to avoid pilot contamination , and corresponding simulations showed that as @xmath14 increases , lower pilot contamination level can be achieved . in our work , the effect of pce is reflected by the @xmath128 parameter in our modeling , which is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the special case of @xmath129 represents perfect pce , i.e. , highly correlated channels .",

    "the scaling law in ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) illustrates quantitatively the relationship between the performance scaling and scalings of all important parameters .",
    "the condition in ( [ eq32 ] ) , on the other hand , provides useful guidelines for the design of the massive mimo network .",
    "equation ( [ eq30 ] ) shows that with perfect pce , the scaling of the sinr @xmath122 is determined by the scaling exponent of the channel training energy @xmath119 and per - user transmission power @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq30 ] ) also shows that the scaling of the sinr is a decreasing function of both .",
    "thus higher per - user transmission power and training energy result in improved performance , and one can compensate for the other in performance .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) shows that with imperfect pce , @xmath122 is upper bounded by zero due to the pilot contamination bottleneck and it can be seen from that @xmath139 .",
    "this means that the asymptotic performance will be constant with respect to @xmath14 , while the concrete value is dependent on the efficiency of pce , which is more general than the result in @xcite .      in this subsection",
