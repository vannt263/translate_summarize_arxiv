    "wireless access networks are the typical last - mile networks connecting multiple users to a high speed backbone . in these networks , a base station ( bs ) serves a large group of users .",
    "traditionally , either the time or the frequency are divided to ensure users do not interfere with each other .",
    "modern coding techniques , however , allow for multiple users to either transmit or receive simultaneously , and be decoded successfully using the appropriate multiple access channel ( mac ) codes or broadcast channel ( bc ) codes , respectively .    nevertheless , consider a bs serving a very large number of users . in practical scenarios ,",
    "not all users can be served simultaneously , and the problem of user selection or scheduling arises . in the downlink setting , where a bs transmits to a group of users , it is common to assume channel state information ( csi ) is available at the bs , hence intelligent user selection can be employed .",
    "e.g. , the bs can select a subset of the users with both strong channel norms ( high snr ) and relatively orthogonal directions ( to avoid interference ) . see section  [ sec .",
    "related ] for a literature survey .",
    "such a selection can exploit the _ multi - user diversity _ inherent in these models .    in the uplink setting , however , since the users transmit to the bs , it is highly desirable to avoid the process of collecting all information at the bs beforehand , and notifying the users which should transmit .",
    "this process is prohibitively complex when the number of users is very large .",
    "in fact , this is one of the main reasons why an emerging standard , ieee 802.11ac , includes multi - user multiple input multiple output ( mu - mimo ) only at the downlink @xcite .",
    "that is , the allegedly complex process of selecting a subset of users in the uplink is refrained from .",
    "hence , efficient and distributed algorithms for selecting the appropriate group of users are desirable . this way , there is hope to harness the benefits of multi - user diversity without the need to collect csi from all users . in this paper",
    ", we show that this is indeed possible , by showing the order - optimality of distributed algorithms .",
    "we consider a mimo mac channel with @xmath0 receiving antennas and @xmath1 users .",
    "we suggest distributed algorithms for selecting a group of users to transmit in each slot . in the first",
    ", a threshold value for the norm of the channel vector is set , and only users above the threshold transmit .",
    "hence , there is no need to collect csi from all users . nor is any cooperation required . in the second ,",
    "an iterative process is suggested , where _ multiple thresholds _ are set on the norms of the _ projections of the channel vectors _ on the spaces of previously selected users . in this case",
    ", csi is shared , but _ only among the selected group_.    an analysis of the resulting sum capacity in the limit of large @xmath2 and the respective scaling laws are given for both zero - forcing ( zf ) and minimal mean square error ( mmse ) receivers .",
    "this analysis employs recent tools from both point process approximation and asymptotic random matrix theory , that to the best of our knowledge , were not used in this setting before . via this analysis ,",
    "the simple distributed , threshold based algorithm , is shown to achieve the optimal scaling laws .",
    "consequently , the benefit compared to traditional ( centralized ) techniques is demonstrated both analytically and via simulation results .",

    "the essence of multi - user diversity was introduced in @xcite , where selecting the strongest user in each time slot was first suggested .",
    "the work was followed by numerous scheduling algorithms for various scenarios .",
    "we list here only the most relevant .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the impact of multi - user diversity on the mimo downlink channel ( bc ) . assuming channel state information at the bs , the authors used order statistics to evaluate the effective snr when scheduling the strongest user in each slot .",
    "however , _ only one user was scheduled _ in each slot , and the results were given in terms of the @xmath2-fold statistics , without an extreme value analysis for large @xmath2 .    in @xcite ,",
    "a similar downlink model was considered , however , when users are scheduled simultaneously .",
    "the authors considered zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) , and suggested a greedy algorithm to schedule the strongest and most orthogonal users .",
    "additional scheduling algorithms for downlink communication were given in @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the downlink scenario , it was shown later that zfbf and optimal user selection can indeed achieve the dirty paper coding ( dpc ) region @xcite , and is hence optimal in the gaussian case @xcite .",
    "additional surveys and scaling laws can be found in @xcite .    a closely related scheme , yet still for the downlink model , was suggested in @xcite . using block diagonalization ( bd ) ,",
    "a capacity - based greedy algorithm was suggested , in which first the strongest user is scheduled , and then additional users are added , one by one , based on their marginal contribution to the total capacity . in the same context ,",
    "@xcite considered the special case of two transmit antennas and one receive antenna per user , and showed that a greedy , two - stage algorithm , which first selects the strongest user and then the second to form the best pair is asymptotically optimal . in the context of heterogeneous users",
    ", @xcite proposed a scheduling scheme which selects a small subset of the users with favorable channel characteristics .",
    "the above works focus on the downlink setting . in this scenario ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at least some information is available at the bs , and a centralized decision can be made . in the uplink ( mac ) model , however , if one wishes to select a group of users without centralized processing at the bs , distributed algorithms are required . in this paper , we suggest both a single - stage distributed algorithm , and a multi - stage semi - distributed one for the uplink scenario , and , in addition , analyze their sum capacity in the limit of large number of users and give the resulting scaling laws .    a pioneering study of the uplink model was done in @xcite , where a decentralized mac protocol for orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) channels was suggested . in this scheme , each user estimates the channel gain and compares it to a threshold .",
    "only above - the - threshold users can transmit .",
    "@xcite extended the scheme to a multi - channel setup , where each user competes on @xmath3 channels . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used a similar approach for power allocation in the multi - channel setup , and suggested an algorithm that asymptotically achieves the optimal water filling solution .",
    "however , the works above do not consider a _ mimo setting _ , nor do they consider the interaction within a group of users , when all are scheduled to use _ the same resources_. space - time coding for fading multi - antenna mac was considered in @xcite . the focus therein , however , was on joint code design for a given point in the rate region and the resulting error probability , rather than user scheduling and its resulting capacity .",
    "recently , we proposed a point process approximation which facilitates the analysis of various distributed threshold - based scheduling algorithms in the non - homogeneous scenario @xcite .",
    "this work , however , assumed only a single user can be successfully decoded in each time slot .",
    "a key contribution of the current work is the non - trivial extension of the work in @xcite to truly multiple - access protocols , where several users transmit simultaneously and should be decoded successfully , hence the questions that arise are how to distributively select a good subset of users to transmit and what the mutual influence between the users in the selected group is .",
    "for example , a closely related work is @xcite .",
    "therein , various decoding procedures were discussed , and the corresponding best user selection _ for the uplink setting _ was given . however , while reinforcing the necessity of proper user selection , the work in @xcite considered only the scenario where _ one user _ can access the radio channel at a given time .",
    "as for more complex topologies , spatial diversity in the context of multiple relays was considered in @xcite .",
    "therein , communication between a source and a destination is done through a group of relays .",
    "however , unlike conventional relay schemes , only the relays with the _ strongest received signal _ decode the message and cooperate via space time coding to successfully relay it to the destination . an asymptotically optimal scheme for multiple base stations ( with joint optimization )",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "extreme value theory ( evt ) is a key tool in proving capacity results under scheduling and multi - user diversity . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors suggested a sub - carrier assignment algorithm , and used order statistics to derive an expression for the resulting link outage probability . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used evt to derive the scaling laws for scheduling systems using beamforming and linear combining .",
    "@xcite analyzed the scaling laws of base station scheduling , and showed that by scheduling the strongest among @xmath2 stations one can gain a factor of @xmath4 in the expected capacity ( compared to random or round - robin scheduling ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the system model and relevant results which will be used throughout this paper .      throughout this paper , random matrices and random vectors",
    "are denoted in bold upper - case and bold lower - case letters , respectively .",
    "we consider a multiple - access model with k users , each with a single transmit antenna . the bs is equipped with @xmath0 receiving antennas .",
    "when @xmath5 users utilize the channel simultaneously , the received signal at the base station can be described as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transmitted signal ( scalar ) .",
    "@xmath8 is constrained in its total power to @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10\\leq p$ ] . however , in most cases , we will assume a _",
    "constant _ power constraint @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "@xmath12 is a complex random gaussian channel vector . when all users are identically and independently distributed , it is common to assume that all entries of @xmath13 are independent and have zero mean and variance @xmath14 imaginary and real parts , for all users .",
    "we assume that the channel is memoryless , that is , for each channel use ( slot ) , independent realizations of @xmath15 are drawn .",
    "furthermore , we assume full csi is available at the transmitter .",
    "that is , @xmath13 is known to the @xmath16th user .",
    "this can be accomplished by sending a pilot signal form each of the @xmath0 antennas at the base station .",
    "evt is a key tool in evaluating the capacity under scheduling in multi - user systems .",
    "we review here the most relevant result .",
    "moreover , we develop new normalizing constants for the problem at hand ( evt for the @xmath17 distribution ) , which will later aid at speeding up convergence results .    the capacity obtained by letting an arbitrary user @xmath16 utilize the channel is given by @xmath18 . however , as mentioned , it is beneficial to schedule the strongest user in each slot .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the received channel vector with the largest norm .",
    "scheduling the strongest user clearly results in @xmath20 , while letting a _ group of @xmath0 orthogonal users _ , with the largest channel gains to utilize an uplink channel , results in a sum - rate that has the following upper bound:@xmath21    for the downlink channel , the sum - rate upper bound has the form  @xcite @xmath22 the difference between the uplink to the downlink originates in the power constraint applied to the transmitter .",
    "that is , in the downstream , when transmitting to a group of receivers , each receiver gets a share of the available power , while in the upstream , there is a group of transmitters that transmit to a single receiver .",
    "it should be noted that usually the power constraint @xmath9 for the downlink and uplink are not equal , since the base station has a strong and steady power supply , whereas the user has a limited battery power supply .",
    "as the sum rate is mainly influenced by the channel vectors gains and directions , our goal is to explore this behavior for large number of users .",
    "specifically , we first wish to explore the behavior of the maximal gain .",
    "since the entries of @xmath23 are complex gaussian , the channel s gain follows a @xmath17 distribution with @xmath24 degrees of freedom , denoted @xmath25 .",
    "we utilize the following evt theorem .",
    "[ theorem .",

    "@xmath25 random variables ,",
    "the convergence of the maxima to the gumbel distribution using the above normalizing constants is quite slow .",

    "the mmse receiver , however , although still linear , maximizes the mutual information and hence achieves better performance ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this receiver , to decode the @xmath82 data stream , the receiver treats the rest of the streams as noise .",

    "a common approach to select a single user distributively , is a threshold - based procedure , in which a capacity threshold is set , and only a user who exceeds it transmits ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the events in which none of the users or several users exceed the threshold should be taken into account . in this paper , however , we wish to select a group of users , and analyze the resulting capacity .    at the heart of the algorithms",
    "we suggest herein , stands a similar threshold - based procedure . however , the challenge is twofold .",
    "first , in selecting a threshold such that a favorable _ group of users _ exceed it .",
    "second , in analyzing the results under the various decoding procedures and at the limit of large @xmath2 .",
    "when doing this , a few important questions arise : on which variable should a threshold be set and how many users will pass it ? how can one assess the mutual interference between the users which passed ? what will be the loss in this distributed procedure compared to the optimal , centralized one ?    in the next three sections , we answer the above questions .",
    "we set a threshold on the _ channel norms _ , and analyze the resulting exceedance rate .",
    "we further analyze the mutual interference , in terms of the _ angles _ between the exceeding users , and conclude by analysing the resulting _ sum capacity _ , showing that a distributed algorithm can achieve the _",
    "same scaling laws _ as a centralized one .    in particular ,",
    "we suggest two distributed algorithms . in the first ,",
    "described in this section , a single threshold is utilized when decoding is done using linear decorrelation . in the second , described in section  [ sec .",
    "sic ] , we offer a _ set of thresholds _ to match a successive interference cancellation ( sic ) procedure .    given the number of users @xmath2 , we set a threshold @xmath88 on the norm @xmath89 , such that @xmath90 strongest users exceed it on average . in each slot , each user estimates its channel s norm .",
    "a user with a norm greater than the threshold , transmits .",
    "we assume the transmission includes the channel vector as a low - rate preamble so the bs has the csi _ of the transmitting users_. the algorithm for user @xmath16 is given in figure  [ alg .",
    "channel access ] .",
    "note that the receiver can not recover more than @xmath0 data streams .",
    "that is , since for more than @xmath0 users the performance ( both under zf decoding and mmse decoding in section [ sec .",
    "mmse rec ] ) deteriorates significantly , if more than @xmath0 users begin transmission simultaneously , we assume a collision occurs and the whole slot is lost ( zero capacity ) .",
    "similarly , since users act independently , a slot might be idle , if no user exceeded the threshold .",
    "thus , we say that a slot is utilized if at least one user , but no more than @xmath0 users , are transmitting .",
    "the first result , proposition  [ c zf uniform users exact ] below , gives the sum capacity under the above distributed user selection algorithm and zf decoding .",
    "note that this simple proposition still includes an expectation on the channel vectors seen by the users , hence can not give the understanding we wish regarding the sum capacity under the suggested algorithm .",
    "still , it will be the starting point , from which we will derive the bounds which give the right insight and scaling laws .",
    "[ c zf uniform users exact ] for @xmath1 , the expected sum capacity of algorithm channel - access with zf decoding is given by @xmath91 + o\\left(\\frac{\\log \\log k}{k}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , to be optimized , is the expected number of users to exceed the threshold @xmath88 , the @xmath92 are the channel vectors of the users who exceeded the threshold and @xmath93 are the corresponding null spaces .",
    "according to the law of total probability , we express the expected capacity in a slot by summing over the number of users who exceed the threshold , and the sum capacity these users see , given that they exceeded the threshold .",
    "as mentioned , if more than @xmath0 users are transmitting in a slot , the receiver can not successfully null the inter - stream interference , and the capacity in that slot is zero .",
    "hence , the expected capacity has the form : @xmath94.\\ ] ] when the users are i.i.d . , the probability of @xmath73 threshold exceedances follows the binomial distribution with probability @xmath95 to exceed the threshold .",
    "since we consider large @xmath2 and small values of @xmath5 , the number of users to exceed threshold can be approximated by the poisson distribution with an approximation error in the order of @xmath96 .",
    "this is based on the poisson point process approximation developed in @xcite for the single - user scenario . in short ,",
    "this method gives a poisson approximation for the number of users exceeding a high threshold @xmath88 .",
    "however , as this approximation error is within the sum , it is multiplied by the individual capacities , which scales like the optimal scaling law of the multi - user diversity when a single , strongest user , is scheduled , i.e. , @xmath97 ( see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath98 approximation error .",
    "finally , note that the number of exceeding users @xmath73 affects the effective snr seen by the attending users .",
    "in particular , when @xmath73 users exceed threshold , the dimension of @xmath99 is @xmath100 .",
    "thus , as @xmath73 decreases , the signal of the attending users is projected on a less restrictive null - space .",
    "accordingly , each stream may spread on more receiving antennas in the zf process , which leads to a higher power gain ( for details on zf decoding , see @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the reader should not be confused .",

    "the @xmath98 approximation error is omitted from now on .    to evaluate the result in proposition  [",
    "c zf uniform users exact ] , the behavior of @xmath101 should be understood , especially considering the fact that the number of users exceeding the threshold is random . to this end , the following upper and lower bounds are useful .",
    "these bounds will be the basis of the scaling laws we derive .",
    "[ c zf uniform users upper ] the expected sum capacity of algorithm channel - access with zf decoding satisfies the following upper bound @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given by and @xmath88 is the threshold set such that @xmath5 users exceed it on average .    the bound in lemma  [ c zf uniform users upper ] , while not giving the exact capacity , still depicts the essence of the system behavior . to understand its implications , we note the following : we set a threshold such that @xmath5 out of the @xmath2 users exceed it on average .",
    "i.e. , the average exceedance rate is @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the expression @xmath104 in the sum over @xmath73 gives the probability for exactly @xmath73 users exceeding .",
    "each of the @xmath73 users , under zero forcing , experiences a single user channel , with its power @xmath9 scaled according to two factors : ( i ) a multiplication by @xmath105 , as this is the average norm of its channel vector , where @xmath88 is the threshold exceeded , and @xmath106 is the average distance _ above _ the threshold .",
    "( ii ) a multiplication by @xmath107 , as in case only @xmath108 users exceeded the threshold , the zero forcing algorithm does not have to cancel @xmath109 users , only @xmath110 , hence the null space has a larger dimension , yet the number of receive antennas is @xmath0 .",
    "as the threshold @xmath111 will be shown to be @xmath112 , the optimal scaling law will follow .",
    "a complete discussion will be given after the lower bound is introduced .",
    "indeed , as it turns out in the simulation results , the bound in lemma  [ c zf uniform users upper ] is tight even for relatively small number of antennas and users .",
    "note , however , that if less than @xmath0 users exceed , as a higher snr can be attained at the receiver , in order to achieve the capacity in this case , a user must know how many users exceeded , so it can exploit the high snr for , e.g. , higher transmission rate .",
    "hence , we require that the number of users that actually exceeded the threshold will be announced .",
    "note that in practice it is beneficial to choose @xmath5 slightly smaller than the number of antennas @xmath0 .",
