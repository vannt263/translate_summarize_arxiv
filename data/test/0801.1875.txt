    "the standard picture of the basic cosmological framework has recently come to rest firmly on detailed empirical evidence regarding the cosmological parameters , the proportions of baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter , together with the overall shape and normalization of the power spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this framework has become the standard @xmath1cdm cosmological model , with the added simple assumptions that the dark matter reacts only to gravity , is initially sub - relativistic , and possesses initial density perturbations which are gaussian distributed in amplitude .",
    "this is a very well defined and relatively simple model , with clear predictions which are amenable to examination with observations .",
    "the cooling history of baryons complicates the interpretation of dark matter on galaxy scales , especially for dwarf galaxies that traditionally have been a major focus of studies of halo structure .",
    "clusters have the advantage that the virial temperature of the associated gas is too hot for efficient cooling , so the majority of the baryons must trace the overall gravitational potential and hence we may safely compare lensing - based cluster mass measurements to theoretical predictions that neglect gas physics and feedback .",
    "lensing - based determinations of the mass profiles of galaxy clusters rely on detailed modeling of the strong lensing region to define the inner mass profile , and also a careful analysis of the outer weak lensing regime .",
    "the latter involves substantial corrections for instrumental and atmospheric effects @xcite , and a clear definition of the background , free of contamination by the lensing cluster @xcite . in the center",
    "we may make use of the einstein radius of a cluster which is often readily visible from the presence of giant arcs and provides a relatively model - independent determination of the central mass density . in the case of axial symmetry ,",
    "the projected mass inside the einstein radius @xmath5 depends only on fundamental and cosmological constants : @xmath6 , where this combination of angular diameter distances ( observer - lens , observer - source , and lens - source ) leads to a relatively weak dependence on the lens and source redshifts .",
    "more generally , an effective einstein radius can be defined by axially averaging the projected surface density , which itself is well determined when there are a large number of constraints .",
    "virtually all known massive clusters at intermediate redshifts , @xmath7 , show multiple images including obvious arcs in sufficiently deep high - resolution data .",
    "the derived einstein radius of these massive clusters typically falls in the range @xmath8 @xcite , with the largest known case of @xmath9 for a1689 .",
    "increasingly large simulations have helped to specify the evolution of the halo mass function and the form of the mass profile predicted in the context of the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "these simulations are now becoming sufficiently large and detailed to define the predicted spread of halo structure over a wide range of halo mass , and to quantitatively assess the inherent bias in observing clusters in projection and selecting them by lensing cross - section @xcite .",
    "for the most massive collapsed objects in these simulations ( virial mass @xmath10 ) , a mean observed concentration of @xmath11 is predicted for lenses , where @xmath12 is defined precisely in the next section .",
    "such profiles are relatively shallow and seem at odds with recent careful lensing studies of massive clusters ; although the @xcite ( hereafter nfw ) profile provides acceptable fits to the observations , relatively high concentrations of @xmath13 are derived for several well - studied massive clusters @xcite .",
    "these values are larger than expected based on simulations of the standard @xmath1cdm model . given the relatively shallow mass profile predicted for cluster - mass cdm halos , the question arises whether the projected critical surface density for lensing can be exceeded within a substantial radius for this model .    in this paper",
    "we compare observations of well - constrained massive clusters with the predictions of @xmath1cdm simulations .",
    "the idea is to compare directly the projected 2-d mass distributions in the observations and the simulations . in the observations , the projected surface density is obtained from the lensing analysis , which we emphasize does not assume any symmetry of the lensing mass . in the simulations ,",
    "the 2-d density is directly measurable from the simulation outputs .",
    "we summarize each 2-d density distribution with two defined quantities , the virial mass and the effective einstein radius . in the simulations ,",
    "the 2-d density distribution of each halo was already axially averaged by fitting to a projected nfw profile , so we use this profile to obtain the effective @xmath5 ( which , consistently , is also defined through an axial average ) . the virial mass is measured directly in the simulations ( with its usual spherically - averaged definition ) . in the observations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath14 directly in a1689 ( though in projection ) , and measure it using nfw fits to the final distribution in the other clusters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "2 we first summarize the theoretical predictions , including a brief review of the nfw profile and its lensing properties , and of the halo concentrations measured by @xcite and @xcite in large numerical simulations . note that the conflict between high observed concentrations and lower ones determined for the numerical halos was noted in both of these papers",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we then present the observational data for the four clusters , followed by a model - independent method for measuring the mass , which we apply to a1689 . in section  3",
    "we confront the theoretical predictions with the data , finding a clear discrepancy .",
    "we discuss the possible implications in section  4 .",

    "we derive the theoretical predictions for cluster lensing in @xmath1cdm by combining the two largest studies of halo structure in cosmological numerical simulations .",

    "each halo was resolved with @xmath49 particles , allowing a detailed look at its three - dimensional density structure using nfw profile fitting .",
    "this is therefore the best available statistical analysis of the cluster halo population in @xmath1cdm simulations .",
    "however , since @xcite did not study projected halo profiles or the bias in selecting lenses , we must adjust their results in order to apply them to lensing .",
    "@xcite studied 900 simulated cluster halos at @xmath50 , each resolved into at least @xmath51 particles .",
    "they studied projections through on average 15 random directions per cluster ( more  up to 125  for the most massive ones ) , and fit both 3-d and projected 2-d nfw profiles .",
    "moreover , they separately studied the distribution of nfw profile parameters both for the general halo population and for the lensing population ( i.e. , where halos are weighted by their strong lensing cross section ) .",
    "they showed that the inherent triaxiality of cdm halos along with the presence of substructure enhance the projected mass in some orientations , leading to a bias in the 2-d structure of lenses compared with the 3-d structure of the general population of cluster halos ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hennawi ] shows various biases in halo concentration parameters @xmath36 as measured by @xcite .",
    "the figure shows ( left panel ) that the distribution of 3-d concentrations of the lens population is the same as that of the general halo population except for a shift upwards by a factor of 1.17 . for a given real 3-d profile ,",
    "the 2-d profile measured in projection depends on the orientation , and is thus given by a probability distribution .",
    "the figure also shows ( right panel ) that the ratio @xmath52 follows a lognormal distribution , i.e. , that @xmath53 of this ratio is well fitted by a gaussian with a mean value of 0.057 and @xmath54 , which correspond to factors of 1.14 and 1.33 , respectively .",
    "of the ratio of the 2-d to the 3-d concentration ( solid histogram ) is well fitted by a gaussian with the same mean and variance as the histogram ( dashed curve ) .",
    "note that the non - uniform binning is a result of our conversion of the linear - axis histogram from figure  12 of @xcite to one with a logarithmic @xmath55-axis.,width=317 ]    at @xmath50 , @xmath38 and @xmath12 are typically @xmath56 smaller than @xmath37 and @xmath36 , respectively , and @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that the _ relative _ distributions shown in figure  [ fig : hennawi ] are approximately the same for @xmath12 as for @xmath36 , and that they are independent of halo mass within the narrow range considered , as found by @xcite .",
    "thus , we can apply these findings to convert the 3-d @xmath12 distributions measured by @xcite in order to obtain the resulting 2-d projected distributions of @xmath12 values for the population of cluster lenses .",
    "specifically , we multiply the @xmath12 values by a factor of 1.17 ( the lensing bias ) and then convolve with the distribution of @xmath58 for lenses ( the projection bias ) . note that we use the values measured by @xcite at @xmath48 when comparing to the observed clusters at redshifts @xmath59 .",
    "this is a conservative assumption , since the typical concentration parameter at a given halo mass declines with redshift .",
    "studies based on large numerical simulations @xcite found for massive halos a relatively weak decline of @xmath60 out to @xmath61 , which suggests a @xmath62 decline out to the redshifts we consider below , a decline which we do not include here .    in figure  [ fig : netomean ] we show the predicted einstein radii of @xmath1cdm cluster halos of mass @xmath63 based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite divided their halos within each mass bin into `` relaxed '' and `` unrelaxed '' groups of halos , the latter identified as being disturbed dynamically as indicated by a large amount of substructure , a large offset between the center of mass and the potential center , or a high kinetic energy relative to potential .",
    "for each group , they found that the statistical distribution of the concentration parameters was well - fitted by a lognormal distribution .",
    "thus , after correcting for lensing and projection bias as explained above , the resulting distributions remain lognormal .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : netomean ] , the median @xmath12 of each group is only weakly dependent on mass , showing a slight trend of decreasing concentration with increasing halo mass ( a trend which is more apparent over the broader range considered by @xcite , down to @xmath64 ) . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath65 ( relaxed ) and @xmath66 ( unrelaxed ) .",
    "note that for a lognormal distribution , the median and mean are theoretically the same if @xmath67 is considered rather than @xmath12 . as the figure shows , the typical scatter in @xmath67 among halos of the same mass is also fairly independent of mass , except for the highest mass bin , @xmath68 .",
    "while this bin is based on a somewhat small sample ( 8 relaxed and 11 unrelaxed halos ) , @xcite suggest that the lower dispersion is expected since the highest - mass halos are very rare , thus all formed very recently and should have similar merger histories and thus internal structures .",
    "note that the final , effective scatter in our calculations is only @xmath69 lower for the last bin compared with the lower mass bins , since we assume that the projection scatter is independent of halo mass .",

    "we assume the median @xmath12 and the a1689 redshifts when calculating @xmath71 .",

    "we determine an effective einstein radius in each cluster using the 2-d projected mass distribution obtained from fitting ( without assuming symmetry ) to the large number of sets of multiple images ; from the obtained @xmath40 we then define @xmath5 in the standard way , as the radius enclosing a mean surface density equal to the critical surface density for lensing .",
    "note that this definition effectively axially averages the mass distribution .",
    "we can define @xmath5 relative to any source redshift , and in each cluster we choose a fiducial redshift that matches a prominent arc system .",
    "our procedure for determining @xmath5 is also a good match to that followed by @xcite for their simulated clusters , where they fit an axially symmetric model to the projected mass distribution ; we obtain the predicted effective einstein radii of the simulated clusters based on their model fits , as detailed in the previous subsection . for the observed clusters , we also obtain effective virial masses from combined axially - symmetric fits to the strong and weak lensing data .",
    "very deep hst / acs imaging of several massive lensing clusters has been obtained by the acs / gto team @xcite .",
    "this includes the well - studied cluster a1689 @xmath72 for which several comprehensive strong lensing analyses have been published .",
    "the analysis of @xcite identified over 100 multiply lensed images of 30 background galaxies by an iterative procedure in which multiple images are securely identified by delensing and relensing background galaxies .",
    "these multiple images have been used as a basis for other types of modeling , including fully parametric @xcite and non - parametric modeling @xcite .",
    "@xcite combined these data on the inner mass profile with wide field archival subaru images and obtained a detailed radial mass profile for the entire cluster , finding an nfw - like projected mass profile with a surprisingly high value for the concentration parameter ( @xmath73 ) , and a virial mass of @xmath74 ( the value in table  1 is different ; see the next subsection ) .",
    "this yields an effective einstein radius of @xmath75 at a fiducial redshift @xmath76 , in good agreement with the radius of @xmath9 found for prominent multiple arcs at this redshift .",
    "we adopt a conservative error estimate of @xmath77 on @xmath5 for all the clusters ( table  1 ) .",
    "note that an einstein radius of only @xmath78 is implied by the nfw fit of @xcite to independent weak lensing data from cfht , but this number is incompatible with their own strong lensing analysis and is possibly caused by contamination of the lensing signal by unlensed cluster members ; if not thoroughly excluded , this contamination will reduce the lensing signal preferentially towards the cluster center , resulting in a flatter mass profile , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    ".observational data [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     another well studied cluster that we use here is cl0024 - 17 ( @xmath79 ) , with an effective einstein radius of @xmath78 at @xmath80 defined by several sets of multiple images identified in the acs / gto images .",
    "this agrees in particular with the mean radius of the famous 5-image system of `` @xmath81 '' arcs at a spectroscopically measured redshift of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this set of multiple images and the distortion measurements of background galaxies with photometric redshifts has been used by @xcite to constrain the inner mass profile .",
    "their result is in general consistent in form with the earlier analysis of the inner profile by @xcite , but with the addition of a narrow low - contrast ring that , it is claimed , can be reproduced in simulations where merging of two massive clusters occurs along the line of sight .",
    "a line - of - sight merger is also blamed for the relatively small central velocity dispersion @xcite . however , in the extensive weak lensing analysis of @xcite only one small subgroup is visible , offset by @xmath83 in projection from the center of mass and accounting for only @xmath56 of the total mass of the cluster .",
    "@xcite find that the main cluster is well fitted by an nfw profile with a virial mass of @xmath84 and with a high concentration , @xmath85 . in a more recent analysis of deep multicolour b , r , z subaru images ,",

    "in addition , we use the very deep acs / gto images of the massive cluster a1703 for which many sets of multiple images are visible , so that the tangential critical line is easily identified with a mean einstein radius of @xmath86 at @xmath87 , in good agreement with the radius of the main giant arc at a similar redshift ( table  1 ) . in the weak lensing analysis of medezinski et  al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) a very good fit to an nfw profile is found with a virial mass @xmath88 .",
    "this cluster appears relaxed and centrally concentrated , with little obvious substructure . to date",
    ", deep x - ray imaging is unfortunately missing .    finally , a weak lensing analysis of rxj1347 ( medezinski et  al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) shows this cluster to have a very circular shear pattern , with an estimated virial mass @xmath89 based on an nfw fit to the radial distortion profile .",
    "this cluster has the highest observed x - ray temperature of 13 kev and a symmetric x - ray emission map that indicates that it is relaxed @xcite .",
    "a very symmetric distribution of arcs is visible around the cluster center , implying a well - determined einstein radius at @xmath90 of @xmath91 from the full model , a value which is also in agreement with a system of 5 multiply - lensed images at this redshift @xcite .",
    "these four clusters are particularly useful for our purpose , by virtue of their well - defined einstein radii and precise measurements of the virial masses , which allows a comparison with the theoretical predictions as a function of halo mass .",
    "we convert @xmath14 to @xmath39 for each cluster using the measured value of @xmath36 , and adopt error bars of @xmath92 on @xmath39 and @xmath93 on @xmath5 for all four clusters ( but see the next subsection for an alternative measurement of the virial mass of a1689 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note the many examples of strong lensing by other galaxy clusters for which the total mass is not so well constrained .",
    "samples of clusters defined by some reasonable criteria @xcite show that invariably the observed einstein radius ( when detected ) for intermediate redshift clusters does not fall short of @xmath94 , with a mean of @xmath95 .",
    "this may be compared with the predicted typical einstein radius of only @xmath96 from the simulations of @xcite and @xcite for a cluster of @xmath97  several  @xmath98 ( figure  [ fig : netomean ] ) .",
    "of the two observational quantities we use to characterize each cluster , @xmath5 is more directly estimated , from the positions of multiple images .",
    "the mass @xmath39 requires a measured mass profile out to large angles , which can be used to estimate the angular position corresponding to @xmath38 , i.e. , to an enclosed relative density of 200 times the critical density .",
    "deep images provide a large density of weakly - lensed background sources , but weak lensing distortions measure only the reduced shear and suffer from the well - known mass - sheet degeneracy .",
    "this means that the mass profile can be measured without degeneracies only by fitting a particular parametrized density profile model to the data .",
    "however , combining lensing distortions with observations of the variation in the number density of background sources due to weak magnification breaks the degeneracy and yields a direct measurement of the projected surface density in each radial bin @xcite . given such independent measurements out to large radius",
    ", we can derive the corresponding value of @xmath39 directly from the data , without the intermediary of an assumed model profile , the use of which inevitably introduces a non - trivial systematic error .",
    "such accurate measurements are available for a1689 , which we use to illustrate the method , and such data should be obtainable for other clusters as well .",
    "we note that this effective virial mass is defined from deprojecting the projected mass assuming spherical symmetry , which is the closest lensing observations can come to the standard theoretical definition of the virial mass based on a 3-d spherical average .",
    "lensing by a halo can be analyzed by calculating @xmath99 .",
    "the projected surface density is related to the three - dimensional density @xmath100 by an abel integral transform .",
    "this implies a relation between the integrated three - dimensional mass @xmath101 out to radius @xmath102 and @xmath103 as a function of the projected radius @xmath43 : m(r ) = _ cr , [ eq : m ] where f(x)= - tan^-1  .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eq : m ] ) is the total projected mass within a ring of projected radius @xmath102 , and the second term removes the contribution from mass elements lying at a 3-d radius greater than @xmath102 .    to obtain the 3-d mass profile @xmath101",
    ", we apply equation  ( [ eq : m ] ) to the 26 values of @xmath103 measured by @xcite over the range @xmath104 mpc in a1689 .",
    "specifically , we linearly interpolate @xmath103 between each pair of measured points , and extrapolate outside the range . we extrapolate inward assuming @xmath105 from the innermost point and outward assuming @xmath106 from the outermost point , where these power laws are motivated by the nfw profile .",
    "however , even varying these powers by @xmath107 would change the virial mass by only @xmath108 , which is negligible compared with the effect of the measurement errors .",
    "once we have obtained @xmath101 at all @xmath102 , we interpolate to find the appropriate @xmath102 that yields a desired mean enclosed density , and thus determine the virial radius and mass",
    ". the error analysis is complicated by the fact that the virial radius is not fixed but rather is itself determined by the data .",
    "thus , to ensure self - consistent errors we use a monte carlo approach , generating 1000 random profiles of @xmath103 according to the measurement errors ( assumed to be gaussian distributed except that @xmath40 is constrained to be non - negative ) . for each @xmath103 profile we find the resulting virial quantities , and then find the @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( median ) , and @xmath111 percentiles .",
    "the result of this direct , model - independent analysis of a1689 is : @xmath112 @xmath113    the median value obtained for @xmath39 is lower by @xmath56 than the best - fit value from the nfw profile .",
    "this is consistent with our model - independent analysis of a1689 in @xcite , where we found that the nfw fit clearly overshoots the observed density profile at large radii . also , the model - independent error of @xmath114 is larger since assuming an nfw profile puts a constraint on the density fluctuations and yields a reduced error .",
    "the @xmath115 error results from allowing completely independent variations in the @xmath40 measurements at different radii , so the error would be reduced with even a weak assumption of smoothness in the density profile . here",
    "we adopt the model - independent mass along with its conservatively large @xmath115 error ( table  1 ) .",
    "the model - independent mass is the most reliable observationally - determined mass and is more consistent with a comparison to numerical simulations , where the real virial masses are known without the need to resort to profile fitting .",
    "the most important assumption in our analysis is spherical symmetry .",
    "since the measured @xmath40 profile goes out to @xmath116 , what we directly measure includes the full contribution of @xmath39 plus additional projected mass coming from larger radii .",
    "if the halo has non - spherical structure such as triaxiality , then lensing bias means that the contribution of mass elements outside the virial radius to the projected mass will tend to be unusually high in our direction .",
    "however , since we get that contribution by extrapolating from the measured @xmath40 points ( which are also enhanced by lensing bias ) , the error in our spherical assumption may be small .",
    "the real conclusion is that since the 3-d virial mass is not directly observable , lensing analyses of halos in numerical simulations should measure the effective , projected ` virial ' mass defined by applying equation  ( [ eq : m ] ) to the projected profile .",
    "this would allow a truly direct comparison with the observations .",
    "for each cluster with known redshifts @xmath117 and @xmath118 and a reliably measured value of @xmath39 , we can use the results of section  2.1 to calculate the predicted value of @xmath5 in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "figure  [ fig : reofz ] compares the median expected value with the observed value for each cluster , showing that in each case the theoretical expectation falls short of the observed value by about a factor of two . specifically , the predicted einstein radii are 24@xmath119 , 15@xmath119 , 16@xmath119 , and 23@xmath119 , for a1689 , cl0024 , a1703 , and rxj1347 , respectively . in this figure",
    "we also separately illustrate the dependence of the predicted @xmath5 on the source and lens redshifts .",

    "is maximized at a particular value of @xmath117 , which for the @xmath118 values of our four clusters falls at @xmath117 between 0.3 and 0.6 .",
    "the overall dependence of @xmath5 is weak , illustrating that the discrepancy between the theory and the observations would not be significantly affected by small changes in the redshifts .     on the redshifts @xmath118 ( left panel ) and @xmath117 ( right panel ) .",

    "we have used the relaxed halo population from @xcite . as the figure shows , including the unrelaxed halos would only strengthen the inconsistency with the observations .",
    "the results from @xcite are uncertain due to the relatively small halo samples used .",

    "figure  [ fig : netodist ] shows the result of increasing the standard deviation by its 1-@xmath4 sampling error ; increasing the mean by its 1-@xmath4 error would have a smaller effect . while larger simulations will reduce the sampling noise , the figure shows that this uncertainty is already smaller than the effect of the measurement errors in the cluster masses .    , assuming the lognormal @xmath12 distribution measured by @xcite for halos from a numerical simulation .",
    "we consider a1689 , cl0024 , a1703 , and rxj1347 as indicated , assuming in each case the best - fit mass from observations , and the @xmath12 distribution as measured from the simulation for the nearest mass bin of relaxed halos ( solid curves ) .",
    "we also consider several possible sources of statistical or systematic error , and we illustrate the result of assuming a cluster mass higher by the 1-@xmath4 measurement error ( dotted curves ) , or a scatter @xmath70 higher by the 1-@xmath4 sampling noise ( see text ; long - dashed curves ) . in all cases shown , @xmath129 for unrelaxed halos would lie below the corresponding curve for relaxed halos , throughout the plotted region .",
    "thus , we only illustrate the main case with the @xmath12 distribution as measured for unrelaxed halos ( short - dashed curves ) . also shown for comparison for each cluster ( dotted vertical line )",
    "is the observed @xmath5.,width=317 ]    including the rather conservative observational uncertainties that we have assumed in @xmath39 and @xmath5 , and averaging over gaussian error distributions in these two observables , we obtain probabilities of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , for agreement between the @xmath1cdm simulations and a1689 , cl0024 , a1703 , and rxj1347 , respectively .",
    "if we considered just one of the clusters , the large einstein radius problem would only constitute around a 2-@xmath4 discrepancy .",
    "however , we have four independent objects selected from the population of cluster lenses , and all four are discrepant ( in the same direction ) .",
    "the total probability of the theoretical prediction yielding four clusters with such large values of @xmath5 is @xmath134 , which corresponds to a 4-@xmath4 discrepancy .",
    "we emphasize that we have included in this calculation the lensing and projection biases , as well as the measurement errors in the cluster masses and einstein radii .",
    "we have presented perhaps the clearest , most robust current conflict between observations and the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this model is highly successful in fitting large scale structure measurements , which in turn strongly constrain the free parameters of the model and thus produce precise predictions for comparison with data on smaller scales .",
    "structure on these scales is non - linear and potentially affected by gas physics , but clusters provide perhaps the best opportunity for a robust comparison between the models and the theory .",
    "clusters are so large and massive that their evolution is dominated by gravity , especially since their high virial temperature prevents most of the intracluster gas from cooling",
    ". the evolution of clusters including gravitational collapse and virialization can now be accurately numerically simulated , with sufficient resolution for studying cluster structure and for simulating lensing in projection , and in sufficient volumes to produce large samples in a cosmological context . at the same time , observations of clusters combining weak and strong lensing now produce accurate virial mass determinations . given the virial mass , the cleanest measure of the halo structure is the effective einstein radius , which is easily obtained observationally from a model constrained by large numbers of arcs and directly measures the central mass density .",
    "we derived the theoretical predictions for cluster lensing in @xmath1cdm using the distribution of 3-d halo profiles measured by @xcite in the millennium simulation , after correcting it for lensing and projection biases based on @xcite .",
    "these analyses of numerical samples expressed halo structure in terms of the nfw concentration parameter .",
    "we found two key results ( figure  [ fig : hennawi ] ) based on the halo analysis by @xcite : first , that the distribution of 3-d concentrations of the lens population is the same as that of the general halo population except for a shift upwards by a factor of 1.17 ; and second , that the concentrations measured in projection are related to the 3-d concentrations , such that the ratio follows a lognormal distribution which corresponds to a factor of 1.14 shift plus a factor of 1.33 spread . the concentration parameter is higher for relaxed halos than for unrelaxed , and it declines slowly with halo mass , resulting in a predicted einstein radius that increases roughly linearly with mass for relaxed halos ( figure  [ fig : netomean ] ) .",
    ", obtained by integrating the halo mass function of @xcite over our past light cone .",
    "we consider all cluster halos above virial mass @xmath135 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or @xmath136 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "also listed for each @xmath32 ( top - right corner ) is the redshift above which there is a @xmath110 chance of observing at least one halo of mass greater than @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath137 we instead list the probability of observing at least one halo at any @xmath138.,width=317 ]    we compared the theoretical predictions with the observed @xmath5 for four clusters , a1689 , cl0024 , a1703 , and rxj1347 . for the latter three we used the virial mass as given by nfw fits to the lensing observations , but for a1689 we obtained a model - independent mass directly from the lensing data , only assuming spherical symmetry ( section  2.3 ) . for each object ,",
    "the predicted @xmath5 values came up short by a factor of two compared with the observations ( figure  [ fig : reofz ] ) . after including the measurement errors , the full probability distribution functions of the predicted einstein radii excluded the theoretical model at 2-@xmath4 for each object .",
    "the total probability of the standard @xmath1cdm model yielding four clusters with such large @xmath5 is @xmath139 , a 4-@xmath4 discrepancy .",
    "lensing work is now being extended to larger samples of clusters , so that in the near future we may examine more fully the relation between the einstein radius and virial mass and its scatter , over a wider range of cluster masses .",
    "the theoretically predicted triaxiality of cdm halos implies a particular scatter in the projected concentration parameter ( and thus in the einstein radius ) for a given halo mass .",
    "this scatter , which we included in our calculations , is apparently insufficient to explain the observations .",
    "if the scatter is observationally determined to be relatively small , then this would further highlight the problem we have discussed and leave the high concentrations unexplained .",
    "determining the scatter observationally will also statistically probe the degree of triaxiality of cdm halos . to ensure the most direct , unbiased comparison , the simulated distributions should be calculated not at a fixed 3-d virial mass , but at a fixed projected , effective virial mass , defined as in section  2.3 .",
    "we expect this projected virial mass to also be observationally measured in more clusters .",
    "numerical simulations show a clear correlation between the concentration of a halo and its formation time , i.e. , the time at which a significant portion of the halo mass first assembled ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this agrees with the intuitive notion that a dense halo core must have assembled at high redshift , when the cosmic density was high .",
    "thus , the fact that observed cluster halos are apparently more centrally concentrated than is predicted in @xmath1cdm suggests an additional mechanism that promotes the collapse of cluster cores at an earlier time than expected .",
    "baryons are unlikely to help .",
    "central cd galaxies contribute only a small fraction of the mass within the einstein radius , which for our four clusters is @xmath0 kpc enclosing a projected mass of @xmath140 , or a 3-d mass of @xmath141 .",
    "we can estimate the effect of baryons on the total mass profile using the simple model of adiabatic compression @xcite . within this model , conservation of angular momentum",
    "implies that the quantity @xmath142 ( assuming spherical symmetry ) is fixed . assuming that we start out with a halo with the mean expected theoretical concentration ( figure  [ fig : netomean ] ) , the observed 3-d mass within the einstein radius can be obtained through adiabatic compression if the enclosed baryonic mass within this radius is @xmath143 in the four clusters we considered .",
    "thus , explaining the discrepancy through adiabatic compression requires the baryonic fraction within the einstein radius to be @xmath144 , twice the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "this seems highly unlikely , as the observed x - ray emission yields at these radii gas fractions well below the cosmic value ( e.g. , see figure  12 of @xcite for a1689 ) , and a cd galaxy contains only @xmath145 in baryons ( e.g. , see @xcite for m87 ) .",
    "modifications in the properties of dark matter or the slope of the primordial power spectrum are generally expected to have a smaller effect on clusters than on smaller - scale objects which are predicted in @xmath1cdm to have earlier formation times and higher concentrations . on the other hand ,",
    "since clusters are rare objects in the standard model , primordial non - gaussianity would significantly affect them and allow clusters to form earlier , which may also help explain other observations @xcite .",
    "regardless of the mechanism , early collapse of cluster cores may have observable consequences if it is accompanied by star formation .",
    "finally , we note that the fact that clusters are now being detected with masses @xmath146 is completely consistent with the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : nofz ] shows that large numbers of clusters are expected out to significant redshifts , including @xmath147 halos out to @xmath148 , as well as more massive halos up to @xmath149 at lower redshift .",
    "clearly , while large samples of halos with precise , profile - independent lensing determinations of both @xmath5 and @xmath14 will make our results completely conclusive , the highly - significant discrepancy we have identified already represents a substantial challenge for @xmath1cdm .",
