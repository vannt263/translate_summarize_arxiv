    "low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems consist of a compact object accreting from a low mass companion star .",
    "the orbit of the lmxbs is expected to evolve due to mass transfer and redistribution of the angular momentum arising from the interaction of the binary components .",
    "the orbital evolution of x - ray binaries can be measured by four different ways .",
    "when the compact object is a pulsating neutron star , the pulse arrival time delay over the binary period is used to determine the orbital parameters of the system and multiple measurements of the orbital epoch over a long period are used to determine the orbital evolution @xcite .",
    "orbital evolution in some black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) , has been measured by constructing the radial velocity curve of the companion star from the doppler shifts of the spectral lines @xcite . in the eclipsing binaries ,",
    "connecting the mid eclipse time can give information on the long term evolution of the orbital period and an accurate determination of orbital period derivatives @xcite .",
    "the orbital evolution can also be measured from the stable orbital modulation of light curves @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of x - ray binaries can increase ( for example , x 2127 + 119 : @xcite ; sax j1808.43658 : @xcite ; 4u 182237 : @xcite 4u 1916053 : @xcite ) or decrease ( for example , 4u 1820 - 30 : @xcite ; her x-1 : @xcite , @xcite ; a 0620 - 00 & xte j1118 + 480 : @xcite ; ax j1745.6 - 2901 : @xcite ; nova muscae 1991 @xcite ) smoothly over several years of measurements .",

    "is one of the rare lmxbs , that show x - ray eclipses in their light curves @xcite .",
    "it is a transient x - ray source which was discovered in 1976 @xcite from observations made with the sas-3 x - ray observatory . through several follow - up observations ,",
    "an orbital period of @xmath47.1 hr and an eclipse duration of @xmath415 min were determined @xcite . about 2 years after its discovery , the x - ray intensity declined and the source was not detectable for the subsequent more than 20 years @xcite . during another outburst and a renewed activity in 1999 , burst oscillations with a period of @xmath41.8 ms were reported @xcite , which could be the spin period of the neutron star . after being x - ray bright for about 2.5 years",
    ", the source went into quiescence near the beginning of 2001 .    comparing the orbital period of   measured from two",
    "eclipses during the first outburst and from four eclipses during the early part of the second outburst , @xcite reported an orbital period decay and determined an average decay timescale of 10@xmath3 yr .",
    "but since this source was not detectable for a long time in between the two outbursts , there is no detailed record of the orbital period changes .",
    "later , @xcite determined two more mid - eclipse times of , using the _ beppo_-sax data during the second outburst . these measurements , along with the previous values , however , were not compatible with a simple orbital decay as was suggested earlier by @xcite .",
    "all the available eclipse measurements at this stage ( eight ) , indicated some complexity in the orbital solution of this source .",
    "recently ,   went into another outburst @xcite , thus enabling a definitive study of its orbital evolution . in this work ,",
    "we have determined mid - eclipse times using newer _",
    "rxte_-pca and _ xmm - newton _ observations of this source , made during the second and the current outburst .",
    "the _ rxte_-pca consists of an array of five collimated proportional counter units with a total photon collection area of 6500 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed 24 archived observations of   made with the _ rxte _ observatory .",
    "the observation log is given in table  1 .",
    "the pca data collected in the event mode was used to generate the light curves , using the ftool - seextrct from the astronomy software package heasoft - ver 6.10 .",
    "the analysis was done in the energy band 2@xmath620 kev .",
    "the background was estimated using the ftool - pcabackest .",
    "faint source model was taken from the _ rxte _ website .",
    "thereafter , barycentric corrections were applied to all x - ray timings .",
    "xmm_-newton observatory @xcite carries three x - ray mirrors and three focal plane instruments , each with a field of view of about 30@xmath2 30 .",
    "complete x - ray eclipses of   have been observed during two _",
    "xmm_-newton observations .",
    "we have analyzed both of these archived observations .",
    "the first of these observations was made during the second outburst .",
    "it lasted for @xmath431.5 ks and covered two complete eclipses .",
    "another @xmath442.9 ks long observation during the current outburst covered one complete eclipse .",
    "observation details are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we have analyzed the 0.2 - 10 kev epic - pn data , using the xmm science analysis system ( sas version 8.0.0 ) .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region of radius 40centered on the position of the target .",
    "background events were extracted from a similar source - free circular region .",
    "background subtracted light curves were barycenter corrected using the sas tool barycen .",
    "spectroscopic results from the february 2001 observation have been reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "they have reported the presence of two eclipses .",
    "however , they did not report the mid - eclipse times for the purpose of orbital evolution measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] shows two sample background subtracted light curves of , binned with 3 seconds and including an eclipse lasting for @xmath4900 s. the mid eclipse times were determined by modeling each ingress and egress transition with a @xmath7step and ramp \" model , which has been successfully employed in case of other eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "the variable parameters of the model are , the pre - ingress , eclipse , and post - egress count rates ; the ingress and egress duration , the eclipse duration and the mid - eclipse time .",
    "considering all the components to be freely variable , we first fitted the seven - parameter model to the light curves covering the eclipse and @xmath4150 s before and after the eclipse ( similar to @xcite ) . for _",
    "rxte_-pca , it was found that the value of pre - ingress and the post egress count rates were similar and the eclipse ingress and egress duration were also similar within errors .",
    "the parameter space for _ rxte_-pca , was thus reduced to five .    from all the observations of _ rxte _ and _ xmm_-newton , we have determined 27 mid - eclipse time measurements .",
    "the mid - eclipse times and the corresponding 1@xmath8 statistical errors are given in table  1 .",
    "the durations of ingress and egress have been mentioned separately for the _",
    "xmm_-newton observations .",
    "the orbit numbers are in accordance with the eclipse time measurements given in @xcite .",
    "as compared to other observations , the mid eclipse times determined from the _ rxte _ observations have smaller error , except in two observations where count rate was relatively low .",
    "short timescale intrinsic variability in the intensity of the lmxb can modify the ingress / egress and thus effect the mid - eclipse time measurements .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the additional random error in the mid - eclipse time measurements due to variability in the source , we simulated eclipses ( with similar parameters as given in table  1 ) at several positions in an _",
    "rxte_-pca light curve .",
    "differences of the values of the mid - eclipse time that were used for simulation and those measured from the simulated data , were found to be about 1.3 seconds .",
    "therefore , for further analysis , we have considered this value as an additional random error due to the intrinsic intensity variation of the lmxb , and have quadratically added it to the statistical error of each mid - eclipse time measurement .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath9 the numbers in bracket indicate the 1@xmath8 errors",
    "we have determined 27 new mid - eclipse times of the x - ray binary   using data from _ rxte _ and _ xmm_-newton observatories .",
    "these measurements have been used to determine the orbital evolution in this system .",
    "orbital evolution of lmxbs is complex and is known to display different trends .",
    "the orbital separation is known to increase in most of the lmxbs , at timescales which are shorter than that predicted by a conservative mass transfer or by gravitational wave radiation @xcite .",
    "a decreasing orbital period has been observed in a few lmxbs and some short period bhxbs .",
    "but the orbital decay in these systems is also unusual and is much faster than that predicted by conventional methods of gravitational wave radiation , magnetic braking and mass loss from the system @xcite .",
    "interaction with a third body could be responsible for a large orbital decay observed in two lmxbs @xcite .",
    "orbital period glitches have been observed in a couple of lmxbs , and are attributed to be due to magnetic cycling of the secondary star @xcite . even though most of the lmxbs show a reasonably good quadratic fit to the mid - eclipse time records , there are signatures of deviation from a constant orbital period derivative present on longer timescales @xcite .",
    "the mid - eclipse time history of   seems to be quite unusual .",
    "the combined data spanning three outbursts and covering @xmath440 years of timeline , indicates an orbital decay .",
    "in addition , a large number of measurements in a two year period during the second outburst show sinusoidal variation in the eclipse timing residual , perhaps indicating the presence of a third body around this source .    we can consider the x - ray binary ( the inner binary ) to be a point mass in an approximate binary motion with this third body . in that case",
    ", the sinusoidal residual is due to orbital motion of the inner binary around the center of mass of the whole system .",
    "this is similar to the pulse arrival time delay of a binary x - ray pulsar , except that instead of a periodic pulse , we have a periodic eclipse .    for a 1.4 @xmath10 neutron star",
    ", the mass of the companion star lies between 0.250.9 @xmath10 @xcite . assuming the radius of the orbit of the x - ray binary ( having an estimated total mass in the range 1.652.3 @xmath10 ) around the center of mass of the system to be same as amplitude of the sinusoidal residual , the third body ( assumed to be co - planar with the inner binary ) should have a mass range of 0.01950.0257 @xmath10 ( i.e. , 20.526.9 jupiter mass ) and an estimated range for orbital radius between 750860 lt - sec .",
    "the two extremes of this estimation are graphically shown in figure  [ fig : simulation ] .",
    "taking m@xmath11 and r@xmath11 as the mass and radius of orbit of the binary ; and m@xmath12 and r@xmath12 as the mass and orbital radius of the third object , we have drawn curves for the expressions below for two extremes of the mass of the inner binary , i.e. , 1.65 @xmath10 ( dashed line ) and 2.3 @xmath10 ( solid line ) , respectively .",
    "( here , g is the gravitational constant . )",
    "@xmath13    in figure  [ fig : simulation ] , the square markers indicate these estimated parameters for two extremes of the mass of the inner binary . depending on the mass of the inner binary ,",
    "the true mass and orbital radius of the third body will lie on the dotted line connecting these square markers .",
    "the additional errors in these two parameters due to the uncertainty in period and amplitude of the sinusoidal component have been estimated by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the additional 1@xmath8 uncertainty is represented by two dash - dotted lines parallel to the diagonal ( dotted ) line .",
    "the mass and orbital radius of the third body have been estimated assuming a circular and co - planar orbit .",
    "there is no evidence of circularity except that the residual shown in figure 2 is consistent with being sinusoidal .",
    "co - planarity is a reasonable assumption as the circumbinary planets discovered with kepler are nearly co - planar @xcite    though rarer compared to planets around single stars , about 20 circumbinary planets are known among @xmath41000 eclipsing binaries observed with kepler @xcite . if true , the third body in the present system is the most massive circumbinary planet ; exceeding kepler-1647b by a factor of about 15 @xcite .",
    "simulations of planet formation and migration around binary stars show the most stable planets to be in the sub - saturn mass range while more than jupiter mass planets , if present , are likely to have large orbits around the binary @xcite .",
    "the binary period of mxb 1658 - 298 is also much shorter compared to the orbital period of all the binary stellar systems around which planets have been found , the shortest binary period being 7.4 days in kepler-47 @xcite .",
    "the lack of planets around short period binaries is believed to be related to the process of angular momentum loss that brings the two stars closer in the process of binary evolution @xcite .",
    "the system mxb",
    "1658 - 298 gives important new input for the range of stellar configurations for which circumbinary planets may form and survive migration over several stages of binary evolution .",
    "in particular , the binary system being a low mass x - ray binary and having an age of several billion years is an important input for the study of planet formation and migration around binary stellar systems .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
