    "existence of two independent macroscopic motions is a specific feature of superfluids .",
    "equilibrium state is , thus , characterized by two velocities of these motions . in general the equilibrium thermodynamic state",
    "is unambiguously determined by the values of all additive integrals of motion .",
    "integral of motion that corresponds to one of the velocities ( the `` normal component velocity '' ) , like it is in usual hydrodynamics , is momentum .",
    "appearance of the superfluid velocity as a thermodynamic variable implies the existence of an extra additive integral of motion .",
    "below we explicitly find the integral and this allows us to investigate general thermodynamic stability conditions and , in particular , the problem of critical velocities .    usually in experiments the vortices",
    "destroy superfluidity at feynman critical velocity which is far below the landau critical velocity .",
    "this is why the superfluid hydrodynamics equations can be expanded in powers of low velocities and one safely uses the first nontrivial terms of this expansion .",
    "nevertheless , there is a number of experiments@xcite where this is not enough . in some of them",
    "the superfluid flow is studied in small orifices .",
    "it has been shown that in these circumstances the maximum velocity is inversely proportional to the orifice width and may reach the order of the landau critical velocity if the aperture is small enough .",
    "other experiments are performed at temperatures extremely close to the superfluid transition . in this region",
    ", the linear approximation fails at low velocities starting from those much smaller than the feynman critical velocity ( which does not depend on the temperature ) .",
    "this means that all thermodynamic quantities of the superfluid become nontrivial functions of the not small superfluid velocity ( _ i.e. _ ,  they depend not only on the usual thermodynamic coordinates such as pressure and temperature ) .",
    "the only assumption one can make ( and we do it ) is that the fluid at rest is isotropic .",
    "this quite general statement of the problem is used in the paper ( and in our earlier letter@xcite ) ; in the next section we find the complete set of thermodynamic inequalities in this light , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  the conditions imposed on thermodynamic functions for the superfluid to remain stable .",
    "later we employ the landau phonon - roton model to calculate the highest velocity compatible with obtained thermodynamic inequalities and show that it can be interpreted as a critical velocity .",
    "this thermodynamic scenario supposedly explains the superfluidity breakdown in small orifices . in the vicinity of the @xmath0-point we use scaling speculations to find critical behavior of the critical velocity .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium of an isolated system is a state with maximum entropy at given values of all its additive integrals of motion .",
    "superfluid system is unusual in the sense it has a continuous gauge symmetry spontaneously broken , such system possesses a specific quantum order parameter , `` wave function of the be condensate '' .",
    "this is why in superfluid there are two independent velocities of normal and superfluid motion .",
    "the superfluid velocity is ( up to a factor ) a gradient of the wave function phase @xmath1 .",
    "the same is true for the time derivative @xmath2 .",
    "this is a local conservation law of all three components of the vector @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", @xmath4 is the density of a new additive integral of motion ( along with mass density or momentum density ) .",
    "this integral is specific to superfluid .    instead of the entropy maximality",
    ", it is usually convenient@xcite to use another requirement , equivalent to the first one , namely the energy minimality under constant entropy and additive integrals of motion .",
    "this is the requirement of thermodynamic stability and may be expressed in form of _ thermodynamic inequalities_.    total energy of the superfluid @xmath5 is an integral of the energy density @xmath6 over the entire volume @xmath7 .",
    "the energy density can be obtained via a galilean transformation@xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9  is the superfluid velocity , @xmath10 is the mass density and subscript `` 0 '' denotes quantities measured in the frame of reference of the superfluid component ( that is the frame , where the superfluid velocity is zero ) .",
    "namely , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy density and the momentum density with respect to the superfluid component .",
    "the former is a function of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and the entropy density @xmath13 .",
    "its differential can be written as @xmath14 where lagrange multipliers @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the temperature , the chemical potential , and the so - called relative velocity of normal and superfluid components .",
    "the liquid is isotropic and , consequently , the velocity @xmath17 and the momentum density @xmath12 are parallel to each other : @xmath18 this leads to a useful identity for the partial derivatives of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath17 : @xmath19    further transforming , we can write @xmath20 with the help of in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total momentum density and @xmath23 is the normal velocity .",
    "stability implies that each `` allowed '' fluctuation increases the total energy of the system @xmath5 .",
    "allowed are the fluctuations leaving conserved quantities unchanged .",
    "this means that the minimality of @xmath5 must be investigated under fixed entropy and all additive integrals of motion : mass , momentum , and superfluid velocity .",
    "consider a macroscopic fluctuation of all the variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "they are conserved and this ensures that the first variation of the total energy for a uniform system is identically zero @xmath28 the matrix of the second variation quadratic form is a jacobian matrix @xmath29 @xmath30 it is positive definite if all principal minors in the top - left corner @xmath31 are positive .",
    "we recursively test these minors :    * the first positivity condition @xmath32 corresponds to the usual requirement of the heat capacity positivity .",
    "it is shown below that @xmath33 , hence the last inequality eventually becomes @xmath34 * positivity of the next group of minors is easily verified with the following transformation @xmath35 positivity of the minors @xmath36 is guaranteed if all minors of the second term in are positive @xmath37 here we used and chose the direction of the @xmath17 vector as the first coordinate .",
    "our collection is therefore augmented by two more inequalities @xmath38 @xmath39 * the same transformation applied to the biggest minors yields : @xmath40 again , the minors @xmath41 and @xmath42 are positive if all nontrivial principal minors of @xmath43 are positive .",
    "we use the thermodynamic identity to relate the chemical potential  @xmath16 and the conventional pressure  @xmath44 @xmath45 this gives @xmath46 the following is an explicit representation of @xmath43 sub - matrix corresponding to a four - dimensional sub - space @xmath47 ; as before we let the @xmath48-axis run along @xmath17 direction . using we obtain @xmath49 + appropriate inequalities are : @xmath50 which is literally a generalized ( to a non - zero inter - component velocity @xmath51 ) positive compressibility requirement , @xmath52 @xmath53    inequalities , , , , , and are sufficient conditions for the thermodynamic stability .",
    "in a `` stopped - normal - component '' arrangement , the mass flux @xmath54 with respect to the normal component may become more convenient than @xmath12the mass flux relative to the superfluid one .",
    "the obvious relation between them @xmath55 leads to the following reformulation of the inequalities :    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    as a simple application of the derived inequalities , consider them at @xmath60 . from , , , and we get @xmath61 @xmath62 using conventional notation , last inequality reads @xmath63",
    "here , we provide a practical example of the stability criteria for real superfluid @xmath64 . to calculate derivatives involved in the inequalities one must use the microscopic approach .",
    "simple and clear landau phonon - roton model works pretty well over wide temperature and velocity ranges .",
    "we use this model to calculate the contribution of these quasiparticles to the `` modified '' free energy in the frame of reference of the superfluid component : @xmath65 this potential is obtained from the excitation spectrum with the conventional formula @xmath66 we denoted the excitation energy @xmath67 , which is given for two branches by the expressions @xmath68 subscripts distinguish the quantities related to phonons and rotons , @xmath69 is the sound velocity , @xmath70 is the roton energy gap , @xmath71 is the effective mass , and @xmath72 is the momentum at the roton minimum ( we take numerical data from refs .",

    "a small dimensionless parameter @xmath81 ensures , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  that the landau critical velocity is determined by @xmath82 .    when integrated , these dispersion laws give the following contribution to the free energy : @xmath83 one can obtain all thermodynamic variables by differentiating this potential .",
    "namely @xmath84 we neglect the quasiparticle contribution to the pressure derivative .    versus temperature @xmath15 .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the equation @xmath85 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath86 holds true over entire stability domain .",
    "the `` stability '' critical velocity @xmath87  coincides with the landau critical velocity @xmath88  at zero temperature and vanishes completely ( see ) at the critical temperature @xmath89 .",
    "the curve is superimposed on the experimental graph of the critical phase difference over a @xmath90 aperture in a thin foil at various frequencies.@xcite ]    at zero velocity the inequalities in eq .",
    "fail at the @xmath0-point . when the velocity is higher , the inequality is the first to become invalid . at zero temperature ,",
    "the critical ( the highest possible without stability violation ) velocity tends to the landau critical velocity @xmath88 , _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath91 . ] .",

    "the liquid is unstable above the curves .    in fig .",
    "[ wcrit ] the critical velocity is plotted with the solid line . scaled experimental data@xcite are presented in the same graph .",
    "high frequency points follow the shape of the theoretical curve , but at low frequencies sufficient discrepancy is observed .",
    "this might be explained by the long time required for vortex nucleation . at higher frequencies",
    "the thermodynamic stability limit is observed while lower frequency critical velocity is cut off by vortices .",
    "whatever feasible explanation this might be , the following warning must be taken into account when experimental data on critical phase difference and our predictions are compared .",
    "assumption that the critical velocity is determined by the stability limit implies that the hydrodynamic equations inside orifice are essentially nonlinear .",
    "particularly , one can not consider the superfluid component as an incompressible fraction of the liquid .",
    "in other words the phase shift across the length of the orifice is _ not _ proportional to the maximum velocity attained in the orifice .    in fig .",
    "[ qcrit ] the critical energy flux is plotted . in typical arrangement",
    "the energy is carried by the superfluid counterflow , where normal and superfluid velocities are directed oppositely to each other to keep zero net mass flux . in zero",
    "mass flux frame the condition @xmath92 yields @xmath93 for the energy flux .     versus temperature @xmath15 . ]",
    "to find the behavior of the critical velocity near the @xmath0-point , scaling arguments should be used .",
    "we assume that the low velocity expansion of the irregular part of thermodynamic potential near @xmath89 starts with @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are constants , @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the critical index of the specific heat @xmath99 , the `` superfluid density '' @xmath100 follows josephson scaling relation@xcite @xmath101 , and the index @xmath48 will be determined below .",
    "according to the hypothesis of scale invariance , all terms in are of the same order in the fluctuation region .",
    "this yields @xmath102 and @xmath103 . on the other hand ,",
    "the stability is destroyed by the velocity at which the linear approximation fails , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   @xmath104 current value for the specific heat index@xcite @xmath105 gives 0.671 exponent for the critical velocity    extensive data near the @xmath0-point are available in the critical energy flux experiments.@xcite in the vicinity of the transition , eq .",
    "is reduced to @xmath106 and the critical flux is determined by @xmath107 which is in moderate agreement with experimental value of the exponent @xmath108 .",
    "experimentally , the superfluidity breakdown is believed to have the following nature.@xcite until the aperture size is too small , the critical velocity does not depend on the temperature and increases as the size decreases .",
    "this is the very behavior that is specific to the feynman vortex - related critical velocity .    when the orifice width is narrow enough , or the temperature is close enough to @xmath89 the breakdown scenario and its features change .",
    "the critical velocity does not depend on the aperture any more but decreases when the temperature increases .",
    "this behavior is commonly associated@xcite with the iordanski - langer - fisher mechanism.@xcite nevertheless , this association lacks numerical comparison because no reliable information about the actual orifice shape is available .    on",
    "the other hand experimentally observed behavior of the critical velocity can be attributed to the suggested stability criterion .",
    "in other words , we provide an alternative explanation of experimental results based on an assumption that in narrow orifices the thermodynamic limit of @xmath87  is reached .",
    "we should also note that our approach to the critical velocity as a stability limit is similar to that used by kramer.@xcite actually , the inequality he employed is not a thermodynamic one , but numerical results for the critical velocity he obtained using the phonon - roton model do not deviate much from those plotted in fig .",
