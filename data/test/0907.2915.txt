    "the cern large hadron collider is about to start probing directly the tev scale with the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism being at center stage . in order to respect unitarity in the weak gauge boson scattering @xmath5",
    "there must be a contribution of the ewsb at the tev scale  @xcite , well within the lhc reach . in the sm the growth of the scattering amplitude of this process is cutoff by the presence of the higgs boson , however , the simplest one doublet higgs sector is just one of a myriad of possibilities for the symmetry breaking sector of the electroweak interactions .",
    "one appealing possibility is that the electroweak symmetry breaking is caused by a new strongly interacting sector  @xcite .",
    "although simple scaled up qcd models are ruled out by precision measurements and flavor changing neutral current constraints , it is possible to build viable models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . a common feature of many of these models is the appearance of new spin1 states that unitarize the weak gauge boson scattering .",
    "recently scenarios presenting extra dimensions have received a lot of attention , allowing the construction of higgsless models where unitarity restoration takes place through the exchange of an infinite tower of spin1 kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the known electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite . in this class of models",
    "@xcite unitarity constraints give rise to sum rules depending on the couplings and masses of the kk excitations that imply that the first kk excitation should be observable at the lhc , while higher kk modes are probably beyond the lhc reach  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of many ewsb scenarios , as the ones above mentioned , is the existence of new vector resonances , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that couple to @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs , respectively .",
    "but , generically , their properties , such as mass , width , and couplings to sm fermions , are model dependent . in this respect",
    ", the most _ model independent _ channel for detection of such spin-1 resonances would be the observation of their contribution to sm gauge boson fusion ( wbf ) which only involves their couplings to electroweak gauge bosons . at the lhc",
    "this would correspond to the @xmath6 exchange contribution to @xmath10 , such as for example in the process @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , that signal is unobservable at lhc even with increased luminosity @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath7 can be observed in the wbf @xmath12 elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "the new spin-1 states can also be directly produced in @xmath13 collisions via their couplings to light quarks . in this case , in order to determine that such new vector bosons are indeed associated with ewsb one can study processes in which the new spin-1 decays into electroweak gauge boson pairs , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for electrons and muons and @xmath17 for jets .    in this work",
    "we present a _ model independent _ analysis of the observability of these signals .",
    "we express our results as function of the relevant spin-1 boson effective couplings , mass and width . for @xmath6 states",
    "these are the most sensitive channels which can give information on its connection to ewsb .",
    "for @xmath7 they complement its observation in wbf and provide further information on the @xmath7 properties .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] we present the framework of our analysis and the underlying assumptions in our model independent approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal ] we describe the differentiating characteristics between the signal and sm backgrounds contributing to the processes ( [ ppww ] ) and ( [ ppwz ] ) and quantify those after imposing the corresponding cuts to optimize the signal to background ratio . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we present and discuss the obtainable sensitivities in the different channels as a function of the relevant parameters .",
    "from the phenomenological point of view , the study of processes ( [ ppww ] ) and ( [ ppwz ] ) requires the knowledge of the couplings of the new spin1 states to the light quarks and to electroweak vector boson pairs , in addition to their masses and widths .    in this work , for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we assume that the couplings of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 to the light quarks and to gauge bosons have the same lorentz structure as those of the sm , as it is the case for higgsless models , but with rescaled strength . in higgsless models ,",
    "the unitarity bound in @xmath18 is saturated by the exchange of the first kaluza - klein excitation ( or @xmath6 ) if its couplings to electroweak gauge bosons is given by  @xcite @xmath19 for a given @xmath6 mass .",
    "correspondingly , the saturation of unitarity in the elastic scattering @xmath12 leads to the constraint  @xcite @xmath20 these constraints imply an upper bound on the decay width of the kk - bosons into sm gauge bosons .",
    "in what follows we use @xmath21 and @xmath22 simply as convenient normalizations for the coupling of the spin-1 resonance to sm gauge bosons .",
    "moreover , in a generic model , the new spin1 states have further couplings to other particles , _ e.g. _ @xmath23 or @xmath24 quarks , that contribute to their width .",
    "therefore , in this work we treat the @xmath6 and @xmath7 widths as free parameters . with these assumptions it is possible to make a model independent analysis of the observability of the relevant processes .    within this framework",
    "the cross section for the processes ( [ ppww ] ) and ( [ ppwz ] ) can be written in full generality as @xmath25 where for processes ( [ ppww ] ) @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . for processes ( [ ppwz ] )",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the @xmath33 coupling constant and @xmath34 the cosine of the weak mixing angle .",
    "we notice that the final state @xmath35 can receive contributions from both @xmath6 and @xmath7 intermediate states .",
    "when studying this channel we consider the sensitivity to each of the contributions separately .    in this approach , for each final state the analysis depends on three parameters : the mass of the new spin-1 gauge boson , @xmath36 , its width , @xmath37 , and the product of its couplings to light quarks and to sm gauge bosons , @xmath38 .",
    "these parameters are only subject to the constraint that for a given value of product of the couplings of the new spin-1 boson and of its mass , there is lower bound on its width , since @xmath39 using the values the partial widths ( all in gev ) : @xmath40 it is possible to show that the minimum @xmath41 decay widths ( in gev ) are : @xmath42    we perform our parton ",
    "level analyses using the stand alone package of madgraph  @xcite supplemented by the new states and interactions .",
    "we simulate experimental resolutions by smearing the energies , but not directions , of all final state leptons with a gaussian error given by a resolution @xmath43 while for jets we assumed a resolution @xmath44 , if @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , if @xmath47 ( @xmath48 in gev ) .",
    "furthermore the lepton detection efficiency was taken to be @xmath49 . in our calculations we use cteq6l parton distribution functions",
    "@xcite with renormalization and factorization scales @xmath50 for pure leptonic final states , while for the channels containing jets we employ @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we describe the main features of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 signals for the different final states , presenting the main sm backgrounds and discuss possible cuts to enhance the signal to backgrounds ratios .",
    "we start discussing the observability of the @xmath6 signal in the leptonic @xmath53 decay channels with both equal and different flavor leptons in the final state . in the case of different flavor leptons ,",
    "the @xmath6 signal in process ( [ ppww ] ) possesses sm backgrounds coming from the production of @xmath54 pairs , as well as , from @xmath55 pairs where the top quarks decay semi - leptonically .",
    "the starting cuts are meant to ensure the detection and isolation of the final partons plus a minimum transverse momentum since @xmath6 has a mass in excess of a few hundred gev  @xcite and it is expected to lead to hard leptons @xmath56    the presence of two neutrinos in the final state renders impossible the complete reconstruction of the event .",
    "nevertheless the signal can still be partially characterized with the use of the transverse invariant mass variable @xmath57^{1/2 }   \\label{eq : mtww}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the missing transverse momentum vector , @xmath59 is the transverse momentum of the pair @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the @xmath62 invariant mass .",
    "final state for different values of @xmath63 .",
    "the widths are chosen to be the minimum values compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq : zwidmin ] ) , @xmath64 gev for 0.5 and 1 tev , respectively",
    ". the hatched area stands for the sm background contribution.,width=336 ]    we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtdist ] the characteristic invariant mass distribution expected for several values of @xmath63 .",
    "the sm prediction is represented by the solid light grey ( yellow ) histogram while the darker areas represent the @xmath6 expected signal for @xmath65 and 1 tev as indicated . as seen in this figure , the characteristic peak associated with the production of a resonance",
    "is substantially broadened due to the incomplete event reconstruction , however , the @xmath6 production is still signaled by an excess of events in the region @xmath66    a sizable contribution contribution to the background arises from the sm @xmath55 production which leads to a @xmath54 pair on the final state accompanied by two b  jets .",
    "this background can be efficiently reduced by vetoing the presence of additional jets with @xmath67 the probability of a qcd ( electroweak ) event to survive such a central jet veto has been analyzed for various processes in ref .",
    "moreover , at the high  luminosity run of the lhc there will be more than one interaction per bunch crossing , consequently there is a probability of detecting an extra jet in the gap region due to pile  up . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that survival probability due to pile ",
    "up is 0.75 for a threshold cut of @xmath68 gev .",
    "taking into account these two effects we included in our analysis veto survival probabilities @xmath69    further reduction of @xmath55 background can be achieved by use of the difference of the azimuthal angular distributions of the final leptons .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : delphill ] where we show the azimuthal angular separation of the charged leptons for both signal and @xmath55 background .",
    "consequently , one can also require @xmath70     final state .",
    "the solid histogram stands for the signal distribution for @xmath71 tev with @xmath72=0.1 , while the dashed one represents the sm @xmath55 background.,width=336 ]    in the case that the final state leptons in reaction ( [ ppww ] ) have the same flavor ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) , there are additional backgrounds originating from drell - yan lepton pair production , as well as @xmath75 pair production . in this case , the cuts ( [ cutsww1 ] ) , ( [ eq : mtcut ] ) , ( [ eq : veto ] ) and ( [ eq : phillc ] ) are supplemented by @xmath76 in order to suppress the drell - yan pair production . furthermore @xmath77 is required to reduce the @xmath75 background .",
    "table [ tab : ww ] contains the cross sections for the different contributions to the sm backgrounds after all the cuts described above , as well as for the signal , normalized as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmatot ] ) , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 tev and for an illustrative value of the width @xmath80 . once the cuts are imposed , the interference term @xmath81 is negligibly small for all values of @xmath6 masses and widths considered .",
    ".signal and background cross sections in fb for the @xmath82 final state for all possible lepton combinations with either electrons or muons . for the final state with different flavor leptons",
    "the cuts ( [ cutsww1 ] ) to ( [ eq : phillc ] ) are applied while for same flavor leptons the cuts ( [ cutsww1 ] ) to ( [ mllcut ] ) are imposed .",

    "in the present study , we use as signal of the production of a new resonance @xmath41 ( @xmath93 or @xmath7 ) the excess in the total number of events over the sm expectations after the application of the suitable cuts described in the previous section .",
    "the analysis of the statistical significance of the signals described is simplified by the fact that in all channels the interference between the sm and the @xmath94 contributions , @xmath95 , is negligible for @xmath96 after cuts .",
    "in particular , for sufficiently high number of expected background events , the @xmath97 sensitivity bounds on the @xmath41 properties can be obtained assuming gaussian statistics as @xmath98 here we present our results for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath99 . for this luminosity",
    "the number of background events is large enough to gaussian statistics to hold for all cases with the exception of the leptonic heavy @xmath7 channel , @xmath100 . in this case condition ( [ eq : lim ] ) is modified by adopting the corresponding 5@xmath86 observability bound for poisson statistics in the presence of the corresponding expected background .",
    "we depict in figs .",
    "[ fig : boundsv0lep][fig : boundswplljj ] the ranges of couplings @xmath101 for which a 5@xmath86 signal can be observed as a function of the resonance width for three different values of its mass @xmath102 tev in the different channels .",
    "there are some basic features that are common to all the cases .",
    "first of all , the observability regions are bounded both from below and above .",
    "the lower bound arises from the condition of the signal being observable while the upper limit originates from the consistency of our effective description of the vector resonance production . for a given vector mass",
    "the contribution of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 partial widths should not surpass the assumed value of the total width ; this fact is described by the upper limits given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zcouplimit ] ) and ( [ eq : wcouplimit ] ) .",
    "another general feature is that the lower bound on the @xmath105 increases as the total width @xmath37 is augmented just because broad resonances tend to produce more events outside the @xmath41 invariant mass window used to define the signal ; see for instance ( [ wzjjl : c4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as can be expected , the lower limit on the coupling constant product increases for heavier @xmath41 masses . here , we have two effects collaborating : not only the the production cross section decreases for heavier vector masses , but also its decay products are more collimated becoming harder to pass the isolation cuts imposed on jets and leptons .",
    "it is interesting to compare the expected sensitivity for the @xmath6 in the purely leptonic @xmath106 final state , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundsv0lep ] , with the semileptonic final state , @xmath107 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundsv0nljj ] . from these figures , we see that the possibility of reconstructing the @xmath6 peak and the larger event rates leads to better sensitivity for the semileptonic channel for @xmath71 and @xmath108 tev despite the larger qcd backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of the channels is reversed for heavier @xmath63 because the @xmath84 s are very energetic and their decay jets are highly collimated not passing the isolation cut in ( [ jjlnu : c1 ] ) .    as for the expected sensitivity to the @xmath7 ,",
    "the best channel for all masses considered is the purely leptonic final state @xmath109 as consequence of the achievable background reduction . also , as foreseeable , the predicted sensitivity to @xmath7 in the @xmath107 final state is comparable to the corresponding one for @xmath6 in the same final state ( up to the difference strength in the couplings to light quarks of the @xmath84 and @xmath83 ) and only slightly better than the observability of @xmath7 in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "the purely leptonic and semi - leptonic channels are complementary since they allow us to determine which resonance ( @xmath7 or @xmath6 ) has been produced if a signal is indeed observed .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath6 productions lead to the same final state @xmath107 , however , additional signals in the @xmath1 and @xmath110 channels characterize the @xmath7 existence , while the smoking gun for the @xmath6 is an additional signal in the @xmath111 channel .",
    "we also notice that should the narrow width approximation hold for @xmath112 one would have @xmath113 where @xmath114 depends only on @xmath36 .",
    "thus , in the region of validity of the narrow width approximation , the bounds on @xmath41 obey a simple scaling law characterized by @xmath115 being a constant depending on @xmath36 and the final state considered . as we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig : boundsv0lep ] to [ fig : boundswplljj ] our results are reasonably well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundwidth2 ] ) for @xmath116  @xmath117 , while there is a departure from this simple scaling rule for larger widths .    as a final comment ,",
    "let s notice that these results should be taken with a pitch of salt since there might exist additional backgrounds to the vector resonance searches coming from the new physics associated to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "for instance , in extra dimension models there is a plethora of new heavy states that might give rise to final states similar to the ones we studied , _ e.g. _ kk charged leptons can decay into a @xmath84 pair accompanied by neutrinos . if these backgrounds turned out to be sizeable , certainly the reconstruction of the new resonance breit",
    " wigner profile would become an important tool to isolate the new vector states .",
    "moreover , we have not considered the systematic uncertainties associated to the prediction of the absolute value of the sm backgrounds that can be of the order of 520%  @xcite .    in summary , in this work",
    "we have performed a model independent analyses of the observability of a new spin1 particle , either neutral or charged , that is associated to the unitarity restoration in the electroweak vector boson scattering .",
    "in addition to the essential couplings to electroweak gauge boson pairs we also considered the new vector resonance couplings to light quarks ; many extensions of the sm , like higgsless models , contain such couplings .",
    "we analyzed the five channels shown in eqs .",
    "( [ ppww ] ) and ( [ ppwz ] ) expressing the attainable bounds as a function of the resonance effective couplings , its mass and width .",
    "our analyses show that the study of these process have a large reach at the lhc , allowing to discover or exclude many scenarios like higgsless models .",
