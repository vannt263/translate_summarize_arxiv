    "chemical reaction is one of the most remarkable quantum mechanical phenomena that made biological life possible on earth , which can also be manipulated to discover novel `` green '' chemistry , and to avoid `` toxic '' technologies , provided we can understand the reaction microscopically to a certain extent .",
    "however , within the current formalism of chemical kinetics and the laws of thermodynamics , a chemical reaction between two reactant atoms ( for a given chemical potential , temperature , pressure and concentration ) occurs when they collide with each other with enough energy to overcome an arrhenius - type activation energy , to form a(several ) new bond(s )  @xcite . here",
    ", we attempt to go beyond this macroscopic collision - thermodynamic based description by incorporating some microscopic physics ( with respect to atomic energy level spacings ) to understand why and how a chemical reaction proceeds for a given set of conditions .",
    "the chemical reaction considered here may need the right reaction coordinates to form the transition states . therefore , for two atoms ( either isolated or from two different molecules ) to chemically react , they need to have the correct reaction coordinates , and even after fulfilling this condition , these atoms still need to have an overall strong attractive interaction ( either before or after the collision ) to form the required transition states .",
    "for example , the transition state is by definition gives equal probability for the reaction to go either way ( to form reactant atoms , or the reaction product ) .",
    "therefore , there should be a microscopic mechanism that is responsible for an effective attraction between reactant atoms such that the reaction product is more likely than the formation of reactant atoms , even after forming the transition state .",
    "the standard attractive vdw interaction is a long - range type , and it is too weak ( because it is proportional to 1/@xmath0 ) to initiate any chemical reaction . on the other end , we have the electron(from atom 1)-ion(from atom 2 ) coulomb attraction , which is the strongest , but can not lead to an attraction due to electron(from atom 1)-electron(from atom 2 ) coulomb repulsion . apparently , collisions among the reactant atoms can overcome this electron - electron coulomb repulsion if the atoms are weakly interacting .",
    "collisions can induce electronic excitation and/or polarization , which then can activate ( i ) the electron - electron coulomb repulsion or ( ii ) the attraction due to ion - ion vdw and electron - ion coulomb interactions . as a consequence , we need to find the microscopic physical origin of a chemical reaction with respect to the above strong attractions , which goes beyond the present - day thermodynamics ( chemical potential ) and energetic - collision knowledge .    here",
    ", we prove the existence of a stronger attraction ( stronger than the usual vdw type ) that can be used to understand why and how a chemical reaction can proceed ( with further assistance from collisions ) by overcoming the electron - electron coulomb repulsion .",
    "in other words , we set out to prove the existence of a stronger vdw interaction , which is also shown to be further enhanced by the electron - ion coulomb attraction to activate the chemical reaction .",
    "in particular , we expose that these stronger attractions are polarization - induced effect , which can be precisely associated to atomic energy - level spacings , and these stronger attractions are also responsible to overcoming the said repulsion ( or the activation energy ) .",
    "once the repulsion is overcome , either after , or before the collision , then it is straightforward to understand why and how a chemical reaction between two reactant atoms can proceed .",
    "we stress here that we do need atom - atom collisions for strongly interacting atoms ( with isotropic polarization ) , and also for weakly polarized atoms .",
    "however , after the collision , the above attractions still need to be activated for a chemical reaction to proceed .",
    "it is to be noted here that this stronger vdw attraction has also been partly predicted computationally and indirectly  @xcite by means of the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond  @xcite , the arunan composite hydrogen - vdw bond  @xcite and the non - covalent carbon bond  @xcite . in the section ,",
    "additional notes prior to conclusions , we will show that ramachandran , sasisekharan and ramakrishnan  @xcite have already discovered the notion of stronger non - covalent bonds ( stronger than the vdw bond ) between atoms .",
    "this means that the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond , the hydrogen - vdw composite bond and the non - covalent carbon bond are special cases of the ramachandran bond , in the absence of wavefunction overlapping or chemical reaction .",
    "hence , the ramachandran bond is a non - chemical bond that does not require chemical reaction .",
    "however , to pin down the origin of a stronger vdw and an attractive electron - ion coulomb interactions that overcome the electron - electron repulsion ( due to polarization ) , we definitely need analytic solutions and some abstract analyses .",
    "therefore , we exploit the crude quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) drude model within the ionization energy theory ( iet )  @xcite using the energy - level spacing renormalization group method  @xcite to arrive at accurate and exact results .",
    "the `` quasi '' here implies that one can realign the vectors in a one - dimensional system to account for the two and three dimensional cases in which the atoms are treated as real atoms . in our further analyses ( i and ii ) ,",
    "we unequivocally show why and how the stronger vdw interaction is also consistent with respect to the second - order perturbation theory and the @xmath1 multipole expansion .",
    "therefore , its existence is not due to some interpretational issues arising exclusively from the crude drude model hamiltonian .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian for the one - dimensional two - atom system ( strictly neutral atoms , but with polarizable valence electrons ) plotted schematically in fig .",

    "it is easy to verify that if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then there is an additional induced polarization affecting @xmath14 .",

    "for example , atoms or molecules will be isotropically polarized in the gas - phase , if these atoms or molecules are weakly interacting in the presence of high temperature or intense laser .",

    "the vdw theory with asymmetric polarization developed here is valid for strongly interacting systems , and for @xmath170 .    in summary , a new van der waals ( vdw ) interaction of a stronger type",
    "is proven to exist analytically by generalizing the original vdw interaction .",
    "this generalization includes three types of polarizations between two atoms , namely , isotropic , anisotropic and asymmetric polarizations .",
    "we show that an isotropic polarization is only valid for @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) , which is a well known result within the original vdw theory .",
    "but the other two polarizations ( anisotropic and asymmetric ) are shown to be valid for all @xmath33 .",
    "recall here that @xmath33 is the internuclear distance between two atoms , while @xmath176 is the atomic radius for two identical atoms . using the above generalization",
    ", we went on to explain why and how the original vdw attraction does not lead to an attractive interaction between two highly polarizable atoms due to large coulomb repulsion between polarized electrons .",
    "this explains why @xmath88 is a necessary condition for systems with isotropic polarizations , in accordance with the original vdw formalism .",
    "however , for @xmath177 , the two atomic system should be considered as strongly interacting , giving rise to an anisotropic or an asymmetric polarization . in these cases , there is no requirement on @xmath33 such that these polarizations are valid for any @xmath33 .",
    "here , we briefly reiterate the consequences of our main result , which are important for an overall understanding and also to avoid confusion within quantum chemistry . if one employs a full electronic hamiltonian ( within the quantum chemical methods ) for different interaction strengths , then it is indeed possible to calculate the reaction barriers , and the reaction rates accurately by means of the variational principle and approximate wavefunctions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the theory presented here has been used to predict ( exactly ) which atoms ( from two molecules ) can react to form a peptide bond , in accordance with the experimental observations using the principle of maximum interaction  @xcite . here , we did not attempt to calculate the activation energies because our methodology , by definition , does not allow such calculations to be carried out because our theory does not have variationally adjustable parameters and does not rely on wavefunctions directly .",
    "therefore , our motivation here is to discover the precise microscopic physical origin responsible for a chemical reaction between two atoms , which is still unclear within the quantum chemical calculations due to the introduction of variationally adjustable interaction terms and wavefunctions .    here",
    ", we have derived the relevant interactions ( coulomb and van der waals types ) that control a particular chemical reaction where such interactions can not be obtained by renormalizing or adjusting the coefficient , @xmath140 ( discussed earlier ) , which is also in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite . for example",
    ", we obtained the stronger vdw interaction by summing all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6a ] ) ( with or without renormalization ) , and by adding the electron(from atom 1)-ion(from atom 2 ) coulomb attraction .",
    "in fact , @xmath178 is a natural consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) for @xmath4 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:11x ] ) ) , which then leads to the standard vdw term ( if we only take the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6a ] ) ) . in this work ,",
    "the stronger interaction ( see eq .  ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) ) is shown to go beyond adjusting or renormalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq:6a ] ) , which has been used to understand precisely how two reactant atoms can overcome the activation energy via collisions ( for weakly interacting atoms ) , or without it ( for strongly interacting atoms with induced anisotropic polarization ) .",
    "in fact , we also have justified that the electron(from atom 1)-electron(from atom 2 ) coulomb repulsion is at least , one of the main sources that defines the origin of activation energy .",
    "we now realized that the discovery of stronger attraction between non - chemically bonded ( or simply nonbonded ) atoms has been reported much earlier by ramachandran , sasisekharan and ramakrishnan  @xcite where nonbonded atoms in amino acids ( c , n , o and h ) can approach much closer than what is allowed by the standard vdw bond .",
    "ramachandran correctly and properly reasoned that  @xcite the above nonbonded atoms in amino acids and peptides can approach closer ( with shorter distance between nonbonded atoms ) leading to the formation of triplehelical structure in collagen .",
    "he further proved that such a stronger attraction due to allowed bond rotation , did play an important role in polypeptide chain s conformations , limited only by the steric - hindrance , which led him , sasisekharan and ramakrishnan to invent the ramachandran plot . in view of this fact",
    ", we now set the record straight by stating that eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.3 ] ) also rediscovers the ramachandran bond ( in the absence of chemical reaction ) such that the standard vdw , hydrogen , non - covalent carbon and other similar bonds are special cases .",
    "using the ionization energy theory and the energy - level spacing renormalization group method , we obtained the relevant analytic functions to formally expose the limitation in the original vdw formalism .",
    "in particular , the coulomb repulsion between polarized electrons has been neglected by requiring small polarization , which has been implicitly embedded into the original formalism by requiring the interaction potential constant ( @xmath7 ) to be much greater than the coulomb interaction between atoms ( molecules ) . or , by imposing a large isotropic polarization by invoking spherical harmonics . after taking the large anisotropic polarization effect into account",
    ", we managed to obtain a new vdw formula of a stronger type , which is proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "however , the new formalism also leads to a formula that is proportional to @xmath179 $ ] where @xmath42 is the energy level spacing of a given molecule or system . here",
    ", large @xmath42 means large @xmath7 , in accordance with the original vdw theory .",
    "therefore , large anisotropic polarization does not favor large attractive interaction at all , because of the @xmath39-@xmath39 coulomb repulsion effect ( due to polarized electrons ) .    to overcome this intrinsic problem ,",
    "large asymmetric polarization between two interacting molecules was invoked to expose the existence of a stronger vdw interaction , in which , the above repulsion has been physically converted into a coulomb attraction _ via _ an asymmetric polarization .",
    "for example , the attraction between the polarized electrons ( of an easily anisotropically polarizable atom ) and a nearest neighbor nucleus ( of the least polarizable atom ) gives rise to this asymmetric polarization .",
    "this means that , the large vdw interaction ( due to @xmath123 ) can be justified with the large asymmetric polarization effect .",
    "therefore , there exists a stronger attractive vdw interaction between two strongly interacting atoms if they are polarized asymmetrically such that one of the atom or molecule is anisotropically polarized due to interaction with its nearest least - polarizable neighbor .",
    "the overall strong attractions that come from the stronger ion - ion vdw and electron - ion coulomb interactions determine the possibility of a chemical reaction between two or more neutral atoms , for a given set of conditions ( chemical potential , temperature , pressure and concentration ) .",
    "in particular , we have established that ( i ) a chemical reaction proceeds as a result of some stronger attractions between reactant atoms , ( ii ) the attractions are due to stronger vdw and electron - ion coulomb interactions , ( iii ) systems that contains a mixture of least and easily polarizable reactant atoms induce asymmetric polarization , which then leads to the stronger attractions , and ( iv ) these stronger attractions are the ones that eventually overcome the so - called activation energy .",
    "however , it turns out to be that this stronger attraction has been discovered and proven to exist much earlier by ramachandran , sasisekharan and ramakrishnan .",
    "rightly so , the bond caused by this generalized stronger attraction ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.3 ] ) ) is ( and should be ) called the ramachandran bond .",
    "we have shown here that this stronger attraction can then lead to chemical reaction , if the conditions stated above are met  @xcite .",
