    "during the past ten years , the evolution of structural relaxation in glass - forming liquids has been intensively studied using neutron - scattering spectroscopy , various light - scattering techniques , dielectric - loss spectroscopy , and molecular - dynamics simulation .",
    "results of this work have also been used to test the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , which interpretes the structural relaxation as precursor of the glass - transition .",
    "originally , the mct was proposed as an approximation approach for the cage effect in liquids @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "the mct equations of motion describe an ideal liquid - to - glass transition , i.e. a bifurcation from ergodic to nonergodic dynamics , if control parameters like temperature @xmath3 or packing fraction @xmath4 cross critical values @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this bifurcation is connected with the evolution of a two - step relaxation scenario entirely determined by the regularly changing equilibrium structure .",
    "two divergent time scales appear , closely connected to two power - law decay processes .",
    "a detailed description of these results can be found in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "comparisons of the theoretical results for simple model systems with experiments done on colloids @xcite , and with computer - simulation studies @xcite demonstrate the validity of the microscopic mct approach .",
    "for the solutions of the mct equations , a variety of results has been derived by asymptotic expansions , using as a small parameter the distance from the critical point , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the leading - order results of this expansion establish universality features of the mct dynamics .",
    "assessments of the theory have been reached by comparing spectra in the ghz regime or relaxation curves within the pico - second window with the universal results .",
    "the outcome of this work , which is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , leads to the conclusion that mct properly describes some essential features of structural relaxation even for some complicated molecular liquids .",
    "the mct for simple systems has been extended recently to liquids of nonspherical molecules @xcite .",
    "but so far , only the bifurcation equation for the so - called nonergodicity parameters resulting within the new theory could be solved . comparing these results with the findings of molecular - dynamics simulations for a liquid of linear molecules @xcite and for water",
    "@xcite indicates that the mct for molecular liquids is promising .",
    "it was also predicted that there can be two states of nonergodic motion for nonspherical molecules .",
    "these states are connected by a type - a transition if the molecules exhibit a top - down symmetry @xcite . such transitions are generic possibilities in mct , provided there is some symmetry in the problem rendering certain mode - coupling coefficients zero @xcite . at a type - a transition ,",
    "the nonergodicity parameters change continuously , whereas at the conventional mct transition , referred to in this context as a type - b transition , a discontinuity occurs @xcite .    in this paper , correlation functions and susceptibility spectra",
    "shall be discussed , which deal with the glassy dynamics of the orientational degrees of freedom of nonspherical molecules .",
    "the results are obtained as solutions of the equations of motion derived previously @xcite for the dynamics of a linear probe molecule immersed in a simple liquid .",
    "a top - down symmetric dumbbell of two fused hard spheres will be considered as the molecule , and as the solute , a hard - sphere system is chosen .",
    "this model deals with the simplest problem concerning glassy rotational dynamics , namely the influence of the cages formed by the neighbors of the molecule on the molecule s reorientational motion as it is caused by steric hindrance .",
    "the dynamics will be exemplified for two cases : a molecule with a large elongation and a molecule with a small elongation .",
    "it will be shown that large elongations lead to strong coupling of the rotational degrees of freedom to the density fluctuations of the solute , such that the glassy dynamics of the latter enforces the validity of all the universal mct laws for the solvent . moreover ,",
    "the corrections to the leading - order - asymptotic laws show the same qualitative trends as studied for simple liquids @xcite .",
    "a motivation of the present study is the explanation of three general properties of the @xmath0-relaxation in molecular liquids , which are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ ersteabb ] . in this figure ,",
    "experimental susceptibility spectra for the van - der - waals liquid propylene carbonate ( pc ) are reproduced for four temperatures .",
    "one set of data deals with the response for angular - momentum index @xmath1=1 ; it was obtained by dielectric - loss spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the other set was measured by depolarized - light - scattering spectroscopy @xcite and deals with the ( @xmath1=2 ) reorientational dynamics .",
    "the data show for @xmath9k and @xmath10k @xmath0-relaxation peaks at @xmath11ghz ( @xmath1=1 ) and @xmath12ghz ( @xmath1=2 ) respectively .",
    "these temperatures exceed the melting temperature @xmath13k of pc by more than @xmath14k .",
    "lowering @xmath3 to @xmath15k , the @xmath0-peaks of the spectra are shifted down by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the shape of the @xmath0-peak is temperature independent , and the ratio of the @xmath0-process - time scales , characterizing the @xmath0-peak - maximum positions for the two values of @xmath1 , is also @xmath3-independent .",
    "these are two features which mct predicts to be universal .",
    "the first nonuniversal feature to be understood is , that the @xmath0-peak intensity , taken relative to that of the band of microscopic excitations at around 1thz , is larger for the ( @xmath1=1 ) response than for the ( @xmath1=2 ) case : the former exceeds the latter by about a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "second , the ( @xmath1=1 ) response is slower than the response for @xmath1=2 : the ratio of the @xmath0-peak positions is about @xmath17 .",
    "third , the @xmath0-peak of the ( @xmath1=1 ) response is less stretched than the peak for @xmath1=2 , i.e. the halfwidth of the ( @xmath1=1 ) peak is smaller than that of the ( @xmath1=2 ) peak .",
    "if one describes these peaks by the spectra of the kohlrausch law , @xmath18 , the stretching exponent @xmath2 for @xmath1=1 , @xmath19 @xcite , is larger than the one for @xmath1=2 , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the same three @xmath0-peak features are noticed , if one compares the depolarized - light - scattering spectra of glycerol @xcite with the corresponding dielectric - loss spectra @xcite .",
    "a fourth general feature to be explained is the large ratio of the @xmath0-relaxation - time scale found by depolarized - light - scattering spectroscopy and the one found for the longitudinal elastic modulus by brillouin - scattering spectroscopy . for salol ,",
    "a ratio of about 10 was reported @xcite , while for pc , a factor of about 5 was found @xcite .",
    "the small elongation of concern in this paper is chosen so that it exceeds the critical value for the above - mentioned type - a transition by about @xmath12% . the theory for the corrections to the leading - order asymptotic laws",
    "@xcite implies that these diverge at a type - a transition .",
    "therefore , the range of validity of the universality features of the standard mct bifurcation shrinks upon approaching the type - a transition .",
    "it will be shown that in our example the standard results are not exhibited any more for reasonable choices of the distance parameter @xmath21 .",
