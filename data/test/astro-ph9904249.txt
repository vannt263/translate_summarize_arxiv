    "the brightest star within the error circle ( figure  3 ) is the only one with broad emission lines and other spectral features that are characteristic of a reddened be star .",
    "be stars are often hard x - ray sources because of emission from an unseen compact companion such as a neutron star .",
    "no other star in the error box has optical spectroscopic properties resembling those of known hard x - ray sources . on this basis",

    "three sequences of 300  s exposures were taken on each night ( at the beginning middle , and end of the night ) , yielding a total of 39 spectra .",

    "the strong h@xmath19 emission line has a narrow core and very broad wings .",

    "the emission lines are double peaked , with peak separation of @xmath24  km  s@xmath20 and fwzi @xmath25  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "thus it appears that the narrow component identified in the moderate - resolution spectra as having fwhm @xmath26  km  s@xmath20 is actually resolved into a disk - like profile , similar to what is seen in the be star x - ray transient a0535 + 26 by clark et al .",

    "the individual kpno spectra were used to search for radial velocity variations of the h@xmath19 line over the three nights , but no significant variations were found .",
    "the scatter in the measured velocities appears to be random , and defines an upper limit to the real radial velocity variations on this time scale of 30  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "the _ observed _ johnson magnitudes ( johnson & morgan 1951 ) measured from the mean spectrum of figure  4 are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . absorption in many diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) is apparent in figure  4 , and the equivalent widths of these can be used to estimate reddening and distance .",
    "we measured four of the best - studied interstellar absorption features ; their ews are listed in table  1 .",
    "in addition to the ews , the depth of the @xmath30 feature was also measured to be 13% below the continuum ( this quantity is a reddening indicator in addition to the ew ) .",
    "there are several calibrations of the dibs in the literature .",
    "the most extensive work is that of herbig ( 1975 ) who studied the correlation of the ews of many dibs with reddening .",
    "wampler ( 1963 , 1966 ) noted that the calibration of the @xmath30 feature as a reddening indicator depends on galactic longitude .",
    "more recently , tg & schmidt - kaler ( 1981 ) also investigated this issue and came up with their own calibration for the depth of the @xmath30 feature .",
    "we estimated the extinction @xmath31 to sax  j0635 + 0533 using each of these calibrations , and adopted a mean value of @xmath32 , where the uncertainty corresponds to the dispersion among different calibrations . assuming that @xmath33",
    ", we find @xmath34 .",
    "the mon  ob2 association is a cluster of massive stars at a distance of 1620  pc ( garmany & stencel 1992 ) , and within @xmath35 of sax  j0635 + 0533 .",
    "the h  i column densities to 11 stars in this cluster have been measured with iue using lyman @xmath19 absorption and are in the range @xmath36 ( diplas & savage 1984 ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath31 to sax  j0635 + 0533 corresponds to @xmath37  @xmath38 using standard conversions ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "thus we can be confident that sax  j0635 + 0533 is no closer than the 1620  pc distance to mon ob2 .",
    "the mean column density to the 11 stars is @xmath39 . assuming that @xmath40 for @xmath41 , this corresponds to @xmath42  mag / kpc .",
    "if we assume that 0.8 mag / kpc is a typical value along the line of sight , the distance to sax  j0635 + 533 is probably not further than 5  kpc .",
    "the total galactic 21  cm column density in this direction is @xmath43  @xmath38 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is larger than the column density estimated for sax  j0635 + 0533 from interstellar absorption .",
    "thus , we regard the estimated extinction from the dibs as compatible with the 21  cm h  i column , while the larger x - ray measured value , @xmath44  @xmath38 , implies that there must be some circumstellar gas that is responsible for the extra x - ray absorption .",
    "we note that the emission - line ratio of h@xmath19/h@xmath22 can be used with recombination theory to derive an upper limit to @xmath31 of 1.4 , and that this upper limit is also well below the x - ray measured column .    after correction for reddening ,",
    "the johnson magnitudes estimated from the spectrum become @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "such colors are characteristic of an early b type star . for a distance range of 2.55",
    "kpc , the absolute visual magnitude would be in the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and the stellar classification in the range b2v to b1iii .",
    "assuming 200 be / x - ray binaries within 5  kpc ( rappaport & van den heuvel 1982 ) distributed uniformly in galactic longitude and in a latitude distribution with an rms width of @xmath50 , we estimate there is a 4% chance of finding a spurious overlap of a be / x - ray binary in an error box the size of that for 2eg  j0635 + 0521 .",
    "this probability is reasonably low .",
    "in addition , both be / x - ray binaries and the low - latitude egret sources are preferentially found near ob associations ( kaaret & cottam 1996 ) . this may suggest that some of the unidentified egret sources are , in fact , associated with be / x - ray binaries .    while identification of sax  j0635 + 0533 and its optical counterpart with 2eg  j0635 + 0521 must remain tentative awaiting an improved gamma - ray position or detection of periodicity in both x - rays and gamma - rays , the positional coincidence and the hard spectrum of the x - ray source are suggestive and here we entertain some speculations based on the possible identification . assuming the association of the x - ray source sax  j0635 + 0533 with the optical counterpart discussed above and with 2eg  j0635 + 0521 ,",
    "allows us to find the luminosity of the source based on the optical distance estimate .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray luminosity would be @xmath51 and the gamma - ray luminosity for 0.15  gev would be @xmath52 , both assuming isotropic emission .",
    "the x - ray to gamma - ray flux ratio is @xmath53 .",
    "if the identification is correct , then the source would be a gamma - ray emitting x - ray binary .",
    "it is possible that the binary contains a neutron star and that both the x - ray and gamma - ray emission are magnetospheric pulsar emission .",
    "if the binary is wide , as is tentatively suggested by our non - detection of radial velocity variations , then the pulsar emission may be be relatively uninfluenced by the presence of the companion star .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence in favor of pulsar emission .",
    "the ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray flux is consistent with those of `` vela - like '' pulsars .",
    "the power - law x - ray spectrum with photon index near 1.5 is similar to that of most isolated gamma - ray pulsars above 2  kev ( wang et al .",
    "the gamma - ray flux is constant over 14 different observations ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "1996 ) , as would be expected for a pulsar . and",
    "finally , as noted above , 2eg  j0635 + 0521 was identified by merck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as one of only eight unidentified galactic gamma - ray sources with energy spectra sufficiently hard to be pulsar candidates .",
    "alternatively , either the x - ray emission , gamma - ray emission , or both may arise from interaction of the energetic particle wind from the pulsar with the wind or the radiation from the companion .",
    "such mechanisms have been suggested for be / millisecond radio pulsar binary psr  j1259 - 63 and the variable radio be / x - ray binary system lsi  61@xmath54  303 . in psr  j1259 - 63 ,",
    "emission up to 200  kev is thought to arise from a shock interaction of the energetic particle wind from a pulsar with the wind from the be - star ( grove et al .",
    "1995 ) . the x - ray photon index , 1.51.9 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1995 ) , is similar to that we find for sax  j0635 + 0533 .",
    "however , psr  j1259 - 63 was not detected by egret ( tavani et al .",
    "1996 ) and the x - ray emission is highly variable .",
    "it is possible that the shock acceleration mechanism could operate to higher energies if the shock region is less compact than that of psr  j1259 - 63 at periastron ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray source 2cg  135 + 01 has long had a tentative association with the unusually variable radio source and be / x - ray binary lsi  61@xmath54  303 ( gregory & taylor 1978 ; for recent work see strickman et al .",
    "it has been suggested ( maraschi & treves 1981 ) that the source contains a young pulsar and that the gamma - rays arise from inverse - compton scattering of the optical photons from the b - star in the relativistic wind from the pulsar at the boundary between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind . however , 2cg  135 + 01 is a variable gamma - ray source ( tavani et al .",
    "if 2eg  j0635 + 0521 is similar to 2cg  135 + 01 , then the constancy of its gamma - ray flux ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "1996 ) would suggest a low eccentricity orbit .",
    "finally , it may be that the emission is powered not by rotation of a neutron star , but rather by accretion .",
    "the recently reported detection of gev pulsations from cen  x-3 with a frequency equal to that detected contemporaneously in x - rays ( vestrand , sreekumar , & mori 1997 ) , albeit not with an outstandingly high significance , suggests the possibility that 2eg  j0635 + 0521 could be an accretion powered system . the mechanism for gamma - ray production could be shock acceleration or a magnetospheric process .",
    "if sax  j0635 + 0533 is similar to cen  x-3 , the x - ray emission would be from accretion and should be pulsed .",
    "however , the lower bound we obtained for the exponential cutoff energy of the x - ray spectrum is significantly higher than the cutoffs typically found in high - mass x - ray binaries ( white , swank , & holt 1983 ) and would be more suggestive of either a low magnetic field neutron star or a black hole .",
    "identification of sax  j0635 + 0533 with the gamma - ray source 2eg  j0635 + 0521 would argue against interpreting the gamma - ray emission as due to cosmic - ray production via shock acceleration in the supernova remnant ( esposito et al .",
    "1996 ; jaffe et al .",
    "we note that we detect no diffuse hard x - ray emission in the bepposax data .",
    "possible ways to strength the identification of the x - ray / optical source and the gamma - ray source would be to detect a periodicity in the x - ray , optical , or radio which could then be detected in gamma - rays or to extend the x - ray spectrum and join it to the gamma - ray spectrum . finally ,",
