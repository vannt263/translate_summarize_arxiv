    "synthetic colloids are never perfectly monodisperse .",
    "often , this polydispersity is a drawback  for instance , polydispersity is a problem in the preparation of high - quality colloidal crystals , that are needed in photonic bandgap materials .",
    "however , occasionally , polydispersity is desirable , because it allows us to achieve material properties that can not be realized with monodisperse colloids .",
    "for instance , monodisperse colloidal systems can fill at most 74.05 % of space in the crystalline phase ( regular close packing ) and some 63% in the liquid / glassy state ( random close packing ) .",
    "in contrast , colloids with a properly chosen particle - size distribution can be made essentially space filling , both in the crystalline solid ( appolonian packing ) and in the liquid . in practice ,",
    "perfect space filling structures are never achieved because this requires an infinite number of ( predominantly small ) particles per unit volume . here",
    ", we consider a somewhat simpler problem , namely the filling of a given volume @xmath2 by a fixed number of particles @xmath0 , that occupy a prescribed total volume fraction @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the particles are free to exchange volume .",
    "as we have fixed both the number and the total volume of the particles , the average volume per particle is fixed ",
    "it defines the natural length - scale in the model .",
    "clearly , the helmholtz free energy of the system will depend on the non - fixed particle - size distribution . the distribution , however , is restricted by the two constraints of fixed number of particles and fixed total volume .",
    "we define the optimal size distribution to be the one that minimizes the helmholtz free energy under both constraints . in the monte carlo simulations ( performed in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble ) that we report in this paper , we study the density dependence of the particle - size distribution .",
    "we compare the simulation results for the size distribution with an analytical estimate that is obtained by solving the percus - yevick ( py ) equation for an @xmath0-component hard - sphere mixture@xcite . not surprisingly , the py equation works very well at low densities .",
    "however , the theory breaks down at a surprisingly low density ( @xmath40.26 ) . of course",
    ", the fact that an approximate theory fails at a given density , does not imply that there is anything special going on in the system at that density . yet , our simulations indicate that there is  the size distribution that was initially uni - modal , becomes bi - modal .",
    "we present a theoretical argument supporting this scenario .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ simu ] we describe the constant - pressure monte carlo simulations .",
    "the percus - yevick expression for the free energy of a system of polydisperse hard spheres with variable size distribution is discussed in section [ idealentr ] and [ theory ] .",
    "section [ sec : analytical ] is devoted to the derivation of analytical results turning useful when interpreting the simulation data . the mechanism behind the transition from uni - modal to bi - modal size distribution",
    "is also discussed .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed in the isothermal - isobaric ( constant @xmath5 ) ensemble @xcite .",
    "this means that the number of particles @xmath0 , the pressure @xmath6 and the temperature @xmath7 are fixed .",
    "we attempt three distinct types of trial moves .",
    "we change the positions of the particles and allow the volume of simulation box to fluctuate , in order to equilibrate with respect to the applied pressure .",
    "since we do not expect any crystalline order at low pressures , a cubic box shape is maintained .",
    "the third type of move is the one related to sampling the polydispersity of the system . to this end",
    ", we select two particles at random , between which we exchange an amount of volume drawn uniformly from the interval @xmath8 $ ] ( fig . [ poly_move ] ) .",
    "the maximum volume change @xmath9 was chosen such that the acceptance of a volume exchange move is between 35 and 50 % .",
    "the relative frequency of the three moves is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the initial configurations are made by @xmath0 monodisperse spheres on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "simulations were performed for system sizes of @xmath0=512 or 1000 , and several different reduced pressures @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the diameter of particles , and @xmath13 denotes an average over particle - size distribution .",
    "as @xmath14 is fixed , we choose @xmath15 to define the unit of length that we will use in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we use @xmath16 as our unit of energy .",
    "all other units that we need , follow from these definitions . the equation of state [ @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 and the particle size distribution function were determined in the simulations .",
    "the results for the equation of state are shown in fig .",
    "[ eq_of_state ] .",
    "the simulation data have been collected in table [ table - fequ1 ] . at low pressures",
    "the particle - size distribution function is a single - peaked function with its maximum at @xmath19 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : uni - bi ] , [ prob_dist_pres_0.50 ] and [ snap - low ] ) . at higher pressures ( typically , @xmath20 )",
    ", the particle - size distribution develops a second peak .",
    "actually , this second peak is quite small ( _ i.e. _ only a small fraction of all particles becomes `` large '' ) .",
    "however , these particles contribute appreciably to the total volume fraction ( fig .",
    "[ snap - high ] ) .",
    "depending on the pressure this contribution can get as large as 75% .",
    "the formation of big particles in these mc simulations is a rather slow `` dynamical '' process . in order to speed up calculations",
    ", we did additional simulations , in which we started with a bi - disperse distribution , with one or several big particles containing 99% of the total volume occupied by the spheres , surrounded by a sea of small particles containing the remaining volume . in the 512 particle system ,",
    "only one or two big particles remain for the lower pressures ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) . for higher pressures the number of big particles can stabilize at higher values as well . for the 1000 particle system",
    "the maximum number of big particles observed at the lower pressures is three .",
    "in addition , the size of these big particles is not the same .",
    "it is not clear whether this suggests a further possible fractionation or that it is a consequence of the slow equilibration and that one or more of the big particles are still shrinking .",
    "below , we discuss these simulation results in the context of the relevant theoretical predictions , but first let us stop to make certain considerations on the ideal entropy associated with this system .",
    "strictly speaking , the ideal entropy of a polydisperse system is infinite @xcite . in a multicomponent system",
    "such an entropy is exactly given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the molar fraction of species @xmath25 and @xmath26 its thermal wavelength .",
    "the usual path towards the entropy of a polydisperse system @xcite ( or for that matter , towards the entropy of continuous signals in information theory @xcite ) is to classify the species into `` boxes '' according to a certain property which distinguishes them ( diameter , volume , molecular weight , etc ) .",
    "if @xmath27 denotes such a property species @xmath25 will denote the box having particles with @xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for a given @xmath30 which defines the boxes . if @xmath31 denotes the probability density of a particle having the value @xmath27 for that property , then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a typical value of the @xmath25th box .",
    "( [ ideal1 ] ) adopts the form @xmath34 the entropy of the polydisperse system is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ideal2 ] ) taking the limit @xmath35 , and we can clearly see that , besides obtaining the usual expression @xcite @xmath36 \\ , , \\label{idealpoly}\\ ] ] there is also a divergent @xmath37 , which is simply taken as a `` constant '' ignorable term .",
    "but expression ( [ idealpoly ] ) is not well defined .",
    "suppose we simply change coordinates to label the species from @xmath27 to @xmath38 ( say , from the diameter to the volume ) .",
    "then the probability density in the new variable will be @xmath39 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in the new labeling the entropy becomes @xmath40+nk_b \\int dy\\ , \\widetilde w(y)\\ln\\left|\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|      \\ , , \\label{newideal}\\ ] ] which is different of what we would have obtained had we began with the labeling @xmath38 .",
    "this is a well known fact in information theory @xcite . in the study of fluid equilibria of _",
    "quenched _ polydisperse systems this fact turns out to be irrelevant because the new term simply adds the same constant to both sides of the equilibrium equations @xcite .",
    "however when studying _ annealed _ polydispersity this results tells us that the labeling is crucial and has to be dictated by the physical process underlying the polydispersity . in our case",
    "the monte carlo movements described in section [ simu ] are a large scale description of a hypothetical microscopic system of tiny particles of exactly the same size distributed among @xmath0 aggregates of a variable number of particles .",
    "the constant volume constraint would correspond to the conservation of the number of tiny particles , and the natural labeling of the aggregates would be the number of tiny particles which form it . as",
    "this number is proportional to the volume of the aggregate , in the continuum description is the volume , instead of the diameter , what turns out to be the natural labeling .",
    "notice that we could have described another model in which the tiny particles aggregated into spherical surfaces . in that case it would be the total surface what would be preserved and the natural labeling of aggregates would be their respective surfaces",
    ". as we will discuss in the conclusions , the physics of this model would be completely different .",
    "the percus - yevick equation for an @xmath41-component hard - sphere mixture can be solved analytically , to yield the following equation of state @xcite : @xmath42 the @xmath43-th moment of the particle - size distribution @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , the index @xmath25 is used to denote the different particle species , and @xmath47 is the volume of the @xmath25-th species .    equation ( [ py - eos ] ) is also valid for a continuous size distribution , in which case the sum in eq .",
