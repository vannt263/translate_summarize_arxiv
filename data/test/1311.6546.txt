    "[ sec : s1 ]    the compactness of its core is an important structural characteristic of a presupernova star that affects whether it will explode as a supernova .",
    "a shallow density gradient around the iron core , as typically exists in more massive stars , implies a higher accretion rate and  ram pressure  @xcite surrounding the iron core during its collapse that must be overcome by neutrino energy deposition or other energy deposition to turn what is initially an implosion into an explosion .",
    "the connection between this structure and the likelihood of explosion has been noted many times @xcite , but little attention has been given to explaining just why the compactness has the values that it does , or why different groups obtain different core structures for models with similar main sequence mass .",
    "recently , @xcite quantified this compactness in terms of a parameter , @xmath1    where m=2.5 @xmath0  was chosen as the relevant mass for quantifying the density gradient outside of the iron core , which itself typically has a mass in the range 1.4 to 2.0 @xmath0 . in oconnor",
    "et al s definition , the time , t@xmath2 , chosen for evaluating @xmath3 is when the core has collapsed to its maximum ( super - nuclear ) density . as we shall show (   [ sec : s2.3 ] ) , for m = 2.5 @xmath0 , no substantial accuracy is lost if this parameter is evaluated for the `` presupernova model '' defined by when the collapse speed first reaches 1000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the choice of m = 2.5 @xmath0  is justified as being larger than the iron core itself , yet deep enough in the star to sample matter that might accrete , especially in a failed explosion . since @xmath5  is inversely proportional to the radius of a fiducial mass outside the iron core",
    ", it is small when the density around the iron core falls off rapidly with radius and greater when the density gradient is shallow .",
    "that is , when @xmath5  is large , one need go only a shorter distance to include more mass .",
    "the systematics of neutrino - powered supernova explosions were explored as a function of @xmath5  by @xcite and @xcite , both of whom found that a small value of @xmath5  favored explosion .",
    "@xcite plotted @xmath5  as a function of main sequence mass for a variety of surveys due to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and a subset of that data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "note especially the distinctly non - monotonic behavior in the vicinity of 25 @xmath0  and 40 @xmath0 .    for a polytrope of constant index and composition supported by a constant fraction ( @xmath6 ) of ideal gas pressure , the compactness defined by equation  [ eq : compact ] will actually _ decrease",
    "_ monotonically with increasing mass when evaluated at a constant central temperature and small radius .",

    "* )    @xmath7    for a given @xmath8 the central density thus declines as @xmath9 and the radius required to enclose a given mass increases with m. as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : s3.1 ] , equation  [ eq : poly ] works reasonably well for massive stars that are burning hydrogen and helium in their centers .",
    "the inner regions of such stars are non - degenerate and can be well represented by polytropes of constant index .    as massive stars evolve , however , they develop nested cores with different compositions and entropies .",
    "lighter stars develop more degenerate cores in their late stages , especially during oxygen burning .",
    "the large gravitational potential at the edge of these degenerate cores implies a small pressure scale height that results in a steep decline in the local density @xcite . as a result , in heavier stars",
    ", the higher entropy actually leads to more extended configurations and larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "one does not have to to go out as far in the `` envelope '' of the compact core to encompass 2.5 @xmath0 , while in lighter stars that mass is reached farther out .",
    "this accounts for a general tendency of the compactness parameter for presupernova stars to increase with mass , especially for low metallicity stars where mass loss is less important .",

    "[ fig : f1 ] also shows that the core compactness has significant non - monotonic behavior above about 20 @xmath0 , and possibly some fine structure below 20 @xmath0 .",
    "if this behavior is real and robust , it would have interesting implications for the explosion mechanism(s ) for massive stars , the masses of their compact remnants , and stellar nucleosynthesis . to address the `` real and robust '' issue ,",
    "it is necessary to understand why this non - monotonic structure exists and its sensitivity to uncertainties and variations in the stellar models .",
    "the present study has several parts , some dealing with the systematics of @xmath5  found in new surveys of massive stars , others with the uncertainties one should assign to those results . in   [",
    "sec : s2 ] , three new surveys of massive stellar evolution are presented for stars of solar metallicity , very low metallicity ( 10@xmath11 solar ) , and solar metallicity with suppressed mass loss . these new surveys , though using the same physics as in previous works @xcite , are needed to provide a finer mass grid for examining rapid fluctuations in @xmath5  and to give additional data not archived in previous work . in ",
    "[ sec : s3 ] , we address the heart of the matter : why is the compactness a non - monotonic function and , in some places , almost chaotic function of main sequence mass . the timing and location of several carbon and oxygen convective shells are found to play a major role .",
    "because there are multiple episodes of shell burning , the final compactness can be quite complex . in ",
    "[ sec : s4 ] the sensitivity of these results to uncertain assumptions in the physics used in two stellar evolution codes , kepler and mesa , is explored .",
    "these uncertainties , especially the treatment of semiconvection and convective overshoot mixing , lead to large variations in the final co core mass that emerges for a given main sequence mass and account for much of the diversity of published results for presupernova evolution .",
    "since these uncertainties cloud the interpretation of the compactness plot , a further study is carried out in   [ sec : s5 ] for bare co stars using both codes . provided the carbon mass fractions at carbon ignition are the same as in the full star models ,",
    "the same trends seen previously for the compactness parameter are also found in these simpler cores , albeit with an offset due to surface boundary pressure in the full star .",
    "thus the non - monotonicity of @xmath5  can be considered robust and the co core mass is a somewhat better indicator of pre - supernova structure ( and to some extent explosion dynamics ) than the main sequence mass . finally , ",
    "[ sec : s6 ] offers some conclusions .",
    "[ sec : s2 ]      the models published in @xcite were aimed at sampling supernova nucleosynthesis and light curves for a broad range of non - rotating stars of solar metallicity .",
    "the resolution in mass necessary for that purpose was not particularly fine , so that study has been repeated using the same code and physics , but with a finer mass grid .",
    "the prescriptions for nuclear reaction rates , mass loss , opacity , convective overshoot mixing , and semiconvection are the same as in the previous survey . for the assumed mass loss rates @xcite , the entire hydrogen envelope is lost for stars with initial masses above 33 @xmath0 .",

    "altogether , 151 models were simulated using the standard physics ( for variations see   [ sec : s4 ] ) .",
    "nuclear energy generation was calculated , up to oxygen depletion ( central oxygen mass fraction less than 0.04 ) , using a 19 isotope network @xcite .",
    "a quasi - statistical equilibrium network and a nuclear statistical equilibrium network were used thereafter . however",
    ", a much larger `` adaptive '' network of up to 1500 isotopes was carried in parallel with the main structure calculation @xcite and was used to calculate changes in the electron mole number , @xmath12 .",
    "this was particularly important during oxygen burning when the quasi - equilibrium network could not be employed , but substantial weak interactions were already changing the central structure .",
    "this is the same approach that was used by @xcite , but a substantial improvement over what was done in @xcite .",
    "these models are collectively referred to as the `` s series '' stars - for `` solar '' .",
    "in addition to confirming the distinct  bump  previously seen around 23 @xmath0  the new study ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) shows other interesting features .",
    "fine scale variation of the compactness parameter persists throughout most of the mass range , but is particularly apparent between 19 and 21 @xmath0 .",
    "these features are further explored in ",

    "@xmath5  is small for main sequence stars lighter than 22 @xmath0 .",
    "it then rises rapidly to a peak , but declines again to lower values for main sequence masses between 26 @xmath0  and 30 @xmath0 . above about 30 @xmath0 ,",
    "results for these solar metallicity stars are clouded by the effects of mass loss reducing the helium core mass , but if mass loss is suppressed , the compactness stays large above 40 @xmath0  with a slight dip around 50 @xmath0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] and @xmath13 ) .",
    "these features pose a challenge to the conventional notion that the difficulty of exploding a star is a monotonically increasing function of its initial mass and instead imply that models below 22 @xmath0  and between 26 @xmath0  and 30 @xmath0  may be easier to blow - up than other masses .",
    "this could alter how we think about the galactic chemical evolution @xcite .    in order to facilitate the comparison with low metallicity stars where the mass loss rate may be negligible , another series of solar metallicity models was calculated for stars above 30 @xmath0  in which mass loss was artificially suppressed .",

    "[ sec : s2.2 ]    stars with equal masses on the main sequence , but differing initial metallicity can have different presupernova structure for a variety of reasons .",
    "most importantly , metallicity affects the mass loss . if the amount of mass lost is very low or zero , the presupernova star , including its helium core , is larger , and that has a dramatic effect on the compactness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "there are also other less dramatic , but important effects .",
    "low metallicity implies a smaller initial helium mass fraction ( and more hydrogen ) .",
    "the final helium core mass is sensitive to this and is reduced .",
    "nitrogen has an abundance just prior to helium ignition that is directly proportional to the initial metallicity and `` nitrogen burning '' by @xmath16n(@xmath17f(@xmath18o is an important exoergic , convective phase in the star s life that precedes helium burning .",
    "low metallicity affects the energy generation during hydrogen shell burning by the cno cycle , and this affects the boundary conditions for the helium core .",
    "low metallicity also affects the opacity , and the combined effects of opacity , energy generation , and mass loss determine if the star is a red supergiant or a blue one when it dies .",
    "this is especially true for the non - rotating stars studied here .",
    "the more compact radiative structure of a blue supergiant envelope places greater surface boundary pressure on the helium core therein and can affect its evolution .",
    "to illustrate the systematics of compactness in stars of low metallicity , we include here a previously unpublished set of non - rotating presupernova stars by heger and woosley with metallicity of 10@xmath11 @xmath10 .",
    "these used the same physics as the s series , but had an initial composition of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium with only a trace , 10@xmath11 solar , of heavier elements .",
    "the masses of these stars were 10 to 95 @xmath0 , though only a subset , 15 - 65 @xmath0 , is considered here .",

    "the core masses are not very sensitive to metallicity . above 35 @xmath0 ,",
    "the helium core is somewhat larger for the higher metallicity stars reflecting a more active hydrogen - burning shell during helium burning .",
    "[ fig : f4],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the compactness of these low metallicity models is shown , along with those from s and sh series , in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] . without mass loss , a much larger range of helium and co - core masses is accessible ( figure 4 ) .",
    "one sees a continuation of the overall increase in compactness parameter with increasing mass all the way up to 65 @xmath0 , but with new features .",
    "the compactness rises rapidly above 30 @xmath0  to a broad peak around 40 @xmath0  and then , following a dip at 50 @xmath0 , resumes its rise .",
    "all of the stars above 30 @xmath0 , with no mass loss , will probably be very difficult to explode by any solely neutrino - powered mechanism .",
    "mass fraction at the time of core carbon ignition is shown for s ( thick upper curve ) , sh ( dashed ) and u ( thinner lower curve ) stars .",
    "note that the carbon mass fraction is smaller in stars that ignore mass loss and that the sh series tracks the u series very well .",
    "[ fig : f5],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    below 30 @xmath0 , the compactness curve for the u series shows non - monotonic structure with peaks qualitatively similar to those observed for the s series in figure 2 , but with an offset of about a solar mass .",
    "the offset is most pronounced in the range 20 - 25 @xmath0  where the compactness starts to rise in the u series for a lower value of main sequence mass .",
    "the main cause of this shift is the lower mass fraction of carbon produced by helium burning in the u stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "that value , in turn , affects the critical mass where carbon ceases to burn convectively in the star s center (   [ sec : s3.1 ] ) , shifting it to lower values , which causes the compactness curve to rise earlier (   [ sec : s3 ] ) .",
    "thus end their lives as blue supergiants .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    this variable nucleosynthesis of carbon for the s and u stars results from differing amounts of helium being mixed into the convective helium core as it grows during the final stages of helium burning .",
    "in fact , the carbon mass fractions for s and u stars in this mass range are very similar half way through helium burning , but as the helium mass fraction declines below 10% , the u stars are more effective at bringing additional helium in from their outer regions .",
    "each helium convected down turns a carbon into an oxygen .",
    "the u stars have somewhat higher helium core luminosities at this point and the structure at the outer edge of the helium convection is also influenced by surface boundary pressure from the hydrogen envelope which is different for red and blue supergiants .",
    "below 30 @xmath0 , the u - series stars are blue supergiants while the s - series stars are red ones ( fig .  [",
    "fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "the pressure at the edge of the helium core does not decline as steeply in a blue supergiant and the entropy barriers inhibiting convection in the outer helium core are slightly reduced .",
    "this makes the growth of the helium convective core easier .",
    "convective dredge up in a red supergiant could also possibly reduce the helium core mass , though this effect seems to be small in the present models . with rotation , many of these lighter u - stars would also be red supergiants in the end because of primary nitrogen production at the hydrogen - helium interface , and the effect would be diminished . above 30 @xmath0",
    "the structure of the sh and u stars are very similar because both are red supergiants .    in the past",
    ", it has sometimes been assumed that the helium core mass uniquely determines the presupernova structure of a star and hence that structure would be roughly independent of the metallicity for two stars that made the same helium core mass . while this is qualitatively true ,",
    "the figures here show that this assumption is not very accurate for supernova progenitors below 30 @xmath0 .",
    "[ sec : s2.3 ]    with the new surveys , it is possible to address a point of possible concern - the choice of mass ( 2.5 @xmath0 ) and time ( `` presn model '' ) for evaluating the compactness in equation  [ eq : compact ] .",
    "the full evolution of a massive star to the point that its iron core collapses and possibly powers an explosion is being characterized by a single number here . what motivates the choice of this particular point in space and time ?",
    "@xcite explored the effect of evaluating @xmath19 at different fiducial masses and concluded that 1.75 @xmath0  might be a better discriminant of explosion characteristics rather than the 2.5 @xmath0  chosen here and in @xcite .",
    "the time of core bounce rather than initial collapse ( `` presn '' ) also seemed a more relevant time for its evaluation .",
    "recently , @xcite also examined the choice of 1.75@xmath0 , since the early neutrino signal is more sensitive to the structure around the neutron star .",
    "obviously smaller choices than 1.75 @xmath0  would not be sensible since they often lie _ within _ the collapsing iron core itself , and depend on different physics that occurs after that core has already reached high density , but what about values in between ?    to address these questions ,",
    "the collapse of the s series was continued until the central density reached @xmath20 g @xmath21 .",
    "this is about 100 times greater than the central density of presupernova s - series stars .",
    "beyond this point , neutrino trapping and , ultimately , the nuclear equation of state , would influence the dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath19 rises with increasing central density since a smaller radius encloses the same mass .",
    "it also rises as the mass chosen for its evaluation decreases , since the average density enclosed by r increases faster than r@xmath22 . running kepler",
    "well beyond @xmath23 g @xmath21 to nuclear density gives values of questionable accuracy , but strongly suggests that very little further evolution will occur in the compactness so long as the sampling mass remains greater than 1.75 @xmath0 .",
    "as the figure shows , the compactness evaluated at 2.5 @xmath0  changes very little during the collapse from the presupernova star to high central density . at that larger radius ,",
    "the hydrodynamical response time is longer than the time for the denser part of the core to collapse .",
    "( red ) , and later when the central density reaches @xmath24 g @xmath21 ( blue )",

    "little evolution occurs during the collapse from about @xmath25 g @xmath21 to @xmath26 g @xmath21 if the compactness is evaluated at 2.5 @xmath0 , but for smaller fiducial masses the contrasts seen at 2.5 @xmath0  are significantly amplified with time .",
    "[ fig : f7],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    substantial variation does occur , however , for smaller sampling masses .",
    "smaller fiducial masses show a non - linear amplification of the structure in the compactness curve with time .",
    "large values get much larger than adjacent smaller ones , suggesting the development of islands of stars that may be hard to blow up .",
    "this is due to the tendency of high density regions to collapse faster under the influence of their own gravity and is particularly apparent for stars in the 18 to 22 @xmath0  mass range .",
    "this may account for some of the variability in outcome seen by @xcite for supernovae in this mass range .",
    "the robustness of @xmath5  evaluated at 2.5 @xmath0 , however , and its strong correlation with the compactness evaluated at smaller masses suggests that we can continue to use our standard choices of time and mass for its evaluation .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that structures that seem small in some of the plots for presupernova stars may become amplified by the further collapse .",
    "[ sec : s3 ]    surveys of stellar evolution find a complex , non - monotonic behavior for the compactness parameter as a function of main sequence mass and metallicity .",
    "why is this so ?",
    "why does nt the compactness vary smoothly with mass as it would in a polytrope with a single index ?    four factors drive the development of the compactness profile for massive presupernova stars .",
    "one obvious effect is the contraction of the core to higher densities in order to burn heavier fuels .",
    "this contraction increases the average density inside 2.5 @xmath0  and causes @xmath5  to grow with time .",
    "another is the tendency of lighter stars to have lower entropy cores and be more degenerate .",
    "degeneracy is responsible for the transition between stars that make planetary nebulae and those that make supernovae around 8 @xmath0 , but the effects of degeneracy on the post - carbon burning evolution continue to be important throughout the entire mass range studied here .",
    "third , as has been noted previously @xcite , is the disappearance , around , 20 @xmath0 , of central convective carbon core burning . above 20 @xmath0 , carbon fuses away without contributing a large excess of energy generation over what neutrinos are carrying away in the center of the star .",

    "the convective carbon core burning starts about 1000 years before death and is followed by three episode of carbon shell burning .",
    "oxygen burning starts about two years before death and is preceded by a brief stage of neon burning .",
    "silicon burning is the last convective episode in the center . at silicon depletion ,",
    "no oxygen shell is active , only a carbon shell at about 1.9 @xmath0 . shortly afterwards",
    "though , the third oxygen shell ignites in the incompletely burned ashes of the second shell .",
    "this final vigorous shell merges with the carbon and some neon burning shells shortly before the star dies .",
    "the operation of these shells , especially the ones between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath0 , affects the compactness parameter.[fig : f8 ] , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    fourth and frequently overlooked ( though see barkat 1994 ) are the effects of convective carbon and oxygen shell burning .",
    "lighter stars can have three or more carbon burning shells in addition to core carbon burning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] ) .",
    "as these stars evolve , their central regions become increasingly degenerate , especially after carbon depletion in the star s center , and , by oxygen ignition , the concept of a chandrasekhar mass has some approximate meaning , especially for stars lighter than 30 @xmath0 .",
    "shells that burn outside the effective chandrasekhar mass , roughly 1.7 @xmath0  depending on thermal corrections , but inside the point where the compactness is measured at 2.5 @xmath0 , will considerably modulate the compactness parameter .",

    "[ fig : f9 ] shows that @xmath5  remains nearly independent of the main sequence mass until after carbon ignites in the core .",
    "prior to this time , the fiducial point at 2.5 @xmath0  lies well within a much larger star or helium core that can be characterized by a single polytropic index .",
    "the tendency of @xmath28 to decrease as @xmath29 , as given by equation  [ eq : poly ] , is offset by the slight increase of the burning temperature with mass , resulting in a nearly flat curve .",
    "as a function of main sequence mass for the s series models up to the point when the carbon mass fraction decreases below 1% in the center of the star ( `` c.dep '' ) . at each successive stage ,",

    "below about 20 @xmath0  carbon burns convectively in the core and this reduces @xmath5.[fig : f9 ] , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    by the time carbon has disappeared from the center of the star though , things have started to change .",
    "a pronounced dip in @xmath5  develops for the lower mass stars , and the curve shows an abrupt , small rise at 20 @xmath0 . for current code physics and solar metallicity ,",
    "20 @xmath0  is the mass below which carbon burns convectively ( exoergically ) at the stellar center as opposed to radiatively ( endoergically ) .",
    "convection brings additional fuel into the burning region increasing the effective supply by approximately the ratio of the convective mass to the mass of the burning region .",
    "because of the high temperature sensitivity of the carbon fusion reaction , the energy generating region is small , so the enhancement is significant . during this longer time , neutrino losses carry away both energy and entropy , not only from the carbon convective core , but from the hot , overlying helium - rich layers supported by it .",
    "this loss of entropy exacerbates the natural tendency of lighter cores to have greater degeneracy and accelerates the development of a compact , white dwarf - like core structure - a dense degenerate core surrounded by a much less dense extended envelope .",

    "the cores of the lower mass models grow much more degenerate due to neutrino losses between carbon depletion and oxygen ignition .",

    "the growth of the helium convection zone results from a different structure at its outer edge which , in turn , is affected by the strength of the hydrogen shell , whether the star is a red or blue supergiant , and how much hydrogenic envelope remains following mass loss ( in the solar metallicity stars ) . even with mass loss suppressed , a substantial",
    "offset remains between presupernova stars of solar and low metallicity .",
    "generally speaking , the low metallicity stars become difficult to blow up at a lower mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) and may make more black holes .    the underlying cause for the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath5  with initial mass derives from the interaction of carbon - burning and oxygen - burning shells with the carbon - depleted and , later , oxygen depleted core (   [ sec : s3 ] ) . as has been noted previously , the end of convective carbon core burning at around 20 @xmath0  for standard stellar physics , has a major effect , but not so much due to the entropy decrease during central carbon burning itself as to the effect this has on the ensuing shells . above 20 @xmath0 , both central carbon burning and what was the first convective shell switch to radiative transport .",
    "energy generation in excess of pair neutrino losses is unable to support core against further contraction , and the next two carbon convective shells are pulled down .",
    "their gradual migration outwards again causes the rise and decline , and rise again of @xmath5  above 20 @xmath0 . above 30 @xmath0",
    ", @xmath5  rises to large values and , in the absence of mass loss , keeps on rising .",
    "there is an appreciable dip at about 50 @xmath0 , though , due to the outward migration of the oxygen shell which essentially plays the same role as the carbon shells did for lower mass stars .    broadly speaking , then",
    ", the evolution of massive stars separates into four mass intervals characterized by similar values of @xmath5 . for a standard choice of physics and solar metallicity these are stars from 8 to 22 @xmath0 , 22 - 25 @xmath0 , 25 - 30 @xmath0 , and above 30 @xmath0(e.g . , fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "stars below 22 @xmath0  and between 25 and 30 @xmath0  have low @xmath5  and might more easily explode . between 22 and 25 @xmath0and above 30 @xmath0",
    ", it will be more difficult for the traditional neutrino - transport model to succeed . there can be large variations within those ranges and not all stars lighter than 22 @xmath0  will be easy to explode @xcite , but the distribution of stars that make black holes , for example , or important contributions to nucleosynthesis could be bi - modal .",
    "galactic chemical evolution studies using such non - monotonic yields have yet to be done , but may give quite different results , e.g. , for the s - process and oxygen synthesis @xcite .",
    "while the pattern seen in @xmath5  _ vs _ mass is robust , the locations of its peaks and valleys are sensitive to the treatment of semiconvection and convective overshoot in the code .",
    "these cause variations in the mass of the co core and the carbon mass fraction when carbon burning ignites . reducing semiconvection or convective",
    "overshoot makes the co core smaller and this is a leading cause of the large variations seen in the literature for many studies of presupernova ( table  [ tab : cocore ] ) .",
    "smaller co cores can mimic the effect of reducing the main sequence mass in a calculation where the convection physics is held constant and thus make cores with steep surrounding density gradients up to a higher mass .",
    "however these cores , while easier to blow up will be essentially nucleosynthetically barren .",
    "extremely small values for semiconvective efficiency and overshoot mixing can lead to a discrepancy between the lightest stars expected to explode as supernovae based upon observations , about 8 @xmath0 , and that calculated by theory .",
    "caution must be exercised when using the co core mass as a discriminant , however , because the outcome is also very sensitive to the carbon mass fraction , and even to the treatment of convection after helium depletion .",
    "most of the models in this paper were calculated using the kepler code , but the mesa code was also used to calculate the compactness curve at oxygen deletion where its essential features have already been determined .",
    "reasonable agreement is achieved between the two codes provided that some amount of semiconvection and convective overshoot mixing is used in both .",
    "the non - monotonic nature of the compactness plot , in particular , is apparent in the results of both surveys .",
    "the effects of varying the uncertain reaction rate for @xmath70c(@xmath71o within its error range were also explored and found to have an appreciable effect .",
    "a total error of just 10% in the combined error for 3 @xmath72 and @xmath70c(@xmath71o can shift features in the compactness plot by a solar mass or more . to the extent the compactness is related to the difficulty of exploding a given model using neutrinos",
    ", the changes for nucleosynthesis and supernova `` cut - off mass '' are significant at that level .    and binding energies for presupernova stars of the s series ( top : ) the binding energy above the iron core shown as a function of initial mass .",
    "despite the general increasing baseline trend , the relative variations closely follow that of @xmath5 .",
    "( bottom : ) the final value of @xmath5  is plotted against the binding energy outside of the iron core .",
    "[ fig : f28],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    because the co core mass plays such a major role in determining @xmath5 , we explored its systematics using a grid of `` bare '' co - cores .",
    "these differ from the co cores of massive stars which are defined by composition changes and do not have sharp declines in density and pressure at their edges .",
    "nevertheless , the same non - monotonic compactness curve results .",
    "this both confirms the robustness of the @xmath5  relation found in the other surveys and suggests that , for a given presupernova model , its final co core mass , not its main sequence mass might be a more accurate structural indicator .",
    "the same behavior was found for co cores studied using mesa . picking the co core mass",
    "circumvents some , though certainly not all of the uncertainty introduced by ambiguous treatments of semiconvection and convective overshoot mixing during core helium burning . for wr stars and other stars that have experienced severe mass loss ,",
    "the presupernova co core mass will be the best indicator of presupernova structure .",
    "even for bare co cores , however , the mass fraction of carbon at carbon ignition remains an important `` hidden variable '' that will be sensitive to both the code physics and the metallicity of the star .",
    "while this paper has emphasized the relation between compactness of the core and its explodability in terms of the neutrino transport model , the results are actually more general .",
    "[ fig : f28 ] shows the binding energy of the matter outside of the iron core of the presupernova star as a function of its compactness .",
    "stars with larger values of @xmath5  will be more difficult to explode by _ any _ mechanism , both because of the higher ram pressure immediately after collapse and the larger energy needed to eject the matter outside the iron core .",
