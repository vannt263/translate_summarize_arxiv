    "nova outbursts are thermonuclear runaway events on white dwarfs .",
    "depending on the binary parameter such as the mass accretion rate , composition of the envelope and the white dwarf mass , nova outbursts shows a wide variety of the recurrence period , its light curve , the duration time and expanding speed of gaseous matter and so on .",
    "classical nova shows enhancement of carbon and oxygen or other white dwarf material in its ejecta .",
    "the recurrence period is as long as ten thousand of years or so and we can observe only one outburst for one nova binary . on the other hand ,",
    "recurrent novae repeat outbursts every several to several - tens of years and its ejecta shows no enhancement of white dwarf material .",
    "after the onset of shell flash , the white dwarf rapidly brightens up and the envelope greatly extend to a giant size and the strong wind mass - loss begins to blow the envelope mass . after the star reaches the optical maximum the photospheric radius reduces with increasing effective temperature , which causes the decay of visual light curve .",
    "the mass loss during nova outburst is a radiation - driven wind which is accelerated deep inside the photosphere ( friedjung 1966 ) .",
    "such a wind is called as the optically thick wind .",
    "the decay phase of nova outbursts is followed by a quasi - evolution theory ( summarized in kato & hachisu 1994 ) which is to make a sequence of optically thick wind solutions of expanding envelope .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows the run of the opacity throughout an envelope of a classical nova model .",
    "the opal opacity has a strong peak owing to iron lines at @xmath1 which locates deep inside the photosphere .",
    "this opacity peak blocks radiative flux to accelerate the wind mass - loss . as shown in the right figure the wind velocity increases quickly at the temperature region corresponding to this opacity peak .",
    "the wind velocity already reaches the terminal velocity at the photosphere . in the optically thick wind",
    "the mass - loss rate is very large , because the acceleration occurs deep inside where the density is high .",
    "it is naturally understood that the velocity and the mass - loss rate of winds are larger for larger metallicity , i.e. , larger in population i than in population ii novae .",
    "the evolutionary course of the decay phase in h - r diagram is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the decay phase of the classical nova and the recurrent nova with different composition is similar to the curves in figure 2 ( see kato 1997 for classical novae , kato 1999 for recurrent novae ) .    at the optical peak",
    "the star reaches the maximum radius which point locates somewhere in the right side of each curve .",
    "as the strong wind blows out the envelope mass , the photospheric radius moves inward and the effective temperature rises , thus the star moves leftward .",
    "the wind mass - loss occurs in the dashed parts . after the wind stops ,",
    "the star still goes leftward until nuclear burning extinguishes at the small dot . in less massive stars ,",
    "the acceleration is not enough to cause the optically thick wind .    in massive white dwarfs ,",
    "the evolutionary speed is short mainly because of the small envelope mass which is blown off within a short time by the wind .",
    "therefore , the nova outburst is fast in massive white dwarfs and slow in less massive stars . in a lowest limit of white dwarfs ,",
    "the acceleration is weak to cause the optically thick wind .",
    "the wind acceleration also depends on the metallicity as shown in the left figure .",
    "the larger iron content , the stronger peak of the opacity that causes a strong wind . in @xmath2 , shell flashes do not occur or very weak in @xmath3 white dwarf for classical novae , and @xmath4 for recurrent / symbiotic novae . in @xmath5 , shell flashes do not occur or very weak in @xmath6 for classical nova , and @xmath7 for recurrent / symbiotic nova .",
    "the decay phase of nova outburst is followed by the optically thick wind theory .",
    "the method of light curve fitting of nova is firstly established in nova cygni 1978 ( kato 1994 ) .",
    "the wind mass - loss rate depends strongly on the white dwarf mass , therefore , we can determine the white dwarf mass from the light curve fitting . in case of nova cygni 1978",
    ", the two independent fittings of optical and uv light curves give the same values of white dwarf mass of @xmath8 and the distance to the star .",
    "nova cygni 1978 is a moderately fast nova .",
    "more rapid evolution is predicted only in more massive white dwarfs .",
    "light curve fittings of several classical novae show a fast classical nova corresponds to a very massive white dwarf ( @xmath9 ) , moderately classical nova such as nova cyg 1978 , correspond a moderately massive white dwarf ( @xmath10 ) , and slow evolution of slow novae , the less massive white dwarf(@xmath11 for nova mus 1985 ) .",
    "it is very interesting that the fastest limit of classical nova corresponds to the massive limit of the white dwarf , and the slowest one the lowest limit .",
    "recurrent nova and symbiotic nova can be treated as a same subgroup of nova , that shows no white dwarf material enhancement .",
    "the difference between the two is in the white dwarf mass and the contribution of the companion and the accretion disk .",
    "the similar relation to classical nova , i.e. , the relation between the evolutionary speed of light curves and white dwarf mass , also stands in these novae",
    ". most rapid evolution of some recurrent novae corresponds very massive white dwarf close to the upper limit ( @xmath12 as shown above ) and slow evolution the moderately massive white dwarfs ( e.g. , @xmath13 for t pyx ) .",
    "very long duration of some symbiotic novae corresponds low - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath14 for symbiotic nova rx pup ) .",
    "using binary models composed by a white dwarf , an accretion disk and a companion , we have calculated theoretical light curve of recurrent novae . in the first phase , the envelope largely expand to about several tens of the binary size , and the companion are deeply embedded by the envelope . as the strong wind carries away most of the expanding envelope , the photospheric radius moves inward , and in the later phase , we can see the companion and the accretion disk again .",
    "the early phase of the light curve is determined by the wind mass - loss rate . in the following plateau phase the accretion disk and the partly irradiated companion",
    "contribute the visual magnitude .",
    "therefore , in this stage , we have calculated visual flux summing up of three component , of the white dwarf photosphere , the irradiated accretion disk , and the partly irradiated companion that is shadowed by the accretion disk .",
    "we divided their surfaces into 9000 small areas and calculated emission flux from each areas to sum up .",
    "the recurrent nova u sco , v394 cra , ci aql , and v2487 oph are members of the subclass of u sco type that have a slightly - evolved main - sequence companion .",
    "u scorpii is one of the well observed recurrent novae , characterized by the shortest recurrence period @xmath15 yr , the fastest decline of its light curve 0.6 mag per day , its extremely helium - rich ejecta he / h@xmath16 by number .",
    "the latest outburst in 1999 was well observed from the rising phase to the cooling phase by many observers including eclipses which provide us a unique opportunity to construct a comprehensive model for u sco during the outburst .",
    "we have reproduced the light curves by binary model as shown in figure 3 . to fit the early linear decay phase ( @xmath17 days after maximum ) , we have calculated total 140 @xmath18-magnitude light curves with various wd mass , hydrogen content the envelope , where the heavy element content @xmath19 is fixed , and companion mass .",
    "we choose @xmath20 as a limiting mass just before the sn ia explosion in w7 model ( @xmath21 ) of nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi ( 1984 ) .",
    "the early 7 days light curve hardly depends on the chemical composition or the companion mass but mainly depends on the white dwarf mass .",
    "the @xmath22 light curve is in much better agreement with the observations than the other wd masses . in the middle plateau phase",
    ", the irradiated accretion disk mainly contributed to @xmath18 light , because the white dwarf photosphere shrinks to a small size and shadowed by the accretion disk .    to fit the cooling phase ( @xmath23 days after maximum )",
    ", we must adopt very small hydrogen content of @xmath24 among other values .",
    "this is because the hydrogen content , @xmath25 , determines the period of hydrogen steady shell burning , i.e. , the period of the mid - plateau phase . in our model , the optically thick wind stops at @xmath26 days , and the steady hydrogen shell - burning ends at @xmath27 days .",
    "in the evolutional course of the outburst , the visual magnitude drops and uv and soft x - ray fluxes increases .",
    "it is because the photospheric temperature increases after the optical peak , because the main emitting region moves blueward ( to uv then to soft x - ray ) .",
    "this picture is very consistent with the bepposax supersoft x - ray detection @xmath28 days after the optical peak ( kahabka , et al .",
    "in the strong wind phase we can not expect much of supersoft x - rays because of self - absorption by the wind itself .    in this way , the light curve fitting gives us an estimate for binary parameters , such as the white dwarf mass and chemical composition of the envelope , and if orbital period is available , we further know the mass transfer rate and the growth rate of the white dwarf mass .",
    "v394 cra is a twin system that shows very similar light curves . in the same way as in u sco ,",
    "we have reproduced light curve of v394 cra and determined the white dwarf mass to be 1.37 @xmath0 and @xmath24 with @xmath19 as shown in figure 4 ( hachisu & kato 2000b )    the light curve analysis of ci aql and v2487 oph is separately reported in detail in this conference proceedings ( hachisu et al . for v2487 oph , hachisu & kato for ci aql ) .",
    "the white dwarf mass of these two recurrent novae are also massive , 1.2 @xmath0 for ci aql and 1.35 @xmath0 for v2487 oph .",
    "rs oph , t crb , v745 sco and v3890 sgr are a subclass of recurrent nova with a red giant companion .",
    "as the companion substantially contributes the light curve in later phase , we have calculated huge number of binary models with different parameters and choose a configuration which gives the best fitted light curve .",
    "figure 5 ( left ) shows the binary configuration of t crb selected in this way .",
    "the cool component ( right ) is a red giant filling up its inner critical roche lobe .",
    "its hemisphere is heated up by the hot component ( @xmath29 white dwarf , left ) .",
    "the surface of the accretion disk is also heated up .",
    "the light curve fitting is shown in the right figure .",
    "if we do not include the contribution of irradiation from the companion , the summation of the @xmath18 light of the white dwarf photosphere and the red giant photosphere is very small in the later phase as shown by the dotted line .",
    "the dash - dotted line denotes the case if we include the irradiation from partly heated rg photosphere , and the solid line the case if we further include the irradiation form the accretion disk .",
    "we assume a tilting accretion disk as in the left figure with precession at a period of about 140 days .",
    "the disk in t crb meets the condition of instability against radiation - induced warping ( pringle 1996 ) with the disk size , bolometric luminosity , the mass of the white dwarf mass accretion rate obtained our light curve fitting .",
    "the accretion disks in rs oph and other two systems do not meet this instability condition mainly because of small disk size .",
    "therefore , we can not expect the secondary peak for these other three systems .",
    "this is the reason that makes t crb a very unique nova with the prominent secondary peak ( hachisu & kato 2001 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows light curve fitting of rs oph . in the early phase",
    "the development of light curve is determined by the wind mass loss , which depend only on the white dwarf mass and the heavy element composition of the envelope .",
    "there are some observational indication that this object is an old population , thus we have calculated theoretical curves with different metallicities and white dwarf masses .",
    "the left figure shows one of such trial fittings that shows , if @xmath30 , the best fit curve is obtained with extremely massive white dwarf @xmath31 . this is a very critical value just before a type ia supernova explosion ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 )    the right figure shows the light curve fitting of entire phase of outburst . in the later phase ,",
    "the accretion disk and the irradiated companion substantially contribute the @xmath18 light curve and we determine the shape and the size of the accretion disk ( hachisu & kato 2000a , hachisu & kato 2001 ) .",
    "the optically thick wind blows during the period from the first phase of the outburst ( hjd 2,446,092 ) to 79 days after the maximum ( hjd 2,446,170 ) .",
    "the steady hydrogen shell burning ends at 112 days after maximum ( hjd 2,446,203 ) .",
    "the light curve fitting of the other two objects are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the left figure represents the total @xmath18 light of the wd photosphere , the irradiated rg , and the irradiated accretion disk . from the light curve",
    "fitting we conclude that the white dwarf mass is as massive as @xmath32 in the same way , the light curve of v3890 sgr is reproduced as shown in the right figure .",
    "the white dwarf mass is estimated as @xmath32 .",
    "seven out of these eight recurrent novae contain a very massive white dwarf close to the chandrasekhar mass limit 1.35 @xmath0 for v2487 oph , v3890 sgr , and v745 sco , 1.37 @xmath0 for t crb , u sco , v394 cra , rs oph ( or more , depending on @xmath33 ) .",
    "moreover , the growth rate of the white dwarf mass is estimated to be @xmath34 ( hachisu & kato 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , they are strong candidates of type ia sn progenitors .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , the acceleration of nova wind in the decay phase is governed by the iron peak in the opacity , that sensitively changes by heavy element content as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the wind mass - loss is weak in population ii novae , because a small iron peak produces only weak acceleration .",
    "thus , a systemic differences are expected between population ii novae and disk novae . a population",
    "ii nova will show a smaller decline rate , a longer duration time and slower wind velocities compared with those of disk nova on the same white dwarf mass ( kato 1999 )    thus , a statistically trend of slow evolution in light curve is expected in population ii novae .",
    "fast novae and recurrent novae observed in lmc , smc , and a globular cluster indicate that the binaries in such a low iron environment have very massive white dwarfs .",
    "recent studies of stellar evolution suggest that low metallicity environment intends to produce massive white dwarfs ( umeda et al 1999 ) .",
