    "although over the past decades significant progress has been made in unraveling the formation process of low - mass stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shu , 1987 ) ) , it is not well understood how massive stars form .",
    "the contraction timescale is short , so that already very early in the formation process massive stars will produce a copious radiation field that may hamper or even reverse the accretion process ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wolfire & cassinelli , 1987 ) ) .",
    "these difficulties have led to the suggestion that stars more massive than @xmath4  m@xmath5 can not form through ( spherical ) accretion alone , but instead form by collisions of intermediate - mass stars ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "alternatively , non - spherical accretion through a disk could solve the `` radiation pressure problem '' ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , the detection and characterization of circumstellar disks around young massive stars is regarded as an essential step in understanding the formation of the most massive stars .",

    "the young massive star produces a strong uv radiation field ionizing its surroundings . at this stage",
    "the object will become detectable at far - infrared and radio wavelengths through the heated dust and recombination of hydrogen in the expanding hyper- or ultra - compact h  ii region ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * churchwell , 2002 ) ) . in the mean time",
    ", the same uv radiation field will impact on the extended circumstellar disk and start to destroy it ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hollenbach et al . 1994 ) ) .",
    "the disk destruction timescale is so short ( @xmath6  yr ) that it becomes an observational challenge to detect and measure any remnants of the formation process of massive stars .",
    "the near - infrared is the only wavelength range where the dust obscuration is reduced and the dust emission is not dominant yet .",
    "this favours the detection of the photospheric and circumstellar emission of the young massive star .",

    "we focus on the spectroscopic properties of the third class ; 20 objects that differ from normal main - sequence ob stars and exhibit features commonly associated with massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "based on the k - band spectra of the massive ysos candidates in our sample we find evidence for the prescence of a circumstellar disk .",

    "the mg  ii emission is likely produced by the excitation through ly@xmath12 fluorescence . like the fe  ii emission , the mg  ii emission lines point to a dense and warm ( several 1000  k ) circumstellar environment . in a few objects hydrogen pfund - lines",

    "modeling efforts have been hampered by the small number of observed @xmath14-lines , or a low resolving power and moderate signal - to - noise .    of our massive yso sample , 15 objects are observed in the `` co setting '' , of which 5 show the co first - overtone bands in emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the bandhead varies from source to source .",
    "the rise of the first bandhead is sharp in the spectrum of 08576nr292 and 11097nr1218 whereas in that of 16164nr3636 and 18006nr766 a blue wing is clearly present .",
    "the expected profile from a spherical stellar wind has a flat - topped shape and can not account for the wing seen in two of the objects . the favored model to explain the blue wing consists of a keplerian disk and/or a disk - wind ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chandler , 1995 ) ) , although the disk model provides the best match .    in @xcite",
    "we explore the possibility that the co bandhead emission arises from a disk in keplerian rotation around the massive star .",
    "synthetic co bandhead spectra are generated using a standard parametric disk model for a range of gas temperatures , column densities , turbulent velocities and disk viewing angles .",
    "the population of the co rotational levels within each vibrational level is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium , with an excitation temperature given by the local vibrational temperature , specific for each bandhead ; a temperature gradient within the line - forming region is neglected .",
    "typical column densities derived from the model fitting are @xmath15  @xmath16 and excitation temperatures are found to be in the range of 17004500  k.    the different observed profiles of the co - bandhead emission can be explained by a difference in inclination angle of the disks .",
    "it turns out that the co is located in the inner disk regions ( within 5 au ) , very close to the central star ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bik & thi , 2004 ) for more details ) . the maximum distance at which the co bandheads are emitted depends on the inclination , which is not a well constrained parameter , but even for a wide range of possible inclinations the hot co molecules are located within a few au from the star .",
    "similar results are found by @xcite who performed an analysis of a number of massive ysos located in giant hii regions .    in the absence of extinction by dust grains",
    ", the co molecules should be photodissociated by the stellar ultraviolet photons .",
    "however , the derived column densities ( 10@xmath17  10@xmath18 @xmath16 ) are well above the required value for the co molecules to self - shield ( @xmath19(co ) @xmath20@xmath16 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van dishoeck & black , 1988 ) ) .",
    "moreover , gas phase chemical models show that co molecules can rapidly form in the gas phase to compensate for their destruction ( ( * ? ?",
    "* thi & bik , 2005 ) ) .",
    "the different emission lines discussed above require different physical conditions to be emitted .",
    "the co first - overtone emission requires the material to be neutral , dense and a temperature of a few thousand k. on the other hand , the hydrogen emission requires ionized material and to emit the pfund lines a high electron density is required ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this means that the different lines are formed at different locations in the circumstellar environment .",
    "the pfund lines are much broader than br@xmath9 .",
    "if the pf - lines would originate in a keplerian rotating disk , they are likely formed in the high - density inner disk region , while br@xmath9  would be formed over a more extended region of the disk .",
    "this would explain the difference between the width pf - lines and br@xmath9 .",
    "br@xmath9  will be dominated by the more slowly rotating outer parts of the disk ( larger surface area ) and will have a smaller fwhm .",
    "another possibility is that br@xmath9  is formed in a disk wind .",
    "the fwhm of the br@xmath9  lines does not correlate with the width of the co lines of which modeling shows that these lines are formed in a circumstellar disk .",
    "the fwhm of the br@xmath9  lines for the objects with the steep co bandheads is similar to those of the objects where the co bandheads are broad . in the disk wind scenario",
    "the outflow velocity is higher than the rotation velocity and widths of @xmath22 km  s@xmath10are expected for lines formed in a disk wind ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* drew , 1998 ) ) ; no correlation between the fwhm of br@xmath9  and disk inclination is expected .",
    "we have presented several arguments that the emission - line objects contained in our sample are surrounded by a dense , circumstellar disk in keplerian rotation : broad and sometimes double - peaked hydrogen emission lines , mg  ii emission , co first - overtone band emission likely arising from a keplerian disk and a strong near - infrared excess . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] gives a schematic view of the disk geometry and the proposed locations of the different line forming regions .",
    "after correction of the interstellar extinction , the location of the massive yso in the ( j - k ) vs k color - magnitude diagram suggests that they are of early spectraltype .",
    "the majority of the objects have photometric properties similar to the herbig be stars , suggesting that those objects are likely b - type stars .",
    "@xcite were able to detect the i - band spectrum of some of the massive ysos in m17 resulting in a b - star classification .",
    "they found that the o stars in m17 do not show evidence for circumstellar disks .",
    "this is confirmed by observations of massive stars in giant h  ii regions by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blum  ( 1999 ) , @xcite , @xcite ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figuerdo et al ( 2002 ) , @xcite ) . in our sample",
    "only a few objects show evidence that the central star is of o spectral type",
    ".    the disks around the objects in our sample might be the remnants of the large accretion disks ( @xmath23  au ) detected in the millimeter around younger high - mass protostars .",
    "although the near - infrared only probes material upto a few au of the star , the disks around the objects in our sample are likely much smaller than those around the high - mass proto stars ( @xmath24 1000 au ) . the fuv radiation and the strong stellar wind of the stars start to rapidly disrupt the inner regions and photo - evaporate the outer regions of the circumstellar disk as soon as it has formed ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hollenbach , 2000 ) ) .",
    "the detection of only a few o stars surrounded by circumstellar matter is consistent with these photo - evaporation and disk destruction models as well .",
    "the disks around o stars are destroyed much more rapidly than those around b stars .",
    "this suggests that the few objects for which the central star is likely an o star are the youngest objects in our sample ( few 100,000 years ) ."
