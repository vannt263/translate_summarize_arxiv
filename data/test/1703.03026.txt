    "interstellar medium is turbulent with magnetic fields playing a critical role in the key processes , including star formation , propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays as well as regulating heat and mass transfer between different phases .",
    "therefore it is essential to have a reliable way of studying magnetic fields .",
    "unfortunately , there only a few ways of tracing magnetic fields and their applicability is limited .",
    "for instance , tracing magnetic fields with aligned grains ( see @xcite ) requires either the availability of the background stars , if the polarization via extinction is employed , or sensitive far infrared measurements , which frequently imply the use of the space - based instruments .",
    "another major technique that employs synchrotron polarization mostly traces magnetic fields in the warm and hot phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( see @xcite for the list of the idealised ism phases ) .    using spectroscopic data for tracing magnetic fields",
    "was first suggested and demonstrated in @xcite using the anisotropy of correlation functions of the velocity channel maps .",
    "the new approach was motivated by the theoretical advancements establishing that the mhd turbulence is anisotropic ( @xcite , herafter gs95 , @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) and should translate into the anisotropy of the observed correlation fluctuations .",
    "later this approach was employed with the use of velocity centroids @xcite and @xcite and the principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite of the spectroscopic data . in its pca incarnation",
    "the idea of tracing magnetic field anisotropies was applied to the observational data in @xcite with the results of anisotropies shown to be consistent with the starlight polarization measurements .",
    "further development of the technique resulted in the development of techniques using the anisotropies for obtaining the media magnetization , as it parameterized by the alfven mach number @xcite and the separation of compressible and incompressible turbulence components of observational data as discussed in @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the aforementioned improved understanding of the nature of mhd cascade a new technique employing velocity centroid gradients ( vcgs ) was introduced in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth gl17 ) . instead of appealing to anisotropic velocity correlations as in @xcite the new technique made use of velocity gradients that , according to the mhd turbulence theory tend to be perpendicular to the _ local _ direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this idea was further extended in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth yl17 ) where a robust practical procedure for vcg calculations was suggested . in the latter paper",
    "we also applied the new technique to the galfa 21 cm data and demonstrated a good correspondence between the magnetic field tracing with the vcgs and the planck polarization arising from aligned grains .",
    "this result motivates the further study of vcgs properties that we undertake in this paper .",
    "we note parenthetically that vcgs are not the only way to trace magnetic field using velocity gradients .",
    "intensity gradients within the position - position- velocity ( ppv ) channel maps have been recently suggested as an alternative way of exploring the magnetic field topology @xcite . on the basis of the earlier studies of the statistics of channel maps versus the statistics obtained with velocity centroids ( see @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) one can expect that the velocity channel gradients in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth ly17 ) may have advantages for studying supersonic turbulence as well as tracing the 3d distribution of turbulence . at the same time",
    ", the vcgs may have advantages for studying subsonic turbulence .",
    "the comparison of the two technique will be done elsewhere .",
    "another way of exploring the gradients was introduced in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth lylc17 ) .",
    "this approach employs synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) and provides a way of tracing magnetic field in turbulent environments the synergy of which to the vcg technique we explore in this paper . the theoretical basis for the sigs is the same as for the vcgs",
    "however , in the presence of gravity , the response of the sigs and the vcgs is different which provides a way to identify the regions where the matter is subject to the gravitational collapse , as we discuss in the paper .",
    "the density statistics is also affected by mhd turbulence .",
    "mhd turbulence can imprint some of its properties to density , making its statistics at low sonic mach numbers anisotropic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while both from theory and simulations we expect the density to be a worse tracer of magnetic fields , especially at high sonic mach numbers , the very differences between the velocity and anisotropies can be informative of the properties of the turbulent media .",
    "this is the synergy that we also explore in this paper .",
    "we note that the first report of the correlation of the magnetic fields and density gradients was done within the numerical study by @xcite reported the alignment of density gradients and magnetic fields with simulation as well as the change of the alignment that occurs after the effects of self - gravity get important starting with a particular density threshold . in our study",
    "we make a step further and explore the point - wise tracing of magnetic fields by the intensity gradients ( igs ) as well as the nature of the deviations of the igs directions from those of magnetic field .",
    "we show a significant synergy of using the igs , the vcgs and the dust polarimetry data .",
    "in addition , we provide a detailed study on how self - gravity lead to the rotation of both vcg and ig vectors and the physics behind it .",
    "we also explore the ways of improving the ig tracing of magnetic field by suggesting the procedure filtering for the shocked gas regions .    as a separate but related development",
    "it is important to mention the study in @xcite .",
    "there a good correlation of directions of the filaments observed in the ppv galfa channel maps and the magnetic field direction as revealed by planck polarimetry was reported . as a result",
    "the filaments were identified as a tracer of magnetic field direction in hi high latitude gas . while in the original study the filaments",
    "were identified with the actual spacial density enhancements , we believe that the interpretation depends on the thickness of the velocity channel used .",
    "indeed , according to @xcite within the sufficiently thin velocity channels the intensity fluctuations are caustics mostly induced by velocity fluctuations .",
    "therefore , depending on the velocity channel thickness , the filament tracing is related either to revealing of velocity statistics or density statistics or both .",
    "the comparison of the empirical techniques is an interesting problem that we will discuss in another paper .",
    "self - gravity is expected to modify the properties of the flow in the vicinity centers of the gravitational collapse .",
    "the change of the properties of mhd turbulence within such regions is expected to be the result of vcgs changing their properties , in particular their alignment with the magnetic fields .",
    "the density distribution is even more affected by self - gravity .",
    "indeed , a recent study by @xcite , reported that the igs rotate with respect to magnetic fields when arriving some density threshold in super - alfvenic high density self - gravitating simulation . while the work from @xcite does not address how self - gravity dynamically change the alignment of igs and vcgs , that encourages a detailed study on how self - gravity can possibly lead to the rotation of gradient vectors and the physics behind it . in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of how vcgs and igs behave in the regions of self - dominant gravity for the case of sub- and trans - alfvenic clouds , how does the stage of collapse correlated to the alignment of gradients , and how can the aforementioned phenomenon can be used on tracking self - gravitating regions in observation .    in what follows we",
    "briefly summarize the theoretical arguments that justify the use of the vcgs in ",
    "[ sec:1 ] , explain our simulation setting in  [ sec:1.5 ] and numerical approach for gradient calculation in",
    " [ sec:2 ] .",
    "we provide a comparison of the alignment of vcgs and igs with magnetic fields in different physical conditions in ",
    "[ sec:3 ] , and providing methods on improving the alignment .",
    "we explore the properties of the vcgs in sub - alfvenic self - gravitating clouds in  [ sec:4 ] and explore their synergistic use with the igs .",
    "we illustrate our method in  [ sec:5 ] using observational data in  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we compare our methods to the method of anisotropy of correlation in  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "we compare our method to others and discuss our results in  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec:8 ] .",
    "the theoretical motivation for studying magnetic fields using vcgs are discussed in our earlier papers ( gl17 , yl17 , ly17 ) as well as in the paper on the sigs ( lylc17 ) . in short , in the presence of fast turbulent reconnection @xcite the motions that do not induce magnetic field bending are preferentially excited .",
    "these are the motions perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field .",
    "this fact is numerically confirmed in @xcite and is the corner stone of the modern theory of mhd turbulence ( see @xcite ) . due to this alignment of velocity motions ,",
    "the gradient of velocities are largest perpendicular to the _ local _ direction of magnetic field .",
    "it is important that the gradient amplitude for the gs95 turbulence is increasing with the decrease of the eddy scale .",
    "therefore the smallest eddies that are most aligned with the local direction of the magnetic field contribute most to the gradients . as a result , by tracing the velocity gradients one can trace the magnetic field direction .",
    "the motions at the turbulence injection scale can be super - alfvenic , i.e. faster than the alfven velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the gs95 theory is not applicable to such motions .",
    "however , as the turbulent velocity decrease with the scale , e.g. for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath1 , for a realistically extended turbulence inertial range at small scales the motions gets subalfvenic and obey the gs95 theory .",
    "therefore , by filtering the contributions from larger scales we may still trace the magnetic fields using velocity gradients .    in the presence of gravity , the velocity field is modified .",
    "in particular , for subcritical collapse when magnetic field dominate the dynamics , the motions are expected along the stiff magnetic field lines , making velocity gradients aligned with magnetic field . similarly , for supercritical collapse , the collapsing material is expected to drag relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "this should also make magnetic fields and velocity gradients aligned . in other words , for the regions with significant self - gravity effects we expect the change of the direction of magnetic field and velocity gradient alignment from being perpendicular to magnetic field to becoming parallel to magnetic field .",
    "( see section [ subsec:4.1 ] for a detailed discussion )    in gl17 and yl17 the velocity centroids were used as a measure of velocity that is available from observations .",
    "the velocity centroids were shown to reflect the statistics of underlying velocity field well , at least for subsonic mhd turbulence @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we explore numerically the utility for the vcgs to trace magnetic fields in mhd turbulence for various turbulent driving environments , e.g. different combination of sonic and alfvenic mach number , different compression of fluids in non self - gravitating as well as self - gravitating environment .",
    "we shall also establish the guidelines on how to get better alignments numerically even the gradient technique does not provide a good prediction .",
    "as there are many factors affecting the alignment of rotated gradients with magnetic fields , we would investigate vcgs and igs through studying mhd simulations in different physical conditions .",
    "following yl17 and lylc17 we used a series of compressible , turbulent , isothermal single fluid magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations for examination of vcgs and igs from zeus - mp/3d @xcite , a variant of the code zeus - mp @xcite .",
    "we set up simulation cubes with several combinations of sonic mach number @xmath2 and alfvenic mach number @xmath3 , which are listed in table [ tab : simualtionparameters ] . for supersonic simulations",
    ", we increases the resolution of the simulations to ensure the cube has a sufficiently long inertial range for high @xmath2 cases .",
    "the initial magnetic field is along the z - axis and the boundary condition is triply periodic .",
    "we injected turbulence using the same method in yl17 .",
    "to study the effect of compressibility to alignment of gradients , we also introduce a cube ( set e ) from an incompressible simulation ( see lylc17 for details ) .",
    "most of this work is devoted to the studies of diffuse media with the negligible effects of gravity . in section[sec:4 ]",
    "we study the case of strongly magnetized media for which self - gravity is important .",
    "there we wait until turbulence inside the cube gets saturated and then switch on the self - gravitating module , which employs a periodic fast fourier transform ( fft ) poisson solver . to trace the effect of gravity with respect to time ,",
    "we take a number of snapshots with even time intervals before and after the of gravity is switch on .",
    "we stop our calculation when any pixel in the system violates the truelove criterion @xcite , which informs us when to stop the simulation before having numerical artifacts due to self - gravitating collapse . as self - gravity",
    "is a dynamic process , we expect systems having same @xmath2 and @xmath3 but different magnetic criticality , that means a system with gravitational to magnetic energy ratio larger than one , will provide very similar final results .",
    "therefore we here only investigate the systems with magnetic criticality @xmath4 to be 2 , which ensures the cube will have physical collapse when self - gravity is activated and before the truelove criterion is violated .",
    "the raw data from simulation cube has to be converted to synthetic maps for our gradient studies . assuming the line - of - sight direction is the @xmath5-axis , the intensity @xmath6 , velocity centroid @xmath7 are defined as @xmath8    we also computed polarization by assuming the media is optically thin , faraday rotation is not effective along the line of sight , and the emissitivity is a constant over the line of sight . in other words , the stokes parameters @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of @xmath10 , the y and z direction magnetic fields : @xmath11 the polarized intensity @xmath12 and angle @xmath13 are then defined correspondingly .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the three observables @xmath14 will be used to calculate the intensity gradients ( igs ) , velocity centroid gradients ( vcgs ) and synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) , by following the recipe and the _ sub - block averaging_. the _ sub - block averaging _ method , as it introduced in yl17 is based on defining the most probable direction within a block by a local gaussian - fitting peak on the distribution of gradient angle distribution . within the approach , the fitting error provides a quantitative estimate of whether the block size is large enough for providing a correct direction .",
    "to compare the performance between vcgs and igs , we employed the _ alignment measure _ that is introduced in analogy with the grain alignment studies ( see @xcite ) : @xmath15 ( see gl17 , yl17 ) with a range of @xmath16 $ ] to measure the relative alignment between _ rotated _ gradients and magnetic fields , where @xmath17 is the relative angle between _ rotated _ gradients to magnetic field .",
    "a perfect alignment gives @xmath18 . on the other hand , @xmath19 when vectors tend to be more perpendicular .",
    "we shall use am to quantify the performance of the vcgs and igs in various physical conditions .",
    "some special values for am can also give the readers how good the alignment it is for certain type of gradient vectors to magnetic fields .",
    "for example , @xmath20 indicates the dispersion between _ average _ gradients to magnetic field directions is about @xmath21 , which means the gradient vectors are rather good tracers for the magnetic field direction . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath22 indicates a random orientation of gradient vectors relative to magnetic fields . in what follows",
    ", we shall study both vcgs and igs and investigate their advantages and synergy for studying magnetic field and other parameters of the ism .",
    "shocks are a very important process when the sonic mach number , @xmath2 , which is the ratio of the turbulent injection velocity and the speed of sound , gets large .",
    "different phases of the ism are expected to have different sonic mach numbers @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the mach number @xmath2 of warm gas is of the order of unity ( see @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) , while the mach number of cold interstellar media ( see @xcite ) as well as molecular clouds can be @xmath23 and even higher .",
    "the sonic mach number also characterize the compressibility of turbulent flow .",
    "when @xmath2 increases , stronger compressions result in stronger shocks and significantly modify the properties of turbulent gas .",
    "we study how shocks change the alignment of gradient vectors and the underlying magnetic field .",
    "we start our investigation with the cubes from set `` b '' ( see table [ tab : simulationparameters ] ) to perform an alignment test on both the vcgs and the igs .",
    "figure [ fig : vcgig - ms ] shows how the vcgs and the igs behave with various @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the alignment of the vcgs in significantly better compared with the igs .     a diagram showing the alignment of vcgs ( red ) , igs ( green ) , and the relative alignment between them ( blue ) as the sonic mach number @xmath2 increases , scaledwidth=44.0% ]    [ tab : simualtionparameters ]    .simulations used in our current work .",
    "the magnetic criticality @xmath24 is set to be 2 for all simulation data . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a subsequent study on observational studies on the same vela c region ( yuen et al . in prep ) , we not only be able to trace the direction of magnetic field in appropriate scales with very high @xmath25 , but also locating the possible self - gravitating region using the numerical result in this work .",
    "that suggests the applicability of our technique for magnetic field tracing even within extreme environments .      in this work ,",
    "we investigate a number of different regimes for the sonic mach number @xmath2 , but the explored range of the alfven mach numbers @xmath3 is limited to sub- and trans - alfvenic cases only . while our series of studies ( yl17 , lylc17 , this work , @xcite ) shows the power of our gradient technique in different circumstances , one very important regime that is yet to explore is the highly super - alfvenic cases .",
    "on the other hand , the expectation from turbulence theory ( gs95 , lv99 ) also make the tracing through gradients more complicated than sub- and trans - alfvenic cases",
    ". only sufficient small scales @xmath26 will the turbulent eddies become anisotropic .",
    "in fact , the wavenumber removal suggested in section [ subsec:3.2 ] should be able to reveal the alignment of the vcgs to underlying magnetic field provided that @xmath27 is known .",
    "the practical procedures for the actual data handling will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "our paper explores the use of the velocity centroid gradients ( vcgs ) for tracing magnetic fields and its synergy with other gradient techniques and polarimetry for probing the ism processes .",
    "we tested how vcgs , intensity gradients ( igs ) and synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) behave under different physical conditions , including a change of sonic and alfvenic mach numbers and in the presence of self - gravity .",
    "we show that in the diffuse media the vcgs trace the magnetic field well and showed that in combination with polarimetry they can also be efficient in identifying the regions dominated by self - gravity .",
    "our results in the paper can be briefly summarized :    1 .   in the diffuse media",
    "the vcgs trace the magnetic field well and in combination with polarimetry or sigs they can also be efficient in identifying the regions dominated by self - gravity .",
    "2 .   the deviations of the direction of the vcgs and the igs can signify the existence of shocks and can be used as a ways to obtain the turbulence sonic mach number .",
    "3 .   new ways to improve the performance of the vcgs and igs tracing magnetic fields were identified .",
    "they include 1 .   removing pixels with higher ig amplitudes .",
    "2 .   removing the contribution of lower wave number .",
    "4 .   for self - gravitating regions the alignment of the vcgs changes : 1 .   in the case of dynamically important magnetic field ,",
    "the unconstrained falling of matter along magnetic fields lines makes the gradients aligned with magnetic fields",
    ". therefore the change of the relative orientation of polarization directions and those determined by the vcgs can provide the observational signature of the self - gravitating collapse within molecular clouds .",
    "the time scale for the response of the igs to the gravity is faster than the vcgs in a collapsing cloud , which shed the possibility of determining the stage of collapse by tracing the relative alignment of the igs to the vcgs in the vicinity of high density regions .",
    "this opens a way to identify the regions of gravitational collapse by observing the increase of misalignment of the igs and the vcgs for intermediate densities with the return to their alignment for higher densities .",
    "3 .   combining vcgs and sigs explored earlier in @xcite , it is possible to locate self - gravitating regions by examining the relative orientation of the two gradients .",
    "the gravity , rather than the density threshold determine the change of the direction of gradient vectors in self - gravitating regions .",
    "the vcgs can provide more detailed magnetic field tracing compared to the correlation function anisotropy technique as suggested in lazarian et al .",
    "we illustrate our technique by analyzing the observation data : 1 .",
    "for the nearby region of galfa - hi used in @xcite to the combination of the vcgs and the igs reveals shocks .",
