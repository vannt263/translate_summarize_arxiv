    "the discovery in 1998 from observations of type ia supernovae @xcite that the universal expansion is currently accelerating was a spectacular result .",
    "the finding has since been confirmed by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite    one possible explanation is that the energy density of the universe is dominated by dark energy with a negative equation of state .",
    "the simplest possibility is the cosmological constant which has @xmath2 with @xmath3 at all times .",
    "however , since the cosmological constant has a magnitude completely different from theoretical expectations one is naturally led to consider other explanations for the dark energy .    a light scalar field",
    "rolling in a very flat potential would for instance have a strongly negative equation of state , and would in the limit of a completely flat potential lead to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "such models are generically known as quintessence models .",
    "the scalar field is usually assumed to be minimally coupled to matter , but very interesting effects can occur if this assumption is relaxed ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in general such models",
    "would also require fine tuning in order to achieve @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the dark energy and matter densities at present .",
    "however , by coupling quintessence to matter and radiation it is possible to achieve a tracking behavior of the scalar field so that @xmath4 comes out naturally of the evolution equation for the scalar field .",
    "many other possibilities have been considered , like @xmath7-essence , which is essentially a scalar field with a non - standard kinetic term .",
    "it is also possible , although not without problems , to construct models which have @xmath8 , the so - called phantom energy models .    finally , there are even more exotic models where the cosmological acceleration is not provided by dark energy , but rather by a modification of the friedman equation due to modifications of gravity on large scales @xcite .",
    "if dark energy is a fluid , i.e.  a component with energy density and pressure , it can in general be characterized by one parameter in addition to the equation of state , @xmath9 , namely the speed of sound , @xmath1 .",
    "scalar field models with standard kinetic terms all have @xmath10 which is a solid prediction . on the other hand",
    ", models such as @xmath7-essence can have an effective sound speed which at times is @xmath11 ( note that this in fact does not violate causality ) .",
    "models where the acceleration is due to a modification of gravity have no definable sound speed , and the `` dark energy '' component does not have perturbations . measuring the effective sound speed of dark energy would therefore provide crucial information which is complementary to the measurement of the equation of state .",
    "note that another possibility is to discuss the dark energy parameters purely in terms of observables instead .",
    "this approach was for instance adobted in the recent paper @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss current constraints on the sound speed of dark energy as well as the prospects for a future detection of this parameter . in section",
    "ii we review the formalism needed to describe perturbation evolution of a general fluid with equation of state and sound speed . in section iii",
    "we review the main observational probes of dark energy , and in section iv we discuss the current constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section",
    "v we discuss possible future constraints on the sound speed from observations of the cmb , large scale structure , and weak lensing . finally , section vi contains a discussion of the results .",
    "the standard treatment of cosmological perturbation theory is the now classical paper by ma and bertschinger @xcite , which described perturbation equations for general fluids in both synchronous and conformal gauge .",
    "the most commonly used numerical boltzmann solver is cmbfast @xcite which uses synchronous gauge throughout .",
    "for that reason we follow the notation of @xcite , but only derive the perturbation equations in synchronous gauge because we use a modified version of cmbfast for all numerical computations . in this gauge the perturbation equations for a general , imperfect fluid have been derived several times in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) . here",
    "we simply review the equations as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the adiabatic speed of sound for any fluid is given by @xmath12 however , for an imperfect fluid the speed of sound is given by the more general relation @xmath13 if @xmath14 , entropy perturbations will develop , determined by @xmath15 while many components in themselves behave as perfect fluids ( dust , radiation , etc ) , the combination of two perfect fluids with different speeds of sound can produce an imperfect fluid in which @xmath14 .    many models of dark energy can also be described as imperfect fluids . for example",
    "a single scalar field model always has @xmath16 , while @xmath17 can be very different .    in synchronous gauge",
    "the density and velocity perturbations take a particularly simple form @xcite    @xmath18 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\dot \\theta & = & -h(1 - 3 c_s^2 ) \\theta + \\frac{c_s^2}{1+w } \\delta - k^2 \\sigma , \\label{eq : pert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the anisotropic stress .",
    "this term arises from the next order in the boltzmann hierarchy . in most cases this term",
    "can be neglected , and the boltzmann equation can be truncated to form a closed system of equations , similar to how the enskog expansion is performed @xcite .",
    "these equations are then straightforward to solve , provided that we know @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "it should be noted that the above equations are valid even for time - varying @xmath0 .",
    "however , our approach will now be to take @xmath0 to be constant , as has been done in many previous analyses @xcite . at present",
    "there is no indication that @xmath0 is varying .",
    "even though the present type ia supernova data seem to favour a rapid evolution of @xmath0 , this indication vanishes if all available cosmological data is analysed @xcite ( for other discussions of a time - varying @xmath0 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is also taken to be a constant in our analysis .",
    "although it is possible to produce models with extremely rapidly varying speed of sound , such as some @xmath7-essence models , as it will turn out the present constraints on @xmath20 are so weak that adding parameters to describe a time variation of @xmath20 is not justified at present .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the analysis can be carried to @xmath8 without any problems , as long as @xmath0 is constant and @xmath21 . in that case",
    "there are no singularities in the perturbation equations and they can be solved without any problems .",
    "we therefore also include this region in the likelihood analysis in the next section .    from the perturbation equations it is clear that for @xmath3 there can be no evolution of perturbations in the dark energy since @xmath22 at all times ( for the possibility of initial dark energy perturbations , see for instance @xcite ) .    furthermore , if @xmath0 is sufficiently negative , dark energy only dominates at @xmath23",
    "this means that the speed of sound can only affect the very largest observable scales for these models .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "since thomson scattering polarizes light , there are also power spectra coming from the polarization .",
    "the polarization can be divided into a curl - free @xmath25 and a curl @xmath26 component , yielding four independent power spectra : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the @xmath30-@xmath31 cross - correlation @xmath32 .",
    "the speed of sound of dark energy mainly affects the cmb spectrum at the very largest scales via the late integrated sachs wolfe effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] we show cmb spectra for several different models . from the figure it is evident that there can only be significant changes when @xmath0 is close to 0 .",
    "it should also be noted that when there are no dark energy perturbations ( as in the case where the acceleration is caused by modified gravity or other non - fluid like effects ) the cmb spectrum in general is different . from the perturbation equations it is clear that there is no simple solution where @xmath33 at all times unless @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is that , independent of @xmath20 , any fluid is affected by the metric term @xmath34 . in principle",
    "it will therefore be possible to distinguish any model in which the dark matter behaves as a fluid from models where there are no dark energy perturbations .",
    "however as @xmath0 approaches -1 the difference vanishes .",
    "= 9truecm      any large scale structure survey measures the correlation function between galaxies . in the linear regime where fluctuations are gaussian the fluctuations can be described by the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum alone , @xmath35 .",
    "in general the the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum is related to the matter power spectrum via a bias parameter , @xmath36 . in the linear regime ,",
    "the bias parameter is approximately constant , so up to a normalization constant @xmath37 does measure the matter power spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lss ] we show matter power spectra for several different models .",
    "again , the differences are negligible as soon as @xmath0 approaches @xmath38 .",
    "= 9truecm      at present there are no large scale weak lensing surveys",
    ". however , in the future weak lensing will be one of the main probes of cosmology .",
    "the advantage of measuring weak lensing is that it measures evolution at late times where dark energy contributes significantly to the energy density . in a flat universe",
    "the angular convergence power spectrum of weak lensing is , in the normally used limber approximation , given by @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the present hubble parameter , @xmath6 is the matter density , @xmath41 is the multipole moment , and @xmath42 is the radial distance .",
    "@xmath43 is the non - linear matter power spectrum at wave number @xmath44 and redshift corresponding to a horizon distance of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath45 is the lensing probability function @xmath46 @xmath47 is the distribution function of sources , normalised to @xmath48 .",
    "since sources exist at a distribution of redshifts which are measurable , it is even possible to divide them into redshift bins and do dark energy tomography .",
    "the cmb itself can also be used as a source in which case @xmath49 can be taken as a delta function with @xmath50 .",
    "we have calculated lensing spectra for the same models as before , assuming that all sources are located at @xmath51 .",
    "the non - linear power spectrum was calculated using the peacock - dodds formalism .",
    "this approach is semi - analytic and may not be accurate enough for real parameter extraction .",
    "however , for calculating differences between models it is appropriate , as discussed in ref .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lensing ] . as before the differences are significant only when @xmath0 is close to zero .",
    "however , as will be discussed in section v , future lensing surveys will improve the sensitivity to the sound speed of dark energy significantly .",
    "= 9truecm      measurements of the cosmological relationship between luminosity distance and redshift in itself has ho sensitivity to the speed of sound of dark energy because it only probes the evolution of the homogeneous background .",
    "however , since these measurements significantly constrain other cosmological parameters they break some of the degeneracies between @xmath1 and other cosmological parameters .",
    "using the presently available precision data we have performed a likelihood analysis for the two dark energy parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as our framework we choose the minimum standard model with 6 parameters : @xmath6 , the matter density , the curvature parameter , @xmath52 , the baryon density , @xmath40 , the hubble parameter , and @xmath53 , the optical depth to reionization . the normalization of both cmb and lss spectra are taken to be free and unrelated parameters .",
    "the priors we use are given in table  [ table : priors ] .",

    "note that this means that the 68% and 95% contours are not necessarily equivalent to the same confidence level for single parameter estimates .",
    "we perform our likelihood analysis using the `` gold '' dataset compiled and described in riess et al @xcite consisting of 157 sniae using a modified version of the snoc package @xcite .      at present",
    "there are two large galaxy surveys of comparable size , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the 2dfgrs ( 2  degree field galaxy redshift survey ) @xcite .",
    "once the sdss is completed in 2005 it will be significantly larger and more accurate than the 2dfgrs . in the present analysis we use data from sdss , but",
    "the results would be almost identical had we used 2df data instead . in the data analysis",
    "we use only data points on scales larger than @xmath63/mpc in order to avoid problems with non - linearity .",
    "the wmap experiment has reported data on @xmath27 and @xmath32 as described in refs .  .",
    "we have performed our likelihood analysis using the prescription given by the wmap collaboration   which includes the correlation between different @xmath64 s .",
    "foreground contamination has already been subtracted from their published data .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the results of thew likelihood analysis for wmap and sdss data only . as is also found in many other analyses of the same data for @xmath0 alone , the data is compatible with @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore there is no constraint on the speed of sound .",
    "note here that the bound in @xmath0 comes from the combination of cmb and lss data .",
    "if only cmb data is used then very high values of @xmath0 are allowed .",
    "this in turn means that as @xmath0 increases the sensitivity to @xmath20 also increases .",
    "this effect was found in the wmap data by bean and dore @xcite , and if only the wmap data is considered there is a tentative indication that @xmath65 .",
    "however , as soon as lss data is added the allowed high @xmath0 region disappears and there are significant constraints only on @xmath0 .",
    "= 7truecm    next , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the same analysis , but only using sni - a data .",
    "these measurements are only sensitive to @xmath0 so likelihood contours are vertical lines .",
    "= 7truecm    finally , in fig .  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the likelihood analysis combining all current constraints .",
    "as can be seen there is again no sensitivity to @xmath20 because the constraint on @xmath0 is so strong that it rules out the region where changes in the speed of sound cause significant effects .",
    "= 7truecm      however , it is also interesting to compare the likelihood analysis where the dark energy is a fluid with well - defined equation of state and speed of sound to one where there are no perturbations in the dark energy . as mentioned before there if no continuous transition between models with any finite @xmath1 and models with no dark energy perturbations because any fluid is subject to evolution in @xmath66 from the metric term @xmath34 in the perturbation equations .",
    "the difference between models with no dark energy perturbations and fluid models is therefore also quite interesting to probe .",
    "the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] show the likelihood analysis with the same data , but without dark energy perturbations . as can be seen the allowed region",
    "is shifted to slightly higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "the best fit @xmath61 is 1626.1 for the model with no dark energy perturbations , whereas it is 1625.5 for the fluid model . considering that the fluid model contains one more fitting parameter",
    ", there is no evidence at present for or against perturbations in the dark energy .",
    "the model with no perturbations has 1516 degrees of freedom , whereas the fluid model has 1515 .",
    "this means that @xmath67 in both cases .",
    "while there are no current constraints on the dark energy speed of sound , measurements will improve significantly in the future .",
    "we have performed a simple fisher matrix error estimation of the performance of future measurements .",
    "the estimate is along the lines of that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but includes future large scale structure surveys .",
    "it is possible to estimate the precision with which the cosmological model parameters can be extracted from a given hypothetical data set .",
    "the starting point for any parameter extraction is the vector of data points , @xmath68 .",
    "this can be in the form of the raw data , or in compressed form , typically the power spectrum ( @xmath64 for cmb and @xmath69 for lss ) .",
    "each data point has contributions from both signal and noise , @xmath70 .",
    "if both signal and noise are gaussian distributed it is possible to build a likelihood function from the measured data which has the following form @xcite @xmath71 x \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is a vector describing the given point in model parameter space and @xmath73 is the data covariance matrix . in the following",
    "we shall always work with data in the form of a set of power spectrum coefficients , @xmath74 , which can be either @xmath64 or @xmath69 .",
    "if the data points are uncorrelated so that the data covariance matrix is diagonal , the likelihood function can be reduced to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a @xmath61-statistics and @xmath77 is the number of power spectrum data points @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood is an unbiased estimator , which means that @xmath78 here @xmath79 indicates the true parameter vector of the underlying cosmological model and @xmath80 is the average estimate of parameters from maximizing the likelihood function .",
    "the likelihood function should thus peak at @xmath81 , and we can expand it to second order around this value .",
    "the first order derivatives are zero , and the expression is thus    @xmath82\\right ) ( \\theta_j-\\theta),\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 indicate elements in the parameter vector @xmath84 .",
    "the second term in the second derivative can be expected to be very small because @xmath85 is in essence just a random measurement error which should average out .",
    "the remaining term is usually referred to as the fisher information matrix @xmath86 the fisher matrix is closely related to the precision with which the parameters , @xmath87 , can be determined .",
    "if all free parameters are to be determined from the data alone without any priors then it follows from the cramer - rao inequality @xcite that @xmath88 for an optimal unbiased estimator , such as the maximum likelihood @xcite .      for purposes of parameter estimation",
    "the most important parameter in galaxy surveys is the effective volume , defined as @xmath89 d^3 r.\\ ] ] in the above equation @xmath90 is the selection function .",
    "the simple interpretation of @xmath91 is that it is the volume available for measuring power at wavenumber @xmath7 .    in the following",
    "we shall assume that the survey is volume limited , meaning that the selection function is constant throughout the survey volume .",
    "if the survey is flux limited the selection function is much more complicated . in the region where @xmath92",
    ", @xmath93 is independent of @xmath7 and equal to the total survey volume .",
    "essentially this means that , with certain restrictions , we can use just one free parameter , @xmath93 , to describe a hypothetical galaxy survey .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contribution to the fisher matrix from such a galaxy survey can be written as @xmath94 where the weight - function is @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the upper limit of the integral should be taken to be @xmath97 , which is the scale where non - linearity starts to be significant . in principle",
    "the lower limit , @xmath98 , should be zero but at large scales the assumption that @xmath92 breaks down .",
    "however , by far the most of the weight in the above integral comes from @xmath7 close to the upper limit . therefore , as long as the @xmath7 where @xmath99 is much smaller than @xmath100 the error from taking @xmath93 _ and _ @xmath101 is quite small .",
    "it should be noted that the above integral expression is quite crude .",
    "however , it offers a very simple way of estimating parameter estimation errors from galaxy surveys .",
    "the error arising from it can be of order a factor 2 , leading to an error in the estimated @xmath102 of order @xmath103 .",
    "instead of @xmath93 we use @xmath104 as the free parameter . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the sdss bright red galaxy ( brg ) survey has an effective volume of roughly @xmath105 , corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "note that the number of independent fourier modes on a given scale , @xmath7 , enclosed within the survey volume is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "therefore it essentially corresponds to the factor @xmath107 for the cmb measurements which measures the number of @xmath108-modes for a given @xmath41 . in that sense",
    "both @xmath93 and @xmath107 are a measure of the lack of ergodicity in the given data set .",
    "for a mock cmb experiment we assume it to be cosmic variance ( as opposed to foreground ) limited up to some maximum @xmath41-value .",
    "this value can , however , be different for temperature and polarization detection .",
    "therefore a given hypothetical experiment can be described by only two free parameters , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for all experiments it will be the case that @xmath111 .    in this picture the map data will be well described by @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the planck data by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "in some sense planck can therefore be regarded as the `` ultimate '' cmb experiment because is measures all of the power spectrum parameter space not dominated by foregrounds .",
    "the contribution to the fisher matrix from such a cmb experiment is then    @xmath116    where @xmath117 .",
    "the covariance matrices are given by @xcite @xmath118 \\\\ { \\rm cov}(c_{l , t},c_{l , e } ) & = & \\frac{2}{(2l+1)}c_{l , te}^2 \\\\ { \\rm cov}(c_{l , t},c_{l , te } ) & = & \\frac{2}{(2l+1)}c_{l , t}c_{l , te } \\\\ { \\rm cov}(c_{l , e},c_{l , te } ) & = & \\frac{2}{(2l+1)}c_{l , e}c_{l , te}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be noted here that this approximation relies on the assumption of @xmath119 sky coverage and no pixel noise up to the maximum @xmath41 .",
    "even though these assumptions are not realised in any real experiment they are sufficiently accurate for estimating the parameter estimation accuracy of a given experiment .",
    "finally , a word of caution on the treatment used here . in the fisher matrix analysis for cmb no window function is used , i.e.  it is assumed that all @xmath64 values are uncorrelated . while this is true for @xmath41 much smaller than the resolution limit for a given experiment , it breaks down close @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , since most of the information on cosmological parameters , including the neutrino mass , comes from high @xmath41 this is a real concern .",
    "however , by choosing @xmath120 conservatively in the fisher matrix analysis this problem of overestimating precision at @xmath41 close to the resolution limit can be minimized .",

    "non - linearity invalidates the assumption of gaussianity inherent in the fisher matrix formalism , and for this reason we do not use data beyond @xmath125 . for a lensing survey of this type the only adjustable parameter is @xmath122 which can at maximum be about 0.65 .      in order to calculate estimated @xmath126 errors on the various cosmological parameters we need to apply the fisher matrix analysis to a specific cosmological model .",
    "we choose as the reference model the generic @xmath127cdm model with the following free parameters : @xmath6 , the matter density , @xmath52 , the baryon density , @xmath40 , the hubble parameter , @xmath58 , the spectral index of the primordial perturbation spectrum , @xmath53 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath59 , the spectrum normalization , @xmath60 , the bias parameter , as well as @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",

    "it was found that there is at present no useful constraint on the speed of sound of such a general fluid component .",
    "the reason is that current observations constrain @xmath0 to be close to @xmath38 where the sound speed of dark energy has a negligible influence on perturbation evolution .",
    "we also compared models in which dark energy behaves as a fluid to models with no dark energy perturbations . here , it was found that the allowed region for @xmath0 is shifted to slightly higher values .",

    "<S> we have studied constraints on the equation of state , @xmath0 , and speed of sound , @xmath1 , of the dark energy from a joint analysis of data from the cosmic microwave background , large scale structure and type - ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we find that current observations have no significant sensitivity to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a slight difference between models in which there are no dark energy perturbations and models in which dark energy behaves as a fluid . assuming that there are no dark energy perturbations shifts the allowed region for @xmath0 to slightly higher values . at present models with and without dark energy perturbations </S>",
