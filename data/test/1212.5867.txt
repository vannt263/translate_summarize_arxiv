    "computational study of heavy fermion materials@xcite is a challenging theoretical problem .",
    "these systems are a subset of intermetallic compounds that have a low  temperature specific heat whose linear term is up to 1000 times larger than the value expected from the free - electron theory .",
    "the heavy fermion behavior has been found in rare earth and actinide metal compounds at very low temperatures ( typically less than 10 k ) in a broad variety of states including metallic , superconducting , insulating and magnetic states@xcite .",
    "the physics of the heavy fermion systems is controlled by the antiferromagnetic interactions of local magnetic moments residing on the rare earth or actinide atoms with the sea of conduction electrons .",
    "the theoretical problem of a localized spin interacting with the conduction electrons is the celebrated kondo problemkondo , abrikosov , suhl , nagaoka , willson , hewson whose solution is one of the outstanding achievements of many - body physics .",
    "it describes how the local spin is compensated as the temperature falls below a characteristic kondo temperature .",
    "something similar occurs in the heavy fermion materials which represents an array of such spins forming a kondo lattice .    in this regime , each f orbital is occupied by a fixed number of electrons , and all types of charge fluctuations are approximately frozen due to a large coulomb repulsion penalty that the system pays when the electron is added / removed from the shell .",
    "therefore the low  energy degrees of freedom are provided by localized spins only and the corresponding model is known as the kondo lattice model ( klm)lacroix , coleman , doniach , caprara , tsunetsugu , lavagna , si , nolting , senthil . the klm effective hamiltonian is obtained by using a second  order perturbation with respect to hybridization@xcite of a more general periodic anderson model ( pam ) @xcitewhere the localized f  electrons can exchange with the conduction electrons bath thus allowing both charge and spin fluctuations to occur .",
    "the introduction of the limit of infinite dimensions and subsequent development of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has allowed to study the properties of both models in a systematic manner@xcite    due to developments in the electronic structure theory for strongly correlated systems based on a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) in its local density approximation ( lda )  and dmft@xcite , studies of real heavy fermion materials have recently appeared in the literatureheld , haule , shim . here",
    "the development of continuous time quantum monte carlo method ( ct  qmc ) for solving corresponding anderson impurity problem has played a central role @xcite .",
    "these calculations are extremely computationally demanding especially for the f elements such as plutonium@xcite where a large number of atomic states needs to be kept in the calculation .",
    "we have recently proposed a simplified approach@xcite where instead of full solution of the anderson impurity model , a corresponding kondo impurity ( or more general coqblin ",
    "schrieffer impurity@xcite ) is studied to explore low  energy physics of heavy fermion materialsmatsumotoprb1,matsumotoprb2 using most recently developed ct ",
    "qmc algorithm for this problem@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "an interesting question arises on how exactly the scaling between anderson and kondo impurity models occurs and whether the low  energy properties of heavy fermion systems such as electronic mass enhancement and associated with it linear specific heat coefficient can be recovered from a restricted solution provided by the conduction electron self ",
    "energies available within the klm .",
    "such scaling behavior has been explored @xcite for the temperature dependent susceptibility of the symmetric anderson model using numerical renormalization group techniques@xcite , where a precise mapping has been found to spin@xmath3 kondo hamiltonian . here",
    "we explore a similar mapping between single  particle functions such as the self ",
    "energy where upon increasing the value of on  site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 , we report a convergence of the conduction electron self  energy extracted from the solution of the pam to the one obtained within klm .",
    "we use ct  qmc method for the corresponding impurity models and the dynamical mean field theory for achieving self  consistent solution of the lattice problem .",
    "we utilize an inverse relationship to extract the f  electron self  energies and monitor how the low  frequency behavior of the aim converges to the klmlimit .",
    "our obtained mapping allows the extraction of the mass renormalization of heavy quasiparticles directly from the solution of the kondo lattice hamiltonian .    as an illustration",
    ", we consider an electronic structure of cerhin@xmath4 where we compute hybridization functions of the f  electrons with conduction bath and evaluate kondo exchange coupling .",
    "we subsequently solve the kondo lattice model with ct  qmc and dmft ,  compute conduction electron self ",
    "energies , and then use the inverse mapping obtained from our analysis of the model hamiltonian to evaluate electronic mass enhancement and specific heat coefficient of this system .",
    "our theoretical results are compared with available experimental data .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the mapping between periodic anderson model and kondo lattice model in the limit of large @xmath5 and provide the results for electronic self  energies , quasiparticle residues and susceptibilities . in section iii , application is presented to evaluate electronic mass enhancement and sommerfeld s coefficient for cerhin@xmath4 .",
    "section iv is the conclusion .",
    "one of the popular models to describe the physics of heavy fermion materials is a periodic anderson model@xcite .",

    "the charge fluctuations become effectively frozen and the ground state wave function has a little weight of configurations with the number of f  electrons different from its average number @xmath21 .",
    "this results in transforming the pam  hamiltonian which eliminates the hybridization term in first order by schrieffer",
    " wolff transformation .",

    "bandwidth @xmath42 is set to 1 which provides the corresponding units .",
    "as we are looking for a mapping between the two models in the regime of large @xmath1 , we first fix the kondo coupling @xmath25 to some predetermined value .",
    "there are typically two phases that emerge in the klm : the antiferromagnetic rkky  phase and the paramagnetic fermi liquid phase , which compete with each other on the scale of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in the fermi liquid behavior and consider the value of @xmath43 in all our calculations .",

    "hole symmetric case of the kondo insulator , the conduction electron self  energies diverge to produce an energy gap in the excitational spectrum .",

    "we write @xmath52and noticing that we target the @xmath48 limit , we replace @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and divide both parts by @xmath1 .",
    "for the imaginary part we obtain the following scaling behavior @xmath55that expresses the large @xmath1 limit of the pam  self  energy via the quantities available within klm .",

    "we see that as @xmath1 increases the pam  self  energy converges to that of the klm .",

    "when @xmath57 the two hubbard bands are within the conduction electron band which has a bandwidth of 2 in our units . in this case the self  energy deviates more than the data for @xmath58 .",

    "we further check the quasiparticle residues that we extract from the low frequency behavior of the self  energies .",
    "these are related to renormalized effective masses for the quasiparticles responsible for the enhanced specific heat coefficient which is one of the central properties of systems with heavy fermions .",
    "qmc algorithm works on an imaginary time axis , which after the fourier transformation gives us the data on the imaginary frequency axis . despite problems associated with numerical noise that prevents us to extract accurate data at real frequencies using analytical continuation ,",

    "while the slave  boson method , a very fast calculation , demonstrates a similar behavior , it overestimates the pam data by about 100% .",
    "since the klm freezes the spatial fluctuations but keeps the essential magnetic properties , the corresponding spin susceptibilities @xmath69 should agree between the pam  and klm at least for low temperatures .",
