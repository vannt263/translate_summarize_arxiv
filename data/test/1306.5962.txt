    "a debate on the existence of non negligible amounts of material in the local interstellar medium has taken place over several decades .",
    "the problem may be looked upon under very different angles but could perhaps be reduced to : is any matter present and if so how much and how is it distributed ? the local medium has observational as well as theoretical attractions .",
    "the distribution of the cooler , dense material has consequences for the theoretical models as well as for the understanding of the propagation of the energetic radiation .",
    "the concept of the solar vicinity has condensed to be apprehended as a local low density cavity in the ism : the local bubble ( or as a system of interconnected bubbles ) .",
    "a natural question is consequently how big this local bubble or low density cavity is ?    in minor photometric surveys , often for other purposes than lb studies , wall - like structures were sometimes seen : abrupt changes of the color excess over very small distances . @xcite and @xcite are examples showing an onset of reddening at @xmath7100 pc in the general direction of scorpius .",
    "@xcite is a more recent example where @xmath8 data has been used to outline lb .    in order to indicate the size of the lb",
    "some of the parameters characterising it must be known .",
    "the confinement of the bubble is encountered when one or more of these parameters are changed in a significant way .",
    "such a parameter could be @xmath9 or the average line of sight reddening / extinction , @xcite , @xcite . for the size abt quotes the range 50 - 100 pc and frisch , redfield and slavin present in the their fig .  4 a sky map for stars between 50 and 100 pc displaying a nice coherent contour @xmath10 @xmath7 0.1 mag confining a low density region .",
    "the origin of the color excesses used for this map is , however not given in any detail .",
    "in the cavity the parameters are found in certain defining ranges , typically low density and small extinction .",
    "the location where either of these defining parameters displays a rise could naively indicate the boundary of the lb . @xcite and @xcite used the gradient @xmath11 = 0.0002 mag pc@xmath12 to identify the lb rim .",
    "@xcite used a similar technique on calibrated 2mass data to locate more massive clouds .",
    "stellar extinctions are naturally discrete measures but do have an upper distance limit .",
    "data from hydrogen emission in its various forms are continous but often lack precise distance estimates .",
    "the continuity problem may partly be remedied with large stellar samples .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue with its @xmath7120000 entries is a first approximation to provide continously 3d distributed extinctions .",
    "a large fraction of this sample do have positive precise parallaxes , reasonably decent photometry and spectral / luminosity classification and thus offers itself for a 2d/3d extinction study .",
    "for stars with spectral and luminosity classification it is not a problem to assign the intrinsic color .",
    "intrinsic colors are taken from @xcite .",
    "if schmidt - kalers color system differs from that given in the hipparcos 1 catalogue the difference is ignored .",
    "classification is as given in hipparcos 1 but for the deklination zone covered by the michigan 5 catalogue , @xcite , which was not available for the first publication of the hipparcos catalogue , @xcite , it has been replaced by this more precise one . for stars with a spectral type but no luminosity class we use the @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 = @xmath3 diagram to distinguish between the dwarfs and giants .",
    "the parallax @xmath15 is taken from hipparcos 2 , @xcite .",
    "our first assumption is that any shift of a stars intrinsic position in the @xmath16 @xmath2 @xmath17 diagram is caused solely by reddening / extinction .",
    "we notice that the slope of the main sequence in the color magnitude diagram does not differ that much from the ratio @xmath18 and is nummerically smaller , implying that the rather small reddenings presumed to be present in the hipparcos catalog will not mix the dwarfs and the giants . a dividing curve introduced in the color magnitude diagram",
    "can accordingly be used for the luminosity separation .",
    "subgiants are assumed to have colors identical to the dwarfs with the same spectral type .",
    "the spectral type and the location relative to the dividing curve then provide an estimate of the intrinsic color . since most hipparcos stars have 2mass colors the giant dwarf separation might also result from a diagram as fig .",
    "29 in @xcite .    this way most stars with a positive parallax have estimated reddenings .",
    "the sample may , however , be refined from a comparison to the comments given in the simbad data base .",
    "most of the hipparcos stars do have comments .",
    "we may accordingly sort out variables , stars in multiple systems , pms stars , stars with close companions etc .",
    "there is one important group of nearby stars that singles out : the high proper motion stars , many of which concentrates in a small region between the late main sequence and the giants in the @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 diagram .",
    "they do accordingly not comply to the dividing curve scheme and we have left them all out - which is unfortunate since they all are very close and would be ideally suited for lb studies if their properties were better known .",
    "neither are stars located in clusters included .",
    "our extinction sample consists only of stars having the star assignment in simbad .",
    "the sample is reduced to some 85000 possible , single non - variable stars without close neighbors this way .",
    "@xmath2 @xmath19 diagram for the hipparcos extinction sample with more than 85000 stars not commented as multiple or variable in @xmath20 .",
    "high proper motion stars are not included since a large fraction of them has a strange location in the @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 diagram .",
    "astrometry is from @xcite .",
    "the change in precision with @xmath21 taking place at @xmath19 = 0.35 defines the sample used presently for the study of the local ism , width=332 ]    so far we have not considered the parallax precision . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we have plotted @xmath22 @xmath21 @xmath2 @xmath19 where @xmath21 = 3.1@xmath23 . read from the bottom , where the attractive small errors presumably for nearby stars are located , we notice that the maximum positive extinctions increases with increasing @xmath19 until a change takes place at @xmath70.35 .",
    "we take this dividing value as the upper limit for the relative precision .",
    "in fact no stars beyond @xmath61 kpc has a better precision than this value .",
    "most of the very negative extinctions belong to stars that has a tabular value @xmath13 = 0.000 which obviously is not correct for the assigned spectral type .",
    "we have kept them in the sample though .    a diagram like",
    "@xmath21 @xmath2 @xmath15 will show the general run of extinction and should display the lb wall , if any .",
    "there is in fact such a wall - like feature present in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] where a general rise in the extinction takes place at @xmath15@xmath78 mas or 125 pc . a distance roughly corresponding to the maximum extent , apart from the tunnel directions , in @xcite .",
    "= 0.35 confinement is not applied here .",
    "notice the extinction discontinuity at @xmath24 8 mas ( 125 pc ) roughly corresponding to the canonical `` radius '' of lb , width=332 ]    0.35 .",
    "the location of the far uv shadow clouds , lb165 - 32 , lb27 - 31 and lb329 + 46 at 40 , 45 and 65 pc are indicated by the diamonds , @xcite",
    ". a possible interpretation of this map could be : if the median @xmath25 0.1 mag the lb boundary is less than 55 pc away and if median @xmath26 0.1 mag the boundary is farther away .",
    "grid for every 30 degrees in longitude and for every 15 degrees latitude , width=332 ]",
    "on the average the hipparcos extinction sample of @xmath685.000 stars provide @xmath6two stars per square degree . of course depending on the galactic latitude .",
    "the completeness is hard to assess in a statistical way since the hipparcos input catalog was based on a variety of astrophysical proposals .",
    "since the v magnitude for completeness is between 8 and 9 we do not measure large extinctions as is also evident from fig .",
    "but for our purpose , locating very nearby extinction , completeness for the extinction values is not necessary as long as a variation defining the lb boundary can be detected .",
    "we cover the sky with a grid of overlapping pixels .",
    "pixel size determined by requesting a number of stars per pixel permitting the computation of a median extinction for the distance range under study . in this note fig .",
    "[ f3 ] presents the outcome for stars within 55 pc .",
    "the median @xmath21 values range from @xmath60.05 mag to @xmath60.3 mag and we note a marked difference between the north and south and between the 4 quadrants . this projection may be compared to fig .  4 of @xcite showing @xmath10 contours for stars in the distance range from 50 to 100 pc . the distribution on fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is almost identical but with smaller extinction values - which could be due to the different lenghts of the sight lines : @xmath2755 @xmath2 @xmath27100 pc .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we have also indicated the location of three diffuse clouds causing shadows in the far uv , @xcite . the clouds lb165 - 32 , lb27 - 31 , lb329 + 46 are removed @xmath2740 , 45 and 65 pc respectively , just in the volume we are studying presently . as fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows the clouds are almost superposed on the boundary of the low density contour .",
    "are they then part of the lb confinement ?",
    "in fact they may not be because in @xcite it was found that each of these small clouds was located in front of other clouds at 100 , 135 and 125 pc respectively .",
    "these later distances agree much more to the canonical lb confinement .",
    "recently @xcite , from a very large photometric sample of @xmath723.000 stars with various distance indicators , have presented a @xmath10 map for stars within 100 pc , among many others maps with different distance cuts , with a strong resemblence to fig .",
    "so , is the lb boundary , as indicated by the rise in color excesses / extinctions , real within 100 pc as indicated by the @xmath10 @xmath7 0.1 mag contour , @xcite , but not for stars within 55 pc with an @xmath21 @xmath7 0.1 mag contour corresponding to @xmath10 @xmath7 0.03 mag as the conclusion would be if the three shadow clouds mentioned really are @xmath750 pc in front of the proper lb boundary ?",
    "but if we may rely on the median extinctions and the map in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and accept the median @xmath21 = 0.1 mag as defining the onset of extinction from the lb confinement we could possibly state that in the northern part of the first and second quadrant the lb limit is within 55 pc and in the southern part of the third and fourth quadrant it is further away .",
    "we have constructed what was termed the hipparcos extinction sample with about 85.000 distance extinction pairs .",
    "the classification originally in the hipparcos catalogue was supplemented with the @xmath28 classification of hd stars .",
    "we introduced a simple dwarf / giant separation of the @xmath29 in order to have a 2d classification of the stars with no luminosity class given in the catalog .",
    "our main purpose has been to demonstrate that the hipparcos extinction sample in addition to estimating distances to individual clouds , e.g. @xcite , possibly also may be used to trace large scale features , extending over large fractions of the sky .",
    "it seems justified to conclude that further investigation of the hipparcos extinction sample at larger distances may be worth while .",
    "the investigation of the milky way ism is supported economically by fonden af 29 .",
