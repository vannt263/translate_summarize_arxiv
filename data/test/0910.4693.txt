    "nowadays it is widely accepted by high energy physicists that einstein s theory must represent a low energy limit of a more fundamental ( quantum ) theory of gravity .",
    "this suggests that the transition between both regimes must be ruled by an ultraviolet deformation of gr which , presumably , could solve many of the puzzles present in einstein s theory . in this direction , special interest has been put on 3-dimensional gravity as an attempt to understand many of the conceptual and technical problems associated with the quantization of spacetime in the realistic 4-dimensional scenario @xcite . in this process",
    ", it was suddenly realized that three dimensional einstein gravity has a number of peculiar facts ; it contains no propagating degrees of freedom , and does not reduce to 2-dimensional newtonian gravity in the weak - field limit .",
    "moreover , the spacetime is flat outside matter and hence there exists no static interaction between sources @xcite .",
    "not long after the first investigations in 3-dimensional general relativity have appeared @xcite , several generalizations were proposed in order to make 3-dimensional dynamics more alike the realistic @xmath0-gravity . among the plethora of theories that are not constrained to exist only in 3 dimensions we can mention @xmath1-dilaton gravity @xcite-@xcite , conformal gravity @xcite and the newcomer new massive gravity ( nmg ) @xcite . on the other hand , some constructions that are unique to @xmath2 dimensions have been also considered .",
    "one that has attracted much attention in the last years is the so called topological massive gravity ( tmg ) , which adds to einstein action a chern - simons term free of torsion @xcite ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of solutions ) .",
    "the singularities inherent to einstein theory had been matter of research since the early days of general relativity ( gr ) . thought the concept of singularity encounter its _",
    "raison dtre _ in the geodesic incompleteness @xcite , it historically came into light associated with the divergences of physical quantities . regarding this matter ,",
    "most of the major achievements in the subject have arisen from examination of two fundamental issues : the question of the origin of the universe and the final state occurring in the gravitational collapse of massive stars . in the former issue",
    "( leaving aside ontological discussions about the origin of time ) , physical quantities such as the energy density and pressure of matter fields , become infinite in the big bang . in the latter ,",
    "the unfortunate destiny of the infalling observer who goes beyond the schwarzschild radius , is to experiment infinite tidal forces as he / she approaches @xmath3 , due to the very infiniteness of the riemann curvature tensor at that point .",
    "as is well known , vacuum solutions for 3-dimensional gr are free of curvature singularities , because the einstein tensor is just the double dual of the curvature and so , essentially , it is proportional to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "however , due to non trivial topological properties , the massive circular symmetric solutions of vacuum einstein equations in 3 spacetime dimensions displays a conical singularity at the origin . in the case without cosmological constant , which might be considered the three dimensional analogue of the exterior kerr metric , the solution exhibits closed timelike curves ( ctc ) .",
    "more realistic four dimensional cosmic string solutions inherit all these properties @xcite .    in papers @xcite",
    "we have introduced the so called born - infeld ( bi ) gravity with the aim of smoothing the curvature singularities characterizing the cosmological ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) solutions of @xmath4 gr . in the present work , in turn , we are pursuing a different task by asking whether it is possible to remove the singularities of topological nature existent in vacuum @xmath1 einstein gravity .",
    "it is worth of mention that none of the above referred approaches to gravity in 3 dimensions have supplied a non - singular behavior in its circular symmetric vacuum solutions . for this purpose",
    "we extend the construction presented in the articles @xcite by working with a determinantal form of the action .",
    "this new approach to the subject has the benefit of being in more close correspondence with the original bi construction . for this new scheme",
    "we have found a circular symmetric vacuum solution in three dimensional spacetime without cosmological constant .",
    "we have obtained that the angular momentum @xmath5 not only controls the global properties of the spacetime , but it has an impact on the local physics through the curvature of the manifold . remarkably , the curvature invariants are bounded functions of the radial coordinate .",
    "when the bi parameter @xmath6 tends to infinity , the conical geometry characterizing the elementary solution of einstein s theory in @xmath7 is restored .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that the theory provides a minimum attainable circle whose circumference is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant related with the mass of the spinning source . as a consequence , the spacetime structure becomes geodesically complete because no free falling particles can ever reach this minimum circle in a finite proper time .",
    "another feature of this natural cutoff on the radial coordinate is that , unlike its low energy ( i.e. gr ) version , there are not closed timelike curves in this geometry .",
    "in order to motivate the construction we will work out , let us briefly examine born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "as is well known , this non linear theory for the electromagnetic field was able to tame the infinite self energy of the point - like charged particle . in its first version @xcite ,",
    "bi theory deformed the maxwell lagrangian @xmath10 according to the rule @xmath11.\\ ] ] the scheme ( [ scheme ] ) is not as unnatural as it seems at first glance ; the same technique can be used for going from the classical free particle action to the relativistic one ; in such case , the scale is @xmath12 , which smoothes the particle velocity by preventing its unlimited growing . in the regime where @xmath13 the relativistic physics restore its low energy ( newtonian ) realm .    soon after its advent @xcite-@xcite , born and infeld generalized their construction by considering the generally covariant determinantal action @xmath14 , \\label{acciondetelectro}\\ ] ] which implicitly includes also the pseudo - invariant @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for the absolute value of the determinant ) .",
    "expressions ( [ scheme ] ) and ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) are coincident only in pure electrostatic or magnetostatic situations , or in electrodynamical phenomena concerning plane waves ( where the two field invariants are null ) . in this last case ,",
    "the scale @xmath17 plays not role at all , hence the field configurations are exactly the same than those of maxwell s theory .",
    "bi electrodynamics reduces to maxwell s theory for small amplitudes , both of them having causal propagation and absence of birefringence .",
    "remarkably , after a long exile , bi action came back again to the stage in the context of more modern developments ; the quartic terms implicit in ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) reproduce the effective action of one - loop supersymmetric qed @xcite , and the structure ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) emerge naturally in the low energy limit of string theory as the action governing the electromagnetic field of d - branes @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned remarkable features of the bi program , together with its well known curative properties concerning singularities , invites to search for gravitational analogues with the structure ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) .",
    "this matter has attracted some attention in the past @xcite-@xcite , where several deformations  la born - infeld combining higher order invariants related to the curvature in a riemannian context were tried .",
    "more recently , a thorough analysis of cosmological models by means of dynamical systems techniques was performed in @xcite .",
    "all these constructions , however , lead to troublesome four order field equations for the metric . actually , within these frameworks , exact solutions were never found . in spite of this , the importance of bi - like actions for the gravitational field",
    "was revisited very recently in connection with the problem of quantum gravity @xcite . in a different direction ,",
    "bi - like actions were explored also in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite using the palatini formalism , where metric and connection are taken as independent entities . in this article",
    ", we shall follow a different path by considering a bi deformation in weitzenbck spacetime .",
    "general relativity can be formulated in a spacetime possessing absolute parallelism .",
    "this approach is usually known as teleparallel equivalent of general relativity tegr @xcite , and relies on the existence of a set @xmath18 of @xmath19 one - forms that turn out to be autoparallel for the weitzenbck connection @xmath20 ( @xmath21 makes up the inverse matrix of @xmath22 ) .",
    "this connection is compatible with the metric @xmath23 and curvature free : weitzenbck spacetime is flat though it possesses torsion @xmath24 , which is the agent where the gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded .",
    "the structure of the torsion tensor resembles the one of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath25 and , like maxwell s , teleparallel lagrangian density is quadratic in this tensor .",
    "in fact , tegr action with cosmological constant @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath27where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31the equivalence between gr and the theory ( [ acciongr ] ) comes from the fact that the gr lagrangian -i.e .",
    "the curvature scalar @xmath32 of the levi - civita connection- is @xmath33 _ surface terms_. in this expression , the surface terms encompass all the second derivatives entering the scalar curvature @xmath32 . in fact",
    ", weitzenbck torsion @xmath34 contains just first derivatives of the fields @xmath35 .",
    "this distinctive feature makes weitzenbck torsion a privileged geometric structure to formulate modified theories of gravitation , since it guarantees that any modified lagrangian in this language will assure second order field equations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we followed the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ scheme ] ) by studying the _ deformed _ action @xmath36 , \\label{accionbi0}\\ ] ] which proved to be capable of smoothing the gr cosmological singularity , providing a natural inflationary stage ( without the mediation of an inflaton ) and bounding the dynamics of the hubble parameter .",
    "apart from this cosmological success , the scheme ( [ accionbi0 ] ) was unable to deform the 3-dimensional circular symmetric solutions , in particular the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "this inability is a consequence of the fact that the scalar lagrangian in ( [ accionbi0 ] ) is constant on the btz solution : @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "here we will follow the spirit of ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) , so we shall propose the general n - dimensional bi action in weitzenbck spacetime @xmath38 ,    \\label{acciondet}\\]]where @xmath39 is quadratic in the weitzenbck torsion , and reads @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 being non - dimensional constants .",
    "such a combination ensures the correct gr limit since both terms in @xmath43 have trace proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , we can factor out @xmath45 from expression ( acciondet ) and use the expansion of the determinant , @xmath46where @xmath47and @xmath48 . in our case",

    "the following term @xmath54 is also present in the expansion of action ( accionbi0 ) .",
    "however we get now a new term @xmath55 at the order @xmath56 , so @xmath57 departs from @xmath58 even at the order @xmath56 . whether the action ( [ acciondet ] ) can be regarded as an effective ( low energy )",
    "action for gravity coming from a more fundamental quantum theory is unknown at present , perhaps because the very quantum theory of gravity is yet a tale to be unfolded .",
    "nevertheless , the experience acquired with its electromagnetic analogue suggest that theory ( acciondet ) would constitute a slope worth to be explored .",
    "action ( acciondet ) shows us that the framework ( [ accionbi0 ] ) is , among the whole born - infeld catalogue , just the top of the iceberg .",
    "the use of a lagrangian which is not a mere deformation of the one in action ( acciongr ) opens the possibility of finding a high energy modification for the gr spherically symmetric solutions . in the next section",
    "we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we will investigate the properties of action ( [ acciondet ] ) in the more accessible environment of ( 2 + 1)-gravity .",
    "in particular , let us work under the assumption of spherically ( circular ) symmetric spacetimes , and propose the following driebein written down in standard polar coordinates @xmath59 @xmath60which implies the metric tensor @xmath61as is known , the vacuum solution for the gr ( @xmath62 ) limit is@xmath63which becomes the rotating btz black hole when @xmath64 .",
    "we will try the dreiben ( [ triada ] ) in the dynamical equations coming from the action ( [ acciondet ] ) , for the particular case @xmath65 ( constant @xmath41 will be absorbed in @xmath6 ) . in terms of the natural variables defined as @xmath66the dynamical equations read @xmath67with @xmath68@xmath69 and @xmath5 being two integration constants .",
    "actually @xmath69 can be absorbed in @xmath70 by redefining the variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the coordinate @xmath73 ( without affecting @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) ; so , we will use @xmath76 . equations ( [ equis1])-([zeta1 ] ) are three coupled algebraic equations . in spite of its apparent harmlessness , they are quite hard to solve in its full generality .    in the case",
    "@xmath77 it is not difficult to find an exact solution for the system ( [ equis1])-([zeta1 ] ) .",
    "notice that the gr solution ( undefor ) satisfies the relation @xmath78 , which in turn leads to @xmath79 ( see eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) ) .",
    "if @xmath77 then @xmath17 does not explicitly appear in eq .",
    "( [ zeta1 ] ) .",

    "( [ x =- z])-([x =- z1 ] ) .",
    "thus the flat spacetime is locally recovered ( notice that the constant @xmath9 could be absorbed by redefining @xmath90 ) . from a global viewpoint ,",
    "( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath91 could be regarded as a conical structure : the slices @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are planes where a wedge was cut off and its opposite sides were identified .",
    "the deficit angle is @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is related with the mass @xmath97 of a source at the origin : @xmath98 @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the coordinate @xmath99 is not allowed to reach the value @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ cambios1 ] ) .",
    "however , in tegr this is not a real limitation of coordinate @xmath99 but a consequence of the chosen dreibein .",
    "in fact @xmath99 can be effectively extended up to @xmath100 , as is apparent in eq .",
    "( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "as is well known , tegr theory ( [ acciongr ] ) is invariant under local lorentz transformations of the vielbein ; therefore the geometry ( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath91 could be derived not only from the dreibein ( [ triada ] ) but from the inertial dreibein @xmath101 .",
    "both dreibeins are related by the lorentz transformation @xmath102 which is a boost tangent to the circle @xmath103 with velocity @xmath104 .",
    "so @xmath5 measures the rotation of the dreibein ( [ triada ] ) with respect to the inertial frame .",
    "the boost velocity increases from infinity to reach the maximum value at @xmath105 , i.e. at @xmath3 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cambios1 ] ) ) .",
    "however , as a consequence of the gauge freedom , the geometry ( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath91 is not imprinted with the value of @xmath5 .",
    "thus one can fix the gauge by choosing @xmath106 , which amounts to the choice of the inertial dreibein , so extending the range of @xmath99 from infinity up to zero .    on the contrary ,",
    "the modified teleparallel actions are invariant only under _ global _ lorentz transformations of the vielbein @xcite , which pre - announce a different role of @xmath5 in these theories and a geometrical meaning for the bound @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , whereas a local lorentz transformation of the vielbein adds a divergence term to @xmath108 , which is not physically significant in action ( [ acciongr ] ) , instead such a divergence term does affect the modified actions ( [ accionbi0 ] ) and ( [ acciondet ] ) .",
    "this loss of gauge freedom means that the modified teleparallel theories govern more dynamical variables that tegr does .",
    "thus , the parameters characterizing the lost gauge transformations become integration constants associated with the recovered degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the family of metrics resulting from the solutions is enlarged .",
    "because of this , @xmath5 plays a very different role in modified teleparallelism ; since dreibeins with different values of @xmath5 are not related through global lorentz transformations , then they represent genuine different solutions of the theory .",
    "@xmath5 enters the metric ( [ metcono ] ) to make @xmath70 a function of the radial coordinate , so labeling different ( curved ) solutions .",
    "in fact , according to eqs .",
    "( [ x =- z])-([x =- z1 ] ) , the function @xmath109 is obtained from the cubic equation @xmath110 in the modified theory ( i.e. , for finite values of @xmath6 ) , the flat solution @xmath91 can only be obtained when @xmath106 , otherwise the space is curved .",
    "the integration constant @xmath5 is the source of the curvature . according to eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) , @xmath111 is the squared length scale for such deformation of flat spacetime .",
    "alternatively , the spatial curvature could be regarded as a variable deficit angle ( just perform the coordinate change @xmath112 in ( [ metcono ] ) ) .",
    "summarizing , the modified theory not only contains the gr solution but a family of curved spacetimes parametrized by the integration constant @xmath5 . as we are going to show , the curvature of the solutions with @xmath113 softens the conical singularity by replacing it with an unreachable minimal circle of radius @xmath114 .    among the three solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) , we will keep the one going to @xmath115 when @xmath116 , since it contains both the gr limit and the proper behavior at infinity .",
    "this solution is : @xmath117 if @xmath118 then @xmath119 and the function @xmath70 is defined for @xmath120 ( i.e. , @xmath121 ) ; so hereafter we shall focus in the case with @xmath122 .",
    "we can characterize the geometry ( [ metcono ] ) by computing its curvature invariants : @xmath123 of course , they go to zero for @xmath124 ( or @xmath99 ) going to infinity . in this case , due to the fact that @xmath125 when @xmath126 , the metric ( [ metcono ] ) describes the conical ( locally flat ) gr spacetime .",
    "the invariants ( [ inva1 ] ) also go to zero for @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) .",
    "in fact , according to eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) @xmath70 behaves as @xmath129 for @xmath130 , what implies @xmath131 when @xmath127 .",
    "as was said before , the coordinate change @xmath112 in the metric ( [ metcono ] ) allows to regard this curved geometry as a space of a variable deficit angle ranging from @xmath132 at spatial infinity , to @xmath133 at @xmath134 ( @xmath3 ) . in this last limit ,",
    "since the deficit cover the whole range of the angular variable , the metric describes a cylinder of radius @xmath135 , which is obtained by identifying points in opposite sides of the _ total _ wedge .",
    "thus , the geometry ( [ metcono ] ) is also asymptotically locally flat when @xmath136 .",
    "figure ( [ curvas ] ) depicts the scalar curvature @xmath137 , for @xmath138 and several negative values of the born - infeld parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the minimum curvature is reached at a position @xmath139 that depends only on the combination @xmath140 . in the highly deformed regime",
    "@xmath141 the curvature effects can be felt at positions very distant from the origin . instead , as long as the low energy limit is restored ( @xmath142 ) ,",
    "such effects are confined to small neighborhoods of @xmath143 ( i.e. @xmath3 ) . in the gr limit @xmath144 ( equivalently , @xmath125 )",
    "there are no effect at all , because the manifold becomes flat .     as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath99 , for @xmath138 . following the minimum of the curves from bottom to top",
    ", it is @xmath145 . ]",
    "the lower bound for the radial coordinate means that the space ends at a minimal circle of circumference @xmath146 .",
    "however this boundary requires an infinite proper time to be reached , which implies that the conical singularity is smoothed .",
    "in fact the radial light rays satisfy @xmath147 , so the coordinate time @xmath34 diverges when a light ray approaches the minimal circle ( because @xmath70 diverges ) . on the other hand , since the metric components in eq .",
    "( [ metcono ] ) do not depend on @xmath34 , then @xmath148 is conserved on geodesics .",
    "this means that the proper time @xmath149 of a freely falling particle is proportional to the coordinate time @xmath34 .",
    "since timelike geodesics remain inside the light cones , then a particle needs an infinite proper time to reach the minimal circle . in figure ( [ geomconi ] )",
    "we have schematically depicted the spacetime ( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath92 as embedded in three dimensional euclidean space with coordinates @xmath150 .",
    "the _ funnel_-like structure appearing in the figure comes from the function @xmath151 which is @xmath152 so the euclidean squared interval on that curve is given by @xmath153 . in the asymptotic region",
    "we have @xmath89 and then , @xmath154 becomes constant there ( we set @xmath155 in the figure ) .    ) as embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space . ]",
    "the obtained geometry not only succeeds in smoothing the conical singularity of the gr ( @xmath91 ) solution but avoids another unpleasant feature of einstein theory in @xmath156 that was posed in early works @xcite-@xcite : the existence of closed timelike curves ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where additional physical criteria was discussed in order to avoid ctc ) .",
    "such a undesirable property appears when coordinate @xmath73 is considered continuous instead of @xmath34 .",
    "this condition forces a jump @xmath157 along the circle ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "while a jump of @xmath90 ( deficit angle ) is related with the mass @xmath97 of the solution , a jump of @xmath34 provides the solution with angular momentum .",
    "in fact , by replacing the solution ( [ metcono ] ) whit @xmath91 in ( 2 + 1)-einstein equations it results that the energy - momentum tensor of the source is @xmath159 , @xmath160 ; i.e. , a spinning massive particle is at the origin @xmath100 @xcite . in this spacetime",
    "we can consider the closed curve with constant @xmath161 in the interval ( [ metricareg ] ) under the coordinate change given in ( [ cambios1 ] ) .",
    "it then becomes @xmath162\\ , m^2\\ , d\\theta^2.\\ ] ] for @xmath163 the closed curve in @xmath90 would be time - like .",
    "gr allows this possibility , since @xmath91 and no restrictions appears for the coordinate @xmath99 . in the determinantal theory , instead , @xmath99 is constrained to be greater than @xmath164 , so excluding ctc .",
    "the same mechanism responsible for the taming of the conical singularity at the origin seems to provide a natural chronological protection .",
    "born - infeld determinantal action ( [ acciondet ] ) could be seen as a natural ultraviolet deformation of einstein gravity which operates at scales of order @xmath165 . for the theory ( [ accionbi0 ] ) , which could be considered the simplest structure among the bi program , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this scale plays an important role in @xmath19-dimensional cosmological scenarios , because it works as an effective initial vacuum energy driving the inflationary stage",
    ". moreover , the invariants are bounded by the bi parameter @xmath6 , ruling in this way not only the behavior of the inflationary phase , but also establishing a maximum attainable spacetime curvature , with its subsequent singularity avoidance .",
    "in the present context we witness a similar behavior ; while action ( [ accionbi0 ] ) was unable of deforming three dimensional vacuum solutions , its extension ( [ acciondet ] ) contains non constant curvature states in empty space .",
    "the example considered here , the one given by metric ( [ metricareg ] ) , is particularly interesting because it represents a circular symmetric spacetime with bounded curvature invariants and @xmath166 , i.e. , without cosmological constant .",
    "the relevant parameter in the deformation is @xmath167 , so extremely high energy regimes leads to strongly rotating systems ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the asymptotic spacetime is the conical geometry ( [ metcono ] ) with @xmath91 typical of three dimensional gr solutions without cosmological constant .",
    "however , while the gr solution has @xmath91 @xmath169 , the determinantal action leads to the behavior ( [ zetarara ] ) for the function @xmath70 . in this way",
    "the singularity is removed and replaced with an unreachable asymptotic minimal circle .",
    "both asymptotic regions are flat , but the space between them is curved .",
    "so , unlike gr , the angular momentum not only affects the global properties of the spacetime , but also has an effect on its curvature .",
    "furthermore , its presence is crucial in order to erase the conical singularity at the origin , and to give rise an spacetime free of ctc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results here obtained are clearly extensible to the four dimensional cosmic string solution , whose metric reads @xmath170 where now the slices @xmath92 are described in cylindrical coordinates @xmath150 . as another remarkable physical consequence , bi gravity seems to forbid the possibility of packing energy in arbitrarily small regions .",
    "differing from gr , any junction of the vacuum solution ( [ metcuerda ] ) with an inner solution has to be made at a radius bigger than @xmath171 .",
    "finally , we can mention that the increasing of the deficit angle ( coming from the change @xmath112 in ( [ metcuerda ] ) ) as the string is closer , might have important observational implications on the lensing effect .",
    "is indebted to alina fiorini for the encouragement afforded during the time of writing these lines .",
