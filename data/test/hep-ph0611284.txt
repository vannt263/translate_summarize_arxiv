    "the conventional explanation for neutrino mass is the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "sterile right - handed neutrinos have very large ( grand unification scale ) majorana masses @xmath0 .",
    "the standard model is then a low energy effective theory , obtained by integrating out the right - handed neutrinos , leading to suppressed induced majorana masses for the left - handed neutrinos , of order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the electroweak scale vev , @xmath3 gev or the typical dirac mass for leptons .",
    "the large @xmath0 break the global lepton numbers of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it is natural to hypothesize that this symmetry breaking is dynamical , much like the chiral dynamics of qcd , and is quite similar to the cooper pairing in a superconductor .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of these global symmetries will produce massless nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb s ) . in the present case such ngb s associated with majorana mass generation",
    "are termed ",
    "majorons \" @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a whole category of new particles , ngb s such as axions @xcite , majorons , familons , etc .",
    ", exists in nature , reflecting the generic breaking of multitudinous global symmetries .",
    "the spontaneously broken global symmetries of the right - handed neutrinos will generally be explicitly broken as well .",
    "this explicit breaking must , at least , arise in the yukawa couplings of the right - handed and left - handed neutrinos to the higgs field of the standard model , i.e. , in the dirac mass terms that marry the left - handed @xmath4 and right - handed sterile neutrinos . in the present paper",
    "we will assume that this is the primary source of the explicit global symmetry breaking , and that any other sources of such breaking do not lead to significantly larger effects than these .",
    "it then follows that the majorons will become pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb s ) at least via loop diagrams that involve insertions of the various yukawa vertices in the presence of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "these loops require sufficiently many insertions that they become finite , and the pngb masses are then `` calculable , '' in a sense discussed by georgi and pais @xcite .",
    "this was further developed by hill and ross @xcite to construct technically natural models , involving cp - violation and other symmetry breaking effects , that give rise to calculable novel long range forces in the context of the standard model .",
    "the finiteness of the induced pngb masses is analogous to what happens in deconstructed extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "e.g. , for qed in @xmath5 an ngb arises that is @xmath6 , the wilson line of the fifth component of the photon vector potential integrated over the compact fifth dimension . in deconstruction",
    ", this is finite when @xmath7 lattice slices are taken for the fifth dimension .",
    "extra dimensions or deconstruction offer a method of solving the naturalness problems associated with large decay constants of axions and other pngb s @xcite .    in the case of majoronic pngb s",
    "the mass scales of majorons are generally small and majorons will have large finite compton wavelengths .",
    "neutrino majorons can thus have astrophysical / cosmological implications .",
    "this was first recognized many years ago as a general mechanism to induce large distance or late - time effects in the not - so early universe by hill , schramm and fry @xcite , and was subsequently developed in greater detail by frieman , stebbins , waga , kolb et.al .",
    "these models , which exploit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking associated with dirac masses , have the virtue of naturalness , and also , unlike dilatonic schemes and a host of random scalar potential models , we _ have prior experience _ in physics with pngb s ( eg .",
    ", the pion is a pngb ) .",
    "these models are amongst the original , and are well motivated as they are the first natural , quintessence models @xcite .",
    "they are also the original models of mass varying neutrinos ( `` mavan s '' ) .",
    "this general phenomenon has been largely rediscovered in recent years @xcite , and the original models can provide a natural origin to an `` acceleron '' field .",
    "the present analysis incorporates many features of @xcite within the context of the seesaw mechanism and the dynamical generation of right - handed majorana masses .",
    "we further investigate the possibility of a majoronic pngb as an `` acceleron , '' studying its implications for the leptonic sector , i.e. , leptogenesis .",
    "consider an extension of the standard model with two right - handed neutrinos @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are singlets under the standard model gauge groups .",
    "there are no majorana masses for these fields and hence lepton number is not explicitly broken at this level .",
    "we introduce two singlet scalar fields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are also singlets under the standard model gauge groups .",
    "we postulate that these fields couple with the right - handed neutrinos as : @xmath12 then these scalars will acquire vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) and will give majorana masses to the right - handed neutrinos . the model possesses a global @xmath13 symmetry . under @xmath13 ,",
    "the quantum numbers of the fields are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "when the @xmath18 acquire vev s , these global symmetries are broken and there will be two nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "we assume that the fields @xmath19 acquire vev s , and it is then useful to parametrize them as nonlinear @xmath20-model fields in terms of the ngb s , @xmath21 and decay constants , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and we have @xmath24 . here",
    "we assume a common value for the decay constants @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath21 are massless ngb s at this stage",
    ".    the @xmath13 symmetry will generally be explicitly broken by the yukawa interactions of the right - handed neutrinos with the left - handed leptons ( @xmath26 ) through the usual standard model higgs doublet ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "if we allow such symmetry breaking terms , there will be divergent contributions to the mass of the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "only when the original symmetry is broken by soft terms , which may originate from electroweak symmetry breaking , then the mass of the pngb remains finite and small .",
    "for this reason we introduce two new higgs doublets @xmath28 and @xmath29 , transforming under the @xmath13 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , to make the theory invariant under @xmath13 . assigning the @xmath13 quantum numbers @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35",
    "the @xmath13 invariant yukawa interactions are given by @xmath36 the soft terms may also originate from some new physics at higher energies .",
    "the higgs scalars @xmath28 and @xmath29 are candidates for cold dark matter of the universe , since they can not decay into quarks or light leptons @xcite .",
    "once the higgs fields develop electroweak scale vevs these become dirac mass terms .",
    "the complete neutrino mass matrix is then : @xmath37 we ve introduced an overall dirac mass parameter @xmath38 and scaling parameters @xmath39 , and we ve also included all the phases which contribute to cp violation .",
    "a three higgs doublet model like the one presented above could also have interesting collider phenomenology , as it has a much richer electroweak symmetry breaking structure than the standard model .",
    "for our purposes it is sufficient to have the three scalars develop an electroweak scale vev which would lead to the dirac masses above .",
    "note that we can make phase redefinitions on the neutrino fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 to try to absorb the majoron fields out of the mass matrix . transforming the neutrinos along with the redefinition of the cp phases",
    ", we can bring the mass matrix into the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is not possible by further transformations to remove the field @xmath45 or phase @xmath46 from the mass terms .",
    "the combination @xmath47 has been absorbed out of the mass terms and remains a massless ngb , while the field @xmath48 becomes a pngb , due to the explicit breaking of the @xmath49 symmetry by the higgs - yukawa terms .",
    "the interaction of the scalar field through the majorana and dirac terms generates a colemann - weinberg effective potential for @xmath45 .",
    "this can be estimated through the leading loop in fig .",
    "1 . it has the remarkable property that the symmetry structure of the theory makes the loop finite .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath45 field could be eliminated if any of the vertices is set to zero .",
    "the vertices in this diagram come after electroweak symmetry breaking . before the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    "the nambu - goldstone boson corresponding to @xmath50 remains massless . after the electroweak symmetry breaking these vertices",
    "appear as soft terms and hence they can not introduce non - renormalizable terms that need to be counter balanced .",
    "note that the phase @xmath46 disappears from the potential and the field @xmath45 can not be removed from the diagram by rephasing of any fields . more generally , the diagram is invariant under any field rephasings involving @xmath21 or other cp phases .",
    "an explicit calculation gives : @xmath51 the potential for the two generation model depends on all coupling constants , is weakly dependent on the heavy scales @xmath0 , and has minima at @xmath52 .",
    "we can expand the potential around one minimum obtaining a constant term , a mass term and higher orders in @xmath45 giving interactions : @xmath53 thus the induced mass of the field @xmath45 is now : @xmath54 if @xmath55 all the @xmath0 dependent factor in the equation above becomes 1 . as mentioned earlier , the symmetry at the scale @xmath56 protects the mass of the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , so an explicit breaking of the symmetry at the scale @xmath38 can generate a mass of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "thus the mass of the scalar is very small .",
    "we now turn to the see - saw mechanism , long - range force , leptogenesis and the origin of dark energy in this model .",
    "we shall next study the neutrino masses in this scenario .",
    "if we ignore the small mass varying effect on the neutrino masses coming from the pngb , the time - development of the light states is determined by the matrix @xmath58 % \\phantom{xxxx}\\ ] ]    where we have assumed @xmath59 .",
    "this mass matrix can be diagonalized to @xmath60 the mixing angle is : @xmath61    we would like to reproduce the maximal mixing observed for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "one possibility that immediately gives this result is to have @xmath62 and @xmath63 , up to terms of order @xmath64 . keeping only the leading terms in @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 ,",
    "the mixing angle becomes : @xmath68 the neutrino masses are given by : @xmath69\\ ] ] and @xmath70\\,.\\ ] ]    the mass squared difference , which should be in the atmospheric range of @xmath71 , is of order @xmath72 : @xmath73 .",
    "since the @xmath72 parameters were assumed to be small , the required right - handed neutrino mass scale should be lower than in standard see - saw type scenarios .    as we go a step further and",
    "keep the linear term in the scalar field , we obtain in addition an interaction between the neutrinos and scalar field .",
    "the exchange of the scalar particle between the eigenstates results in a new force whose range is at our disposal .",
    "we are free to vary the mass of the scalar by selecting values for the decay constant @xmath74 . the final mass and interaction lagrangian , up to terms linear in @xmath75 ,",
    "is given by @xmath76 the off - diagonal long range force predicted by the couplings of the pngb in this model could have direct consequences in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite or in cosmology @xcite .",
    ".5 in    the decays of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath77 violate lepton number and cp violation comes from the cp phase @xmath46 .",
    "there are vertex - type @xcite and self - energy @xcite one - loop diagrams that interfere with the tree - level decays to give an asymmetry as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the generation of a baryon asymmetry requires one more important ingredient , namely , the mixing of the higgs doublets @xmath78 . the quartic couplings @xmath79 give all the required couplings which are not suppressed",
    "we denote the mixing of @xmath27 with @xmath80 by @xmath81 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is heavier than @xmath8 ( @xmath82 ) so that @xmath9 decays first and at a later time the decays of @xmath8 contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "the interference of the tree - level and one - loop diagrams in figure [ figure2 ] generate the asymmetry .",
    "the cross on a fermion line indicates a majorana mass insertion and the cross on a higgs line refers to the mixing between the scalars . the tree - level and one - loop diagrams that contribute to the generation of lepton asymmetry in the decays of @xmath8",
    "are shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "there will be similar diagrams contributing to the process @xmath83 .",
    "the interference between the diagrams give the asymmetry    where @xmath84 .",
    "one interesting feature of this model is that the cp violating phase @xmath46 is solely responsible for the generation of the lepton asymmetry of the universe and the sign of the asymmetry is also determined in terms of the parameters of this model .",
    "this phase may also be observed in lepton number violating processes like neutrinoless double beta decay .    at temperatures above @xmath85 gev",
    ", the out - of - equilibrium condition can be satisfied @xmath86 however , for thermal production of the right - handed neutrinos , the interaction rate ( @xmath87 ) should not be much smaller than the expansion rate of the universe ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "considering the requirement of thermal production and subsequent wash out of the asymmetry , in addition to the suppression factor @xmath89 , which enters if the decay rate is slightly greater than the expansion rate of the universe , the amount of @xmath90 asymmetry is given by @xmath91 the sphaleron interactions now convert this @xmath92 asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of higgs doublets in the standard model .",
    "this can then generate the required amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the basic idea behind the neutrino dark energy ( @xmath95 ) models is that the neutrino mass varies as a function of a light scalar field @xmath96 ( the acceleron ) @xcite and the mass of the acceleron today should be less than @xmath97 . in the present model ,",
    "the pngb @xmath98 corresponding to the soft @xmath99 global symmetry breaking takes the role of the acceleron ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus the mass matrix becomes @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mass of the heavy right - handed neutrino @xmath8 that varies explicitly with the acceleron field @xmath96 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath101 is specified and the effective neutrino mass also varies explicitly @xmath102 , as required by some models of mass varying neutrinos .",
    "the present model has the same generic problems like any other models of mass varying neutrinos @xcite , some of which have been taken care of in variants of this model @xcite , but the main feature of the present model is that it explains the origin of the acceleron field as the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) .",
    "it is also possible to construct scenarios where the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson acts as cold dark matter @xcite or can lead to non - standard structure - formation due to the strong long range interaction among neutrinos .",
    "a large majorana scale for neutrino masses is a necessary component of the see - saw mechanism . at this very high energy scale",
    "there could be global symmetries which are broken in order to produce majorana masses .",
    "remnants of the symmetries may exist at low energy . in this article we proposed a generic model with global symmetry .",
    "the breaking of this global symmetry gives masses to right - handed neutrinos and produces nambu - goldstone bosons .    in this framework we investigated a model with two generations of neutrinos and scalar particles .",
    "we showed that the dirac masses of the neutrinos appearing from the electroweak symmetry breaking implies soft breaking of this global symmetry , which generates an effective potential that is finite .",
    "the nambu - goldstone boson then acquires a mass and produces a long - range force between neutrinos .",
    "their masses have an explicit dependence on the scalar field , which may bring additional density effects producing cosmological consequences .",
    "the model has other attractive properties .",
    "the decays of the heavy neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry consistent with the scenario of leptogenesis .",
    "it also describes the masses and mixings of light neutrinos .",
    "the pngb can play the role of the `` acceleron '' field introduced in models of mass varying neutrinos .",
