    "high precision nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions such as av18  @xcite , cdbonn  @xcite , nijm i , ii and 93  @xcite accurately describe the nn data set up to about 350 mev . when these interactions are used to predict binding energies of three - nucleon ( 3n ) systems they underestimate the experimental bindings of @xmath5 and @xmath6 by about 0.5 - 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "this missing binding energy can be cured by introducing a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) into the nuclear hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the study of elastic nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) scattering and nucleon - induced deuteron breakup also revealed a number of cases where the nonrelativistic description based on pairwise interactions is insufficient to explain the data .",
    "generally , the studied discrepancies between a theory based on nn interactions only and experiment become larger with increasing energy of the 3n system . adding a 3nf that includes long - range @xmath7 exchange to the pairwise interactions leads in some cases to a better description of the data .",
    "the parameters of such a 3nf must be separately adjusted to the experimental binding of @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite for each nn interaction .",
    "the elastic nd angular distribution in the region of its minimum and at backward angles is the best studied example  @xcite . the clear discrepancy in these angular regions at energies below @xmath8  mev nucleon laboratory energy between a theory based on nn interactions only and the cross - section data can be removed by adding modern 3nfs based on chiral effective field theory @xcite to the nuclear hamiltonian . at energies",
    "higher than @xmath8  mev current 3nfs @xcite only partially improve the description of cross section data and the remaining discrepancies , which increase with energy , indicate the possibility of relativistic effects  @xcite . the need for a relativistic description of 3n scattering",
    "was also raised when precise measurements of the total cross section for neutron - deuteron ( nd ) scattering  @xcite were analyzed within the framework of nonrelativistic faddeev calculations  @xcite .",
    "nn interactions alone were insufficient to describe the data above @xmath8  mev .    in few - body models off - shell effects , relativistic effects , and three - body force contributions can not be cleanly separated .",
    "this is because different two - body interactions that give the same two - body @xmath0 matrix are related by a unitary scattering equivalence  @xcite . to maintain",
    "this equivalence at the three - body level requires additional three - body interactions @xcite in one of the hamiltonians .",
    "since relativistic two - body models are fit to the same data as the corresponding nonrelativistic models , there is a similar on - shell two - body scattering equivalence .",
    "while the relativistic and nonrelativistic three - body predictions will be different one can in principle make up the difference ( in a chosen frame ) with a suitable three - body interaction .",
    "so while it is possible to simulate `` relativistic effects '' with a three - body interaction , a poincar invariant treatment of the dynamics provides the most direct way to model the consequences of imposing poincar invariance and s - matrix cluster properties .    in this paper",
    "we investigate one particular representation of the poincar invariant three - body problem .",
    "we compare the predictions of relativistic and nonrelativistic three - body calculations where the input two - body interactions give the same two - body s matrix , have the same internal two - body wave functions , and have a kinematic three - dimensional euclidean symmetry .",
    "the relativistic and nonrelativistic models differ in how these interactions appear in the three body - problem .",
    "in addition , the internal and single particle variables are related by galilean boosts in the nonrelativistic case and lorentz boosts in the relativistic case . in the nonrelativistic case",
    "the two - body interactions for each pair are added to the center of mass kinetic energy operator . in the relativistic case ,",
    "the non - linear relation between the two and three - body mass operators must be respected in order to obtain a scattering matrix that clusters into a product of the identity and the input two - body @xmath0-matrix @xcite .",
    "this non - linear dependence of the three - body invariant mass operator on the two - body interaction has dynamical consequences for the three - body system which complicates the structure of the faddeev kernel .    in  @xcite",
    "we used a poincar invariant formulation of the 3n scattering problem .",
    "a technique for constructing the relativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction from a standard high - precision interaction was given in  @xcite .",
    "we used the same technique to construct the transition operators that appear in the kernel of the relativistic faddeev equation .",
    "application to a 3n bound state supported the relativistic effects previously found in  @xcite .",
    "realistic nn interactions are fit by properly transforming experimental data to the center of momentum frame and fitting @xmath0-matrix elements computed using the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation to this data .",
    "while the same data could be precisely fit using @xmath0-matrix elements computed from a relativistic schrdinger equation , this has not been done @xcite with the same precision used to construct realistic interactions .    in  @xcite , instead , an analytical scale transformation of momenta was used to relate nn interactions in the nonrelativistic and relativistic schrdinger equations in such a way , that the two - body scattering matrix elements are identified as @xmath9 as functions of the center of momentum energy  @xcite . in this work",
    "we use an alternative procedure @xcite that generates a relativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction with the property that the relativistic and nonrelativistic two - body @xmath0 matrices satisfy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the experimental two - body @xmath0 matrix , and @xmath12 is the cm momentum of one of the particles .    when high - precision potentials are determined @xcite by properly lorentz transforming scattering data from the laboratory frame to the center of momentum frame the lorentz invariant scalar product @xmath13 is used to relate the laboratory beam energy @xmath14 to the c.m .",
    "momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the potential is determined by comparing the transformed experimental scattering observables to the scattering observables computed using the nonrelativistic lippmann - schwinger equation , identifying the @xmath12 appearing in the lippmann - schwinger equation with the @xmath12 computed from the invariant @xmath15 . with this procedure",
    "the resulting interactions are constructed so the s - matrix elements in the relativistic and nonrelativistic cases are identified as functions of @xmath12 rather than cm energy .",
    "though the difference in the two approaches leads to a small mismatch in the relativistic and nonrelativistic momentum , the interactions generated by the analytic scale transformation provide a useful first step to investigate the effects of the non - linear relation between the three - body mass operator and two - body interactions .    in our initial studies  @xcite the interaction generated by the analytic scale transformation was used to study the changes in elastic nd scattering and breakup observables when the nonrelativistic form of the kinetic energy is replaced by the relativistic one and a proper treatment of the dynamics is included .",
    "we found that the elastic scattering cross section is only slightly influenced by relativity . only at backward angles and higher energies",
    "the elastic cross sections are increased by relativity .",
    "due to the selectivity of the breakup reaction , however , regions of phase - space were found at higher energies of the incoming nucleon where relativity leads to a characteristic pattern by which relativity changes the nonrelativistic breakup cross section .",
    "namely , in this region of phase - space fixing the angle of the first detected nucleon and changing the angle of the second nucleon provides variations of the nonrelativistic cross section by relativity , increasing or decreasing it by a factor up to @xmath16 . for spin observables the implemented relativistic features lead only to small effects .",
    "recently an interesting estimate of `` relativistic corrections '' has been performed and its effect on low - energy nd analyzing power @xmath2 has been estimated using the plane - wave impulse approximation  @xcite . the estimate is based on a perturbative realization of the poincar lie algebra to leading order in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the calculations are done in the plane - wave impulse approximation .",
    "a large increase by @xmath18 of the @xmath2 maximum at laboratory energy @xmath19  mev has been found .",
    "the authors comment that their estimates are both exploratory and incomplete .",
    "in addition to the absence of final state interaction , there are a number of other important differences with an exact formulation of this problem .",
    "such a large effect , which would significantly reduce the discrepancy between theory and data in the region of the @xmath2 maximum , calls for a relativistic study in an exactly poincar invariant treatment of the three nucleon dynamics .",
    "our previous study  @xcite , performed without inclusion of wigner rotations , is too limited for spin observables . therefore , in order to make definite conclusions for @xmath2 we perform a complete dynamical calculation including the effects of wigner rotations .",
    "we focus on that issue and do not include 3nf s .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the construction of our poincar invariant dynamical model .",
    "this includes a discussion of how high - precision interactions are used to construct the three - body mass operator ( rest hamiltonian ) . in section iii",
    "we discuss spin observables in poincar invariant quantum theory . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the formulation of the faddeev equation to construct scattering observables for this three - nucleon mass operator .",
    "this includes an exact treatment of the faddeev kernel which avoids the approximations used in  @xcite .",
    "we solve the relativistic 3n faddeev equation with and without wigner spin rotations .",
    "we show and discuss results for the neutron analyzing power @xmath2 .",
    "v contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "in a quantum theory the principle of special relativity requires that the probabilities computed for equivalent experiments done in different inertial coordinate systems are identical . since",
    "inertial coordinate systems are related by poincar transformations , it follows @xcite that equivalent states in different inertial coordinate systems are related by a unitary representation , @xmath20 , of the poincar group .",
    "this emphasis on the invariance of experimental measurements in different inertial frames is different than the covariance requirements that are historically motivated by the way symmetries are realized in classical wave equations .",
    "since any representation of the poincar group can be decomposed into a direct integral of irreducible representations , one way to construct a poincar invariant dynamics is to build it out of irreducible representations .",
    "the transformation properties of irreducible representations are well known and completely determined by group theoretical considerations .",
    "the dynamics is contained in the spectrum of the physical mass and spin operators which determines the values and multiplicities of the casimir invariants that appear in this decomposition .",
    "our construction begins with one - particle representations , which are irreducible representations .",
    "the particle s mass and spin fix the eigenvalues of the two casimir invariants of the poincar group . for computations",
    "it is necessary to choose a basis for the irreducible representation space .",
    "this is done by choosing a maximal set of commuting hermitian functions of the infinitesimal poincar generators .",
    "in addition to the mass and spin , it is possible to find four additional mutually commuting non - invariant functions of the generators .",
    "there is a second set of four operators that are conjugate to the non - invariant commuting observables .",
    "these operators change the eigenvalues and determine the spectrum of the commuting observables .",
    "all ten generators can be expressed as functions of these eight non - invariant operators and the two casimir operators .",
    "the irreducible representation space , @xmath21 , is the space of square integrable functions of the eigenvalues of the four commuting operators @xcite .",
    "our choice of basis for irreducible representation spaces is the simultaneous eigenstates of the linear momentum @xmath22 and the 3-component of the canonical spin , @xmath23 , which is the observable corresponding to the spin measured in the particle s rest frame if the particle is transformed to its rest frame with a rotationless lorentz transformation . in this basis",

    "the quantity @xmath29 is the standard rotationless - boost wigner rotation .",
    "the representation ( [ b.1 ] ) is unitary for states with a @xmath30 normalization in the momentum .",
    "the important observation is that _ all _ mass @xmath31 spin @xmath32 irreducible representations of the poincar group in the @xmath33 basis have this form .",

    "@xmath36 define kinematic representations of the poincar group .",
    "these representations are reducible and do not contain any dynamics .",
    "we build dynamical irreducible representations by adding suitable interactions to the mass casimir operator of non - interacting irreducible representations .",
    "the first step needed to introduce interactions is then to decompose these non - interacting tensor product representations into a direct integral of irreducible representations .",
    "this is accomplished with poincar group clebsch - gordan coefficients in our chosen @xmath37 basis .",
    "the poincar group clebsch - gordan coefficients are the expansion coefficients of linear combination of tensor product states that transform irreducibly .",
    "the desired non - interacting irreducible states are computed by ( 1 ) constructing rest eigenstates of the two - body system , ( 2 ) decomposing them into irreducible representations under @xmath38 rotations , ( 3 ) boosting the result to an arbitrary frame .",

    "an irreducible representation is also obtained by changing the order of the spin couplings in ( [ b.3]-[b.4 ] ) where the orbital angular momentum is first coupled to one of the spins , @xmath51 , and then the result is coupled to the second spin . @xmath52 .",

    "the degeneracy parameters @xmath55 are replaced by @xmath56 . when we construct three - body irreducible representations by successive pairwise coupling we use the coupling ( [ b.3 ] ) in the first clebsch - gordan coefficient and the coupling ( [ b.8 ] ) in the second clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "this allows us to identify the quantum numbers of the relativistic irreducible basis with the quantum numbers that we used in previous nonrelativistic calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "three - particle irreducible representations for systems of non - interacting particles can be constructed by successive pairwise coupling of irreducible representations : @xmath57 @xmath58 for three nucleon scattering or bound state problems it is sufficient and convenient to work in the three - body center of momentum frame .",
