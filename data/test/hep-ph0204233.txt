    "one possible signal for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) would be the presence of significant cp violation in the production of @xmath0 leptons  @xcite , or in their decay @xcite .",
    "cp violation in production would arise , assuming that @xmath2 annihilate into a virtual @xmath5 or @xmath6 , from the electric dipole form factor ( edm ) @xmath7 , or its generalization for the @xmath6 coupling , the so - called  weak \" dipole moment form factor ( wdm ) @xmath8 .",
    "these are expected to be unobservably small in the sm .",
    "thus , observation of cp violation in production would be unambiguous evidence for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the signal for cp violation in @xmath0 production would be the non - zero values of certain momentum correlations of the @xmath0 decay products  @xcite since the momenta play the role of spin analyzers for the @xmath0 leptons .",
    "tesla is a proposed @xmath2 linear collider with a center - of - mass energy of @xmath9  gev with the possibility of an extension to @xmath10 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is a multi - purpose machine that will test various aspects of the standard model ( sm ) and search for signals of interactions beyond the standard model . a strong longitudinal polarization program at tesla with considerable polarization of the electron beam , with the possibility of some although not as high a degree of polarization of the positron beam is also planned @xcite .",
    "we assume an integrated luminosity of a few hundred fb@xmath11 , which would lead to copious production of @xmath12 pairs .",
    "longitudinal beam polarization of the electron and positron beams would lead to a substantial enhancement of certain vector correlations , which are non - vanishing in the event that the @xmath0 lepton has an edm or a wdm .",
    "we will assume integrated luminosities of 500 and 1000 fb@xmath11 at center of mass energies of 500 and 800 gev , respectively .",
    "we expect a magnitude of polarization of @xmath13 for the electron beam and @xmath14 for the positron beam .",
    "our aim in this work is to study these vector correlations constructed from the momenta of the charged decay products of @xmath0 leptons .",
    "we will confine our attention to two - body decays of the @xmath0 leptons for which the correlations as well as their variance due to cp conserving standard model interactions can be computed analytically .",
    "we also study the effects of helicity - flip bremsstrahlung  @xcite which contributes to these correlations at @xmath15 .",
    "this is a standard model background to the signal of interest .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we present estimates for the edm and wdm in certain popular extensions of the sm which sets the scale for our studies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : veccorr ] , we discuss the correlations in general and reproduce results from the literature for our vector correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : teslares ] , we discuss the numerical results for tesla energies , luminosities , and polarizations , including the limits achievable . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the implications of our results for the configuration being planned at tesla and how our results will translate into certain design criteria for the machine and the detector .",
    "cp violating dipole moments of leptons can arise in the standard model radiatively .",
    "however , since there is no cp violation in the lepton sector in sm , it can only be induced by cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "one has to go at least to 3-loop order to generate a non - vanishing contribution to the lepton dipole moments @xcite .",
    "a crude estimate gives @xmath16    extensions of the sm where complex couplings appear can easily generate cp - violating dipole moments for @xmath0 lepton at one - loop order .",
    "provided these couplings are generation or mass dependent , it is possible that reasonably large dipole moments for the @xmath0 lepton are generated , while continuing to satisfy the constraints coming from strong limits on the electric dipole moments of the electron or the neutron .",
    "since dipole couplings of fermions are chirality flipping , they would be proportional to a fermionic mass . however , this need not necessarily be the mass of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "it could be the mass of some other heavy fermion in the theory . as a result ,",
    "the dipole coupling at energy of @xmath17 need not necessarily by suppressed by a factor of @xmath18 , but could involve a factor @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a new heavy particle in the extension of the sm , and this factor need not be small .",
    "it is thus possible to get dipole form factors almost of the order of @xmath21 in units of an inverse mass which appears in the loop .",
    "if the mass is that of @xmath22 or @xmath6 , it is possible to get dipole moments of the order of @xmath23 e - cm . in actual practice , however , the particle appearing in the loop is also constrained to be heavy . as a result",
    ", the dipole moments in left - right symmetric models , higgs exchange model with spontaneous cp violation and natural flavor conservation , and supersymmetric models turn out to be of the order of @xmath24 e - cm , or smaller @xcite .    in the case of most models",
    ", information exists in the literature for the values of electric and weak dipole form factors only at @xmath25 values of 0 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "models in which the @xmath25 dependence of the cp - violating form factors has been studied are scalar leptoquark models with couplings only to the third generation of quarks and leptons . of these , the most promising model is the one in which the leptoquark transforms as an @xmath27 doublet . in",
    "@xcite a value of re  @xmath28  e - cm was found above the @xmath6 resonance , with re @xmath29 about @xmath30 of this value for a more favorable case .",
    "taking into account restrictions on the doublet leptoquark mass and couplings coming from lep data values of @xmath31  e - cm and @xmath32  e - cmwere estimated at @xmath33  gev @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath0 dipole form factors of the order of @xmath34 are also obtained in models with majorana neutrinos of mass of a few hundred gev , and of the order of @xmath35 in two - higgs doublet extensions with natural flavor conservation , and in supersymmetric models through a complex @xmath36neutralino coupling , not far from the @xmath37 threshold @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite an extensive analysis of momentum correlations",
    "was first presented in the context of the reaction @xmath38 , and was subsequently generalized to energies far away from the @xmath6 resonance in  @xcite .",
    "expressions were presented there for the @xmath0 production matrix @xmath39 involving the edm and the wdm , in addition to the main contribution from sm vertices , which is required to compute the production cross - section , the momentum correlations of interest , as well as their variances , also taking into account the @xmath40 matrices that account for the decay of the @xmath0 into ( two - body ) final states . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the limit of vanishing electron mass , the initial state depends on the electron polarization @xmath41 and the positron polarization @xmath42 only through the cp - even combinations @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore one may search for cp violation through the non - vanishing expectation values of cp - odd momentum correlations for arbitrary electron and positron polarizations .",
    "in particular , simple `` vector '' correlations for which the correlations as well as their variances could be computed in closed form , were shown to have enhanced sensitivity to cp violating edm and wdm of the @xmath0 leptons at slc , and at the energies of a tau - charm factory . in this work",
    ", we shall examine these correlations for their sensitivity to @xmath0 edm and wdm at tesla energies , polarizations and luminosities .",
    "the cp - odd momentum correlations we consider here are associated with the center of mass momenta @xmath45 of @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xmath48 , where the @xmath46 and @xmath48 arise in the decays @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and where @xmath51 run over @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . in the case when @xmath48 and @xmath55 are different , one has to consider also the decays with @xmath48 and @xmath55 interchanged , so as to construct correlations which are explicitly cp - odd .",
    "the correlations we consider are @xmath56\\ ] ] and @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the unit vector in the positron beam direction .",
    "note that since @xmath59 is cpt - odd it measures @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61 is cp - even and measures @xmath62 .",
    "an additional advantage of these correlations is that the correlations as well as the standard deviation for the operators due to the standard model background are both calculable in closed form for two - body decays of the @xmath0 leptons .",
    "the calculations include two - body decay modes of the @xmath0 in general and are applied specifically to the case of @xmath63 and @xmath64 due to the fact that these modes possess a good resolving power of the @xmath0 polarization , parameterized in terms of the constant @xmath65 for the @xmath52 channel ( with branching fraction of about @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 for the @xmath53 channel ( with branching fraction of about @xmath68 ) from the momentum of the @xmath52 or the @xmath53 .",
    "analytic expressions for these correlations can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of convenience of reference and completeness , we give the expressions here . with the definitions @xmath69 and the effective polarization parameter @xmath70 ( the vector and axial - vector couplings @xmath71 are listed in @xcite ) , @xmath72 , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the cross - section of @xmath77 given by : @xmath78,\\ ] ] and @xmath79.\\ ] ] since the energies involved are far above the @xmath6 resonance , we have neglected the @xmath6 width in the expressions above .",

    "[ tab : ind ] ) .",
    "a priori it can not be said by how much better tensor correlations of the type considered in @xcite will fare when polarization is included and conclusions can not be drawn unless they are fully studied .",
    "however , it must be noted that the sensitivities we have reported here are significantly superior to those obtainable from the tensor correlations with no beam polarization .",
    "the vector correlations are significantly enhanced due to longitudinal polarization of the beams .",
    "the precision achievable without polarization would be at least an order of magnitude reduced .",
    "since the effective polarization parameter is already close to unity with the designed electron polarization alone , the gain from positron polarization even at @xmath14 improves the sensitivity by a factor of 2 at most .",
    "the measurements are not very sensitive to the precise value of the polarizations .",
