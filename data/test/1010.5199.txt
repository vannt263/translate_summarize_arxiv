    "for the past two decades there has been a revival of interest in issues related to charge migration in dna based oligomers .",
    "on one side , charge transfer ( ct ) in dna is supposed to play a key role in self - repair processes of dna damage in natural conditions , i.e. via oxidative stress  @xcite . on the other side , dna may have a huge potential application field in the development of complex nano - scale electronic devices with self - assembling properties , since self - assembly , recognition and fully - automatic synthesis of oligonucleotides  @xcite can allow for building almost any imaginable two and three dimensional dna motifs ( e.g. dna - origami )  @xcite .",
    "however , besides considerable progress in elucidating the possible charge transfer mechanisms efficient in dna , there is still disagreement about the conduction properties of dsdna , for several experiments obtained quite controversial results ranging from insulating  @xcite , over semi - conducting  @xcite to even metallic - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "this broad variability is related not only to the poor control of the experimental conditions in earlier transport experiments , but is also due to the intrinsic structural and electronic complexity of dna oligomers ( e.g. specific base pair sequence ) , which makes the formulation of a general theoretical framework very challenging .",
    "nevertheless , several experiments appeared recently  @xcite which have shown electrical currents in the na range despite the differences in the studied base sequences and in the experimental setups .",
    "one central issue which has emerged by the theoretical treatment of charge transport is the necessity to consider the conformational fluctuations of the molecular frame not as a weak perturbation but rather as a crucial factor promoting or hindering charge motion  @xcite .",
    "it has been meanwhile shown that it is possible to synthesize dna derivatives , which do not necessarily have the double - strand structure of natural dna .",
    "thus , c and g - rich dna strands are able to form four - stranded quadruplex structures , like the i - motif structure composed of two parallel hemiprotonated duplexes intercalated into each other into a head - to - tail orientation , and the g4-quadruplex ( also known as g4-dna ) which is formed by either one , two or four g - rich dna strands in a parallel or anti - parallel orientation  @xcite .",
    "the latter is supposed to play an important role in some biological processes such as in telomeric dna regions , where it inhibits telomerase and hiv integrase  @xcite . additionally , g4-dna is known to interact with various cell proteins that cause diseases like bloom s and werner s syndromes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , g4-dna is cytotoxic towards tumor cells and therefore , might be a key for the design of anti - cancer drugs  @xcite . eventually , g - quadruplexes are found to be thermally more stable than dsdna  @xcite .",
    "gilbert and sen resolved the x - ray structure of the first g - quadruplex and proposed the formation of these unique structures in presence of monovalent alkali ions  @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : meth - tetrad](a ) .",
    "consequently , g4-dna can be regarded as stacks composed of individual planar g - tetrads ( or g - quartets ) as shown in fig .",

    "@xcite have shown the larger polarizability of g4-dna compared to dsdna , when attached to gold surfaces .",
    "this might be an indicator of improved ct properties and the potential advantage of using g4-dna rather than dsdna in molecular scale devices .",
    "eventually , the higher conductance in g4-dna could be attributed to the increased structural stability and higher number of overlapping @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "furthermore , experimental work by kotlyar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite revealed that up to 300 nm long g4-wires could be synthesized revealing a considerable stability even in the absence of metal ions .",
    "also , theoretical studies have been performed on the stability and rigidity of g4-dna .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations by pakov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite could confirm the experimental results .",
    "for one thing , g4-dna is more rigid than dsdna and for another monovalent ions within the quadruplex cavity are necessary for the stability of short g4-dna .",
    "on the other hand , md simulations  @xcite pointed out the stability of longer g4 molecules ( with 24 g - tetrads ) in absence of metal ions which is consistent with the synthetic procedure of ref  @xcite .",
    "electronic structure calculations by di felice and co - workers  @xcite showed a higher degree of delocalization of the electronic states in g4 than in dsdna .",
    "moreover , the presence of metal ions may contribute additional states supporting ct , though this is a still unresolved issue .",
    "guo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently shown using the landauer theory ( coherent transport ) that g4-dna exhibits much larger delocalization lengths at the band center compared to double - stranded poly(g ) dna .",
    "surprisingly , it was also found out that the delocalization length can be even enhanced via environment - induced disorder through the backbones .",
    "though these studies assume a static atomic structure , they nevertheless suggest that disorder plays an important , non - trivial role in mediating ct in dna .",
    "similarly , it is known from other biomolecules such as proteins that electron transport is dominated by non - equilibrium fluctuations which has lately been analyzed by balabin _",
    "et al . _",
    "as demonstrated in previous studies , idealized static structures are not representative when considering ct properties , since dynamical as well as environmental effects were shown to be too important  @xcite .",
    "it was indicated that dynamic disorder has dramatic effects , since it suppresses ct in homogeneous sequences on the one hand , but can enhance ct in heterogeneous sequences , on the other .",
    "for instance , in our previous work  @xcite , the conductance of the dickerson dodecamer ( sequence : 5-cgcgaattcgcg-3 ) was found to be almost one order of magnitude larger in solution ( qm / mm ) than in vacuo .",
    "interestingly , similar findings have recently been shown by scheer and co - workers , for they obtained for a heterogeneous sequence ( i.e. a and g bases are present ) with 31 base pairs  @xcite a two order of magnitude larger conductance in solution compared to the in vacuo measurements  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it could be shown that only a minor part of the conformations is ct - active  @xcite . therefore , neglecting these significant factors or assuming a purely random disorder distribution can lead to a considerable loss of a vital part of ct - relevant structural and electronic information .",
    "relying on our previously developed methodologies to deal with ct in different dna oligomers  @xcite , we present here a detailed investigation of charge transport in g4-dna .",

    "more importantly , we point out significant factors which are responsible for the enhanced conductance in g4 molecular wires .",
    "the molecules used in this work are based on the x - ray crystal structure of a tetrameric parallel - stranded quadruplex ( 244d ) formed by the hexanucleotide sequence d(tg@xmath1 t ) in the presence of sodium ions .",

    "furthermore , two longer g4 quadruplexes with 12 and 30 tetrads , denoted as ( g@xmath2)@xmath1 and ( g@xmath3)@xmath1 , are generated by omitting the terminal thymine residues and adding subsequently g4 tetrads with a distance of 3.4  and twisted by 30 . for comparison ,",

    "we will shortly describe how the electronic structure of g4-dna molecules is mapped to a coarse - grained transfer hamiltonian using the fragment orbital ( fo ) approach .",
    "the method has already successfully been applied to dsdna molecules  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the methodology can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . to begin with",
    ", the electronic structure of the dna system is written in an effective tight - binding basis ( fragment basis ) as : @xmath7 the onsite energies @xmath8 and the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals @xmath9 characterize , respectively , effective ionization energies and electronic couplings of the molecular fragments .",
    "the evaluation of these parameters can be done very efficiently using the scc - dftb method  @xcite combined with a fragment orbital ( fo ) approach  @xcite : @xmath10 and @xmath11 the indexes @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to the fragments of the quadruplexes which , in this model , are constituted by single guanine bases .",
    "accordingly , the molecular orbitals @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the respective highest - occupied molecular orbitals which are obtained by performing scc - dftb calculations for these isolated fragments , i.e. the individual guanine bases . using a linear combinations of atomic orbitals ansatz @xmath16",
    "the coupling and overlap integrals can be efficiently evaluated as : @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hamilton and overlap matrices in the atomic basis set as evaluated with the scc - dftb method .",
    "note , since @xmath21 is built from non - orthogonal orbitals @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which is for various problems not suitable , we apply the loewdin transformation  @xcite : @xmath22 the effect of the environment ,  the electrostatic field of the dna backbone , the water molecules and the counter - ions ( including the central alkali ions within the quadruplex ) , is taken into account through the following qm / mm hamiltonian : @xmath23 @xmath24 are the mulliken charges in the qm region and @xmath25 are the charges in the mm region ,  the dna backbone , counterions and water molecules . the coupling to the environment",
    "is therefore explicitly described via the interactions with the @xmath25 charges . in the following",
    ", we will denote the calculation set - up based on the complete expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : qmmm ] as qm / mm ; neglecting the last term will be denoted as `` vacuo '' .",

    "subsequently , the transfer hamiltonian is used to calculate the ct in the quadruplexes as described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : meth - tc ] .",
    "once the transfer hamiltonian has been constructed , the transport properties will be calculated using landauer theory for each snapshot along the md trajectories .",
    "for this , we consider a two - terminal set up where the g4 oligomer is contacted to left ( l ) and right ( r ) metallic electrodes through the four terminal bases .",
    "a central quantity to be computed is the molecular ( g4 ) green function , which can be obtained through a dyson equation : @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are self - energy matrices characterizing the coupling to the electrodes . to simplify the calculations",

    "the reader should note that the current could exhibit quite different shapes depending on where @xmath38 is located .",

    "however , one sodium ion in the middle of the quadruplex is located in - plane and two others are rather closer to one of the corresponding tetrads than sandwiched between them .",

    "this might be an indicator for the longitudinal mobility of central sodium and lithium ions within guanine quadruplexes .",
    "in contrast , potassium ions are rather fixed in their center position between two tetrads , most likely because of their larger ionic radii compared with lithium and sodium .",

    "likewise , solvent molecules are able to infiltrate the quadruplex via the minor groove and the 5 and 3 ends provided that these locations are not already occupied by initially placed ions . usually , the infiltration of solvent molecules into the helix will not significantly destabilize the structure as long as there is at least a minimum amount of central monovalent cations left in the quadruplex . otherwise , the interior solvation might destroy the regular 4-stranded structure as can be seen for the structures without central ions in fig .",

    "[ fig : g4-trans - ideal ] . nevertheless , the maximum of @xmath43 for the two central tetrads in ( tg@xmath1t)@xmath1 is almost five times larger compared to g@xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , the maximum current is about 4.4 times larger in the quadruplex .        considering the octamers in fig .  [ fig : compare - dsdna1](b ) the conductance difference between g4 and poly(g ) even increases . here , the average transmission in the relevant energy range for the quadruplex is to a great extent two orders of magnitude larger than those for the poly(g ) sequence .",
    "the poly(g ) spectra shows much larger spikes at certain energies .",
    "these spikes indicate the strong impact of dynamics and may be explained by the existence of few charge transfer active conformations , which dominate the average transmission , i.e. few conformations , which feature a high transmission .",
    "this may indicate that even longer sampling ( more than 30 ns ) would be required to converge the spectra .",
    "notwithstanding , it also reveals that in dsdna the average current is dominated to a much larger degree on few non - equilibrium structures , as concluded from our earlier work  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the average current @xmath44 for ( g@xmath45)@xmath6 is almost two orders of magnitude larger than for g@xmath45 suggesting that the enhancement of ct in g4 with respect to poly(g ) might grow with increasing dna length .    thus , additional sets of ct calculations for longer dna species with 14 and 20 tetrads ( base pairs ) , respectively , are carried out .",
    "the corresponding data was obtained from md simulations of a quadruplex ( g@xmath3)@xmath1 ( including central na@xmath5 ) , and double - stranded dnas g@xmath3 and a heterogeneous sequence containing 31 sites  @xcite recently used by scheer and co - workers in a ct - measurement  @xcite ( note , for ct calculations only the 14 ( 20 ) central sites are used ) .",
    "as expected , the transmission strongly decreases for both dna species .",
    "however , in g4 this effect is not as strong as in dsdna .",
    "for instance the current for ( g@xmath46)@xmath1 is only about 1 order of magnitude lower than for ( g@xmath47)@xmath1 , although expanding to ( g@xmath48)@xmath1 the current drops significantly additional 3 orders of magnitude . in contrast , @xmath44 for poly(g ) and the `` scheer '' sequence decreases by more than 10 orders of magnitude by increasing the number of base pairs from 14 to 20 .",
    "this indicate there is a much stronger distance dependence of ct in dsdna , hence the notion of coherent ct for longer molecular wires might be considerably more likely in g4 than in dsdna .",
    "admittedly , the landauer formalism used in this work performs well for short dna species ( less than 10 sites ) , where the transport is assumed to be at least partially coherent .",
    "on the other hand , it clearly fails for long dna sequences , hence the ct results for the longer molecules should be interpreted only qualitatively and with caution .",
    "for instance , the currents obtained for the 14mer and 20mer of both dsdna molecules poly(g ) and the scheer sequence are orders of magnitude smaller than pa which is far beyond any measurable range .",
    "the complete data is given in fig .",

    "the significant conductance difference of g4 and dsdna may not be attributed to the fact that g4 is composed of four poly(g ) like wires . to analyze this further the ct in ( g@xmath47)@xmath1 with central sodium ions ( full md )",

    "[ fig : transport - fullvsintrainter ] , the average transmissions for the two models : full md and intra+inter in the spectral support region clearly reveal the largest plateaus , also showing similar peak structures .",
    "however , both quadruplex models exhibit similar moderate fluctuations . by contrast , the sum of the four single g4 strands ( @xmath494s ) shows much larger fluctuations , comparable with those for g@xmath45 ( 4xpg ) .",
    "moreover , the average transmission for @xmath494s is significantly reduced and is even slightly lower than 4xpg .",
    "interestingly , in @xmath494s are barely ct - active conformations , i.e. single dominating peaks like in 4xpg which sometimes even outreach the maximum transmission of the quadruplex ( full md ) .",
    "this might reflect the structural differences between quadruplexes and dsdna , since the four strands in the quadruplex are not as flexible as those in poly(g ) ( see also rmsd fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsd2 ] ) , hence in poly(g ) the structural phase space is much larger and therefore , several high - transmissive structures can arise . on the other hand ,",
    "the more rigid quadruplex covers only a smaller conformational phase space which indeed ensures a large number of structures showing moderate ct properties for each single strand , respectively .",
    "this clearly indicates , that the most important factor for the enhanced conductance in g4 are the interstrand couplings between the 4 strands in the quadruplex .",
    "thus , if there are conformations in which the 4 isolated channels are not transmissive , there is a considerable probability that ct might occur via coupling between the individual stands . as can be extracted from tab .",
    "[ tab : hop - g4 ] those interstrand couplings are sufficiently large with about 0.01 - 0.02 ev .",

    "note the x - axis is scaled logarithmic .",
    "in addition , the g4 pdf is significantly shifted to higher transmission .",
    "this underscores that the majority of poly(g ) structures is not transmissive , yet a few single conformations are responsible for the average ct . on the other hand , for @xmath494s",
    "the major part of conformations reveal higher transmission than in 4xpg , but the single dominating conformations are missing . clearly , this explains that these single high - transmissive poly(g ) conformations are the reason for a better conductivity in 4xpg compared to @xmath494s .",
    "the higher average t1 values in dsdna are due to few highly conducting conformations .",
    "the smaller average of the g4 t1 couplings therefore resembles a more stable structure , however , not leading to a higher conductance , as could be argued beforehand .",

    "therefore , the question arises whether the ct in an all - parallel stranded quadruplex differs if only 2 or even 1 strand of the quadruplex are coupled to the left and right contacts , respectively . for that purpose , the ct in ( g@xmath47)@xmath1 ( na+ ) is calculated for various contact models : i ) all 4 strands are connected to the left and right electrodes , respectively ( 1 - 4 ) , ii ) only one strand is connected to both contacts ( 1-intra ) and iii - v ) one strand is attached to the left electrode while one of the remaining is contacted to the right one ( 12-inter , etc . ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport - contact - ana ] , reducing the number of connected strands from 4 to 1 leads to an decrease in @xmath43 for the relevant energy range of about 1 order of magnitude . however , the transmission for the 1-intra and inter models is very similar indicating a minor significance for which strand or strands are connected to the contacts .",
    "this finding is also supported by the i - v characteristics , for the current ranges around 0.2 na for these models which is roughly one order of magnitude smaller as though all 4 strands are attached ( 1 - 4 model ) .    )",

    "interestingly , there seems to be an increase in the transmission fluctuations if the quadruplex is contacted through only one strand at each end .",

    ".        basically , for heterogeneous sequences ( not shown here ) a reduced transmission in vacuo is found , which is caused by energy gaps between a and g states .",

    "the phase space of the single strands still contains a vast majority of conformations , which are not ct active .",
