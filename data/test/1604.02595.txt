    "in previous works we compared the performances of an x - ray tes microcalorimeter under ac and dc bias by measuring the iv characteristic , the noise , the impedance and the x - ray response at perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the tests were carried out both with an sron pixel and a gsfc pixel @xcite . with respect to the dc bias case , under ac bias we observe a smaller ( about @xmath2 ) current output at small voltage bias low in the transition , a low tes current and temperature sensitivity , a slightly worse integrated nep resolution and about a factor two x - ray resolution degradation . in order to better understand the reasons for the suboptimal performance of the tess under ac bias we thoroughly studied the effect of the perpendicular magnetic field and the voltage bias on the detector response . here",
    "we present the results obtained with a gsfc pixel read out both in the ac and dc configuration .",

    "the impedance of the lc circuit seen by the tes is then @xmath8 .",
    "the lc resonator consists of an hybrid filter with a lithographic nb - film coil with @xmath9 and commercial high - q np0 smd capacitors with @xmath10 .",
    "the circuit has an additive total stray inductance of about @xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic resonator factor of the lc resonator is @xmath12 , limited by losses in the lumped elements circuit .    as amplifiers we used a nist squid arrays consisting of a series of 100 dc - squid with input - feedback coil turns ratio of 3:1 , and input inductance @xmath13 .",
    "the input current noise is @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "the squid amplifier is operated in a standard analogue flux - locked - loop ( fll ) mode using commercial magnicon electronics , which linearises the squid response . only at frequencies below @xmath16",
    "the fll has enough loop gain to sufficiently linearise the signal response .",
    "for this reason our experiments are carried out at a resonant frequency of @xmath17 .",
    "the circuit resonant frequency is defined by the capacitor c and the total inductance @xmath18 , where the last term accounts for the screening effect of the superconducting transformer and @xmath19 is an inductance generated by the squid feedback loop . from the measured resonant frequency and the filter capacitance reported above we get @xmath20 .",

    "described here we used an xray tes microcalorimeter from the gsfc .",

    "the x - ray resolution is comparable to the baseline resolution and is generally of the order of 2.3 - 2.5ev .",

    "we observed a remanent perpendicular field of @xmath28 .",
    "the pattern observed is due to the dependency of the detector critical current on the magnetic field as a result of the tes behaving as a weak - link @xcite .",
    "the shift of the josephson patterns along the applied magnetic field is due to the self magnetic field generated by the dc current flowing through the leads connecting the tes @xcite .     and @xmath29 mgauss .",
    "the points in red up triangles are the results of measurements taken under identical experimental condition , but on a different day.[nep_acdcbias ] ]    under ac bias we measured the @xmath26 as a function of the applied perpendicular magnetic field @xmath27 as well . at this pixel",

    "[ nep_acdcbias]*b*.    from the plots we observe that , under ac bias : the fraunhofer - like oscillations are visible , but the pattern is more noisy and less reproducible than under dc bias ; the baseline resolution is slightly worse and strongly depends on the bias voltage .",
    "while the former effect is likely due to the self magnetic field , the latter has a less trivial explanation . in an attempt to clarify these results",
    ", we performed a fine scan of the detector i - v characteristic by measuring for every bias point the detector x - ray response and the noise .",
    "we repeated the scan for different magnetic fields .",
    "we discovered that the baseline energy resolution strongly depends on the detector bias point .",
    "a very small variation ( @xmath31 ) of the bias current could result in an energy resolution degradation of more than a factor three .",

    "the detector response bandwidth is not identical under ac and dc bias due to the different load impedance of the two circuits @xcite .",
    "one should refer to the nep plot when comparing the ac and dc cases .    ]",
    "the nep is the lowest under dc bias . at low frequency ( @xmath35 )",
    "the degradation in the nep observed in the ac bias case is probably due to a reduced responsivity . at high frequency ( @xmath36 ) excess noise is observed in the ac bias case .",
    "the excess noise is worse for the measurement taken at the rising part of the steps and has the signature of excess johnson noise .",
    "furthermore , the noise level at frequency @xmath36 in the spectra corresponding to the 3.5 ev integrated nep taken under ac bias , can not be explained by simply including the squid and the lc resonator thermal noise .",
    "an excess white noise of about @xmath37 is estimated from the model . under ac bias",
    "the responsivity is independent on the two bias points .",
    "in analogy with the analysis done for an rf - squid @xcite we calculate the characteristic parameters of a tes in a superconducting loop weakly coupled via a superconducting transformer to an lc resonant circuit .",
    "the tes is treated as a weak - link in accordance with the rsj model where @xmath38 is assumed to be tes normal resistance . for the detector described above",
    "we find the cut - off and the characteristic frequency to be respectively @xmath39 where a critical current of about @xmath40 is assumed .",
    "note that the tes critical current at a @xmath41 is generally larger than @xmath42 ( @xmath43 at 55mk @xcite ) .",
    "however in bias conditions the tes operating temperature is @xmath44 and the critical current drops .",
    "the screening parameter is @xmath45 .",
    "the rfsquid - like ac biased tes operates then in an adiabatic and hysteretic regime , since @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "the steps in the tes iv curves have a non zero slope ( fig.[desivsibias]*a . * ) .",
    "the tilting of the steps in the rf - squid i - v characteristic and the rounding of the step edges reflect directly the width of the quantum transitions distribution due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "kurkijrvi @xcite have shown that the ratio @xmath48 of the voltage rise along a step @xmath49 to the voltage difference @xmath50 between steps is directly proportional to the squid s instrinsic flux noise @xcite .",
    "their empirical formula gives @xmath51 in the same way we can estimate the flux noise in the tes superconducting ring . from the step observed in the iv curves we get an @xmath52 , which corresponds to a flux noise of @xmath53 .",
    "for a 17 nh inductance ring this is equivalent to a current noise of @xmath54 .",
    "this noise level is comparable with the excess noise observed in the ac bias detector , which limits the best measured integrated nep to @xmath55 .",
    "we observed excess noise and low reproducibility in the ac biased x - ray pixel .",
    "a strong dependency of the baseline noise on the bias voltage is at the origin of the non reproducible results obtained in the past . in the iv curve under ac bias",
    "a staircase structure is observed .",
    "a possible interpretation of this effect is given by comparing the detector and the ac read - out to an rf - squid . in this analogy",
    "the tes is seen as a weak - link in a superconducting ring weakly coupled to an lc resonator .",
    "should this interpretation be valid , the excess noise observed in the ac bias experiment could be due to flux noise generated by the uncertainties in the quantum transition .    to validate this hypothesis",
    "the following tests should be performed in the future : measurements with large l and high bias frequency ( @xmath56 ) since in the rf - squid the flux noise decreases at higher rf tank frequencies and the detector operates in a non - adiabatic regime where rf - squid amplifiers show lower flux noise @xcite ; measurements of excess noise ( integrated nep ) as function of temperature since a weak dependency to @xmath57 is expected @xcite ; experiments with tess with different weak - link parameters ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) to achieve a non - hysteretic regime .",
