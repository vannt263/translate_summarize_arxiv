    "even though the understanding of phase separation and related interfacial phenomena for two - dimensional systems such as the ising model , has greatly improved recently , the situation for three - dimensional systems remains quite unsatisfactory .",
    "for example , even in the three - dimensional ising model , several basic questions remain open : existence of a roughening transition , proof that the wetting transition occurs at a non - trivial value of the boundary magnetic field ( or proof of the contrary ) , or even instability of the @xmath2-interface .",
    "to gain some insights in these problems , it is very useful to consider simpler sos - type , effective models for interfaces . in these models ,",
    "the interface is modelized as a function @xmath3 from a subset of @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 , but we restrict our attention to the former case ) where @xmath7 represents the height of the surface above , or below , the site @xmath8 ; the energy associated to this surface is specified by some function of these heights , @xmath9 . unfortunately ,",
    "even these much simplified models remain rather difficult to handle , and most of the results which have been obtained are restricted to the harmonic case , where @xmath10 .",
    "it is therefore valuable to find ways to extend such results to a larger class of models , by providing arguments which are less sensitive to the particular features of the underlying interaction .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend to a large class of interactions results about the pinning of an interface by a weak potential .",
    "we emphasize that these results do not follow from perturbation around the gaussian case .",
    "let @xmath11 ^ 2\\cap{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z^2}}}$ ] .",
    "it is well known that the mean square height at any fixed site @xmath12 w.r.t .",
    "the gaussian measure with @xmath13-boundary condition has a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the addition of an arbitrarily weak self - potential favouring height @xmath13 would localize the surface , in the sense that this mean square height remains bounded uniformly in @xmath14 .",
    "we show that this holds for a large class of finite - range non - gaussian interactions .    as a byproduct of our technique",
    ", we also obtain an improved version of a result of @xcite proving the existence of a massgap for the model with nearest - neighbours , gaussian interactions , in the presence of an arbitrarily weak pinning potential .",
    "even though we are not able to extend their result to non - gaussian interactions , we show that it holds in the following situations : ( 1 ) for a large class of finite - range non - gaussian interactions but with a sufficiently strong @xmath1-pinning , and ( 2 ) for a large class of finite - range gaussian interactions with arbitrarily weak @xmath1-pinning .",
    "we finally prove the following new result ( as far as we know ) on the tail of the distribution , valid for the same class of finite - range non - gaussian interactions submitted either to square - well or @xmath1 potentials : the probability that the height of the interface above some site @xmath8 is larger than @xmath15 ( large ) is bounded from above by @xmath16 ; this implies of course existence of all moments , including exponential ones .",
    "if the interaction has bounded second derivatives , then we also prove the corresponding lower bound .",
    "we restrict our attention to dimension two since it is the relevant case to describe an interface in a three - dimensional medium .",
    "it is also the most interesting one as far as pinning is concerned .",
    "indeed , in dimensions greater than two , the situation is completely different : the mean square of the height of the interface is already finite _ without _ a pinning potential .",
    "the behaviour of the two - point function is also different : without pinning potential , it has a power - law decay .",
    "however , the addition of such a potential would make this decay exponential .    in section [ s_statements ]",
    ", we define the models and state the main results of this paper .",
    "proofs of these statements are given in sections [ s_pinv ] and [ s_expdecay ] .",
    "our main estimate , proposition [ pro_drydecay ] , is proved in section [ s_mainestimate ] .",
    "some technical estimates are given in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath17 be some strictly positive integer , the _ range _ of the interaction .",
    "the interaction between sites @xmath8 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 is supposed to satisfy the following conditions :    * * translation invariance : * @xmath20 . * * finite range : * @xmath21 if @xmath22 . * * symmetry : * @xmath23 and @xmath24 . * * smoothness : * @xmath25 is twice continuously differentiable . *",
