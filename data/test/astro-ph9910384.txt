    "as well as studying studying the unresolved diffuse galactic emission ( the galactic ridge x - ray emission ) , one of the main scientific objectives of the bepposax galactic plane survey is to search for faint x - ray pulsars . currently , there are @xmath1180 known accreting x - ray pulsars ( see bildsten et al .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . until recently only relatively bright nearby pulsars were visible due to the limited sensitivity of the available detectors .",
    "this is changing with the discovery by asca , bepposax , and rxte of a population of faint ( @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath9 ) pulsars ( e.g. , angelini et al . @xcite ; kinugasa et al .",

    "these new pulsars tend to have long periods and it is likely that the centrifugal barrier , which inhibits accretion in rapidly rotating neutron stars at low luminosities ( e.g. , stella et al .",
    "@xcite ) , is almost always open , allowing them to reach very low flux levels .",
    "it is thus likely that a population of low - luminosity x - ray binaries is being observed , the emission from which may contribute significantly to the unresolved galactic component .",

    "the mecs consists of two grazing incidence telescopes with imaging gas scintillation proportional counters in their focal planes .",

    "the exposures in the lecs and mecs are 9.6  ks and 27  ks , respectively . the mecs image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) reveals the presence of at least 3 relatively bright sources . of interest here is a new source located 71 off - axis , with a count rate of @xmath17  s@xmath9 for both mecs units",

    "the arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter .",
    "initially , a period search ( using the xronos routine efsearch ) in the range 1001000  s was performed .",
    "the strongest peaks were found at a period of 437  s and at twice this period ( 874  s ) , with  values of 42 and 34 , respectively , for 8 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . in order to better asses the significance of these peaks a lomb - scargle periodogram",
    "was generated ( fig .",

    "no other strong peaks are evident .",
    "the period was refined by cross - correlating pulse profiles each obtained by folding data from 5 consecutive intervals .",
    "this yields a pulse period of @xmath3  s ( at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the 1.810  kev background subtracted pulse profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) shows a peaked modulation with a semi - amplitude ( half of the peak - to - peak modulation divided by the mean ) of @xmath19% , with an additional uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the background subtraction of 10% ( see fig . [",
    "fig : profile ] ) .",
    "the pulse profile does not show any obvious energy dependence .",
    "the 1.810  kev lightcurve does not show evidence for variability .",

    "lecs and mecs data were extracted centered on the position of   using a radius of 4  for both instruments .",
    "both spectra were rebinned to a minimum of 30 counts per bin , and oversampling the full - width at half maximum of the energy resolution by at most a factor 3 to allow use of the @xmath22 statistic .",

    "uncertainties are given at 68% confidence for one interesting parameter .",
    "due to the presence of counts from the galactic ridge within the source extraction region , background spectra were extracted from 3 different source free regions at the same offset in the fov as the source and with the same extraction radius .",
    "each mecs background spectrum contains @xmath11250  counts .",

    "[ fig : spec ] , an f - test reveals that the addition of this feature is only significant at a confidence level of 90% .",
    "a similar line feature is also evident in the mean mecs background spectrum , but with an intensity @xmath110.25 of that above . thus ,",
    "unless the background line intensity varies by a factor @xmath115 on a spatial scale of 15 , the probable line feature is associated with the pulsar .",
    "since the source is partly obscured by the mecs entrance window support structure , a mecs spectrum was extracted with a 2  radius in order to investigate this effect .",
    "the appropriate off - axis response matrix was used .",
    "the fit parameters so derived are consistent with those obtained from the spectra extracted with a 4  radius .",
    "the only significant difference is in the unabsorbed 210  kev flux estimate which increases to @xmath8  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath9 .",
    "this is thus the best estimate of the source intensity .",
    "although  is in the fov of the non - imaging high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( 5120  kev ) and phoswich detector system ( 15300  kev ) instruments , no useful spectral or timing information could be extracted from these data .",
    "we have searched the x - ray catalogs at the heasarc for any previous observations of the region of sky containing .",
    "no previous detections of a source with a position consistent with  are reported .",
    "the two most sensitive observations of the  region were by rxte and rosat .",
    "this region of sky was observed twice by rxte during scans of the galactic plane ( valinia & marshall @xcite ) . from their fig .  1 the upper limit to the strength of any possible point source near  is @xmath1120  pca count  s@xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to a 210 kev flux ( using the bepposax power - law spectral parameters ) of @xmath30  erg  cm  @xmath27  s@xmath9 , which is a factor @xmath1140 greater than the intensity observed by bepposax .    during the rosat all - sky survey the region of sky containing",
    "was observed .",
    "no source at a position consistent with the new pulsar is present in the bright source catalogue with an upper limit of 0.05  count  s@xmath9 ( voges et al .",
    "@xcite ) , corresponding to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath11@xmath31  erg  cm  @xmath27  s@xmath9 , again significantly above the intensity observed here .",
    "however , the rosat count rate to flux conversion depends strongly on the amount of interstellar absorption , which is not well constrained by our observation .",
    "the line of sight towards  intersects the spiral arms of our galaxy at @xmath111.5 , 4 , and 12  kpc .",
    "we have searched the usno - a on - line database for possible optical counterparts .",

    "[ sect : discussion ] ) , the absence of a bright blue star in the bepposax error region indicates that the distance is @xmath76kpc , and probably less than about 12 kpc ( since this is the `` edge '' of the galaxy ) .",
    "this implies a 210  kev luminosity of ( 415)@xmath10  erg  s@xmath9 .",
