    "these huge structures may suggest past large - scaled activities in the galactic center , such as active galactic nucleus ( agn ) jet activity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , non - relativistic outflow from the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or wind driven by supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "note that ms11 adopted steady solutions for the electron energy distribution , while the diffusion coefficient in the momentum space is assumed to decay with time .",
    "in addition , the steady solutions accompany electron escape , but the escaped electrons are neglected in ms11 . the model in @xcite is a different type of model , in which the shock fronts do not play an important role .",
    "our goal is to find the best phenomenological description of the diffusion coefficient evolving in the downstream region rather than probe details of the acceleration mechanism .",

    "the time @xmath50 and the distance from the shock front @xmath51 are connected as @xmath52 ( see figure [ schpic ] ) , then the radial position is written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the shock front .",

    "the deceleration / acceleration of the shock front makes our model complicated , and forces us to ( at least ) a 1d calculation rather than a one - zone approximation . to simplify our model , we assume that the shock speed has not changed drastically in the last period of a few megayears . this assumption is consistent with almost constant shock velocity at the last stage in the prompt energy injection model of @xcite based on the galactic halo profile in @xcite . even in the long energy injection model of @xcite ,",
    "the shock velocity is almost constant after a few megayears from the onset of the energy injection .",
    "the almost constant electron density at a scale of 12 kpc behind the shock in the simulations of @xmath56 myr activity of the galactic nucleus by @xcite also supports our simple assumption indirectly .",

    "consequently , the obtained spectra for electrons and gamma - rays also become similar to those in ms11 .      in model",
    "noe , the filling factor of the drs is simply assumed to be unity .",
    "namely , the turbulence is distributed over the whole fbs . in this case",
    ", there is no effect of electron escape .",
    "once electrons are injected , they are continuously affected by the turbulence .    in figure [ ele3 ]",
    ", we plot the evolution of the electron spectrum .",
    "each time in the figure ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 7.8 myr ) corresponds to the distance from the shock front ( 0.26 , 0.51 , 1.0 , 2.0 kpc , respectively ) .",
    "apparently , the maximum energy of electrons gradually grows with time .",
    "the energy distribution is not the steady - state solution , since the initial acceleration timescale @xmath84 myr , which is independent of electron energy , and the cooling timescale @xmath85 are long enough compared to the elapsed time . the electron spectrum becomes harder with increasing time .",
    "the cooling effect is not so sufficient that the energy density of electrons increases with time or @xmath51 . at later stages ( see the line of 7.8 myr ) , the spectrum becomes similar to the steady solution , in which a spectral bump at @xmath86 ev is formed by the balance of the acceleration and cooling .",
    "as we have mentioned , even if we adopt the same model as ms11 with the escape effect , the time - dependent calculation yields a similar evolution of @xmath57 to that in figure [ ele3 ] .",
    "this is an opposite manner of the spatial dependence of the electron spectrum in ms11 ; the steady solution in ms11 shows a hard - to - soft distribution from the shock front to the downstream .",
    "note that the escape timescale in ms11 is @xmath87@xmath88 myr so that the escape effect can be neglected .",
    "the steady - state solutions may not be appropriate to describe the electron energy distribution .    in our model , the electron spectrum",
    "is maintained hard during the calculation , because the escape effect is neglected . as a result",
    ", the gamma - ray spectrum below 1 gev becomes too hard , as shown in figure [ spe3 ] .",
    "another problem is that the surface brightness monotonically increases as the radius approaches to the center .",
    "as shown in figure [ sur3 ] , the inner boundary at @xmath59 kpc is reflected on the surface brightness as a sharp peak .",
    "unless such an artificial cavity exists , the surface brightness profile should have a peak at the center in this model .",
    "the nearly homogeneous surface brightness is difficult to be reproduced with this model .",
    "the photon spectra and surface brightness obtained by the time - dependent calculation with the same model as ms11 are also similar to figures [ spe3 ] and [ sur3 ] . in order to soften the spectrum , especially for the inner region ,",
    "the escape effect should be incorporated .      to soften the electron and photon spectra ,",
    "the escape effect should be involved . in the mie model , we take into account the escape effect with the initial timescale of @xmath89 myr , which is much longer than @xmath90 myr and the acceleration timescale , 0.48 myr . as time passes , the escape timescale shortens , while the acceleration timescale grows . in figure [ ele1 ] , we show the evolution of the total electron spectrum ( namely , @xmath91 ) . at @xmath92 myr ,",
    "the escape effect is still negligible , so the electrons in the drs still dominate for the entire energy region . even at @xmath93 myr , the peak energy region ( @xmath86 ev ) is dominated by the electrons in the acceleration process .",
    "however , in the low - energy power - law - like region ( below @xmath94 ev ) , the escaped electron density is comparable to that in the drs . at the last stage ( @xmath95 myr )",
    ", the ic cooling makes a spectral peak for the escaped electrons at @xmath94 ev , while the highest energy region ( @xmath86 ev ) is still dominated by the electrons in the drs .",
    "the softening of the electron spectrum due to the ic cooling and escape effects understandably produces a softer gamma - ray spectrum than the noe model spectrum .",
    "as shown in figure [ spe1 ] , the resultant spectrum agrees well with the observation above @xmath96 ev .",
    "the surface brightness profiles also agree with the observed properties : sharp rise at the edge and flat profile inside ( see figure [ sur1 ] ) .    even with the best - fit parameters for the mie model , the radio intensity is far below the observed data of the wmap haze ( see figure [ spe1 ] ) .",
    "while we have assumed @xmath34 , a stronger magnetic field such as 1020 @xmath97 g may be required as shown in ms11 ( see also , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to reconcile the radio intensity .",
    "however , the magnetic field model in @xcite , which agrees with all - sky total intensity and polarization maps , may not allow such a high field .      in this subsection",
    ", we try to find a model that agrees with not only the gamma - ray spectrum but also the wmap haze",
    ". the electron spectrum should be softer than that in the mie model .",
    "we adopt a very small size for @xmath5 in the efe model , so the escape effect will be more prominent . to accelerate electrons as far as @xmath98 ev before escaping from the drs ,",
    "a higher value for @xmath33 is adopted here .",
    "the initial timescales are @xmath99 myr , @xmath100 myr , and @xmath101 myr . at @xmath102 myr ,",
    "the acceleration and escape timescales become comparable as @xmath103 myr . at @xmath104 myr ( see figure [ ele2 ] ) , most electrons above @xmath40 ev are still in the drs .",
    "the escaped electrons become dominant in the later phase ( @xmath105 myr ) . then , the acceleration efficiency quickly damps .",
    "the inefficiency of the acceleration in the later phase is due to not only the escape effect but also the growth of the acceleration timescale .",
    "the non - steady electron spectrum in the early acceleration stage is therefore frozen after the decay of the acceleration efficiency .",
    "this leads to the soft electron spectrum . owing to the fast decay of the acceleration efficiency ,",
    "the electrons injected later almost remain at the injection energy so that an artificial spectral peak is seen at @xmath96 ev .",
    "the spectral cutoff due to the ic cooling ( @xmath106 myr ) is clearly seen in the electron spectra for @xmath107 myr in figure [ ele2 ] .",
    "the resultant photon spectrum becomes so soft that the radio intensity of the wmap haze is also reproduced as seen in figure [ spe2 ] .",
    "the model flux at @xmath96 ev is slightly higher than the observation , but may still be within the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the surface brightness profiles do not seem to deviate from the observed profiles very much ( see figure [ sur2 ] ) , but the short acceleration period makes a slight limb brightening . in this model ,",
    "the initial acceleration timescale is much shorter than the previous models",

    "the acceleration mechanism is common for electrons and protons other than the injection process .",
    "the accelerated protons should obviously exist in the situation we have considered in this paper .",
    "high - energy protons collide with the thermal protons , and produce pions that decay into gamma - rays , which may be responsible for the gamma - ray emission in the fbs . similarly to the leptonic models , we test three models as summarized in table [ para_had ] . the radiative cooling effect is neglected so that the difference between protons in the drs and escaped protons is the acceleration process only .",
    "we adopt @xmath72 again .",
    "the background density of protons as the targets for @xmath1-collision is assumed to be uniform with @xmath117 .    in figure [ gspe_pro ] , we plot the gamma - ray spectra at the center ( @xmath118 ) for the three models . as the escape effect becomes efficient",

    "the time interval in which the maximum electron energy reaches @xmath98 ev is not negligible compared to the bubble expansion timescale .",
    "we also show that the escape effect may be indispensable to reproduce the gamma - ray spectrum especially below 1 gev .",
    "if electrons are continuously accelerated , the electron spectrum becomes too hard to agree with the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "for the escaped electrons , the termination of the acceleration and succeeding cooling effect generate a soft spectrum . the combination of the two electron species , those in the acceleration region and those having escaped , can produce the best - fit model for the fbs .",
    "in addition , the long - term evolution of the electron spectrum , which is regulated by the finite timescales of @xmath70 , @xmath123 , @xmath71 , and @xmath124 , is favorable for the almost constant surface brightness .",
    "moreover , assuming a very short @xmath71 , we can reproduce the spectra of both the fbs and wmap haze with the reasonable magnetic field .    while we can not determine the model parameters uniquely",
    ", our results modestly constrain a parameter range .",
    "if the turbulence decay is much faster than our models , the initial acceleration efficiency should be high .",
    "in such cases , the particle acceleration and gamma - ray emission occur near the shock front only .",
    "this leads to significant limb brightening in the surface brightness profile as seen in the synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons in supernova remnants .",
