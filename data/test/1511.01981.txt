    "neutron capture cross sections are required for the accurate modeling of advanced nuclear energy systems and nucleosynthesis in neutron - rich astrophysical environments .",
    "unfortunately , it is often difficult to accurately measure ( n,@xmath0 ) cross sections for short - lived `` minor '' actinides over the energy range of greatest relevance to nuclear energy and astrophysical applications . in these cases",
    "an alternative approach is to measure the properties of excited nuclear states , including the nuclear level density and @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) , and use these as inputs for calculations of neutron capture reaction rates using statistical model codes . in this paper",
    "we are concentrating on the properties of the n+@xmath2pu compound system .    with a half life of 0.37 million years",
    ", @xmath2pu is the second longest - lived isotope of pu after @xmath8pu .",
    "though its radioactivity is not one of the largest contributors to nuclear waste decay heat , @xmath2pu is fissionable by fast neutrons and can be recycled in fast reactors . with the increase of the fuel cycle length and the development of fast reactors aimed at reducing radioactive waste",
    "comes the need for reliable cross sections for a fast neutron spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is extremely important to be able to accurately predict cross sections where measured data are insufficient or nonexistent .",
    "furthermore , improvements in the modeled reaction rates could also improve predictions of actinide abundances on earth  @xcite .",
    "actinides are synthesized in extreme stellar environments uniquely by the rapid neutron capture process  @xcite .",
    "for accurate predictions , reactions rates for actinides with high neutron excess are the most crucial . however , such actinide isotopes with extreme neutron - to - proton ratios are out of reach experimentally , and will remain so for many years to come .",
    "thus , it is imperative to obtain a better understanding of the fundamental nuclear properties in this mass region , to provide stringent test on nuclear models invoked to calculate these reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the statistical properties of the nucleus are important for nuclear cross section calculations in the framework of the statistical model .",
    "the nuclear level density and @xmath0sf can be extracted using the oslo method  @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully applied recently in the actinide region to the @xmath9th , @xmath10pa , @xmath11u and @xmath12np isotopes  @xcite .",
    "thus far , the level densities of all measured actinides follow closely the constant - temperature level density formula . these heavy and well deformed systems also show a low energy orbital @xmath13 scissors resonance ( sr ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to extract the level density and @xmath0sf in @xmath1pu . comparing the measured to an estimated @xmath0sf",
    ", the sr is extracted and interpreted as an enhancement of the @xmath0sf .",

    "iv , the experimental sr is presented and theoretical sum rules are briefly introduced .",
    "extracted resonance parameters are compared to previous results and sum - rules estimates . in sec .",

    "the experiment was conducted using the mc-35 scanditronix cyclotron at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) .",
    "the 0.4 mg/@xmath15 @xmath2pu on a be - backing target was bombarded with a 12  mev deuteron beam with a beam current of @xmath16  1  na .",
    "prior to electrodeposition , the pu material was cleaned from decay products and other impurities using an anion - exchange resin column procedure  @xcite .",
    "the purified product was electroplated onto a thin be foil ( 1.9 mg/@xmath15 thickness ) from a small aliquot of dilute nitric acid placed into a large volume of isopropanol .",
    "the resulting target was dried , baked at @xmath17c in a muffle furnace , then glued to the target frame .",
    "particle-@xmath0 coincidences were measured using the siri particle telescope and the cactus @xmath0-detector system  @xcite .",
    "the siri particle telescope is composed of eight segmented si particle telescopes , which in this experiment were placed at backward angles of @xmath18 to @xmath19 relative to the beam axis , drastically reducing the contribution from elastically scattered deuterons .",
    "the resulting spin distribution of the nucleus is more representative of the compound nuclei formed in higher - energy ( e.g. , non - thermal ) ( n,@xmath20 ) reactions .",
    "each telescope is comprised of a @xmath21e and e si detector with thicknesses of @xmath22  @xmath23 m and @xmath24  @xmath23 m , respectively .",
    "the cactus array consists of 26 collimated @xmath25 nai(tl ) detectors surrounding the target and particle telescopes , and with a total efficiency of @xmath26(2)@xmath27 at @xmath28  mev .",
    "the particle telescopes were used to generate the master gate signal and the start signal for the time - to - digital - converters ( tdc ) .",
    "the nai detectors were used as individual tdc stops .",
    "thus prompt particle-@xmath0 coincidences with background subtraction were sorted event by event .",
    "the proton events were extracted by setting proper two - dimensional gates on the @xmath21e - e matrices . using the measured proton energies deposited in the telescopes and the reaction q value , the initial excitation energy @xmath29 in the residual @xmath1pu nucleus was calculated . to avoid contamination from @xmath0-rays emitted by other reaction channels , only excitation energies below the fission barrier",
    "( @xmath30  mev  @xcite ) and the neutron separation energy ( @xmath31  mev  @xcite ) were considered .",

    "<S> the level density and @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) of @xmath1pu have been measured in the quasi - continuum using the oslo method . </S>",
    "<S> excited states in @xmath1pu were populated using the @xmath2pu@xmath3 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the level density closely follows the constant - temperature level density formula for excitation energies above the pairing gap . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0sf displays a double - humped resonance at low energy as also seen in previous investigations of actinide isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the structure is interpreted as the scissors resonance and has a centroid of @xmath4  mev and a total strength of @xmath5  @xmath6 , which is in excellent agreement with sum - rule estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the measured level density and @xmath0sf were used to calculate the @xmath2pu@xmath7 cross section in a neutron energy range for which there were previously no measured data . </S>"
