    "examining the earliest phases of low mass stellar evolution requires observations of protostars deeply embedded in the dense cores of nearby molecular clouds . these `` class i '' sources ( @xcite ) have blackbody - like spectral energy distributions that peak at wavelengths of 30100  and bolometric luminosities , @xmath1 0.1100  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . despite many detailed studies of their circumstellar environments ( see , for example , @xcite , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , understanding the stellar physics of these objects",
    "has proved elusive .",
    "comparisons of observed bolometric luminosity functions with models is straightforward but controversial ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1994b ) .",
    "the apparent lack of photospheric features in many objects has led several groups to abandon the hr diagram as a means for testing stellar evolutionary tracks of the youngest stars .",
    "these groups have proposed the bolometric temperature ( @xcite and references therein ) , the submillimeter flux ( @xcite ) , and the visual extinction ( @xcite ) to replace effective temperature and have developed models to place evolving pre ",
    "main - sequence stars in their modified evolutionary diagrams .",
    "the accuracy of these techniques remains uncertain , because the methods are new and incompletely tested .    in this paper , we report an optical spectroscopic survey designed to detect photospheric absorption features from the central stars of class i sources in the taurus - auriga cloud .",
    "although the line - of - sight extinction to the central star is large , @xmath2 3060 mag ( @xcite ) , large ground - based telescopes can detect optical light scattered off cavities in the infalling envelopes of many objects .",
    "optical data also provide the best measure of spectral types for pre  main - sequence stars .",
    "in general , i - band and j - band data are least contaminated by emission from an accretion disc and its associated boundary layer or magnetic accretion column ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the very large continuum veiling detected on near - ir spectra of some class i sources ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1996b ) favors i - band spectra , because the j - band veiling can be large if the disc extends to the stellar photosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , optical spectra of class i sources allow an unambiguous comparison with optically brighter t tauri stars , which have known spectral types in a well - calibrated system ( see , for example , kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; kh95 hereafter ) .",
    "our results provide the first optical detection of m - type absorption features in an embedded protostar .",
    "we identify tio absorption bands in three taurus - auriga class i sources ; one other star may have tio features and a fifth star may have k - type absorption features .",
    "we use optical spectra of t tauri stars to calibrate the spectral types of class i sources and then construct a complete hr diagram for the taurus - auriga cloud .",
    "these data , coupled with new evolutionary tracks for protostars accreting from discs and two spectral types derived from near - ir spectra ( @xcite ) , show that class i sources in taurus - auriga mingle with t tauri stars and lie below the birthline in the hr diagram .",
    "we also detect strong emission lines on the spectra of all protostars . forbidden emission from [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] is much more common among class i sources than older , optically brighter stars having the same bolometric luminosity .",
    "the fluxes of forbidden emission lines also seem stronger among class i sources than other pre  main - sequence stars in the cloud .",
    "we find no evidence that the permitted emission lines , such as h@xmath0 and he  i , are more common or stronger than in t tauri stars .",
    "these results extend and confirm previous conclusions that jet activity declines as a pre  main - sequence star contracts to the main - sequence .",

    "practically all class i sources have molecular outflows ; very few optically visible t tauri stars are associated with molecular outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in their complete survey of taurus class",

    "optical jet emission is almost always associated with classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) instead of weak - emission t tauri stars ( wtts ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared surveys also indicate more emission line activity among class i sources than ctts or wtts ( @xcite , 1996b ) .",
    "these results suggest that jet emission is correlated with disc accretion and that disc accretion somehow declines from class i sources to t tauri stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to examine these correlations with our spectroscopic data , we divide sources into classes based on the ratio of far - infrared to bolometric luminosity , @xmath22 ( kh95 ) . in this system ,",

    "the frequency of [ s  ii ] emission obviously increases with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "we find a similarly striking trend for [ n  ii ] emission : practically all class i sources have strong [ n  ii ] but only a few ctts or wtts have any [ n  ii ] emission .",
    "our detection frequencies for forbidden - line emission are lower limits , because we can not detect weak emission lines with ew @xmath8 0.20.4   ( see tables 12 ) .",
    "to estimate the importance of this uncertainty , we compare our results with hartigan ( 1995 ) who derive emission line equivalent widths from echelle spectra . at higher resolution ,",
    "the detection frequency for [ s  ii ] emission increases to @xmath5 50% for ctts and remains unchanged at 0% for wtts .",
    "the [ n  ii ] emission shows a similar trend but is detected less often than [ s  ii ] .",
    "hartigan note , however , that the forbidden emission lines in ctts consist of high velocity material from the jet and low velocity gas near the disc .",
    "the weak , low velocity emission is responsible for the larger [ s  ii ] detection frequency among ctts in the hartigan sample .",
    "our low resolution spectra do not detect this emission and thus provide a proper estimate for the frequency of high velocity jet emission among ctts .    to check further the reality of the trend in figure 7",

    "this result is not as strong as for the [ s  ii ] lines , because weak [ n  ii ] emission is more difficult to detect due to the strong h@xmath0 lines in many ctts .    we conclude that the increasing frequency of forbidden line emission as a function of @xmath22 is real .",
    "sources with large @xmath22 are much more likely to be associated with forbidden line emission than sources with small @xmath22 . in addition , our sample is large enough to detect a significant difference in the frequency of [ s  ii ] emission between ctts and wtts .",

    "if accretion ceases at any time , the star will shrink down to the main - sequence along a normal pre  main - sequence track and will ignite and burn deuterium on the way if it has not already done so .    in our accretion models ,",
    "the deuterium burning sequence defines a stellar birthline in the hr diagram .",
    "previous calculations find similar results .",
    "stahler ( 1983 , 1988 ; see also @xcite , 1993 ) first identified the birthline for spherical accretion and showed that this locus provides a good upper envelope for observations of young stars in nearby molecular clouds .",
    "mercer - smith ( 1984 ) published the first hr diagram track for a disc - accreting protostar using a code similar in spirit to the eggleton code .",
    "hartmann ( 1997 ) later derived a birthline for disc accretion from semi - analytic calculations .",
    "our deuterium burning sequence lies close to stahler s ( 1983 , 1988 ) birthline for log @xmath62 3.55 and falls @xmath63 log @xmath64 0.10.2 below the birthline for log @xmath65 3.55 .",
    "the displacement reflects differences in the starting conditions and outer boundary condition .",
    "the birthlines converge at large @xmath66 , because the boundary conditions become less important as the stellar luminosity increases ( see also @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "the location of the stellar birthline in our models is sensitive to the adopted deuterium abundance .",
    "this behavior follows from the explicit dependence of the stellar luminosity on the rate of deuterium burning ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our deuterium burning sequence shifts by @xmath63 log @xmath64 @xmath670.13 for a factor of two reduction in @xmath68 .",
    "our birthline then roughly coincides with that of hartmann ( 1997 ) for @xmath69 .    with only six class i sources in our hr diagram , it is difficult for the data to favor convincingly any theoretical calculation .",
    "the 2@xmath43 error bars are consistent with all of the tracks , even without considering uncertainties in the model input parameters .",
    "the data lie closer to the disc - accretion birthline of hartmann ( 1997 ) and our deuterium burning sequence than either the birthline for spherical accretion or the accretion track of mercer - smith ( 1984 ) . in all cases , changing model input parameters  such as the deuterium abundance",
    " would allow a better match between data and the models .",
    "more rigorous comparisons thus await observational estimates of unknown quantities such as the deuterium abundance and a larger sample of class i sources with reliable spectral types and luminosities .",
    "we conclude this section with several points about the comparison of observations with model tracks .",
    "first , the distribution of class i sources about _ any _ birthline should be uniform , if the range in initial conditions is small . this dispersion should be comparable to the observational errors . in our case , 5 out of 6 class i sources fall 12@xmath43 below the birthline for spherical accretion ( @xcite , 1988 ) and the mercer - smith ( 1984 ) accretion track .",
    "the data are somewhat more consistent with our deuterium burning sequence and the hartmann ( 1997 ) birthline for an accretion rate of @xmath70 . a larger sample of class i sources should distinguish between models .",
    "second , it is important to compare the _ stellar _ component of the protostellar luminosity with the predictions of model tracks . the observed class i luminosities are the _ total _ luminosity and have not been corrected for the unknown amount of accretion luminosity . in most of the ctts shown in figure 8 , the accretion luminosity is a small fraction ",
    "10% to 30%  of the stellar luminosity plotted in the figure ( see @xcite , 1995 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the accretion luminosity is roughly comparable to the stellar luminosity in the continuum + emission sources and is @xmath5 100 times the stellar luminosity in fu ori systems like l1551 irs5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we expect a small accretion contribution for class i sources with optical spectra similar to most ctts , although the accretion luminosity in l1489 irs may be large ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the arrow in fig .",
    "8 indicates the displacement in log @xmath66 for a @xmath63 log @xmath71 = @xmath670.1 change in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this change moves the data closer to both the birthline for spherical accretion and our deuterium sequence and illustrates the difficulty in comparing models with current data .",
    "third , knowledge of the deuterium abundance , and to a lesser extent the lithium abundance , is also necessary to compare observations with model predictions .",
    "the mean deuterium abundance for stars in a molecular cloud sets the location of the birthline in the hr diagram ; any star - to - star scatter in the abundance spreads the birthline vertically in the hr diagram . to our knowledge , the deuterium abundance has not been measured in any pre ",
    "main - sequence star .",
    "recent measurements indicate a factor of 35 scatter in the lithium abundance among nearby molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that could be due actual abundance differences between stars ( see @xcite ) or differences in the analysis procedures ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". observations of older open clusters may also indicate considerable star - to - star differences in the rate of lithium depletion among stars with the same mass ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar spreads in the deuterium burning rate , due perhaps to star - to - star variations in accretion rate , further complicates the comparison of observations with model tracks .",
    "the sample of protostars is not currently large enough to worry about abundance variations , but the uncertainties will become more important as sample sizes increase .",
    "in the previous sections , we have described the first optical spectroscopic survey of class i , embedded sources in a single molecular cloud . we supplemented these data with high quality optical spectra of a representative sample of older and optically brighter t tauri stars .",
    "the combined set of spectra show that the optical spectra of class i sources qualitatively resemble the optical spectra of t tauri stars .",
    "our analysis further reveals common physical properties and substantial differences between class i sources and t tauri stars , as summarized below .",
    "our data provide the first indication that the distribution of stellar spectral types among class i sources may not be very different from that of wtts and ctts . of the five class i sources with strong optical continua ,",
    "one ( l1489 irs ) is a continuum + emission source , three are m - type stars , and another ( 04264 + 2433 ) may have an m - type central star . to the best of our knowledge , _ these are the first low mass protostars with measured optical spectral types .",
    "_ this sample is too small for a meaningful comparison with the distribution of spectral types among more evolved pre ",
    "main - sequence stars in the cloud .",
    "we note , however , that the median spectral type for wtts and ctts is k7-m0 and that the frequency of continuum + emission sources is @xmath5 5%10% ( kh95 ) .",
    "published observations indicate other similarities between class i sources and older pre  main - sequence stars in taurus - auriga .",
    "first , class i sources have the same intrinsic near - ir colors as do ctts .",
    "whitney ( 1997 ) show that the observed near - ir colors of class i sources can be modeled as a ctts surrounded by an infalling envelope with an optical extinction , @xmath2 3060 mag .",
    "this analysis leads to the conclusion that the radiation from the star and inner disc of a class i source is similar to that of a t tauri star ( see also @xcite ; calvet 1997 reach a different conclusion ) .",
    "second , the bolometric luminosity distributions of class i sources , ctts , and wtts are indistinguishable ( kh95 ) .",
    "all three groups of pre  main - sequence stars have median luminosities of @xmath72 0.50.8 .",
    "this unexpected result is supported by the positions of class i sources in the hr diagram .",
    "our data show that class i sources have luminosities and effective temperatures very similar to those of ctts and wtts in the cloud .",
    "these conclusions are surprising , because a class i source should have a larger luminosity once it has accreted nearly all of its final mass , and this luminosity should decline with time as the star approaches the main sequence ( see , for example , @xcite , 1988 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; fig .",
    "8) . the current sample , however , is too small to test stellar models in detail .",
    "the errors in luminosity and effective temperature are also too large .",
    "observations with the next generation of ground - based telescopes will undoubtedly expand the sample , reduce the errors , and provide better tests of protostellar accretion theory .",
    "one feature that distinguishes class i sources is their strong forbidden - line emission . as a group ,",
    "class i sources are much more likely to have forbidden - line emission than ctts or wtts ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "this result confirms previous conclusions from imaging data ( e.g. , @xcite ) and indicates that class i sources are more likely to drive outflows than ctts or wtts ( see also @xcite ; @xcite , 1994 ) . the equivalent widths of the forbidden lines are also larger in class i sources than in ctts or wtts .",
    "although some large equivalent widths may be due to very weak optical continua , the [ s  ii ] equivalent widths in hh31 irs2  a class i source with a prominent tio absorption band  are larger than observed in _ any _ ctts in our sample ( see tables 12 ) .",
    "deeper optical spectra of our sample and other class i sources would clarify this point .",
    "our sample is not large enough to test whether class i sources also have more prominent _ permitted _ emission lines than ctts .",
    "the median h@xmath0 equivalent width for class i sources , @xmath5 90  , is much larger than the median equivalent width for ctts , @xmath5 3040  .",
    "this difference is roughly what we expect",
    "if class i sources have larger continuum veiling than ctts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and if the h@xmath0 equivalent width correlates with veiling ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the frequency of he  i @xmath95876 , 6678 emission among class i sources is roughly comparable to that among ctts .",
    "we measure a he  i emission frequency of 50% among 6 class i sources with reasonable signal - to - noise at 6000  , 57% among 14 flat - spectrum sources , and 65% among 46 class ii sources . for both emission lines ,",
    "the class i sample is probably biased against small equivalent widths , because class i sources without emission lines are probably fainter than sources with emission lines . a deeper survey with a larger telescope",
    "could enlarge the sample of class i sources with high quality optical spectra .",
    "these data would provide a good test for differences in the distribution of h@xmath0 equivalent widths between class i sources and ctts .",
    "these results fit into the general picture of taurus - auriga class i sources developed in kh95 and in kenyon ( 1990 ) . in this picture ,",
    "class i sources are envelopes of gas and dust falling into the central star - disc system at rates of a few @xmath73 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite , 1993b ; @xcite ) .",
    "bell & lin ( 1994 ) show that the stable accretion rate through the disc onto the central star is either very low ",
    "@xmath8 a few @xmath74  or very high ",
    "@xmath11 a few @xmath75  compared to the infall rate .",
    "the disc spends most of its time in the low accretion rate state ; the disc mass then slowly increases with time until it reaches a critical level and evolves to the high accretion rate state .",
    "this model explains the low observed luminosities of nearly all class i sources as well as the occasional high luminosity of a source such as l1551 irs5 .",
    "models with time - dependent disc accretion also qualitatively account for the evolution of forbidden and permitted emission lines in pre  main - sequence stars .",
    "we expect the time - averaged accretion rate through the disc to decline as the envelope disperses .",
    "if the h@xmath0 and other permitted emission lines of class i sources form in the accretion region of the inner disc as in ctts , then the median h@xmath0 equivalent width should decline as a pre  main sequence star evolves from a class i source into a ctts and then into a wtts .",
    "most models for jet formation link the mass loss rate in the jet to the mass accretion rate through the disc ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1994b ) , so we expect forbidden emission to decline as well . explaining the observations of emission line equivalent widths with a quantitative model of a dispersing envelope and evolving disc , however , is currently beyond our reach .",
    "finally , our results further demonstrate the advantages of optical spectra .",
    "recent surveys of larger samples of class i sources using near - ir spectroscopy have yielded only two spectral types each in taurus - auriga ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath76 oph ( @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "casali & eiroa ( 1996 ; see also @xcite ; @xcite , 1997 ) conclude that continuum emission from dust in a circumstellar disc or envelope veils photospheric absorption features on near - ir spectra of class i sources .",
    "preliminary results further suggest that this veiling is larger in class i sources than in ctts or wtts ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "dust emission is much weaker relative to a normal stellar photosphere at shorter wavelengths , @xmath77 m , so optical spectra may yet provide the best measure of spectral types in class i sources .",
    "6ex we thank the staffs of the mmt , palomar , and whipple observatories for assistance with our observations .",
    "fred chaffee kindly acquired several spectra of the class ii sources listed in table 1 .",
    "susan tokarz reduced the fast spectra and graciously assisted with the reduction of the mmt and palomar spectra .",
    "we also thank m. geller , m. gmez , c. lada , a. mahdavi , and b. whitney for advice and comments .",
