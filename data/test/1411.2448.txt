    "due to its high curie temperature and strong magnetic anisotropy , mnbi has attracted increasing attention in the pursuit of rare - earth - free permanent magnets ( see for example the review by poudyal and liu @xcite ) .",
    "advances in the understanding of the properties and processing of this material continue , despite its relatively simple , nias - type crystal structure , and the fact that ferromagnetism in mnbi was first reported over a century ago @xcite .",
    "key early studies were preformed by guillaud @xcite . in the 1950 s ,",
    "this material was considered as a candidate to replace permanent magnets containing cobalt and nickel , and an energy product of 4.3 mgoe was achieved in the resulting `` bismanol '' magnets @xcite .",
    "subsequently , energy products as high as 7.7 mgoe have been reported @xcite .",
    "mnbi has several promising aspects as a candidate replacement for rare earth magnets .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) relatively inexpensive components @xcite , ( 2 ) high ordered moment and saturation magnetization of 0.58 ma m@xmath1 or about 3.5 @xmath2 per mn at room temperature @xcite , ( 3 ) ferromagnetism that persists to 630 k ( about 40 k higher than nd@xmath3fe@xmath4b ) @xcite , ( 4 ) large and uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy near 1 mj m@xmath5 at room temperature ( moments along the c - axis ) , which increases upon heating above room temperature @xcite .",
    "the observed increase in magnetic anisotropy and coercivity with increasing temperature is perhaps the most interesting , unique , and potentially important property of mnbi .",
    "the ferromagnetism in mnbi vanishes abruptly upon heating above 630 k @xcite .",
    "importantly , the phase transition that occurs near 630 k is not a typical magnetic transition .",
    "this is not technically the curie temperature , and the transition is not directly driven by magnetism .",
    "this transitions has been identified as a peritectic decomposition of mnbi .",
    "heikes noted that the decomposition products contain a ferromagnetic phase with a curie temperature well below the decomposition temperature of mnbi @xcite .",
    "it has since been determined that near 630 k mnbi decomposes into mn@xmath6bi and bi @xcite , both of which are paramagnetic at this temperature .",
    "the mn rich phase is an orthorhombic variant of the nias - structure with the excess mn occupying trigonal prismatic interstices similar to those occupied by the bi atoms @xcite . since mnbi is ferromagnetic and the decomposition products are paramagnetic ( at the peritectic temperature ) , application of strong magnetic field has been shown to stabilize mnbi to higher temperatures , up to about 650 k in a 10 tesla magnetic field @xcite",
    ".    synthesis of high quality single phase samples and in particular large single crystals of mnbi is complicated by the peritectic nature of this reaction , the relatively low temperature at which it occurs ( 630 k ) , and the nearness to the eutectic temperature ( 535 k ) .",
    "mnbi can be grown from a melt with excess bi , as first described by adams et al .",
    "@xcite by cooling the melt in a magnetic field , textured composites with coaligned mnbi crystallites embedded in a bi matrix have been obtained and studied @xcite . for permanent magnet applications ,",
    "fine - grained , polycrystalline samples are usually desired .",
    "these have been produced from melt - spun and/or mechanically milled material @xcite , and by magnetic separation of mnbi from excess bi in samples produced by powder - metallurgical routes @xcite .",
    "magnetic measurements show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of mnbi passes through zero and the coercivity of mnbi powders vanishes near 90 k @xcite .",
    "these observations are associated with the reorientation of the mn magnetic moment from parallel to perpendicular to the crystallographic c - axis upon cooling .",
    "the spin reorientation temperature , @xmath0 , denotes the temperature at which magnetic moment develops a c - component upon heating and the coercivity begins to increase .",
    "the rotation of the moments has been oberved in neutron diffraction from mnbi powders @xcite and also nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the nmr results from powders @xcite and magnetization measurements on single crystals @xcite show the rotation away from the _",
    "c_-axis upon cooling begins near 140 k , increases gradually upon further cooing to @xmath0 = 90 k , and then abruptly completes , with the moment flopping discontinuously into the _ ab_-plane .",
    "however , neutron diffraction from mnbi powder suggests the moments are not fully in - plane below 90 k @xcite .    in the presence of significant magneto - elastic coupling , a response in the crystal lattice to the reorientation of the magnetic moments",
    "is expected .",
    "signatures of this coupling have been reported in the temperature dependence of the lattice constants of mnbi @xcite . while the hexagonal nias structure type describes the powder x - ray diffraction results at all temperatures , anomalies in both",
    "the a and c lattice parameters occur at temperatures near the spin reorientation .",
    "recent first - principles calculations have reproduced these magneto - elastic effects , and linked the spin - reorientation to anisotropic thermal expansion @xcite , and in particular to resulting changes in the anisotropic pairwise exchange interactions between bi p - states @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental studies performed on mnbi to date have used polycrystalline material .",
    "single crystals are better suited for the detailed study of intrinsic and anisotropic properties . here",
    "we report the results of our detailed investigation of the structural and physical properties of single crystal mnbi , including x - ray and neutron diffraction , magnetization , heat capacity , and electrical resistivity measurements .",
    "in addition to elucidating the intrinsic properties of mnbi , we find significant differences between the behavior of the single crystals and the reported behavior of polycrystalline mnbi in the literature , in particular regarding the spin reorientation .",
    "our x - ray diffraction results reveal a symmetry - lowering structural distortion occurs at @xmath0 , and suggest that mnbi adopts an orthorhombic structure at low temperature , similar to mn@xmath6bi but without the excess interstitial mn .",
    "this transition is extremely sensitive to strain , and is not observed in powders gently ground from the crystals .",
    "the structure change is accompanied by a thermal anomaly which responds strongly to applied magnetic field , and a sharp decrease in electrical resistivity .",
    "examination of the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters determined from neutron diffraction analysis shows that the bi vibrations along the @xmath7-axis are enhanced with increasing temperature above the spin reorientation , suggesting a relationship with the well - documented increase in magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy with temperature .",

    "in particular , the calculated anisotropy is strongly dependent on _ a_. when the value of _ a _ used in the calculations is increased , the preferred direction of the magnetic moment switches from in the _ ab_-plane to along the _ c_-axis .",

    "the in - plane component of the moment is along the _ a_-axis .",
    "the magnetic structure with the in - plane components has a lower symmetry ( orthorhombic ) than that used to describe the nuclear structure ( hexagonal ) .",
    "therefore , three equivalent magnetic domains , generated by rotations of 120 degrees about the @xmath7-axis , are expected in the large single crystal used for this study .",
    "these domains , equally weighted , were used in the refinements of the neutron data . below the structure transition at 90 k",
    ", each magnetic domain can be uniquely related to an orthorhombic structure domain , and the moment along the [ 100]/[010]/[110 ] directions in the hexagonal description aligns along the _ a_-axis of the orthorhombic lattice of each structural domain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xray]d ) .",
    "because of this domain formation , we expect little effect on the magnetic structure refinement to arise from use of hexagonal symmetry at low temperature .",
    "previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the completeness of the spin rotation at low temperatures , with some finding partial rotation @xcite , and other full rotation @xcite .",
    "our results show that in mnbi single crystals , the rotation is complete .",
    "the observation of only partial rotation in powder samples may be related to the sensitivity of this material to strain . as noted above",
    ", the structural phase transition observed at @xmath0 is suppressed with only a small amount of mechanical stress ( gentle grinding ) .",
