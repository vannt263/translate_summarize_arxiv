    "liquid state theory experienced remarkable successes in the understanding of the properties of dense , simple fluids @xcite and more recently , of complex liquids , like colloidal suspensions or globular polymers @xcite .",
    "however a fully quantitative description of phase transitions can not be obtained by standard integral equations or diagrammatic expansions and requires specially devised approaches .",
    "the freezing transition , often dominated by geometrical constraints , is usually understood on the basis of density functional theory @xcite , while fluctuation induced phenomena , like the liquid - vapour transition , need the completely different theoretical framework provided by the renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical reference theory of fluids ( hrt ) was formulated more than 25 years ago as an attempt to reconcile the renormalization group ( rg ) approach , an extremely general and successful theory of second order phase transitions formulated in field - theoretical language , and the microscopic point of view adopted within liquid state theory @xcite .",
    "the main goal of hrt was to develop a unified theory able to reproduce the universal properties at the critical point , as obtained by rg techniques , together with the non universal features of realistic models of fluids , present both in the critical region ( e.g. critical density and temperature , short range correlations ) as well as far from the critical point .",
    "a comprehensive presentation of the hrt formalism , including a detailed derivation of the basic equations and an extensive discussion of its critical properties , can be found in ref .",
    "the earliest applications of hrt to simple fluids and to the ising model are briefly discussed in the same reference .",
    "however , most of the more interesting results and extensions were developed later . by now",
    "it is therefore appropriate to summarize the advances in hrt which took place in the last decade , providing a guidance to the most significant recent applications .",
    "such a critical discussion of the hrt formalism also gives the opportunity to emphasize its relationship with other theoretical tools which have been independently developed in different frameworks .",
    "since the early nineties , sophisticated functional , non perturbative rg techniques ( nprg ) were devised within field theory , leading to a boost of applications to many and diverse physical situations : from particle physics , to quantum many body theory , to classical statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "only recently it was recognized that , despite the different language and physical context , a deep relation ties hrt and nprg @xcite , whose developments have proceeded quite independently for 20 years in distinct scientific communities .",
    "to introduce the hierarchical reference theory of fluids it is convenient to refer to a system of @xmath0 classical particles confined in a volume @xmath1 , in spatial dimension @xmath2 , interacting via a pairwise potential @xmath3 .",
    "generalizations to classical spin systems , quantum fluids and magnets do not present additional difficulties and will be examined in the next sections . the grand canonical partition function @xmath4 of the model",

    "@xcite via diagrammatic methods @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief introduction of the physical content of the method together with a simpler , less technical derivation .    since the pioneering works by van der waals , a large part of liquid state theory is based on the idea that the strongly repulsive short range interaction , distinctive of the interatomic potentials , provides a constraint to the available phase space , determining an important contribution to the entropy of the fluid , while the mainly attractive , regular part of @xmath3 dominates the internal energy .",
    "this is certainly true for the special , although prototypical , case in which @xmath3 has hard core at short distances , but holds also in the general case of soft core potentials .",
    "the different role played by the singular and regular contributions to the interparticle potential is manifest in lattice gas models , where particles live on the sites of a lattice : hard core repulsion between particles gives rise to the single occupancy constraint , which allows to map the lattice gas onto an ising model with a spin - spin interaction proportional to the regular part of the interparticle potential .",
    "mean field approaches developed for specific models , like van der waals equation in simple fluids or weiss theory in magnets , suggest that only the latter interaction triggers the order parameter fluctuations , responsible for the order - disorder transitions .    in fluid models , both the singular and the regular part contributions are included in the interaction @xmath3 which",
    "should then be split in a reference , singular , part @xmath12 and in the regular remainder @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite as an attempt to apply the renormalization group ideas to microscopic models .",

    "the total correlation function can be conveniently expressed in terms of the direct correlation function @xmath52 by use of the ornstein - zernike relation : @xmath53 the limit @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ wqsmooth ] ) requires some care , as already recognized in the description of the sharp cut - off hrt equation and also discussed in field theoretical approaches @xcite , because of the emergence of a discontinuity in @xmath55 precisely on the same surface @xmath56 where the @xmath57-function singularity develops in @xmath58 .",
    "such a discontinuity originates from the random phase contribution to the exact direct correlation function , being the single term where the regular part of the potential appears outside any integration .",

    "hrt then provides the exact evolution of the free energy in terms of the two body correlation function @xmath73 ( or equivalently @xmath71 ) whose flow is determined by similar equations involving the three and four particle correlations @xcite .",

    "in particular it was shown that close to a critical point , in the long wave - length limit the full hrt hierarchy precisely reproduces the flow equations for the one particle irreducible rg generator @xcite .",

    "( [ leg ] ) it is clear that the average action coincides with the modified free energy defined in hrt : @xmath97 , providing the link between hrt , based on the gradual inclusion of the fourier components of the regular part of the physical interaction , and the  effective average action \" rg method built upon the idea of adding a cut - off and momentum dependent mass term @xmath98 to the original action . from eq .",

    "most of the applications of hrt , both in the smooth and sharp cut - off formulations , adopted a non perturbative closure to the first equation of the hierarchy ( [ smooth],[sharp ] ) and only this type of approximation will be discussed here .",
    "non perturbative closures in fact allow to preserve the convexity of the free energy , providing a physically satisfactory description of phase transitions between homogeneous phases , together with a picture of the critical region fully consistent with the scaling hypothesis .",

    "<S> the foundations of hrt are briefly reviewed in a self - consistent formulation which includes both the original sharp cut - off procedure and the smooth cut - off implementation , which has been recently investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the critical properties of hrt are summarized , together with the behavior of the theory at first order phase transitions </S>",
    "<S> . however , the emphasis of this presentation is on the close relationship between hrt and non perturbative renormalization group methods , as well as on recent generalizations of hrt to microscopic models of interest in soft matter and quantum many body physics . </S>"
