    "recently , negative index materials ( nims ) and photonic crystals ( pcs ) are receiving more and more attention because of their extraordinary optical properties such as near field focusing , subwavelength imaging , and negative refraction .",
    "@xcite as first proposed , these nims have the permittivity , @xmath0 , and the permeability , @xmath1 , simultaneously negative , which are achieved by overlapping electric and magnetic resonances .",
    "but the double resonance scheme also causes large resonance losses and technical difficulties in design and fabrication .",
    "in addition to negative index materials , both theoretical and experimental studies show the properties of negative refraction and subwavelength imaging can also occur in some uniaxially anisotropic media , which can have lower losses and be easier to fabricate .",
    "@xcite    for a particular anisotropic medium , where the permittivity component ( @xmath2 ) along the direction perpendicular to the interface is negative ,",
    "while all other permittivity and permeability components are positive , it has a hyperbolic dispersion relation as follows : @xmath3 where the definitions for @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic_illustration](b ) . figure  [ schematic_illustration](a )",
    "schematically shows how negative refraction works in this particular anisotropic medium .",
    "the group velocity can be calculated by @xmath7 , which implies that the direction of group velocity ( energy flow ) would be normal to the equifrequency surface ( efs ) and in the direction where @xmath8 is increasing .",
    "the conservation of @xmath6 indicates two possible solutions in the medium , but the correct one can be determined by causality  the refracted group velocity should point away from the interface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic_illustration](a ) . from fig .",
    "[ schematic_illustration](a ) , we can also see that for an isotropic medium , the circular equifrequency surface forces the refracted phase and group velocities to lie in the same line  antiparallel for a negative index medium , while parallel for a positive index medium . for an anisotropic medium with a hyperbolic dispersion relation , they do not lie in the same line any more except for the case when @xmath9 . to be normal to the hyperbolic curves and satisfy the requirement of pointing away from the interface coming from the causality",
    ", the refracted group velocity has to undergo a negative refraction , which causes the expected focusing .",
    "( note that the refracted phase velocity for an anisotropic medium still has a positive refraction . )",
    "a lot of work has been done in anisotropic metamaterials , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite liu and zhang @xcite derived the hyperbolic dispersion only theoretically in the maxwell - garnett approximation .",
    "although they showed negative refraction and pseudo focusing in numerical simulations , they did not obtain the actual dispersion relation from the realistic simulated metamaterial nor did they demonstrate the effective medium behavior from realistic simulations . there is a need to demonstrate that the hyperbolic dispersion survives all the way up to the evanescent waves , which is essential for potential super - resolution .",
    "silveirinha et al .",
    ", @xcite apart from analytical calculations , also did not demonstrate the hyperbolic dispersion of the simulated metamaterial .",
    "they only showed the near - field imaging ( channeling ) , which occurs for the special case of a very flat dispersion .",
    "yao et al .",
    "@xcite did experimental work ( negative refraction for small angles only and no dispersion relation was obtained from the experiments ) , and wangberg et al . @xcite presented analytical work based on the maxwell - garnett approximation .",
    "most of the previous theoretical and numerical work on anisotropic metamaterials is done on homogeneous materials , where the hyperbolic dispersion relation given by eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) is used .    in this paper",
    ", we use realistic simulations for three - dimensional ( 3d ) wire media and metal - dielectric superlattices to establish directly that the hyperbolic dispersion relation is valid up to evanescent modes in the long - wavelength limit and then retrieve the effective permittivity .",
    "a fitting procedure is exploited to get the dispersion relation from the field distributions obtained from full - wave numerical simulations of realistic structures .",
    "the imaging for a homogeneous slab with the effective permittivity shows very good agreement with the realistic structure .",
    "( all simulations about this homogeneous effective anisotropic medium are done by comsol multiphysics , an electromagnetic ( em ) solver based on the finite element method . )",
    "we have three significant contributions to the field of anisotropic metamaterials : ( 1 ) the numerically obtained dispersion relations , ( 2 ) the demonstration of the effective medium behavior that works with evanescent incident modes and ( 3 ) our unique method to obtain the dispersion relations , different from the usual retrieval procedure based on inverting the scattering amplitudes .",
    "before discussing our results on 3d wire media , simulations are performed for a superlattice of metallic layers with @xmath10 and air layers with @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic_illustration](b ) .",
    "these simulations are done to check the applicability of our idea that one can obtain negative refraction and focusing in anisotropic media .",

    "[ 2dfocusing](c ) .",
    "the focusing simulation is compared with the ray - tracing diagram ( fig .  [ 2dfocusing](b ) ) and the imaging of a homogeneous anisotropic slab with the effective permittivity extracted from the dispersion relation of the metallic - air superlattice ( fig .  [ 2dfocusing](d ) ) .",
    "the effective parameters for @xmath4 and @xmath2 are obtained by extracting @xmath12 from the field distribution of a plane wave incidence inside the slab and then fitting with the hyperbolic dispersion given by eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "the details for obtaining the effective parameters @xmath4 and @xmath2 will be discussed below .",
    "one can see the pseudo focusing for the real metallic - air superlattice agrees very well with the homogeneous medium .",

    "we can obtain the @xmath5 inside the wire medium slab for an incident plane wave with an incident angle , @xmath14 . for @xmath6",
    ", we can easily get @xmath24 from the incident angle @xmath14 , since @xmath6 is conserved across the interfaces , where @xmath25 is the wavevector in the background .",
    "consequently , we can have the numerical dispersion relation of the wire medium by obtaining @xmath6 and @xmath5 for different incident angles .",
    "the minimum mean square fit does , in effect , average the field distribution on length scales small compared to the fitted effective wavelength .",
    "so the effective parameters are obtained for the averaged macroscopic field .",
    "the choice of the cross - section for the fit is arbitrary , but the results are practically independent on the location of the cross - section .",
    "the first structure for the 3d anisotropic wire medium in the optical region ( fig .  [ goldwire_negativerefraction ] ( a ) ) is a 3d gold - wire square lattice with the wire radius , @xmath26 , and the lattice constant , @xmath27 , in vacuum .",
    "figure  [ goldwire_negativerefraction ] ( b ) shows that the group negative refraction occurs when a plane wave with the wavelength , @xmath28 , and the transverse magnetic polarization , incidents on our simulated slab with an incident angle of @xmath29 , while the phase velocity still undergoes a positive refraction .",
    "pseudo focusing can also be seen from fig .  [ goldwire_focusing ] , where the transverse magnetic polarized wave with the wavelength , @xmath30 , coming out from a line source , is focused inside the simulated slab and then refocused on the other side of the slab .     away from the interface , which launches a cylindrical transverse magnetic polarized wave at the wavelength @xmath31 .",
