    "the existence of gravitational waves is an unambiguous prediction of the theory of general relativity @xcite . yet , despite efforts originating in the early nineteen sixties , gravitational waves have not been detected directly .",
    "nevertheless , observation of the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 convinces us that gravitational waves do exist , and that they are correctly described by einstein s theory @xcite .",
    "that gravitational waves have not yet been detected on earth is simply due to their incredible weakness : typical waves would produce in a bulk of matter a strain @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the extension of the matter , of order @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "needless to say , to measure this effect is a great challenge for experimentalists .",
    "there is reasonable hope that gravitational waves will be detected within the next ten years , thanks to a new generation of detectors which use interferometry to monitor the small displacements induced by the passage of a gravitational wave .",
    "two groups are currently involved in building large - scale interferometers : the american ligo team , and the french - italian virgo team .",
    "the ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ) project @xcite involves two detectors , to be built in hanford , washington , and in livingston , louisiana .",
    "construction has begun at both sites .",
    "each interferometer has an armlength of approximately 4 km .",
    "ligo should be completed by the turn of the century .",
    "the virgo ( so named after the galaxy cluster ) project @xcite involves a single interferometer , to be built near pisa , italy , with an armlength of approximately 3 km .",
    "virgo should also be completed by the turn of the century .",
    "the basic idea behind interferometric detectors is the following @xcite :    the interferometer is composed of two long ( 4 km for ligo ) vacuum pipes forming the letter * l*. a laser beam is split in two at the corner of the * l * , and is sent into each arm of the interferometer .",
    "each beam then bounces off a mass which is suspended at each end of the * l * ( a mirror has been coated onto each mass ) .",
    "the light is finally recombined at the beam splitter , and its intensity is measured by a photodiode .    when no gravitational wave is present at the interferometer , the length of each arm is so adjusted that when measured by the photodiode , the light s intensity is precisely zero ( the recombined beams are arranged to be precisely out of phase ) . however , when a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer , the armlengths are no longer constant , and the recombined beams no longer precisely out of phase .",
    "more precisely , during the first half of its cycle the gravitational wave increases the length of one arm , and decreases the length of the other . during the second half cycle ,",
    "the first arm is now shorter , and the second arm longer .",
    "the light s intensity therefore oscillates with the gravitational - wave frequency .",
    "the intensity is a measure of @xmath3 , where @xmath1 denotes the interferometer armlength , and @xmath4 the gravitational - wave field .",
    "interferometers are subject to various sources of noise which limit the detector s sensitivity to gravitational waves .",
    "the relative importance of each source depends on the frequency at which the interferometer oscillates @xcite .    at low frequencies ( @xmath5 )",
    "the detector s sensitivity is limited by seismic noise , which is due to the earth s seismic activity . at frequencies larger than 10",
    "hz the seismic noise can be eliminated with sophisticated isolation stacks ; these fail at low frequencies .    at high frequencies ( @xmath6 ) the detector s sensitivity is limited by photon shot noise , which is due to statistical errors in the counting of photons by the photodiode .",
    "this source of noise can be reduced by increasing the laser power , or making use of `` light recycling '' @xcite .    at intermediate frequencies ( @xmath7 between 10 hz and 100 hz )",
    "the noise is dominated by thermal noise , which is due to spurious motions of thermal origin .",
    "for example , the suspended masses are thermally excited and vibrate with their normal - mode frequencies ; this evidently affects the recombined laser beam .",
    "interferometers are therefore broad - band detectors , with good sensitivity in the range @xcite @xmath8 the required sensitivity for full - scale interferometers is approximately @xmath9 at peak sensitivity  a tall order .",
    "[ the subscript @xmath10 stands for `` noise level '' ; we will define @xmath11 precisely below . a plot of @xmath11 , appropriate for an interferometric detector with `` advanced '' sensitivity , is given in fig .  1 . ] for comparison , we may mention that the caltech 40 m prototype has already achieved @xmath12 at peak sensitivity @xmath13 .",
    "it is not implausible that improved technology and a factor of 100 in armlength will permit to reach the desired goal .",
    "the detector noise can be measured when no gravitational wave is present at the interferometer , the typical situation . then the detector output @xmath14 is given by noise alone : @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the noise .",
    "the noise is a random process @xcite : the function @xmath16 takes purely random values .",
    "consequently , the noise can only be studied using statistical methods . in the presence of a gravitational wave , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) must be replaced by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the gravitational - wave field .",
    "the statistical properties of the noise can be determined by careful measurement .",
    "for example , the time average @xmath19 can be constructed .",
    "this mean value can then be subtracted from @xmath16 and , without loss of generality , we can put @xmath20 . also from measurements , the noise s _ autocorrelation function _ @xmath21 can be constructed : @xmath22 @xmath23 gives the mean squared deviation of the noise with respect to the mean value .    in the following",
    "we will assume that the noise is _ stationary _ , in the sense that its statistical properties do not depend on time @xcite .",
    "this means , in particular , that the autocorrelation function does not depend explicitly on the origin of time @xmath24 , but only on the variable @xmath25 , as was expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we shall also assume that the noise satisfies the _ ergodic hypothesis _",
    ", so that time averages can be replaced with ensemble averages @xcite . here , the noise is imagined to be drawn from a representative ensemble , and the probability that it takes a particular realization @xmath16 is given by a specified probability distribution .",
    "the statistical properties of the noise then refer to this ( infinite dimensional ) distribution function .    in full generality , the statistical properties of the noise",
    "can only be summarized by constructing all the higher moments @xmath26 .",
    "if , however , the noise is assumed to be gaussian , in the sense that its probability distribution function is an infinite dimensional gaussian distribution @xcite , then the autocorrelation function contains all the information .",
    "real detector noise is neither strictly stationary nor strictly gaussian .",
    "however , on a timescale of hours , which is long compared with typical gravitational - wave bursts , the noise appears stationary to a good approximation @xcite . and non - gaussian components to the noise can be removed , to a large extent , by cross - correlating detector outputs from two widely separated interferometers @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a satisfactory approximation to take the noise to be stationary and gaussian .    under these assumptions the statistical properties of the detector noise",
    "are fully summarized by @xmath21 .",
    "it is convenient to work instead in the frequency domain , and to define @xcite the noise s _ spectral density _ @xmath27 as @xmath28 the spectral density is defined for @xmath29 only ; as @xmath21 is a real and even function , the negative frequencies only duplicate the information contained in the positive frequencies .    as @xmath16 is dimensionless , the spectral density has dimensions of time . by multiplying @xmath27 with the frequency and taking the square root ( since the spectral density represents the mean squared noise ) , one obtains the _ noise level _",
    "@xmath11 : @xmath30 this gives the equivalent gravitational - wave amplitude which would make the interferometer oscillate at just the noise level @xcite ; this quantity was introduced in the preceding section ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "coalescing compact binaries , composed of neutron stars and/or black holes , are the most promising source of gravitational waves for interferometric detectors @xcite .",
    "consider the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "this system consists of two neutron stars , each of @xmath31 , in orbital motion around each other .",
    "its present orbital period @xmath32 is approximately 8 hours , corresponding to orbital separations of about @xmath33 times the total mass .",
    "( here and throughout we use units such that @xmath34 . )",
    "its present eccentricity is approximately equal to 0.6 .",
    "the binary s orbital period is observed to decay at a rate @xmath35 corresponding precisely to a loss of energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves @xcite . in a timescale of approximately @xmath36 years the orbital period will have decreased to less than a tenth of a second , corresponding to orbital separations smaller than one hundred times the total mass . in this time",
    ", the eccentricity will have been reduced to extremely small values ( by the radiation reaction ) , so that the orbits are practically circular .",
    "the gravitational waves produced then have a frequency larger than 10 hz , and the frequency keeps increasing as the system evolves .",
    "_ during this late stage of orbital evolution , the gravitational waves sweep through the frequency bandwith of interferometric detectors , and thus become visible .",
    "_ by the time the orbital separation becomes as small as a few times the total mass , the neutron stars begin to merge .",
    "the gravitational waves produced during the final merger can not be detected by interferometric detectors , at least in the broad - band configuration described above @xcite : the gravitational - wave frequency is then larger than 1 000 hz , for which the detector noise is large .    of course",
    ", it would be foolish to wait @xmath36 years in order for psr 1913 + 16 to produce gravitational waves with appropriate frequency .",
    "fortunately , interferometric detectors will be sensitive enough to monitor binary coalescences occurring in quite a large volume of the universe , approximately @xmath37 ( corresponding to a radius of 200 mpc @xcite ) .",
    "it has been estimated @xcite that as many as 100 coalescences could occur every year in such a volume ( this includes coalescences of black - hole systems as well ) .",
    "this potentially large event rate is one of the factors that make gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries especially promising .",
    "the other factor comes from the fact that compact binaries are extremely clean astrophysical systems .",
    "it can be estimated @xcite that tidal interactions between the two stars are completely negligible , up to the point where the objects are about to merge .",
    "in particular , no mass transfer occurs .",
    "the system can therefore be modeled , to extremely good accuracy , as that of two point masses with a limited number of internal properties ( such as mass , spin , and quadrupole moment ) .",
    "the challenge in modeling coalescing compact binaries resides in formulating and solving the equations of motion and wave generation for a general relativistic two - body problem @xcite .",
    "at the crudest level , the gravitational - wave signal corresponding to an inspiraling binary system can be calculated by ( i ) assuming that the orbital motion is newtonian ( with the effects of radiation reaction incorporated ) and ( ii ) using the standard quadrupole formula for wave generation @xcite . as motivated above",
    ", we may also assume that the orbits are circular .",
    "we define @xmath18 to be the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "this is given by a linear combination , appropriate for interferometric detectors , of the two fundamental polarizations , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , of the gravitational - wave field .",
    "at this level of approximation , the signal is given by @xcite @xmath40 as expected , the signal decays as the inverse power of @xmath41 , the distance to the source .    in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath42 is a function of all the angles relevant to the problem : position of the source in the sky , orientation of the orbital plane , position and orientation of the detector on earth .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is called the _ chirp mass _ and represents a particular combination of the masses , given by @xmath44 the waveform depends on the chirp mass only , and not on any other combination of the masses .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 represents the gravitational - wave frequency , which is equal to _ twice _ the orbital frequency . because the system loses energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves , the frequency is not constant , but increases in time according to @xcite @xmath45 as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) shows that the amplitude of the signal , which is proportional to @xmath46 , also increases with time .",
    "a signal which increases both in frequency and in amplitude is known as a _ chirp _ , and this is the origin of the term `` chirp mass '' .",
    "finally , the phase function @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 because the frequency is not a constant , the phase accumulates nonlinearly with time .    for a system of two neutron stars ,",
    "the gravitational - wave signal undergoes approximately 16 000 oscillations as it sweeps through the frequency bandwith of an interferometric detector .",
    "the timescale for the frequency sweep is approximately 15 minutes .",
    "the orbital separation ranges from approximately 180 to 10 times the total mass @xmath49 , and the orbital velocity @xmath50 ranges from approximately 0.1 to 0.4 .",
    "this indicates that relativistic corrections must be inserted in eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) in order to obtain a satisfactory degree of accuracy .",
    "how does one go about finding a gravitational - wave signal in a noisy data stream , when typically the signal is not very strong ? and once the signal is found , how does one go about extracting the information it contains ? for signals of precisely known form ,",
    "one goes about this using the technique of _ matched filtering _",
    "signals from inspiraling compact binaries , since they can be calculated with high precision , belong to this class .",
    "the basic idea behind matched filtering is to use our knowledge about the signal in order to go find it in the data stream , after the noisy frequencies have been filtered out .",
    "suppose a signal of known form @xmath51 is present in the data stream . here",
    ", the vector @xmath52 collectively denotes all the parameters characterizing the signal . in the case of inspiraling binaries",
    ", these would be the time of arrival , the initial phase , the distance to the source , the position angles , the chirp mass , and other parameters to be introduced in sec .",
    "the detector output is given by @xmath53 where @xmath16 is the noise , whose statistical properties are fully summarized by the spectral density @xmath27 , as discussed in sec .",
    "the first step in matched filtering @xcite is to pass @xmath54 through a linear filter which removes the noisy frequencies .",
    "the idea here is to use our knowledge about the detector noise contained in @xmath27 in order to discard that part of the detector output for which the detector noise is large .",
    "the output is imagined to be decomposed into fourier modes according to @xmath55 ; the filter suppresses the modes @xmath56 for which @xmath27 is large .    in mathematical terminology ,",
    "a linear filter is a linear operation on a function @xmath54 .",
    "this operation can always be written as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the filter function .",
    "the filter which removes the noisy frequencies is the one such that @xmath59 the factor of 2 is conventional .    the next step in matched filtering consists of computing the overlap integral between the filtered output ( [ 13 ] ) and the known signal @xmath60 .",
    "the true value @xmath52 of the source parameters is not known prior to the measurement .",
    "this operation must therefore be repeated for a large number of trial values @xmath61 ; the corresponding signals @xmath60 are known as _",
    "templates_. the overlap integral defines the function @xmath62 given by @xmath63 to obtain the second line we have inserted the fourier decompositions of @xmath4 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , and carried out the integrations over time .",
    "the inner product @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are arbitrary functions of time , with fourier transforms @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a quantity analogous to @xmath62 can be defined for the noise alone , by replacing @xmath65 to the right of eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) by @xmath10 .",
    "operationally , this amounts to filtering the detector output when a gravitational - wave signal is known _ not _ to be present . because the noise is a random function , the integrals @xmath72 are random also . and because the noise is assumed to have zero mean , to take an average over all possible realizations of the noise ( by repeating the measurements many times ) would yield a zero value .",
    "none of these quantities would be especially useful .",
    "we are therefore led to consider the root - mean - square average of these integrals , @xmath73 to go from the first to the second line requires some machinery which will not be presented in this review .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for the missing steps .",
    "the _ signal - to - noise ratio _ is defined to be the ratio of @xmath74 over @xmath75 : @xmath76 it is clear that @xmath77 is a random function , since @xmath54 is itself a random function , being the superposition of signal plus noise .",
    "its expectation value , or average over all possible realizations of the noise , is zero in the absence of signal ( since @xmath20 ) , and @xmath78 in the presence of the signal @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to notice that in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) , the numerator is the overlap integral between the true signal @xmath51 and the templates @xmath60 . in the absence or presence of a signal ,",
    "the variance in the signal - to - noise ratio is precisely equal to unity @xcite , independently of the values of @xmath52 and @xmath61 .",
    "this fully summarizes the statistical properties of the signal - to - noise ratio , since @xmath77 is a gaussian random function .",
    "[ this can be seen from the fact that @xmath54 itself is gaussian , being the superposition of signal plus gaussian noise . ]",
    "it is intuitively clear that choosing a template with @xmath79 will produce the largest possible expectation value of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this statement , known as _",
    "wiener s theorem _",
    "@xcite , can easily be shown to be true by applying schwarz s inequality to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath80 the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio has a variance of unity indicates that a signal can be concluded to be present only if @xmath81 is significantly larger than 1 .",
    "we will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "the true value of the source parameters can therefore be determined by maximizing @xmath82 over all possible values of the trial parameters .",
    "the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio has a variance of unity implies that this determination can only have a limited degree of accuracy .",
    "the statistical errors decrease with increasing @xmath81 ; since this is proportional to the signal s amplitude , a stronger signal gives better accuracy .",
    "maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio is essentially equivalent to maximizing the overlap integral @xmath83 it is easy to see how the choice of the parameters @xmath61 can affect the overlap integral .",
    "consider a toy waveform with three parameters : arrival time , initial phase , and chirp mass .",
    "a mismatch in the arrival times clearly reduces the overlap integral : the signal and the template , taken to be functions of time , might have support in entirely different regions of the time axis , leading to a vanishing overlap . supposing that the arrival times are matched",
    ", a mismatch in the initial phases can also reduce the overlap integral : the signal and the template might be out of phase with each other , leading to an oscillating integrand and a vanishingly small overlap . finally , supposing that both the arrival times and initial phases are matched , a mismatch in the chirp masses would also reduce the overlap integral .",
    "this is because the chirp mass governs the rate at which the signal s frequency changes with time ; cf .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "signal and template , starting at the same time with the same phase , might thereafter go out of phase , thereby reducing the overlap .",
    "the first order of business when analysing the output of a gravitational - wave detector is to decide whether or not a signal is present . here we assume that the signal must be of a specific form , corresponding to a coalescing binary system . in this section",
    "we discuss signal detection  how the technique of matched filtering can be employed to find the signal in the noisy data stream . in the next section",
    "we will discuss signal measurement  how matched filtering is used to estimate the value of the source parameters once the signal has been found .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", a signal can be concluded to be present if the maximum value of the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath84 , is significantly larger than unity .",
    "in fact , there exists a threshold value @xmath85 such that a signal is concluded to present , with a certain confidence level , if @xmath86 . to figure out how large this threshold must be is a standard application of the statistical theory of signal detection @xcite , which was developed largely for the purpose of detecting radar signals .",
    "the theory can easily be taken over to the case gravitational - wave signals @xcite . to go into the detail of this theory",
    "would be outside the scope of this review .",
    "we shall simply state that @xmath85 is fixed by selecting a small , acceptable value for the probability that a signal would falsely be concluded to be present  the false alarm probability .",
    "( this is the neyman - pearson criterion @xcite , which is more precisely formulated in terms of the likelihood ratio , the ratio of the probability that a signal is present to the probability that it is absent . )",
    "once @xmath85 is fixed , the level of confidence that a signal is indeed present increases with @xmath86 .",
    "a typical ballpark value for the threshold is @xmath87 .    in the preceding paragraph",
    "it was assumed that the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath88 is computed using template waveforms which are functions of the parameters @xmath52 introduced in sec .",
    "these parameters have direct physical meaning ; they include the chirp mass and other meaningful parameters to be introduced in sec .  12 .",
    "however , since these parameters are _ not _ estimated during the detection stage of the data analysis ( they are estimated only _",
    "after _ a signal has been found ) , there is no particular need to parametrize the templates with @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , it may be desirable , in order to minimize the computational effort , to parametrize the signal in a completely different way .",
    "the new parameters , @xmath89 , would then have no particular physical significance .",
    "what is required is that the new templates , @xmath90 , reproduce the behaviour of the expected gravitational - wave signal . in other words , the templates @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath90 should span the same `` signal space '' , but @xmath90 should do so most efficiently . unlike @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath90 need not be derived from the field equations of general relativity . with these new _ detection templates _ , the signal - to - noise ratio is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) . as before",
    ", a signal is concluded to be present if @xmath93 .",
    "once the detection templates @xmath90 have been used to conclude that a signal is present in the data stream , they are replaced with the _ measurement templates _ @xmath60 in order to estimate the value of the physical parameters @xmath52 .",
    "the procedure to estimate the source parameters was explained in sec .",
    "as was mentioned , the idea is to maximize over all possible values of the trial parameters the overlap integral @xmath94 we already have discussed the effect of a mismatch in the value of the parameters .",
    "what remains to be discussed is the effect of a mismatch in the functional form of the template with respect to that of the true waveform .",
    "the true waveform is governed by the exact laws of general relativity .",
    "the template , on the other hand , is necessarily constructed using an approximation to the exact laws .",
    "( that approximations must be made in analytic calculations is obvious ; in a numerical treatment the approximation resides in the finite differencing of the field equations . )",
    "this , clearly , must have an effect on our strategy for extracting the information contained in the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "this can be seen simply from the fact that wiener s theorem , as stated in sec .",
    "8 , strictly requires signal and template to have the same functional form ; they are allowed to differ only in the value of their parameters .",
    "suppose that gravitational waves coming from a given source are received without noise , so that the true signal @xmath51 is measured accurately .",
    "suppose also that the true value @xmath52 of the source parameters is known ( god has spoken ) .",
    "then a computation of the overlap integral with @xmath79 but with an approximate template @xmath60 will not yield the maximum possible value for @xmath77 .",
    "this is because the approximation differs from the true signal , both in amplitude and in phase .",
    "since both signal and template undergo a large number of oscillations ( recall that for a system of two neutron stars , this number is approximately 16 000 ) , the overlap integral is most sensitive to phase differences : a slight phase lag causes the integrand to oscillate , thereby severely reducing the signal - to - noise ratio with respect to its maximum possible value .",
    "a gravitational - wave astronomer does nt know before the measurement the true value of the source parameters , and must work with an approximation to the true general - relativistic waveform .",
    "we have seen that the phase lag occurring between the true signal and the approximate template when the parameters are matched reduces the signal - to - noise ratio from its maximum possible value .",
    "it follows that maximizing @xmath77 with approximate templates introduce _ systematic errors _ into the estimation of the source parameters : evaluating the signal - to - noise ratio with @xmath95 will return , for some @xmath96 , a number larger than @xmath97 .",
    "the systematic errors are precisely the value of @xmath96 for which the signal - to - noise ratio is largest",
    ". if the templates are a poor approximation to the true signal , then the systematic errors will be larger than the statistical errors arising because @xmath77 is a random function ( see sec .",
    "we therefore appreciate the need for constructing measurement templates which are as accurate as possible , especially in phase @xcite .",
    "the requirement is that the systematic errors in the estimated parameters must be smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "an estimate for the required degree of accuracy comes from the observation that the overlap integral will be significantly reduced if the template loses phase by as much as one wave cycle with respect to the true signal .",
    "since the total number of wave cycles is approximately 16 000 , we have @xmath98 since the orbital velocity @xmath99 is of order @xmath100 when the gravitational - wave frequency is in the relevant bandwidth , relativistic corrections _ at least _ of order @xmath101 are required to improve the quadrupole - formula expression given in sec .",
    "as we shall see , this is an underestimate .",
    "we have seen that accurate measurement templates are required to make the most of the gravitational - wave signals originating from coalescing compact binaries .",
    "we also have seen that the quadrupole - formula waveform , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , is not sufficiently accurate ; relativistic corrections at least of order @xmath101 are required .",
    "how does one go about calculating these ?",
    "a possible line of approach is to use a slow - motion approximation to the equations of general relativity .",
    "this is based on the requirement that if @xmath99 is a typical velocity inside the matter source , then @xmath102 we shall call this approximation `` post - newtonian theory '' @xcite .",
    "we point out that for binary systems , post - newtonian theory makes no assumption regarding the relative size of the two masses .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the perturbation approach , discussed in sec .  13 , in which the mass ratio is assumed to be small , but no restriction is put on @xmath99 .    in post - newtonian theory @xcite , one starts by defining fields @xmath103 as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the inverse of the true metric @xmath106 with determinant @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the metric of minkowski spacetime .",
    "when the harmonic gauge conditions @xmath109 are imposed , the _ exact _ einstein field equations reduce to @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the flat - spacetime wave operator , @xmath112 is the stress - energy tensor of the source , and @xmath113 is nonlinear in @xmath103 and represents an effective stress - energy tensor for the gravitational field .    the detailed way in which one solves these equations is quite complicated , and will not be described here .",
    "the essential ideas are these @xcite :    one first integrates the equations in the near zone ( @xmath114 , where @xmath41 is the flat - space radius and @xmath115 the gravitational wavelength ) assuming slow motion , or @xmath116 .",
    "one does this by iterations : the nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) are first neglected , and the resulting linear equations integrated .",
    "these solutions are then used as input for the next iteration .",
    "this process is continued until the desired degree of accuracy is obtained .",
    "this is the standard post - newtonian approach @xcite .",
    "one next integrates the equations everywhere in the vacuum region outside the source .",
    "this is done once again by iterations , assuming @xmath117 , but assuming nothing about the relative size of @xmath118 with respect to the spatial derivatives .",
    "this is because the vacuum region contains the wave zone , in which the field propagates with the speed of light ; a slow - motion assumption would therefore not do for the field itself .",

    "since there is no reason to believe that the convergence of the post - newtonian expansion would be much improved for systems of comparable masses , our results should also apply , at least qualitatively , for such systems .    one way to address",

    "this is done without justification , but reflects the adopted point of view that the quality of the post - newtonian approximation should not be appreciably affected by the finite - mass corrections .    in doing this extrapolation ,",
    "some thought must be given as to the interpretation of the ratio @xmath194 .",

    "this shows that the apparently small discrepancies between the exact and post - newtonian results for @xmath124 and @xmath128 provide a serious obstacle to the construction of accurate measurement templates .",

    "the third column of the table displays the values of @xmath217 calculated in this way .",
    "we see that most of the signal - to - noise is recovered : @xmath217 can now be as large as 0.9864 instead of 0.7651 .",
    "why does the exact expression for @xmath128 give such better results ?",
    "it can be established @xcite that this has to do with the following fact : while the exact expression for @xmath128 correctly goes to zero at @xmath221 ( at the innermost circular orbit ) , its post - newtonian analogue fails to do so .",
    "[ for example , the right - hand side of eq .",

    "when corrected for this , the post - newtonian template gives much better results .",
    "we therefore see that the poor convergence of the post - newtonian expansion is a serious obstacle to the construction of accurate measurement templates .",
    "devising ways to extract the information contained in gravitational waves produced during the late inspiral of a compact binary system poses a great challenge to theoretical physicists .",
    "it is not clear that `` simply '' pushing to higher order in post - newtonian theory will be enough to produce sufficiently accurate measurement templates ( such that the systematic errors will be smaller than the statistical errors ) .",
    "there may be a need for theorists to develop alternative ways of dealing with this problem .",
    "it should be stressed that the convergence problem does not arise when constructing _",
    "detection templates_. indeed , as was discussed in sec .",
    "9 , there is no particular need for these templates to be derived from the equations of general relativity . and since the detection templates need not involve any parameters of direct physical significance , the notion of systematic errors does not apply to them .",
    "the only requirement for constructing detection templates is that they should span the appropriate `` signal space '' , and that they should do so the most efficiently .",
    "the poor convergence of the post - newtonian expansion is therefore not an obstacle for _ detecting _ gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries .",
    "it is only an obstacle for extracting the information that the waves contain . to overcome this obstacle",
