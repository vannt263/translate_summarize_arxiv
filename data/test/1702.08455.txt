    "the perturbative nonrenormalizability of the theory of general relativity ( gr ) is one of the greatest obstacles against proposing quantum gravity theory that should be correct at all scales .",

    "the recent detection of the gravitational waves is strictly limited to pulsars in binary star systems @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the resulting gravitational waves become very great .    at a gaussian fixed point , gr does not satisfy the perturbative renormalizability because the gravitational coupling ( @xmath0 ) is a dimensioned quantity ( @xmath1 ) and accordingly the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences are uncontrollable . by introducing higher terms of the scalar curvature ,",

    ", this introduces an additional problem , for instance , to the uniqueness @xcite . from a minimal approach that will be elaborated below , which assures perturbatively renormalizable uv completion of gr as quantum field theory ( qft ) for @xmath2-dimensional metric field , one looses some properties of gr and creates additional degrees - of - freedom .",
    "such an approach benefits from the success of qft in describing all forces ( except gravity so - far ) and the standard model of the elementary particles .",
    "the scalar field theory , that was proposed by lifshitz in order to explain the quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter @xcite , inspired horava to propose a theory for the quantum gravity with an anisotropic scaling in uv .",
    "this new approach is thus known as horava - lifshitz gravity ( hlg ) @xcite , where the dynamical critical exponent ( @xmath3 ) makes the theory non - relativistic .    in analogy to critical systems , the uv fixed point has been treated @xcite .",
    "the hlg approach assures causal dynamical triangulations @xcite , renormalization group approaches based on asymptotic safety @xcite and symmetries of gr .",
    "this approach was discussed in an extensive amount of literature @xcite , where problems such as , internal consistency and compatibility with observations are treated , as well .",
    "the new dimensionless coupling @xmath4 is assumed to approach unity in the infrared ( ir ) limit with the argumentation that at the hlg - charactering parameter @xmath5 , hlg theory ca nt be reduced to gr .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we mention that this is not always the case for all hlg models @xcite .",
    "recent astrophysical observations obviously indicate that the universe expands with an accelerating rate , probably due to dark energy @xcite . besides inflation , a series of symmetry - breaking phase transitions , where topological defects may have been formed @xcite , were conjecture to take place . on the other hand",

    "we notice that the expansion depicted in the right - hand panel is faster than the one illustrated in the left - hand panel .",
    "again , the universe seems to start up its evolution from a very large scale factor .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] presents the results from chaplygin ( a ) and qcd ( b ) equations of states .",
    "the results of the chaplygin gas strongly depends on the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the hlg with detailed balance conditions results in an almost linear dependence of @xmath151 and @xmath150 .",
    "the non - singular solutions appear in both hlg approaches and equations of state .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the chaplygin and qcd results is due to non - baryonic and baryonic equations - of - state , respectively .",
    "while the present article was under review , we have completely conducted and published a research paper in which the proposed solutions are confronted to recent planck and bicepii observations @xcite . with single scalar field potentials describing power - law and minimal - supersymmetrically extended inflation , we have derived possible modifications in the friedmann equations . for various eos",
    ", the dependences of the tensorial and spectral density fluctuations ( and their ratio ) on the inflation field are characterized .",
    "the tensorial - to - spectral density fluctuations are calculated with varying spectral index .",
    "it was found that , they decrease when moving from hlg with non - detailed balance conditions , to friedmann gravity , to hlg without the projectibility conditions , and to hlg with detailed balance conditions .",
    "such a pattern remains valid for various eos and different inflation potential models .",
    "the calculations fit well with the recent planck observations @xcite .",
    "even , when studying the consequences of the quantum fluctuations on our understanding of landau - raychaudhuri equations , we found that cosmic eos play an essential role @xcite .",
    "a theory for quantum gravity with an anisotropic scaling in uv based on a scalar field theory was proposed by horava , who was inspired by lifshitz theory for the quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter physics .",
    "horava benefited from the success of qft in describing all forces ( except gravity ) and the standard model for the particle physics .",
    "we study the impacts of various equations - of - state on flrw cosmology based on horava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "we also implement the so - called hlg with detailed balance conditions , which was thought as a technical trick to reduce couplings in the theory . from the possible connection between detailed balance conditions and the entropic origin of the gravity",
    ", the constructed potential can be used instead of adopting an effective field theory . both are compared with the gr gravity .    in this work ,",
    "we have studied the dependence of scale factor ( @xmath151 ) and cosmic time ( @xmath150 ) in the context of horava - lifshitz gravity in early universe by using different equations - of - state .",
    "we have compared the results with the gr gravity .",
    "remarkable differences from what is predicted by gr are found .",
    "also , a noticeable dependence on the equations of state is observed in singular and non - singular big bang .",
    "these observations are precautionarily corresponding to the fixed parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the results presented in present paper are strongly depending on these parameters , for instance , the non - singular solutions can be to a large extend understood due to finite cosmological constant , @xmath30 .",
    "the present work presents a systematic analysis for the equations of state characterizing the cosmic geometry and proposes a link between the conventional gravity by gr and its horava - lifshitz counterparts .",
    "the latter are power - counting renormalizable quantum theories which assure causal dynamical triangulations , renormalization group approaches based on asymptotic safety and symmetries of gr .",
    "the horava - lifshitz gravity introduces a new set of symmetries imposing invariance under foliation - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "various types of equations of state are implemented .    in future works , we intend to extend this study to cover various topics , such as comparison with other theories such as the gravity s rainbow @xcite , and determining the possible impacts of the generalized uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "also , we plan to study third quantization of this theory @xcite , such as in a simple cosmological model @xcite .",
    "we conclude that hlg can explain various epochs in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , hlg might be able to reproduce the entire cosmic history with and without singular big bang .",
    "it intends to study the stability of the given flrw solutions and then analyse the universe evolution scenarios , especially that hlg is conjectured to be a candidate for a quantum field theory of gravity , despite its yet - unresolved problems .",

    "which are well - known tools to describe nature , degrees of freedom , decomposition , size and even the overall dynamics controlling evolution of the medium from which they are originating , is therefore very essential . for the thermodynamical pressure , an approximate attempt utilizing the higher - order moments of the particle multiplicity seems to be promising @xcite . on the other hand , determining the thermodynamical energy density and even relating the bjorken energy density to the lattice energy density depends on lattice qcd at finite baryon chemical potential and first - principle estimation of the formation time of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the energy density can be deduced from the derivative of the free energy with respect to inverse temperature .",
