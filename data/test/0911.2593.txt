    "infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic studies of the dynamics of hydrogen bonds ( hbs ) continue to trigger considerable theoretical and experimental efforts not at least due to the outstanding importance of this type of bonding for a variety of phenomena in chemical and biological physics @xcite . in recent years ultrafast",
    "ir spectroscopy has demonstrated its capability to unravel the details of the dynamics hidden in linear absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "phthalic acid monomethylester ( pmme ) has served as model system for studying the ultrafast vibrational dynamics of medium strong hbs @xcite .",
    "experimental results include the observation of wave packet dynamics due to excitation of a low - frequency mode which modulates the hb length and which is coupled to the oh - stretching fundamental transition @xcite , and the unraveling of the path for the ultrafast vibrational energy relaxation using two - color pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the observed subpicosecond relaxation of the oh - stretching mode has been explained by an energy cascading mechanism involving different oh - bending modes of the hb . concerning the linear ir spectrum ,",
    "however , there is only a study for the deuterated case which combined a three - dimensional model hamiltonian with rates for phase and energy relaxation according to dissipation theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was found that the ir lineshape in the od - stretching region is dominated by a fermi - resonance between the od - stretching fundamental and the od - bending overtone .",
    "the resulting double peak shape of the absorption is typical for hydrogen - bonded systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present study sets the focus on the ir spectrum of the normal species of pmme in the range of the oh - stretching fundamental transition around 3000 .",
    "two complementary models will be considered .",
    "first , a five - dimensional gas phase hamiltonian is determined and diagonalized to obtain detailed insight into the composition of vibrational eigenstates in the considered spectral range .",
    "degrees of freedom are selected starting from the oh - stretching and bending modes which are supplemented by additional modes according to calculated force constants up to fourth order .",
    "second , hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics ( qm / mm ) simulations of classical trajectories of pmme in ccl@xmath0 solution are performed .",
    "besides an analysis of the hb geometry in solution , the dipole - dipole autocorrelation function is calculated from which the ir absorption spectrum is obtained ( for related applications to hydrogen - bonded systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : methods ] starts with an account on the determination of the hamiltonian for pmme in gas phase .",
    "this is followed by a summary of the qm / mm protocol .",
    "results for the gas phase ir spectrum are given in section [ sec : res : gas ] and the analysis of the condensed phase simulations is presented in section [ sec : res : cond ] .",
    "the paper is summarized in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the electronic ground state geometry of pmme in the gas phase has been optimized using the dft / b3lyp level of theory with a gaussian 6 - 31+g(d , p ) basis set @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] . a detailed account on the gas phase geometry as well as on its dependence on the quantum chemical method can be found in ref .",
    "focussing on the vicinity of the most stable configuration we have chosen to express the gas phase hamiltonian in terms of normal mode coordinates @xmath1 . in general",
    "one can write the pes in terms of a correlation expansion @xcite v(\\{q_i } ) & = & _ i v_i^(1)(q_i ) + _ i < j v^(2)_ij(q_i , q_j ) + _ i < j < k v^(3)_ijk(q_i , q_j , q_k ) + & + & _ i < j < k < l v^(4)_ijkl(q_i , q_j , q_k , q_l ) +  restricting to four - mode correlations this type of pes is readily obtained by the anharmonic expansion v(\\{q_i } ) = _ i _ i^2 q_i^2 + _ ijk k_ijk q_iq_jq_k + _ ijkl k_ijkl q_iq_jq_kq_l . [ taylor ] here , the @xmath2 are the harmonic frequencies and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the third- and fourth - order anharmonic couplings . for the present case of pmme",
    "they have been calculated by combining finite differencing with analytical second derivatives as described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "being interested in the pmme hb dynamics we have selected a set of relevant modes comprising a reduced five - dimensional ( 5d ) quantum mechanical model as follows : starting point are the coupled oh - stretching ( @xmath5 ) and oh - bending ( @xmath6 ) modes with harmonic frequencies of 3279 and 1446 , respectively , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] .",
    "further we included the strongest coupled low - frequency mode @xmath7 with harmonic frequency of 39 .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] excitation of this mode leads to a periodic modulation of the o - o distance in the hb .",
    "hence the choice of such a mode is motivated by the experimental observation of damped low - frequency wave packet motion in ref .",
    "note , however , that from the oscillatory component of the pump - probe signal a frequency of @xmath8100 had been extracted .",
    "looking for higher frequency modes of similar character one finds a vibration with a harmonic frequency of 72 @xcite . however , its anharmonic coupling to the stretching vibration is considerably smaller than for the selected @xmath7 .",
    "further , for such low - frequency modes the harmonic approximation performs usually rather poor .",
    "indeed the anharmonic frequency of @xmath7 within the present model is 60 .",
    "the selection of further modes is guided by the available anharmonic coupling constants as well as the possible resonances . here , we find two modes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which have out - of - plane oh - bending character ( see , fig . [",
    "fig : modes ] ) that could have significant influence on the oh - stretching and in particular oh - bending vibration .",
    "their harmonic frequencies are 682 and 785 , respectively , and their combination as well as the overtone transitions are close in resonance to the fundamental transition of mode @xmath6 . moreover , the combination of @xmath6 and the overtones of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is close in energy to the oh - stretching fundamental transition .",
    "the most important anharmonic coupling constants for these five modes are summarized in tab . [",
    "tab : afc ] .",
    "the 5d model coordinates will be labeled as @xmath11 .",
    "the question arises whether the fourth - order approximation , eq . , is justified for describing the selected modes . in order to scrutinize this point",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : afc ] exemplarily the potentials along @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 as obtained from the fourth - order expansion ( dashed line ) and from a numerical evaluation on a grid ( solid line ) .",
    "according to panel ( a ) , the anharmonic force field description of @xmath5 reproduces the exact potential for small displacements , but the two curves start to deviate above @xmath84000 .",
    "the anharmonicity of the bending mode , @xmath6 , is not very pronounced what is reflected in a good agreement between the two curves up to 12000 in panel ( b ) .",
    "the fourth order description breaks down completely for the low - frequency mode , @xmath7 , as seen in panel ( c ) .",
    "the anharmonicity of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is only modest and fourth - order expansions and grid based potentials essentially agree over the considered range .",
    "nevertheless , we have chosen to use the obtained grid - based data for representing all one mode potentials @xmath15 .",
    "further , the following two - mode potentials have been generated on a numerical grid : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "this selection is motivated by the focus which is on the oh - stretching region of the spectrum where ( i ) the fermi - resonance type coupling between the stretching fundamental and the bending overtone is of particular importance ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : afc ] ) and ( ii ) low - frequency wave packet motion can be triggered by oh stretching excitation .",
    "all other correlations up to the four - mode term have been included in terms of the calculated force constants .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has been diagonalized assuming a diagonal kinetic energy operator in a step - wise procedure as follows : first , the uncoupled one - dimensional hamiltonians have been diagonalized ( note that the coordinates are mass - weighted ) = e_n^i by using the fourier - grid - hamiltonian ( fgh ) method @xcite ( grid parameters : @xmath12 - 128 points in [ -0.9:1.7 ] , @xmath13 - 64 points in [ -2.0:2.0 ] , @xmath19 and @xmath20 - 64 points in [ -2.1 2.1 ] , @xmath14 - 128 points in [ -8.0:8.0 ] ( intervals in @xmath21 ) ) .",
    "second , from these zero - order functions @xmath22 , two product bases are formed for the modes ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) including 5@xmath25 7 and 7@xmath25 7 functions , respectively .",
    "the respective 2-mode hamiltonians are diagonalized and the lowest 5 and 20 eigenfunctions are used to span a product basis for the diagonalization of the 4-mode hamiltonian at the equilibrium geometry of the low - frequency mode @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the parameters for the successive diagonalization have been chosen such as to obtain converged eigenstates for transitions up to about 3600 .    due to the time scale separation between the four fast modes",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and the mode @xmath7 , the resulting eigenvalues , which span a diabatic basis , can be used for the characterization of the nature of the fast modes states . denoting the diabatic basis as @xmath26 , these states obey the following schrdinger equation : = e^diab _ . here",

    "since there are no symmetry restrictions , the low - frequency mode in principle will couple all states in this region of the present model .",

    "it is dominated by the above mentioned fermi - resonance , but also contains the signature of the progression with respect to the low - frequency mode on the blue side of the @xmath5 dominated peak .",
    "judging the intensities of te various peaks , it should be kept in mind that the dipole surface is described by selected one mode terms only .",
    "note that this progression is the origin of the wave packet motion of the low - frequency hb mode which has been observed in ref .",
    "needless to point to the pronounced anharmonicity of @xmath7 which together with the many diabatic levels coupled in this spectral range makes the dynamical problem considerably more complicated than that of shifted harmonic oscillators .",
    "the geometry of the hb along the trajectory will be characterized by the hb length , @xmath47 , the angle , @xmath48 , the bending angle of the oh vibration , @xmath49 , and the dihedral angle @xmath50 ; for labeling see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] .",
    "the change of these parameters along part of the production trajectory is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "note that the oh bond length itself does not change appreciably , its average value is 1.02   and the variation is 0.04   .",
    "in other words , this system does not support any hydrogen transfer similar to the prediction of the gas phase calculations @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : geo]a we obtain the average hb length of @xmath51 and a rms variation of 0.11  . as compared with the gas phase dft / b3lyp 6 - 31+g(d , p ) geometry",
    "the hb is on average elongated by 0.07 @xcite .",
    "large elongations correlate with strong deviations of the hb from linearity as seen in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] , e.g. for @xmath81.5 ps and @xmath83.2 ps . the average deviation from linearity is 24@xmath41 . the time evolution of the oh bending angle @xmath52 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo]b , its average and rms variation are 111@xmath41 and 6@xmath41 , respectively . finally , we focus on the planarity of the hb with respect to the dihedral angle @xmath53 .",
    "note that the gas phase structure of pmme has been calculated to be overall nonplanar @xcite .",
    "the gas phase dft value is obtained as @xmath54 . in condensed phase",
    "the average and rms variation are 15@xmath41 and 65@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of @xmath53 values is , however , bimodal with the main peak at 57@xmath41 and a 40% smaller peak at -53@xmath41 .",
    "thus , in comparison with the gas phase pmme assumes more often a structure where carboxyl and ester groups are twisted with respect to each other .",
    "this fact also indicates the limitations of the gas phase model presented above .",
    "finally , we point out that the frequently observed changes from 180 to -180@xmath41 and vice versa are indicative of linear hb geometries .      the total ir spectrum according to eq .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir ] .",
    "our focus will be on the oh - stretch region around 3000 which is shown enlarged in fig .",
    "[ fig : specana ] .",
    "panel ( a ) compares the calculated ir spectrum with the experimental result of ref .",
    "the experimental spectrum exhibits a broad band covering the range from @xmath82750 to @xmath83250 .",
    "comparison with the spectrum of the deuterated species @xcite shows that the sharp feature around 2950 must be due to some ch stretching vibration which is not coupled to the hb motion .",
    "the two features to the left and right of this peak survive deuteration as well .",
    "the two peaks around @xmath82600 , on the other hand , disappear upon deuteration and should be related to the hb .    the calculated ir spectrum ,",
    "although not reproducing the full width of the measured band , compares rather well with experiment .",
    "this concerns the position of the main band , but also the appearance of some intensity around 2600 .",
    "the assignment of the spectrum can be guided by comparison with the stick spectrum of the gas phase model which is also shown in fig . [ fig : specana]a . essentially , the two fermi - resonance lines are in the relevant spectral region of the main experimental band , giving evidence that the latter is indeed containing these transitions .",
    "its width is likely to originate from the fluctuations of the hb parameters as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . in addition",
    "the position of the stick spectrum agrees nicely with that coming from the condensed phase simulation .",
    "as far as the features around 2600 are concerned we can only conclude that the respective transitions are not due to excitations of those modes which are part of the 5d model , see fig . [",
    "fig : modes ] .",
    "another means for gaining insight into the nature of the motions contributing to the ir spectrum is an analysis in terms of the density of states due to certain groups of atoms .",
    "respective results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : specana]b .",
    "overall the width of ir spectrum in the considered range is comparable to the density of states .",
    "the latter is , however , dominated by contributions of non - h - bonded hydrogen motions .",
    "contributions from the hydrogen of the hb are in the range between @xmath8 2850 and 3000 which is in accord with the discussion of panel ( a ) .",
    "interestingly there is some intensity of @xmath55 around 2600 , i.e. the mentioned features in the ir spectrum are indeed likely to be due to the dynamics of the hb as suggested by deuteration studies .",
    "the quantum mechanical calculation of the linewidth in condensed phase requires to have at hand the fluctuations of the transition frequencies of the high frequency modes due to their interaction with the surrounding modes @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have used an empirical mapping between hb distances and transition frequencies to predict the linewidth of the nh - stretching transition in a solvated adenine - uracil base pair .",
    "this mapping was based on available crystal structure data @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . however , no such empirical correlation is available for pmme type of molecules",
    ". an alternative could be the explicit calculation of potential energy curves for selected coordinates on - the - fly along the trajectory @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : corr ] shows results of respective calculations for the fermi - resonance states , i.e. the dependence on the bending overtone and the stretching fundamental transition on the hb length , @xmath47 . for the @xmath5 mode one can recognize the expected correlation , i.e. the increase of the transition frequency with @xmath47 .",
    "note that this holds irrespective of the nonlinearity and wide variability of the hb parameters seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . for the bending overtone ,",
    "on the other hand , no such correlation is discernible .",
    "the reason can be found in the difficulty to define the coordinate for this bending motion due to the large flexibility of the structure which mixes different types of bending motions , a fact that can not be captured by the present definition of coordinates within the two - dimensional model .",
    "the ir absorption spectrum of pmme in the spectral range of the hydrogen - bonded oh - stretching vibration has been investigated using a five - dimensional gas phase quantum mechanical model as well as condensed phase classical molecular dynamics simulations on the basis of the qm / mm approach .",
    "the gas phase model predicts specific anharmonic coupling patterns between the high - frequency oh stretching vibration and lower - frequency bending modes .",
    "in particular it was found that the region around 3000 contains a fermi resonance between the @xmath5-stretching fundamental and the first @xmath6-bending overtone vibration with considerable oscillator strength redistribution .",
    "the effect of low - frequency hb motion has been studied within the picture of potential energy curves defined for the diabatic states of the higher - frequency modes .",
    "these curves are markedly anharmonic and form a dense manifold of coupled states in the 3000 range . in the ir spectrum",
    "the low - frequency mode gives rise to a vibrational progression along with the @xmath5 fundamental transition .",
    "these finding are similar to the case of deuterated pmme @xcite .    the condensed phase simulations of the ir spectrum gave a broad band in the 3000 region whose position is not only in agreement with the main experimental band .",
    "in addition there is a weak band around 2600 coinciding with an experimental feature .",
    "analysis in terms of the density of states led to the conclusion that this band has contributions from hb motions . comparing gas and condensed phase ir spectra we found an overall good agreement as far as the spectral range is concerned .",
    "however , the trajectory simulations also indicate that in solution a different configuration may also be present and contribute to the spectrum .",
    "finally , we have explored the possibility to correlate @xmath5 fundamental and @xmath6 overtone excitation to the length of the hb . while there appears to be a reasonable correlation with respect to @xmath5 ,",
    "the scatter in the @xmath6 points is considerable , thus pointing to the difficulty of defining the bending motion in terms of a single coordinate .",
