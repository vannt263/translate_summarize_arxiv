    "given a heegaard surface @xmath4 in a 3-manifold , @xmath5 , one can _ stabilize _ to obtain a splitting of higher genus by taking the connected sum of @xmath4 with the genus one splitting of @xmath6 .",
    "suppose @xmath7 and @xmath8 are heegaard splittings of @xmath5 , where @xmath9 .",
    "it is a classical result of reidemeister @xcite and singer @xcite from 1933 that as long as @xmath7 and @xmath8 induce the same partition of the components of @xmath10 , stabilizing @xmath7 some number of times produces a stabilization of @xmath8 .",
    "just one stabilization was proved to always be sufficient in large classes of 3-manifolds , including seifert fibered spaces @xcite , genus two 3-manifolds @xcite , and most graph manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of examples to the contrary led to  the stabilization conjecture \" : any pair of heegaard splittings requires at most one stabilization to become equivalent .",
    "( see conjecture 7.4 in @xcite . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to produce several families of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture .",
    "this work was announced in december of 2007 at a workshop on _ triangulations , heegaard splittings , and hyperbolic geometry _ , at the american institute of mathematics . at the same conference another family of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture was announced by hass , thompson , and thurston , and their preprint has since appeared on the arxiv @xcite .",
    "their proof uses mainly geometric techniques .",
    "several months later johnson posted a preprint on the arxiv @xcite containing similar results that was motivated by this work , but is completely combinatorial .",
    "the proofs presented here are quite different than either of these .    here",
    "we construct three families of counter - examples .",
    "these are described by the following theorems :    * theorem [ t : flipcounterexample ] . * _ for each @xmath11 there is a closed , orientable 3-manifold that has a genus @xmath0 heegaard splitting which must be stabilized at least @xmath1 times to become equivalent to the splitting obtained from it by reversing its orientation . _",
    "* theorem [ t : torusboundarycounterexamples ] . *",
    "_ for each @xmath12 there is an orientable 3-manifold whose boundary is a torus , that has two genus @xmath0 heegaard splittings which must be stabilized at least @xmath2 times to become equivalent . _    * theorem [ t : closedcounterexamples ] . * _ for each @xmath13 there is a closed , orientable 3-manifold that has a pair of genus @xmath0 heegaard splittings which must be stabilized at least @xmath3 times to become equivalent ( regardless of their orientations ) . _    the key to the constructions of the counter - examples given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is to use heegaard splittings formed by gluing together two handlebodies by a very complicated homeomorphism .",
    "such splittings have very high hempel distance @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the examples constructed here are splittings of manifolds that are constructed from two or more component manifolds by gluing along incompressible surfaces via a very complicated map .",
    "the splittings themselves come from amalgamations of splittings of the component manifolds , and so have hempel distance at most one .",

    "[ s : firstdefsection ] through [ s : lastdefsection ] we mostly review the definitions and results given in @xcite .",

    "s : barriersurfaces ] we review the main result from @xcite , which says that complicated amalgamations act as barriers to low genus incompressible , strongly irreducible , and critical surfaces . in section [ s : counterexamples ] we use all of this machinery to construct our counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture . in the sequel",
    "@xcite we use the machinery presented in sections [ s : firstdefsection ] through [ s : barriersurfaces ] to show that  sufficiently complicated \" amalgamations of unstabilized , boundary - unstabilized heegaard splittings are also unstabilized .",
    "in this section we recall the definitions of various classes of topologically interesting surfaces .",
    "the first are the _",
    "incompressible _ surfaces of haken @xcite , which have played a central role in 3-manifold topology .",
