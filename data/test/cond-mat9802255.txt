    "collective phenomena in systems far from thermal equilibrium have been of considerable interest in recent years @xcite . unlike systems in thermal equilibrium where the gibbs picture provides a theoretical framework within which such phenomena can be studied , here no such framework exists and one has to resort to studies of specific models in order to gain some understanding of the phenomena involved .    one class of such models is driven diffusive systems ( dds ) @xcite . driven by an external field these systems do not generically obey detailed balance so that the steady state has non - vanishing currents . theoretical studies of dds have revealed basic differences between systems in thermal equilibrium and systems far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with short - range interactions do not exhibit phenomena such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and phase separation ( except in the limit of zero temperature or in the context of long - range interactions ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , some examples of noisy @xmath0 dds with local dynamics have been found to exhibit such phenomena .",
    "one example of a noisy system which exhibits ssb in @xmath0 is the asymmetric exclusion model of two types of charge studied in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "two types of charge are biased to move in opposite directions on a @xmath0 lattice with open ends .",
    "the charges interact via a hard - core interaction , and are injected at one end of the lattice and ejected at the other end .",
    "this model is symmetric under the combined operations of charge conjugation and parity ( pc symmetry ) .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken in the steady state , where the currents of the two charges are not equal .",
    "the reason for symmetry breaking in this model lies to some extent in the open boundaries .",
    "other examples of models in which there is ssb in @xmath0 have also been found in the context of cellular automata @xcite and surface growth @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "ssb was due to the fact that one of the rates for a local dynamical move in the models is zero .",
    "once this zero rate changes to a non - zero rate ssb disappears .",
    "a closely related problem to spontaneous symmetry breaking , is that of _ phase separation _ in @xmath0 noisy systems . this has been observed in driven diffusive models with inhomogeneities , such as defect sites @xcite or particles @xcite . in these models",
    "it has been found that macroscopic regions of high densities are formed near the defect , much like a high density of cars behind a slow car in a traffic jam @xcite . here",
    "the phase separation is triggered by the defects .",
    "it is of interest to study whether phase separation can occur in @xmath0 noisy homogeneous systems such as on a ring geometry with no defects , where _ all _ possible local transition rates which are consistent with the symmetry and conservation laws of the model are non vanishing .",
    "recently , lahiri and ramaswamy have introduced a lattice model in the context of sedimenting colloidal crystals , where phase separation is found to take place without any inhomogeneities @xcite . in this model , there are two rings coupled to each other and particles on each ring undergo an asymmetric exclusion process .",
    "the hopping rate between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 on each ring depends on the occupation at the @xmath1th site on the other ring . however , this model is studied mainly using monte carlo simulations and no analytical results are available so far .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we introduced a simple three - species driven diffusive model exhibiting phase separation and spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry on a ring . in the model nearest - neighbor particles exchange with given rates and the numbers of each species are conserved under the dynamics .",
    "the rates of all local dynamical moves that obey the conservation laws are non zero .",
    "an argument indicating that generically the system phase separates , thus breaking the translational invariance , was given for the case when none of the species of particle has zero density .",
    "in the special case of equal number of particles of each type , it was shown that the local dynamics obeys detailed balance with respect to a long - range asymmetric ( chiral ) hamiltonian . in this special case ,",
    "using the hamiltonian , we have found the steady state of the model exactly and have been able to prove the existence of phase separation analytically .",
    "the existence of a hamiltonian for this special case is of interest in the light of speculation that non - equilibrium systems exhibiting generic long - range correlations might be described by effective hamiltonians containing long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "here we explicitly demonstrate that for the special case where the three densities are equal the model is exactly described by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian .",
    "the model not only has long - range correlations but has generic long - range _ order_. the mechanism found in this study suggests that systems with dynamical rules defined completely locally and _ a priori _ without respect to any hamiltonian , may have a steady state where the configuration space is sampled according to a measure that is intrinsically global .",
    "the hamiltonian also allows us to identify the analog of a temperature in the microscopic dynamics as related to the drive of the system ; for zero drive , that is symmetric diffusion of the particles , the effective temperature is infinite and phase separation is lost .",
    "we note that a related but distinct three - species model has recently been introduced by arndt _",
    "et al_. this model also exhibits phase separation@xcite .    in the present work we analyze in detail the @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xcite and then generalize it to larger @xmath4 .",
    "we provide the complete proof of phase separation which follows from the exact calculation of the partition sum in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also provide numerical evidence of phase separation in the general case where the densities of the three particles are not equal .    in order to study the coarsening process monte - carlo simulations",
    "are performed .",
    "however , simulation of the microscopic model is hampered by slow dynamics which makes it difficult to access the scaling regime .",
    "the system becomes trapped in metastable states comprising several domains of each type of particle .",
    "the number of metastable states is exponentially large in the system size .",
    "the lifetimes of the metastable states increase exponentially with the average domain size as the fully phase separated state is approached .",
    "thus the model provides an example of slow dynamics in a system without any quenched disorder @xcite .    to ameliorate the difficulty of numerically studying such slow dynamics we employ a toy model wherein it is the domains that are updated rather than the individual particles",
    "this allows the long - time scaling behavior of the domain size to be investigated and to confirm a logarithmic growth of the average domain size with time .",
    "the toy model also affords a mean - field solution for the long - time dynamical behavior , that again confirms the scaling behavior .    returning to the case of equal numbers of particles of different species it is of interest to investigate the steady - state behavior in finite - size systems .",
    "we have found it convenient to do this by employing a matrix product technique previously used to solve the steady state of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of three species the simplest form of this technique @xcite is applicable only to a limited class of systems @xcite . for the present model",
    "we generalize the matrix product to a product of rank 6 tensors and write the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions",
    "can be conveniently computed numerically using this tensor product ansatz .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species of particles has zero density . in section iii",
    "we study the special case where the model satisfies detailed balance and explicitly write down the steady - state weight for the three - species model .",
    "the existence of phase separation in the model for any non - infinite temperature is proved analytically by calculating some bounds on the two - point correlation functions .",
    "section iv contains numerical evidence for phase separation in the general case where the densities of the three species of particles are not equal . the toy model , which facilitates efficient monte carlo simulations , is used to study the dynamics of phase separation .",
    "a mean - field analysis of this toy model is presented , the details being left to appendix a. in section v we present results for finite systems obtained via the tensor product ansatz . using these results",
    "we study finite - size scaling in the system . in section",
    "vi we address phase separation in systems with more than three species of particle and a proof of detailed balance for special cases is given in appendix b. we conclude in section vii and discuss some open questions .",
    "we start by defining a three - species model which exhibits phase separation in @xmath0 . consider a one - dimensional , ring - like ( periodic ) lattice of length @xmath5 where each site is occupied by one of the three types of particles , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 .",
    "the model evolves under a random sequential update procedure which is defined as follows : at each time step two neighboring sites are chosen randomly and the particles at these sites are exchanged according to the following rates @xmath9 the particles thus diffuse asymmetrically around the ring .",
    "the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species .",
    "the @xmath12 case is special . here",
    "the diffusion is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move .",
    "the system thus obeys detailed balance reaching a steady state in which all microscopic configurations ( compatible with the number of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equally probable .",
    "this state is homogeneous , and no phase separation takes place .",
    "we now present a simple argument suggesting that for @xmath13 the steady state of the system is not homogeneous in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity the case @xmath14",
    "is examined . as a result of the bias in",
    "the exchange rates an @xmath6 particle prefers to move to the left inside a @xmath7 domain and to the right inside a @xmath8 domain .",
    "similarly the motion of @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles in foreign domains is biased .",
    "consider the dynamics starting from a random initial configuration .",
    "the configuration is composed of a random sequence of domains of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 particles . due to the bias",
    "a local configuration in which an @xmath6 domain is placed to the right of a @xmath7 domain is unstable and the two domains exchange places on a relatively short time scale which is linear in the domain size .",
    "similarly , @xmath15 and @xmath16 domains are unstable too . on the other hand @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 configurations are stable and long lived . thus after a relatively short time the system reaches a state of the type @xmath20 in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains are located to the right of @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .",
    "the evolution of this state takes place via a slow diffusion process in which , for example , the time scale for an @xmath6 particle to cross an adjacent @xmath7 domain is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the size of the @xmath7 domain .",
    "the system therefore coarsens and the average domain size increases with time as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "eventually the system phase separates into three domains of the three species of the form @xmath26 .    in a finite system",
    "the phase separated state may further evolve and become disordered due to fluctuations .",
    "however , the time scale for this to happen grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "for example it would take a time of order of @xmath27 for the @xmath6 domain in the totally phase separated state to break up into smaller domains .",
    "hence in the thermodynamic limit , this time scale diverges and the phase separated state remains stable provided the density of each species is non - zero .",
    "note that there are always small fluctuations about a totally phase separated state .",
    "however , these fluctuations affect the densities only near the domain boundaries . they result in a finite width for the domain walls .",
    "the fact that any phase separated state is stable for a time exponentially long in the system size amounts to a breaking of the translational symmetry .",
    "since the exchange rates are asymmetric , the system generically supports a particle current in the steady state . to see this ,",
    "consider the @xmath6 domain in the phase separated state .",
    "an @xmath6 particle near the @xmath28 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath7 domain to the right with an effective rate proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "once it crosses the @xmath7 domain it will move through the @xmath8 domain with rate @xmath30 . similarly an @xmath6 particle near the @xmath31 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath8 domain to the left with a rate proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "once the domain is crossed it moves through the @xmath7 domain with rate @xmath30 .",
    "hence the net @xmath6 particle current is of the order of @xmath33 . since this",
    "current is exponentially small in system size , it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . for the case of @xmath34",
    ", this argument suggests that the current is strictly zero for any @xmath5 . in sections iii and v we",
    "study this case in detail .",
    "the arguments presented above suggesting phase separation for @xmath35 may be easily extended to @xmath36 . in this case , however , the phase separated state is @xmath37 rather than @xmath38 .",
    "this may be seen by noting that the dynamical rules are invariant under the transformation @xmath39 together with @xmath40 .",
    "in this section we show that the dynamics ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , for the special case @xmath34 , satisfies detailed balance .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , which determines the steady - state distribution , is found to have long - range asymmetric interactions . using this hamiltonian ,",
    "we calculate analytically the partition sum and bounds on the correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these are then used to prove the existence of phase separation in the model . later ,",
    "in section [ matrixans ] we study finite systems for this case and the approach to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the general argument presented in the previous section suggests that for the special case @xmath34 , the steady state carries no current for any system size .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly by showing that the _ local dynamics _ of the model satisfies detailed balance with respect to a _ long - range asymmetric _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "we define the occupation variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 the variables @xmath45 and @xmath43 are defined similarly . clearly the relation @xmath46 is satisfied .",
    "a microscopic configuration is thus described by a set @xmath47 .",
    "using these variables , we will show that the hamiltonian @xmath41 and the steady - state distribution @xmath48 corresponding to the dynamics ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) for the case @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the partition sum given by @xmath53 , where the sum is over all configurations in which @xmath34 .",
    "note that the hamiltonian @xmath41 does not determine the dynamics of the system , it just governs the steady - state distribution as given in ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) and ( [ eq : weight ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : weight ] ) suggests that @xmath54 serves as a temperature variable with @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is the infinite - temperature limit .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is written in a form which is not manifestly translationally invariant .",
    "however , careful examination reveals that when the relation @xmath34 is taken into account , the hamiltonian as given by ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is indeed translationally invariant ( see appendix b ) .",
    "therefore site @xmath57 may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "an expression for @xmath41 which is manifestly translationally invariant will be derived at the end of this section .",
    "note that @xmath58 since the lhs yields the number of @xmath19 ( and @xmath15 ) pairs in the system . using this relation the hamiltonian may also be written in a form where the cyclic symmetry is more apparent : @xmath59-(n/3)^2 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the proof of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton],[eq : weight ] ) is straightforward .",
    "this is done by considering a nearest - neighbor particle exchange and verifying that detailed balance is satisfied with respect to ( [ eq : weight ] ) .",
    "we start by considering nearest - neighbor sites in the interior of the lattice , namely pairs other than @xmath60 .",
    "for example consider the exchange @xmath61 taking place at two adjacent sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "this exchange results in the contribution of one more @xmath65 term in @xmath66 and hence the energy of the resulting configuration is higher by @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see using eq .",
    "( [ eq : weight ] ) that @xmath67 , as required by detailed balance .",
    "similar relations are easily derived for exchange of @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs .",
    "now consider an exchange taking place between sites @xmath5 and @xmath57 , say @xmath68 . according to ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) this exchange costs an energy of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the exchange satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath70 only when @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , by considering the exchanges @xmath72 and @xmath73 , one deduces that the detailed balance condition is satisfied for any exchange at sites @xmath5 and @xmath57 as long as @xmath34 . in appendix b we consider the most general nearest - neighbor exchange rates for @xmath4 species and arbitrary densities and derive conditions ( [ condition ] ) for exchange rates which satisfy detailed balance .    to write @xmath41 in a manifestly translationally invariant form we define @xmath74 as the hamiltonian in which site @xmath75 is the origin .",
    "namely , @xmath76 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the summation over @xmath1 and @xmath77 is modulo @xmath5 . summing ( [ hi0 ] ) over all @xmath75 and",
    "dividing by @xmath5 , one obtains , @xmath78 where in the summation the value of the site index @xmath79 is modulo @xmath5 . in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_tinvar ] ) the interaction is linear in the distance between the particles , and",
    "thus is long - ranged .",
    "the distance is measured in a preferred direction from site @xmath1 to site @xmath80 .",
    "moreover it is asymmetric in the sense that @xmath66 is not invariant under the parity operation .",
    "it is also related to chiral hamiltonians @xcite .      before proceeding further to evaluate the partition sum and some correlation functions associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] )",
    "let us make a few observations .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian is given by the fully separated state @xmath81 and its translationally related states .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state is thus @xmath5 and its energy is zero .",
    "a simple way of evaluating the energy of an arbitrary configuration is obtained by noting that nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchanges @xmath82 and @xmath83 cost one unit of energy each while the reverse exchanges result in an energy gain of one unit .",
    "the energy of an arbitrary configuration may thus be evaluated by starting with the ground state and performing nn exchanges until the configuration is reached , keeping track of the energy changes at each step of the way .",
    "the highest energy is @xmath84 and it corresponds to the totally phase separated configuration @xmath85 and its @xmath5 translations .    in considering the excited states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] )",
    "we note that the model exhibits a set of metastable states which correspond to local minima of the energy : any exchange of nn particles results in an increase of the energy . in these states",
    "no @xmath86 and @xmath15 nn pairs exist ; only @xmath87 and @xmath19 nn pairs may be found in addition to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "any metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains follow @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .",
    "therefore each metastable state has an equal number of domains , @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath93 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath94 corresponds to the @xmath95 state , composed of a total of @xmath5 domains each of length @xmath57 .",
    "( the total number of domains in an @xmath91-state is @xmath96 . )    for calculating the free energy and some correlation functions corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) we find it useful to first derive some bounds for the number @xmath97 of @xmath91-states and their energies . in the following such bounds are presented .",
    "they are then used , in the next section , to evaluate the free energy and correlation functions of the model .    to obtain a bound for @xmath97",
    "we note that the number of ways of dividing @xmath98 @xmath6 particles into @xmath91 domains is @xmath99 .",
    "the number of ways of combining @xmath91 divisions of each of the three types of particles is clearly @xmath100 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "there are at most @xmath5 ways of placing this string of domains on a lattice to obtain a metastable state ( the number of ways need not be equal to @xmath5 since the string may possess some translational symmetry ) .",
    "one therefore has @xmath101 ^ 3 \\le{\\cal n}(s ) \\le n \\left[{n/3 - 1}\\choose { s-1}\\right]^3\\ ; . \\label{nmss}\\ ] ] thus , the total number of metastable states is exponential in @xmath5 .",
    "we now consider the energy of the metastable states .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that among all @xmath91-states , none has energy lower than the following configuration , @xmath102 where the @xmath103 rightmost domains are of size @xmath57 and the three leftmost domains are of size @xmath104 each .",
    "the energy of this state , @xmath105 satisfies the following recursion relation @xmath106 with @xmath107 . to see this",
    "one notes that the @xmath91-state may be created from the @xmath108-state by first moving a @xmath7 particle from the leftmost @xmath7 domain across @xmath109 @xmath8 particles to the right and then moving an @xmath6 particle from the leftmost @xmath6 domain to the right across the adjacent @xmath7 and @xmath8 domains .",
    "the energy cost of these moves is @xmath109 , yielding ( [ rr ] ) .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ rr ] ) , together with @xmath110 , is then readily solved to give @xmath111 the energy of all metastable @xmath91-states is larger or equal to @xmath105 as given by eq.([emss ] ) . in the following section we use the bounds ( [ nmss ] ) and ( [ emss ] ) to calculate the partition sum and some correlation functions corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) .",
    "in this section we prove that , in the large @xmath5 limit and for all @xmath35 , the partition sum is given by @xmath112 ^ 3 \\ ; , \\label{psum}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 the partition sum for @xmath36 may be obtained by replacing @xmath54 by @xmath114 in ( [ psum ] ) . note that the partition sum is linear and not exponential in @xmath5 , meaning that the free energy is not extensive .",
    "this is a result of the long - range interaction in the hamiltonian and the fact that the energy excitations are localized near the domain boundaries , as will be shown in the following .",
    "for @xmath54 close to @xmath57 , @xmath115 has an essential singularity , @xmath116}\\;.\\ ] ] this suggests that extensivity of the free energy could be restored in the double limit @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 finite .",
    "this scaling behavior is only suggestive since expression ( [ psum ] ) may not be valid in this limit . for @xmath12 all configurations with @xmath34",
    "are equally probable , so that the partition sum is given by @xmath120 which goes like @xmath121 for large @xmath5 .",
    "it is instructive to first present the proof of ( [ psum ] ) for small values of @xmath54 .",
    "this proof will then serve as the basis for the proof for any @xmath35 .",
    "we start by noting that in calculating the partition sum ( [ psum ] ) , configurations with energy larger then @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) may be neglected in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity",
    "we first demonstrate this for @xmath124 , although later we show it for any @xmath35 .",
    "the contribution to the partition sum from these energy states , @xmath125 , is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of configurations of energy @xmath128 .",
    "clearly , the number of possible configurations in the system is bounded crudely from above by @xmath121 .",
    "this bound implies @xmath129 thus , for @xmath124 , the contribution to the partition sum arising from energies larger than @xmath122 is exponentially small in @xmath5 and may be neglected in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the calculation of @xmath52 is thus reduced to calculating a truncated partition sum in which only energies up to @xmath122 are summed over . to proceed we consider @xmath130 and take into account configurations with energy less than @xmath131 .",
    "this simplifies the calculations considerably since all configurations with energy @xmath132 may be decomposed into @xmath5 disjoint sets of states , each corresponding to a unique ground state ( see previous section for a discussion of ground states ) .",
    "we label the sets by @xmath133 , the position of the rightmost @xmath6 particle in the @xmath6 domain of the ground state belonging to the set ( see fig .",
    "[ ground ] for an example of an @xmath134 ground state ) .",
    "each state in a specific set can be obtained from the corresponding ground state by exchanging nearest neighbors so that the energy always increases along the intermediate states .",
    "note that this is correct only if excitations of energy less than @xmath131 are considered .",
    "this is because not all higher energy states can be reached by uphill steps from a ground state .",
    "thus , using translational invariance , the partition sum can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the truncated partition sum of one of the @xmath5 sets of configurations .",
    "we proceed to calculate @xmath136 .",
    "this is done by considering all the possible energy excitations with energy less than @xmath131 above one ground state . consider a specific domain boundary , say @xmath17 .",
    "excitations of energy @xmath128 at this boundary can be created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath7 particles into the @xmath6 domain ) .",
    "an @xmath6 particle moving into the @xmath7 domain is considered as a walker .",
    "the excitation energy increases linearly with the distance the walker has moved .",
    "thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 is created by @xmath137 walkers , traveling a total distance @xmath128 .",
    "the number of excitations of energy @xmath128 is then given by the number of ways , @xmath138 , of partitioning an integer @xmath128 into the sum of a sequence of non - increasing positive integers .",
    "taking into account excitations at all three boundaries , an excitation of energy @xmath128 in the system is created by three independent excitations of energy @xmath139 and @xmath140 at the different domain boundaries such that @xmath141 .",
    "the number of excitations of this form is just given by @xmath142 .",
    "thus , @xmath136 is given by @xmath143 taking the thermodynamic limit we obtain @xmath144 using a well known result from number theory , attributed to euler , for the generating function of @xmath138 @xcite , @xmath145 and using ( [ thelim ] ) and ( [ exp ] ) , eq.([psum ] ) is obtained .",
    "so far we have proved that for @xmath146 , eq.([psum ] ) is exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we now extend these results for any @xmath35 .",
    "first we have to show that the states ignored in the previous calculation for @xmath146 may be ignored for all @xmath35 .",
    "to do this we calculate upper and lower bounds on @xmath52 and show they converge for large enough @xmath5 .    for this",
    "we have to consider the entire energy spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "any configuration of the system which is neither a ground state nor a metastable state can be obtained from at least one ground state ( @xmath93 ) or a metastable state ( @xmath147 ) as follows : starting from this @xmath91-state exchange nearest neighbors such that the energy always increases along the path until the configuration is reached . in what follows it",
    "is demonstrated that none of the configurations which can be obtained from @xmath91-states , with @xmath147 , by the above procedure of particle exchange , contributes to the partition sum in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an upper bound on the partition sum may be calculated as follows : using the same steps of derivation used for computing @xmath136 , it is straightforward to show that the contribution to the partition sum from an @xmath91-state and associated configurations is _ at most _",
    "@xmath148^{-3s}$ ] .",
    "the prefactor @xmath149 arises from the minimum energy ( [ emss ] ) of this metastable state .",
    "therefore by considering the contributions from all the @xmath91-states and using ( [ nmeta ] ) the following bound is found @xmath150 ^ 3 + \\sum_{s=2}^{n/3}n { n/3 - 1\\choose s-1 } q^{(s-1)n/3 -s(s-1)/2 } [ ( q_{\\infty})]^{-3s}\\;. \\label{zupperb1}\\ ] ] the second term on the rhs represents the contribution from excitations around the metastable states .",

    "using these recursion relations we have calculated the correlation function @xmath395 , which is a measure of the phase separation in the system , for various system sizes .",
    "when @xmath396 is close to zero the system is phase separated . in the disordered case , @xmath12 , the value of the correlation function is @xmath397 , approaching @xmath398 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ order ] one can see that the system is phase separated for small values of @xmath54 while for @xmath54 close to @xmath57 the system is disordered .",
    "the range of @xmath54 values for which the system is phase separated increases as the system size increases .",
    "the natural scaling variable near the critical point @xmath12 is @xmath399 , the ratio between the domain size @xmath98 and the domain wall width @xmath400 . in fig.([order ] ) the correlation function is plotted as a function of the scaling variable .",
    "one can see that the data collapse improves as the system size increases .",
    "this scaling variable was also suggested by the form of the partition function ( [ psum ] ) in section iii c.",
    "in the following we discuss possible generalization of the model to @xmath401 species . to demonstrate how this might be done we first discuss the case @xmath402 .",
    "we then comment briefly on @xmath403 .",
    "we now define a @xmath180-species model and argue that it phase separates .",
    "consider a ring where each site is occupied by either an @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath404 particle .",
    "the model evolves according to the following procedure : at each time step two nearest neighbors are chosen randomly and exchanged according to the rates ,    @xmath405    as before the model conserves the number of particles of each species .",
    "note that several other generalizations of the model to four species are possible .",
    "however , for simplicity , we discuss only the model defined by ( [ eq : four ] ) with @xmath35 .",
    "we now argue that the system phase separates into a configuration of the form @xmath406 ( where each letter now indicates a domain ) as long as the densities of particles of each species are non - zero .",
    "note that in the model @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath407 , @xmath408 , @xmath15 and @xmath409 boundaries are stable while reverse boundaries @xmath410 , @xmath16 , @xmath411 , @xmath412 , @xmath19 and @xmath413 are unstable . as in the case of the three species model the system , starting from a random initial condition , evolves on a short time scale ( _ i.e. _ , which is not determined by the size of the system ) into a metastable configuration where only stable domains are present .",
    "this configuration then slowly coarsens by slow diffusion of particles through neighboring domains",
    ". the system will finally reach the most stable state where the number of domains is minimal . one can easily check that this configuration is given by @xmath406 .",
    "note that the system may exhibit other metastable states .",
    "for example , a state composed of @xmath414 is also stable under the choice of rates ( [ eq : four ] ) .",
    "however , since this state is composed of more domains than the @xmath180-domain state , some of the domains are necessarily smaller .",
    "according to the argument presented in section ii the relaxation time of this sequence ( proportional to @xmath415 where @xmath128 is the typical domain size ) is much shorter than the relaxation time of the @xmath180-domain state .",
    "therefore the @xmath180-domain state is more stable so that the system will finally evolve into it .    in considering @xmath403 models",
    "one finds that for some choices of transition rates several states with the minimum number of domains may become metastable .",
    "for example , for @xmath416 it is possible to choose transition rates for which both @xmath417 and @xmath418 are locally stable . the relative stability ( and",
    "thus the resulting phase separated state ) may be found by determining the relaxation time of these states using simple considerations such as those presented in section ii .    as is the case of @xmath3 detailed balance",
    "is found to be satisfied for certain densities and transition rates for @xmath419 .",
    "the condition for this is derived in appendix [ dbappen ] . in this case",
    "the relative stability of metastable states could be determined by comparing free energies .",
    "in this paper a model of three species of particles diffusing on a ring previously introduced in @xcite has been studied .",
    "the model is governed by local dynamics in which all moves compatible with the conservation of the three densities are allowed .",
    "we argue that phase separation should occur as long as all densities are non - zero . in the special case of equal densities",
    "we find that the steady state generated by the local stochastic dynamics is exactly given by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian .",
    "phase separation for this case is explicitly demonstrated .",
    "the model provides an explicit example for the mechanism leading to phase separation or breaking of ergodicity in systems with _",
    "local _ stochastic dynamics .",
    "although we did not succeed in solving the steady state in the case of non - equal densities of particles , there is a strong evidence that phase separation still occurs . in order to investigate further the case of equal densities we employed a generalized matrix ansatz to calculate correlation function for finite - size systems .",
    "the novel structure of the ansatz may give some clue as to handle other @xmath0 models which have so far resisted solution .",
    "the dynamics of phase separation reduces to a coarsening problem where the typical domain size grows logarithmically in time .",
    "this results from the elimination of the domains at a rate exponentially small in their size .",
    "the slow dynamics poses a problem of how to access the scaling regime numerically . with direct numerical simulations",
    "only small systems can be studied ( see fig .",
    "however , by employing a toy model in which domains rather than individual sites are updated one can simulate much larger systems and probe the scaling regime ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "such ideas of updating domains have been used before in the study of coarsening @xcite . with the aid of the toy model it should be possible to study other aspects of the scaling regime associated with the slow dynamics and",
    "escape from metastable states .",
    "generalizations are possible to models with @xmath419 species .",
    "we have discussed some possibilities and have shown that phase separation may take place , although the structure of the set of metastable states is more complicated . as was the case for @xmath3 , conditions for detailed balance with respect to a long - range hamiltonian may be determined .",
    "the problem of phase separation and coarsening is of interest also in the broader context of phase transitions in one dimensional systems . here",
    "the existence of conserved quantities results in certain local transition rates being zero",
    ". it would be interesting to generalize this study to models in which no conserved quantity exists and all local rates are non - vanishing . also , another open problem is to calculate the steady state of the present model in the case of non - equal densities .",
