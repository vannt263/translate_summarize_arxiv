    "the investigation of strangeness contributions to static properties of the nucleon is particularly interesting as it gives unambiguous access to low - energy manifestations of virtual or sea quark effects .",
    "different strangeness currents of the form @xmath1 test the strangeness component of different nucleon observables , such as mass ( @xmath2 ) , spin ( @xmath3 ) , or magnetic moment ( @xmath4 ) . here",
    "we are concerned with the magnetic moment only , or , more generally , with the nucleon form factors of the vector current .",
    "the standard model provides access to two different flavor combinations of the three light quark contributions to the electric ( @xmath5 ) and magnetic ( @xmath6 ) form factors due to the electromagnetic and the weak vector currents , @xmath7 -1 mm in order to obtain a full flavor decomposition of the vector current , one therefore has to invoke isospin ( or charge ) symmetry in the form @xmath8 and use the neutron electromagnetic form factors as the third input .",
    "these relations are at the heart of the extensive experimental program to extract the _ weak _ form factors of the proton @xmath9 from parity - violating electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "if one relaxes this assumption and allows for charge - symmetry breaking , however , the relation between weak vector form factors , electromagnetic form factors of proton and neutron , and strangeness is complicated by an additional term , @xmath10 where @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "the charge - symmetry - violating form factors @xmath12 generate `` pseudo - strangeness '' , and in order to reliably extract strangeness effects , the former have to be calculated from theory . this is becoming a necessity in particular in view of the increasingly tighter bounds on strangeness deduced from experiment  @xcite .",
    "the isospin - breaking form factors @xmath12 have been addressed in various models of the strong interactions , in particular in constituent quark  @xcite or light - cone meson  baryon models  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparative review ) .",
    "these are afflicted by several problems : first , as in general with model calculations , it is extremely difficult to quantify the inherent uncertainties ; second , the symmetries of the standard model may be violated .",
    "e.g. , quark models  @xcite predict @xmath13 for the charge - symmetry breaking magnetic moment , which is only due to a specific symmetry of the quark model wave function employed , not , as we shall see below , due to a symmetry of the standard model , and may consequently lead to an underestimation of isospin - breaking effects in particular at small @xmath14 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , on the other hand , is ideally suited for an analysis of isospin violation .",
    "it is tailor - made to analyze the dependence of low - energy observables on quark masses , in particular on the light quark mass difference @xmath15 , and the consistent inclusion of electromagnetic effects is also well - understood  @xcite . as the isospin - violating form factors can be calculated in su(2 ) chpt , they are not affected by convergence problems to the extent the strangeness form factors are ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on the latter ) .    particular emphasis will be put on the analysis of the leading moments of the isospin - violating form factors , magnetic moment as well as electric and magnetic radius terms , @xmath16 the two radius terms are unaffected by low - energy constants up to leading ( @xmath17 ) and next - to - leading ( @xmath18 ) order and can be expressed entirely in terms of the neutron - to - proton mass difference @xmath19  @xcite , with the result  @xcite @xmath20 note that these expressions for the radii are entirely non - analytic in the quark masses .",
    "their simplicity is remarkable : the pion mass difference @xmath21 can not play a role as it only breaks charge _ independence _ , not charge symmetry ; furthermore , up to @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , no photon loops contribute , nor are there any two - loop effects .",
    "in fact , chpt is more predictive here than for the usual electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , precisely because polynomial counterterm contributions must be suppressed by isospin - breaking factors @xmath15 or @xmath26 , and hence by two orders in the chiral expansion .    in order to complete the chiral representation",
    ", we have to estimate the combination of low - energy constants entering @xmath27 .",
    "this is done by invoking the principle of resonance saturation : low - energy constants in effective theories incorporate the effects of heavier states not included in the theory as explicit degrees of freedom . in our case ,",
    "the relevant contributions are provided by vector mesons including @xmath28 mixing  @xcite : @xmath29 ~ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_m^{u , d}(t ) \\bigr|_{\\rm mix } & = &       \\frac{\\theta_{\\rho\\omega}}{m_v(m_v^2-t)^2 }       \\bigl [       \\bigl(t + \\kappa_\\omega m_v^2\\bigr)g_\\omega f_\\rho     - \\bigl(t + \\kappa_\\rho m_v^2\\bigr)g_\\rho f_\\omega       \\bigr ] ~. \\label{eq : mix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the necessary couplings can be extracted from experimental data within certain errors .",
    "such an inclusion of phenomenological vector - meson contributions has been shown to cure the main deficits of a chiral one - loop representation of the usual nucleon electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , and is expected to work even better here due to the stronger suppression of even higher mass states in the mixing amplitudes .",
    "still , the uncertainties in particular in the vector - meson  nucleon coupling constants @xmath30 , @xmath31  @xcite limit the precision of the prediction for the isospin - violating form factors ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "although , strictly speaking , the chiral representation of the form factors to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) only requires an estimate for the low - energy constant entering the isospin - violating magnetic moment , the representation eq .   also allows to assess higher - order counterterms contributing to the radii .",
    "numerically one finds that , although formally subleading , the large vector - meson couplings tend to overwhelm the loop contributions eq .   in the radii , which scale with the ( small ) nucleon mass difference .",
    "we therefore include the full mixing amplitudes in the final predictions .",
    "the total results for the charge - symmetry - breaking form factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffresults ] .",
    "the error bands combine an estimate of chiral corrections at higher order with the above - mentioned uncertainties in the input coupling constants for the resonance contributions .",
    "although these combined uncertainties are sizeable , several conclusions can still be drawn : the effects of isospin breaking remain at the percent level ; the @xmath14-dependence of the form factors is rather moderate in the low - energy region .",
    "we note that the symmetries of the standard model do _ not _ dictate @xmath27 to vanish , indeed we find @xmath32 .    the validity of these results , and in particular of the prediction for @xmath33  @xcite , has been criticized as an `` extreme estimate '' in ref .",
    "@xcite and too large in comparison to ref .",
    "@xcite ; in particular the input on @xmath34 , @xmath35  @xcite has been questioned .",
    "this criticism is unwarranted for the following reasons .",
    "the central value for @xmath27 is due to pion - loop contributions at a scale @xmath36 , where changing the scale by a factor of 2 leads to a shift of @xmath37 only .",
    "completely scale - independent is the next - to - leading order correction in @xmath27 ( which is @xmath38 , hence non - analytic in the quark masses ) , which can be read off as the difference between the full and the dashed curve in the magnetic form factor in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffresults ] , and which contributes roughly 40% of the central value .",
    "the potentially controversial vector meson contributions only lead to the uncertainty range of @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , the large anomalous @xmath40 coupling found in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to the _ lower _ edge of the band in @xmath25 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ffresults ] , hence to a sizeable cancellation with the pion - loop terms ; reducing these couplings makes the total result larger , not smaller .",
    "quite to the contrary , the quark model results for @xmath25  @xcite are too small at low @xmath14 by wrongly enforcing @xmath41 to vanish .",
    "cccc experiment & electric / magnetic & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + sample & @xmath6 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + a4 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + happex & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 +    table  [ tab : results ] compares the specific linear combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath25 at @xmath52 with the experimentally extracted values for strangeness form factors .",
    "we find that the charge - symmetry - breaking shifts are still smaller than other experimental uncertainties , but should be kept in mind for precision determinations of strange matrix elements . as another illustration , in the latest combined analysis of forward and backward asymmetries at a4  @xcite ,",
    "the following values for the strange form factors were extracted at @xmath53 : @xmath54 isospin breaking shifts the central values according to @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , with negligible additional errors due to the theoretical uncertainties of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "again , these shifts are within the given error bars , but already of a comparable size .",
    "parity - violating electron scattering on @xmath61he gives clean access to the strange _ electric _ form factor @xmath56 , as the @xmath62 target does not allow for magnetic or axial vector transitions .",
    "however , in addition to effects of charge - symmetry breaking in the electric form factor as discussed in the previous section , an @xmath63 admixture in the @xmath61he wave function yields a contribution to the measured asymmetry @xmath64  @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the nuclear form factors corresponding to isoscalar / isovector charge operators , and @xmath67 is a different isospin - breaking linear combination of single - nucleon form factors .",
    "the measured asymmetry @xmath68 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] at @xmath69  gev@xmath70 @xcite leads to @xmath71 .",
    "single - nucleon isospin violation contributes @xmath72 to @xmath73 , while isospin mixing in the @xmath61he wave function amounts to @xmath74 , leaving a mere strangeness contribution of @xmath75 .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the charge - symmetry - breaking nucleon form factors , using a combination of chiral perturbation theory and resonance saturation that relies as far as possible on the symmetries of the standard model and experimental data .",
    "although we predict the isospin - breaking magnetic moment @xmath76 to be different from zero ( in contrast to certain model predictions ) , both electric and magnetic form factors are small , and their momentum - transfer dependence moderate .",
    "the contributions of isospin violation to parity - violating asymmetries are as yet smaller than some of the experimental uncertainties in extracting strange form factors , but clearly , charge - symmetry - breaking effects become an essential ingredient for precision extractions of strangeness matrix elements .",
