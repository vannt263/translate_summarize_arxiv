    "in recent years , the study of entanglement in quantum many - body systems has become a common issue in condensed matter physics , statistical mechanics , and quantum information theory .",
    "entanglement is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which quantum systems are linked together even when they are spatially separated so that one system can not be correctly described without full mention of its counterpart .",
    "this concept was first introduced by schrdinger in  @xcite . from the viewpoint of quantum information science",
    ", entanglement is a fundamental measure of how much quantum effects we can observe and use to control one quantum system by another , and it is the primary resource for quantum information processing and communication  @xcite . on the other hand , in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics , the concept of quantum entanglement has recently been used to investigate quantum phase transitions  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) , topological order  @xcite , and macroscopic properties of solids  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental and practical problem common in all the areas is how to detect entanglement  @xcite and quantify the degree of it .",
    "a general approach is to study the reduced density matrix of a certain subsystem in an entangled state .",
    "the concept of the reduced density matrix was first introduced by dirac in  @xcite .",
    "there are many kinds of measures of entanglement related to the reduced density matrix ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . among them , one of the most popular characteristic functions is the von neumann entropy ( entanglement entropy ) of a reduced density matrix  @xcite .",
    "it serves as the measure of entanglement for a pure state .    generally speaking , to elucidate quantum entanglement in many - body systems is a formidable task since we need a precise description of many - body quantum states .",
    "so far , much insight has been obtained by studying exactly solvable models in which there is a possibility to obtain the reduced density matrix and calculate the von neumann entropy exactly or approximately .",
    "representative models are the harmonic models  @xcite , the xy spin chain  @xcite , the xxz spin chain  @xcite , the calogero - sutherland model  @xcite , one - dimensional critical models  @xcite , conformal field theories  @xcite , the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model  @xcite , the kitaev model  @xcite , and the quantum dimer ( rokhsar - kivelson ) model  @xcite . among them",
    ", the aklt model  @xcite has some important meanings since this model is directly related to one of the schemes of quantum computation , measurement based quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "historically , the aklt model and its exact ground state known as the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) state were proposed to understand ground - state properties of the haldane gap systems  @xcite .",
    "the authors ( aklt ) rigorously proved that the vbs state is a unique ground state and there is an energy gap immediately above the ground state .",
    "exponential decay of correlation functions in the vbs ground state has also been shown .",
    "there is an intimate relation between the vbs states and fractional quantum hall states which has been revealed by using a spin coherent state representation  @xcite .",
    "a hidden topological order in the vbs state is characterized by string order parameters  @xcite and existence of edge states which are degenerate ground states in a chain with open boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the vbs picture and the edge states were also experimentally supported by electron spin resonance ( esr ) in the @xmath1 haldane chain ni(c@xmath2h@xmath3n@xmath2)@xmath2no@xmath2(clo@xmath4 ) ( nenp )  @xcite .",
    "although most of the exactly solvable models are limited to one dimension , the aklt model and vbs ground state can be generalized to higher dimensions and/or inhomogeneous ( non - translational invariant ) lattices  @xcite .",
    "this feature is especially important in connection with the measurement based quantum computation as we discussed later . for studying nature of the vbs states ,",
    "the non - trivial observation has been done by klmper _",
    "et al_. , through the @xmath5-deformation of the aklt model  @xcite .",
    "they found that the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1 vbs state can be expressed in a form of the matrix product state ( mps ) .",
    "this representation gives an efficient method to calculate correlation functions . mathematical theory and generalization of the vbs states ,",
    "i.e. , finitely correlated states ( fcs ) , were essentially developed by fannes _",
    "et al_. , in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting generalization of the vbs state is to replace su(2 ) spins with other lie algebra generators . in this direction , there have been constructed many versions of the aklt model such as su(3 )  @xcite and su(@xmath6 ) modes  @xcite , su(@xmath7)-extended model  @xcite , symplectic model  @xcite , so(5 ) model  @xcite , so(@xmath8 ) model  @xcite , supersymmetric model  @xcite , and several @xmath5-deformations  @xcite .",
    "the vbs state has recently been attracting renewed interest from the viewpoint of quantum information theory .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed that the vbs state can be used as a resource state in measurement - based quantum computation ( mqc ) .",
    "mqc is one of the schemes of quantum computation in which we can perform universal quantum computation using only measurements as computational steps ( see  @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "there are two kinds of measurement based models .",
    "one is the teleportation quantum computation ( tqc )  @xcite .",
    "the other is the so - called one - way quantum computation ( 1wqc ) or cluster state computation  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "any quantum gate array can be implemented as a pattern of single - qubit measurement on a highly entangled cluster state .",
    "note that 1wqc with one - dimensional cluster states is insufficient for universal quantum computation and thus two - dimensional cluster states are inevitably needed .",
    "it has then been proved in  @xcite by verstraete and cirac that tqc and 1wqc are equivalent using the vbs picture .",
    "gross , eisert and collaborators have introduced novel schemes for mqc based on finitely correlated or tensor network state beyond the cluster state  @xcite .",
    "another recent important development by brennen and miyake is that the vbs state ( more precisely dynamically coupled aklt chains ) can be used as a resource state in mqc instead of the cluster state  @xcite .",
    "the vbs state is more advantageous to 1wqc than the cluster state since it is robust against noise due to the energy gap .",
    "implementations of the aklt hamiltonian using bosonic atoms  @xcite or spin-1 polar molecules  @xcite in optical lattices have also been proposed .    in this paper , motivated by considerable current interest from several viewpoints ,",
    "we study entanglement properties of vbs states on two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphs which is relevant to mqc . before discussing the 2d vbs states ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the obtained results in 1d vbs states .",
    "the reduced density matrix and entanglement properties in the 1d spin-1 vbs state was first studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the von neumann entropy of the block with the rest of the chain approaches a constant value exponentially fast , as the size of the block increases .",
    "the constant value is given by @xmath9 .",
    "then , the 1d integer-@xmath10 vbs states were studied in  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the von neumann entropy of the large block with the rest is given by @xmath11 and this value is interpreted in terms of the edge states , the degenerate ground states of the open aklt chain .",
    "this picture leads to an idea that the reduced density matrix of the block in the aklt chain is _ exactly _ spanned by the degenerate ground states of the block hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( [ block_ham ] ) for the definition ) .",
    "this idea has been confirmed in the series of papers  @xcite and was summarized in the review  @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantities such as the entanglement length  @xcite , the geometric entanglement  @xcite , the single - copy entanglement  @xcite , and the boundary effect  @xcite in the 1d spin-1 vbs state have also been studied .",
    "more generally , the entanglement of formation in the 1d fcs was estimated in  @xcite and an area law in 1d gapped quantum system was proven in  @xcite . compared to the 1d vbs states , few results have been obtained in 2d vbs states so far .",
    "entanglement properties of the vbs state on the cayley tree  @xcite was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the von neumann entropy of the block does not depend on the whole size of the system and its asymptotic value is linearly proportional to the number of valence bonds crossing the boundary .",
    "this gives an explicit proof of the area law in this system ( see  @xcite for a review of area laws and the entanglement entropy ) .",
    "general entanglement properties of the vbs state on an arbitrary graph  @xcite have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the eigenspace of the reduced density matrix of the block is spanned by the degenerate ground states of the block hamiltonian .",
    "the authors have shown that the von neumann entropy of a large block with the rest approaches a value less than @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ground - state degeneracy of the block hamiltonian .",
    "although some general results for 2d vbs states have been obtained so far , a quantitative analysis of entanglement was missing since a powerful analytical method such as a transfer matrix technique does not work sufficiently in the analysis of 2d systems .",
    "therefore , entanglement properties of the 2d vbs states must be analyzed with the aid of numerics .    in this paper , we study entanglement properties of the 2d vbs states on symmetric graphs .",
    "symmetries such as reflection and inversion enable us to develop an efficient method to study the reduced density matrix .",
    "due to the symmetry , one can find the relation between the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and those of the _ overlap _ matrix ( see eqs .",
    "( [ overlap1]-[overlap2 ] ) for the definition ) .",
    "the overlap matrix is a real symmetric and its elements are given by the inner product of the degenerate ground states of the block hamiltonian which are linearly independent but may not be orthonormal .",
    "the inner product can be , for example , calculated by monte carlo integration using the schwinger boson representation of the vbs state . even without numerical integration , one can formally write the overlap matrix as a matrix - valued correlation function in the vbs state restricted to one of the subsystems . from this , we conjecture that the von neumann entropy per valence bond ( boundary site ) is strictly less than @xmath0 even in the 2d infinite system .",
    "holographic _ interpretation of the deviation from @xmath0 is given in terms of the hidden spin chain along the boundary between two subsystems ( reflection axis ) . to confirm this conjecture , we numerically study the eigenvalues of the overlap matrix by exact diagonalization . since the dimension of the overlap matrix does not depend on the size of the whole system but is given by @xmath13 , we can study relatively large systems .",
    "from the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , we calculate the von neumann entropy .",
    "we find that the von neumann entropy per valence bond on the boundary is strictly less than @xmath0 for finite size systems .",
    "we also find a function which fits the obtained numerical results well .",
    "the long - distance behavior of this function strongly supports our conjecture .",
    "these numerical results are analytically or algebraically confirmed for the graphs with a ladder geometry , where transfer matrix technique can be applied .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the construction of the aklt model on an arbitrary graph and introduce the schwinger boson representation of the vbs state . in section 3",
    ", we provide a general argument on the schmidt decomposition and discuss a relation between the reduced density matrix and the overlap matrix .",
    "we show how to apply this method to study the von neumann entropy of the vbs state .",
    "then we make a conjecture on the von neumann entropy in the 2d infinite system . in section 4 ,",
    "numerical results of the vbs states on the square and hexagonal lattices are shown . in section 5 , the obtained numerical results",
    "are partly confirmed analytically for graphs in a ladder geometry .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section . in appendix , we provide a graphical interpretation of the overlap matrix in terms of closed loops and open strands .",
    "let us first define the _ basic _ aklt model on a connected graph . a graph consists of two types of elements , namely vertices ( sites ) and edges ( bonds ) . as shown in fig .",
