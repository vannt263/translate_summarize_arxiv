    "[ figchi_one_0.01 ] .",

    "we exchange the neighboring bonds sequentially from the left .",
    "if the two bonds are the same , we skip to the next .",
    "we choose a new configuration of bonds by the thermal bath algorithm , i.e. , we take the exchanged configuration with the probability : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the boltzmann weight for the original bond configuration and @xmath109 is that of the exchanged configuration for the given spin configuration @xmath110 : @xmath108=@xmath111 and @xmath109=@xmath112 .",
    "we plot the distribution of the distance between the impurity bonds in fig .",
    "[ figforce60 ] .",
    "we expect that the distribution should be the canonical distribution with the potential energy of the interaction of the impurities .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ figforce60 ] that the most probable distance is @xmath113 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath113 gives the lowest energy . when @xmath105 is odd , the probability is low , which indicates that the energies for odd - distances are higher than those for even - distances . among the even @xmath105s , the probability decreases as",
    "the distance becomes long , which indicates the attractive force acts .",
    "we also studied the case of weak impurity bond and found that the attractive force acts similarly to the case of the strong impurity bonds .      in the alternate chain ( @xmath114 )",

    "@xmath115 if we shift the position furthermore , the system has a configuration @xmath116 etc .",

    "[ fig_force_alt_diag ] we plot the ground state energy as a function of @xmath105 obtained by exact diagonalization for @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . here",
    "we find again an attractive force between the impurities .",
    "in this paper we explored effects of various bond impurities on the low temperature magnetic properties in the uniform and bond - alternating antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains .",
    "in particular we clarified the temperature dependence of the magnetic structure of the open uniform chain . at modestly low temperatures systems",
    "show a similar local susceptibility profile regardless of whether the number of spins is even or odd . on the other hand at very low temperatures ,",
    "the profile is very different from each other .",
    "we also studied domain structures which are separated by bond impurities in the uniform chain .",
    "there we found that each domain behaves almost independently at modestly low temperatures .",
    "however , at very low temperatures in the domain with even number of spins , a magnetic structure appears due to the interaction between the domains , although such structure does not exist in a completely isolated open chain with even number of spins .",
    "thus the interaction between the domains is not negligible at very low temperatures .",
    "we also found that the interactions between domains with odd number of spins can be approximately modeled by a simple system with @xmath0 spins representing the domain magnetization .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath71 of the model is not necessarily small at @xmath26 .",
    "because the energy gap due to the finite size in the uniform chain is proportional to @xmath51 , we expect that @xmath71 also becomes small as @xmath51 .",
    "effect of bond impurities are investigated also in the bond - alternating chain .",
    "the role of the bond impurity is very different from that in the uniform chain , i.e. bond impurities induce a magnetic structure around them , while they cause the division into domains in the uniform chain . in the bond - alternating chain",
    "the effect is quite similar to that of the site impurities of @xmath0 in the @xmath2 antiferromagnetic chain because of the gapful nature . here",
    "induction of magnetic moments at edges depends on whether the edge bonds are strong or weak . in the bond - alternating chain ,",
    "the magnetic structures behave almost independently even at very low temperatures , contrary to the case of the uniform chain . if we model the interaction of the magnetic structure by a effective spin model , the interaction @xmath71 is expected to be exponentially small with the system size , which is due to the gapful nature of the bond - alternating chain .",
    "we also investigated the force acting between the bond impurities and studied the distribution of impurities when impurities are allowed to move .",
    "it turned out that the force is attractive both between the impurity bonds in the uniform chain , and between the defects of alternation in the bond - alternating chain .",
