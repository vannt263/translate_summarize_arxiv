    "recently , there have been a great interest to study theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite on the low - dimensional bose gases . among the various interesting topics related to the trapped bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) ,",
    "the study of structure factors and coherence properties of quantum bose gas has attracted major interest .",
    "the dynamic structure factor plays an important role which helps us to understand the discrete modes due to the finite size system @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamic structure factor calculated from the local density approximation do not show up the discrete nature of the modes and this is valid under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "the dynamic structure factor can be analyzed through the behavior of the momentum transferred to a trapped bose gases by two - photon bragg pulse with long duration @xcite which reflects the underlying discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , coherence has importance for many applications , like matter wave interferometry , guided atomic beams and atom lasers .",
    "the realization of the quasi - one dimensional bose systems at mit @xcite raises the question of the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the discrete nature of the excitations implies that bec will not be destroyed immediately as interactions between bosons are turned on @xcite . in low dimensions ,",
    "long - wave length density and phase fluctuations lead to a new intermediate state between a condensate and non - condensate system .",
    "the system forms a _ quasi - condensate _ , in which the phase of the order parameter is only coherent over a finite distance less than the system size , whereas the phase is coherent over a distance of the order of the size of the system in a true condensate .",
    "quasi - condensate of a phase fluctuating becs have been the subject of theoretical studies @xcite , including the development of a improved many - body @xmath3-matrix theory valid in all dimensions and at low temperatures @xcite , and the extension of the bogoliubov theory to low - dimensional degenerate bose gases @xcite .",
    "also , the phase fluctuating nature of highly elongated bec was experimentally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in details on the properties of the effect of the low - energy modes , particularly , dynamic structure factor , and also the momentum transferred by a two - photon bragg pulse since there have not been any study in the literature on these properties .",
    "moreover , in the theoretical studies on degenerate bose gases have neglected the contribution from the density fluctuations and have concentrated only upto the quadratic phase fluctuations .",
    "the density fluctuations and higher order phase fluctuations are important to study coherence properties for a wide range of the system parameters . in this work ,",
    "we calculate one - body density matrix , phase correlation length and momentum distribution by taking care of the density fluctuations and fourth - order phase fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , using the phase - density representation of the bose order parameter , we write down an effective hydrodynamic hamiltonian and diagonalize it in terms of the normal modes of the density and phase fluctuations .",
    "first , we rederive the known low - energy modes at zero temperature .",
    "then we incorporate the temperature into theory through the temperature dependent chemical potential . in section iii , we calculate static and dynamic structure factors",
    ". we also present an analytic expression for the time - evolution of momentum transfer to the system due to the bragg pulse . in section iv",
    ", we consider the effect of the density fluctuations and the fourth - order term in the phase fluctuations and calculate the phase coherence function , the phase correlation length and momentum distribution .",
    "we also discuss the possibility to form a true condensate by changing the system parameters . in section",
    "v , we give a brief summary of our work .",
    "we consider atomic bose gases confined in a quasi - one dimensional harmonic trap as described in mit lab @xcite .",
