    "the production of strange particles in nuclear collisions is an exciting subject in nuclear physics ; e.g. strangeness enhancement is proposed as a signature for the formation of the quark qluon plasma in high energy nucleus - nucleus collision  @xcite .",
    "the production of strange particles in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies , furthermore , is also discussed as a way to study hot and dense nuclear matter  @xcite due to the weak @xmath12 final state interaction .    during the last years @xmath1 meson production from heavy - ion collisions at energies per nucleon below the free @xmath13 reaction threshold",
    "was intensively studied at gsi  @xcite , however , the interpretation of the experimental data is strongly model dependent because secondary production channels play a sensible role . among the secondary reactions relevant for strangeness production at low energies",
    "are @xmath5 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "as already discussed by koch and dover  @xcite the @xmath16 might play an important role for subthreshold particle production .",
    "the heavy - ion simulations from lang et al .",
    "@xcite , huang et al .",
    "@xcite , aichelin and ko  @xcite and li and ko  @xcite show that the gsi data might be reproduced when accounting for the kaon production from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions",
    ". however , the former conclusion strongly depends upon the elementary @xmath17 cross section employed and the ratios between @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 reaction channels .",
    "more recent calculations on strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , which are based on more reliable elementary cross sections  @xcite , indicate that the @xmath18 channels are dominant at low energies .",
    "note , that the strangeness production via secondary meson - meson , meson - baryon and baryon - baryon interactions is also important for ags energies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental information on subthreshold strangeness production in @xmath19 reactions is available from saturne  @xcite and celsius  @xcite and will be available at cosy  @xcite soon .",
    "the most important ingredients for the proton - nucleus and heavy - ion simulations are the elementary cross sections for strange particle production . from the experimental data we know the @xmath20 amplitude rather well whereas the @xmath21 cross section is not well determined , since before 1997 the available experimental data on the reaction were very scarce  @xcite .",
    "a sizeable step forward was achieved recently with the measurement of the @xmath22 cross section by the cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this reaction was studied very close to threshold and could clarify the validity of the old parameterizations on strangeness production from randrup and ko  @xcite and zwermann and schrmann  @xcite , which have peviously been used for @xmath23 and @xmath24 simulations .",
    "however , inspite of the experimental progress our understanding of the reaction mechanism is still poor .",
    "the predictions of li and ko  @xcite and sibirtsev  @xcite quite reasonably reproduce the data  @xcite based on the @xmath25-meson exchange mechanism , while the study of fldt and wilkin  @xcite and tsushima et al .",
    "@xcite indicate a dominance of @xmath26-meson exchange followed by the excitation of a @xmath27 baryonic resonance decaying to @xmath28 . in principle , by varying the model parameters both approaches can describe the experimental data .",
    "thus the most constructive analysis of the present status is to investigate the model uncertainties as well as the selfconsistency of the calculations .",
    "recently , the most detailed analysis in the resonance model for strangeness production was performed by sibirtsev , tsushima and thomas  @xcite . here",
    "the most crucial parameters entering the @xmath22 calculations are efficiently fixed by the @xmath29 reaction  @xcite which clarifies the uncertainties of the resonance approach  @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the role of the kaon exchange mechanism for strangeness production and investigate to what extent our results might be influenced by the model parameters .",
    "our study is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the theoretical status and the uncertainties of the model while in section 3 we formulate the one - meson exchange model . our results from the calculations with pion and kaon exchange diagrams are discussed in sections 4 and 5 , respectively . in section 6 ,",
    "furthermore , we analyze the near - threshold behavior of the total production cross section while a summary is presented in section 7 .",
    "the forces between baryons are traditionally considered as due to boson exchange .",
    "one of the models proposed to calculate the nucleon - nucleon scattering is the single pion exchange  @xcite .",
    "an application of the meson exchange to photoproduction was performed already in 1961 by sakurai  @xcite , while for inelastic processes it was first investigated by chew and low  @xcite .",
    "a first application of the boson exchange mechanism to the calculation of strangeness production in proton - proton collisions at the energy of 3  gev was performed in 1960 by ferrari  @xcite . here ,",
    "pion and kaon exchange graphs were considered and it was found that the contribution from the pion exchange to the @xmath22 reaction cross section is about twice less than that from kaon exchange . the relevant diagrams for kaon production from @xmath30 collisions are shown in figs .",
    "[ dia1],[dia2 ] .    within a similar approach , but neglecting the contribution from the kaon exchange diagram , yao  @xcite calculated the strangeness production in the reactions @xmath31 and @xmath32 at 2.9 gev and rather well reproduced the total cross section as well as momentum and angular distributions . in his calculations",
    "it was assumed that the cut - off parameter of the pion form factor is given by the squared nucleon mass while the energy dependence of the @xmath33 amplitude was neglected .",
    "lateron , wu and ko  @xcite calculated the energy dependence of the production cross section for the reaction @xmath22 . using only the one pion exchange they could reasonably well fit the available experimental data and thus pointed out a negligible contribution from the kaon exchange diagram .",
    "a more detailed calculation of the associated strangeness production in proton - proton collisions was performed by laget  @xcite . within the boson exchange model",
    "it was found that the pion exchange accounts only for about 20@xmath34 of the total @xmath35 cross section whereas the residual cross section is due to the kaon exchange mechanism .",
    "it was also shown that the dominant contribution to the cross section of the reaction @xmath36 stems from the one - pion exchange diagrams due to the small coupling constant @xmath370.8 .",
    "the most surprising results were obtained by deloff  @xcite within the pion and the kaon exchange model .",
    "he found that the experimental data can be reproduced by the pion and kaon exchange mechanism with the coupling constants @xmath38 which strongly contradicted the previous calculations as well as the present understanding of the @xmath39 interaction  @xcite .",
    "more recent calculations on @xmath40 reactions including proton , neutron and @xmath16-resonances in the entrance channel and accounting for both pion and kaon exchanges were performed by li and ko  @xcite using the coupling constants and cut - off parameters from ref .",
    "moreover , similar to laget  @xcite both the @xmath33 and @xmath41 amplitudes were taken off - shell .",
    "the latter assumption is the basic difference between our calculations and those from refs .",
    "@xcite . in our approach , to be described below , we will adopt on - shell amplitudes in the upper vertices in the diagrams presented in figs .",
    "[ dia1],[dia2 ] .",
    "calculations of the @xmath25-meson production in proton - proton collisions close to threshold within the one - pion exchange followed by @xmath27 resonance excitation were performed by fldt and wilkin  @xcite .",
    "actually the pion exchange diagrams from fig .",
    "[ dia2 ] can be reversed to the graph shown in fig .",
    "moreover , within this resonance model one has to account for all baryonic resonances @xmath42 coupling to @xmath43 as well as to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels .",
    "thus the resonance model allows to treat not only the pion exchange , but also the @xmath47 and @xmath48-meson exchanges simultaneously .",
    "since the @xmath27 is the lowest baryonic resonances , which can decay to the @xmath49 channel , its contribution is dominant at low collision energies . since @xmath27 is not coupled to the @xmath50 channel , one has to account for other baryonic resonances to calculate @xmath51 cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the next @xmath52 resonance coupled to the @xmath49 channel has a larger mass and can be excited in @xmath30 collisions at energies around 100  mev above the @xmath22 reaction threshold .",
    "note that the @xmath27 does not decay to the @xmath53 channel and for the @xmath51 reaction it is necessary to incorporate both the @xmath52 and @xmath54 resonances .",
    "since the @xmath27 strongly couples to the pion ( 60 - 80% ) and only slightly to the @xmath55-meson ( 3 - 10% ) , the motivation of fldt and wilkin  @xcite appeared quite reasonable .",
    "the actual question is the absolute value of their prediction for the @xmath22 cross section .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 branching ratios are known experimentally  @xcite and therefore the corresponding coupling constants can be reasonably fixed on resonance .",
    "note that by changing the couplings one can vary only the absolute magnitude of the @xmath22 cross section , but not its energy dependence .",
    "thus , in principle , keeping these constants as free parameters one can perfectly reproduce the experimental data near threshold  @xcite .",
    "however , these parameters can be varied only within a certain range in line with the particle properties  @xcite . a more consistent calculation within the resonance model and for",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath51 reactions was performed by tsushima , sibirtsev and thomas  @xcite . to avoid the uncertainties in the coupling constants and cut - off parameters the latter were taken from the analysis of the @xmath29 and @xmath59 reactions .",
    "moreover , their calculations were performed for a wide range of @xmath30 collision energies in order to reproduce the recent near - threshold experimental data  @xcite as well as the results available at high energies  @xcite .",
    "all available and relevant baryonic resonances as well as @xmath26 , @xmath55 and @xmath48-meson exchanges were properly included .",
    "however , it was found that the calculations within the resonance model  @xcite underestimate the @xmath22 cross section at low energy .",
    "let us now discuss the uncertainties of the calculations within the pion and kaon exchange model .",
    "obviously , the calculations with the boson exchange model following the prescription from figs.[dia1],[dia2 ] substantially depend on the accuracy of the @xmath18 and @xmath41 amplitudes entering the calculations .",
    "again , quite reliable studies for the @xmath18 reaction within the resonance model were done by tsushima , huang and faessler  @xcite who perfectly describe all channels of the @xmath18 reaction at low energies .",
    "the @xmath18 reaction was also investigated within the microscopic quark model by yan , huang and faessler  @xcite . moreover , the experimental data on strangeness production in pion induced reactions are well suited to perform simple parametrizations  @xcite of the @xmath18 cross sections and to adopt them for the @xmath60 calculations within the pion - exchange model",
    ".    on the other hand , the @xmath41 amplitude can not be well determined from the experimental data , since these are available for the @xmath61 channel only , which corresponds to the reaction @xmath62 .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath63 amplitude is not very accurate  @xcite , but this cross section is important for the kaon exchange model because it contributes to the following two - body amplitudes : @xmath64 a substantial progress in the calculation of the @xmath65 amplitude was achieved recently by the jlich group  @xcite in analyzing @xmath66 elastic cross sections . on the other hand , to calculate the contribution from the kaon exchange to the @xmath22 cross section , one needs the @xmath61 amplitude only .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as well as the corresponding cut - off parameters substantially influence the relative contribution from the pion and the kaon exchange mechanism .",
    "actually we consider the coupling constant @xmath67 as well as the cut - off parameter @xmath7 in the @xmath70 vertex to be fixed by the analysis in the bonn model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath68 and @xmath71 couplings are related to the mixing angle @xmath72 between the @xmath73 and @xmath4 contents of the nucleon as @xmath74 @xmath11 symmetry predicts @xmath75 and thus a ratio @xmath76 27/1 .",
    "note that when using the resonance prescription the coupling constant is related to the partial decay width of the resonance and thus the @xmath77 coupling defines the strangeness content @xmath78 of the nucleon .",
    "this clearly indicates the importance of the @xmath17 reactions for the understanding of the fundamental properties of the nucleon .    in table 1",
    "we summarize the results on @xmath79 obtained from the @xmath66 dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants from dalitz et al .",
    "@xcite were obtained by an analysis of the total set of experimental data on @xmath66 scattering .",
    "the result from the meson exchange calculation of laget  @xcite is close to the prediction from @xmath11 symmetry , while the ratio @xmath80 from deloff  @xcite is the smallest value among those obtained presently .",

    "@xmath90 underestimates the experimental data for inclusive kaon production substantially which demonstrates the importance of final channels with additional @xmath91-mesons .",
    "within the boson exchange model we have calculated the cross section for the reactions @xmath31 with a @xmath73 , @xmath50-hyperon and @xmath2 , @xmath1-meson .",
    "the contributions from the one - pion and kaon exchange were studied separately .",
