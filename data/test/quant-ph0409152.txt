    "we remark that while in the derivation of the first equality of ( [ coh3 ] ) the normal ordering is extensively used , the second equality , as well as ( [ coh5 ] ) , may be obtained by manipulating the functional integral representation of the green functions generating functional . although much simpler that the standard advanced field theoretical methods , our approach give essentially the same formulae , which are directly applicable to the time evolution operator or to the _ partition function integrand _ @xcite .",
    "this we consider as a strong argument in favour of the present method .",
    "in the effort to understand the meaning of perturbation expansions in quantum physics , both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory , it is important to know their large order behaviour . solving the problem for the coupling constant perturbation series one finds that the number of the feynman diagrams , contributing order by order to the perturbation series coefficients , grows factorially , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the factorial growth occurs because of the combinatorial reasons which ( at least qualitatively and for the large orders asymptotics ) explain why such a behaviour does not essentially depend on details of the model if one disregards the problem of",
    "_ _ renormalons__. enumeration of diagrams for more complicated models is echoed by that of their zero  dimensional analogues , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "taking all diagrams of a given order to have equal values shows that this is the number of graphs which determines the divergence of the ( renormalized ) perturbation series .",
    "being able to estimate these numbers order by order we may investigate a perturbation series , estimate its asymptotic character and investigate resummation methods .",
    "the idea is to search for generating functions of given sequences of ( combinatorial ) numbers , _",
    "i.e. , _ to look for functions which enumerate the same weighted objects as the initial formal series do .",
    "if found in analytic form such functions may be treated as generalized sums of formal , _ i.e. , _ divergent and so analytically meaningless , series .",
    "we shall call such an approach a `` combinatorial field theory '' emphasizing that the notion should be understood in a two senses .",
    "the first sense is to obtain a generating function for the perturbation series , using any of the standard methods .",
    "the second , or inverse sense , is to construct interaction which leads to a postulated set of combinatorial numbers  following the statement of reference @xcite that _ given a sequence of numbers @xmath93 , it is always possible to find a set of feynman rules that reproduce that sequence_.    the zero  dimensional analogue of ( [ coh3 ] ) taken for @xmath94 ( _ i.e. _ , the generating functional for the _ bubble _ feynman graphs in the field  theoretical jargon ) is a particular case of the right hand side of ( [ coh2 ] ) .",
    "so the latter formula may be considered as a recipe which counts the feynman  like graphs in a model for which the potential is @xmath95 and for which we deal with `` multilegged propagators '' of strenghts @xmath96 , @xcite , @xcite . using ( [ bell4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ bell4 - 2 ] ) we have for @xmath97 s related both to @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100})= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{x^n}{n!}{y}_n({[g]},u)\\,,\\ ] ] and for ( [ coh2 ] ) we get @xmath101\\bigl|1\\bigr>= z({l},{v},\\lambda)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n({l},{v } ) \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!}\\,,\\ ] ] using a notation @xmath102)\\cdot y_n([v])\\,.\\ ] ]    the standard example which illustrates how the counting formula works is the the zero  dimensional analogue of the anharmonic oscillator or @xmath103 model .",

    "_ i.e. _ , in @xmath110 . in ( [ feynman2 ] )",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath17 which counts derivatives and , in a graph representation , produces lines or `` propagators '' .",
    "we shall adopt this convention in what follows ; however , each approach may be translated into the other using ( [ coh5 ] ) .",
    "the series at the right hand side of ( [ feynman4 ] ) is divergent which poses the question as to its meaning .",
    "the answer is given if one notices that the same series is got when one calculates a formal power series expansion in @xmath97 for the integral @xmath111 the integral above does not define a function analytical for @xmath112 because it does not exist for @xmath113 .",
    "being well defined for @xmath114 it admits an analytic continuation to @xmath115 which is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the macdonald function , _",
    "i.e. _ , a bessel function of the imaginary argument .",
    "this allows to give a meaning to the series in ( [ feynman4 ] )  it is an asymptotic expansion of ( [ feynman6 ] ) for @xmath118 , @xmath115 .",
    "so the series under consideration may be treated as summable in a generalized sense ( nonuniquely , _",
    "modulo _ functions obeying zeroth asymptotic expansions ) to the properly defined function .",

    "namely , the number @xmath122 is obtained as the number of all , connected and disconnected , graphs with the same number @xmath49 of labelled lines .",
    "the feynman  like graphs representation is however different from the conventional one of field theory .",
    "for the first thing , we classify graphs using the number of lines , not vertices .",
    "this does not matter for the simplest examples having monomials in both exponentials , but for more complicated normally ordered expressions our method leads to an alternative description .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for details ; here we list only the rules of the graph construction and define those multiplicity factors which are necessary in order to understand pictorial illustrations of examples in the next section .",

    "basing our analysis on a simple product formula , we have applied these combinatorial methods to investigate some simple problems of field theory and many body quantum physics .",
    "the close connection between the normal  ordering problem of the operators appearing in the theory and the associated combinatorial algebra is evident .",
    "these combinatorial methods open the possibility of investigating solutions to a variety of field theoretical problems . differing from , and more simple than , the standard methods",
    ", this approach encourages us to believe that it may fruitfully be applied to more complex problems than those which we have treated for illustration in this article , and that it may well become a supplement to the standard methods of field theory , which are at present dominated by complex and functional analysis .",
    "we have benefited from the use of the eis @xcite in the course of this work .",
