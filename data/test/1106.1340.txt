    "recent investigations of quantum hall ( qh ) interferometers  @xcite give rise to several fundamental puzzles even in the integer qh regime . the major ones are the influence of the electron - electron interaction on the interference pattern  @xcite and the nature of the decoherence  @xcite .",
    "quantum hall interferometers are realized  @xcite by current - carrying edge states  @xcite ( es ) , arising at the intersections of the fermi level and filled landau levels at the sample edge .",
    "usually , a key part of the interferometer scheme is a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , which enables a connection between two identical counter - propagating edge states ( es )  @xcite . by using two qpc in a proper sequence , an electronic analog of mach - zehnder  @xcite or fabry - perot  @xcite interferometer can be realized .",
    "the interference pattern reflects the operation regime of quantum interferometer  @xcite . in the simplest case of the extreme aharonov - bohm ( ab ) regime",
    ", electron - electron interaction has no effect on the interference pattern .",
    "the interference period corresponds to the change of the flux @xmath0 through the interferometer loop area @xmath1 by one flux quantum @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is practically independent of the magnetic field @xmath3 . in the opposite extreme coulomb - dominated ( cd ) regime",
    ", @xmath4 depends also on the number of particles within the loop because of coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "the interference pattern reveals complicated structures in @xmath5 plane in between these two extreme regimes  @xcite .",
    "it was recently demonstrated  @xcite , that the extreme cd and mixed ab - cd regimes are realized in small ( about 2  @xmath6 m size ) devices  @xcite , while the extreme ab regime is realized for big ( 20  @xmath6 m ) qpc - based interferometers  @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms were proposed to explain coherence  @xcite in the qpc - based interferometers .",
    "the coherence length was found  @xcite to be inversely proportional to the temperature , which is compatible with theoretical predictions based on a dephasing arising from the thermal noise of the environment  @xcite .",
    "however , the complete theory is still missing for the dependence of the dephasing on magnetic field and imbalance  @xcite .",
    "visibility of the interference oscillations can be seriously suppressed even by low ( of the order of microvolts ) voltage imbalances in qpc  @xcite . by contrast , a clear visible interference was reported even at millivolt imbalances for the interferometers realized by two co - propagating es at a single sample edge  @xcite .",
    "the evident discrepancy of the results implies a substantially different operation principle for the interferometers realized by co - propagating es .    here ,",
    "we experimentally realize quantum hall mach - zehnder interferometer which operates far beyond the equilibrium . the operation of the interferometer is based on allowed intra - edge elastic transitions within the same landau sublevel in the regime of high imbalances between the co - propagating edge states .",
    "since the every edge state is definitely connected with the certain landau sublevel , the formation of the interference loop can be understood as a splitting and a further reconnection of a single edge state .",
    "we observe an aharonov - bohm type interference pattern even for low - size interferometers .",
    "this novel interference scheme demonstrates high visibility even at millivolt imbalances and survives in a wide temperature range .",
    "each sample has a macroscopic ( @xmath7 ) etched region inside .",
    "ohmic contacts are placed at the mesa edges , denoted by bars with numbers .",
    "a split - gate ( light yellow ) partially encircles the etched area , leaving uncovered narrow gate - gap region at the outer mesa edge .",
    "light green area indicates uncovered 2deg .",
    "the @xmath81 or 1.5  @xmath6 m width gate finger is placed at the center of the gate - gap , being connected to the main gate outside the mesa .",
    "the lithographic overlap with the mesa is equal to @xmath9 m .",
    "the gate finger separates two es ( thick lines ) in the gate - gap , so the inter - es transitions are only allowed in two interaction regions of widths @xmath10 m .",
    "arrows indicate an electron propagation direction within es .",
    "( b ) sem image of the gate finger region .",
    "two es ( green and yellow thick lines ) are sketched as a straight lines regardless roughness of the mesa edge . for measurements one of the inner contacts ( 3 or 4 )",
    "is grounded .",
    "current is applied to one of the outer contacts ( 1 or 2 ) , while the other outer contact is used to trace the outer es potential .",
    "[ sample ] ]    our samples are fabricated from a molecular beam epitaxially - grown gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "it contains a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) located 200  nm below the surface . the 2deg mobility at 4k is @xmath11@xmath12/vs and the carrier density is @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "a novel sample design realizes a quantum hall interferometer based on independently contacted co - propagating edge states , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "edge states arise at the sample edges as the intersections of the fermi level and filled landau sublevels  @xcite . at the bulk filling factor @xmath15",
    ", there are two co - propagating spin - split es along the ungated mesa edges .",
    "the main gate redirects the inner es , see fig  [ sample ] ( a ) , by depleting 2deg underneath to a lower filling factor @xmath16 .",
    "it allows an independent contacting of two co - propagating es in the gate - gap region at the outer mesa edge .",
    "the gate finger at the center of the gate - gap region divides the inter - es junction onto two ones .",
    "we study samples with two different gate finger widths @xmath81",
    "@xmath6 m or 1.5  @xmath6 m .    to study the transmittance of the device we ground one of the inner ohmic contacts ( 3 or 4 ) and apply a _ dc _ current to one of the outer contacts ( 1 or 2 ) .",
    "the other outer contact is used to trace the outer es potential .",
    "we check that the obtained interference pattern does not depend on the particular choice of the contact combination , which only affects the total resistance of the device .    at positive currents , an electron contribute to transport only if it is transferred from the inner es to the outer one in the gate - gap region .",
    "it can occur with some probability in the first es junction of width @xmath10 m or an electron can follow the inner es around the gate finger and be transferred in the second one , see fig .  [ sample ] . in a very naive picture",
    "these two transmission regions serves as two semi - transparent mirrors in optical mach - zehnder interferometer , while two paths around the gate finger define the interferometer arms .",
    "this naive picture does not concern sophisticated dependence of the inter - es transport on es imbalance at a single sample edge , see for a review ref .  .",
    "we discuss the interferometer operation in detail after the presenting of the experimental results .",
    "the phase difference @xmath17 between the interferometer arms is controlled by the flux @xmath4 through the gate finger area .",
    "@xmath4 can be affected  @xcite by varying either the magnetic field @xmath3 or the effective gate finger area @xmath1 . within the qh plateau ,",
    "@xmath1 is sensitive to the _ top _ gate voltage @xmath18 only because of varying the depletion width along the gate perimeter .",
    "by contrast to commonly used plunger gates , @xmath1 is increasing with further depleting the top gate .",
    "the measurements are performed in a dilution refrigerator with the minimal temperature of 30  mk .",
    "the interference pattern is independent of the cooling cycle .",
    "standard two - point magnetoresistance is used to determine the regions of @xmath3 which correspond to integer qh filling factors @xmath19 in the ungated area .",
    "we measure capacitance between the gate and 2deg as a function of the gate voltage @xmath18 at constant magnetic field to find @xmath18 regions of integer filling factors @xmath20 under the gate .",
    "at constant gate voltage @xmath21  v ( a ) or the gate voltage @xmath18 at several constant magnetic fields ( b ) within the @xmath16 qh state under the gate finger .",

[ oscill21 ] ]    to observe the interference effects in the transmittance of the device , we apply fixed dc current @xmath30 in the range of @xmath31  na across the gate - gap junction as described before .",
    "the potential of the outer contact @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "[ oscill21 ] in dependence on the magnetic field @xmath3 ( a ) or the gate voltage @xmath18 ( b ) .",
    "both @xmath33 are varied within the @xmath16 qh state under the gate finger . a monotonous increase in @xmath24",

    "[ oscill21 ] ( a ) .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ oscill21 ] ( b ) remain unchanged .",
    "the @xmath34 signal drops down at the edges of the @xmath16 qh plateau ( see also fig .",
    "[ temp ] ( a ) ) , because at finite @xmath35 under the gate some part of the current flows outside the gate - gap region .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath34 dependencies exhibit nearly equidistant ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ oscill21 ] ( a ) ) oscillations with periods @xmath22  mt and @xmath23  mv respectively .",
    "[ oscill21 ] ( b ) also shows the evolution of the oscillation picture with increasing the magnetic field .",
    "the position of every oscillation moves to higher @xmath18 with increasing the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "since the increase in @xmath18 lowers the depletion , it lowers @xmath1 , so this behavior is a fingerprint of the extreme ab interference regime  @xcite @xmath36bs@xmath37 .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated for a wide magnetic field range .    because of a simple relation @xmath38 in the extreme ab interferometer regime , @xmath39 reflects the whole active interferometer area @xmath1 , @xmath40 .",
    "high values of the oscillation numbers @xmath41 in the inset to fig .",
    "[ oscill21 ] ( a ) also support the invariance of the loop area @xmath1 while changing the flux @xmath4 on a quantum @xmath2 .",
    "the estimation @xmath42 is in a reasonable agreement with the gate finger dimensions , because the lithographic length @xmath9 m should be corrected by the a depletion length of roughly the 2deg depth ( @xmath43  nm ) at the mesa edge  @xcite .",
    "the sample with the bigger @xmath27 m and demonstrates oscillations with @xmath26  mt which corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the period @xmath39 reasonably scales with the gate finger width @xmath45 even in view of the obvious roughness of the etched mesa edge .",
    "the above described picture of the extreme ab interference regime is also confirmed by measurements at other integer filling factors .",
    "usually @xmath39 scales with filling factors for the small qpc - based interferometers  @xcite , which is a characteristic feature of the cd interference regime  @xcite . in the present investigation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath46  mt for @xmath47 and slightly higher @xmath48  mt for @xmath49 fillings . there are three es in the gate - gap junction at the bulk filling factor @xmath50 .",
    "because at @xmath16 there is one es under the gate finger , the interferometer geometry is formed by the same two outer spin - split es as in the @xmath29 case .",
    "for @xmath51 , @xmath1 is somewhat diminished because of two es under the gate finger , which is reflected in a higher period .",
    "by contrast to previous investigations  @xcite , the interference is certainly demonstrated at millivolt imbalances in figs .",
    "[ oscill21 ] . moreover , the interference oscillations appears only above some threshold imbalance value . above this value",
    ", they are nearly independent of the applied imbalance , see fig .",
    "[ temp ] ( b ) .",
    "the oscillations also remain practically unchanged with increasing the temperature in fig .  [ temp ]",
    "( a ) , while the @xmath16 qh plateau width , as determined by the signal drop , is highly sensitive to the temperature .",
    "the oscillations are visible even at @xmath52  k , where the plateau is very narrow and the level of the signal is diminished because of an admixture of the dissipative current under the gate finger , see fig .",
    "[ temp ] ( a ) .     for different temperatures @xmath53 .",
    "the oscillations amplitude is insensitive to the temperature , in contrast to the width of the @xmath16 qh plateau and the mean level of the signal .",
    "the signal drops down at the @xmath16 qh plateau edges .",
    "measurement current is @xmath25  na , magnetic field is @xmath54  t. ( b ) oscillations for different imbalances ( measurement currents ) at @xmath55  t , @xmath56  mk .",
    "the amplitude is practically independent of the imbalance .",
    "the mean value of the signal reflects the @xmath57 dependence ( the lowest curves are still shifted vertically in the figure to avoid overlap ) .",
    "thick lines indicate the positions of the oscillations , which differ in ( a ) and ( b ) because of different fields . [ temp ] ]",
    "as a result , ( i ) we undoubtedly observe the interference oscillations at millivolt imbalances in our device ; ( ii ) the visibility of the oscillations does not depend on the imbalance and temperature ; ( iii ) the interferometer operates in the extreme ab regime , i.e. electron - electron interaction has minor effect on the interference pattern .",

    "[ iv ] ( a ) for the filling factors @xmath29 . at low imbalances ,",

    "applied inter - es electrochemical potential imbalance modifies the potential jump between two es .",
    "it is slightly diminished for low positive imbalances , because of the polarity in our setup .",
    "the inter - es transport is still negligible because the charge equilibration length  @xcite @xmath65 m exceeds significantly the total gate - gap junction width 2@xmath66 m . on the other hand ,",
    "high positive inter - es imbalance @xmath67 seriously distorts the edge energy structure  @xcite .",
    "it flattens the potential jump between two es at some value @xmath68 , see fig .",
    "[ mz_diagram ] ( b ) , which is reflected by the resistance drop in the experimental @xmath57 curve . at higher imbalances",

    "we want to emphasize that despite the theory  @xcite was developed only for the equilibrium , the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ mz_diagram ] are qualitatively proven by the @xmath57 curves spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "for the samples without the gate finger , @xmath60 simply reflects the zeeman splitting at the edge , which is monotonically increasing with the magnetic field  @xcite .",

    "the effect appears as a vertical shift of the curve at @xmath69 .",
    "for these two curves the shift is _ negative _ for the positive increase of the magnetic field , which is just opposite to the monotonous zeeman increase of @xmath60 .",
    "[ iv ] ( b ) is another representation of the interference independence of the applied imbalance in fig .",

    "[ mz_diagram ] , ( c ) , illustrates the energy diagrams for different positions within the gate - gap junction in fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "if we consider the inter - es transport to both sides of the gate finger , two major possibilities are allowed for an electron : ( i ) it can be directly transferred between the ground states in two es , which is accompanied by the energy loss and a spin flip , i.e. by the coherence loss ; ( ii ) at @xmath69 an electron can be elastically transferred within the same energy sublevel , see fig .",
    "[ mz_diagram ] ( c ) , with afterward relaxation to the ground state in the outer es .",
    "the latter possibility preserves the coherence for the time scale smaller than the relaxation time .",
    "thus , if the gate finger width @xmath45 is smaller than the relaxation length , an electron can cross the gate finger region by two paths , see fig .",
    "[ mz_diagram ] ( c ) : it encircles the finger gate along the inner es or propagates along the outer mesa edge being in the excited state here ( bottom diagram ) .",

    "the proposed interferometer operation scheme is supported by the experimental facts .",
    "we observe the interference oscillations only in the regime of allowed elastic transitions @xmath69 , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ iv ] ( b ) . in this regime ,",
    "an electron is at the same energy for both interferometer arms .",
    "this energy is independent of the exact value of the inter - es imbalance , which only slightly affects the position of the outer arm .",
    "the drift velocity for every arm is determined by the energy level slope , which is also insensitive to the bias applied _ between _ two compressible strips , see fig .",
    "[ mz_diagram ] ( c ) .",
    "thus , the inter - es imbalance can only have a minor effect on the oscillations , as we observe in the experiment , see fig .",

    "the relaxation mechanism at high imbalances may be different .",

    "<S> we experimentally realize quantum hall mach - zehnder interferometer which operates far beyond the equilibrium . the operation of the interferometer is based on allowed intra - edge elastic transitions within the same landau sublevel in the regime of high imbalances between the co - propagating edge states . </S>",
    "<S> since the every edge state is definitely connected with the certain landau sublevel , the formation of the interference loop can be understood as a splitting and a further reconnection of a single edge state . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an aharonov - bohm type interference pattern even for low - size interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> this novel interference scheme demonstrates high visibility even at millivolt imbalances and survives in a wide temperature range . </S>"
