    "the chemical evolutionary histories of spiral galaxies provide considerable insight into many of the important processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for example , we can study star formation laws ( sfls ; e.g.  wyse & silk 1989 ; phillipps & edmunds 1991 ) , the interactions between newly - formed stars and the interstellar medium ( e.g.  dekel & silk 1986 ; maclow & ferrera 1999 ) , the importance and effects of gas flows ( e.g.  lacey & fall 1985 ; edmunds 1990 ; edmunds & greenhow 1995 ) and the infall that must accompany disc formation ( e.g.  tinsley & larson 1978 ; lacey & fall 1983 ; steinmetz & mller 1994 ) .",
    "the main challenge is obtaining _ unambiguous _ insight into particular physical processes .",
    "some of the ambiguity can be circumvented by studying both the ages and the metallicities of galaxies : in this paper we use the ages and metallicities of a sample of face - on spiral galaxies to constrain which processes are the most important in affecting their observational properties .    despite these difficulties , considerable progress has been made in understanding some important aspects of galaxy formation and evolution . a local density dependence in the sfl is strongly favoured ,",
    "although other factors may affect the star formation rate ( sfr ) over galactic scales ( e.g.  schmidt 1959 ; dopita 1985 ; kennicutt 1989 ; wyse & silk 1989 ; dopita & ryder 1994 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "infall may be important in determining the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g.  tinsley 1980 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "other processes are more controversial : e.g.metal-enriched outflows ( e.g. maclow & ferrera 1999 ) or radial gas flows ( e.g.  edmunds & greenhow 1995 ; lacey & fall 1985 )",
    ".    however , recent observational advances , coupled with the development of multiple metallicity stellar population synthesis codes has allowed comparison of galaxy evolution models with both the gas metallicities and colours of spiral galaxies ( contardo , steinmetz & fritze - von alvensleben 1998 ; jimenez et al .  1998 ; boissier & prantzos 2000 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "the colours of spiral galaxies depend on both their ages and metallicities , therefore study of their colours offers fresh insight into galaxy formation and evolution , although inevitably degeneracies remain .    in bell & de jong ( 2000 ; bdj hereafter ) , we analysed the optical  near - infrared ( near - ir ) colours of a sample of 121 low - inclination spiral galaxies in conjunction with up - to - date stellar population synthesis models to explore trends in age and metallicity with galaxy parameters , such as magnitude or surface brightness .",
    "in particular , we found that there are significant trends between the age and @xmath0 band surface brightness of a galaxy , and between the metallicity and both the @xmath0 band magnitude and surface brightness of a galaxy . in that paper , we argued that these correlations could be the result of a surface density - dependent sfl , coupled with galaxy mass - dependent chemically - enriched gas outflows .    in this paper , we investigate these ideas in more detail .",
    "we use a family of simple models to explore the effects of infall , outflows , age differences and sfls on the colour - based ages and metallicities of spiral galaxies .",
    "our aim is not to construct a self - consistent , realistic model of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this work is intended to guide future , more detailed explorations of the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of spiral galaxies : this simple modelling isolates which physical processes affect which observables , to allow more realistic models to concentrate on formulating self - consistent prescriptions for the most important physical phenomena .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ c4model ]",
    ", we outline the data and its main limitations .",
    "we describe the chemical evolution model , the basic assumptions and equations and outline how we translate the model output into observables which we can readily compare with the data . in section [ c4evo ] , we describe the properties of the closed box model . in section [ c4inf ]",
    "we explore the effects of infall , outflow and systematic trends in galaxy formation epoch . in section [ c4sfl ] , we investigate the effects of changing the sfl on our results . in section [ c4disc ]",
    "we discuss the results further , checking the plausibility of these models with other observational constraints .",
    "there , we also compare our models to a comparable , but more detailed model by boissier & prantzos .",
    "finally , in section [ c4conc ] , we summarise our results .",
    "for this paper , we use the sample of 121 low - inclination spiral galaxies from bdj .",
    "the sample is described in more detail in bdj and in the sample s source papers @xcite .",
    "the sample galaxies were chosen to have radially - resolved surface brightnesses in at least one near - ir and two optical passbands .",
    "the sample galaxies have a wide range of surface brightnesses , magnitudes , scale lengths and gas fractions , but are not complete in any statistical sense ( at least as a unit ) .    in bdj",
    ", we used a combination of at least one near - ir and two optical passbands to split ( to some degree ) the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "we fit simplified sfhs to the optical  near - ir colours using a maximum likelihood technique to derive crude age ( reflecting the amount of recent to past star formation ; c.f . a birthrate parameter ) and metallicity estimates .",
    "these estimates are not accurate in an absolute sense : they are subject to uncertainties from a number of sources including model uncertainties , the effects of small bursts of star formation , the assumption of a single epoch of galaxy formation 12 gyr ago and dust , to name a few . however , we argue that the estimates are robust in a relative sense : these uncertainties compromise the absolute ages and metallicities but leave the relative ranking of galaxies by age or metallicity relatively unaffected .    the ages and metallicities of one scale length wide annuli in our sample galaxies",
    "were estimated using the above method .",
    "we also constructed estimates of the age and metallicity at one disc half - light radius and their gradients per @xmath0 band scale length using a weighted linear fit to the ages and metallicities as a function of radius .",
    "more description of the method , its caveats and limitations can be found in bdj .      in order to make the investigation of the trends in age and metallicity a tractable problem , we adopt highly simplified _ ad hoc _ prescriptions describing star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "these simple approximations allow us to investigate which effects play an important role in e.g.  imprinting mass dependence in the sfh .",
    "we _ do not _ include gas flows in these models : assuming that the final total baryonic mass distribution is no different from a model without gas flows , the primary difference between models with and without gas flows will be the metallicity gradients ( e.g.  lacey & fall 1985 ; edmunds 1990 ; edmunds & greenhow 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the metallicity gradients are not iron - clad constraints on the models ( in any case , the metallicity gradients are relatively unaffected by many of the changes explored in this paper , so the metallicity gradients were not particularly strong model constraints anyway ) .    for consistency with our age and metallicity estimation procedure , we assume that our model galaxy forms 12 gyr ago as an exponential disc of gas with surface density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the initial surface density of gas in m@xmath3pc@xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the radius in units of the scale length of the gas ( denoted by @xmath6 ) . for the infall case ( see section [ c4infall ] ) , @xmath7 initially , and the gas mass is gradually built up over time assuming an exponentially declining infall rate with @xmath8-folding time @xmath9 . for the case",
    "in which we allow the galaxy formation epoch to vary as a function of its mass ( see section [ c4agediff ] ) , we change the galaxy formation epoch from 12 gyr to between 4 and 12 gyr , depending on galaxy mass .",
    "the gas forms stars according to a prescribed sfl : in much of this paper we adopt a schmidt ( 1959 ) sfl in terms of the gas surface density @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sfr in m@xmath3pc@xmath4gyr@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the efficiency of star formation at a gas surface density of 1 m@xmath3pc@xmath4 and @xmath15 is the exponent specifying how sensitively the sfr depends on gas surface density .",
    "this star formation produces heavy elements ; here we adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation ( ira ; e.g.  tinsley 1980 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "a fraction @xmath16 of the mass of newly formed stars is instantaneously returned to the gas .",
    "we adopt a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 m@xmath17 and 125 m@xmath17 respectively to describe the chemical and photometric evolution of our stellar populations : for this imf the returned fraction @xmath18 .",
    "this gas is returned along with a mass @xmath19 of heavy elements , where @xmath20 is the true yield , and is defined as the mass of freshly produced heavy elements per unit mass locked up in long - lived stars .",
    "the true yield @xmath20 is taken to be 0.02 ( solar metallicity ) hereafter unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "note that , for simplicity , we assume a metallicity - independent yield .",
    "note that our use of the ira should not lead to significant inaccuracies , as the metallicity of spiral galaxies is typically measured via their oxygen content : for oxygen , the ira is a fairly accurate approximation as it is produced primarily by type ii supernovae ( c.f .",
    "pagel 1998 ; although this assumption breaks down at late stages of galactic evolution near gas exhaustion ; portinari & chiosi 1999 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "once the ira is adopted , the following three equations specify the evolution of the galaxy completely : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the surface density of the stars in m@xmath3pc@xmath4 , @xmath23 is the gas surface density infall rate ( with an initial metallicity @xmath24 ; we assume @xmath25 hereafter ) in m@xmath3pc@xmath4gyr@xmath13 , @xmath26 is the surface density of gas ejected in outflows ( with metallicity @xmath27 ) in m@xmath3pc@xmath4gyr@xmath13 and @xmath28 is the gas metallicity ( tinsley 1980 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "we follow the evolution of the galaxy using a numerical scheme with a 20 myr timestep .",
    "we split our model galaxies into 20 radial zones between @xmath29 and @xmath30 gas disc scale lengths , to allow study of both global and radial trends in age and metallicity . while some of the cases we study here have analytical solutions , our use of a numerical scheme allows us to use more complex sfls and e.g.  infall or outflow histories .    in order to properly compare the models with the data",
    ", we use the colour - based maximum - likelihood technique from bdj to determine the ages and metallicities of our model galaxies . in order to use this technique",
    ", we must have a set of optical and near - ir colours for our model galaxies .",
    "therefore , in each zone at each timestep , we use the _ total _ mass of newly - formed stars ( both short- and long - lived ) to compute the contribution of those stars to the total flux at the present day in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath16 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath0 bands using interpolations between the multi - metallicity gissel98 models of bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) .",
    "we then use these local colours as input to the maximum - likelihood age and metallicity estimator developed for and presented in bdj . in this way ,",
    "_ we obtain model ages and metallicities determined in exactly the same way as the observations we compare with_. this can be quite important : especially so for older stellar populations .",
    "mass - weighted average ages of older stellar populations can differ considerably from the luminosity - weighted ages derived using the colour - based technique because of only relatively modest amounts of recent star formation .",
    "using these local age and metallicity estimates , we construct estimates of the global age and metallicity gradients and intercepts ( at the @xmath0 band disc half - light radius ) , using an unweighted least - squares fit ( c.f .",
    "@xmath0 band disc central surface brightnesses and scale lengths are determined by fitting the first 3 ( gas ) disc scale lengths of the surface brightness profile .",
    "global gas fractions are determined by direct summation of the model gas and stellar masses .",
    "the sample galaxies from bdj cover a broad range of magnitudes and surface brightnesses .",
    "therefore , to provide a fair comparison , the model galaxies must cover a similarly broad range of magnitudes and surface brightnesses .",
    "we adopt an empirical approach : we run a grid of 357 models with total ( baryonic and dark ) masses between @xmath37 m@xmath3 and @xmath38 m@xmath3 ( we assume a baryon fraction of 0.05 hereafter ) , and central baryonic surface densities between @xmath39 m@xmath3pc@xmath4 and @xmath40 m@xmath3pc@xmath4 .",
    "the step size is 0.25 dex .",
    "this range is sufficient to cover the full observed range of parameter space probed in bdj , assuming that the baryonic content of a galaxy turns entirely into solar - type stars .",
    "however , this situation is complicated by the ( broad ) correlation between surface brightness and magnitude ( c.f .  fig .  12 from bdj , or the grey dots in panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : c4phys ] ) .",
    "because of this correlation between surface brightness and magnitude , any correlation between e.g.   age and surface brightness will automatically translate into a correlation between age and magnitude .",
    "however , our model grid does not incorporate this correlation .",
    "therefore , to provide a fair comparison with the data , we select galaxies from the model grid that fall within the region inhabited by the sample galaxies in the @xmath0 band surface brightness  absolute magnitude plane ( fig .   [ fig : c4phys ] ) using the following criteria : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath0 band disc central surface brightness and @xmath43 is the @xmath0 band absolute magnitude of the galaxy . in this way",
    ", we can empirically select galaxies with a range of physical parameters consistent with those taken from bdj .",
    "this approach ensures that the galaxies we produce automatically roughly satisfy the selection criteria of bdj s sample .",
    "we make no attempt to derive the allowed range of surface brightnesses and scale lengths on the basis of the angular momentum of infalling gas ( e.g.dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "note that galaxies with different sets of surface densities and masses may be chosen , depending on the model details ( especially on the efficiency with which stars are turned into gas ) .",
    "we show an example of the selection box in panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : c4phys ] for the fiducial closed box model discussed in the next section .",
    "we show the @xmath0 band central surface brightness against the @xmath0 band absolute magnitude of the data ( in grey ) and the fiducial model ( in black ) .",
    "the model points show clearly the selection criteria that are applied on the model central surface brightnesses and magnitudes : these selection limits are applied to preserve the broad correlation between surface brightness and magnitude in the dataset , and to make sure we do not compare the data with models of galaxies that are drastically different from those in the data .",
    "panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig : c4phys ] shows the @xmath0 band central surface brightness against gas fraction relation for the same fiducial model .",
    "all of the models presented in this paper are constrained to reproduce this correlation ( although , in the case of e.g.   infall models , there is some scatter in this correlation ) .",
    "now we use this model grid to investigate trends in age and metallicity with local and global structural parameters in sections [ c4evo ] through [ c4sfl ] , where we vary the galaxy evolution and sfl prescriptions .",
    "a summary of the models presented in the following sections is given in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "the age , stellar metallicity and gas metallicity gradients are also given for these models in table [ tab : grads ] : note that there may be some slight mismatch in the properties of the observed and model galaxies ( e.g.  in panel a of fig.[fig : c4phys ] the model galaxies are regularly distributed in a rectangle , whereas the observed galaxies are clustered primarily towards the centre with a fairly significant contingent of galaxies with more extreme properties ) which may affect the comparison of the average model and observed gradients slightly .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     model gradients are averages over all selected galaxies ( see the selection criteria in fig .  [",
    "fig : c4phys ] and section [ subsec : c4det ] ) and the observed gradients are averages over the observational sample of bdj ( for age and stellar metallicity gradients ) and the sample of garnett et al .",
    "1997 for the gas metallicity gradients .",
    "we have not yet considered changes in the sfl : as we found that our results were quite sensitively affected by the sfl in the schmidt law model , it is worth investigating if some of the shortcomings of the fiducial model can be alleviated by the use of an alternative sfl .",
    "one possible modification to the star formation law is the imposition of a cutoff critical density @xmath44 below which star formation can not occur .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) found that the radially - averaged star formation rate ( sfr ) in a sample of 15 well - studied spiral galaxies was well - described by a critical density model .",
    "one physically motivated choice for that critical density is the maximum stable surface density of a thin isothermal gas disc , given by ( toomre 1964 ; kennicutt 1989 ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimensionless constant of order unity , @xmath47 is the velocity dispersion of the gas ( which we take , as kennicutt did , to be a constant @xmath48 kms@xmath13 for all galaxies ) and @xmath49 is the epicyclic frequency ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "kennicutt found that @xmath50 was a good fit to his data : stars typically did not form in regions where the density was lower than the critical density , and formed according to a schmidt law with index @xmath51 above the critical density threshold .    in order to estimate @xmath44 for our model galaxies",
    ", we must assume a rotation curve : for simplicity , we adopt an adaptation of the mass - dependent ` universal rotation curve ' from persic & salucci ( 1991 ) ( where we adopt a baryonic mass of @xmath52 for a @xmath53 galaxy with @xmath32 band absolute magnitude of @xmath54 assuming @xmath55 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ) .",
    "we use this rotation curve to determine the critical density in our model galaxies : we allow stars to form according to a schmidt law with @xmath56 and @xmath57 in gas denser than the critical density and do not allow stars to form at densities lower than the critical density .",
    "_ we do not use a critical density threshold in the central half scale length of the galaxy _ : apart from the undoubted influence of bars and bulges in the central regions of galaxies ( which we do not include in this model ) , the universal rotation curve is undefined in the inner regions of a galaxy , and the critical density becomes very large in the innermost regions of spiral galaxies due to strong differential rotation .",
    "thus , the behaviour of this star formation law at small radii is ill - constrained in this model : we , therefore , neglect the existence of a critical density at small radii and form stars according to a schmidt law .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : c4k89i ] we show the ages and metallicities for a model with a critical density for star formation in which we adopt infall ( see section [ c4infall ] ) .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : c4inf ] ( and inspection of table [ tab : grads ] ) shows that the imposition of a critical density does little to affect the colour - based ages or metallicities of spiral galaxies .",
    "only regions with relatively low gas densities are affected significantly : regions near the centre of galaxies where the gas is depleted by star formation may be affected ( although note that we do not impose the critical density within the central half scale length of our model galaxies ) , and the outermost regions where infall only recently brought the gas density above the critical density . in these outer regions",
    "the ages can be somewhat younger than those of the infall model without a critical density ( compare the colour - based ages of those regions with the lowest @xmath0 band surface brightnesses in panel a of figs .",
    "[ fig : c4k89i ] and [ fig : c4inf ] ) .    to summarise : the critical density threshold proposed by kennicutt ( 1989 ) does little to affect the global correlations between sfh and physical parameters predicted by models with a schmidt sfl .",
    "this is not to say that the existence of a critical density threshold has no effects at all : it is merely to state that the existence of a critical density threshold for star formation mainly affects the spatial distribution of present day star formation and does little to affect the star formation or chemical enrichment histories as probed by our colour - based technique .",
    "an alternative sfl was proposed by kennicutt ( 1998 ; ke98 hereafter ) based on his analysis of the global sfrs of a large sample of spiral and starburst galaxies .",
    "the sfr in this case scales with the ratio of the gas density to the local dynamical timescale : @xmath58 where @xmath59 gyr is the dynamical timescale , here defined as the time taken to orbit the galaxy at a distance @xmath16 . in this picture ,",
    "the sfr is related to both the gas supply and the timescale in which the gas can be brought together . as we did for the critical density model , we use the mass - dependent universal rotation curve of persic & salucci ( 1991 ) to estimate the dynamical time as a function of radius in our model galaxies .",
    "this sfl is similar in many ways to the radially - dependent sfls proposed by wyse & silk ( 1989 ) and allows us to explore how explicit radial dependence in the sfl affects how we interpret the trends in sfh with galaxy parameters presented in bdj .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : c4k98 ] we show the ages and metallicities given by the dynamical time model ( model d ) overplotted on the data from bdj .",
    "the dynamical time dependence does three main things : it introduces significant ( but reasonable ) scatter in the local ages and metallicities , it produces anticorrelations between age / metallicity and magnitude , and it produces steeper age and gas metallicity gradients .",
    "the production of relatively steep age and metallicity gradients is a success of this type of model .",
    "steep age gradients are expected from this model : in the limit of a flat rotation curve the ke98 sfl depends linearly on gas density , and the star formation efficiency varies as @xmath60 , leading to larger star formation timescales at larger radii .",
    "however , the observed _ trend _ in age gradient with surface brightness is not reproduced by the dynamical time model ( or , indeed , the infall model ) : in both the dynamical time and infall model the age gradients are steeper for higher surface brightness galaxies , which is the opposite of the observed trend ( fig .  [",
    "fig : c4sc ] ) .",
    "another more serious shortcoming of this model is the production of a ` backwards ' age  magnitude and metallicity  magnitude correlation .",
    "this is at first sight counter - intuitive : brighter galaxies have larger rotation velocities , which would increase the sfr at a given gas mass and physical radius .",
    "however , brighter galaxies are also typically larger , therefore there is little change in the average ratio of radius to velocity , that is , there is little change in the typical dynamical time as a function of magnitude .",
    "there is obviously a scatter in these properties , leading to a scatter in sfhs .",
    "the ` backwards ' age / metallicity  magnitude correlation is generated by the correlation between magnitude and surface brightness : small galaxies have older stellar populations in this model , and the smallest galaxies are also the faintest galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : c4phys ] ) .",
    "to summarise : the dynamical time model , due to its explicitly radius - dependent sfr , generates steeper age and metallicity gradients , compared to the fiducial closed box model .",
    "however , the dynamical time , on average , does not significantly depend on magnitude .",
    "coupled with the surface brightness ",
    "magnitude correlation , this implies that the faintest galaxies appear , on average , older than the brightest galaxies , which is clearly at odds with the observations .",
    "therefore a dynamical time dependence , alone , is not favoured by our dataset .",
    "in contrast to the previous sections , where we tuned the models to improve the match with the observational data , in this section we discuss three ` blind ' applications of the models to literature data : the models were not tuned to fit these observations ( solar cylinder data , global sfrs and gas metallicities ) , and they represent a powerful test of the model s validity . we also present a comparison of our models and the model of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) .",
    "many chemical evolution models focus ( sometimes almost exclusively ) on the milky way ( e.g.  wyse & silk 1989 ; steinmetz & mller 1994 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; portinari & chiosi 1999 ) : only after the models have been normalised to the milky way are the models extended to external galaxies , if at all ( e.g.  wyse & silk 1989 ; boissier & prantzos 2000 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "we have approached the problem from the other direction : we use the trends in galaxy properties with e.g.  surface brightness or magnitude to learn what processes might be at play in determining the star formation and chemical evolution histories of galaxies . nonetheless , it is interesting to check our models against observations of the ages and metallicities of stars in the solar cylinder , to provide a consistency check for our models .    in order to compare our models with the solar cylinder age and metallicity distributions ,",
    "it is necessary to choose one model galaxy as a ` milky way ' .",
    "we choose to adopt a galaxy with a magnitude of around @xmath61 and a @xmath0 band disc scale length of around 2.5 kpc in the closed box model ( this model galaxy has total mass of @xmath62 m@xmath3 and a baryonic central surface density of 1000 m@xmath3pc@xmath4 ) . in fig .",

    "2000a ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] , we see that the models have some difficulties in reproducing the properties of the solar cylinder .",
    "panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] clearly demonstrates that both our closed box and infall models have a significant g dwarf problem .",
    "this was expected : infall models require large amounts of late infall to solve the g dwarf problem ( e.g.  pagel 1998 ) .",
    "possible solutions of this problem include pre - enrichment of the infalling gas from bulge and/or population iii stars , more late infall , or some mixing of metals produced in outflows with the infalling gas .",
    "these additions are more complex processes that clearly need to be added to fine - tune the models . however , since any of the models could be tuned ( in a few ways ) to solve the galactic g dwarf problem , this problem does not in itself help us choose between models , and so these processes are not considered here for simplicity . the model age ",
    "metallicity relations are also not a perfect match to the data : our model age ",
    "metallicity relations are offset to lower metallicities , and show a steeper slope than the observed age  metallicity relation . while some of the slope mismatch may be due to the effects of observational errors ( rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2000a ) , the mismatches in the age  metallicity relation are related to the g dwarf problem : the model metallicity is always lower than the observations , especially so at early times .",
    "the milky way analogue model gas metallicity gradient is @xmath64 dexkpc@xmath13 , which is broadly consistent with observational estimates of between @xmath65 and @xmath66 dexkpc@xmath13 ( e.g.  vilchez & esteban 1996 ; smartt & rolleston 1997 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the models are a reasonable match to the observed ages and metallicities of solar cylinder stars , modulo a g dwarf problem , and that our approach of normalising the models on external galaxies has not seriously compromised the comparison with the milky way s properties .",
    "another important test is the comparison of the sfls that we used in these models against observed sfrs . here",

    "we can see that both models provide a fair match to the slope of ke98 s observations , and encompass the range of sfrs and gas densities typical of spiral galaxies .",

    "a possible source of the zero - point offset is the efficiency of the sfl @xmath14 : our model efficiencies are somewhat lower than e.g.  those efficiencies used by boissier & prantzos ( 1999,2000 ) .",
    "( somewhat higher star formation efficiencies would be required to match the observations if we assumed younger galaxy ages or postulated large amounts of late gas infall as boissier & prantzos assume . )",
    "a higher efficiency raises the sfr at a given gas density , providing a better match to the observations .",
    "however , there are other possibilities : it is possible that there are aperture mismatches or discrepancies between the observational and model sfr calibrations ( e.g.  in the conversion of the flux to sfr ) .",
    "earlier , we compared the models to the colour - based stellar ages and metallicities of the sample of galaxies from bdj .",
    "however , those ages and metallicities are subject to systematic errors from e.g.  model uncertainties and dust reddening . for this reason , it is important to check the models against the _ gas metallicities _ derived from region spectroscopy of spiral galaxies : these metallicities are subject to a completely independent set of uncertainties , and as such offer a chance to check our models .",
    "we have chosen to compare our model gas metallicities with data from garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasmet ] , where we show the surface density  local gas metallicity correlation for m33 and ngc 2403 from their fig .",
    "12 . data from garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are denoted by grey dots and the fiducial model output is shown as black circles .",
    "the model metallicity ",
    "surface density correlation has the right slope but an offset zero point .",
    "that the closed box fiducial model reproduces the right slope of the metallicity ",
    "surface density correlation disagrees with the conclusions of phillipps & edmunds ( 1991 ) , who concluded that observed metallicity gradients exceed those achievable with a schmidt sfl and closed box chemical evolution .",
    "however , inspection of their figs .",
    "1 and 2 suggests a good agreement between their simple schmidt law model and the observations , indicating that they may have overestimated the size of the observational trend between metallicity and surface density when compared to the schmidt law model .    the offset zero point is a well - known problem :",
    "when simple models are used to infer a yield from observations of the oxygen abundances of spiral galaxies , the yield is estimated to be around 1/3 solar ( e.g.  garnett et al .",
    "1997 ; pagel 1998 )",
    ". however , we require a yield of around or somewhat above solar to match the observations : this discrepancy amounts to an offset of around 0.5 dex , which is of the order of the offset between the average metallicity of the models and the observations .",
    "this discrepancy between the yield estimates indicates a mismatch between the colour - based and gas metallicities , although it is as yet uncertain whether this is a deficiency in the calibration of the colour - based metallicities , gas metallicities , or even both .",
    "however , uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratios used to derive the surface densities will propagate into this comparison .",
    "in addition , m33 and ngc 2403 are relatively faint ( m@xmath68 ) , and because of the metallicity  magnitude correlation they are expected to have a somewhat lower metallicity than that of the fiducial model .",
    "we do not show the comparison with their global gas metallicities here : the results are consistent with the overall yield offset between the gas and stellar metallicities outlined above and , again , the well - known gas metallicity  magnitude correlation ( e.g.  skillman et al .",
    "1989 ; garnett et al .  1997 ) can only be adequately reproduced by the outflow or formation epoch model ( as we found for the stellar metallicity ",
    "magnitude correlation ) .",
    "the average gas metallicity gradients of the model galaxies are presented in table [ tab : grads ] : the gas metallicity gradient per disc scale length of most models ( with the exception of the dynamical time model ) is within 10 per cent of the observational average , indicating that gas metallicity gradients have relatively little power to discriminate between the models .",
    "recently , boissier & prantzos discussed the properties of a specific , comprehensive disc galaxy spectro - photometric chemical evolution model in a trio of papers ( boissier & prantzos 1999,2000 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "they constructed a specific spectro - photometric chemical evolution model that reproduced many observational constraints , and explored why these observational constraints were reproduced by their model .",
    "we have taken a complementary approach , where we have explored a wide range of physical processes to understand the effects of each process on the ages and metallicities of spiral galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we compare the results of our modelling and theirs with a two - fold aim : to check that our studies give consistent results , and to gain some insight into how robust the conclusions of boissier & prantzos are likely to be if any of the modelling details were changed .",
    "their model used a combined schmidt and dynamical time sfl : @xmath69 , including surface density and mass - dependent infall , but , like our models , they did not include gas flows .",
    "they used a more sophisticated approach in dealing with the chemical evolution than adopted in this work ( they did not use the ira , but treated the full chemical evolution of the galaxy explicitly ) .",
    "they used halo circular velocities and spin parameters to parameterise their models but did not use the information about halo formation to fully specify the ages and infall histories of the discs they constructed ( c.f .",
    "dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "instead , they assumed a constant galaxy formation epoch of 13.5 gyr and tuned the surface density and mass dependence in the infall history to provide as good a match to the observations as possible .    here , we focus on two issues : the origin of age and metallicity gradients in spirals , and the nature and origin of the mass  metallicity correlation",
    ".    one of the main conclusions of prantzos & boissier ( 2000 ) is that they required radial variation in both the infall timescale and the sfl to produce colour and metallicity gradients that were large enough to agree with the observations .",
    "however , we found earlier that explicit radial dependence of _ both _ the sfl and infall history is not required to reproduce stellar and gas metallicity gradients , and that radial dependence in either one can produce a sufficient effect .",
    "another of the significant successes of the model from boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) is the reproduction of the metallicity  magnitude correlation .",
    "however , at first sight , this is somewhat of a puzzle as they do not include mass - dependent outflows or formation epoch differences in their model : their metallicity  magnitude correlation is reproduced entirely by a mass - dependent infall timescale .",
    "this puzzle is resolved by inspection of fig .",
    "3 of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) : it shows that at surface densities typical of spiral discs , the infall prescription that they adopt _ increases _ with time for galaxies with halo circular velocities @xmath70 kms@xmath13 .",
    "this increasing infall rate mimics a variation in formation epoch .",
    "therefore , we must modify our earlier conclusions : the infall history at early and intermediate times modifies primarily the colour - based ages of spirals ; however , large amounts of late infall affects both the colour - based ages and metallicities of spirals .",
    "furthermore , if the amount of late gas infall depends on galaxy mass , then a metallicity  magnitude relation can be generated . in their model ,",
    "the metallicity  magnitude relation is generated by differences in galaxy formation epoch ( essentially ) and so the prediction of a mass - independent effective yield will hold for their model , just as it holds for our mass - dependent formation epoch model .",
    "we have constructed a simple family of chemical evolution models with the aim of gaining some insight into the origins of many of the trends in sfh with galaxy parameters presented in bdj .",
    "the model is used to generate colour - based ages and metallicities , which are directly comparable with those derived in bdj .",
    "we generated a grid of model galaxies and selected only those which lie in a pre - defined region of the @xmath0 band absolute magnitude  central surface brightness plane .    using this model ,",
    "we have found the following :    * a local gas surface density - dependent schmidt sfl describes many of the colour - based age and metallicity trends from bdj surprisingly well . a model of this type",
    "does not explain the mass dependence in sfh required by bdj and significantly underpredicts the age gradient in spiral galaxies and the slope of the age  central surface brightness correlation . * the global properties of the fiducial model can be improved in either of two ways .",
    "* * a combination of mass - dependent infall and metal enriched outflow imprint independent mass correlations on the galaxy colour - based ages and metallicities . smaller galaxies have a more extended period of inflow in this model , and lose a greater fraction of their freshly - synthesized metals . * * galaxy formation epoch varies systematically with galaxy mass . if less massive galaxies are younger ( i.e.  if they assembled the bulk of their gas content at very late times ) we explain the mass  metallicity and mass  age correlation without resorting to outflow . * regarding the radial variations within galaxies : * * if the infall timescale varies with radius , an age gradient can be generated .",
    "this has little or no effect on the metallicity gradient . *",
    "* alternatively , kennicutt s ( 1998 ) sfl ( which involves both gas density and the dynamical time ) produces both strong age and gas metallicity gradients and a reasonable scatter in the local age / metallicity  surface brightness correlation .",
    "the main shortcoming of this model is a ` backwards ' age / metallicity  magnitude correlation .",
    "one deliberate limitation of our empirical approach is that we do not incorporate our model galaxies into a detailed cosmological context .",
    "for example , cold dark matter cosmologies make well - defined predictions about the formation mechanisms and infall histories of galactic discs that we ignore ( e.g.  steinmetz & mller 1994 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al .",
    "a more realistic treatment of the formation of our initial discs would be desirable , but is sensitive to the poorly understood details of angular momentum evolution in forming disc galaxies ( e.g.  navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "our philosophy has been to determine which of our conclusions seem the most robust to model details , and which may change if our initial disc formation was made more realistic .",
    "our study gives an indication of which of our conclusions ( and those of boissier & prantzos ) are robust : i.e.  which physical processes must operate in any galaxy formation scenario to reproduce the observations . from the above discussion , we find the following .",
    "* gas surface density determines the sfr , although other factors ( such as dynamical time or a critical density for star formation ) may also influence the sfr . * radial dependence in the sfl and/or",
    "the infall history is favoured . *",
    "the infall of gas _ either _ varies strongly with galaxy mass , peaking at late times in low - mass galaxies ( as parameterised by our formation epoch model , e , or the model of boissier & prantzos ) , _ or _",
    "infall varies more weakly with galaxy mass but operates in conjunction with a higher efficiency of metal - enriched outflows in low - mass systems ( models i and o )",
    ". the data ( as it stands ) marginally favours the latter option ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c4outeff ] ) .    however , the last conclusion is strongly dependent on the treatment of very low metallicity galaxies for which our colour - based ages and metallicities are highly uncertain .",
    "a combination of models i and o receives further support from studies of resolved stellar populations : there is ample evidence for older stellar populations in local faint , gas - poor and metal - poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "these can not fit into the mass - dependent age scheme postulated above ( e.g.  grebel 1998 ; hurley - keller , mateo & nemec 1998 ) .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that very low - mass dwarf galaxies have a metallicity  magnitude correlation driven primarily by outflows , and more massive galaxies ( such as spirals , which have managed to keep the bulk of their gas content ) have a metallicity  mass correlation driven primarily by differences in galaxy formation epoch .",
    "the key observable is the effective yield of galaxies : the effective yield gives insight into whether a galaxy is simply under - evolved and metal - poor ( like , perhaps , low surface brightness disc galaxies ; de blok et al .",
    "1996 ; bell et al .",
    "2000 ) or has had the bulk of its metals removed in gas outflows ( as appears likely for dwarf spheroidals : e.g.  dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "what is clear is that more work , both on observational and theoretical fronts , is required to fully elucidate the origin of the mass  metallicity correlation .",
