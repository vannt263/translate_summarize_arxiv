    "as is well known , non - perturbative effects in low energy qcd can be studied with the use of various effective models with four - fermion interaction , such as the instanton model @xcite or the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl )  @xcite .    effective field theories with four - fermion interaction of the nambu  jona - lasinio type , which incorporate the phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , are quite useful in describing the physics of light mesons ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and diquarks @xcite . moreover , on their basis one can study the effects of various external conditions , like temperature and chemical potential  @xcite , and consider the influence of external electromagnetic and gravitational fields . in particular , the role of the njl approach increases , when detailed numerical lattice calculations are not yet admissible in qcd with nonzero baryon density and in the presence of external gauge fields @xcite . moreover , the njl model has also applications in the nuclear physical and astrophysical researches ( e.g. , neutron stars ) as concerns the quark matter  @xcite .",
    "it was proposed more than twenty years ago @xcite that at high baryon densities a colored diquark condensate @xmath1 might appear . in analogy with ordinary superconductivity , this effect was called color superconductivity ( csc ) . in particular , the csc phenomenon was investigated in the framework of the one - gluon exchange approximation in qcd  @xcite , where the formation of diquarks ( colored cooper pairs of quarks ) is predicted self - consistently at extremely high values of the chemical potential @xmath2 mev  @xcite .",
    "one should also mention the use of the bethe - salpeter equation to obtain the diquark masses in the csc phase of cold dense qcd at asymptotically large values of the chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding high baryon densities are not observable in nature and not accessible in experiments . in order to study the problem at lower values of @xmath3 ,",
    "various effective theories for low energy qcd , such as the instanton model @xcite and the nambu@xmath4jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite can be employed . the possibility for the existence of the csc phase in the region of moderate densities",
    "was recently proved ( see , e.g. , the papers  @xcite , as well as the review articles  @xcite and references therein ) . in these papers",
    "it was shown that the diquark condensate @xmath1 can appear already at a rather moderate baryon density ( @xmath5 mev ) .",
    "the conditions favorable for this condensate to be formed can possibly exist in the cores of cold neutron stars .",
    "since quark cooper pairing occurs in the color anti - triplet channel , a nonzero value of @xmath1 means that , apart from the electromagnetic @xmath6 symmetry , the color @xmath7 symmetry should be spontaneously broken inside the csc phase as well . in the framework of njl models",
    "the csc phase formation has generally been considered as a dynamical competition between diquark @xmath1 and usual quark - antiquark condensation @xmath8 .",
    "special attention has been paid to the catalyzing influence of the vacuum color fields on the condensation of diquarks @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , mesons and diquarks in the color neutral superconducting phase of dense cold quark matter were studied in @xcite and nambu - goldstone bosons in the color - asymmetric superconducting phase were considered in the framework of the nambu  jona - lasinio - type model in @xcite .    in several papers , in the framework of the njl model , the influence of a gravitational field on the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath9sb ) due to the creation of a finite quark condensate",
    "@xmath10 has been investigated at zero values of temperature and chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "the study of the combined influences of curvature and temperature has been performed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration for a uniformly accelerated observer due to the thermalization effect of acceleration was studied in  @xcite at zero chemical potential .",
    "further investigations of the influence of the unruh temperature on the phase transitions in dense quark matter with a finite chemical potential , and especially on the restoration of the broken color symmetry in csc were made in @xcite .",
    "one of the widely used methods of accounting for the gravitation is based on the expansion of the fermion propagator in powers of small curvature  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the three - dimensional gross - neveu model in a space - time with a weakly curved two - dimensional surface was investigated , using an effective potential at finite curvature and nonzero chemical potential . in paper",
    "@xcite , this approximation was used in considering the d@xmath9sb at non - vanishing temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it should , however , be mentioned that near the phase transition point , one can not consider the critical curvature @xmath11 to be small and therefore exact solutions with finite values of @xmath11 should be used .",
    "this kind of solution with consideration for the chemical potential and temperature in the gravitational background of a static einstein universe has recently been considered in  @xcite . in all these papers",
    "it was demonstrated that chiral symmetry is restored at high values of the space curvature .",
    "there arises the interesting question , whether similar effects can occur in the study of csc under the influence of a gravitational field .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the influence of temperature , chemical potential and a gravitational field on the creation of the csc state in quark matter .",
    "as is well known , one of the possible models for the expanding universe is the closed friedman model .",
    "however , since the formation of condensates is expected to take place considerably faster than the rate of the universe expansion , its radius in our calculations can be considered as constant .",
    "therefore , as a simple model of gravitation with a given background space - time we assume a static einstein universe . in this case , we will derive an analytical expression for the effective potential of the model by using the mean field approximation , with all the information concerning the chiral and color condensates .",
    "as is known , in a flat space - time , the chemical potential and temperature lead to fairly different effects , i.e. , at large chemical potential , a first order phase transition takes place , while high temperatures lead to the second order phase transition .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the phase structure of the quark matter , in particular csc , in a highly curved space - time in the model of the static einstein universe .",

    "however , with growing value of @xmath145 , the critical values of @xmath83 and @xmath3 increase .",
    "moreover , the oscillation effect clearly visible in the phase curves of fig .",
    "[ pp_t=0 ] should be mentioned .",
    "this may be explained by the discreteness of the fermion energy levels ( [ discrete ] ) in the static gravitational field .",
    "this effect may be compared to the similar effect in the magnetic field @xmath169 , where fermion levels are also discrete ( the landau levels ) .",
    "the corresponding magnetic oscillations of the @xmath170-phase portrait in dense cold quark matter with four - fermion interactions were found in paper @xcite , where it was demonstrated that in the massless case , such a phase structure leads unavoidably to the standard van alphen - de haas magnetic oscillations of some thermodynamical quantities , including magnetization , pressure and particle density , they seem to be here rather an artefact of the njl model . ] .",
    "in addition , we considered also phase transitions at finite temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ pp_r5 ] , @xmath162- and @xmath171- phase portraits are depicted .",
    "no mixed phase with simultaneous nonzero values of @xmath172 can be seen in these plots .",
    "it is clear from fig.[pp_r5 ] that with growing temperature both the chiral and color symmetries are restored .",
    "the similarity of plots in @xmath173 and @xmath174 axes leads one to the conclusion that the parameters of curvature @xmath83 and temperature @xmath168 play similar roles in restoring the symmetries of the system .",
    "for comparison , we also studied the phase portrait for the case of vanishing curvature , @xmath175 .",
    "the obtained result turns out to be very similar to the right picture in fig .",
    "[ pp_r5 ] . in this case , with chemical potential growing from zero , the critical temperature for the transition between phases 1 and 2 decreases from a value slightly higher than 1.5 .",
    "@xmath176{ppg=10_t=035.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{ppg=10_r=3.eps }   \\end{array }      $ ]",
    "by using a static model of curved space - time ( the einstein universe ) , we have derived a nonperturbative expression for the effective potential of the nambu  jona - lasinio model in the mean field approximation .",
    "the corresponding effects of gravitation were exactly taken into account .",
    "this allowed us to consider phase transitions in the vicinity of the critical points .",
    "in particular , we have studied the influence of the chemical potential , the temperature and the curvature on the chiral and color superconducting phase transitions . moreover ,",
    "an oscillation effect of the phase curves was found , which may be explained by the discreteness of the fermion energy levels in the static gravitational field .",
    "the analysis made in this paper demonstrates that the space curvature @xmath83 in certain cases plays an analogous role as the temperature @xmath168 does in the flat space , leading to a second order phase transitions and the restoration of chiral symmetry . on the other hand , at certain values of the chemical potential ( and a sufficiently large coupling constant ) a superconducting phase is formed , and the color symmetry is broken .",
    "however , as might be expected , the chiral and color symmetries become restored at high temperatures and high curvatures . clearly , the simple schematic model of gravitation considered in this work may represent , at best , only qualitative features of the diquark formation , which possibly might occur in the cores of heavy compact objects like neutron stars . much further work has to be done towards a more quantitative and realistic description of the dynamical breaking of chiral and color symmetries in curved space - time .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the important question , whether the predicted csc in cold heavy compact objects like neutron stars might eventually be destroyed by their associated strong gravitational fields .",
    "notice that our investigations were primarily concentrated on the study of csc in the 4-dimensional einstein universe .",
    "it should , however , be mentioned that the phase curves plotted for space dimensions different from 3 demonstrate a considerable similarity with the case studied in this work .",
