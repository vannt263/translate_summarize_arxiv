    "this article will be about discussing the possibilities to characterize _ randomness _ and _ dynamical complexity _ in quantum mechanics and relating this issue to the questions of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we shall try to illustrate , mainly by presenting various numerical examples , a possible ` cyclist approach ' @xcite towards the _ quantum many - body problem _ which is inspired by experiences gained in studies of quantum and classical chaos of one or few particles ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "solving the many body problem in quantum mechanics presents a major challenge from its very beginnings . and",
    "along this way , many ingenious important analytical and efficient numerical methods of solution have been developed , for example bethe ansatz @xcite , later generalized and interpreted as the quantum inverse scattering problem @xcite , real space renormalization group methods @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , and more recently various quantum information - theoretic based time - dependent dmrg ( tdmrg ) @xcite .",
    "the ultimate aim of any of these methods is to efficiently find analytical or numerical approximation to the solution for some of the physical observables in the quantum many body problem , however many methods work only under some specific conditions which are not always well understood . for example , bethe ansatz and quantum inverse scattering work only for a small subset of problems which are _ completely integrable _ , and which may often have very non - generic non - equilibrium properties , such as e.g. ballistic transport at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo techniques represent a very successful set of numerical methods which can yield thermodynamic equilibrium averages for generic ( non - integrable ) systems , however they are practically useless for computing non - equilibrium , or time dependent quantities , such as transport coefficients .",
    "traditional dmrg method @xcite is provably very successful for computing accurate ground state expectation values of almost any physical observables of one - dimensional interacting systems .",
    "and tdmrg @xcite promised to extend the success of dmrg to time dependent physics .",
    "indeed , the first numerical experiments looked very promising , but after a closer look one may realize that they have all been applied to a rather special subset of interacting systems and to a rather special subset of initial states . for generic ( non - integrable ) interacting systems or for sufficiently complex initial states , tdmrg should fail to provide an efficient computation as shall be discussed below . in our view",
    "this is to be expected , and represents an intrinsic characteristic of quantum complexity of such system and should correspond to many body extensions of the phenomena of quantum chaos @xcite where spectra and eigenvector coefficients can be described by statistical ensembles of random matrices . in the past two , almost three decades there has been a lot of activity in the so called field of quantum chaos , or quantum chaology @xcite , where people were trying to understand the essential and significant features of quantum systems which behave chaotically in the classical limit .",
    "classical chaos can be defined in terms of positive ( algorithmic , kolmogorov - chaitin ) complexity of systems orbits . still ,",
    "the question whether such definition of complexity can be in an intuitively sensible way translated to quantum mechanics failed to be answered in spite of many efforts .",
    "it seems that quantum systems of finite ( one or few body ) chaotic systems are generically more robust against imperfections @xcite than their classical counterparts , which is consistent with a simple illustration based on wave - stability of unitary quantum time evolution @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been suggested that exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , the essential characteristics of classically chaotic systems , has many fingerprints in quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , in one of the pioneering works on quantum loschmidt echoes ( or fidelity decay ) , jalabert and pastawski @xcite have shown that in the semi - classical regime , decay of system s sensitivity to external perturbation , as defined by fidelity , is exponential with the rate which can be related to classical lyapunov exponents .",
    "however , this is only true in sufficiently semi - classical regime , where effective planck constant is smaller than effective strength of perturbation , and where fidelity can be essentially explained classically @xcite . on the other hand , in purely quantum regimes , quantum fidelity decays in completely different manner than the classical fidelity , and quite surprisingly displays slower decay for systems with stronger decay of temporal correlations @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall discuss various ergodic properties of a simple toy model of non - integrable interacting quantum many body system , namely kicked ising ( ki ) chain @xcite , and its time - independent version , which ( both ) undergo a transition from integrable to quantum chaotic regimes when the direction of the ( kicking ) magnetic field is changed . by simulating the dynamics of the model in terms of tdmrg",
    "we find that it can be performed efficiently only in the integrable regimes .",
    "being interested in statistical mechanics of the model we shall describe numerical experiments addressing the questions on the relationship between the onset of quantum chaos in ki model and its quantum mixing property , namely the nature of relaxation to equilibrium , and the properties of non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "on one hand we argue that the regime of quantum chaos essentially corresponds to the regime of quantum ergodicity and quantum mixing where diffusive transport laws are valid . on the other hand",
    ", we conjecture that the transition to non - ergodic regime may occur before the system parameters reach the integrable point ( even in thermodynamic limit ) , and that non - ergodic to ergodic transition can be characterized with order parameters which change discontinuously at a critical value of system parameter .",
    "we argue that the process of relaxation to equilibrium in quantum chaotic ( mixing ) case can be described in terms of quantum analogues of ruelle resonances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that the eigenvectors of this process possess a certain scale invariance which can be described by simple power laws .",
    "we also discuss a possibility of numerical calculation of quantum dynamical entropies @xcite in a non - trivial setting of ki model , and find , quite remarkably , that positivity of such dynamical entropies _ does not correspond _ to any other measures of quantum chaos , namely quantum dynamical entropies appear to be positive even in the integrable regimes .",
    "about two thirds of the material presented in this paper constitutes a review of a selection of recent results related to quantum chaos in many - body systems , with a flavor of quantum information .",
    "however , about one third of the material , constituting a major part of section [ sect : statmech ] , is new and original and has not yet been published before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in short section [",
    "sect : definitions ] we review basic definitions of complete integrability and quantum chaos , in particular in the context of many - body systems . in section [",
    "sect : model ] we introduce ki model which will serve us as a very convenient and efficient toy model to numerically demonstrate all the phenomena discussed in this paper . in section [ sect : losch ] we discuss the robustness of quantum systems to external perturbations and decoherence in open quantum systems , mainly as characterized by quantum loschmidt echoes and entanglement between the system and the environment . in section [ sect : mps ] we discuss the time efficiency of best ( known ) classical simulation , namely using tdmrg , of locally interacting 1d quantum systems and its possible dependence on integrability of the model . in section [ sect : transport ] we relate standard criteria of quantum chaos to normal ( diffusive ) versus anomalous ( ballistic ) transport and discuss a simulation of a quantum heat current in non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "in section [ sect : statmech ] we discuss a problem of quantum relaxation to equilibrium , i.e. the quantum mixing property , and quantitative characterization of quantum dynamical complexity .",
    "this section contains a large portion of original intriguing numerical results which support few interesting and perhaps surprising conjectures . in section [",
    "sect : conc ] we conclude and discuss some open problems .",
    "the central issue of this paper is to verify and demonstrate to what extend the _",
    "complete integrability _ affects non - equilibrium properties of quantum many - body systems and their dynamical complexities , and conversely , whether _ ( strong ) non - integrability _ generically coincides with the established criteria of _ quantum chaos_.    let us start by giving some established definitions ( see e.g. @xcite ) of the basic terms needed to understand the issue .",
    "a classical hamiltonian many - body system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom is _ completely integrable _",
    ", if there exist @xmath0 functionally independent global smooth phase space functions ( integrals of motion ) which are mutually in involution , i.e. all poisson brackets among them vanish .",
    "in such a case global canonical transformation to canonical _ action - angle _ variables can be constructed , and dynamics can be explicitly solved - at least in principle . for locally interacting _ infinite _ systems ( @xmath1 ) analytic methods for an explicit construction of integrals of motion and canonical action - angle variables",
    "are known which usually go under a common name of _ inverse scattering method_. explicit solution by a mapping to an iso - spectral sch \" rodinger problem in terms of inverse scattering technique is usually understood as a definition of _ complete integrability _ in such context .    definition of _ quantum complete integrability _ is less unique .",
    "nevertheless , algebraic , non - commutative versions of the inverse scattering technique exist and can be applied to some quantum interacting lattices in one - dimension , generalizing the famous bethe ansatz solution of the heisenberg spin @xmath2 chain , and this is used as the most general known definition of _ quantum complete integrability_. other versions of integrability for finite @xmath0 quantum systems have been proposed but they do not correspond to the integrability of the underlying classical limit , if the latter exists , so these ideas will not be considered in this paper .    it has not been generally accepted yet , though demonstrated in many occasions , that completely integrable quantum systems constitute only a small subset of physical models and posses many exceptional ( non - generic ) non - equilibrium dynamical properties , like for example anomalous transport at finite temperatures ( see e.g.@xcite . )    on the other extreme of ergodic hierarchy we have chaotic systems .",
    "in classical hamiltonian dynamics of few particles , chaos is best defined in terms of positive algorithmic ( kolmogorov ) complexity of systems trajectories , or equivalently , by exponential sensitivity to initial conditions . however , bounded quantum systems of finite number of particles can not be dynamically complex as their excitation spectrum is discrete , and hence the evolution is necessarily quasi - periodic ( or almost periodic ) . still , quite surprisingly , even for such systems certain dynamical properties are _ random _ and _ universal _ , if the underlying classical limit is sufficiently strongly chaotic @xcite .",
    "but genuine dynamical complexity may emerge in thermodynamic limit . however , there is still no completely satisfactory definition of dynamical chaos for infinite quantum systems .",
    "the commonly used working definition is the reference with the _ random matrix theory _",
    "@xcite , namely the many - body quantum system is said to be quantum chaotic if its excitation spectrum or some other dynamical properties can be ( on certain energy , or time scale ) well described by ensembles of random hermitian matrices with appropriate symmetry properties .",
    "throughout this paper we shall use , either for illustration of theoretical results , or for numerical experimental studies , the following 1d locally interacting quantum lattice system , namely a chain of @xmath0 qubits , or spin @xmath2 particles , coupled with nearest neighbour ising interaction and periodically kicked with spatially homogeneous , but _ arbitrarily oriented _ magnetic field . in a suitable dimensionless units our model can be written in terms of a three - parameter periodic time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath3 @xmath4 is a unit - periodic dirac delta and @xmath5 are the usual pauli spin variables on a finite lattice @xmath6 , satisfying the commutation ( lie ) algebra @xmath7=\\sum_\\gamma 2\\ii\\varepsilon_{\\alpha \\beta\\gamma } \\delta_{jk } { \\sigma^{\\gamma}_{j}}$ ] .",
    "sometimes it will turn fruitful if we extend the set of pauli matrices by identity matrix and assign them a numerical superscript @xmath8 , namely @xmath9 .",
    "the finite chain will often be treated with _ periodic boundary conditions _ , @xmath10 , and sometimes the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) @xmath1 will be considered , in particular when we shall study the statistical mechanics of ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in section [ sect : statmech ] .",
    "although kicked hamiltonian one - particle models have been very popular in the field of nonlinear dynamics and quantum chaos for decades , for example the chirikov s kicked rotator model @xcite , the use of kicked systems in quantum many body physics has been so far very limited . if one is not only interested in zero temperature ( ground state ) or low temperature physics , then as we shall try to demonstrate in this review , kicked many - body models like ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) provide simpler and clearer phenomenological picture of global dynamics than time - independent models .",
    "the main reason is that since energy is not a conserved quantity , the entire hilbert space of many - body configurations is accessible for non - integrable dynamics , and the notions of quantum ergodicity and mixing ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for definitions and further references ) can be defined more clearly than in the time - independent , autonomous setting .",
    "perhaps the first kicked interacting quantum lattice has been introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "even if in traditional solid state physics such kicked dynamics would represent un - physically strong excitations , one has to realize that kicked quantum chains could be attractive options as benchmark models of quantum state manipulation and quantum computation in optical lattices .",
    "the _ kicked ising _ ( ki ) model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) has been defined for the first time in ref.@xcite , generalizing the integrable ki model with transverse field introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "clearly , as shown there @xcite for the case of _ transverse _ field , @xmath11 , the time - dependent model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be considered _",
    "completely integrable _ since it can be solved explicitly , for example by wigner - jordan - bogoliubov transformation to non - interacting spinless fermions , and a large class of its time correlation functions can be calculated explicitly .",
    "in addition , an infinite sequence of local conserved quantities ( integrals of motion ) can be constructed in such a case .",
    "there is another , trivial _",
    "completely integrable _ regime of ki model , namely the case of _ longitudinal _ field , @xmath12 yet another , more non - trivial _ completely integrable _ regime of ki model is found when the magnitude of dimensionless field is a multiple of @xmath13 , namely @xmath14 , since then the magnetic kick can be considered as a multiple of @xmath15 rotation , and generated by a slightly obscure set of non - interacting spinless fermions .    however , in a general case of titled magnetic field when both components @xmath16 and @xmath17 are non - vanishing , and @xmath18 is non - integer , the model is non - integrable , and is conjectured to be not amenable to exact analytical methods . as discussed in the following sections , non - integrable ki model can display a variety of regimes according to the criteria of quantum chaos , quantum ergodicity and quantum mixing .",
    "in fact , recently the spectral statistics of ki model in strongly non - integrable regime has been studied in detail and random matrix behaviour has been clearly confirmed at short energy ranges @xcite .    due to kicked nature of interaction , the evolution propagator of ki model for one unit period of time ( the so - called floquet operator ) , starting just before the kick , can be constructed explicitly in terms of a time - ordered product @xmath19 the last line suggests a simple efficient quantum protocol to simulate ki model in terms of simple 1-qubit @xmath20 and 2-qubit @xmath21 quantum gates . if we write a compact kicked ising 2-qubit gate @xmath22 and introduce a left - to - right ordered operator product , namely @xmath23 , then we can write ki protocol as a simple string of @xmath24gates @xmath25    the ki model has a better known autonomous limit , namely time - independent ising chain in a tilted magnetic field @xmath26 which is again non - integrable unless the field is transverse @xmath27 , or longitudinal @xmath28 .",
    "one of the central questions about the dynamics of complex quantum systems is their robustness against small imperfections in the hamiltonian . while it is clear that due to unitarity the quantum evolution is stable against variation of initial states @xcite , it is not so clear how stable it is against variation of the hamiltonian , either being static or time - dependent - perhaps even noisy .",
    "let us write the hamiltonian as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath31 is a hermitian perturbation operator and @xmath32 is a small perturbation parameter .",
    "peres @xcite proposed the following measure of stability of quantum evolution : let us start from some fixed initial state @xmath33 , and write the time evolutions of this state generated with the unperturbed and perturbed hamiltonian , as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . then the stability is characterized by fidelity , _",
    "i.e. _ the squared overlap between these two states @xmath36    there are two alternative interpretations of quantum fidelity : ( i ) one can interpret ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) as a _ quantum loschmidt echo _ , namely the probability that the initial state @xmath33 , which is propagated forward with perturbed evolution @xmath37 , and after that propagated backwards in time with unperturbed evolution @xmath38 , is again measured in the same ( initial ) state .",
    "alternatively ( ii ) is just the square modulus of expectation value of the unitary echo operator @xmath39 which is the quantum propagator in the _ interaction picture_.    there have been three main theoretical approaches to understanding of fidelity decay in quantum dynamical systems :      in a seminal work jalabert and pastawski derived quantum loschmidt echo for systems which posses well defined classical limit .",
    "they have shown that under certain conditions , namely that the perturbation strength is large enough - typically larger than appropriately scaled planck constant , and that initial states have certain classical interpretations - like coherent states , position states , etc , the quantum loschmidt echo decays exponentially @xmath40 with the rate @xmath41 which is _ perturbation independent _ and typically equals the lyapunov exponent of the underlying classical dynamics . more recently",
    "a completely classical interpretation of this so - called lyapunov decay has been given @xcite in terms of _ the classical loschmidt echo _ and a theory for exponents @xmath41 has been developed in terms of the full spectrum of lyapunov exponents for classical dynamical systems with few @xcite or many @xcite degrees of freedom .      in the opposite regime , where the scaled planck constant is bigger than the perturbation strength @xmath32 , one can use time - dependent quantum perturbation theory to second order to derive a simple linear response formula for fidelity decay @xcite @xmath42 in terms of 2-point time correlation function of the perturbation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the perturbation operator in the interaction picture and @xmath45 is an expectation value in the initial state .    from this formula - which can be viewed as a kind of kubo - like linear response theory for dissipation of quantum information",
    ", an interesting conclusion can be drawn : fidelity decays faster for systems with slower decay of temporal correlations , or alternatively phrased , quantum system is more robust against external perturbations if it relaxes to equilibrium faster .",
    "one can actually go beyond the second order perturbation theory , and sum up the born series for fidelity to all orders in many specific situations @xcite .",
    "since we are here mainly interested in qubit ( spin 1/2 ) chains , we shall only review specific results for kicked ising chain @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss three different specific values of system parameters , in all three we take @xmath46 : ( a ) integrable regime of transverse field @xmath27 , ( b ) weakly non - integrable regime with @xmath47 , and ( c ) strongly non - integrable regime with @xmath48 .",
    "all the results , correlation functions and fidelity , are for random initial states , which can be interpreted as pure states of maximum quantum information , and averaging over random states is equivalent to a tracial state @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the evolution operator ( [ eq : floquet ] ) and perturb it by changing the magnetic field such that the perturbation is generated by the transverse component of the magnetization @xmath50 , namely @xmath51^t$ ] .    in the integrable case , or in general , in non - ergodic case ,",
    "where the correlation function @xmath52 ( note that @xmath53 ) approaches a non - vanishing plateau value as @xmath54 , namely time averaged fluctuation of magnetization @xmath55 is non - vanishing @xmath56 , one can sum up born series to all orders , yielding a gaussian decay of fidelity @xmath57 the only assumptions are that @xmath58 is long enough for the time average in the definition of @xmath59 to converge , and short enough that fidelity is still above the finite size plateau value @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath59 can be considered as an analog of drude weight or charge stiffness in the linear response solid state transport theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in figs.([fig",
    ": corr],[fig : fid ] ) ( a , b ) one can observe the correlation plateaus of correlation functions for integrable and weakly non - integrable cases and respective good agreement with a gaussian decay of fidelity ( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "note that in the integrable case the correlation function and the plateau @xmath59 have been calculated also analytically @xcite .",
    "note that for comparing different lattice sizes @xmath0 a size - scaled value of the perturbation strength @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , has been fixed rather than @xmath32 itself .",
    "one the other hand , for sufficiently strong integrability breaking , say in case ( c ) of ki model , the correlation function @xmath63 decays to zero in tl , which can be interpreted as quantum mixing behviour .",
    "it has been found that quantum mixing behaviour typically corresponds to random matrix ( quasi)energy level statistics , see e.g. ref.@xcite and the subsequent sections of the present paper .",
    "we shall call such behaviour the regime of quantum chaos . here again , born series for fidelity can be summed up to all orders , yielding an exponential decay @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a transport coefficient .",
    "the assumptions for validity of ( [ eq : ne ] ) are that @xmath58 is larger than a characteristic mixing time scale on which @xmath66 decays and short enough so that finite size effects in quantum correlation function @xmath66 does not yet affect the transport coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "this regime of fidelity decay is sometimes referred to as the fermi golden rule regime .",
    "again , as demonstrated in figs .",
    "( [ fig : corr],[fig : fid])c the agreement of numerical data for ki model with the theory is excellent .",
    "note that decay time of fidelity scales as @xmath68 for ergodic and mixing dynamics , and as @xmath69 for non - ergodic dynamics , making the latter much more sensitive to small perturbations .",
    "complex quantum systems can often be well described by statistical ensembles of hamiltonians @xcite . assuming that @xmath30 and @xmath31 both belong to canonical ensembles of gaussian random matrices",
    ", one can evaluate ensemble averages of the fidelity and relate @xmath66 to the spectral form factor of the underlying random matrix ensemble .",
    "the perturbative ( linear response ) theory has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore a non - perturbative ( super - symmetric ) averaging has been successfully applied to obtain exact expressions for average fidelity amplitude in the most interesting cases @xcite .",
    "rmt theory of fidelity has been successfully applied to chaotic quantum systems and even to several experimental situations @xcite .    following more applied philosophy ,",
    "groups from toulouse and como have performed a series of numerical experiments @xcite analyzing the robustness of several reasonable models of quantum computer hardware under small imperfections , being either due to ( static ) unwanted inter - qubit coupling or due to stochastic ( noisy ) unwanted coupling to the environment , when performing quantum algorithms simulating various toy models of classical and quantum single - particle chaos @xcite , like for example quantum kicked rotator @xcite .",
    "the numerical results are in line with a general linear response theory , stating that static perturbations are in general more dangerous than noisy ones .",
    "similar thinking as in the previous subsection can be applied to perhaps even more fundamental problem of quantum physics , to the problem of decoherence @xcite . here",
    "we shall limit ourselves to an abstract unitary model of decoherence , where we treat a complete unitary evolution over two subsystems , a central system c , and an environment e , and then address a relevant information about the central system ( i.e. the part of the system which is of physical interest ) by partially tracing over the environment .",
    "such a discussion can indeed be followed with a close link to the problem of loschmidt echoes , by writing the total hamiltonian @xmath29 as an ideal ( unperturbed ) separable evolution @xmath70 perturbed by a small coupling @xmath31 between the system and the environment .",
    "we shall also assume that we start from initial pure state which is a product state @xmath71 we are interested in the properties of a generally mixed state of the central system obtained by partial tracing over the environment @xmath72\\ ] ] then , under an ideal evolution , the state of the system remains a product state at all times ,",
    "so the state of the central system remains pure and there is no decoherence .",
    "decoherence is usually characterized in terms of decaying off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath73 in a suitable pointer state basis , for example in the eigenbasis of the central system hamiltonian @xmath74 .",
    "in fact for certain special forms of the perturbation operator @xmath31 , the magnitudes of off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath73 can be literally written as fidelities , or quantum loschmidt echoes , in the evolution of the environment perturbed by system - environment coupling @xcite . in such framework",
    ", the lyapunov regime of fidelity decay corresponds exactly to the lyapunov growth of decoherence discussed by zurek and paz @xcite .    however , another interesting indicator of decoherence is the growth of _ bi - partite entanglement _ between the system and the environment .",
    "perhaps this notion is even more general since it does not depend on a particular choice of the pointer state basis .",
    "since the state of the universe ( central system + environment ) is always pure , the characterization of entanglement is easy , say in terms of von neuman entropy of @xmath73 , @xmath75 , or linear entropy @xmath76 which is a negative logarithm of purity @xmath77 .",
    "usually , the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 essentially give equivalent results - namely they can both be interpreted as the logarithm of an effective rank of the state @xmath73 , but the linear entropy , or purity , is more amenable to analytical calculations .    again considering chaotic models for the central system and the environment ,",
    "miller and sarkar @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have been able to observe the lyapunov regime of entanglement growth , namely @xmath78 is for sufficiently strong perturbations @xmath32 found to grow linearly @xmath80 with the rate @xmath81 which is perturbation independent and given by ( the sum of positive ) classical lyapunov exponents of the unperturbed , separated ( sub)systems .",
    "on the other hand , in the purely quantum regime of small perturbation @xmath32 , again typically smaller than effective planck constant , one can use time - dependent perturbation theory and derive perturbation dependent entanglement entropy @xcite , namely the purity can be explicitly expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a particular integrated correlation function of the perturbation . in this regime",
    "we again find that quantum systems , and quantum environments , which display faster relaxation to equilibrium , are more robust against decoherence due to typical couplings .",
    "for studies of bi - partite entanglement , in particular in ki model system , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "there exists even closer connection to fidelity theory , namely one can prove a general inequality @xcite stating that purity is always bounded by the square of fidelity @xmath84 in other words : @xmath85 gives an upper bound for the growth of the linear entanglement entropy , @xmath86 .    in a slightly different context , _ bit - wise _ entanglement between a pair of qubits of a quantum register representing a time dependent quantum state , where the rest of the register is considered as an environment , has been demonstrated to be an indicator of quantum chaos @xcite and even a signature of classical chaos @xcite .",
    "in the theory of classical dynamical systems there is a fundamental difference between integrable and chaotic systems as outlined in section [ sect : definitions ] .",
    "chaotic systems , having positive algorithmic complexity , unlike the integrable ones , can not be simulated for arbitrary times with a finite amount of information about their initial states",
    ". computational complexity of individual chaotic trajectories is linear in time , however , if one wants to describe statistical states ( phase space distributions ) or observables of chaotic classical systems , up to time @xmath58 , exponential amount of computational resources is needed , typically @xmath87 where @xmath81 is the kolmogorov s dynamical entropy related to exponential sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "but on the other hand , how difficult is it to simulate isolated and bounded quantum systems of many interacting particles using classical resources ?",
    "in analogy with the classical ( chaotic ) case , we might expect that the best classical simulation of typical quantum systems ( in tl ) is exponentially hard , i.e. the amount of computing resources is expected to grow exponentially with time .    even though there is no exponential sensitivity to initial conditions in quantum mechanics",
    ", there is a tensor - product structure of the many - body quantum state space which makes its dimension to scale exponentially with the number of particles , as opposed to linear scaling in the classical case , and due to presence of entanglement generic quantum time evolution can not be reduced to ( efficient ) classical computation in terms of non - entangled ( classical like ) states . here",
    "we propose the idea to use _ the computation complexity of best possible classical simulation of quantum dynamics , as a measure of quantum algorithmic complexity_. this section essentially reviews the article @xcite .",
    "we note that our proposal is different from existing proposals of quantum algorithmic complexity @xcite , namely we consider merely the classical complexity of ( best ) classical simulations of quantum states . in the sense of mora and briegel @xcite , quantum algorithmic complexity _ per unit time _ of initially simple time - evolving quantum states propagated by locally interacting hamiltonian @xmath88 is clearly vanishing , since an approximate quantum circuit which reproduces the state after time @xmath58 is a simple repetition of trotter - suzuki decomposition of @xmath89 .",
    "recently , a family of numerical methods for the simulation of interacting many - body systems has been developed @xcite which is usually referred to as time - dependent density - matrix - renormalization group ( tdmrg ) , and which has been shown to provide an efficient classical simulation of some interacting quantum systems . of course , it can not be proven that tdmrg provides the best classical simulation of quantum systems , but it seems that it is by now the best method available .",
    "simulations of locally interacting one - dimensional quantum lattices were actually shown rigorously to be efficient in the number @xmath0 of particles @xcite ( i.e. , computation time and memory resources scale as polynomial functions of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath58 , whereas here we are interested in the scaling of computation time and memory with physical time @xmath58 ( in tl , @xmath90 ) , referred to as _",
    "time efficiency_.    in this section we address the question of time efficiency implementing tdmrg for a family of ising hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamaut ] ) which undergoes a transition from integrable ( transverse ising ) to non - integrable quantum chaotic regime as the magnetic field is varied .",
    "we mainly consider time evolution in operator spaces @xcite , say of density matrices of quantum states , or ( quasi ) local operator algebras .",
    "note that time evolution of pure states is often ill defined in tl @xcite . as a quantitative measure of time efficiency",
    "we define and compute the minimal dimension @xmath91 of matrix product operator ( mpo ) representation of quantum states / observables which describes time evolution up to time @xmath58 within fidelity @xmath92 .",
    "our main question concerns possible scaling of @xmath91 for different types of dynamics , and indeed we shall demonstrate a correspondence between , respectively , quantum chaos or integrability , and exponential or polynomial growth of @xmath91 .    the key idea of operator - valued tdmrg @xcite is to represent any operator in a matrix product form , @xmath93 in terms of @xmath94 matrices @xmath95 of fixed dimension @xmath96 .",
    "the number of parameters in the mpo representation is @xmath97 and for sufficiently large @xmath96 it can describe any operator .",
    "in fact , the minimal @xmath96 required equals to the maximal rank of the reduced super - density - matrix over all bi - partitions of the chain .",
    "the advantage of mpo representation lies in the fact that doing an elementary local one or two qubit unitary transformation @xmath98 can be done locally , affecting only a pair of neighboring matrices @xmath95 .",
    "we will illustrate evolution of ising chain ( [ eq : hamaut ] ) , with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions , for two different magnetic field values : ( i ) an integrable ( regular ) case @xmath99 with transverse magnetic field , and ( ii ) non - integrable ( quantum chaotic ) case @xmath100 with@xmath101 tilted magnetic field . to confirm that @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , indeed represent generic quantum chaotic , and regular , system , respectively , we calculated level spacing distribution ( lsd ) of their spectra ( shown in fig .

    "in the present article we have reviewed several possible approaches to describe dynamic instabilities , relaxation phenomena , and computation complexity in the simple model of one - dimensional non - integrable locally interacting quantum many body dynamics .",
    "we have argued that the essential non - equilibrium statistical properties of quantum dynamical systems - in the absence of idealized external baths - may be crucially related to the integrability of the system , or in the complementary case , to the existence of the regime of quantum chaos .",
    "the general flavor which remains after such studies is that the non - integrable quantum many body problem at high temperature will preclude any exact and complete solution by its very nature .",
    "still it is hoped that a more complete ergodic theory of such systems could be developed , allowing for example for exact calculation of relaxation rates , scaling exponents of resonance eigenvectors , etc .",
    "it has been shown in many cases that integrable quantum systems have anomalous non - equilibrium statistical mechanics at high temperature , for example they exhibit ballistic transport .",
    "this can easily be understood as being a consequence of existence of ( an infinite sequence of ) exact local conservation laws which prevents quantum ergodicity , similarly as existence of canonical action variables in classical integrable systems prevents classical ergodicity .",
    "an interesting open question is the following : how strong integrability breaking perturbation is needed , in generic cases , to break all the exact conservation laws and yield normal ( diffusive ) transport ?",
    "in other words : a quantum kam theory is needed !",
    "numerical experiments shown in this paper suggest an interesting possibility , namely that in some cases a finite , critical perturbation strength is required .",

    "<S> the problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and discussed from several different perspectives : ( i ) stability of motion against external perturbations and decoherence , ( ii ) efficiency of quantum simulation in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator spaces , ( iii ) quantum transport , relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing , and ( iv ) computation of quantum dynamical entropies . </S>",
    "<S> discussions of all these criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or quantum chaos , and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found . </S>",
