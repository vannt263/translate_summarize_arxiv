    "the observation of quantum - interference effects in many - body systems is often deterred by the very short coherence times displayed by quantum pure - states in nature .",
    "this affects in particular cooperative states resulting from interaction - dominated phases in many - body systems .",
    "these states have important applications in quantum computation and nanoelectronics because interaction is key to develop control mechanisms .",
    "in contrast to pure states , mixed states are less prone to be demolished by decoherence @xcite , especially when they correspond to equilibrium states because their entropies are maximal and the system can not loss any more information to the environment . as a result",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the observation of specific effects in many - body systems through thermodynamic states is feasible , even practical , as long as it be possible to easily keep the system in equilibrium .",
    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are physical processes arising from a change in the ground state structure of a system as a parameter crosses a transition - or - critical point @xcite .",
    "these transitions occur at zero temperature and they are strongly influenced by quantum correlations .",
    "in fact , it is known that the amount of entanglement present in a system is maximal at , or close to , the critical point of a second order qpt @xcite .",
    "the universality class of a qpt is determined by the power law exponents that define the scaling behavior of characteristic variables in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "recently , there has been interest in knowing how correlations , either classical or quantum , behave at finite temperature in models showing well understood qpts @xcite .",
    "these investigations have been made using canonical ensemble theory : the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with a bath at fixed temperature and the number of particles is fixed .",
    "in contrast , applications of the grand - canonical - ensemble theory to the same kind of systems are , to the best of the authors knowledge , not available so far .",
    "the element that is added in the grand canonical formulation is the notion of fluctuations of the number of particles . in this case",
    "an open quantum system interacts with a bath in such a way that not only energy but also particles can be exchanged .",
    "this additional consideration might better describe the conditions encountered in some low - temperature and solid - state experiments .",
    "let us consider a system governed by the following hamiltonian @xmath0 the operators that describe the hamiltonian follow bosonic commuting relations @xmath1=[\\hat{a}_2,\\hat{a}_2^{\\dagger}]=1 $ ] and @xmath2=0 $ ] .",
    "symbols @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the number of particles and the intensity of the interaction among bosons respectively . by definition @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian has been normalized so that @xmath4 is dimensionless and the energy unit is half the energy difference between the eigenenergies of @xmath6 . in this letter only the case @xmath7 is considered .",
    "it is possible to change the sign of the single particle term so that it better resembles a kinetic energy contribution applying a unitary transformation producing @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this scheme can be seen as a simple model describing a system of cold atoms tunneling between symmetric adjacent wells and undergoing attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it is known that in actual experiments both the double - well profile and the interaction intensity can be controlled to a great degree @xcite .",
    "usually , the confining profile is realized using counter - propagating laser beams that form a periodic super - lattice while the interaction can be tuned applying a magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite . in numerical studies",
    "it is useful to exploit the fact that @xmath10 commutes with the following operators , @xmath11 these commutation properties imply that the eigenstates of ( [ eq:1 ] ) display fixed number of particles and , for non - degenerate spectra , parity .",
    "this latter symmetry emerges as a consequence of the invariance of the hamiltonian under the swap of labels ( wells ) 1@xmath122 .",
    "the system behavior is determined by the trade - off between hopping and attractive interaction .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be written in terms of angular momenta through the following schwinger transformation , @xmath13 inserting these identities in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and after a few arrangements we arrive to , @xmath14 which corresponds to a particular case of the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite . the hamiltonian form shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) has been extensively studied with reference to , among many others , its scaling behavior @xcite , energy spectrum @xcite , correlations at finite temperature @xcite and applications to quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "if the angular momenta are written as sums of spins , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are pauli matrices , the model becomes @xmath17 in this notation , and up to a constant factor , the model is known as the infinite range ising model because the interaction among spins is completely homogeneous with respect to the spin index .",
    "it is worth mentioning that hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) is not completely equivalent to hamiltonian ( [ eq:33 ] ) , as can be seen by comparing their respective hilbert space dimensions .",
    "indeed , the sums of spins give rise to various irreducible representations of hamiltonian ( [ eq:4 ] ) corresponding to different values of total angular momentum . the representation with the biggest total angular momentum corresponds to hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that , up to an additive constant proportional to @xmath3 , hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) is the bosonic second - quantization of hamiltonian ( [ eq:33 ] ) and as such it is spanned by the symmetric states of the spin basis .",
    "this affects the density of states and eventually derives in the fact that hamiltonians ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) exhibit a qpt as well as a phase transition at finite temperature , while hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) displays only a qpt .",
    "such a qpt can be studied by assuming that the ground state is given as follows @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is bounded to the interval @xmath20 $ ] in order to avoid redundancies .",
    "the angle @xmath19 takes the value that minimizes the energy @xmath21 after some direct calculations we obtain to leading order in @xmath3 @xmath22 otherwise @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "canonical ensemble theory dictates that the statistical state becomes @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the qpt is characterized by a structural change in the spectrum of the hamiltonian , which goes from a gaped phase with non - degenerate energy levels for @xmath26 , to a gapless phase with a double degeneration of every level @xcite for @xmath28 .",
    "such a change in the density of states takes place only in the limit @xmath29 ( the thermodynamic limit ) and is marked by a discontinuity at @xmath30 in the second derivative of the rescaled free energy @xcite . as the free energy is continuous at the critical point , the transition is classified as a second order qpt .",
    "neither @xmath31 nor @xmath32 are invariant under parity transformations , because they display different occupation numbers at each side of the double well .",
    "contrariwise , both state ( [ eq : gambler ] ) and @xmath25 are invariant , and as such it can be said that symmetry is preserved across the critical point as long as the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium so that the transition be reversible .",
    "the general purpose of this work is to analyze the thermodynamic properties of a system governed by hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) using the grand canonical formalism , i.e. , assuming that the number of particles is not fixed but subject to statistical fluctuations determined by the characteristic conditions of a surrounding bath . in particular , it is of interest to examine whether signatures of the aforementioned qpt can be in any way seen in the resulting framework .",
    "the underlying intention is to establish a connection of physical significance between the properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit and its finite size structure as a whole .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model is determined by the grand canonical partition function , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 indicate the inverse temperature and chemical potential respectively . for a set of parameters @xmath4 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 , a corresponding state in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "is well defined as long as @xmath36 converges to a positive real number .",
    "one way of ensuring convergence is by requiring that the terms having large @xmath3 in ( [ eq:3 ] ) go to zero fast enough as @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "a convergence analysis can be done using the fact that the system ground - state energy in the thermodynamic limit @xmath37 is known .",
    "it is in this way found that in order to guarantee the convergence of @xmath36 the interaction parameter must fulfill @xmath38 , where @xmath39 if @xmath40 , and    @xmath41    if @xmath42 . the range of valid values for which @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath35 must be negative , it can be argued that thermodynamic equilibrium takes place as the instability produced by the attractive interaction , which drives the atoms to cluster up uncontrollably , is balanced out by the effect of the bath , which rations the number of particles available to the system . as the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath35",
    "is well defined in either direction , the variables can be used interchangeably .",
    "the grand partition function @xmath36 is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) by numerically diagonalizing a set of hamiltonians @xmath10 and then using their respective energy spectra to find the trace for each value of @xmath3 .",
    "the maximum @xmath3 is chosen so that @xmath36 converges to a tolerance of @xmath46 .",
    "the mean value of an observable @xmath47 can be computed as a weighted average over the ensemble thus    @xmath48    finding @xmath36 as well as the mean number of particles and the energy requires only the eigenenergies .",
    "this is computationally faster than finding quantities that require eigenvectors in addition . inside the range of parameters",
    "for which the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) converges , the numerical simulations show that the grand potential as well as its derivatives are smooth functions of @xmath4 , even at @xmath30 , although they all diverge toward infinity when @xmath49 .",
    "this tendency is depicted in figure [ fig1 ] for the case of @xmath36 and the mean number of particles .",
    "the lack of discontinuities , and therefore of critical points , can be justified by the observation that contributions to the partition function must decrease with increasing @xmath3 , suppressing in this way the contribution of the limit @xmath29 , where the original qft takes place .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath10 is non - degenerate as long as @xmath3 be finite , a phase transition in the form of a sudden change in the density of states is frustrated .",
    "a natural question in this context is whether one can approach the qpt by standing close to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this would allow to appreciate how the qpt arises gradually .",
    "interestingly , such an approach is invalid because @xmath36 only converges for @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the path chosen here is to consider the behavior of @xmath36 when the parameter @xmath4 is very close to @xmath45 and the average number of particles is high . as shown by figure [ fig1 ] , @xmath36 diverges following a power law with a peculiar feature .",
    "the scaling exponent is @xmath52 for any valid value of @xmath45 , except for @xmath53 , where the exponent becomes @xmath54 .",
    "the scaling exponent being different precisely when @xmath45 equals the critical point of the underlying qft suggests that such a point has non - trivial connotations for the finite size statistics of the problem . notice that since the grand partition function is a sum of terms coming from systems of different size , in this problem the finite size statistics has a collective component , involving contributions of independent @xmath10 .",
    "in order to explore the origin of the observed features , let us first consider the exact grand partition function    @xmath55    non - linear terms in the exponential complicate the calculation of the sum by analytic means . as a workaround ,",
    "the following linearization scheme is proposed @xcite ,    @xmath56    the connection between ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) follows from the identity @xmath57 .",
    "this step can be seen as a mean field approach and is justified by the observation that finite size properties close to the thermodynamic limit are well captured by a mean field treatment @xcite .",
    "since this approximation gets better for large @xmath3 , it is suitable to make estimations of @xmath36 close to the divergence point . the trace and the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) can be worked out analytically because the exponential s argument is a linear operator .",
    "the sum converges when @xmath58 , in which case the result can be written as @xmath59 where    @xmath60    as @xmath49 , only @xmath61 diverges .",
    "close to @xmath45 the _ csch _ can be expanded and the resulting expression can be integrated , thus yielding @xmath62 to approximate this integral , the exponential term is kept constant and the rest of the denominator is expanded in power series in @xmath63 around the position of its minima . for @xmath64 , there is only one minimum at @xmath65 and the first three non vanishing terms of the expansion are kept . for @xmath66 ,",
    "there are two equal minima located at @xmath67 and only the first two non vanishing terms of the expansion are required .",
    "the resulting expression can be solved and the scaling behavior close to @xmath45 can be worked out from the solution . assuming that the original grand partition function displays the same scaling properties than the approximated expression , it is possible to write @xmath36 as follows . if @xmath68 then @xmath69 otherwise , when @xmath42 @xmath70 in such a way that the limits of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as @xmath49 keeping @xmath34 constant are all finite .",
    "the procedure also provides the following estimates @xmath74 and @xmath75 owing to the nature of the approximations involved in the derivation , it is expected that these estimations work better for values of @xmath4 close to @xmath45 and as such they could reproduce the correct scaling of thermodynamic variables in such a limit .",
    "the grand partition function determines in great measure the system s statistics and a number of mean values can be obtained as derivatives of the grand potential",
    ". simple relations between important observables can be formulated by focusing on their behavior near the divergence , which is dominated by a few terms . using ( [ pera ] ) , ( [ mango ] ) , ( [ uva ] ) and ( [ sandia ] ) it can be shown that close to @xmath45 the mean number of particles , which is found from @xmath76 , scales as @xmath77 this result can be checked against a numerical evaluation of eq . ( [ guitar ] ) taking @xmath78 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig1 ] shows that the two approaches coincide well for values of @xmath79 below @xmath80 in three representative cases . the fact that the divergence coefficient changes discontinuously from @xmath81 to @xmath82 at @xmath53 underscores a trait that could prove useful as a way of verification of the critical point of the underlying qpt at any temperature .",
    "analogously , the coefficient reaches its maximum value at this point , allowing for an enhanced transfer of particles from the environment to the system .",
    "it is also relevant to consider the behavior displayed by the interaction term @xmath83 the mean value associated to this quantity could be measured , for example , by counting the number of particles in each mode , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and then averaging @xmath86 over measurements obtained from identically prepared setups having the same @xmath4 , @xmath87 and @xmath34 .",
    "the interaction mean - value can be obtained from the analytical estimation of @xmath36 as @xmath88 . near the divergence",
    "the resulting expression can be written as @xmath89 where in every case @xmath90 is given by ( [ peru ] ) . a comparison with numerical results obtained by direct application of eq .",
    "( [ guitar ] ) taking @xmath91 can be seen in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "since this computation requires eigenvectors , it is not as easy to reach bigger values of @xmath90 for which a better agreement between analytics and numerics is expected .",
    "the proportionality coefficient between @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a continuous , but not smooth , function of @xmath45 at @xmath53 .",
    "the system s energy can also be obtained from @xmath36 as @xmath94 . in this case differentiation with respect to @xmath34",
    "does not contribute divergence terms and the energy becomes simply @xmath95 it can be checked using ( [ bocachico ] ) and ( [ mojarra ] ) that the proportionality coefficient ( @xmath35 ) and its derivative are continuous functions of @xmath45 . a comparison with a direct application of eq .",
    "( [ guitar ] ) , this time making @xmath96 , can be seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it becomes in this way apparent that the functionality of @xmath36 with respect to the problem s parameters has been correctly captured by eqs .",
    "( [ pera ] ) , ( [ mango ] ) , ( [ uva ] ) and ( [ sandia ] ) in the region close to the divergence and that there exist features that would allow to identify the point @xmath53 in a practical scenario .",
    "let us now go back the fact that the qpt studied here , which is formulated in connection to canonical - ensemble theory in section [ intro ] , can not be seen as an emergent phenomenon in the thermodynamics resulting from the grand canonical formalism in section [ gca ] .",
    "this might appear a little odd since it is known from numerics that hamiltonians @xmath10 with large @xmath3 display results that asymptotically approach those in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although no attempt will be made here to provide a simple justification for this behavior , it can be shown that in this case the canonical formalism and the grand canonical formalism do not need to coincide in the thermodynamic limit . in many cases",
    "an overlap takes place between the microcanonical- and the canonical ensemble because in the latter the energy scales as the number of particles while fluctuations scale as its square root , so that the energy becomes more defined for big occupations . to check for a potential equivalence in the current case ,",
    "it is necessary to look at the fluctuations in the number of particles , which can be obtained from @xmath97 proceeding as in the previous section , it follows @xmath98 therefore , fluctuations are of the same order than @xmath90 and the number of particles remains a statistical parameter , in contrast to the case in the canonical formalism , where the number of particles is fixed .",
    "a simple many - particle model has been introduced and shown to display a qpt in accordance to canonical ensemble theory .",
    "a detailed study of the same structure with reference to the macrocanonical ensemble shows no sign of a phase transition nor a way to approach the canonical ensemble conditions .",
    "the grand canonical partition function displays a divergence with relation to the interaction parameter which follows a power law with an exponent that takes a characteristic value in a case clearly related to the critical point of the underlying qpt .",
    "the scaling properties of the grand partition function , and from it the power law exponents , were determined analytically using a mean field formulation .",
    "it is shown that the observed features affect the thermodynamic observables in a way that makes it possible to identify the critical point of the underlying qft from relations involving thermodynamic observables and hamiltonian parameters .",
    "it remains to be seen whether similar signatures are displayed by models undergoing phase transitions at finite temperature , so that a critical point is approached by shifting the temperature rather than a hamiltonian parameter . due to their similarity with hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the lmg model and its correlative",
    ", the dicke model @xcite , seem suitable scenarios to explore the thermodynamic response connected to the grand canonical formalism .",
    "evidence seems to suggest that the precursors of a qpt in the thermodynamic limit stay active , albeit to a lesser extent , in the collective response of the finite - size profile of a system .",
