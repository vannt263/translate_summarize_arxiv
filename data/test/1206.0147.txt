    "substantial progress in fabricating high-@xmath0 mechanical resonators with high frequencies , as well as recent success in cooling them close to the motional ground state @xcite , inaugurate a new research field of manifold fundamental interest @xcite .",
    "the regime of very low temperature , where a quantum mechanical description predicts only few quanta of mechanical motion , promises potential insight into some fundamental questions of decoherence , as well as various technical applications that make use the of the expected quantum behavior @xcite .",
    "fundamental questions , concerning the border between the classical ( macroscopic ) and the quantum ( microscopic ) worlds @xcite , trigger a natural interest in preparing quantum states of `` as large as possible '' objects and demonstrating their distinct quantum behavior by appropriate measurements . see @xcite for a recent review .    regarding this major goal , it is important to stress that the dynamics of a purely harmonic quantum system is analogous to its classical dynamics , in the sense that expectation values of canonical observables follow the classical equations of motion @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a common approach to introduce nonlinearities in a quantum system in order to detect quantum behavior . while there may be the possibility to achieve the strong optomechanical coupling regime @xcite and make use of the nonlinear nature of the standard optomechanical coupling , or to couple to a nonlinear ancilla system @xcite , we propose here a different approach : the use of an optoelectromechanical system featuring a tunable _ mechanical _ nonlinearity per phonon .",
    "the latter originates from the intrinsic geometric nonlinearity of elastic systems @xcite and its amount per motional quanta is enhanced with the help of electrostatic fields .",
    "this has the advantage that the linear optomechanical coupling is preserved as a control channel providing techniques as , for example , the sideband driving technique used in @xcite .",
    "the regime of large mechanical nonlinearity then enables new means to control the mechanical motion at the quantum level , if combined with the coupling to a high - q optical cavity mode , as well as the application of suitable gradient fields .",
    "the intrinsic anharmonicity in the mechanical motion of micro- and nanomechanical resonators is usually small and therefore only relevant in the regime of large oscillation amplitudes . in order to render the anharmonicity relevant for displacements at the scale of the quantum mechanical zero point motion",
    ", we propose to use electrostatic gradient forces to enhance the latter @xcite .",
    "these forces result from the dielectric properties of the resonator material when an inhomogeneous external electric field is applied .",
    "they can be used to effectively reduce the resonator s stiffness and therefore its resonance frequencies . in turn , this has the effect that the zero point deflection is enhanced up to an extent that the nonlinear contribution becomes important .    using this technique ,",
    "the nonlinearity per phonon can be made large enough , that distinct transitions in the mechanical spectrum can be resonantly addressed while interacting with other quantum systems .",
    "examples are the selective sideband driving of transitions in the mechanical spectrum @xcite , or the resonant exchange of excitations within an array of nanoresonators via a common cavity mode @xcite .    in this paper , we explicitly derive the fundamental mode properties of a nonlinear mechanical resonator , subject to the aforementioned gradient forces , to obtain a suitable model for the mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "we then derive the specifics of the optomechanical coupling to a high finesse cavity and analyze possible source of damping and decoherence in detail",
    ". we also summarize different control schemes , associated with suitable laser drives for the cavity and gradient fields from the tip electrodes .",
    "two applications of these control mechanisms have been proposed previously @xcite , considering state of the art experimental components .",
    "we finally discuss a readout scheme for the nonlinear mechanical resonators considered .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : elasticity ] we describe the nonlinear dynamics of thin rods starting from elasticity theory and derive the resulting fundamental mode hamiltonian . in section [ sec : softening ] we describe our approach to enhance the intrinsic mechanical nonlinearity by mode softening with gradient forces .",

    "we quantitatively discuss its central physical properties , namely the optomechanical coupling mechanism in section [ sec : coupling ] , as well as potential setup specific losses in section [ sec : losses ] . in section [ sec : controlmech ] we review some mechanisms that can be used to control the mechanical motion at the level of single phonons and which have been applied in previous works @xcite .",

    "the harmonic description of the transverse motion of thin rods is based on only considering the bending energy for small deflections @xcite .",
    "we consider here thin rods , which means that the cross - sectional dimensions , such as the radius for circular cross sections or width and depth for rectangular cross sections , are much smaller than the length @xmath1 .",

    "we quantize this model by introducing bosonic mode operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 , given by @xmath46 where we introduced the zero point motion amplitudes @xmath47 for each mode .",

    "however , the later is found to be negligible for the parameters considered ( see appendix [ appendix b ] ) and the shift of the fundamental mode can be ignored given the additional tunable electrostatic contribution ( see section [ sec : softening ] ) .",

    ", the frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 refer to fundamental mode properties that result only from the intrinsic elastic forces in the absence of any externally applied forces on the rod .",
    "as we will describe in the next section , external forces can be used to tune the resonance frequency , @xmath63 , which will in turn change the zero point motion amplitude , @xmath64 , and hence the nonlinearity , @xmath65 .",
    "in this section we describe how electric fields generated by tip electrodes that are placed near the center of the doubly clamped nanobeam , see figure [ fig : bending_fig2 ] , can be employed to control its dynamical properties . in particular ,",

    "one way to change the mode frequency that has been discussed previously , is to add an additional external force along the rod axis , that causes compressive or tensile strain @xcite .",

    "the electrostatic potential associated to @xmath86 in turn is an inverted harmonic potential that lowers the harmonic oscillation frequency of the nanobeam .",

    "<S> we present a scheme for tuning and controlling nanomechanical resonators by subjecting them to electrostatic gradient fields , provided by nearby tip electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this approach enables access to a novel regime of optomechanics , where the intrinsic nonlinearity of the nanoresonator can be explored . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> one or several laser driven cavity modes coupled to the nanoresonator and suitably adjusted gradient fields allow to control the motional state of the nanoresonator at the single phonon level . some applications of this platform have been presented previously @xcite . here , we provide a detailed description of the corresponding setup and its optomechanical coupling mechanisms , together with an in - depth analysis of possible sources of damping or decoherence and a discussion of the readout of the nanoresonator state . </S>"
