    "g009.62 + 00.20 is a star - forming complex located at a parallax distance of 5.2  kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "its radio continuum source `` e '' , named by @xcite , is the most compact component among a number of  regions detected in the field , which align along a ridge of 0.5  pc in size ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "close to g009.62 + 00.20e , the presence of an embedded , massive , young stellar object ( yso ) , is inferred through interferometric observations of high - excitation ch@xmath0cn and ch@xmath0oh lines , typical hot molecular core tracers , and continuum dust emission at 2.7  mm @xcite .",
    "source e has not been detected at near - infrared @xcite or mid - infrared @xcite wavelengths , which argues for an early stage of stellar evolution .",
    "its continuum emission at 1.3  cm is unresolved with a beam size of about @xmath2 @xcite , which sets an upper limit to the physical extent of the  emission of @xmath3  pc .    in proximity of source e ,",
    "it is observed several class   ch@xmath0oh maser transitions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including the strongest maser emission at 6.7ghz observed in the galaxy ( 5000 - 6000jy , @xcite ) , together with h@xmath1o @xcite , ground state oh @xcite , and a rare maser action in the nh@xmath0(5,5 ) inversion line @xcite",
    ". an interesting characteristic of this object is the periodic variability of its class   ch@xmath0oh masers @xcite , with a cycle of 244 days over the 10 years monitoring performed so far @xcite .    in order to explain this intriguing behavior ,",
    "it is crucial to image both the maser distribution and the  region morphology with high accuracy . for this purpose",
    ", we have performed astrometric observations toward g009.62 + 00.20 of the 6.7  ghz ch@xmath0oh , 1.665 and 1.667  ghz oh , and 22.2  ghz h@xmath1o masers with the australian long baseline array ( lba ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) . very long",
    "baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations were performed in phase - referencing mode for the primary goal of absolute position calibration at milliarcsecond accuracy .",
    "we also conducted karlg.janskyverylargearray ( jvla ) observations in the most extended configuration at q band , in order to accurately locate the  region with respect to the maser species and determine its brightness distribution .",
    "we employed the vlba to observe the @xmath4 h@xmath1o maser transition ( at 22.235079  ghz ) and both main - line @xmath5 @xmath6 oh maser transitions ( at 1.665401  ghz and 1.667359  ghz ) . the lba was used to observe the @xmath7 ch@xmath0oh maser transition ( at 6.668519  ghz ) . at l ( 1.5ghz ) and c ( 6ghz ) band , we observed in dual circular polarization employing two different frequency setups for continuum and line measurements .",
    "the continuum calibrators were observed using a low number of spectral channels distributed over a wide bandwidth of 16  mhz and 32  mhz for l and c band , respectively .",
    "each maser transition was recorded with a 2  mhz wide band with 2048 spectral channels .",
    "the receiver setup for the k ( 22ghz ) band observations is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "doppler tracking was performed assuming an lsr velocity of @xmath8  kms@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "observations and source information are summarized in table  [ obstab ] .",
    "the k band observations were carried out with three geodetic - like blocks placed throughout an 8  hr track , in order to measure and remove atmospheric delays for each antenna @xcite . the h@xmath1o maser emission was observed together with two extragalactic continuum sources : a strong qso , j1753@xmath101843 , from the vcs4 catalog which has an absolute position accuracy of @xmath11  mas @xcite , and a weaker qso , j1803@xmath102030 , which was previously employed in u band observations of the @xmath12e ch@xmath0oh maser emission at 12.2  ghz @xcite , whose position is accurate to only a few tens of mas .",
    "j1753@xmath101843 has an angular offset from the target maser of @xmath13 and was included in both k and l band observations , whereas j1803@xmath102030 is offset by @xmath14 and was included in both k and c band runs .",
    "the vlba and lba data were processed with the difx software correlator @xcite by using an averaging time of about 0.5  s for the k band dataset and 2  s for both l and c band data .",
    "data were reduced with the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "amplitude calibration should be accurate to better than @xmath15 .",
    "for the vlba antennas , it was obtained by continuous monitoring of the system temperatures . for the lba , we made use of a template spectrum extracted from the parkes data , in order to calibrate the autocorrelation spectra of the remaining antennas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "* exp.code at219 ) . in figure  [ spots",
    "] , we registered the peak positions of the three datasets taking into account the proper motion of the star - forming region @xcite .",

    "source e splits in two sub - components , which hereafter we refer to as e1 ( southwestern ) and e2 ( northeastern ) .",
    "e1 is five times stronger and offset by about 250  mas ( 1300  au ) from e2 .",
    "the flux density measured in the b configuration is consistent with that ( @xmath19  mjy ) reported by @xcite in c configuration , which suggests we recovered all the significant flux around component e.    oh masers have peak brightness temperatures between @xmath20 and @xmath21  k and are found further from both radio continuum peaks than the other masers .",
    "individual spots are slightly resolved with an upper limit in size of @xmath22 cm .",
    "the spot size was obtained by gaussian deconvolution with the beam .",
    "oh maser cloudlets have fwhm linewidths determined by gaussian fitting in the range @xmath23  kms@xmath9 . only fits with fwhm estimated with less than a @xmath15 uncertainty were considered .",

    "individual spots are slightly resolved with an upper limit in size of @xmath25  cm and arise in four distinct loci along the n - s direction ( @xmath26  mas ) .",
    "water maser cloudlets have linewidths between @xmath27  kms@xmath9  and emit over a v@xmath28 range of about 13  kms@xmath9 , including the most redshifted masing gas from the region at @xmath29  kms@xmath9 .    all the methanol maser emission , except one faint feature ,",
    "is projected within about 600  au from the peak of component e1 and spans more than three orders of magnitudes in brightness temperature , from @xmath30 to @xmath31  k. individual ch@xmath0oh cloudlets are grouped in two n - s filamentary structures to the east and west of the radio continuum peak e1 ( figure  [ spots ] ) and cover a line - of - sight velocity range of 8  kms@xmath9 .",
    "emission from the strongest maser spots appears resolved in a core / halo morphology , as it is evidenced in figure  [ mapsum ] .",
    "linewidths range between 0.17 and 0.36  kms@xmath9 .",
    "emission from the western filament is limited to negative lsr velocities , blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the region , and its peak brightness temperature is less than @xmath21  k. the eastern filament includes the strongest , galactic , 6.7  ghz ch@xmath0oh maser feature , which is placed at zero offset in figure  [ spots ] .",
    "its isotropic luminosity of @xmath32  l@xmath33 arises from a cloudlet with an apparent size of @xmath34au .",
    "our observing epoch falls in the quiescent period between the 13th and 14th flare cycles on the basis of the ephemeris provided by @xcite .",
    "therefore , both values of brightness temperature and isotropic luminosity have to be taken as lower limits .",
    "we note a quasi - elliptical distribution of ch@xmath0oh maser emission which occurs within 150  au to the south of the brightest maser feature ( figure  [ mapsum ] ) .",
    "this emission is clearly detected within a v@xmath28 range of 0.5  kms@xmath9 , at redshifted velocities with respect to the brightest maser .",
    "the ellipse is best fitted by a major axis of 31mas , a minor axis of 13mas , and a position angle of @xmath35 .",
    "if the apparent ellipticity were a projection of a circular ring in keplerian rotation , viewed from an angle of @xmath36 from edge - on , the @xmath37  kms@xmath9  variation over a 16mas radius would correspond to a central mass of @xmath38 .",
    "the central mass estimated from keplerian rotation is about eight times that of jupiter , which rules out a possible stellar system inside the ring .",
    "the long - term monitoring performed with the hartrao telescope by ( * ? ? ? * their table  2 ) has set strong constraints on the periodic activity of the ch@xmath0oh masers in g009.62 + 00.20e . at 12.2  ghz",
    ", the periodic flaring has been detected at lsr velocities of 1.25 , 1.64 , and 2.12  kms@xmath9 . at 6.7  ghz ,",
    "the same flaring profile and recurrence are observed at 1.23 , 1.84 , 2.24 , and 3.03  kms@xmath9 . in figure  [ spots ] , we superpose the 12.2  ghz maser distribution by @xcite with that at 6.7  ghz , by aligning the strongest maser features in both transitions .",
    "this alignment provides an optimal match between similar groups of features at 12.2 and 6.7  ghz , which also show lsr velocities in agreement within about 0.1  kms@xmath9 .",
    "this evidence suggests that both maser lines arise from the same cloudlets . on the basis of vlba observations of the 12.2  ghz maser emission during a flare",
    ", @xcite constrained the peak position of the flaring activity to within a few tens of mas from the strongest maser feature ( at the origin of figure  [ spots ] ) .",
    "no significant flaring delays are detected among the 12.2  ghz features and between features at similar velocity in both maser transitions @xcite .",
    "after each flare event , the periodic masers decrease to the same brightness level they had before the flare , on a time scale of a few months .",
    "as mapped with the lba ( table  [ masertab ] ) , a number of 6.7ghz maser cloudlets emit within the velocity range of the variable peak emission in the single - dish hartrao spectra .",
    "this may suggest that the variable emission arises from a combination of different , bright , maser cloudlets , as well as possible extended emission resolved out on the long baselines .",
    "these cloudlets should have peak velocities within a maser linewidth from the variable single - dish peaks , in order to contribute significantly to the emission . by selecting these maser cloudlets in table  [ masertab ]",
    ", we can confidently confine the region of periodic ch@xmath0oh emission , including 12.2ghz masers ( @xcite , their animated figure6 ) , inside the solid box in figure  [ spots ] .    in recent years",
    ", three possible scenarios have been proposed to explain the periodic variability observed toward a number of class   ch@xmath0oh maser sources @xcite .",
    "the most recent one invokes stellar pulsation by a ob - type yso in a pre zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) phase , under the assumption of accretion rates on the order of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this scenario does not apply to strong , photoionized , radio continuum sources as the model requires effective protostellar temperatures on the order of 5000  k. two other models invoke the presence of a binary system of ob - type stars , which eventually provides the periodic modulation of either 1 ) the radiation field that is amplified by the maser @xcite , or 2 ) the ir radiation field that cause the population inversion of the maser levels @xcite .",
    "model 1 ) requires the masing region amplifying a continuum emission in the background , which is periodically enhanced by a colliding - wind binary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  1 ) .",
    "model 2 ) predicts the presence of a circumbinary disk which periodically accretes material onto a binary system , following simulations by @xcite , and periodically heats up a dusty envelope increasing the ir radiation field ( see also a similar model by @xcite ) .",
    "currently , we can not rule out a periodic variation of the radio continuum emission amplified by the maser cloudlets .",
    "if the source of input signal to the maser were coincident with component e1 , which is projected against the region of maser variability , maser cloudlets with different lsr velocities than the variable masers would likely lie further away from e1 . otherwise , we make use of the yso multiplicity , evidenced by the 7 mm continuum peaks , and the presence of high accretions rates ( @xmath40 ) recently detected toward g009.62 + 00.20e by @xcite , to suggest that the maser variability may be explained by the superposition of two , independent , ir sources , which provide the pumping mechanism for class   ch@xmath0oh masers @xcite . first , a constant ir radiation field provided by the warm dusty envelope associated with the radio continuum source e1 ( figure  [ maserandradio ] ) . this environment would sustain the population inversion of the ch@xmath0oh maser levels over the whole region and cause the maser emission during the quiescent flaring period .",
    "second , an ir radiation field periodically enhanced by a growing massive yso in the vicinity of the eastern ch@xmath0oh maser distribution , following the model by @xcite .",
    "this object can not be the main cause of radio continuum emission in the region .",
    "instead , we consider an object associated with the faint radio component e2 , which lies ( in projection ) close to ( @xmath41au ) the peak of the ch@xmath0oh periodic activity .",
    "to test this hypothesis , we compare the number of photons emitted by a warm dust layer surrounding source e1 , with those provided by the photosphere of a bloated protostar at the position of e2 . assuming saturated masers ,",
    "since the ch@xmath0oh maser features increase by a factor up to 3 during the flaring period @xcite , these two sources of ir photons should be comparable .",
    "we consider a dust temperature on the order of 150  k @xcite , consistent with the rotational temperature measured in the region from ch@xmath0cn and h@xmath1cs molecules @xcite . for a frequency of about 13.5thz ,",
    "corresponding to the excitation of the upward links which pump the 12.2ghz masers @xcite , we obtain a number of emitted photons per unit time and area ( n@xmath42 ) of @xmath43 .",
    "we can parameterize the number of photons which effectively reaches a masing cloudlet , as a function of the relative distance of the the dust layer ( r@xmath42 ) and the cloudlet ( r@xmath44 ) with respect to the exciting yso , @xmath45 .",
    "we then consider a secondary , variable , source of ir photons provided by a bloated protostar which pulsates at the period of the maser flares .",
    "following eq.(3 ) of @xcite , this object would attain a protostellar radius of about 600r@xmath33 , and a protostellar luminosity consistent with the iras fluxes measured in the region ( e.g. , table1 of @xcite ) .",
    "such a protostar , with an effective temperature of 5000k , would provide a number of 13.5thz photons ( n@xmath46 ) of @xmath47 at the position of the periodic masers ( box in figure  [ spots ] ) . providing that the maser is saturated , we can reason on the position of the bloated protostar with respect to the masing gas .",
    "assuming the bloated protostar at the position of e2 , the two pumping sources would be comparable if the masing cloudlets are observed in the foreground with respect to the warm dust layer ( e.g. , r@xmath48 ) .",
    "otherwise , the protostar should lie closer to ( @xmath49au ) the region of periodic variability for r@xmath50 .",
    "a critical test for the presence of a pulsating protostar in the vicinity of the radio component e2 , may be provided by the eastern cluster of oh masers at a v@xmath28 of 1.65  kms@xmath9  ( figure  [ maserandradio ] ) . since oh masers",
    "are radiatively pumped by an ir radiation field similar to the one exciting the class   ch@xmath0oh masers @xcite , oh maser features close to the source of ir radiation may be subject to a similar periodic flaring as well , which would rule out model 1 ) .",
