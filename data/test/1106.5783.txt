    "typical light - atoms scattering processes including rayleigh scattering , compton scattering , raman scattering , as well as the cycle of absorbing and emitting photons by atoms are all corresponding to certain feynman diagrams in the perturbation theory of bound - state qed .",
    "the inner bound electron lines in such feynman diagrams are described by the feynman propagators , which can give the off - shell amplitudes of photons in atoms phenomenally .",
    "such propagators have superluminal but causal property , which connects the superluminal propagation of a light pulse in atomic media .    in the bound - state qed ,",
    "the energy levels of the atoms are determined by the potential @xmath20 , which is composed of the coulomb potential , the finite size potential from nuclei , or other potentials from other electrons in the atom @xcite . the value of the feynman propagators in eq .",

    "( [ pp ] ) are also determined by the value of @xmath20 .",
    "although the superluminal property of these feynman propagators can be found without integrating them in position space , we hope future study with suitable @xmath20 may give more precise integrated results of the feynman propagators of bound - electrons",
    ". these results will give the precise description of photon s propagating in atoms .    the widely used light - atom interaction model in quantum optics",
    "can be considered as the electric dipole approximation of the bound - state qed , and is suitable to deal with the time - differential processes , while the perturbation theory of bound - state qed with s - matrix formalism @xmath119 is more suitable to study the time - integrating processes , such as photon - atom scattering . however , the electric dipole approximation restricts the widely used light - atom interaction model in quantum optics from studying the atoms interacting with short - wavelength light .",
    "the perturbation theory of bound - state qed is always valid due to it can be applied to the interaction between atoms and light at all wavelengths .",
