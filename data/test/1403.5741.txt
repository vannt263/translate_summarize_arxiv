    "the sheaf - theoretical approach is hardly avoidable when one wants to deal with singular generalizations of manifolds ( varieties or schemes for instance ) , or with  non - reduced situations \" , such as supermanifolds , where the rings of  functions \" have nilpotents . in this last example",

    "infinite - dimensional manifolds , whether locally modeled on banach spaces , frchet spaces or general locally convex spaces , have almost always been defined in terms of charts and atlases .",
    "one reason for that is the belief , following the thesis of douady @xcite , that the sheaf of scalar - valued functions does not give sufficient information to define the morphisms ( contrary to the finite - dimensional case , where defining the smooth functions valued in @xmath4 suffices to determine the morphisms valued in @xmath5 for every natural number @xmath6 ) . in @xcite",
    ", mazet defines a category of infinite - dimensional analytic spaces , precisely in terms of ringed spaces .",
    "however , his category leads to pathologies ( such as the sum of two analytic maps not necessarily being analytic ) .",
    "douady avoids these pathologies by introducing a third approach for capturing the notion of space , which he uses to define his category of banach analytic spaces .",

    ", one associates a sheaf of sets @xmath13 ( thought of as the sheaf of @xmath12-valued morphisms on @xmath10 ) .",

    "+ the functored space approach obviously adds a supplementary  technical layer \" , which can be felt already when defining the local models for banach analytic spaces ( as functored spaces ) . thus ,",
    "unless the recourse to functored spaces is absolutely necessary , it is preferable to deal with the more traditional setting of ringed spaces , i.e. to associate only a single structure sheaf instead of a sheaf - valued functor to each space .",
    "we are thus lead to the question whether the insufficiency of the sheaf of scalar - valued functions pointed out by douady ( and the related pathologies ) appears also in the non - singular setting of infinite - dimensional smooth manifolds .",
    "+ in this paper , we address this question by observing that the obstruction to define infinite - dimensional manifolds as ringed spaces boils down to the failure of a _ scalarwise smooth _ map between open sets of locally convex spaces to be smooth . more precisely , given two locally convex spaces @xmath14 and @xmath12 , and given an open subset @xmath15 of @xmath14 , we adopt a standard notion of smoothness for maps @xmath16 ( _ cf . _ definition [ bhmn ] ) , following bastiani , hamilton , milnor , neeb , ... then , a map @xmath17 is said to be _ scalarwise smooth _ if the function @xmath18 is smooth for every smooth function @xmath19 .",

    "+    let @xmath252 be a class of l.c",
    ". models . for every structure",
    "functor - smooth @xmath252-manifold @xmath387 , there is a canonical maximal atlas @xmath264 on @xmath255 such that @xmath269 is a smooth @xmath252-manifold , and @xmath388 .",
    "* proof  :* mutatis mutandis the proof of corollary [ manifolds = structure sheaf - smooth manifolds ] shows this corollary as well .",
    "@xmath44 + one could also take @xmath252 to be the class of all complex locally convex spaces .",
    "the notion of smooth @xmath252-manifold is then replaced by that of _ complex - analytic locally convex manifold_. to such a manifold @xmath269 , one can then associate a _ complex - analytic locally convex manifold in the structure - sheaf sense _ @xmath389 , where @xmath390 is the sheaf of complex - analytic functions on @xmath1 .",
    "one has then the following result .",
    "+    let @xmath269 and @xmath274 be complex - analytic locally convex manifolds , and @xmath275 a continuous map .",
    "then @xmath17 is complex - analytic if and only if @xmath391 is a morphism of locally ringed spaces .",
    "+    * proof  :* by the chain rule , analytic maps are morphisms of locally ringed spaces .",
    "assume now that @xmath17 is a morphism of locally ringed spaces .",
    "since the condition of analyticity is local , we can proceed as in the proof of theorem [ smooth equals ringed morphism ] , which amounts to replace @xmath255 and @xmath370 by open subsets @xmath392 and @xmath393 of complex locally convex spaces @xmath14 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "this gives a map @xmath394 which is scalarwise analytic .",
    "in particular , viewed as a map from @xmath392 to @xmath12 , @xmath329 is weakly analytic . by @xcite ( part ii , proposition 1.6 )",
    ", we deduce that @xmath329 is analytic .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 itself is analytic .",
    "@xmath44 +    if , instead of complex - analytic locally convex manifolds , one considers more generally complex - analytic subsets of locally convex spaces ( and analytic spaces modelled on such analytic sets ) , then pathologies appear .",
    "there are examples of reduced analytic sets ( in the ringed space - sense ) with continuous maps into some complex banach space which are weakly analytic but not analytic ( see e.g. @xcite , pp .",
    "73 - 80 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is avoided by defining analytic sets and spaces as functored spaces in @xcite .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we give a simple proof of the fact that the mackey - closure topology on a frchet space coincides with the given topology .",
    "+      * proof  :* we know that the @xmath120-topology is finer than the given topology . we need to show that conversely , any @xmath120-open subset of @xmath14 is open .",
    "let @xmath15 be an absolutely convex @xmath120-neighborhood of 0 .",
    "first we show that being @xmath120-open , @xmath15 must absorb every bounded set .",
    "+ suppose that there exists a bounded set @xmath31 which is not absorbed by @xmath15 .",
    "then for every @xmath395 , we have that @xmath31 is not contained in @xmath396 . in particular , if we consider a sequence @xmath60 of positive real numbers converging to 0 , then for every @xmath0 , the set @xmath31 is not contained in @xmath397 .",
    "so for every @xmath0 , we can choose @xmath398 such that @xmath399 .",
    "now @xmath400 for every @xmath0 , therefore the sequence @xmath401 mackey - converges to 0 .",
    "since @xmath15 is @xmath120-open , this implies the existence of @xmath402 such that @xmath403 . on the other hand , since @xmath404 , there exists @xmath405 such that @xmath406 . for @xmath407",
    ", we have @xmath408 , and so @xmath409 , contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath15 absorbs every bounded set .",

    "let @xmath410 be a decreasing countable basis of neighborhoods of 0 in @xmath14 .",
    "we may assume each @xmath411 to be balanced , in which case @xmath412 is also a basis of neighborhoods of 0 . since @xmath15 is not a neighborhood of 0 , for every @xmath0 , the basic neighborhood @xmath413 is not contained in @xmath15 . for each @xmath0",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath416 , and so the set @xmath417 is bounded . by what we have seen above , @xmath15 will absorb this set , and so there exists @xmath395 such that @xmath418 for all @xmath0 . for @xmath0",
