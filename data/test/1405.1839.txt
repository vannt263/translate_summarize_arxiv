    "since the first planet outside the solar system was discovered orbiting the millisecond pulsar psr1257 + 12 ( @xcite ) , the study of extra - solar planets has rapidly become one of the key research areas in astronomy today . at the time of writing",
    ", 1782 exoplanets have been identified through many different techniques including radial velocity measurements , gravitational microlensing , transit surveys and many others . as of writing",
    ", 1133 are known to be transiting , mostly discovered by transit surveys such as superwasp ( @xcite ) , corot ( @xcite ) , the hatnet project ( @xcite ) and kepler ( @xcite ) .",
    "transiting systems provide a radius , and hence bulk density when coupled with the planetary mass determined from radial velocity follow - up , as well as characterising their atmospheres with techniques such as transmission spectroscopy ( @xcite , @xcite ) and secondary eclipse photometry ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk density is an important parameter to determine , as this value is used in chemical composition models and atmospheric simulations .",
    "the bulk density is measured by determining the radius of the planet from the transit lightcurve , and assuming a spherical planet in order to work out the volume . since the volume and mass of the planet",
    "are then both known , a simple bulk density calculation can be applied .",
    "previous work on modelling exoplanet distortion has been carried out by @xcite , who demonstrated that tidal and rotational forces result in a systematic underestimation of the planetary radius .",
    "the tidal distortion is particularly relevant for short period planets with low masses and large radii , as these systems are subject to a significant amount of gravitational interaction with the host star .",
    "since the bulk of the distortion would lie along the axis connecting the star and planet , this effect would not be apparent during transit observations  where the planet will appear largely spherical due to the observer being presented with a smaller cross - sectional area during transit .",
    "failing to account for this distortion would therefore result in a systematic overestimation of the measured densities of exoplanets , since the volume is calculated based on the planet being spherical . since a significant proportion ( @xmath030% ) of exoplanets",
    "so far discovered have orbital separations of @xmath10.1a.u .",
    "( @xcite ) , this could potentially affect the measured bulk densities of a number of hot - jupiter systems .",
    "indeed , work by @xcite and @xcite show that distortion in wasp-12b is appreciable , and can potentially impact on mass - loss rates for short - period systems . naturally , if the tidal forces are weak , the distortion will be negligible , and the planet remains close to spherical .",
    "while @xcite are able to calculate the distorted shapes of exoplanets , which has important implications for our understanding of the internal dynamics of short period systems , their approach is limited in that the models are difficult to reconcile with observational parameters .",
    "for example , the work of @xcite requires detailed internal structure models , incorporating effects such as rotation and atmospheric structure .",
    "these parameters are obtained from models derived from measurements of jupiter and saturn .",
    "since our solar system s gas giants have markedly different rotation periods , orbital separations and incident fluxes to those of the short - period hot - jupiters , accurate determination of such internal parameters for hot - jupiters is fraught with uncertainty and potential error , as well as being beyond the expertise of the average observer .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the fact that , to the best of our knowledge , the important work by @xcite has never been applied to determine planetary density corrections in any observational exoplanet characterisation publication ( though it has been used to indicate the importance of tidal distortion effects e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim , therefore , was to outline a much simpler model to estimate planetary distortion , which would be easier to implement and would be comparable to the more detailed simulations of @xcite in order to make the models as applicable to observers as possible , the main focus of the modelling was to estimate the distortion using observed parameters gleaned from transit photometry and rv measurements .    in this paper , we model the gravitational interaction between the parent star and planet using the roche approximation , and show that tidal distortion can be significant for hot - jupiters with orbital periods less than @xmath02 days . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the method of constructing a distorted hot - jupiter and measuring the volume in order to work out the change in bulk density , and use this model in section 3 to estimate the distortion of hot - saturn - like planets . in section 4",
    ", we use the parameters of the shortest - period systems , derived from follow - up photometry and radial - velocity measurements , to calculate the tidal distortion of these exoplanets , and discuss the significance of these findings , comparing the results with the simulations by @xcite",
    "in order to model the exoplanets tidally distorted surface , we have assumed that it lies along a surface of constant gravitational potential . under the roche approximation ( @xcite ) , the total gravitational potential ( @xmath2 ) at any point within the system",
    "is given by ;",
    "@xmath3^{1/2}}\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2[(x-{\\mu}a)^2+y^2 ] , \\label{eqn : phi } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    ( e.g. @xcite ) where @xmath4 is the mass of the primary component ( in this case the host star ) and @xmath5 is the mass of the secondary ( in this case the exoplanet ) .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are co - ordinates in which the surface is plotted with the origin at the centre - of - mass of the primary component , where @xmath6 is along the line - of - centre , @xmath7 is along the orbital plane and @xmath8 makes a right - handed set .",
    "@xmath9 is the orbital separation between the centres - of - mass of the two components . @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( the angular velocity of the system ) , where @xmath12 is the orbital period .",
    "the roche approximation has widely been used to model interacting binary systems , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "for example , roche tomography ( for a description , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) uses the roche approximation in order to reconstruct the surface features of secondaries for a number of cv systems from the velocity profiles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "given the extreme tidal forces acting on some short period hot - jupiters , it was decided to model their shapes using the roche approximation .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it is possible to obtain the distortion solely from the observed system parameters as opposed to methods which use parameters derived from simulations , such as planetary rotation and internal structure .",
    "we note here that the roche approximation has previously been used by @xcite to estimate the reflection effect for tidally distorted planets , but density corrections were not calculated for these systems .    in order to measure the distortion of the planet using the roche approximation ,",
    "a number of assumptions have been made .",
    "first , we have assumed the planet is tidally locked with the star , so the orbital period is equal to the rotation period .",
    "we also assume the orbit has been circularised , so as to keep the distortion over the orbital period constant .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as it follows predictions of hot - jupiter formation and follow - up work ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is also a requirement of equation [ eqn : phi ] .",
    "we have also assumed that the mass of the planet is centrally condensed , again , required by equation [ eqn : phi ] .",
    "this was also an assumption made by @xcite and , for example , simulations by @xcite predict a centrally condensed wasp-12b given an orbital eccentricity of @xmath00 .    in order to match the model to the observed radius ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 in equation  [ eqn : phi ] was adjusted such that the projected area of the model planet during transit matched those given by observations .",
    "this method gives the quantity ( @xmath13/@xmath14)@xmath15 , the ratio of the planetary occulting area to projected star area .",
    "since this is equivalent to the actual parameter derived from the transit light curve , this was determined to be the best method in which to set the value of @xmath13 , as opposed to just setting the value of @xmath2 to return the corresponding polar radius .",
    "the three - dimensional output is given in figure [ roche ] , along with the spherical case using the parameters of wasp-19 , a planetary system with one of the shortest known orbital periods ( 0.79 days ) .",
    "figure [ zerophase ] shows the sky - projected surface area of wasp-19b for both the spherical and distorted case at phase 0 . as can be seen from the projections , the polar radius at zero phase is almost identical",
    "this is due to the bulk of the distortion being projected away from the observer , towards the star , making the planet appear spherical in both cases .",
    "since the precise co - ordinates of the tiles were known , the volume of each ` slice ' of elements was determined by finding the area bounding the surface of the tile with the centre of the slice .",
    "the area was then multiplied by the depth of each slice , effectively modelling it as a tapered wedge .",
    "the number of tiles were set sufficiently high to make the gaps between sequential tile areas negligible , but also sufficiently low to avoid truncation issues when working out the projected area .",
    "to check there were no jumps in the projected area due to the tile projections , the density of the planet was calculated as a function of orbital period .",
    "figure [ track ] is an example of this process using the system parameters of wasp-19b .",
    "this allowed for the internal consistency of the code to be tested by setting the orbital period of the system to a value where one would expect the distortion to be negligible , and hence the planet to be spherical . at around 10 days , the difference between the volume given by the spherical case and the volume output from the simulations was @xmath00.001% for wasp-19b . once the accuracy and consistency of the code had been thoroughly established and tile truncation and placement errors had been minimised , the parameters of thirty - four short - period hot - jupiters were obtained in order to model the tidal distortion for each of these systems .",
    "we discuss the impact of this in section [ results ] .",
    "as a final demonstration , a number of cases of exoplanets with parameters similar to saturn have been modelled with the orbital period set to one day , the results of which are summarised in table [ tab : simulations of saturn - like planets ] .",
    "this was carried out in order to investigate the region of planetary parameters , primarily star - to - planet mass ratio , which are most susceptible to a severe ( i.e. @xmath1620% ) level of distortion . a 1@xmath17 model and 0.3 @xmath17 ( saturn - like ) model",
    "have been added as a comparison .",
    "we have also run the simulations over a range of orbital periods .",
    "the results from these simulations indicate that for saturn - mass planets , the density correction is significantly important for orbital periods of less than @xmath01.5 days . for a hot - saturn with an orbital period of 0.6 days ,",
    "the density correction approaches 25% , sufficient to alter the position of the exoplanet on the mass - radius relation ( see figure [ fig : massrad ] ) .",
    "whilst there has yet to be a candidate discovered matching these orbital parameters , many systems are being identified with densities matching that of saturn with short orbital periods ( e.g @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that a density correction of @xmath05 - 10% is being approached for systems with more massive host stars , for orbital periods of 1 day .",
    "whist systems matching these exact parameters have yet to be discovered , hot - jupiters with orbital periods of less than one day are known to exist ( e.g. wasp-18b , wasp-19b , corot-7b , kepler-10b , kepler-70b ) .",
    "the parameters we have used for these simulations provide an initial , if somewhat speculative , investigation into planets which could potentially show extreme levels of distortion . in the case of gj163b",
    " a non - transiting exoplanet  we have simply used the mass ratio of the system with a saturn - like radius , as the radius of the planet can not be constrained from radial velocity measurements .",
    "an especially interesting case is that of hd149026b . since its discovery in 2005 , the incredibly high density ( 1.17g@xmath18 ) has resulted in the prediction of an anomalously high core mass of 70 - 85@xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous predictions of planetary formation using the core accretion model indicate a maximum core mass of 30@xmath19 before runaway gas accretion occurs ( @xcite ) .",
    "several explanations for the massive core of hd149026b have been proposed , including heavy element rain onto the core , accretion of planetesimals and collisions between planetary embryos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the gravitational distortion of this planet with its current orbital period of 2.8 days is insufficient to lower its density in order to reduce the core mass to levels that agree with accretion theory , gravitational distortion could allow this for shorter period systems , should they be observed .",
    "for example , a saturn - mass planet in a 1 day orbit around a 1.1@xmath20 star would yield a radius of 0.7@xmath21 if sphericity was assumed , but would actually have a mean radius closer to 0.8@xmath21 due to gravitational distortion . using the evolutionary models of @xcite in addition to the core mass values calculated by @xcite with our new density value would allow a more accurate core mass to be estimated for such systems . for the case above , assuming a spherical planet ( i.e. a radius of 0.7@xmath21 ) , the core mass would be calculated to be 85@xmath19 assuming a core density of 5.5g@xmath18 , and a core mass of @xmath2274@xmath19 assuming a core density of 10.5g@xmath18 ( the core density of saturn ) . the value of our density correction , however , would result in a corrected estimate of the core mass of @xmath2274@xmath19 assuming a core density of 5.5g@xmath18 , and a core mass of @xmath2260@xmath19 assuming a core density of 10.5g@xmath18 for the distorted case .",
    "this reduction in the core mass of a planet analogous to hd149026b on a sufficiently short - period indicates that hot - saturns discovered to have a higher than expected core mass can be partially explained by the tidal distortion effect .",
    "additional mechanisms , such as accretion of planetesimals , can then be invoked to explain this much more easily with a reduced core mass .",
    ".output from simulations using the mass - ratios of three exoplanet systems , hd149026 , wasp-29 and gj163 , using a 1 day orbital period .",
    "also included as a comparison are the cases for a jupiter - mass planet and a saturn - mass planet orbiting a 1@xmath20 star with a period of 1 day .",
    "the density values have been indicated for both the spherical ( 6 ) and distorted cases ( 7 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these planets have an appreciable eccentricity , with hat - p-23 having @xmath23=0.106 , and gj436 having @xmath23=0.15 , and therefore do not strictly satisfy the condition of orbital circularisation assumed by equation [ eqn : phi ] . +    [ 1 ] @xcite [ 2 ] @xcite [ 3 ] @xcite [ 4 ] @xcite [ 5 ] @xcite [ 6 ] @xcite [ 7 ] @xcite [ 8 ] @xcite [ 9 ] @xcite [ 10 ] @xcite [ 11 ] @xcite [ 12 ] @xcite [ 13 ] @xcite [ 14 ] @xcite [ 15 ] @xcite [ 16 ] @xcite [ 17 ] @xcite [ 18 ] @xcite [ 19 ] @xcite [ 20 ] @xcite [ 21 ] @xcite [ 22 ] @xcite [ 23 ] @xcite [ 24 ] @xcite [ 25 ] @xcite [ 26 ] @xcite [ 27 ] @xcite [ 28 ] @xcite +"
