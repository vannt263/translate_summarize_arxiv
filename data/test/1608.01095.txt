    "hadronic structure and their properties , being nonperturbative in nature , are difficult to understand from the first principle of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the last decade ,",
    "there have been numerous attempts to gain insight into the hadronic structure by studying the qcd inspired models @xcite .",
    "the quark - diquark model @xcite is one of the most successful qcd inspired models to investigate various aspects of hardonic properties where the nucleon is considered to be a bound state of a single quark and a scalar or vector diquark state .",
    "recently , a light - front scalar quark - diquark model for the nucleons inspired by soft - wall ads / qcd has been proposed @xcite and extensively used to investigate and reproduce many interesting properties of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "the light - front wave functions ( lfwfs ) in this model are obtained by matching the electromagnetic form factors of the hadrons in the soft - wall model of ads / qcd which has been successful in explaining various hadronic properties , for example , hadron mass spectrum , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , meson and nucleon form factors , transverse densities , structure functions etc . @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between the string theories of gravity in the ads space and conformal gauge field theories in the physical space - time provides a completely new set of tool for studying the dynamics of qcd .",
    "one can represent the strong interactions of quarks and gluons by a semi - classical gravity theory i.e. , without quantum effects such as particle creation and annihilation in higher dimensions .",
    "even though , a perfect string theory dual of qcd is not yet known , the ads / cft correspondence can still provide remarkable insight into various properties / features of qcd including color confinement , qualitative explanation for meson and baryon spectra and wave functions describing the hadron structure .",
    "qcd is conformal in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region , whereas , in the infrared ( ir ) region , the confining gauge theory with a mass gap is characterized by the scale @xmath2 and a well defined spectrum of hadronic states .",
    "light - front holography represents a remarkable connection between the ads space and the light - front framework where the wave amplitude propagating in the ads space is mapped into the light - front wave functions of hadrons in space - time in terms of a light - front transverse variable @xmath3 ( giving the separation of the quarks and gluonic constituents within the hadron ) @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors , probed through elastic scattering , contain information about the internal structure of the nucleons .",
    "a fourier transformation of these form factors provides information about the spatial distributions of charge .",
    "the well known examples include the charge and magnetization distributions inside the nucleons .",
    "one can obtain the dirac ( charge ) and pauli ( magnetic ) form factors from the overlap of the lfwfs by calculating the matrix element of electromagnetic current @xmath4 in the light - front frame @xcite .",
    "in such a frame , the momentum transfer is the conjugate variable of the impact - parameter and via fourier transform with respect to the momentum transfer in transverse direction , the form factors reflect the charge distributions of quarks in the impact - parameter space @xcite .",
    "the charge distributions in the transverse coordinate space obtained form the overlap of lfwfs in coordinate space have been studied @xcite and a comparison of charge distributions in transverse impact - parameter space in different ads / qcd models has been reported in refs .",

    "the gravitational form factors related to the energy momentum tensor @xmath5 also play an important role in the understanding of hadronic physics .",
    "they have been studied in both the light - cone and the ads / qcd framework and can also be obtained from the second moments of gpds @xcite . the gravitational form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be obtained from helicity non - flip and helicity flip matrix elements of the @xmath8 tensor current similar to the dirac @xmath9 and pauli @xmath10 form factors respectively .",
    "the transverse spin sum rule and gravitational form factors have been studied @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the gravitational form factor @xmath6 in the impact - parameter space has an interesting interpretation @xcite as it gives the longitudinal momentum density ( @xmath11 density ) in the transverse impact - parameter space .",
    "a comparative study of longitudinal momentum densities in transverse impact - parameter space in two different soft - wall ads / qcd models has been carried out @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the charge distributions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks in transverse coordinate space in a light - front quark - diquark model for the nucleons using the overlaps of the wave functions constructed from the soft - wall ads / qcd prediction . </S>",
