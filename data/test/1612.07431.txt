    "high precision doppler spectroscopy is an important tool to investigate many astrophysical processes in the universe .",
    "measurement of tiny doppler shifts from radial velocity ( rv ) can provide insight about the stellar interior ; reveal the existence of unseen planets around other stars ; help us probe the variability of fundamental constants of nature and provide useful information of binary and pulsating stars @xcite .",
    "in particular , the radial velocity technique has been immensely successful in detecting hundreds of planets with different mass range and orbital periods @xcite . the main challenge and focus of contemporary research",
    "is to find earth - analogs within the habitable zone of star where life sustaining conditions could prevail .",
    "recently , the doppler data from eso s two precision rv instruments , namely harps and uves , was decisive in unveiling the presence of 1.3 earth - mass rocky planet orbiting proxima centauri - the nearest known star to the sun @xcite .",
    "typically , doppler precision of @xmath3 cms@xmath2 or better is required to address many compelling science cases including the detection of terrestrial - size planets around sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "leading rv observing campaigns are carried out with state - of - the - art echelle spectrograph , carefully designed and built to operate under tightly regulated thermovac conditions @xcite .",
    "a high resolution spectrum of star in visible / nir band is recorded on a 2d array of ccd pixels . to extract the rv signal from time series data , spectrograph is wavelength calibrated with a laboratory source of well known emission or absorption lines . in calibration process several lines of known wavelengths are identified and a quadratic or high order polynomial fit is used to invert the pixel coordinates into accurate wavelength units .",
    "two commonly used wavelength reference in astronomy are thorium - argon ( th - ar ) emission lamp and iodine absorption cell @xcite . despite averaging the shift over thousands of spectral lines , the best rv precision obtained from these sources is limited to @xmath4  ms@xmath2 .",
    "the rv uncertainty of traditional sources arises from wavelength inaccuracies of individual lines , spectral contamination , aging of the lamp , limited spectral coverage , line blending effects , uneven distribution and varying intensity of lines across spectrograph band @xcite .",
    "an ideal calibrator choice for enabling sub - ms@xmath2 rv precision in next generation spectrographs is a broadband laser frequency comb ( lfc ) .",
    "the lfc consists of thousands of equispaced lines produced from a femtosecond mode - locked laser @xcite .",
    "the entire comb spectrum is stabilized by anchoring to atomic clock with well established radio - frequency locking technique . since past decade different versions of lfcs",
    "have been tested and validated @xcite .",
    "new developments are still awaited to overcome a couple of technical and operational difficulties .",
    "it might take a while for lfc to become a simple and affordable turn - key instrument for routine wavelength calibration at most observatories .",
    "a simple and cost effective approach to produce reference spectra is to use cavity resonance lines of a fp etalon @xcite .",
    "a plane parallel fp cavity when illuminated with a broadband white light source acts as a periodic wavelength filter .",
    "the transmitted light consists of evenly distributed lines that result from multiple beam interference inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "the cavity lines are separated by free spectra range @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the light speed and @xmath7 is the cavity length .",
    "many variants of fps ( e.g. solid , air spaced and fiber based ) have been successfully built and tested for astronomy calibration @xcite .",
    "the positional accuracy of fp lines critically depends on stability of the cavity itself .",
    "any noise affecting the cavity length would randomly displace the resonant lines thus directly impairing the achievable rv precision .",
    "the impact of temperature and pressure fluctuations on the cavity length is generally eliminated by mounting the fp inside a thermally controlled evacuated chamber which is capable of achieving @xmath8  1 ms  @xmath2 short - term stability @xcite .",
    "a passively stabilized fp apparatus producing reference spectra has no built  in mechanism to track systematic offsets or drifts in cavity length occurring over time scales of weeks , months or even years .",
    "regardless of good passive isolation , cavity drift could still occur from temperature residuals , material aging or changes in optical properties of the coatings @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity @xmath9 and the fractional length and frequency stability of the cavity can be expressed as @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , a 1  nm change in a 1  cm long cavity corresponds to @xmath855  mhz frequency shift of cavity lines in visible ( @xmath11 nm ) region , which amounts to 30  ms@xmath2 rv uncertainty . to reach a rv precision @xmath12 cms@xmath2 , the cavity length should be stable to @xmath13 level or better",
    ".    for long - term usability ( several months to years ) of astro - fp , research efforts are now being directed at controlling and tracking the time dependent cavity drift with advance techniques @xcite .",
    "measurement of tiny dimensional changes in cavity length calls for advanced metrology based on laser frequency standards . a drift tracking or active length - control",
    "requires cavity - locking to a frequency stabilized diode laser or vice - versa @xcite . in cavity - lock setup",
    ", the frequency stability of the laser is expected to be transferred to the stability of the fp cavity lines .",
    "the main task of frequency or phase locking mechanism is to keep cavity transmission point in resonance with frequency of the laser @xcite .    a short - length , low - finesse(@xmath14 ) cavity , while useful for generating broadband reference lines for astronomy spectrographs , is not ideal for laser metrology .",
    "normally , a robust laser - lock requires a sharp discriminant signal which depends on the laser power and the cavity linewidth @xcite .",
    "the linewidth @xmath15 of the cavity should be sufficiently narrow to produce a steeper error signal .",
    "the inverse dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath16 on the linewidth @xmath17 implies a clear advantage of longer and high finesse cavities .",
    "another practical difficultly of utilizing astro - fp in laser applications is the cavity geometry .",
    "a confocal cavity design is more appropriate for locking purpose because it greatly simplifies beam alignment and mode - matching conditions for single frequency laser beam . on the contrary , a collimated white light beam",
    "is easily coupled into a short - length planar cavity producing reference spectra @xcite .",
    "these considerations show incompatible requirements of a cavity for laser metrology and astronomy calibration .",
    "clearly , a single fp cavity is inadequate for serving dual purpose of ` _ _ wavelength calibration _ _ ' on one hand and ` _ _ drift tracking _ _ ' on other .",
    "we propose to circumvent this problem by constructing two adjoining cavities of equal length but of different finesse on a single block of ultra low expansion ( ule ) glass . the low finesse _",
    "astro - cavity _ would produce the calibration spectra while the high finesse _ lock - cavity _ would facilitate frequency locking to implement stability tracking mechanism .",
    "the length of two cavities is defined by the length of monolithic spacer block . here",
    ", the implicit assumption is that external perturbations , if any , act uniformly on the entire fp block , thus causing equal and identical length changes in both cavities .",
    "in fact , drift measurements would only be accurate so long the relative length variation between two cavities is well below @xmath18 . under this premise alone the _ lock - cavity _ would function as a reliable proxy for measuring the stability of the _ astro - cavity_. departure from this scenario would result in intractable measurement errors .",

    "these studies are important to understand the level of performance one can realistically expect to achieve in the proposed device .",

    "are selected based on spectrograph requirements .",
    "the cavity spacing @xmath7 is chosen so that reference lines are easily resolved by spectrograph in the detector plane .",
    "generally , a short cavity ( e.g. , @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 ghz ) is required to generate optimally spaced comb lines to calibrate a high resolution ( @xmath26 ) astronomy spectrograph .",
    "the reflectivity ( @xmath27 ) of broadband coated mirrors yields a low finesse @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting cavity linewidth @xmath29 is such that it is optimally sampled by the detector pixels . to produce reference lines that are 15 ghz apart",
    "would require a planar cavity of length 1  cm .",
    "the main component of the proposed device is a two - channel fp etalon .",
    "it consists of two cylindrical cavities of diameter 12  mm each , bored adjacent to each other on a rectangular block ( @xmath30 mm@xmath31 ) of ultra low expansion ( ule ) glass .",
    "the cavity mirrors are made of fused silica ( fs ) and optically contacted on either side of the spacer block .",
    "we assume the optical contacts to be sufficiently strong and free from any imperfections .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption as the modern techniques of joining optical elements have become more robust @xcite . a cad geometry of the device is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the low - finesse _ astro - cavity _ ( fp1 ) is to provide astronomy calibration lines and high - finesse _ lock - cavity _ ( fp2 ) is to provide a light channel for robust laser - lock .",
    "the cavity length @xmath32=1  cm is chosen to produce 15  ghz apart reference lines to calibrate a typical high resolution ( 100,000 ) echelle spectrographs . to maintain sufficient rigidity of the entire structure ,",
    "a small 5  mm gap is provided on all sides between mirrors and spacer edges .",

    "the rf electronics following the photodiode ( pd ) provides necessary feedback to keep one of the sideband frequencies , e.g. @xmath33 ( shown in red ) , locked to the peak of cavity transmission line ( shown in blue ) . for clarity ,",
    "other ancillary components are not shown . ]",
    "the conceptual principle of dual fp cavity - lock is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . the cavity drift can be tracked in several ways , but often requires two lasers @xcite .",
    "however , the same goal can be accomplished using a simpler approach of _ sideband locking _ which needs only one laser @xcite . in this method",
    "the frequency @xmath34 of the laser is pre - stabilized to rb - cell using standard saturation absorption @xcite . a tunable electro - optic modulator ( eom )",
    "creates radio frequency ( rf ) sidebands @xmath35 around the central frequency @xmath34 of the laser .",
    "one of the sidebands is then locked to the nearest resonance peak of fp2 cavity using modified pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) method .",
    "the rf frequency @xmath36 of the oscillator driving eom is servo - locked to cavity .",
    "this technique preserves the intrinsic stability of main laser beam @xmath34 that is locked to rubidium while exploiting the sideband tunability to track the cavity drift .    to estimate the drift , the frequency of the radio oscillator has to be readout independently by a frequency counter or rf spectrum analyzer .",
    "a fractional length change ( @xmath37 ) about @xmath18 of the cavity block corresponds to rv error of 10  cms@xmath2 or a rf frequency shift of few hz in an eom operating at 1  ghz . measuring a ghz rf signal with an accuracy of few hz ( amounting to few ppb frequency resolution )",
    "is a challenging task .",
    "however , the desired precision can be reached with many cycles of repeated measurements .",
    "alternatively , optical - beat measurement with two lasers yields much better sensitivity when the cavity is used in reflection mode , i.e. pdh locking @xcite .",
    "for example , a fractional change @xmath18 of the cavity length would induce a readily measurable frequency excursion of @xmath38  khz in the optical - beat signal obtained with pdh setup using 780 nm laser .",
    "the exact implementation details will be worked out in a separate study .",
    "the resonance stability of fp cavity is determined by the stability of optical length between each mirror pairs .",
    "different noise sources e.g. , seismic and acoustic vibrations , material inhomogeneities , fluctuations in temperature , pressure and refractive index of the air etc influence the cavity stability .",
    "the impact of pressure on refractive index fluctuations is largely eliminated by placing the cavity inside a vacuum tank .",
    "a properly designed vacuum system also attenuates acoustic noise .",
    "our focus in this study is on temperature and vibration perturbations which affect the long- and short - term stability of the fabry - perot cavity . to achieve a desired tracking accuracy the length changes @xmath39 in astro - cavity fp1",
    "must strongly correlate with the length changes @xmath40 in lock - cavity fp2 . how well @xmath39 and @xmath40 correlate would largely depends on cavity geometry and the way noise is transmitted into the experiment . normally , the thermal and acoustic noise couples into cavity through mounting and support system .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to estimate noise levels for which the differential length change in two cavities , @xmath41 becomes significant . in other words ,",
    "when @xmath42 , the change in rf lock - point of fp2 would accurately reflect the length changes in fp1 .",
    "uncorrelated cavity deformations would render the laser - lock technique ineffective .",
    "the shape of an elastic body can deform under the application of a force that may arise from constant acceleration ( e.g. gravity loading ) , floor - vibrations , shocks or acoustic pickup . in most cases ,",
    "acceleration experienced by a cavity is in the form of vibration perturbations .",
    "these perturbations are time - dependent and contain a large range of frequencies that excite various mechanical eigenmodes of the cavity .",
    "the exact nature of interaction depends on wavelength of excitation relative to the physical size of the cavity @xcite .",
    "in high - frequency limit ( small wavelength ) , a full dynamic analysis is needed to obtain a complete information of local strain and displacement of the cavity points .",
    "since the excitation wavelengths at higher frequencies are significantly smaller than the cavity size , the conventional numerical discretization methods for dynamic analysis are inefficient and require significant computer resources .",
    "though from practical viewpoint , the high frequency vibrations are less of a problem . they can be effectively attenuated in lab using vibration isolation tables , suitable damping materials , soft cushioning and multi - stage suspension .    in low - frequency limit ( @xmath43 hz )",
    "the dynamic problem of cavity deformation can be reduced to static analysis @xcite . in this regime",
    "the excitation wavelength become longer than the cavity size and all points in the cavity respond to the applied force in unison manner .",
    "the low - frequency collective motions ( compression or stretching ) of the particles can be approximated by quasi - static equilibrium resulting from application of a static force or a constant acceleration .",
    "traditionally , the vibration or acceleration sensitivity of a cavity is expressed in normalized units of acceleration due to gravity @xmath44  [ ms@xmath45 . in this work",
    "we also follow the same convention .",

    "sometimes further simplifications are made by developing a reduced set of field equations solely in terms of stresses or displacements .",
    "one such formulism is to eliminate stresses and strains from eqs.(1)-(3 ) and express the displacement in a simplified form , known as navier s equation .",

    "5(c ) ) the sheared strain in fp is produced in such a way that fp1 cavity mirrors are deflected inward [ outward ] and fp2 cavity mirrors are deflected outward [ inward ] .",
    "such response can be attributed to unequal shear strain produced because of the constrained boundary and geometrical asymmetry of the cavity in @xmath83-direction . a significant differential length change ( @xmath108pm )",
    "occurs due to shortening of one cavity and elongation of the other .",
    "this amounts to spurious rv tracking errors about 140 cms@xmath2@xmath109 or equivalently a frequency shift of 1.8 mhz@xmath109 at 782 nm laser . *",

    "]    v    from the proceeding analysis we conclude that proposed fp device is immune to differential length changes if the acceleration noise is oriented along the cavity length and in the vertical direction .",
    "however , the noise coupling in @xmath83-direction can induced non - zero differential length changes ( @xmath114 ) between two cavities . in such case",
    ", the instantaneous drift measured by laser - lock setup will not be same as the drift of astro - cavity . based on the type of noise",
    "some strategies can be adopted to overcome this limitation .",
    "for example , a typical noise spikes ( an impulse excitation ) only lasts for a fraction of second and temporarily deforms the elastic cavity to produce uncorrelated tracking error in drift measurement .",
    "after the noise pulse has elapsed the elastic cavity would return to its original shape and laser - lock would resume the correct measurements . in such case ,",
    "the actual drift has to be estimated from a series of measurements by carefully discarding the erroneous data .",
    "if the source of noise is constant then setup has to be properly shielded .",
    "for example , the measurement error due to differential length changes in the proposed device can be reduced below cms@xmath2 level by attenuating the noise by @xmath115 .",
