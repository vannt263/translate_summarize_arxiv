    "fluids close to their glass transitions exhibit very large relaxation times , as well as characteristic fluctuations such as intermittent molecular motion and dynamical heterogeneity  @xcite . a central question in these systems",
    "is how these dynamical observations can be related to the packing of molecules in space ( the liquid structure ) .",
    "possibilities include a link via the diversity of possible packings ( the configurational entropy )  @xcite , or via a few privileged structural motifs  @xcite , or via the emergence of some mobile ` excitations ' which are sufficient to determine the dynamical behaviour  @xcite .",
    "however , finding meaningful correlations between liquid structure and dynamics is challenging , both in simulations and experiments , and demonstrating causal links between structure and dynamics is harder still .",
    "recently , this question has been addressed by the procedure of ` random pinning '  @xcite .",
    "a subset of particles is chosen at random and their positions are fixed ( quenched ) for all future times . by observing the motion of the remaining particles in this disordered environment , one aims to elucidate the relationships between structure and dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the prediction of random first order transition ( rfot ) theory  @xcite is that the pinning procedure reduces the configurational entropy , eventually resulting in an ideal glass transition at some special concentration of frozen particles , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that the transition is accompanied by diverging structural and dynamical length scales that are closely related to each other .",
    "if confirmed , these predictions would be strong evidence in favour of rfot theory .",
    "recent simulations have provided evidence in favour of a transition at @xmath0  @xcite , based on monte carlo methods that focus on ` static ' properties of the system ( that is , properties of the boltzmann distribution , without reference to dynamical motion ) .",
    "calculations within mode coupling theory also indicate the existence of a transition at some @xmath0 , although the properties of this transition are not yet fully resolved  @xcite    in this work , we present measurements of dynamical correlations in the presence of random pinning . compared with  @xcite",
    ", we use fairly large systems ( @xmath1 particles ) , in order to resolve the real - space behaviour of dynamical ( four - point ) correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "the pinning procedure acts to slow down the dynamical relaxation of the system  this limits the ranges of pinning and temperature that we can consider for these system sizes .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence of an increasing dynamical length scale as random pinning is increased .",
    "thus , the relaxation time in these systems increases strongly with pinning , at fixed temperature , without any evidence of increased dynamical heterogeneity or co - operativity .",
    "of course , these observations do not rule out the possibility of large static / dynamical length scales at lower temperature or with more pinning , as predicted by rfot .",
    "on the other hand , we discuss a simpler theoretical picture based on an inhomogeneous dynamical arrest , which is sufficient to explain the observations presented here .",
    "we present the models and correlation functions that we will use in sec .",

    "it contains two species of particles , a ( larger ) and b ( smaller ) , in a cubic box of size @xmath2 , with periodic boundaries .",

    "we consider a system of @xmath5 particles , which is large enough to obtain bulk behaviour for the temperatures shown .",
    "the density is @xmath6 as in  @xcite .",
    "the system evolves by the monte carlo ( mc ) dynamical scheme described in  @xcite , which gives behaviour consistent with overdamped langevin dynamics . for the time scales associated with structural relaxation , this mc scheme also gives results that are in quantitative agreement with molecular dynamics .",
    "the natural time unit is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( bare ) diffusion constant of a free particle .",
    "we use the same simulation time step as in @xcite , so that the time interval @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath10 mc sweeps . in our numerical results we set @xmath11 , which fixes the unit of time .    as in  @xcite",
    ", we will consider systems where some particles are pinned in fixed positions , while all other particles are free to move as usual . to achieve this ,",
    "we take an initial configuration and freeze each particle with probability @xmath12 , independently . hence , the number of pinned ( frozen ) particles @xmath13 is binomially distributed with mean @xmath14 , while the number of unpinned ( mobile ) particles @xmath15 has mean @xmath16 .      when random pinning is present , it is important to focus on `` collective '' overlap functions that depend on density profiles but not on particle identities . to facilitate this ,",

    "our correlation functions focus on particles of type a , but we emphasize that when randomly pinning particles , we treat types a and b equally . to measure static correlations associated with liquid structure , we define @xmath30 by translational invariance , @xmath31 depends only on the relative position of cells @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore denote the spherical average of this function simply by @xmath33 .",
    "this @xmath33 mirrors the behaviour of the familiar radial distribution function of the fluid .",

    "both @xmath78 and @xmath70 show the usual peak near the structural relaxation time . however , since the time - dependent normalisation factor in ( [ equ : def - chin ] ) decreases with time , the peak in @xmath70 occurs at a later time than the peak in @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig : t045-g4](a ) shows @xmath43 , together with its long time limit @xmath51 .",

    "there is some structure in @xmath81 on short length scales that mirrors the oscillations in @xmath33 , but the behavior on longer length scales is well - described by a single exponential . by fitting this exponential decay , we can therefore estimate the length scale associated with four - point correlations as @xmath82 , broadly consistent with earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath83 as @xmath84 in the absence of pinning , and this measurement is based on subtracting the long time limit of @xmath43 from its value at time @xmath48 .",
    "this procedure yields a function that is ( roughly ) monotonic , which aids fitting ; it is made possible by the ` collective ' four point functions considered here .",
    "it is more common to consider four - point functions based on ` self'-correlation functions for which the long time limit of @xmath43 is hard to estimate numerically , making it difficult to define an appropriate analog for @xmath81 .",
    "the single exponential decay in @xmath85 is expected if the dynamical heterogeneities are clusters of mobile / immobile particles that are ` compact ' : that is , their ` fractal dimension ' appears to be close to three , equal to the spatial dimension  @xcite .",
    "other fits , for example to the ornstein - zernicke form @xmath86 , are also possible  @xcite , but the single exponential shown does give a strikingly good fit .",
    "the presence of a single exponential also leads to a contribution to the four - point structure factor  @xcite given ( for small-@xmath87)by @xmath88 .",
    "[ here @xmath89 is simply the ( three - dimensional ) fourier transform of @xmath43 .",

    "we also note that while @xmath78 depends on the choice of ensemble used in computer simulations  @xcite the function @xmath43 depends on the choice of ensemble only through finite - size corrections at @xmath90 . [",
    "these corrections do not decay with @xmath44 and therefore yield a finite contribution after the sum in ( [ fig : t045-g4 ] ) , resulting in an ensemble - dependent @xmath78 . ] further , the energy is free to fluctuate in our mc simulations , which helps to minimise finite - size corrections to @xmath91 .",
    "when we introduce random pinning then the number of pinned particles is also free to fluctuate , again minimising these finite - size corrections .",
    "some further discussion of this point is given in the appendix .",
    "we now turn to the main question of this article : how does the presence of pinned particles affect the dynamical relaxation of the system . figs .  [",
    "fig : dyn ] and [ fig : g4 ] show results obtained at temperatures @xmath92 and @xmath93 using the pinning protocol of  @xcite . that is , starting from an equilibrium configuration , each particle is pinned with probability @xmath12 , independently of other particles .",
    "the pinning takes place at time @xmath42 and we measure correlation functions between this time and @xmath48 . as before ,",
    "the ensemble is time - translation invariant so we suppress the dependence of correlation functions on @xmath49 , for compactness of notation .    figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn](a , c ) show that the relaxation time increases by up to two orders of magnitude for the ranges of @xmath12 shown . in the presence of pinning",
    ", the shape of the function @xmath77 also appears more ` stretched ' ( non - exponential ) , indicating the presence of a broad range of time scales .",
    "the presence of a clear plateau in @xmath77 indicates that the system is behaving in a glassy fashion , and one expects co - operative and heterogeneous dynamics to be taking place .",
    "however , the large time scales encountered on pinning limit the range of temperature and @xmath12 considered : these are temperatures at which the system is moderately supercooled and @xmath12 is small enough that the long time limit of @xmath77 is closer to zero than it is to the plateau .",
    "the key result of figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn](b , d ) is that the peak of the normalised susceptibility @xmath70 increases slightly for small @xmath12 but quickly saturates at a value that is almost independent of @xmath12 . in all cases , @xmath70 continues to show a clear peak as a function of time : we note that for larger @xmath12 when the system does not decorrelate significantly even as @xmath84 , we expect @xmath70 to become monotonic , with a large-@xmath48 limit whose value indicates the heterogeneity of the response to pinning .",
    "however , we do not observe this effect , since increasing @xmath12 further makes the dynamics very slow , and prevents sampling in the long - time limit .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : g4 ] , we show @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the time at which @xmath70 is maximal .",
    "the data show clearly that there is no significant change in the four - point correlation length @xmath94 , as pinning is increased .",
    "we again emphasise that @xmath43 is a dimensionless function of order unity , so that both the strength of the correlations and their range have direct physical interpretation .",
    "hence the fact that @xmath68 changes little as @xmath95 is increased is indicating that the dynamical heterogeneity responds weakly to pinning .",
    "since @xmath96 is obtained by a spatial integral of @xmath97 $ ] , the weak dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath95 in fig .  [ fig : dyn](b , d ) is directly attributable to the weak dependence of the dynamical heterogeneities on @xmath95 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : chin - all ] , we combine the various measurements of @xmath70 , evaluating them at @xmath69 for the various state points considered .",
    "it is clear that if we compare state points according to their relaxation times , then @xmath96 depends strongly on the temperature , but weakly on the concentration of pinned particles .",

    "however , in contrast to the transparent relation between @xmath70 and @xmath94 , the increasing values of these alternative susceptibilities do not appear to be directly attributable to increasing length scales . in the remainder of this article",
    ", we discuss the numerical results of figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn]-[fig : chin - all ] in the light of the theory of random pinning and of the glass transition .",
    "the recent interest in effects of random pinning on glassy systems have focussed on the proposal  @xcite that an ideal glass transition should occur on pinning , at some @xmath98 .",
    "this transition has the flavor of a critical point , in that the relaxation time diverges , as do length scales ( including @xmath94 ) and susceptibilities ( like @xmath59 ) .",
    "both random first - order transition ( rfot ) theory and mode coupling theory ( mct ) make predictions that indicate how these quantities should increase with @xmath95  @xcite . at low temperatures and relatively small @xmath95 ( not too close to @xmath98 ) ,",
    "one expects ( from mct ) a power - law relationship between @xmath59 and the relaxation time @xmath99 .",
    "this power law then crosses over to a weaker ( logarithmic ) dependence ( from rfot ) as the critical @xmath98 is approached . on the other hand , at higher temperatures",
    ", there is no transition at any @xmath0 .",
    "the highest temperature for which the transition exists is called @xmath100  @xcite , where one expects ( within mct ) a logarithmic dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath99  @xcite .    for the state points considered here",
    ", we have found that the relaxation time increases strongly , without the increases in @xmath94 or @xmath59 that are predicted by rfot / mct .",
    "one would expect even a relatively weak logarithmic dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath99 to be apparent as an increase in fig .",
    "[ fig : chin - all ]",
    ". however , there is no direct contradiction between our results and the predictions of  @xcite , since the temperatures considered here are not very low , and the values of @xmath12 not very large ( in particular , one may have @xmath101 ) .",
    "one might find an increasing susceptibility ( and length scale ) at lower temperature or larger @xmath95 .",
    "however , we have not found any concrete evidence in favour of a random pinning glass transition in these dynamical measurements .    ,",
    "plotted against the times @xmath69 at which these maximal values occur .",

    "should be obtained by choosing a region in the system of size @xmath107 , and pinning all particles outside that region , as well as the pinned particles already contained inside the region . for small @xmath107 ,",
    "the remaining mobile particles are unable to relax and the system can access only a single state , while for large @xmath107 , particles inside the cavity are unaffected by the frozen particles outside , so the system can access many states .",
    "the point - to - set length is ( loosely speaking ) the value of @xmath107 that marks the boundary between the single - state and the many - state regimes . structural relaxation in the system requires correlated motion on a scale at least as big as @xmath108 , so one expects @xmath109 in general .",
    "thus , the four - point lengths estimated here represent upper bounds on @xmath108 , indicating that it has not grown above @xmath110 for the range of @xmath12 considered .",
    "if @xmath108 grows strongly with @xmath12 as @xmath0 is approached , one should observe a rapid increase in @xmath94 and @xmath96 as @xmath95 approaches @xmath0 .    since we have not found direct evidence in favour of this rfot scenario , it is useful to consider an alternative picture of the response to pinning",
    ". clearly , pinning particles in the system reduces the available motion of the remaining particles , and acts to slow down structural relaxation .",
    "further , the existence of dynamical heterogeneity in the system indicates that the response of dynamical properties to pinning should also be heterogeneous .",
    "for example , if a certain region of the system has a relatively low propensity for motion  @xcite , one can expect that a relatively low number of pinned particles should be sufficient to prevent relaxation in that region . on the other hand ,",
    "regions with higher propensity will be less affected by pinning .",
    "if one simply assumes that these regions are independent , the result is a smooth crossover from relaxational behaviour at small @xmath12 to arrested behavior at larger @xmath12 , and no increase in @xmath96 would be observed .",
    "( this assumes that the dynamical length scale measured by @xmath96 is similar to that associated with high / low propensity regions , consistent with  @xcite . )",
    "we emphasise that this picture of different regions of the system responding almost independently to pinning is an opposite extreme to the mean - field treatment of rfot , where correlations between well - separated regions of the system appear , as in classical phase transitions .",
    "the question of whether neighbouring regions are coupled seems to be the crucial one in evaluating how systems respond to pinning .",
    "the picture of weakly - correlated domains described here is consistent with our results and it is also broadly consistent with the behaviour in the spin model considered in  @xcite .",
    "there is a mild increase in @xmath96 with @xmath12 in that system , presumably due to weak correlations between different regions , as they respond to the pinning .",
    "however , the idea of weakly - correlated domains in supercooled liquids appears to be at odds with recent results  @xcite showing that systems of up to 128 particles respond to pinning by a sharp transition from a fluid to an arrested state .",
    "this result is in accordance with the predictions of rfot .",
    "however , it would also be consistent with the weakly - correlated domain picture if the size of the relevant domains were comparable with the size of the system considered .",

    "we do not find any evidence for an increasing dynamic length scale , despite the significant increases in relaxation time .",
