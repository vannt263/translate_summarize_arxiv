    "many properties of nuclei can be understood within the independent particle model ( ipm ) . in the ipm the nucleus",
    "is considered to be a system of nucleons moving without residual interaction in a mean field or single - particle potential .",
    "the single - particle potential is either adjusted in a phenomenological way ( assuming e.g. a woods - saxon shape ) or evaluated from empirical effective interactions like the skyrme forces within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "attempts to employ realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , which reproduce the nn scattering data , directly in such a scheme fail badly : typically one does not even obtain any binding energy in this approach . this result is due to the strong short - range and tensor components , which are typical for realistic interactions and induce corresponding nn correlations in the nuclear wave function , which can not be described by the ipm or the hartree - fock approach .",
    "various tools have been developed to account for these strong short - range correlations .",
    "these include variational calculations assuming jastrow correlation functions @xcite , the correlated basis function method ( cbf ) @xcite , the `` exponential s '' method @xcite , the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation @xcite and the self - consistent green function approach @xcite .    considerable effort has also been made to find a nuclear property which is experimentally accessible and reflects the effects of nn correlations in a clear manner .",
    "a candidate for such an observable is the momentum distribution of nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "this momentum distribution can be written as @xmath2 here @xmath3 represents the ground state of the nucleus under consideration ( with a nucleons ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a nucleon with orbital angular momentum @xmath6 , total angular momentum @xmath7 , isospin @xmath8 and momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the momentum distributions for the partial waves , @xmath10 , in eq .",

    "( [ eq : nljke ] ) then yields the square of the momentum - space wave function for this single - particle state .",
    "the contribution @xmath10 vanishes in the ipm if no state with quantum numbers @xmath14 is occupied .",
    "if correlations are present beyond the ipm approach this simple picture is no longer true and the determination of the momentum distribution @xmath15 requires both in experimental as well as theoretical studies the complete knowledge of the nucleon - hole spectral function @xmath16 for all energies @xmath17 and all sets of discrete quantum numbers @xmath14 .",
    "note that the energy variable @xmath17 in this definition of the spectral function refers to the negative excitation energy of state @xmath18 in the @xmath12 system with respect to the ground - state energy of the nucleus with @xmath19 nucleons ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectral function is experimentally accessible by analyzing nucleon knockout experiments like @xmath1 .",

    "for example , can one expect to observe effects of short - range correlations in knockout experiments with small energy transfer ?",
    "microscopic calculations of the spectral function and the momentum distribution based on realistic nuclear hamiltonians have mainly been performed for very light nuclei ( @xmath24 ) @xcite or nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "results for heavier nuclei are typically derived from investigations of nuclear matter assuming a local density approximation @xcite .",
    "recent variational calculations for @xmath0o yield the momentum distribution @xcite and the @xmath25-shell quasihole wave functions @xcite but not the complete energy dependence of the hole spectral functions .",
    "the present investigation determines the spectral function and the corresponding momentum distribution directly for finite nuclei without employing the local density approximation .",
    "calculations are performed for the nucleus @xmath0o assuming a realistic meson - exchange potential @xcite for the nn interaction .",
    "the spectral function is derived from the lehmann representation of the single - particle green function .",
    "this green function solves the dyson equation with a self - energy calculated by techniques as described in ref.@xcite . a few results concerning the spectral function for the @xmath26 partial wave",
    "have been discussed already in a brief report @xcite .",
    "special attention is paid to the effect of correlations on the spectral function at different energies .",
    "we find that clear indications of the short - range nn correlations are obtained by studying the spectral function at very negative energies , which in nucleon knockout experiments correspond to excitation energies of around 100 mev and more in the remaining nucleus .",
    "the resulting green function is also used to study the effects of correlations beyond the bhf approach on the binding energy and radius of the nuclear ground state .",
    "after this short introduction we describe the techniques used to evaluate the spectral functions and momentum distributions in section 2 .",
    "the results of our numerical studies are presented in section 3 and the final section 4 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the spectral function for the various partial waves , @xmath27 , ( see eq .",

    "this choice for the oscillator length corresponds to an oscillator energy of @xmath62 = 14 mev .",

    "one also finds that this mean value is quite independent of the partial wave considered ( see left part of fig .",

    "we will come back to a discussion of possible differences between the present calculation and studies in nuclear matter when we analyze the results for the momentum distribution below .    in order to show the importance of the continuum part of the spectral functions as compared to the quasihole contribution and to visualize the effects of correlations , we have included in tab.[tab : noc ] the particle numbers for each partial wave including the degeneracy of the states @xmath120 also separating the contributions originating from the quasihole states and those due to the continuum .    in the present approach the quasihole states , which in a hartree - fock approximation would be occupied with a probability of 1.0 , are occupied with a probability of 0.78 , 0.91 and 0.90 in the case of @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "( v ) finally , we would like to recall that partial waves with @xmath127 , which were ignored in the present study may provide a non - negligible contribution to the momentum distribution at high momenta ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : npw ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the effects of correlations which are taken into account in the present investigation beyond the bhf approximation , on the ground - state properties of @xmath0o .",
    "for that purpose tab.[tab : kol ] lists the ingredients for calculating the total energy of the ground state according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : koltun ] ) .",
    "furthermore we present results obtained for the radius of the nucleon distribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsqu ] ) ) .    as a first approximation we consider the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , which means that the self - energy of the nucleons is approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : selhf ] ) .",
    "this implies that the occupation probabilities are equal to 1 for the three hole states @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath26 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the resulting binding energy per nucleon ( -1.93 mev ) is quite small .",
    "we believe that this small binding energy is due to the use of the nuclear matter @xmath35-matrix calculated at the saturation density , which overestimates the pauli effects as compared to a bhf calculation directly for @xmath0o .",
    "the treatment of the pauli operator is improved by adding the 2p1h part ( eq . [ eq : disper1 ] ) minus the correction term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) to the self - energy , an approximation which we will call brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) in the following .",
    "note that the occupation probabilities of the bhf approach are identical to those of hf .",
    "indeed , this correction increases the calculated binding energy to -4.01 mev .",
    "this number is in reasonable agreement with self - consistent bhf calculations performed for @xmath0o using the same interaction @xcite .",
    "however , as the single - particle states of bhf are more bound than the single - particle states obtained in hf , the gain in the binding energy from hf to bhf is accompanied by a reduction of the calculated radius of the nucleon distribution .",
    "this is the well - known phenomenon of the so - called `` coester band '' in finite nuclei @xcite , which plagues microscopic attempts to calculate ground - state properties of nuclear systems already for a very long time @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the 2h1p contributions to the self - energy in the complete calculation reduces the absolute values of the quasihole energies ( compare bhf and `` total '' in tab.[tab : kol ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected from our discussion following eq .",
    "( [ eq : disper2 ] ) . despite this reduction of the quasihole energies , however ,",
    "the total binding energy is increased as compared to bhf .",
    "this increase of the binding energy is mainly due to the continuum part of the spectral function . comparing the various parts of the `` koltun sumrule '' of eq .",
    "( [ eq : koltun ] ) one finds that only 37 percent of the total energy is due to the quasihole part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : koltun ] ) . the dominating part ( 63 percent )",
    "results from the continuum part of the spectral functions although this continuum part only `` represents 11 percent of the nucleons '' ( see tab.[tab : noc ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the radius , however , is dominated by the quasihole contribution to the density . as the quasihole terms have reduced energies as compared to bhf , it is plausible that the calculated radius increases in the total calculation as compared to bhf",
    ". therefore the inclusion of 2h1p terms increases the calculated binding energy and radius , moving the results for the ground state off the coester band into the direction of the experimental data .",
    "this effect is large enough to explain the discrepancy obtained between the experimental data and the results of microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations including relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "we note that inclusion of three - body forces in variational calculations for @xmath0o also yields very good results for the binding energy @xcite .",
    "an attempt has been made to derive the spectral function and the momentum distribution from a realistic obe interaction directly for a finite nucleus without the assumption of a local density approximation .",
    "the correlations taken into account beyond the hartree - fock approximation yield a strong enhancement of the momentum distribution at high momenta . it is demonstrated that this enhancement originates from the spectral function at large negative energies and therefore should be observed in nucleon knockout reactions with large energy transfer leaving the final nucleus at an excitation energy of about 100 mev .    the enhancement of the high - momentum components is weaker as obtained in studies of nuclear matter .",
    "this difference may be due to the different interactions employed ( unfortunately no nuclear matter result is available for the obe interaction used here ) or due to approximations used in the calculation for the finite system",
    ". therefore further studies of these approximations ( poor treatment of low - energy excitations , the self - energy of the nucleons is calculated in a perturbative way including terms up to second order in @xmath35 ) is required before conclusions about the validity of the local density approximation relating the results of nuclear matter to those of finite nuclei can be drawn .",
    "the resulting green function is also used to determine the total energy and the radius of the nucleon distribution .",
    "it is demonstrated that the inclusion of 2-hole 1-particle contributions to the self - energy of the nucleon yields an enhancement of the calculated binding energy per nucleon ( @xmath139 1 mev ) and an increase of the radius ( @xmath140 0.05 fm ) for @xmath0o as compared to the brueckner - hartree - fock approach .",
    "this could be sufficient to explain the discrepancy remaining between experimental data and microscopic dirac - bhf calculations @xcite .",
