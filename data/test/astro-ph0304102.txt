    "primary cosmic rays interact with nuclei in the atmosphere , and produce atmospheric secondary particles , such as muons , gamma rays and neutrinos .",
    "it is important to understand these interactions to investigate cosmic - ray phenomena inside the atmosphere . for precise study of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation  @xcite , it is crucial to reduce uncertainties in hadronic interactions , which are main sources of systematic errors in the prediction of the energy spectra of atmospheric neutrinos . at small atmospheric depths below a few ten g/@xmath0 ,",
    "production process of muons is predominant over decay process , thus we can clearly observe a feature of the hadronic interactions . in spite of their importance , only a few measurements have been performed with modest statistics because of strong constraints of short observation time of a few hours during balloon ascending periods from the ground to the balloon floating altitude .    in 2001 , using the bess spectrometer , precise measurements of the cosmic - ray fluxes and their dependence on atmospheric depth were carried out during slow descending from 4.5  g/@xmath0 to 28  g/@xmath0 for 12.4 hours .",

    "the accuracy of the efficiency for protons and helium nuclei was limited by statistics of the sample events .",

    "this requirement rejected 96.5  % of muons and positrons while keeping the efficiency for protons as high as 99.5  % .",
    "the aerogel cherenkov cut was applied below 3.7  gv , above which cherenkov output for protons begins to increase rapidly .",
    "contamination of muons in proton candidates after the aerogel cherenkov cut was estimated and subtracted by using calculated muon fluxes  @xcite , which was normalized to the observed fluxes below 1.0  gev where positive muons were clearly separated from protons .",

    "the error in this subtraction was estimated from the ambiguity in the normalization of the muon spectra to be less than 0.2  % and 0.8  % below and above 3.7  gv , respectively .    since the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity is 4.2  gv ,",
    "most of deuterons contaminating proton candidates above 4  gv are considered to be primary cosmic - ray particles .",
    "the primary @xmath20/@xmath23 ratio was estimated by our previous measurement carried out in 1998  2000 at lynn lake , manitoba , canada , where the cut - off rigidity is as low as 0.5  gv . the @xmath20/@xmath23 ratio was found to be 2  % at 3  gv .",

    "the @xmath20/@xmath23 ratio at higher energy is expected to decrease  @xcite due to the decrease in escape path lengths of primary cosmic - ray nuclei  @xcite and the deuteron component is as small as the statistical error of the proton flux .",

    "the error was estimated during the fitting procedure to be about 5  % at 0.5  gv and 0.1  % at 8.0  gv . accuracy of the electron subtraction was limited by poor statistics of electron events . for the pion contamination we made no subtraction ,",
