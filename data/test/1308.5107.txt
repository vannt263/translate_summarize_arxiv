    "currently , there is a rapidly increasing interest in the possibility to generate majorana fermions in condensed - matter systems  @xcite .",
    "this is triggered by the fact that majorana fermions exhibit non - abelian braiding properties and offer the possibility to realize topological qubits that are immune to local perturbations for quantum computing  @xcite .    by now , various theoretical proposals of how to realize majorana fermions exist , e.g. , by quasiparticles in the @xmath4 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite , as edge states of a one - dimensional wire made from a @xmath5-wave superconductor  @xcite or in vortices of a @xmath5-wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all of these proposal are very hard to realize experimentally .",
    "recently , several more feasible setups have been suggested where the surface states of a three - dimensional topological insulator or edge states of a quantum spin hall insulator are coupled to an @xmath0-wave superconductor  @xcite . in addition , it was shown that a one - dimensional @xmath5-wave superconductor can effectively be induced in a single - channel nanowire with strong spin - orbit interaction subject to an external magnetic field and in proximity with a standard @xmath0-wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions give rise to a number of characteristic transport signatures .",
    "first of all , they lead to a zero - bias peak of @xmath6 in the differential conductance of a weakly coupled normal metal probe  @xcite . in addition",
    ", majorana fermions also give rise to a fractional josephson effect where the supercurrent is @xmath1 periodic in the phase difference between the superconductors instead of being @xmath7 periodic  @xcite .",
    "the fractional josephson effect is a consequence of the crossing of andreev bound state energies as a function of the phase difference .",
    "it has by now been studied theoretically in josephson junctions where majorana fermions are realized using quantum spin hall insulator edge states  @xcite , surface states of a three - dimensional topological insulator  @xcite and nanowires  @xcite .",
    "the effects of many - channel wires  @xcite , finite wire length  @xcite and coulomb charging have been investigated  @xcite . the possibility to observe a fractional josephson effect due to landau - zener tunneling in realistic systems where imperfections in the system turn the level crossing into an avoided crossing",
    "has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "landau - zener tunneling has also been shown to yield a fractional josephson effect even in josephson junctions without majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "nanowire setups that are supposed to host majorana fermions at their ends have by now been realized by several groups  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have indeed shown zero - bias conductance peaks in agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , there exist other mechanisms like interference effects in the presence of disorder  @xcite and weak antilocalization  @xcite that can yield similar zero - bias anomalies .",
    "additionally , recent experiments have shown the occurrence of fractional shapiro steps in josephson junctions from insb nanowires  @xcite as well as unconventional behaviour of a superconductor - topological insulator josephson junction  @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest issues in clearly identifying signatures of majorana fermions is the fact that in experiments the nanowire is buried beneath a superconducting electrode .",
    "hence , its properties are not accessible to direct characterization .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by alternative setups based on quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the simplest realization of such a system consists of a double quantum dot coupled to an @xmath0-wave superconductor and subject to an inhomogenous magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the presence of majorana fermions in such a system is indicated by characteristic features in the zero - bias conductance in analogy to the majorana setups realized in nanowires .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the possibility to generate a fractional josephson effect in a setup of two double dots and analyse the robustness of the effect with respect to level detunings and coulomb interactions .",
    "compared to a conductance measurement , the josephson current offers the advantage of being a non - invasive probe as it does not require to couple any additional normal electrode to the system .    using quantum dots to investigate majorana fermions",
    "offers a number of advantages .",
    "first of all , quantum dots are well - controlled systems with parameters like level positions that can be easily tuned in experiment .",
    "in addition , very similar setups have already been realized to act as cooper pair splitter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , supercurrents through quantum dots have been observed in a number of experiments as well  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", a double quantum dot represents the shortest kitaev chain consisting of two links only .",
    "hence , it is the simplest possible majorana setup .",
    "finally , quantum dots are an ideal playground to investigate the interplay between majorana physics and strong coulomb interactions .",

    "this is in contrast to a description in the bogoliubov - de gennes picture where the excitation energies close to zero energy determine the josephson current .",
    "since the josephson current is completely determined by the spectrum of the quantum dot , in the following , we will discuss the properties of the eigenenergies rather than the josephson current itself .",
    "we are now going to discuss the eigenenergies of the quantum dot .",
    "we focus on the situation where @xmath34 .",
    "as soon as this condition is relaxed , the system will no longer exhibit a fractional josephson effect .",
    "this is in contrast to a nanowire setup where a fractional josephson effect can occur even when @xmath48 since the induced splitting of the zero - energy states is exponentially small in the length of the wire .",
    "first of all , we discuss the `` sweet spot '' in parameter space where in addition to @xmath34 we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "eigenenergies as a function of the phase difference @xmath41 .",
    "parameters are @xmath51 , @xmath49 , @xmath34 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . for each eigenenergy , there are two degenerate states with an even and odd number of electrons on the quantum dots , respectively .",
    "note that we discuss the many - body eigenenergies , i.e. , the ground state properties are determined by the state with lowest energy . ]    at the sweet spot , @xmath34 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 , analytical expressions for the eigenenergies can be obtained . however , as they are lengthy and do not provide much insight it is more convenient to discuss the eigenenergies obtained via degenerate perturbation theory in the coupling @xmath24 between the double dots .",
    "up to second order in @xmath24 , we find @xmath54 for each of these eigenenergies , there are two degenerate eigenstates with an even and odd number of electrons on the quantum dots , respectively .",
    "equivalently , for these states the nonlocal fermion @xmath55 is occupied or empty .",
    "we remark that the above expressions are only valid for @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , we instead find @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the above analytic expressions are in good agreement with the numerically obtained eigenvalues shown in even for large tunnel couplings @xmath60 .    in order to see whether a fractional josephson effect can occur in the system",
    ", we have to analyze the phase dependence of the eigenenergies @xmath61 .",
    "as shown in , the eigenenergies cross at @xmath29 , @xmath62 . due to these crossings",
    ", the system stays , e.g. , in one of the two states with energy @xmath63 when the phase difference is adiabatically increased and passes through @xmath29 .",
    "hence , increasing the phase difference by @xmath7 exchanges the ground state and the first excited state , thus leading to a @xmath1 periodic josephson current .",
    "we remark that the observation of the @xmath1 periodicity requires a conservation of fermion parity over a time scale longer than the time needed to increase the phase difference by @xmath1 .    to understand the origin of these crossings , we take a look at the majorana representation of the quantum dots , cf .",
    "for any phase difference , there are two uncoupled majorana modes at the end of the quantum dot chain .",
    "they are associated with the degeneracy of the even and odd parity states .",
    "in addition , for @xmath29 , the system hosts two chains consisting of three majorana fermions . as these chains are described by an antisymmetric @xmath64 matrix , they must have a zero - energy mode associated with the level crossing .",
    "the zero - energy modes are given by @xmath65 where the upper ( lower ) sign applies at @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the zero - energy states are localized at the ends of the three - majorana chains .",

    "we have @xmath68 , in b ) @xmath69 , in c ) @xmath70 and in d ) @xmath71 .",
    "other parameters are as in . ]",
    "so far , we considered an ideal system tuned to its sweet spot .",
    "we now analyze the influence of perturbations away from this point .",
    "we discuss both the effect of level detunings as well as of coulomb interactions .      in the following , we analyse the influence of level detunings on the occurrence of the fractional josephson effect .",
    "we first consider the detuning of the outer dot level @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as can be seen in a ) , a detuning of one of the outer dots turns the crossings between @xmath61 into anticrossings and , hence , destroys the fractional josephson effect .",
    "the reason for this becomes immediately clear when looking at the majorana representation of the quantum dots .",
    "a finite energy @xmath74 induces a coupling between the zero - energy majorana modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this coupling moves both states to finite energy and , thereby , destroys the level crossing at @xmath29 .",
    "we next turn to a detuning of the inner dot levels @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast to a detuning of the outer dot levels , we now find that the crossings are preserved and the fractional josephson effect persists , cf .",
    "this can again be understood from the majorana representation of the quantum dots .",
    "while a finite @xmath77 induces a coupling between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , it does not affect @xmath76 which therefore stays a zero - energy excitation .",
    "more generally , for a detuning of both inner dots , we find the new zero - energy majorana modes @xmath81      we next turn to the influence of coulomb interactions on the level crossings . as shown in c ) , coulomb interactions within a double quantum dot destroy the level crossings at @xmath29 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coulomb interaction induces couplings between the zero - energy modes of the unperturbed system in analogy to the detuning of the outer dot levels discussed above .",
    "in contrast , coulomb interactions @xmath82 between the double dots do not affect the occurrence of the fractional josephson effect , see d ) .",
    "this can be most easily understood by analyzing the system in the many - body picture .",
    "the eigenstates of the two uncoupled double dots are given by the product states @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 where the eigenstates of the double dots are  @xcite @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the fourfold degenerate ground states at the sweet spot are given by @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , the coulomb interaction between the double dots does not mix these states .",
    "in addition , it yields the same energy shift for all four states .",
    "hence , the level crossing at @xmath29 is conserved . as can be seen from the numerical analysis in d ) , the argument remains valid even for large coulomb interactions where lowest - order perturbation theory is no longer reliable .",

    "we demonstrate that these additional crossings give rise to a @xmath3-periodic josephson effect .",
    "we then discuss the robustness of this effect with respect to asymmetries in the systems and perturbations away from the sweet spot .",
    "the spectrum of a symmetric system @xmath57 with @xmath95 is shown in .",
    "in addition to the level crossings at @xmath29 , new crossings at @xmath28 arise , leading to eigenenergies that are @xmath3 periodic in the phase difference .",
    "we emphasize that these additional crossings are of accidential nature and not associated with majorana degrees of freedom . in order to demonstrate that the system can exhibit a @xmath3 josephson effect in the strong - coupling limit , we consider the following situation .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath104 the system has a phase difference @xmath105 and is prepared in its ground state .",
    "we then increase the phase difference with time according to @xmath98 . by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    ", we calculate the probability @xmath96 to find the system in the state with energy @xmath106 .",
    "the results shown in clearly indicate that for slow driving , the system indeed stays on one energy branch and , thus , exhibits a @xmath3-periodic josephson effect .",
    "we finally address the robustness of the additional crossings .",
    "as they are of accidential nature , any perturbation will destroy them .",
    "this prevents the occurrence of the @xmath3 josephson effect and leads to the @xmath1 effect discussed above .",
    "importantly , there is however the possibility to get at least some of the additional crossings in the presence of perturbations .",
    "first of all , additional crossings arise in a symmetric system with coulomb interaction @xmath82 between the two double dots .",
    "these give rise to @xmath2-periodic eigenenergies , cf . .",
    "furthermore , additional crossings can occur for an asymmetric system @xmath56 tuned to the sweet spot . as shown in , here again ,",
    "the additional crossings lead to the occurrence of an @xmath2 josephson effect .",
    "we investigated the josephson current through a system of two tunnel - coupled double quantum dots subject to an inhomogenous magnetic field . similarly to a majorana nanowire , the system exhibits a crossing of energy levels that gives rise to a @xmath1 josephson effect .",
    "we find this effect to be robust with respect to a detuning of the inner dot levels as well as to coulomb interactions between the double dots .",
    "in contrast , detunings of the outer dot levels and coulomb interactions within a double dot convert the crossings into anticrossing and lead to a conventional @xmath7-periodic effect .",
    "in addition , we investigated the regime of strongly couplgy double dots .",
    "we found that in this situation additional accidential level crossings can occur .",
    "for a symmetric setup , they lead to a @xmath3-periodic josephson effect whereas for an asymmetric system an @xmath2-periodic effect arises .",
    "both effects require a fine - tuning of parameters and are vulnerable to perturbations .",
    "we thank martin leijnse for reading the manuscript and useful feedback .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the swiss nsf and nccr qsit .",
    "in the following , we derive the effective dot hamiltonian  . for simplicity",
    ", we suppress the index @xmath11 characterizing the two double dots . in the limit of an infinite superconducting gap ,",
    "the superconductor s degree of freedom can be integrated out exactly to yield an effective dot hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath107 here , @xmath108 describes the relevant single level with energy @xmath109 in each quantum dot as well as the influence of an externally applied magnetic field @xmath110 acting on the dot spin @xmath111 .",
    "the effects of interdot coulomb interactions @xmath112 as well as of intradot coulomb interactions @xmath113 are described by @xmath114 tunneling between the two dots is characterized by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath115 here , we assumed that tunneling conserves the electron spin , i.e. , there is no spin - orbit interaction in the quantum dots .",
    "finally , the superconducting proximity effect on the double dot is captured by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the geometric average of the tunnel couplings between the superconductor and dot 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the first term describes a local proximity effect on a single dot whereas the second term captures the nonlocal proximity effect that involves both dots .    in the following , we focus on the situation where a large magnetic field is applied to the double dot such that for each dot",
    "only a single spin state is relevant for transport .",
    "this directly implies that double occupancy of each dot is forbidden and a local proximity effect can not occur . in the case of a homogenous magnetic field",
    ", we conclude from   that no proximity effect is possible at all since it requires the pairing of electrons with antiparallel spin .",
    "if the magnetic field is pointing in opposite directions in the two dots , we similarly conclude that no tunneling between the two double dots is possible as it conserves spin . for an arbitrary angle @xmath118 enclosed between @xmath119 and @xmath120 ,",
    "the effective tunnel coupling is given by @xmath121 while the effective strength of the proximity effect is characterized by @xmath122 .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , this tunability of the ratio between @xmath24 and @xmath123 is crucial to achieve the special point @xmath124 required for the occurrence of majorana fermions on the double dot .",
    "we thus conclude that each double quantum dot @xmath17 can be described by an effective dot hamiltonian of the form @xmath125 where we also included the dependence of the pairing term on the phase @xmath126 of the superconductor . as a final remark",
    ", we note that instead of applying an inhomogenous magnetic field we could also make use of quantum dots with spin - orbit interactions in combination with an externally applied homogenous magnetic field pointing in a different direction than the spin - orbit field .",
