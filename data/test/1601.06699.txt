    "over the last two decades , the application of ion traps has expanded from mass spectrometry  @xcite and frequency standards  @xcite towards engineering of quantum systems which can be used for quantum computation  @xcite and quantum simulation  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that large - scale trapped ion quantum information processors require micrometer - scale ion traps  @xcite .",
    "such traps usually suffer from excessive electric field noise close to metallic surfaces at room temperature , but at cryogenic temperatures this noise is strongly reduced  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems natural to move towards cryogenic experimental setups which have the additional advantage that the ambient pressure is usually a few orders of magnitude lower than at room temperature .",
    "this enables trapping of longer ion strings due to fewer collisions with background gas .",
    "furthermore , no bake - out procedure of the vacuum vessel is required , allowing for rapid trap cycle times .",
    "+ the operation of paul traps requires high radio - frequency ( rf ) voltages , which are usually generated with the aid of the voltage gain present in rf resonators . for this purpose , helical resonators",
    "are typically used in the frequency regime up to 50mhz , whereas for experiments requiring higher drive frequencies coaxial resonators have been used as well  @xcite . in cryogenic experiments ,",
    "the resonator needs to fulfill different criteria than in room temperature experiments where the resonator can be placed outside the vacuum vessel .",
    "in particular , the connections in a cryostat need to have low thermal conductivity to limit the thermal load . following the wiedemann - franz law , this results in a low electrical conductivity between room - temperature and the cryogenic parts of the experiment .",
    "thus , the resonators have to be operated at the cold - stage",
    ". moreover , space constraints are stricter in cryogenic systems which makes helical resonators undesirable as they are generally bulky . to minimize the volume of the resonator",
    ", an rlc - series - resonator can be used  @xcite .",
    "+ in section  [ sec : general considerations ] , we focus on the choice of the trap drive frequency , the required voltage gain , and voltage monitoring .",
    "section  [ sec : coil design ] covers coil design for three types of coils , and in the following section  [ sec : matching ] , we discuss impedance matching of the resonator and present an efficient way to match cryogenic resonators .",
    "section  [ sec : rf shield ] focuses on the design of rf shielding , and finally , we present the results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "in trapped ion experiments , rf - voltages of several hundreds of volts are commonly applied to the trap , which has a simple capacitor as its electrical circuit equivalent .",
    "thus , we need to design a resonator that maximizes the rf - voltage at this capacitor for a given input power . in this section , we discuss general considerations in resonator design which are not limited to a specific resonator type .      at first",
    ", we consider the losses in an rlc - resonator and its scaling with frequency . from the solution of the equation of motion of a trapped ion in a paul trap ( mathieu equation ) , one obtains the trap voltages with the stability parameter @xmath0  @xcite , which scales as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the amplitude of the rf - voltage at the trap and",
    "@xmath3 is the trap drive ( angular ) frequency .",
    "hence , for constant @xmath0 the loss power scales as @xmath4 a low trap drive frequency will reduce the losses .",
    "on the other hand , high secular motion frequencies of the ion in the trap are desirable for operation .",
    "higher secular frequencies require a higher @xmath3 , and thus the desired secular frequencies set a lower limit for @xmath3 . in this study",
    ", we aim for a @xmath0 around 0.25 , an axial secular frequency of 1mhz , and both radial frequencies to be 3.7mhz .",
    "this will require a trap drive frequency of @xmath5 42.6mhz .",
    "simulations of our trap show that we need a drive voltage of about @xmath6 to reach the desired trap frequencies . in order to limit the thermal load onto the cryostat from dissipated power in the resonator",
    ", this voltage should be reached with less than 100mw of rf  input power .",
    "this power corresponds to a consumption of about 1/7l of liquid helium per hour when operating a wet cryostat at 4.2k  @xcite .",

    "ferromagnetic core materials are undesirable , because they would induce spatial inhomogeneities of the magnetic field near the trap .",

    "kamby and coworkers  @xcite demonstrated the integration of toroidal rf - inductors into printed circuit boards ( pcb ) .",

    "@xcite provides specific formulas for the inductance @xmath41 , the resistance of one segment @xmath46 , and the resistance of one via @xmath47 of pcb coils . in order to minimize the losses of the coil we want to minimize the resistance of one winding while maintaining a constant cross - section to keep the inductance constant",
    "the resistance of one winding is defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the outer and the inner radius of the pcb coil , @xmath51 is the thickness of the pcb , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the average length - dependent resistances of a segment and a via . @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "depend on the exact geometry , but usually vias have similar cross - sections as the segments making their length - dependent resistances approximately equal .",
    "that means , in order to minimize  ( [ eq : pcb coils minimize resistance ] ) and to keep the cross section of the coil constant , @xmath54 and @xmath51 should be similar in size . + we chose rogers 4350b as the substrate material , because it has a small loss tangent , a similar thermal expansion coefficient as copper , and is ultra - high vacuum compatible .",
    "the thickest available rogers 4350b had 3.1 mm thickness , which is unfortunately too thin to minimize the resistance for a given cross - section .",
    "+        we produced this type of coil in - house and during multiple iterations , we varied the size and the number of vias .",
    "the lowest losses for our production process could be achieved with the design depicted in fig .",

    "the pcb coil has an outer diameter of 35 mm and an inner diameter 20.4 mm with a substrate thickness of 3.1 mm .",

    "we added one winding which is galvanically isolated from the rest of the coil .",
    "this winding acts as an inductive pick - up and should thus be as reproducible as the entire coil .      for the second type of coils , wire coils",
    ", we wound a single wire around a rigid structure leading to a similar geometry as the pcb coils .",
    "such a coil is less reproducible than a pcb coil since the wire length will vary for each coil .",
    "hence , its inductance and its resistance will vary as well . a coil with the same geometry as for the pcb coils above , made out of silver - plated copper on a rogers 4350b substrate ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wire coil ] .",
    "+        in wire coils , the cross - section of the core of a wire coil is bigger than that of a pcb coil , because the wire bends are less sharp .",
    "hence , we expect the inductance of a wire coil to be higher than the one of a pcb coil with the same nominal geometry .",
    "the 0.4 mm thick silver - plated copper wire , which we used for the wire coil , had a cross - section similar to the average cross - section of a pcb coil .",
    "therefore , we expect similar losses in both types of coils with the same geometries .",
    "these considerations allow us to characterize the production processes of the pcb coils by comparing the two types of coils .",
    "higher losses in the pcb coils are an indication that the production of the pcb coils can be improved .",
    "+ since we do not need traces on the substrate , it is possible use any machinable material with a low loss tangent .",
    "we also produced wire coils with a teflon core since it has a lower loss tangent and a lower dielectric constant than rogers 4350b .",
    "thus , the losses will be less affected by the core material and the self - resonance frequency of the coil will be higher .",
    "another option to minimize the losses in the coil can be to use a superconducting wire to reduce the ohmic losses of the resonator .",
    "the quality factor of the presented coils are limited by the ohmic resistance of the conductor .",
    "thus , a coil based on a superconductor is expected to result in lower losses in the resonator .",
    "furthermore , it could be necessary to operate the experiment at temperatures above 15k to reduce the liquid helium consumption in wet cryostats . at these temperatures , a superconductor with a high critical temperature such as a high temperature superconductor ( hts )",
    "is required .",
    "however , a coil made from a readily available hts material needs to be a two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure due to manufacturing constraints , and we choose to use a spiral coil as shown in fig .  [ fig : hts coil ] .",
    "+        since such coils require only 2d structuring , they can be manufactured in a very accurate and reproducible way . for the demonstrated spiral coil ,",
    "a high - temperature superconductor ( hts ) was produced by _ _",
    "ceraco ceramic coating__. our coils were made out of an yttrium barium copper oxide ( ybco ) film of 330 nm thickness on a sapphire wafer .",
    "to facilitate soldered connections , a 200 nm film of gold was placed on top of the superconductor .",
    "the critical temperature of this ybco film is above 87k , and its critical current density is higher than @xmath55a/@xmath56 at 77k .",
    "we can derive the peak current in the coil from section  [ sec : general considerations ] to be 0.64a .",
    "hence , traces with a width of more than 100@xmath45 m are required to stay below the critical current density . + for our square spiral coils , we chose a trace width of 300@xmath45 m , a trace gap of 150@xmath45 m , and 10 windings .",
    "we designed 9 different coils varying the outer diameter between 14 and 20 mm .",
    "equation 4.1 of reference  @xcite gives an estimate for the inductance , which results in target inductances between 1.2@xmath45h and 1.6@xmath45h for our coils .",
    "this design should allow for coils with very high quality factors already at temperatures accessible with liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium .",
    "+ it should be noted here that superconductors are perfect diamagnets , which are spatial inhomogeneities for magnetic fields .",
    "one can align the 2d plane of the spiral coil with the spatially homogeneous magnetic field of the experiment to minimize this effect , but one should always keep this in mind .",
    "the resonator is connected to the source through a cable with a given wave resistance @xmath16 , typically 50@xmath3 .",
    "the complex voltage reflection coefficient @xmath57 at the transition from the cable to the resonator  @xcite is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the complex reflected voltage , @xmath60 is the complex incoming voltage , and @xmath61 is the complex impedance of the resonator .",
    "the reflected power coefficient @xmath62 is then just @xmath63 .",
    "since rlc - series resonators have a very low impedance on resonance , @xmath64 , the transition from a 50@xmath3-cable to the resonator on resonance will reflect almost all the inserted power . in order to minimize the reflection ,",
