    "complex social networks arise in a wide range of contexts , for example as corporate partnership networks @xcite , scientist collaboration networks @xcite , company director networks @xcite , film actors networks @xcite , sexual contact networks @xcite , etc .",
    "indeed , a lot of attention has been given by both physical and social scientists in recent years to model these networks so as to gain better understandings of their general structures as well as their various functions like information flow @xcite , locating individuals @xcite , disease spread @xcite , etc . for",
    "a review of recent efforts , see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while there is an apparent increase in the number of network models in the literature ,",
    "not all of these models have taken full advantage of the sociological and psychological insights on how social networks may be formed .",
    "the principle of _ homophily _ , or in essence `` birds of a feather flock together , '' has been firmly established by many empirical studies @xcite .",
    "while we clearly tend to befriend those who are like us , there are many situations where having a lot of friends like us is simply because we are _ stuck _ with people who are like us in the first place .",
    "for example if you are a millionaire and all your friends are millionaires , it might simply be because you were born into an elite family and live in an elite area so you only know millionaires in your life , even though you do not actively choose to befriend millionaires over non - millionaires .",
    "therefore , it is useful to divide homophily into two main types : _ baseline _ homophily and _ inbreeding _ homophily @xcite .",
    "baseline homophily is attributed to the fact that we have a _ limited potential tie pool _ due to factors like demography and foci of activities @xcite .",
    "inbreeding homophily is conceptualised as any other kind of homophily measured over that potential tie pool  this may include homophily regarding gender , religion , social class , education , and other intra - personal or behavioural characteristics .",
    "while many network models have taken inbreeding homophily into account @xcite , they have generally assumed that there are no baseline homophily effects , i.e.  the potential tie pool for all actors equals the _ entire _ population .",
    "however , this is obviously not very realistic and baseline homophily effects can potentially have profound consequences on the structure of social networks .    a basic source of baseline homophily is the _ geographical space_. as a matter of simple opportunity and/or the need to minimise efforts to form and maintain a social tie @xcite , we can expect that we tend to form ties with those who are geographically close to us .",
    "thus , intuitively , this creates a very strong constraint on our potential tie pool .",
    "in fact , there is ample empirical evidence that demonstrates this claim .",
    "the earliest studies of which we are aware of date back to festinger _",
    "_ @xcite and caplow and forman @xcite both on student housing communities .",
    "the results showed that in these rather homogeneous communities , spatial arrangement of student rooms / units was an important factor in predicting whether two dwellers have at least weak ties .",
    "many other network studies also reached similar results , for example see @xcite .",
    "more recently , wellman @xcite and mok _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite re - analysed wellman s earlier dataset on torontorian personal communities @xcite and noted that most personal friendships were indeed `` local , '' contrary to the beliefs that recent technological advances have freed us from spatial constraints .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was found that on average @xmath0 of `` frequent contact '' ties live within a mere 1 mile radius of a typical person , while the rest of his / her ties could be directed to anywhere in the rest of the world .      before embarking on specifying the model",
    ", we shall review some of the general features of social networks .",
    "not many current models simultaneously displays all of these .",
    "we suggest that , by including baseline spatial homophily into our network model , one can reproduce all the following features , at least in broad terms :    1 .",
    "* low tie density . *",
    "the number of possible ties in a network is theoretically quadratic to the number of actors , but most networks realise only a tiny fraction of these ties . the cognitive ability of human places an upper bound on the number of ties one may maintain @xcite . on the other hand , other factors corresponding to baseline homophily can also play a role @xcite ; 2 .   * short average geodesic distances . *",
    "geodesic distance between two actors is defined to be the length of the shortest connection between them . in large social networks , it is believed that the typical geodesic distance between any two actors remains small .",
    "this property was demonstrated empirically by stanley milgram in his classical experiment in the 1960s @xcite , contributing to the popular saying that no one on this earth is separated from you by more than six `` handshakes '' ; 3 .",
    "* high level of clustering . * clustering is defined to be the average probability that two friends of an actor are themselves friends .",
    "equivalently , it is a measure of how having a mutual friend will heighten the conditional probability that the two friends of an actor will be friends themselves . in their well - known article @xcite",
    ", watts and strogatz demonstrated the importance of _ short - cuts _ in social networks that simultaneously display high clustering and short average geodesic distances .",
    "such an idea of short - cuts dates back to granovetter s arguments on the strength of weak ties @xcite ; 4 .   * positively skewed actor degree distribution .",
    "* the degree of an actor is the number of social ties he / she has . in many social networks ,",
    "a majority of actors have relatively small degrees , while a small number of actors may have very large degrees .",
    "this feature is displayed in a wide range of social networks .",
    "while it is still debated whether generic social networks have power - law , exponential , or other degree distributions , or indeed whether there is any _ generic _ distribution at all @xcite , there is no doubt that degree distributions are in general positively skewed ; 5 .   *",
    "existence of communities . * in many cases",
    ", clustering does not occur evenly over the entire network .",
    "we can often observed subgroups of actors who are highly connected within themselves but loosely connected to other subgroups which are themselves highly inter - connected .",
    "we call these highly - connected subgroups _ communities _",
    "a long tradition in social network analysis has developed a range of algorithms to identify these cohesive subsets of nodes @xcite .",
    "an example of a social network that displays all of the above properties is a well - known alliance network of 16 tribes in the eastern central highlands of new guinea @xcite .",
    "the network is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamapos ] where nodes correspond to tribes and ties correspond to alliances between the relevant tribes .",
    "first of all , the density of the network is fairly low ( @xmath1 ) given the small size of the network .",
    "the degree distribution is positively skewed ( skewness statistic = @xmath2 ) .",
    "the network is a `` small world '' in which it has low median geodesic distance ( @xmath3 ) and high level of clustering coefficient ( clustering coefficient = @xmath4 ) .",
    "most importantly , two distinct communities can be easily observed in fig.[fig : gamapos ] : one is disjoint from the rest and is fully connected ( i.e.  nodes 1 , 2 , 15 , and 16 ) and the other is highly connected within itself ( i.e.  nodes 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 11 , and 12 ) .",
    "we here represent social networks by non - directed graphs .",
    "a non - directed graph is defined to be a pair @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the _ node set _ denoting the individual actors in the network , and @xmath7 , with each edge @xmath8 being an unordered pair of nodes @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , is the _ edge set _ denoting the social ties among the actors . a compact way to represent a graph is through its _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 such that @xmath14 iff @xmath15 , otherwise @xmath16 . in general , the size of the set @xmath17 ( or equivalently the dimensions of @xmath18 ) is fixed but whether an edge @xmath19 ( or equivalently @xmath14 in @xmath18 ) is determined by a random process .",
    "such a random process is defined so as to reflect the underlying social dynamics .",
    "the simplest model for social networks is the erds - rnyi or _",
    "bernoulli _ random graph model , initiated independently by paul erds and alfred rnyi @xcite and anatol rapaport @xcite , where the random process is a _ bernoulli _ trial , i.e. @xmath20 where the constant @xmath21 $ ]",
    "is called the _",
    "edge probability_. in other words @xmath22 are identically and independently distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "bernoulli random variables . due to its simplicity , it is amenable to rigorous treatments .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to show that the average geodesic distance between any two nodes is @xmath23 , a feature that , as discussed above , resembles the property in some real networks .",
    "however the level of clustering in this model can be shown to vanish as @xmath24 and it is one of the major short - comings of this simple model in modelling social networks .",
    "further , erds and rnyi showed that there is a critical edge probability @xmath25 at which there always exists a connected component containing a significant proportion of nodes in the network ( almost surely ) @xcite .",
    "such component is known as the giant component . for an extensive review of these results",
    "refer to bollobs @xcite and janson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the erds - rnyi model is its simplicity .",
    "although it does not predict some of the generic features outlined above , it serves as a good foundation to build more realistic models . in this paper",
    ", we study a generalisation of erds - rnyi random graph model for social networks which incorporates a simple _ baseline spatial homophily _ effect in the formation of individual network ties .",
    "we note that this class of models is for a _ single snapshot _ of a network , thus _ temporal network dynamics _ are not taken into account . in section 2 , we shall specify the model and examine some of its basic properties . in section 3 , we shall outline our simulation methods and discuss the main results . in section 4",
    ", we shall demonstrate the application of our model in a particular social network . in section 5 , we shall discuss the implications of the results and describe ongoing research on this and more generalised models .",
    "first of all , we embedded the nodes of graphs in the euclidean space @xmath26 with a _ distance _ function @xmath27 defined to map any unordered pair of nodes to a real number , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "further , @xmath27 satisfies the standard triangle inequalities and the positivity condition .",
    "every node @xmath29 is assigned a coordinate @xmath30 according to some spatial distribution and we define @xmath31 to be the location vector that specifics the spatial locations of _ all _ nodes in a network .",
    "further we shall use the shorthand @xmath32 to denote the distance between nodes @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "next , we assume that the spatial locations of the nodes are randomly scattered in space ( and therefore all locations are mutually independent as well ) . in other words , we assumed that the points are distributed in space according to a homogeneous poisson point process ( see for example @xcite ) . recall that a poisson point process with rate @xmath34 in the @xmath27-dimensional euclidean space @xmath35 is a process such that :    * for all disjoint subsets @xmath36 , the random variable denoting the number of point in the each subset , @xmath37 , are independently distributed ; * @xmath38 has poisson distribution ; and * @xmath39 = \\rho |a|$ ] for all @xmath40 .",

    "motivated by the discussion in the last section , we shall consider the case where @xmath44 is a simple step function , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the average density of the network , @xmath47 is the _ neighbourhood radius _",
    ", @xmath48 is the _ proximity bias _ which specifies the sensitivity to geographical space by the actors on establishing social links .",
    "thus @xmath48 probabilistically controls the locations of potential tie pool .",
    "of course we have assumed that such a spatial sensitivity is the same for all actors in the network .",

    "the empirical edge probability @xmath138 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : comnet - pd ] .",
    "it displays the expected big drop at the small values of @xmath27 .",
    "based on this , we can fit @xmath138 with a simple step function with some neighbourhood size @xmath47 such that the sum of squared errors is minimal . in this case , @xmath47 is found to be @xmath139 . as the overall density @xmath46 is @xmath140 , the proximity bias @xmath48 is estimated to be @xmath141 , and the correction term @xmath50 is estimated to be @xmath142 using eq.[eq : delta ] . ] .",
    "the large bias @xmath48 indicates that there is a strong spatial component in the underlying social process .",
    "in this study , we have performed monte carlo simulations on a class of spatial random graph models .",
    "it has been found that the properties of these models differs significantly from the simple erds - rnyi random graph model . in particular , for a range of @xmath48 values , the model displays simultaneously many general features of social networks as discussed in section 1 while the erds - rnyi random graph model fails in many aspects .",
    "we note that the properties of the model are similar to those of the well - known watts - strogatz `` small world '' model @xcite but that the current model has the advantage of specifying an explicit probability distribution over the collection of all graphs with a given number of nodes .",
    "it is also important to note that the clustering properties of the current model arise entirely from the poisson process describing node locations and hence from a form of spatial baseline homophily .",
    "it is clearly an empirical question whether such models for social networks provide an adequate descriptive account or whether it is necessary to also incorporate inbreeding homophily effects ( as in exponential random graph selection models @xcite ) or endogenous network processes characteristic of the watts - strogatz model @xcite and more general exponential random graph model specifications @xcite .",
    "this is a question that has received little attention in the network literature despite its fundamental importance to our understanding of network evolution .    in order to identify models that provide a good match to empirical data",
    ", it will be useful to construct a nested family of exponential random graph models that can be used to evaluate the empirical evidence for spatial and other forms of baseline homophily , inbreeding homophily and endogenous clustering effects .",
    "indeed , reference to empirical data immediately raises the possibility of at least two alternative conceptualisations of a spatial model : the first , a geographical space , in which geographical coordinates are associated with each node ; and the second , a more abstract `` social '' space , in which spatial proximities reflect baseline homophily across a broad range of individual attributes . in each case ,",
    "spatial locations may be observed or unobserved . for the current model and the case of observed locations",
    ", it would be necessary to estimate the model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the combination of location and network data ; in the case of unobserved locations , it would be desirable to use a version of hoff , handcock and raftery s @xcite more general exponential random graph model specifications to estimate model parameters from network data alone .",
    "more generally , it would be desirable to construct within the exponential random graph model family , models that also include inbreeding homophily and endogenous clustering effects and associated estimation methods .",
    "the model described in this paper takes a useful first step towards the construction of such a family of models .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the fit of models to empirical data will need careful quantitative evaluation ( e.g.  as in @xcite ) because of the likely capacity of many models within the family to exhibit in broad terms the commonly observed features of empirical social networks laid out in section 1.2 .",
