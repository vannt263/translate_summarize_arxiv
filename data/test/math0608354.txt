    "recently there has been considerable progress in understanding the notion of ellipticity on noncompact manifolds and manifolds with singularities . for a wide class of manifolds , ellipticity conditions for operators",
    "were established and the corresponding finiteness theorems were proved ; the corresponding operator @xmath1-algebras were constructed .",
    "hence the study of _ topological _ aspects of the theory of elliptic operators becomes topical .",
    "here one mainly speaks of the classification problem and the index problem . note that gelfand s homotopy classification problem for elliptic operators can naturally be restated in modern language as the problem of computing the @xmath0-groups of symbol algebras , which prove noncommutative in most cases .",
    "thus gelfand s problem naturally fits in the framework of topical problems of connes s noncommutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with elliptic theory on manifolds with corners .",
    "operators on manifolds with corners have been actively studied , and a number of important interesting results emerged recently .",
    "for example , the @xmath1-closure of symbol algebras was studied in  @xcite , and a spectral sequence converging to the @xmath0-theory of the @xmath1-algebra of symbols was constructed .",
    "monthubert  @xcite obtained a description of the operator algebra in the spirit of noncommutative geometry in terms of a special groupoid that can be associated with a manifold with corners ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "bunke  @xcite constructed index theory of atiyah  patodi  singer type for dirac operators and studied cohomological obstructions to elliptic problems ( see also @xcite ) ; monthubert and nistor  @xcite produced a formula for the boundary map in the @xmath0-theory of symbol algebras in topological terms .",
    "krainer  @xcite studied boundary value problems in this setting .",
    "although these results permitted finding the group classifying the homotopy classes of elliptic operators in a number of special cases ( e.g. , see  @xcite or @xcite ) , the homotopy classification problem remained open .",
    "we solve gelfand s problem for _ manifolds with corners_. our goal is to obtain a simple explicit formula for the classifying group in terms of atiyah s @xmath0-homology functor @xcite .",
    "note that the idea of classifying elliptic operators by the @xmath0-homology functor has long been known . for the reader",
    "s convenience , we recall it using operators on a smooth compact manifold @xmath2 as an example .",
    "the commutator of an elliptic zero - order operator @xmath3 on @xmath2 with the operator of multiplication by a continuous function @xmath4 is compact @xmath5\\in \\mathcal{k}.\\ ] ] by one definition , the _",
    "contravariant @xmath0-theory _",
    "@xmath6 of the algebra @xmath7 just consists of fredholm operators for which the commutators   are compact .",
    "thus @xmath3 determines an element of the group @xmath6 , which is isomorphic to the @xmath0-homology group of @xmath2 : @xmath8 by the atiyah  brown  douglas  fillmore  kasparov theorem .",
    "thus , assigning the corresponding class in the @xmath0-homology to each elliptic operator , we obtain a mapping @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the group of elliptic operators in sections of bundles on @xmath2 modulo stable homotopy and @xmath11 is the even @xmath0-homology group of @xmath12 .",
    "kasparov showed this mapping to be an isomorphism .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-homology group of a smooth manifold classifies elliptic operators on this manifold modulo stable homotopy .",
    "this approach to classification also proved fruitful in the case of compact stratified manifolds with singularities .",
    "namely , it was shown in  @xcite that in this case the even @xmath0-homology group of the underlying compact topological space classifies elliptic operators on this manifold .    however , no classification results were known for manifolds with corners of codimension @xmath13 .",
    "the classification in the form of the @xmath0-homology of the manifold with corners , which suggests itself , is too meagre to be true : one can always smooth the corners , and we see that the @xmath0-homology of the manifold with corners is too coarse an invariant , for it does not take into account the structure of a manifold with corners .",
    "moreover even the space whose @xmath0-homology would classify elliptic operators was unknown .",
    "we establish the isomorphism @xmath14 where @xmath2 is a manifold with corners and @xmath15 is the dual manifold ( see @xcite ) which is a stratified manifold with singularities .",
    "more precisely , the isomorphism will be established under the following assumption concerning the combinatorial structure of the faces of our manifold :    _ the normal bundles of all faces of @xmath2 are trivial . _",
    "if this assumption fails , then , generally speaking , the isomorphism does not hold . in this case",
    ", one should abandon the search for a classifying _",
    "space _ and seek some _ algebra _ whose @xmath0-cohomology classifies elliptic operators .",
    "this algebra proves to be noncommutative , and one needs to use ideas on noncommutative geometry .",
    "these results will be considered elsewhere .",
    "note an interesting special case : if a manifold with corners is a polyhedron with a given triangulation of the boundary , then the dual stratified space is also a polyhedron , namely , the one used in the classical proof of poincar duality in cohomology ! for example , if @xmath2 is a cube , then @xmath15 is an octahedron .",
    "thus the construction of the dual manifold in the first part  @xcite of the present paper generalizes the _ poincar dual polyhedron _ to the case of noncontractible faces .",
    "note that there is a different perspective on the theory of operators on manifolds with corners .",
    "an application of a logarithmic change of variables in a neighborhood of the boundary taking the boundary to infinity ( see fig .  [ ris4 ] , where this is shown for manifolds with boundary ) results in the class of so - called _ manifolds with multicylindrical ends_. these two pictures give the same operator algebras .",
    "thus the results of the present paper also provide classification on manifolds with multicylindrical ends .",
    "this is the second of the two parts of the paper . in the first part",
    "@xcite , the dual manifold of a manifold with corners was constructed and calculus of pseudodifferential operators ( @xmath16do ) on manifolds with corners was developed in the @xmath1-algebraic context .    the present part has the following structure .    in the first section",
    ", we recall some information from  @xcite . in sec .  2",
    ", we state the classification theorem .",
    "the proof occupies the next three sections .",
    "note that the general scheme of the proof is the same as in  @xcite , and we proceed by induction , passing from a smooth manifold to increasingly complex manifolds with singularities . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the relationship with some results due to monthubert and nistor . as a consequence of the classification theorem",
    ", we obtain a @xmath0-homology criterion for the vanishing of the index and a formula for the @xmath0-group of the @xmath1-algebra of @xmath16do with zero interior symbol ( this algebra corresponds to the @xmath1-algebra of the groupoid constructed by monthubert ) . in the appendix ,",
    "we prove a higher analog of the relative index theorem , which naturally arises when we obtain the classification of operators .",
    "here we recall some information given in  @xcite .    consider a manifold @xmath2 with corners of depth @xmath17 .",
    "it has a natural stratification @xmath18 where the stratum @xmath19 is just the interior of @xmath2 and each stratum @xmath20 is the union of connected components , open faces @xmath21 of codimension @xmath22 in @xmath2 .",
    "each face @xmath23 in the stratum @xmath20 is isomorphic to the interior of a manifold @xmath24 , which will be called a closed face of @xmath2 .",
    "faces of codimension one are called _",
    "hyperfaces_.      the main results of the paper will be obtained under the following assumption .",
    "[ assa1 ] the normal bundle @xmath25 of each face @xmath26 is trivial .    in this case , the local defining functions @xmath27 of @xmath26 are globally defined as functions on the normal bundle @xmath25 .",
    "assumption [ assa1 ] holds if all hyperfaces are _ embedded _ ,",
    "i.e. , if there exists a global defining function for each hyperface @xmath28 . however , it also holds , for some manifolds with nonembedded hyperfaces , say , for the raindrop .",
    "the simplest example of a manifold with corners that does not satisfy assumption  [ assa1 ] is the klein bottle with raindrop instead of the circle as the base .",
    "the dual space @xmath29 of a manifold @xmath2 with corners was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "if the original manifold is represented as the union @xmath30 then @xmath15 is the union of _ dual faces _",
    ", @xmath31 each of which is isomorphic to the interior of a simplex @xmath32 here , by definition , @xmath33 is the interior of @xmath2 .",
    "thus to each face @xmath26 of codimension @xmath22 in @xmath2 there corresponds a simplex @xmath34 of dimension @xmath35 in the dual space .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that a neighborhood @xmath36 of the stratum @xmath37 is homeomorphic to the product of @xmath37 by the cone @xmath38 whose base @xmath39 is the dual space @xmath40 of the closed face @xmath41 ( which is well defined , since @xmath41 itself is a manifold with corners ) . as a result , we find that @xmath15 is a stratified manifold with singularities .",
    "let @xmath2 be a manifold with corners satisfying assumption [ assa1 ] , and let @xmath42 be the @xmath1-algebra of zero - order @xmath16do in the space @xmath43 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of a @xmath16do acting on sections of finite - dimensional vector bundles on @xmath2 is introduced in the usual way .",
    "there is a natural equivalence relation , _ stable homotopy _ , on the set of elliptic operators .",
    "recall the definition .",
    "two elliptic operators @xmath44 on @xmath2 are said to be _ stably homotopic _ if there exists a continuous homotopy @xmath45 of elliptic operators , where @xmath46 are vector bundles and @xmath47 are bundle isomorphisms .    here",
    "ellipticity is understood as the invertibility of all components of the symbol of the operator , and only homotopies of @xmath16do preserving ellipticity are considered .",
    "stable homotopy is an equivalence relation on the set of elliptic @xmath16do acting in sections of vector bundles . by @xmath48",
    "we denote the corresponding quotient set .",
    "it is a group with respect to the direct sum of operators , and the inverse in this group is given by the coset of the almost inverse operator ( i.e. , an inverse modulo compact operators ) .",
    "odd elliptic theory @xmath49 is defined in a similar way as the group of stable homotopy classes of elliptic self - adjoint operators .",
    "stabilization is defined in terms of the operators @xmath50 .",
    "an equivalent definition of the odd @xmath51-group can be given in terms of smooth operator families on @xmath12 with parameter space @xmath52 modulo constant families .",
    "we shall compute the groups @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. , find the classification of elliptic operators modulo stable homotopy .",
    "our approach is based on the following fact ( see the definition of @xmath16do in  @xcite ) :    _ @xmath16do on @xmath2 can be viewed as local operators in the sense of atiyah on the dual manifold @xmath15 . _    thus an elliptic @xmath16do defines a fredholm module on the space @xmath43 viewed as a @xmath56-module .",

    "the compactness follows from the fact that , by construction , on each face @xmath28 either the corresponding symbol of our operator is invertible or the functions in the algebra @xmath68 are zero .    by lemma  [ lem1a ] ,",
