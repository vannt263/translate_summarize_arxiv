    "they consist of a low mass main sequence star filling its critical roche lobe and a magnetic white dwarf accreting matter from its companion .",
    "the strong magnetic field channels the accretion flow into a small area on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "in this area the temperature rises to values of several 100000 k and shifts the emission of reprocessed radiation into the soft x - ray regime .",
    "therefore an efficient way to detect these systems is to search the sky for ( highly ) variable extreme ultraviolet or soft x - ray emitters .",
    "the great success of rosat , asca , and euve in detecting these systems is demonstrated by the fact , that before rosat only 17 polars were known ( cropper  1990 ) whilst as of today this number has increased to 63 .",
    "other sources of radiation in these systems are thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the accretion column , observed at higher x - ray energies ( typically 10 to 20  kev ) , cyclotron emission from the accretion column due to the strong magnetic field , often dominating the optical regime , and radiation from the secondary star , strongest in the infrared and sometimes only being detectable , if the system is in a state of low accretion . detailed discussions of these systems can be found in the books by warner ( 1995 ) and campbell ( 1997 ) .",
    "early reviews on the basis of the new rosat data have been presented among others by beuermann & thomas ( 1993 ) , watson ( 1994 ) , beuermann & burwitz ( 1995 ) , and schwope ( 1995 ) , a more recent one by beuermann ( 1997 ) .",

    "the mean count rate obtained from the light curve is 1.94 @xmath2 . in one rosat orbit a count rate far above the average ( 6.5 @xmath2 )",
    "was measured .",
    "we consider this as a singular event not typical for the orbital variation . without this point",
    "the mean count rate drops to 1.68 @xmath2 . in order to show that the light curve is not dominated by changes between binary orbits",
    "we have used two different symbols in fig .  2 for the first and second half of the observation .",
    "a period search without the point at 6.5 @xmath2  revealed a likely period of @xmath11  min .",
    "it should be noted that at no phase did the count rate drop to zero , so the accretion area giving rise to the x - ray emission never completely vanishes from view behind the horizon of the white dwarf .",

    "spectra taken during the other observing runs have been analyzed for radial velocities , flux contribution from the secondary star , and cyclotron emission .",
    "because of lower resolution , incomplete orbital coverage , or less favorable observing conditions they mainly helped to reinforce and confirm the results obtained from the march  97 data and are important for excluding possible alias periods .",
    "in all low resolution spectra the tio absorption bands from the secondary are easily recognized .",

    "97 data we first estimated the gradient of the cyclotron emission between 7165    and 7500    by subtracting suitably scaled spectra of the m - dwarf gl  207.1 and corrected the measured flux differences for that .",
    "we also tried to fit spectra of other m - dwarfs ( e.g. gl 205 , gl 352 ) but with less satisfactory results . from these 35 spectra",
    "we obtained a mean value of @xmath35@xmath36erg@xmath15s@xmath16@xmath16 for the flux difference .",
    "this value is reduced by 2% if we exclude all spectra with phases between 0.25 and 0.75 , i.e. looking at the unilluminated backside of the secondary . in the following we use a value of @xmath37@xmath36erg@xmath15s@xmath16@xmath16 .",
    "= 8.8 cm    filling its critical roche lobe the secondary must have a mean density of @xmath38 for a system period of 4.19h .",

    "97 data give a slightly earlier zero point than the absorption line data ( difference in phase : @xmath44 ) and we have used the mean of both data sets .",
    "the resulting ephemeris is ( errors of the last digits are given in brackets ) :    @xmath45    the relatively large error in the zero point reflects the difference in determining the blue - to - red zero - crossing from both the narrow emission and the absorption line measurements .",
    "the total time span between our first and last observation amounts to 2667 days or 15276 cycles .",
    "thus the maximum error in the phasing calculated from the error for the period is 0.013 , which excludes any errors in the cycle count .",
    "the measurements shown in the two lower panels of fig .  8 clearly demonstrate that the narrow emission line flux is stronger and the absorption line flux weaker than average when the illuminated side of the secondary is in view of the observer .",
    "such a behavior can be understood with the irradiation model of beuermann & thomas ( 1990 ) . using the amplitude of @xmath46 km / s measured for the absorption lines the model determines the inclination angle as a function of mass ratio .",
    "we have assumed that the contribution to the absorption line flux from the illuminated side is negligible . for primary masses of 0.5 and 1.1m@xmath39",
    "we obtain inclinations of 52  and 31 , respectively , taking 0.45m@xmath39 for the mass of the secondary .",
    "the corresponding velocities for the emission lines are then 51 and 98  km / s .",
    "looking at the measured values ( table  2 ) this would favor the low inclination and so a high primary mass . a low inclination also roughly fits the observed line fluxes , an example is shown in fig .",
    "8 ( middle panel , dotted line ) . for the inclination of 66  derived below ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) this is not the case .",
    "but if we assume that a substantial contribution to the line flux comes from the unilluminated side of the secondary the situation changes .",
    "to reproduce the observed average amplitude of 102.6 km / s for the narrow emission lines , @xmath47% of the line flux ( averaged over the surface of the secondary ) must be generated by illumination .",
    "we then obtain the line flux variation displayed in fig .",
    "8 ( middle panel , solid line ) , which fits the observed variation best , except for those measurements where the radial velocity curves of broad and narrow component cross each other and therefore a separation into the two components is difficult to achieve . while this result depends only weakly on the assumed inclination it shows that the observed line flux and velocity amplitude for the narrow emission are consistent with a high inclination if part of the emission line flux is generated on the unilluminated side of the secondary .      for the data taken during a low state in dec .",
    "95 , we represent the spectral flux in the 14 individual low - resolution spectra by the sum of a rayleigh - jeans spectrum , an m - star spectrum , and a cyclotron spectrum .",

    "it was obtained in a iterative procedure starting with a coarse grid of cyclotron spectra which allowed to fix @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and then refining the grid for the other parameters .",
    "the poor fit at phase 0.915 may be the result of absorption by the accretion stream which is in front of the accretion area around phase 0.95 .",
    "the rather high inclination can only be made consistent with the results from the irradiation model for a white dwarf mass of 0.39m@xmath39 ( see sect .  3.5 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are in conflict with the assumption of a pure dipolar field configuration because that requires @xmath66 .",
    "also this simple model does not reproduce the spectral shape at short wavelengths , probably due to a more complicated accretion geometry than used here .    using the parameters derived above we computed the gravity darkening in the roche geometry .",
    "for the ratio of primary minimum to maximum we obtained a value between 0.87 ( without limb - darkening ) and 0.83 ( 50% limb - darkening ) , in agreement with the value for the ellipsoidal variation deduced above .",
    "for the values of @xmath54 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 the sinusoidal variation of the rayleigh - jeans component can be explained assuming a constant contribution from the white dwarf photosphere plus a varying contribution from the accretion area .",
    "the fluxes in the v - band then amount to 2.8 and 0.85 , respectively , both in units of @xmath36erg@xmath15s@xmath16@xmath16 . at the derived distance",
    "the constant flux gives an absolute magnitude of m@xmath67 , corresponding to a photospheric temperature of @xmath114000k .",
    "the flux ratio of the variable to constant component in an accretion area occupying a fraction @xmath68 on the white dwarfs surface requires a temperature which is a factor @xmath69 higher than the temperature of the white dwarf , in reasonable aggreement with the results of gnsicke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we also tried to fit the spectropolarimetric data from may  98 , which do not suffer from the uncertainties introduced by the subtraction of other flux contributions .",
    "but because of the incomplete orbital coverage we can only state that magnetic field strength , inclination , and field direction are similar , while the thickness @xmath58 must be somewhat larger to produce the high circularly polarized flux at 3950    around phase 0.4 ( see fig .",
    "we plan to repeat these observations , which will then allow us to check the system parameters derived above .",
    "cyclotron spectra extracted from the mar .",
    "97 data show similar variations with phase as the data of dec .",
    "95 , but the removal of other flux contributions introduced too large an uncertainty , so we did not try to fit cyclotron spectra to that dataset .",
    "these considerations also allow us to qualitatively understand the behavior of the v - flux variations ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in a low state both the cyclotron flux and the ellipsoidal variations of",
    "the secondary cause a light curve with two maxima during one orbit , while in a high state the contribution of the secondary is negligible and the cyclotron flux contribution most likely comes from a more extended accretion area .",
    "the minimum around phase 0.5 which resulted from a viewing angle close to 90  will then be filled in because of contributions from other parts of the accretion area at lower viewing angles .",
    "we now turn to the x - ray light curves and spectra obtained during the rass and the two rosat pspc and hri pointed observations .",
    "since the inclination is larger than the field line direction it is expected that at least part of the x - ray flux is absorbed by the stream of matter towards the white dwarf .",
    "this explains the low flux around phase 0.95 both in the rass and to some degree in the hri pointing .",
    "the reduction in the count rate by a factor 50 between the rass and the pspc pointing and the corresponding change in the hardness ratio @xmath70 from @xmath71 to 0.28 could partially be the result of a lower blackbody temperature .",
    "although the best fit temperature for the pointing is 50ev ( @xmath72/d.o.f .",
    "22/10 ) , with a reduction of the blackbody flux by a factor 230 compared to the rass , the fit allows for much higher blackbody fluxes if the temperature would be lower : at 15ev , the total blackbody flux decreases by a factor 14 only compared to the rass ( @xmath72/d.o.f .",
    "this is of the same order as the reduction in cyclotron flux between the observations in feb .",
    "93 and dec .",
    "95 ( factor 7.4 ) .",
    "the contribution of the bremsstrahlung flux to the pspc pointed data is reduced by a factor 2.3 compared to the rass .",
    "the masses determined above are in conflict with present understanding of stable mass transfer . for donor stars with masses below @xmath73m@xmath39",
    "mass transfer is dynamically unstable for mass ratios m@xmath74/m@xmath75 ( webbink 1985 ) .",
    "the lower limit of 0.38m@xmath39 for the mass of the secondary ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) also does not fulfil the criterion for stability . even if we assume an evolved secondary as in kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) we arrive at masses of 0.31m@xmath39 for the white dwarf and 0.25m@xmath39 for the m  star , again violating the stability criterion .",
    "the mass ratio is determined from the observed absorption line velocity and the inclination .",
    "so we turn the question around and ask , for which inclination would the stability criterion be satisfied ? taking the derived mass of the secondary we then need a primary mass of 0.64m@xmath39 and an inclination of 45.3 .",
    "that implies a variation of the viewing angle around this value , which in turn causes cyclotron emission lines to be shifted to the blue as compared to our data in fig .",
    "especially above 8000  the spectral flux should strongly increase with wavelength for all phases due to the presence of the next lower harmonic , which in fig .",
    "10 only marginally shows up around phase zero .",
    "therefore with our data we can see no remedy to the present situation .",
    "so the stability problem makes rx  j1313.23259 an interesting system for future observations in four aspects : a ) the contribution of the secondary star to the spectrum , best observable during a low state , b ) the absorption line flux variation relevant for modelling the illumination , c ) the degree of circular polarization as a function of orbital phase , and d ) the white dwarf contribution to the spectrum , best observable in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "finally , we note that constraining the mass of the white dwarf is important for our understanding of the formation of cataclysmic variables , because with the period determined above models of common envelope evolution predict that the mass of the white dwarf should exceed 0.6m@xmath39 ( de kool 1992 ) .",
    "lcc & high state & low state + cyclotron emission & 1.7 & 0.2 + blackbody radiation & 1.0  3.0 & 0.0  0.1 + thermal bremsstrahlung & 0.1  0.3 & 0.1 + total flux & 2.8  5.0 & 0.3  0.4 + mass accretion rate & 4.3  7.7 & 0.5  0.6 +    for an estimate of the mass accretion rate one has to sum up all flux contributions from the accretion area .",
    "although the optical and x - ray observations are not simultaneous we take the optical observations in feb .",
    "93 and the x - ray observations during the rass as representative of the high state and those of dec .",
    "95 in the optical and july  92 in x - rays of the low state . to extend the observations to the whole frequency range we used",
    "the model fits for cyclotron emission , blackbody radiation , and thermal bremsstrahlung , respectively .",
    "the main uncertainty in these values is caused by the uncertainty in the blackbody temperature .",
    "therefore we took the @xmath76 upper and lower limits of 68 and 41  ev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) for the rass data and assumed temperature limits of 15 and 50  ev for the pspc data ( see sect .",
    "3.4 ) , to provide a range for the derived fluxes .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 . from the total fluxes we computed the mass accretion rates for a distance of 200  pc , a white dwarf mass of 0.4  m@xmath39 , and a white dwarf radius of @xmath77 cm .",
    "it has been shown that rx  j1313.23259 belongs to the class of magnetic cataclysmic variables called am herculis binaries or polars .",
    "it has a period of 251.4  min , which places it above the period gap , and a distance of @xmath1  200  pc . from the occurrence of cyclotron humps a magnetic field strength of 56",
    "mg for the main accreting pole has been deduced .",
    "the inclination is @xmath78  66  implying a white dwarf mass of @xmath1  0.4  m@xmath39 , with a likely mass for the secondary of 0.45  m@xmath39 , corresponding to a mass ratio @xmath79 .",
    "a rough estimate of the mass accretion rate leads to @xmath80m@xmath39yr@xmath16 for the high state and @xmath81m@xmath39yr@xmath16 for the low state .",
    "the rather low mass of the white dwarf required for reproducing the observed cyclotron emission is in conflict with our present understanding of stable mass transfer and the evolutionary history of cataclysmic variables , so further observations of this system are of great interest .",
