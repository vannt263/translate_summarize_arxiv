    "in the last years gaussian states have received a tremendous interest @xcite@xcite , due to the fact that most quantum operations can be performed with continuous variables , of which gaussian states represent the most important class .",
    "the advantage with respect to discrete variables ( qubit ) is that the optical implementation of continuous variables is available and robust .",
    "a relevant application of gaussian states is given by quantum communications ( qc ) , which in practice are implemented by coherent states , the most important subclass of gaussian states .",
    "often in qc coherent states are not related explicitly to gaussian states @xcite@xcite , but their recent developments lead to a very elegant and powerful theory , so that it seems important to revisit qc using this theory .    in this context",
    "we reconsider qc having as information carrier gaussian states and we assume that a finite set ( constellation ) of gaussian states has a special form of symmetry , called _ geometrically uniform symmetry _ ( gus ) . a constellation having the gus is generated starting from a single reference state through a unitary operator , called _",
    "the gus has the advantage , not only of simplifying the theory of qc , but also to derive the optimal decision measurements , otherwise not possible .",
    "it is worth to remark that the standard form of gus is enjoyed by almost all constellations considered for practical qc , namely _ phase shift keying _ ( psk ) and _ pulse position modulation _ ( ppm ) .",
    "also _ quadrature amplitude modulation _ ( qam ) verifies a generalized form of gus .",
    "since we want to establish completely general results , valid for multimode gaussian states , a fundamental preliminary is a clear and compact formulation of the most general gaussian state and of the most general gaussian transformation ( gaussian unitary ) . to this end",
    "we follow the theory developed by ma and rhodes in a seminal paper published in 1990 @xcite .",
    "this theory has the advantage to handle , through an appropriate algebra of operators , the general @xmath0-mode gaussian states in much the same way as the single ",
    "mode gaussian states .",
    "substantially it proves that the most general gaussian unitary is given by a cascade combination of a squeezing , a displacement , and a rotation .",
    "finally we will prove that , starting from an arbitrary @xmath0-mode gaussian state , we can generate a gus constellation , where the symmetry operator is provided by the rotation operator with an appropriate amount of rotation",
    ".    in the literature only qc systems using coherent states have been considered and little attention has been devoted to the appealing possibility of using squeezed states @xcite . to this end",
    "we revisit qc , where the main problem is the optimization of quantum detection to achieve the minimum error probability . as known , this problem is very difficult and exact solutions are established only in few cases . to overcome this difficulty , suboptimal solutions are considered , the most important of which is given by the square - root measurements ( srm ) , introduced by hausladen _ at al .",
    "_ @xcite and subsequently developed as least square measurement ( lsm ) by eldar and forney @xcite @xcite .",
    "this technique is not in general optimal , but gives a good approximation of the optimum ( `` pretty good '' is the judgment given by the authors and very often echoed in the literature ) .",
    "the srm / lsm can be applied with any constellation , but in the presence of gus it provides the optimal solution in an easy and explicit form .",
    "this holds when the detection is based on pure states ; with mixed states the srm technique is suboptimal , but gives a very accurate overestimate of the error probability , surely better than the quantum chernov bound usually considered with gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gauss ]",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-mode gaussian states and gaussian transformations and discuss their most general representations in terms of unitary gaussian transformations .",
    "section  [ gus ] is devoted to gaussian states equipped with the gus . in section  [ applications ] we present an application of the theory to the quantum detection for ppm , which requires a non trivial analysis in a multimode hilbert space .",
    "explicit examples of error probability are carried out considering as quantum carrier in ppm both coherent and squeezed states .",
    "we adopt the following notation : @xmath1 denotes transposition , while @xmath2 has the multiple role of adjoint for operators , hermitian conjugation for matrices , and complex conjugation for numbers .",
    "the * normalization * follows the notation of @xcite , where in particular the reduced planck constant is set to @xmath3 .",

    "a particular case of ( [ u24 ] ) with @xmath41 gives the beam splitter , while the most popular forms of squeezing ( single mode and two - mode ) are particular cases of ( [ u26 ] ) for @xmath42 .",
    "note that the above fundamental unitaries are special cases of the general gaussian unitary @xmath43 with @xmath17 a hamiltonian , quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators collected in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as we shall see below , all gaussian transformations are obtained as combination of these operators , and the corresponding gaussian states are typically generated starting from replicas of vacuum states or of coherent states .",
    "we are particularly interested in the cascade combination , where one can switch the order of operators with an appropriate change in the parameters @xcite @xmath46      the importance of the fundamental unitaries lies in the following :    [ p5 ] the most general gaussian unitary is given by the cascade combination of the three fundamental gaussian unitaries : @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , cascaded in any arbitrary order by a proper adjustments of the parameters .",
    "the proof can be obtained for the general multimode using the lie algebra : ma and rhodes @xcite , generalizing a previous result obtained for the single mode @xcite@xcite , proved that a unitary operator @xmath50 , where @xmath17 is a general @xmath0-mode quadratic hamiltonian , can be written in the form @xmath51 where the phasor @xmath52 with @xmath53 is irrelevant for the state generation .",
    "on the other hand we can apply the switching rules ( [ sra][src ] ) to change the order of the fundamental unitaries in ( [ k16 ] ) , with appropriate modifications of the parameters .    in the phase space a gaussian unitary is equivalent to a symplectic map ( [ t42 ] ) , specified by the pair @xmath29 . the gaussian unitary can always be written in the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 corresponds to the map @xmath56 and the displacement operator @xmath48 in the phase space provides the displacement @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,      the most general gaussian state can be derived by combination of the _ thermal decomposition _ and theorem  [ p5 ] .    in a gaussian state with",

    "application of williamson s theorem gives the so called _ thermal decomposition _ of a gaussian state @xcite , that is , an arbitrary @xmath0-mode zero  mean gaussian state can be generated by the * tensor product of @xmath0 single - mode thermal states * , with covariance matrix @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 identity , and number of thermal photons @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , a single  mode thermal state is specified by a covariance matrix @xmath70 , with average photon number @xmath71 .",
    "now , according to ( [ w2 ] ) , the @xmath0-mode gaussian state with the diagonal covariance matrix @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73 however , by theorem  [ p5 ] , we know that @xmath55 can be written as the cascade combination @xmath74 or @xmath75 . then , a zero  mean gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath8 is generated from @xmath76 in the form @xmath77 , where @xmath55 is the unitary operator corresponding to the symplectic transformation @xmath63 of decomposition ( [ w2 ] ) .    a gaussian state with * non  zero mean * is generated by introducing in @xmath78 an appropriate displacement operator . in conclusion , by combination of the previous statements :    [ h4 ] the most general @xmath0-mode gaussian state is generated from thermal state ( [ w8 ] ) by application of the three fundamental unitaries as @xmath79 where the order @xmath80 can be permuted according to ( [ sra])([src ] ) .",
    "for the particular case of pure states , the thermal decomposition degenerates into the product of @xmath0 replicas of the vacuum state , say @xmath81 , and then @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "but we can invert the order of squeezing and rotation with the rules ( [ sra])([src ] ) and after the change , @xmath84 . in conclusion :    [ h5 ] the most general @xmath0-mode pure gaussian state is obtained from the @xmath0 replica of the vacuum @xmath81 as @xmath85    in words , the most general @xmath0-mode gaussian pure state is a squeezed  displaced state or a displaced  squeezed state .",

    "the measurement bob estimates the state sent by alice .",
    "the _ correct decision probability _ is @xcite @xmath96 the choice of the measurement operators maximizing @xmath97 is a ( generally difficult ) key problem in qc . in particular ,",

    "the interest of this case resides both in the fact that it corresponds to many practical situations and that the optimal measurements is easy to obtain @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we now define the gus for pure states and we assume equiprobable symbols , @xmath102 , but the definition can be extended to generic a priori probabilities @xmath103 substituting the states with the weighted states @xmath104 or @xmath105 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the analysis of a quantum ppm system ( limited to coherent states ) has been done in a famous article by yuen , kennedy and lax @xcite who found the optimal elementary projectors using an algebraic method developed `` ad hoc '' for this kind of modulation . in @xcite",

    "]    the interpretation in the phase space may be the following . in the phase space , thinking to the wigner function , an inner product as @xmath272 depends on the distance between the two states , which is provided by the displacement @xmath122 , but also on the `` orientation '' of the squeezing , which is determined by the phase @xmath40 .",
    "we know that in a squeezed displaced state @xmath273 the noise variances are different and pictorially this difference can be represented by a tilted ellipse , as shown in fig .",

    "the ellipse degenerates into a circle in the case of a coherent state ( and for the ground state ) . with the objective to minimize the error probability ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath269 is sought .",
    "form the figure we can easily realize that a squeezing factor with @xmath275 gives a worst error probability than the use of a coherent state , while the best performance is achieved with @xmath276 .    the error probability computed from ( [ c29 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath277 in perfect agreement with the results of @xcite .",

    "we see in the expression of @xmath279 ( [ r2 ] ) that a contribution comes from the displacement and one form the squeezing .",
    "if we fix a value of @xmath39 , the minimum of @xmath279 becomes @xmath282 and for @xmath283 there is no room for the displacement .    in fig .",
    "[ 8ppmquantum ] we present the error probability as a function of @xmath284 for coherent states and other three values of the squeezing factor .",
    "we must have @xmath285 , for @xmath286 , @xmath287 and for @xmath288 , @xmath289 . ]",
    "note that , by properly choosing the value of @xmath37 , one can reduce dramatically the error probability with respect to the use of coherent states .",
    "we have seen that gus plays a fundamental role in quantum communications , due to the optimality of measurement operators obtained by the srm in the quantum discrimination .",
    "the considerations on gaussian states and their invariance properties with respect to unitary transformations and in particular rotations allow one to construct constellations of gaussian states having the gus , for example coherent states for their use in quantum optical communications . moreover , the transmission of such states through and additive - noise channel preserves the gus .",
    "the theory of the gus applied to the most general gaussian states extends the analysis of the performance of a qc system employing ppm ( or other modulations with gus ) to the most general case , not limiting the evaluation to the case of coherent states .",
