    "levitation melting ( elm ) was invented in the twenties of the last century @xcite whereas its usage started only at the beginning of the fifties @xcite when high - frequency power generators became available .",
    "the basic principle of elm is simple : a conducting sample , usually metallic , weighting from several tens of grams up to several kilograms is placed in a coil fed by an ac current with a typical frequency ranging from about @xmath2 up to several @xmath3 .",
    "the ac magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sample which , in turn , give rise to two effects . on one hand ,",
    "eddy currents interact with those in the coil giving rise to a lorentz force that repels the sample from the coil . on the other hand ,",
    "the ohmic dissipation due to the induced currents provides heating of the sample .",
    "in such a way , the sample can be levitated and also melted , provided that the coil configuration and the current in it are properly adjusted .",
    "elm is particularly useful for melting reactive metals with high melting points , for example such as _ ti _ , _ zr _ , _ v _ , _ ta _ , _ mo _ , which often react with the crucible material and so get polluted by it @xcite .",
    "elm avoids contamination of the melt and allows one to carry out solidification from deeply under - cooled states which is of interest for certain material science applications @xcite .",
    "besides , elm is a well - known method for measurements of material properties of liquid metals used on ground as well as in space @xcite .",
    "the balance of gravity and electromagnetic forces is necessary but not sufficient for a successful levitation .",
    "in addition , the sample has to be stable at least to perturbations of sufficiently small amplitude .",
    "first , it means that the reaction force due to the displacement of the sample from its equilibrium position has to act against that displacement .",
    "otherwise , the equilibrium will be statically unstable and the solid sample will fall out of the coil or touch it when it is slightly perturbed .",
    "similarly , a molten sample may leak out of the coil in the result of surface folding and deformation @xcite .",
    "the static stability alone may also be insufficient for a successful levitation because sometimes the sample exhibits overstability .",
    "namely , there is a restoring force that makes the sample to execute oscillations with increasing amplitude so that the sample eventually hits the coil or leaves it @xcite .",
    "similarly , sometimes the sample is observed to spin - up @xcite .",
    "a purely electromagnetic theory trying to account for such dynamic instabilities has been proposed in our previous work and applied to some simple configurations of magnetic fields @xcite . in this study",
    ", we apply our previous theory to analyze both the static and dynamic stability of a spherical sample in more realistic axisymmetric magnetic systems made of a set of coaxial circular current loops .",
    "although the basic configuration is axisymmetric , the perturbation fields are , in general , three - dimensional that renders the problem mathematically more complicated . to calculate 3d fields for a spherical sample we use similar analytic techniques as in refs .",
    "however , our approach differs from the previous ones by an original use of the gauge transformation for the 3d vector potential in order to satisfy boundary conditions for the induced current .",
    "this allows us to carry out the analysis only in terms of the vector potential without considering the scalar electrostatic potential .",
    "therefore our approach is considerably simpler compared to @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the stability of small amplitude oscillations of arbitrary direction is considered in sec .",
    "2 beginning with the governing equations and analytic solutions for the vector potential of a circular current loop in spherical harmonics . in this section",
    "we also derive solutions for the axisymmetric base state and the perturbation field due to a small displacement .",
    "section 3 presents governing equations and analytic solution for the spin - up instability . numerical results for both instabilities in several simple inductors are discussed in section 4 and summarized in section 5 .",

    "the magnetic field of an inductor consisting of a set of coaxial circular loops represents a superposition of the fields of the separate loops .",
    "therefore , we first consider a single loop lying parallel to the _ @xmath21 _ plane and centered with respect to the",
    "_ z_-axis of a cartesian coordinate system with a sphere at its origin , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "approximation of a toroidal inductor of small cross - section by a circular loop is considered in more detail in appendix 1 .",
    "the loop is supplied with an ac current with amplitude @xmath22 alternating harmonically with a circular frequency @xmath8 as @xmath23 .",
    "henceforth we use the magnetic diffusion time @xmath24 and the radius of the sphere @xmath4 as time and length scales while the current density and the vector potential are scaled by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we assume all quantities to be dimensionless with the same notation as for the dimensional counterparts used so far .",
    "further we consider the vector potential generated by the loop @xmath27 with the axisymmetric amplitude @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimensionless ac frequency which will be the main parameter throughout this paper .",
    "the amplitude of the current density of such a loop can be represented by using the dirac @xmath30 function : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the meridional angle and the spherical radius of the loop with respect to the center of the sphere as shown in fig .",

    "note that the solution ( [ eq : f0 ] ) alone could be obtained in a simpler way as in ref .",
    "our following analysis , however , is aimed at non - axisymmetric solutions which require a more complicated algebra .      consider a small displacement @xmath86 of the center of the sphere from the position @xmath87 to @xmath88 in the frame of reference related to the sphere , this corresponds to a perturbation of the external magnetic field @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 now the external field represents a superposition of the axisymmetric base field @xmath93 and a small but in general non - axisymmetric perturbation @xmath94 .",
    "the perturbation of the inner field @xmath95 is governed by the same eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a0-ex ] , [ eq : a0-in ] ) as the base field with the difference that now the external field is given by @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the perturbation of the inner field and the corresponding induced field outside the sphere can be obtained straightforwardly by replacing the coefficients @xmath96 by @xmath97 in the corresponding solutions ( [ eq : a0-insol ] , [ eq : a0-exsol ] ) for the base field .",
    "although the solution of the perturbed field obtained in such a way satisfies ( [ eq : a0-ex ] , [ eq : a0-in ] ) and the boundary conditions , it turns out that the induced field outside does not satisfy the coulomb gauge unless the problem is axisymmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ , the offset is along the symmetry axis .",
    "thus , although the laplace equation is satisfied we formally have @xmath98 which implies that the current is leaking outside the sphere . in addition note that the continuity of the tangential components of induction following from the continuity of the vector potential and its normal derivative at the surface of the sphere ensures continuity of the radial , _",
    "i.e. _ normal , component of the current because @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the vector potential satisfying the laplace equation and the coloumb gauge outside the sphere and being continuous at the surface ensures that the current is closed in the sphere .",
    "as shown above , the induced vector potential unambiguously follows from the imposed one .",
    "thus , the induced vector potential can be modified only by changing the imposed one .",

    "so , we obtain a set of free coefficients @xmath102 which can be chosen to satisfy the coulomb gauge for the induced field .",
    "this gauge transformation results in the replacement of the original coefficients @xmath97 by @xmath103 then , similarly to the base field , the perturbation of the induced field is obtained as @xmath104 from the coulomb gauge we find @xmath105 the corresponding induction is @xmath106.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to our previous theory @xcite , small - amplitude oscillations of the sphere with @xmath107 give rise to a perturbation of the force on the sphere @xmath108 = -\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{x}+\\vec{\\g}\\cdot\\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt}.\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the effective electromagnetic stiffness and damping tensors , respectively .",
    "further we refer to the elements of @xmath109 and @xmath111 as the spring constants and growth rates , respectively .",
    "note that due to the axial symmetry both @xmath109 and @xmath111 are purely diagonal matrices with zero azimuthal components . at first",
    ", the axial symmetry implies that a purely axial displacement gives rise to a similar reaction force .",
    "second , if the displacement is purely radial the reaction force , on the one hand , has to change to the opposite together with the displacement because of linearity but , on the other hand , it has to rotate around the symmetry axis together with the latter .",
    "thus , a purely radial displacement causes a purely radial reaction force and , therefore , both @xmath109 and @xmath111 are purely diagonal .",

    "the optimal distance becomes slightly larger ( see figs . [",

    "although the critical frequency for axial oscillations is , in general , slightly lower than that for the radial oscillations , there is no significant difference between both .",

    "spin - up instability occurs when the frequency of the alternating magnetic field exceeds the threshold @xmath179 defined above .",
    "the spin - up rate being proportional to @xmath207 becomes positive as the frequency raises over the threshold and attains a maximum at some higher frequency @xmath208 subsequently referred to as the most dangerous one .",
    "these critical frequencies together with the corresponding maximal spin - up rates for a sphere at the middle - point between symmetric and antisymmetric arrangements of two loops are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotz0 ] versus the half - distance between the loops of various radii . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotz0](_a _ ) , at large enough distances between the loops the threshold and the most dangerous frequencies tend to @xmath201 and @xmath202 in the symmetric arrangement , and to @xmath199 and @xmath200 in the antisymmetric one , which correspond to the spatially uniform and linear fields , respectively .",

    "fig : rotz0]_a _ on left ) .",

    "this work presents an analytic stability analysis of a solid sphere levitated electromagnetically in an axisymmetric magnetic field induced by a set of coaxial circular loops .",
    "stability is considered with respect to both oscillations of small amplitude and arbitrary direction and rotations perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the field . both oscillations and rotations",
    "are found to become growing in time when the dimensionless frequency of the field exceeds a certain critical threshold @xmath179 depending on the configuration of the field for each kind of instability .",
    "the growth rates of both instabilities become positive as the frequency is raised over the corresponding threshold , attain a maximum at some higher frequency and tend to zero at high frequencies .",
    "the frequency @xmath208 , at which the maximum is attained , is referred to as the most dangerous one for the corresponding instability .",
    "critical frequencies and the corresponding maximal growth rates are calculated for arrangements of two loops of the same radius carrying the same total current which may flow either in the same or in opposite directions . these arrangements , corresponding to the usual heating and positioning fields , are referred to as the symmetric and antisymmetric ones .",
    "it is found that critical frequencies for both oscillatory and rotational instabilities increase with the nonuniformity of the magnetic field .",
    "the lowest dimensionless critical frequencies are @xmath201 and @xmath202 which are the same for both the spin - up instability in a uniform magnetic field and the oscillatory instability in a spatially linear field . this coincidence represents a particular case of a more general rule : the critical frequencies for the spin - up instability in a spherically harmonic field of degree @xmath0 coincide with the critical frequencies for oscillatory instability in a spherically harmonic field of degree @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the critical frequencies @xmath199 and @xmath200 for the spin - up instability in a linear field coincide with the critical frequencies for the oscillatory instability in a spatially quadratic magnetic field which is the case at the mid - point of a symmetric arrangement of two loops except the case that the distance between the loops is equal to the radius of the loops . in this particular case ,",
    "the quadratic term vanishes and the instability is dominated by the fourth - order term which has critical frequencies @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "thus , the distance @xmath203 is optimal in order to avoid the oscillatory instability of the sphere at the mid - point of the symmetric arrangement .",
    "this distance , which ensures the most uniform magnetic field at the middle - point , yields a minimum of the critical frequency for the spin - up instability .",
    "note that there is no similar optimal distance for the oscillatory instability in antisymmetric arrangement where the critical frequency can be increased only by the nonuniformity of the magnetic field when the loops are approached close to the surface of the sphere .",
    "hence , the stabilization of a sphere by an optimal design of the inductor is rather limited and active means of stabilization , like an additional steady magnetic field , may be necessary .",
    "note that the maximal dimensionless growth rates for both oscillatory and spin - up instabilities are small , typically @xmath212 . from the physical point of view",
    "we have introduced the growth rate as a viscous - type friction coefficient at the velocity .",
    "thus the physical dimension of @xmath213 is @xmath214 and , consequently , its scale is @xmath215 because we have used the magnetic diffusion time @xmath216 and the radius of the sample @xmath4 as time and length scales , respectively . in order to obtain the actual friction force we have to take the product of velocity , friction coefficient and the magnitude of the characteristic total electromagnetic force @xmath217 which usually is comparable to the gravity of the sample @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the mass of the sample and @xmath220 the free fall acceleration . by comparing the negative effective friction force to the inertia",
    "we obtain an estimate of the characteristic growth time of the instability @xmath221 which for a characteristic size @xmath222 and a conductivity @xmath223 of the sample leads to @xmath224 .",
    "thus , although the magnetic field has a dynamically destabilizing effect , the development of the instability is expected to be very slow and , thus , hardly observable . in conclusion , note that the frequency of the magnetic field is the only parameter determining the threshold of dynamic instabilities as long as no external damping , for instance due to a surrounding gas , is taken into account . in the opposite case , the threshold of instability would depend not only on the frequency but also on the amplitude of the current .    in conclusion note that the dynamic instabilities resulting from the effect of motion of a conducting body in an ac magnetic field can be interpreted from an alternative physical point of view which can explain the weakness of this instability and also suggests other possible instability mechanisms . in the given ac magnetic field ,",
    "the electromagnetic force on the spherical body at rest depends only on its position .",
    "if the position changes , it takes some time for the electromagnetic force to relax to its time - averaged stationary value for the given position .",
    "this delay is caused by the finite time of magnetic diffusion in the body which , taking place over the skin depth , is thus comparable to the ac oscillation period @xmath225 the electromagnetic force at instant @xmath226 on the body in motion may be represented as @xmath227 assuming a sufficiently high ac frequency , we can expand this representation in a power series of small @xmath228 yielding @xmath229 thus , the delay of the magnetic field results in a force component proportional to the velocity which is obviously analogous to a viscous friction force . since for a statically stable position",
    "the effective electromagnetic reaction force @xmath230 is directed against the displacement @xmath86 , the effective friction force @xmath231 is directed with the motion .",
    "consequently , the delay of the magnetic field results in an effective electromagnetic friction force with a negative and , thus , destabilizing friction coefficient .",
    "it is important to note that the friction coefficient is small because it involves the delay time which is short and comparable to the ac period when the relaxation of the magnetic field is solely due to the electromagnetic diffusion over the skin depth .",
    "the same arguments may be extended to the coupling of the magnetic field and the temperature distribution in the body caused by its temperature - dependent electrical conductivity . in this case , the delay of the magnetic field would be dominated by the thermal relaxation time which is much longer than the electromagnetic diffusion time and , thus , expected to cause stronger dynamic instabilities than the pure electromagnetic mechanism considered here .",
    "in addition , the decrease of the electrical conductivity for increasing temperature , which is caused by the joule heating of the ac magnetic field , and the related reduction of the non - dimensional frequency @xmath161 might be important in levitation experiments .",
    "consider a toroidal inductor of arbitrary cross - section carrying an axisymmetric and purely azimuthal current .",
    "the magnetic field of such an inductor may be represented as a superposition of the fields of separate circular loops constituting the inductor , and the corresponding vector potential may be written as the integral over the inductor cross - section @xmath19 : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the nondimensionalized vector potential of a single circular loop defined by the radius vector @xmath234 with @xmath235 and @xmath137 being the radius and axial position of the loop in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "subsequently assume the skin effect to be negligible as if the inductor would be fed by a direct current driven by the gradient of an electrostatic potential @xmath236 an axisymmetric and purely azimuthal current distribution with density @xmath237 implies @xmath10 to depend solely on the azimuthal angle @xmath238 .",
    "consequently , @xmath239 where @xmath240 is a constant that can be related to the total current in the inductor @xmath241 and its effective radius @xmath242 as @xmath243 further we assume the inductor cross - section to be located about some position @xmath244 which will be specified later , and approximate the field distribution by the following multipole type expansion : @xmath245\\frac{ds'd\\phi'}{\\left|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_{0}\\right| } , \\label{eq : multexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath246 acts on @xmath247 now , if we define @xmath52 as the position of the mass center of the cross - section @xmath248 the second dipole - like term cancels in the expression above which , thus , reduces to    @xmath249    the last expression defines the vector potential of a circular loop located at @xmath52 and carrying the effective current @xmath250 for example , in the case of an inductor represented by a torus with major and minor radii @xmath33 and @xmath251 the effective radius can easily be found from ( [ eq : effr ] ) as @xmath252 while the mass center of the cross - section coincides with its geometrical center .",
    "note that the solution ( [ eq : a_approx ] ) is accurate up to the quadrapole - like term neglected in ( [ eq : multexp ] ) the magnitude of which relative to the remaining term may be estimated as @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the characteristic size of the cross - section and @xmath4 is the characteristic distance to the cross - section center .",
    "obviously , the neglected term becomes significant only at distances comparable to @xmath255",
    "similarly to ref . @xcite we also use a complex unity vector @xmath258 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding cartesian unit vectors , and employ the outer and inner solutions of the scalar laplace equation , @xmath259 and @xmath260 associated with the spherical harmonic @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "these variables provide a simple algebra for calculation of the gradient operator @xmath262 used throughout this study : @xmath263 where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate and @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding relations for the complex conjugate functions follow straightforwardly from the above relations and the property of spherical harmonics : @xmath264 another relation used for the calculation of the torque in sec .",
    "3 is : @xmath265.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that our definition of @xmath266 is slightly different from that used in @xcite leading to a bit more complicated algebra but simpler resulting expressions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath268 and @xmath269 in ( [ eq : f0],[eq : gamma ] , [ eq : dm ] ) can efficiently be calculated using continued fractions @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we rewrite @xmath270 where @xmath271 and @xmath272 is the spherical bessel function of index @xmath273 further , applying a recurrence relation for the spherical bessel function of index @xmath0 + 1 we obtain the continued fraction : @xmath274 allowing us to calculate @xmath275 provided that @xmath276 is known .",
    "but asymptotic properties of bessel functions suggest that for large index @xmath0 @xmath277 .",
    "thus for any @xmath136 we can choose sufficiently large @xmath278 and then truncate the fraction by approximating @xmath279 by the previous expression that allows us to calculate back the necessary @xmath280 note that the forward recurrence for @xmath275 is not practically applicable because it is numerically unstable similarly to its counterpart for bessel functions .",
    "the other necessary quantity @xmath281 contained in ( [ eq : gamma],[eq : dm ] ) , can be calculated in a similar way by expressing it as @xmath282 .",
