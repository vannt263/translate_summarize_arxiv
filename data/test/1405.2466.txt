    "in this article we study the asymptotics of large directed graphs with constrained densities of edges and outward directed @xmath0-stars .",
    "large graphs are often modeled by probabilistic ensembles with one or more adjustable parameters ; see e.g. fienberg  @xcite , lovsz  @xcite and newman  @xcite . the _ exponential random graph models _ ( ergms ) , in which parameters are used to tune the densities of edges and other subgraphs , are one such class of models ; see e.g. besag @xcite , frank and strauss  @xcite , holland and leinhardt @xcite , newman  @xcite , rinaldo et al .",
    "@xcite , robins et al .",
    "@xcite , snijders et al .",
    "@xcite , strauss @xcite , and wasserman and faust  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in many ergms the subgraph densities actually _ can not _ be tuned .",
    "for example , for the class of ergms parametrized by edges and @xmath0-stars , large graphs are essentially erds - rnyi for all values of the parameters .",
    "( see chatterjee and diaconis  @xcite for more complete and precise statements . )",
    "an alternative to ergms was introduced by radin and sadun  @xcite , where instead of using parameters to control subgraph counts , the subgraph densities are controlled directly ; see also radin et al .",
    "@xcite , radin and sadun  @xcite and kenyon et al .",
    "this is the approach we take in this article , with edges and ( outward ) @xmath0-stars as the subgraphs controlled directly .",
    "we also consider models which split the difference between the two approaches : edges ( resp .",
    "@xmath0-stars ) are controlled directly , while @xmath0-stars ( resp .",
    "edges ) are tuned with a parameter .",
    "see  @xcite for the undirected graph version of the latter .",
    "we find that , in all our models , graphs have either uniform or bipodal structure as the number of nodes becomes infinite .",
    "our approach , following refs .",
    "@xcite , is to study maximizers of the entropy or free energy of the model as the number of nodes becomes infinite .",
    "when we constrain both edge and @xmath0-star densities , we find only bipodal structure ( except when the @xmath0-star density is fixed to be exactly equal to the @xmath0th power of the edge density ) . when we constrain either edge or @xmath0-star densities ( but not both ) , we find both uniform and bipodal structures , with a sharp change at the interface .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation in the ergm version of the model , in which one finds only uniform structures , albeit with sharp changes in their densities along a certain curve in parameter space ; see aristoff and zhu  @xcite .",
    "these sharp changes along interfaces are called _",
    "phase transitions_. phase transitions have recently been proved rigorously for ergms ; see e.g. yin  @xcite and especially radin and yin  @xcite for a precise definition of the term . some earlier works using mean - field analysis and",
    "other approximations include hggstrm and jonasson  @xcite and park and newman  @xcite .",
    "the terminology is apt , in that ergms and our models are inspired by certain counterparts in statistical physics : respectively , the _ grand canonical ensemble _ , and the _ microcanonical _ and _ canonical ensembles_. see the discussion in section  [ models ] .",
    "our directed graph models are simpler than their undirected counterparts .",
    "in particular , we can rigorously identify the asymptotic structures at all parameters , while in analogous models for undirected graphs , only partial results are known  @xcite . our analysis , however , does not easily extend to directed random graph models where other subgraphs , like triangles , cycles , etc .",
    ", instead of outward directed @xmath0-stars , are constrained .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ models ] , we describe our models and compare them with their statistical physics counterparts . in section  [ results ] , we state our main results . in section  [ ldp ] , we prove a large deviations principle for edge and @xmath0-star densities .",
    "we use the large deviations principle to give proofs , in section  [ proofs ] , of our main results .",
    "a directed graph on @xmath1 nodes will be represented by a matrix @xmath2 , where @xmath3 if there is a directed edge from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 , and @xmath6 otherwise . for simplicity , we allow for @xmath7 , though this will not affect our results . let @xmath8 ( resp .",

    "see radin and yin  @xcite for similar results , which use a similar variational characterization , in the undirected graph setting .",
    "the results in  @xcite and  @xcite will be useful in our analysis .",
    "this is because the euler - lagrange equations associated with the variational formulas for  ,   are the same as the analogous variational formula for  .",
    "the crucial difference in the optimization problems is that for the ergm , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fixed parameters , while in our models one or both of @xmath44 is a free variable ( i.e. , a lagrange multiplier ) .",
    "thus , some solutions to the ergm variational problem may have no relevance to our models .",
