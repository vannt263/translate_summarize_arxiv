    "coexistence of two or more order parameters in solids is one of the most intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics .",
    "there are many systems where the ordered phases are even antagonistic to each other . nowadays ,",
    "a very popular subject of research are compounds with coexisting superconducting ( sc ) and magnetic ( m ) order parameters .",
    "it is already well known , that the exchange field responsible for ferromagnetism destroys singlet cooper pairs @xcite but can generate @xcite triplet ones ( odd in frequency and symmetric in space ) that survives even in the presence of a strong exchange field and strong impurity scattering .",
    "the theoretical prediction has been recently confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a magnetic order of the antiferromagnetic type can coexist with singlet cooper pairs because the average magnetic moment ( on distances of order of the size of the cooper pairs ) is close to zero .",
    "this case is realized in superconductors with a spiral magnetic structure ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another example of this coexistence are superconductors with a spin - density wave ( sdw ) @xcite .",
    "this type of superconductivity coexisting with the sdw is realized in quasi - one - dimensional conductors ( for a review , see @xcite ) . a lot of attention",
    "is payed now to quasi - two - dimensional superconducting compounds  the so - called fe - based pnictides  discovered recently @xcite .",
    "some of these fe - based superconductors have rather high critical temperature @xmath9 of the superconducting transition ( up to 56 k observed in @xmath10 at the doping level @xmath11 @xcite ) and have much in common with the high @xmath9 cuprates ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been established , both theoretically and experimentally , that at a certain critical temperature @xmath12 ( usually @xmath13 ) the compounds undergo a magnetic transition leading to the formation of a sdw . in a certain interval of the temperature and doping level @xmath14 the sc and m order parameters",
    "may coexist @xcite .",
    "the sdw in pnictides arises due to the nesting of the electron and hole pockets @xcite .",
    "each pocket has its own sc order parameter , @xmath15 resp .",
    "@xmath16 , but the most energetically favorable state corresponds to the so - called @xmath17-pairing , characterized by the opposite signs of the sc order parameters : @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "microscopic theories for the electronic states in materials with the superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters are mainly based on the equations for the green s functions @xmath19 which include both normal and anomalous ones corresponding to the sc and m order parameters @xcite .",
    "these equations are written in the mean field approximation in an analogy with the ordinary superconductors without specifying the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity and were solved under some approximations mostly in spatially homogenous case . on the other hand ,",
    "several research groups have begun to study pnictides in nonhomogeneous structures .",
    "for examples , the results concerning josephson effects in junctions based on pnictides have been published recently @xcite . the josephson effect in tunnel @xmath20 junctions ( @xmath21 denotes an insulator ) consisting of",
    "the of multiband superconductors can be investigated on the basis of the tunnel hamiltonian and the equations for the green s functions @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is not applicable to other types of the josephson junctions .    in order to tackle the problems in nonhomogeneous cases",
    "it is much more convenient to employ the widely used quasiclassical approach based on using the so - called quasiclassical green s functions @xmath22 .",
    "these functions are obtained from the full green s functions @xmath19 by integration over the modulus of the momentum @xmath23 in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "the quasiclassical green s functions @xmath22 are used in situations when the parameters characterizing the system vary on the distances exceeding the fermi wave length @xmath24 .",
    "the method of quasiclassical green s functions has been developed in the theory of superconductivity @xcite and turned out to be the most powerful and effective tool in dealing with the problems in nonuniform cases : vortices in superconductors , proximity effect in superconductor / normal metal structures , etc .",
    "the equations for the quasiclassical green s functions can be generalized to the case of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) @xcite and two - band superconductors @xcite .",
    "they are very efficient for describing superconductors in contact with ferromagnets @xcite .    at the same time , corresponding equations for the case of a two - band superconductor with the sdw are still lacking , although such equations can be derived under certain restrictions .",
    "deriving these equations is very important because they can serve for the description of the superconductors like fe - based pnictides .",
    "the quasiclassical approximation is well justified for describing the pnictides because the correlation lengths for both the superconducting and the magnetic correlations @xmath25 are much longer than the fermi wave length , where @xmath26 is a characteristic energy related to the magnetic order .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the equations for the quasiclassical matrix green s function @xmath0 that describe a two - band superconductor with the sdw .",
    "these equations can be applied both to equilibrium and nonequilibrium states in homogeneous and nonhomogeneous cases and describe a broad class of phenomena in superconductors like fe - based pnictides .",
    "we employ these equations to analyse the knight shift , the proximity and the dc josephson effect in such superconductors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we write the hamiltonian of the system in the mean - field approximation in terms of the operators suitable for deriving the equations for the quasiclassical green s functions .",
    "these equations are derived in sec .",
    "iii in the ballistic limit .",
    "we also present formulas for the observable quantities such as the sc and m order parameters ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , as well as for the charge and spin current density . in sec .",
    "iv we study the knight shift , i.e.  the shift of the nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) frequency due to the spin polarization of the s - electrons , for different orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the direction of the magnetization @xmath29 in the sdw . in sec .",
    "v the proximity effect will be analyzed in the vicinity of the interface between a superconductor with the sdw and a nonsuperconducting material ( with or without sdw ) . using a simple model , in sec .",
    "vi we calculate the dc josephson ( @xmath30 ) and the spin ( @xmath31 ) current in the josephson @xmath2 junction , where @xmath4 denotes a superconductor with an sdw , and @xmath32 is a normal metal .",
    "the obtained results will be discussed in sec .",
    "we consider a simple model of a two band superconductor with such a fermi surface that not only the superconducting but also an sdw pairing is possible .",
    "the sdw pairing may originate from the nesting of certain parts of the fermi surface and we assume that such parts exist .    in such a situation one can have logarithmic contribution not only from the cooper channel but also from the particle - hole one .",
    "solving this problem microscopically is not easy because one should perform rather complicated renormalization group calculations in order to get the information about non - trivial phases at low temperature .",
    "we do not intend to discuss here microscopic mechanisms of the superconductivity and its competition with the sdw .",
    "our goal is more modest : assuming that the superconductivity and the sdw coexist we consider them in the mean field approximation . in principle",
    ", one could obtain physical quantities of interest using the normal and anomalous electron green s functions written in the presence of the superconducting and sdw order parameters @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , if the system is not homogeneous , solving the equations for the electron green s functions is not easy and therefore we develop the formalism of quasiclassical green s functions @xmath22 taking into account both the superconducting and the sdw order parameters .",
    "these equations are obtained as a result of a certain simplification of the original equations for the electron green s functions .",
