    "the texox-1000 ( toot ) radio source ( rs ) survey is an ambitious collaboration between texas and oxford universities to assemble the largest sample of rs , in order to probe typical radio - loud active galaxies to high redshift .",
    "the toot survey has made use of uk and texas facilities to identify and measure the redshifts of a large sample drawn from the low - frequency 7c survey with s@xmath2@xmath30.1 jy .",
    "it is already the largest rs redshift survey in existence that extends to high redshift and is unbiased by optical selection criteria .",
    "1 shows the radio - luminosity ( l@xmath4 ) versus redshift diagram for various complete low - frequency rs redshift surveys , including toot .",
    "selection at low frequency is essential in order to avoid orientation - dependent beaming effects that distort the source counts at high frequency .",
    "the 3crr @xcite , 6ce @xcite , and 7crs @xcite surveys have a total of 356 rs , but still suffer from small number statistics and the fact that even the 7crs does not reach the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) break at z@xmath31 . as a result , there is still controversy about the form of the rlf evolution at high redshift , specifically whether there is a cut - off beyond z=2 @xcite .",
    "the toot survey on the other hand probes low - enough l@xmath4 at high redshift , and is sufficiently large , to resolve the form of the radio source population ( rsp ) evolution . even at high redshift",
    ", toot contains objects with l@xmath4 typical of 3cr galaxies at z@xmath10.3 , allowing direct comparison of properties as a function of redshift without the usual problems of the redshift - luminosity degeneracy .",
    "the lower flux - density lbds survey @xcite misses the bulk of the luminosity density at all redshifts , and is dominated by very low l@xmath4 rs .",
    "the toot survey is the realisation of a survey proposed by willott _",
    "( 2001 , w01 @xcite ) , and it has several key aims :    * probe the existence of a redshift cutoff for the high - luminosity sources at z@xmath32",
    ". we will be able to finally get away from small number statistics and measure the magnitude of any high-@xmath5 space density decline .",
    "* establish whether the low - luminosity population evolves at all . at present",
    "we can not discriminate reliably between constant space density and a rise by an order - of - magnitude : toot will establish the evolution to @xmath6 dex . * probe large scale structure .",
    "steep spectrum rs are ideal sparse tracers of lss , having high bias and being easy to observe over large volumes @xcite .",
    "toot is the first survey to study the sources responsible for the bulk of the radio - luminosity density of the universe at high redshift ( between the horizontal dotted lines in fig .",
    "they are typical in the same sense that l@xmath0 galaxies are typical of galaxies in the optical .",
    "higher - l@xmath4 rs are too rare to be important sources of energy input in the evolution of galaxies , as the rlf is steep .",
    "radio source jet energy is coupled efficiently to the gas in the ism and icm and _ may _ account for @xmath110% of the thermal energy of hot gas in clusters , a significant fraction of the total @xcite .",
    "the injection of jet energy may also influence surrounding galaxies by heating the gas in the cluster environment .",
    "study of the rs responsible for the radio luminosity density of the universe is hence of great interest .    at the toot flux - density limit",
    ", the rsp divides about equally into low- and high - luminosity sources . the low - l@xmath4 rs ( below log(l@xmath4)=26 whz@xmath7sr@xmath7 in fig .",
    "1 ) do not show emission lines and have both fri and frii morphology , while the high - l@xmath4 ones have emission lines and frii morphology .",
    "in toot we trace the low - l@xmath4 population to z@xmath12 .",
    "w01 have found a good fit to the rsp evolution for s@xmath4@xmath30.5 jy by combining a strongly evolving high - l@xmath4 population with a moderately evolving low - l@xmath4 population .",
    "toot can directly test the predictions of such models .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have progressed , we have endeavoured to obtain completeness in sub - regions of the survey ( toot00 , 08 , 12 , and 18 , see table 2 ) , and now have spectroscopy for half the sample . obviously , a fraction of the redshifts will be unreliable or spurious @xmath8 it is an unavoidable feature of such studies .",
    "the significantly smaller 6c and 7crs surveys have achieved @xmath390% reliable redshifts .",
    "we estimate that we have reliable redshifts for 70 - 80% of the sample , with most of the unreliable@xmath9spurious ones associated with objects in the 0.6@xmath10z@xmath101.6 redshift range , where most of the galaxies do not show emission lines , and are faint , resulting in poor s@xmath9n ratio . as the het continues to improve in performance",
    ", we will increase the completeness for this part of the sample , as large aperture is needed for these observations . at z@xmath31.6 , most objects have sufficiently high l@xmath4 to show emission lines . here the ambiguities center on objects with single - line redshifts , but k - band photometry ensures that alternative line ids can usually be ruled out reliably .",
    "we are continuing to obtain k - band imaging to improve redshift estimates for the faintest objects .",
    "2 shows the redshift distribution for 442 sources in the complete toot00s , 08 , and 12 , fields .",
    "the @xmath130 sources without spectroscopy are not shown .",
    "the median redshift is z=1 .",
    "the w01 model c , with an intermediate high - redshift drop - off , computed for @xmath11=0.7 , @xmath12=0.3 cosmology is overplotted at appropriate normalisation , for comparison",
    ". the double - peaked shape of the model prediction is due to the inflexion in the rlf between the two populations . the first conclusion from fig .",
    "2 is that the toot survey has been worthwhile : the model predictions are close to the observations for z@xmath101 , but differ significantly at z@xmath32 .",
    "it is difficult to simply ascribe the disagreement to spurious / incomplete redshifts as there are too few objects without redshifts , and we do not expect spurious redshifts for z@xmath31.6 , as long as the objects show emission lines .",
    "however , it is possible that the faint red radio galaxy population , for which redshifts will be most unreliable , contains examples of highly - reddened radio galaxies ( eros @xcite ) that should be at z@xmath32 , but are erroneously ascribed lower redshifts . in order to fully account for the discrepancy , the eros would be 20% of the sample .",
    "this is higher than the 8% found in the 7crs , for example @xcite , and it seems unlikely that we would have just missed those with 2@xmath10z@xmath103 .",
    "indeed , the 7crs eros all lie between 1@xmath10z@xmath102 .",
    "on the other hand , our investigation of the properties of toot and 7crs rs at z@xmath13 @xcite indicates that they are all reddened quasars , so a significant fraction of reddened , faint rs might be expected . with the current state of the spectroscopy we can not rule out a significant population of eros in toot at z@xmath12 - 3 , particularly as these objects have similar l@xmath4 to the lower - redshift 7crs eros . at",
    "higher redshift , the agreement with the w01 model c is quite good , indicating that any high - redshift cutoff is gradual .",
    "the factor of 10 increase in the space density of the low - l@xmath4 population to z@xmath11 in the w01 models appears to give a good qualitative match to n(z ) for z@xmath101.5 .",
    "we will be comparing the results from toot to other models @xcite as we progress .",
