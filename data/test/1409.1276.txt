    "the interaction of fluid / fluid interfaces with solid boundaries is of fundamental importance to a variety of wetting and dewetting phenomena . in this paper , we present a computational framework for the inclusion of a general fluid / solid interaction , treated as a temporally and spatially dependent body force , in a direct solver of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this approach allows for computing fluid wetting properties ( such as equilibrium contact angle ) based on first principles , and without restriction to small contact angles .    due to the complexities involved in modeling dynamics of fluids on solid substrates ,",
    "a significant amount of modeling and computational work has been carried out using the long - wave ( lubrication ) approach .",
    "still , even within the long - wave approach , a difficulty arises when employing the commonly used no - slip boundary condition at the fluid / solid interface : a non - integrable shear - stress singularity at the moving contact line . simulating dynamic contact lines therefore requires additional ingredients for the model .",
    "one option is to include fluid / solid interaction forces with conjoining - disjoining terms which lead to a prewetted ( often called ` precursor ' ) layer in nominally ` dry ' regions .",
    "this approach effectively removes the ` true ' contact line , consequently avoiding the associated singularity  @xcite .",
    "a second approach is to relax the no - slip condition and instead assume the presence of slip at the fluid / solid interface .",
    "both slip and disjoining pressure approaches have been extensively used to model a variety of problems including wetting , dewetting , film breakup , and many others ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews ) .    while the approach based on the long - wave model has been very successful , it does include limitations inherent in its formulation : in particular , the restriction to small interfacial slopes ( strictly speaking , the slopes much less than unity ) , and therefore small contact angles . we have shown in our earlier work  @xcite that ,",
    "depending on the choice of flow geometry , the comparison between the solutions of the long - wave model and of the navier - stokes equations may be better than expected ; however , still for slopes of @xmath0 , quantitative agreement disappears .",
    "therefore , one would like to be able to consider wetting / dewetting problems by working outside of the long - wave limit , while still considering the most important physical effects ; such as fluid / solid interaction forces .",
    "these fluid / solid interactions are known to be crucial in determining stability properties of a fluid film ; without their presence , a fluid film on a substrate is stable , since there are no forces in the model to destabilize it . in particular , for thin nanoscale films , fluid / solid interaction forces may be dominant .",
    "we note that the approaches based on the derjaguin approximation to include the van der waals or electrostatic interactions into the model in the form of a local pressure contribution ( disjoining pressure ) acting on the fluid / solid interface are derived under the assumption of a flat film  @xcite .",
    "therefore these approaches can not be trivially extended to the configurations involving large contact angles .    in the context of direct simulations of the navier - stokes equations with free interfaces , a large variety of methods",
    "are used to track the evolution of the interface .",
    "lagrangian methods conform the computational grid to the interface ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "eulerian methods require a separate mechanism to track the interface location ; these include front tracking methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and interface capturing methods such as volume of fluid methods and level set methods .",
    "the latter two methods easily treat topology changes , and with recent developments have been shown to be effective for simulating surface tension driven flows  @xcite",
    ". a common feature of volume of fluid methods is that contact angles are imposed geometrically , in that the angle at which the interface intersects the solid substrate is specified as a boundary condition on the interface  @xcite .",
    "such approaches were used to model the dynamics of non - wetting drops , that could even detach from the substrate  @xcite , as well as spreading drops  @xcite .",
    "the van der waals interaction has been implemented previously in a volume of fluid based solver for the liquid / liquid interaction of colliding droplets  @xcite , but to our knowledge has not been considered for flows involving wetting phenomena .",
    "a variety of other computational methods have been considered in the context of wetting / dewetting . here",
    "we mention phase - field methods that treat two fluids with a diffuse interface by means of a smooth concentration function , which typically satisfies the cahn - hilliard or allen - cahn equations , and is coupled to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "jacqmin  @xcite describes a phase - field contact angle model that use a wall energy to determine the value of the normal derivative of the concentration on a solid substrate .",
    "this model has been used to study contact line dynamics  @xcite , and similar models have been considered in the investigation of the sharp interface limit of the diffuse interface model  @xcite .",
    "lattice - boltzmann methods have also treated the contact angle with a wall energy contribution  @xcite .",
    "these approaches have explained a variety of phenomena related to spreading of fluids on solid substrates , but do not consider explicitly the stabilizing and destabilizing forces between fluid and solid , as has been done via disjoining pressure within the context of the long - wave model . the liquid / solid interaction is naturally included in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite that typically consider lennard jones potential between fluid and solid particles .",
    "however , md simulations are , in general , computationally expensive , even when simulating nanoscale systems .",
    "one would like to be able to include liquid - solid interaction within the framework of a continuum model .    here , we present a novel approach , based on a volume of fluid formulation , which includes the fluid / solid interaction forces into the governing navier - stokes equations , without limitations inherent in the long - wave model .",
    "this inclusion allows for arbitrary contact angles to be incorporated based on modeling the underlying physics , in contrast to conventional volume of fluid methods .",
    "the presented approach also leads to the regularization of the viscous stress since the fluid film thickness never becomes zero .",
    "furthermore , our framework can account for additional physical effects , such as instability and breakup of thin fluid films , that would not be described if fluid / solid interaction forces were not explicitly included .",
    "we note here that while film rupture can also occur in phase - field based approaches ( as in  @xcite ) , this seems to be due to the presence of a rather thick interface , and not due to the explicit inclusion of destabilizing liquid / solid interaction forces .    in the present paper we focus on formulating and discretizing the model , and on discussing issues related to convergence and accuracy . to validate our proposed numerical scheme , we consider two representative examples , involving relaxation and spreading of sessile drops with various contact angles on a substrate .",
    "these benchmark cases permit comparison of our results with well established analytical solutions for a particular flow regime .",
    "the application of the method to the study of thin film stability including dewetting will be considered in the sequel  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the details of the fluid / solid interaction in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we describe two finite - volume methods for the discretization of the considered fluid / solid interaction forces .",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we give an overview and future outlook .",
    "consider a perfectly flat solid substrate covered by two immiscible fluids . for clarity , we will refer to these fluids as the liquid phase ( subscript @xmath1 ) , and the vapor phase ( subscript @xmath2 ) , although the present formulation applies to any two fluids .",
    "assume that gravity can be neglected , and also ignore any phase - change effects , such as evaporation and condensation .",
    "there are three relevant interfacial energies : the liquid / solid , @xmath3 , the vapor / solid , @xmath4 , and the liquid / vapor , @xmath5 , energies .",
    "the contact angle is commonly defined as the angle between the tangent plane of the interface between the liquid and vapor phases and the solid substrate at the point where the interface meets the surface . at equilibrium ,",
    "the contact angle , @xmath6 , and the surface energies are related by young s equation  @xcite : @xmath7 if there is a nonzero contact angle at equilibrium , the liquid partially wets the solid surface ; if the equilibrium configuration is a flat layer covering the whole substrate , then it fully wets the solid surface .",
    "it is also possible for the liquid to be non - wetting , where the liquid beads up into a sphere on the surface .",
    "the wetting behavior of the system can be characterized by the equilibrium spreading coefficient , defined by : @xmath8 which expresses the difference in energy per unit area between a surface with no liquid , and one with a layer of liquid ( what we call ` dry ' and ` wet ' states , respectively ) .",
    "wetting is determined by the sign of @xmath9 ; partial wetting occurs for @xmath10 , and complete wetting for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the above characterization of the contact angle is straightforward for static configurations and at macroscopic length scales .",
    "if these assumptions are not satisfied , definitions of contact angles become more complex . in the literature",
    ", a distinction is made between the apparent contact angle , @xmath12 , and the microscopic contact angle , @xmath13 , distinguished by the distance from the contact line at which the measurement is made  @xcite .",
    "the contact angle resulting from measuring on macroscopic length scales is @xmath12 , while @xmath13 is measured at short length scales which are still long enough so that the continuum limit is appropriate  @xcite . the microscopic contact angle , @xmath13 , is often identified with @xmath6 , which is commonly used in the derivation of spreading laws , such as the classical cox - voinov law  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the details of the fluid behavior on nano scales in the vicinity of the fluid fronts and associated contact lines are far from being completely understood  @xcite , and the way in which the contact angle arises at small scales is a subject of ongoing research  @xcite .",
    "the surface energies entering eq .   and eq .   arise due to the van der waals interaction between the different phases that are relevant on short length scales .",
    "three kinds of van der waals interactions are usually considered : interactions between polar molecules , interaction of molecules that have an induced polarization , and the dispersion forces  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion interaction is relevant for all molecules , and will be the only one that we consider . a common model for approximating the dispersion interaction of two particles , of phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 , centered at at @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the 12 - 6 lennard jones potential  @xcite : @xmath18 this potential has a minimum , @xmath19 , at @xmath20 , and for simplicity we assume that @xmath21 is a constant for any two interacting particles .",
    "the center distance between the two particles is given by : @xmath22 the powers @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "correspond to short range repulsion and long range attraction , respectively . for our purposes",
    ", we generalize this formulation and use the following form : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the scale of the potential well , having units of energy per particle pair interaction . in general , we require only that @xmath27 are integers , such that @xmath28 , for reasons that will become clear shortly .",
    "our model considers two fluid phases , a liquid phase and a vapor phase occupying the region @xmath29 , interacting with a flat , half infinite , solid substrate ( subscript @xmath30 ) in the region @xmath31 .",
    "consider now a particle located at @xmath32 of phase @xmath14 ( where @xmath14 is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) .",
