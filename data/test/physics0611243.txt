    "the dynamics of a non - equilibrium system often results in highly complicated domain structures ( microstructures ) .",
    "typically , as time proceeds , the average size of these structures grows as a direct consequence of free - energy reduction : the interface is eliminated resulting in an increase in the size of homogeneous regions .",
    "traditional non - equilibrium dynamics usually deals with the equilibrium states that are spatially uniform @xcite , i.e. , the stable phases are characterized by homogeneous values for the appropriate intensive thermodynamic variables .",
    "classic , albeit quite simple , examples of models governing the evolution of such systems are the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation for conserved systems @xcite and allen - cahn ( ac ) equation for non - conserved systems @xcite .",
    "examples are found in polymer mixtures @xcite , alloys @xcite , liquid - crystals @xcite , and in cosmology @xcite .",
    "a model that has generated considerable recent interest is the phase field crystal ( pfc ) equation @xcite , which is a conservative form of the familiar , non - conserved , swift - hohenberg ( sh ) equation @xcite .",
    "these systems differ from the ch and ac systems in that the stable phase is periodic . for sh models ,",
    "the order parameter is viewed as capturing the inhomogeneities in a fluid associated with rayleigh - bnard convection . in the case of the pfc model , which is a simple version of more elaborate density functional theories of liquid / crystal interfaces @xcite",
    ", the model captures features at the atomic scale , and thus contains highly detailed physical information about the system s structure .",
    "such models can describe many of the basic properties of polycrystalline materials that are realized during non - equilibrium processing .",
    "the equations of motion governing these non - equilibrium phenomena are non - linear partial differential equations that can not generally be solved analytically for random initial conditions .",
    "therefore , computer simulations play an essential role in our understanding and characterization of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "the standard euler integration is known to be unstable for time step @xmath0 above a threshold fixed by lattice spacing @xmath1 @xcite . in ch and ac systems , to maintain an interfacial profile , the lattice spacing must be smaller than the interfacial width @xmath2 , and in pfc and sh systems , @xmath1 must smaller than the periodicity selected by the system .",
    "thus , the euler update is inefficient , and in practice it is computationally costly to use to evolve large systems .",
    "various computational algorithms @xcite have been developed by increasing @xmath3 compared to the simplest euler discretization .",
    "however , these methods still require a fixed time step , so they eventually become inefficient .",
    "recently , unconditionally stable algorithms @xcite were developed to overcome this difficulty for ch and ac equations .",
    "these algorithms are a class of stable algorithms free of the fixed time step constraint for equations with a mix of implicit and explicit terms .",
    "while these algorithms allow for an increasing time step in ch systems as time proceeds , only a finite effective time step is possible for ac systems .",
    "a recent study @xcite , based on this unconditionally stable algorithm , demonstrated analytically that one can use an accelerated algorithm @xmath4 to drive the ch equation , with the accuracy in correlation controlled by @xmath5 .    in this manuscript",
    "we apply this unconditionally stable algorithm to the pfc and sh equations ( section @xmath6 ) . in section",
    "@xmath7 we establish the effectiveness of this approach through numerical studies of the algorithm , demonstrating that the algorithm is both efficient and accurate for solving pfc equation .",
    "finally , in section @xmath8 we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we develop a class of unconditionally stable time stepping algorithms ( @xmath3 taken arbitrarily large without the solution becoming unstable ) to the pfc and sh equations .",
    "although the main purpose of this section is to study unconditionally stable algorithms for the pfc equation , we include a parallel discussion of the sh equation , as the methodology applies to both equations with only trivial differences .",
    "both the pfc and sh equations start from a free energy functional that describes the configurational cost of periodic phases in contact with isotropic phases , and can be expressed as @xmath9=\\int d\\vx \\left\\{\\frac{1}{2 } \\phi\\left[r + ( 1 + \\nabla^2)^2\\right]\\phi   + \\frac{\\phi^4}{4}\\right\\ } ,          \\label{eq : pfcbasic}\\ ] ] where the periodic order parameter @xmath10 has the wave number @xmath11 in equilibrium , and @xmath12 characterizes the quench depth .",

    "when @xmath74 , the ratio of the number of time steps needed to achieve a particular energy using the unconditionally stable versus euler algorithm is approximately @xmath105 ( the ratio of the dominant mode effective time step to the euler time step ) .",
    "this is a substantial speedup , and requires minimal analysis to implement the technique .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an unconditionally stable algorithm applicable to finite difference solutions of the the pfc equation . we have demonstrated that a fixed algorithmic time step driving scheme may provide significant speedup , with a controlled level of accuracy , when compared with euler algorithm . for the representative parameters chosen , a speedup of a factor of 180 was obtained .",
    "the analytical results and the numerical results are consistent with an effective time step analysis .",
    "although this algorithm allows arbitrarily large algorithmic time steps , caution is indicated , as taking too large an algorithmic time step will yield inaccuracies with little improvement in the overall speedup of the calculation .",
    "this saturation in the speedup results from the details of how the system s energy evolution ( and its corresponding microstructural evolution ) is governed by the effective time step , which saturates as the algorithmic time step increases .",
    "thus , there is little advantage in too large an algorithmic time step .",
    "a method for obtaining a reasonable value for the algorithmic time step @xmath3 is suggested , in which a few test cases are run with different values of @xmath3 to see which one offers a good speedup and maintains the desired accuracy .",
    "the analytic form of the effective time step provides a useful guide for deciding how large a time step to select when trading off the obtainable speedup versus the loss of accuracy .",
    "we expect the methodology developed in this paper could find extensive applications in a wide class of non - equilibrium systems .",
    "for example , it can be straightforwardly applied to the swift - hohenberg equation , given its similarity with the phase field crystal model .",
    "additionally , the method also will apply to systems where there is a dominant mode realized at late times , such as is found in diblock co - polymers .",
    "this method should allow researchers to dramatically improve the computational efficiency associated with modeling the dynamics of materials systems .",
