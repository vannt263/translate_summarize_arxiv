    "x - rays have been an essential probe to study energetic astrophysical phenomena , including mass accretion onto black holes in particular . starting with the first identification of cygnus x-1 ( hereafter cyg x-1 ) as a black hole binary in the early 1970 s ( e.g. , @xcite , tananbaum et al .  1972 , @xcite ) ,",
    "the spectral as well as timing studies of black hole binaries , including cyg x-1 , have established the presence of two distinct states : the high / soft state and the low / hard state ( e.g. , , done et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in the high / soft state , an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk releases most of the gravitational energy in locally thermal equilibrium radiation .",
    "the spectra in this state can be fairly well reproduced by multi - color blackbody radiation ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 and makishima et al .  1986 ) from such a `` standard '' accretion disk and a powerlaw emission with a photon index of @xmath2 of which the origin is commonly considered to be compton scattering by a disk corona with a hybrid ( thermal + non - thermal ) electron distribution ( e.g. , @xcite , gierliski  et al .  1999 , and @xcite ) , along with reflection features arising from disk regions illuminated by the powerlaw component .",
    "a typical high / soft state spectrum from cyg x-1 is shown as black in figure [ suzakuspec ] .    in the low / hard state ,",
    "the spectrum is no longer dominated by the disk emission . instead ,",
    "most of the energy is released in hard x - rays via un - saturated comptonization by maxwellian electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this comptonizing region , conventionally called a `` corona '' , is hot ( with a typical temperature of @xmath1 100  kev , possibly with a much higher ion temperature , so most probably geometrically thick ) , and optically thin , in marked contrast to the standard disk which is cool , geometrically thin and optically thick .",
    "however , some optically thick material is still present in this state : there is a weak thermal component seen in the soft x - ray bandpass which presumably provides seed photons for the comptonization , and there is clear evidence for some reflected emission ( iron lines and compton humps ; e.g. , gierliski et al 1997 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ; @xcite , @xcite , ibragimov et al 2005 ) . a typical low / hard state spectrum from cyg x-1 , highlighting the very different properties of this state , is shown in red in figure [ suzakuspec ] .",
    "the black one was obtained in the high / soft state on 2010 december 16 .",
    "the red one was taken in the low / hard state on 2005 october 5 , which is the same as used in makishima et al .",
    "( 2008).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the relative geometry of the disk and corona in the low / hard state is still a matter of debate .",
    "one type of models assume that the corona replaces the inner disk , with the flow making a transition to an alternative , hot , geometrically thick , optically thin solution to the accretion flow equations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "exterior to this , the outer truncated disk provides a source of seed photons for the compton scattering from the hot flow , and a site for the reflected emission .",
    "these truncated disk / hot inner flow models are successful in explaining the clear correlations seen in the data ( e.g gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ; @xcite , done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , other geometries have also been proposed , the vertically separated sandwich `` disk - corona configuration '' ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the vertically offset `` lamppost '' model ( e.g. fabian et al 2012 ) , and the vertically outflowing corona ( beloborodov et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a key difference between these models for the low / hard state is the location of the innermost disk radius . in the truncated disk model",
    ", it is assumed to be larger than the innermost stable circular orbit , while in the other geometries the disk is envisaged to extend down to the last stable orbit .",
    "however , a number of spectral analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and timing studies ( miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ; negoro et al . 1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) were unable to unambiguously settle the issue .",
    "this is because the disk emission is much weaker than the comptonized emission in this state , appearing only as a very subtle excess in the lowest energies as shown in figure  1 . to constrain the disk emission requires the best possible constraints on the broad band comptonized emission .",
    "suzaku , the fifth japanese x - ray satellite , carries the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; koyama et al . 2007 )",
    "located at the foci of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) , and a non - imaging hard x - ray instrument , the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; takahashi et al . 2007 ; kokubun et al . 2007 ; yamada et al . 2011 ) .",
    "these two instruments enable us to simultaneously measure a wide - band ( typically 0.5300 kev ) spectrum of bright hard x - ray sources . with this capability ,",
    "suzaku has observed cyg x-1 25 times from 2005 to 2009 in the low / hard state and hard intermediated state , over which the 110 kev flux varied by a factor of @xmath1 3 . the 0.5300 kev spectra taken in the first observation has been reproduced by makishima et al .",
    "2008 ( paper  i ) , invoking two ( hard and soft ) comptonization components , a truncated disk , and reflection components ( the `` double - compton modeling '' itself was first applied to cyg x-1 by frontera et al .",
    "2001 and to agn by magdziarz et al .",
    "based on the `` double - compton modeling '' and other observational facts as to fe - k lines and the refection strength , they proposed that there is an overlapping region between the disk and corona , and changes in the coronal coverage fraction of the disk produce the fast variation .",
    "although this view was confirmed in subsequent suzaku observations ( @xcite , fabian et al 2012 ) , these authors discussed several possible alternatives to the double - compton view , including non - thermal comptonization , jet emission , and complex ionized reflection .",
    "to disentangle such modeling degeneracy , we use the variability on different timescales and try to identify separate spectral components in a model - independent way .",
    "this was already initiated by torii et al .",
    "2011 ( paper  ii ) , who analyzed the hxd ( pin and gso ) data from the 25 observations for spectral and timing properties of the hard x - ray emission . at that time",
    ", they were not able to include the xis data as these are often severely affected by photon pileup . because of this limited energy range",
    ", they could fit their data by a single comptonization component together with a simple reflection model .",
    "now that we have established a method to correct xis data for pile - up effects ( yamada et al .",
    "2012 ) , we can complement the work in paper  ii , by including all the 25 xis data sets .",
    "thus in this paper , we can use the entire broad bandpass of suzaku to study the spectral evolution through the low / hard and hard - intermediate state .",
    "the distance to cyg x-1 has been recently determined as @xmath3 kpc , via a trigonometric parallax measurement using very long baseline array @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with an independent measurement using dust scattering halo ( xiang et al .",
    "2011 ) . based on this distance , the black hole mass and its inclination were derived as @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we adopt these values throughout the present paper .",
    "unless otherwise stated , errors refer to 90% confidence limits .",
    "* the deadtime - corrected exposures and the live - time fractions in percent in the parentheses . * the nxb - subtracted count rates and the nxb fractions in percent in the parentheses . the errors are statistical errors only . * the energy flux of @xmath6@xmath7 kev in an unit of 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 @xmath10 ."
