    "the mechanism by which energy is extracted from large - scale plasma flows and converted into heat is one of the fundamental problems in astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the energy may be dissipated in large current and vorticity sheets , transferred to small scales via a turbulent cascade , converted into heat in a very large number of tiny current sheets , or dissipated in a fashion incorporating several of these mechanisms .",
    "one of the applications of the theory is the problem of particle heating and acceleration in the solar corona that is hundreds of times hotter than the solar photosphere  @xcite .",
    "the most accepted mechanism involves converting coronal magnetic energy into heat .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be frozen into the plasma , so that the twisting and tangling of magnetic field lines by the photospheric footpoint motions eventually releases magnetic energy in the process of magnetic reconnection  @xcite .",
    "in this study we are interested in the case of a slow large - scale motion of the magnetic field lines , i.e. slow compared to the time scale for the alfvn waves to propagate back and forth along the field lines through the system .",
    "this corresponds to the case of slow footpoint motion in coronal heating , where the magnetic loops respond by evolving slowly through a sequence of magnetostatic equilibria  @xcite . as not all of the equilibria have the same magnetic topology",
    ", the deformation of an equilibrium with one topology into another happens through the process of magnetic reconnection , which converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy of the plasma particles  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this process is often studied in the framework of the parker model  @xcite , where the coronal loops are treated as straight plasma columns .",
    "the initially uniform magnetic field lines in a column are attached at both ends to the perfectly conducting boundaries where the slow plasma motion is prescribed .",
    "the problem can not be solved analytically in its most general form and the available numerical simulations can only address reynolds numbers that are hopelessly below the astrophysically relevant values .",
    "consequently , the goal of phenomenological and numerical treatments is to establish the plasma heating rate and , in particular , its scaling with the magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 , in the hope that the results may be extrapolated to the naturally relevant parameter regimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the phenomenological treatment proposed in  @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that in the limit of large @xmath0 the energy dissipation occurs in a finite number of isolated sweet - parker current sheets .",
    "the heating rate was then predicted to scale as @xmath1 .",
    "in more recent studies by  @xcite and @xcite it was proposed that the scaling essentially depends on the rate of magnetic field `` stirring '' by the footpoint motion .",
    "if the typical time of the field - line twisting by random footpoint motion is smaller than the typical time of the magnetic energy build - up and release cycle , then the heating rate becomes independent of the reynolds number .",
    "this conclusion was supported in part by numerical simulations at moderate  @xmath0 .",
    "in this work we propose that in the limit of large reynolds numbers , the fast random magnetic line twisting and tangling does not need to be imposed by footpoint motion .",
    "rather , it is naturally provided by the small - scale turbulence that inevitably develops in such a regime .",
    "once the turbulence is developed , the rate of energy dissipation is dictated by the rate of energy cascade toward small scales , which is independent of the reynolds number .",
    "this picture therefore does not require the random rapid motion of the footpoints .",
    "moreover , it does not require the assumption of a finite number of current sheets in the limit of large  @xmath0 .",
    "such an assumption would in fact be incorrect , as the number of current sheets responsible for energy dissipation in mhd turbulence is known to increase as the reynolds number increases  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to support our phenomenological theory with numerical simulations , we propose a so - called volumetric parker model , where instead of prescribing the displacements of the footpoints , we impose a slow large - scale velocity throughout the entire volume of the fluid .",
    "the justification for this modification is that for high alfvn velocities a boundary displacement is communicated almost instantaneously along the field lines .",
    "a practical advantage of our model is that the volumetric displacement problem can be embedded in a three - dimensional periodic domain and treated numerically with an efficient , highly - accurate spectral method .",
    "this allows us to study the problem with a resolution and statistical ensemble exceeding those of previous studies , and to derive novel scaling laws for the dependence of the magnetic and kinetic fluctuations on the parameters of the large - scale flow .",
    "we solve the full three - dimensional incompressible dissipative mhd equations with an additional volumetric forcing term , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the alfvn velocity based upon the uniform background magnetic field @xmath4 which is in the @xmath5-direction , @xmath6 is the fluctuating plasma velocity normalized by @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the fluctuating magnetic field normalized by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the plasma pressure normalized to @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the background plasma density , @xmath14 is the ( constant ) lundquist number ( the magnetic prandtl number @xmath15 is set to unity , that is , fluid viscosity is equal to magnetic diffusivity ) , where @xmath16 is a characteristic scale length transverse to @xmath4 , and @xmath17 is a forcing term . in these equations time",
    "is normalized by the alfvn time @xmath18 and spatial coordinates are normalized by @xmath16 .",
    "the driving of the system is performed by ensuring that the large - scale velocity field @xmath19 , say , that occupies certain wave numbers ( see below ) , is time independent , while the remaining fourier components of the velocity field are allowed to evolve .",
    "the prescribed part of the velocity field is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21- \\nonumber \\\\ & - \\left({v_0 l_\\perp}/{2}\\right)\\cos\\left({z}/{l_\\parallel}\\right)\\left[\\cos\\left({2 x}/{l_\\perp}\\right)+\\cos\\left({2 y}/{l_\\perp}\\right)\\right].\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , at each time step , the fourier components of @xmath19 are kept fixed while the remaining components of the velocity are allowed to vary .    an equivalent way of looking at this driving mechanism is to assume that all of the components of the velocity field are allowed to evolve , but the large - scale force @xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq : mhd1 ] ) is chosen in such a way that at each time step it brings the large - scale component of the velocity field back to its prescribed value  ( [ eq : stream_f ] ) .",
    "this is the interpretation that we will use in what follows .",
    "it is important to stress that the imposed weak velocity field  @xmath22 is not strong enough to drive turbulence in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "its detailed form is not important , however , it should be chosen so that it will engender non - trivial deformations of the magnetic field . here",
    ", we have chosen a flow with a simple , large - scale cellular structure and non - trivial trajectories .",
    "the dynamics of the system thus essentially depends on the build up and release of magnetic energy , which we discuss in detail in the next sections .",
    "we also note that we do not aim at providing a detailed explanation of coronal heating .",
    "rather , we concentrate on a fundamental mechanism of energy extraction from large scale mhd flows .",
    "we however believe that in the parameter regime @xmath23 , our approach should be qualitatively similar other approaches based on line - tying .",

    "we use a fully dealiased 3d pseudospectral algorithm to perform the spatial discretization on a grid with a resolution of @xmath26 mesh points .",
    "a description of the numerical scheme may be found in @xcite .",
    "in the following sections , we present the results of a series of simulations . the parameters of the simulations are summarized in table  [ tab : sim_params ] .",
    "the values of the lundquist number @xmath27 , which is kept constant in each simulation , are limited from above by the requirement that the resulting turbulent fluctuations are well resolved at the grid scale . by",
    "well resolved we mean that the high wavenumber tail of the spectra has a fast falloff .",
