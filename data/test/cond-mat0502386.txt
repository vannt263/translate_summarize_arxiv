    "the measurement of anomalous hall effect@xcite ( ahe ) in ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors is a powerful tool to characterize the magnetization of thin films and mesoscopic objects .",
    "that is why it attracted recently a lot of attention in the spintronics community.@xcite on the other hand , the theoretical aspects and possible physical mechanisms of ahe are still not quite well understood , and the great efforts are directed now toward the physical explanation of ahe in magnetic semiconductors , pyroclore crystals , and magnetic compounds with inhomogeneous magnetization .",
    "the state of art in the theory of ahe has been recently reviewed by sinova _",
    "et al_.@xcite    relatively well studied interpretations of ahe include the skew scattering @xcite and side - jump @xcite mechanisms , which have been recently revised and physically clarified by crpieux _",
    "et al_.@xcite these mechanisms are related to the scattering from impurities , with the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction playing the leading role , so that the spin - flip interaction is included into the amplitude of scattering from impurities .    it was shown recently that the nonzero spin chirality in some inhomogeneous ferromagnets also leads to the nonvanishing ahe .",
    "@xcite such a _ chirality _ mechanism of ahe is related to the berry phase @xcite acquired by the wave function of electrons moving adiabatically in the inhomogeneous magnetization field . in principle , the so interaction is not a necessary element of this mechanism .",
    "however , in earlier presented theoretical models , the nonvanishing average ahe was obtained only in the presence of so interaction .",
    "otherwise , the spatially averaged off - diagonal conductivity was found to be zero .",
    "a model of magnetic nanostructure without so interaction , leading to the berry phase induced ahe , @xcite has been called the _ topological _ mechanism of ahe .",
    "now the main interest is directed toward another _",
    "`` intrinsic '' _ mechanism of ahe recently proposed by macdonald _",
    "_ @xcite and nagaosa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite this mechanism uses the so interaction included into the hamiltonian of electrons in the crystal lattice .",
    "the key element of this theory is the berry phase in the _ momentum _ space , so that a nontrivial topology of the electron energy bands is necessary for the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "a similar idea of the calculations of hall conductivity has been used long ago in the context of quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite    the berry - phase - induced intrinsic mechanism of ahe does not take into account scattering from impurities .",
    "it was suggested before that the impurities can be totally neglected in case of intrinsic so interaction because the effect of impurities should be necessarily extrinsic .",

    "we present the result of calculations taking into account the effect of impurity scattering .",
    "we demonstrate that there exists another intrinsic contribution to ahe related to the electron states near the fermi surface .",
    "this contribution is not geometric , and we show that it can be of the same order of magnitude as the berry - phase - induced one , which has been calculated before . to calculate properly the non - geometric contribution , we should take into account scattering from impurities leading to the finite relaxation time of electron states at the fermi surface .",
    "accordingly , we take the limit of @xmath1 _ before _",

    "however , we emphasize that the contribution to @xmath9 from the vicinity of the fermi surface ( @xmath10 ) can not be totally neglected .    recently , the role of impurity scattering in ahe has been analyzed within the double - exchange model with non - coplanar spin configuration .",

    "this point was completely neglected in the previous consideration of the intrinsic mechanism of ahe .",
    "fortunately , it does not affect the `` geometric ingredient '' of ahe , @xmath8 , but , as we demonstrated in this paper , it is crucial for the competing contribution @xmath10 .    _ note added : _ after completing the manuscript we were informed that similar results have been also obtained using a different method by sinitsyn , niu , sinova and nomura.@xcite we thank jairo sinova for this information .",
