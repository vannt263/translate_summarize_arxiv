    "symbiotic stars are binary systems in which a compact object accretes from red giant , the wind of which forms a dense nebula around the binary .",
    "the nebula is ionized by the hot compact source , which is usually a white dwarf @xcite . among the known symbiotic stars @xcite ,",
    "four objects have shown recurrent nova ( rn ) eruptions : t crb , rs oph , v3890 sgr and v745 sco .",
    "these eruptions are triggered by a thermonuclear runaway on the white dwarf ( wd ) surface after accretion of a critical amount of h rich material from the companion .",
    "@xcite suggested that during quiescence , the x - ray emission from rn could originate in the boundary layer of an accretion disc that was reconstructed around the wd after the outburst .",
    "therefore , x - ray observations should allow one to determine a lower limit for the accretion rate .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity measured in 350 novae and recurrent novae in quiescence @xcite imply a low accretion rate , inconsistent with the observed recurrence times .",
    "for example , in the case of rs oph @xcite , the short recurrence time of @xmath120 years requires an accretion rate of @xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3/yr , inconsistent with measured x - ray fluxes .",
    "this inconsistency is known as the  missing boundary layer problem \" .",
    "t crb is a well known recurrent nova with recorded outbursts in 1866 and 1946 .",
    "its quiescent - state hard x - ray emission ( e@xmath4 @xmath1 100 kev ) was first revealed during a 9 month @xmath5 survey @xcite .",
    "two additional @xmath5/xrt observations were analyzed by @xcite , who reported highly absorbed emission that was well fit with a cooling flow model with @xmath6=23.1 kev .",
    "the absorber consisted of components that both fully covered and partially covered the hard x - ray source . here",
    "we describe suzaku x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) observations of the recurrent nova t crb performed on september 6 , 2006 .",
    "on september 6th 2006 , the astro - e2/suzaku x - ray observatory performed a 46 ks ( go ) observation of t crb ( obsid 401043010 start time 22:44:21 ut ) .",
    "we reduced the data according to standard procedures using the software package heasoft 6.2 . after determining the xis background count rate from a nearby blank region , we extracted spectra and light curves for the xis and hxd detectors .",
    "we extracted two sets of light curves for each detector  one with a bin size of 360 s ( used to search for stochastic bright variations ) and the other grouping photons every 8 s. we used the light curve with the smaller time bins for power spectrum analysis .",
    "visual inspection of the extracted spectrum showed prominent fe lines around @xmath16.5 kev .",
    "as these lines are an indication of the presence of thermal emission from a plasma with temperatures @xmath110@xmath7 k , we first attempted to fit the spectrum with a single - temperature plasma plus neutral absorption . but no satisfactory fit was obtained . even using more complex absorbers , such as an absorber that only partially covers the source , or absorption from an ionized plasma , did not produce acceptable fits .",
    "we did , however , find acceptable fits ( @xmath8=1.07 ) for a multi - temperature , cooling flow plasma model ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the model required a complex absorber consisting of one absorbing system that fully covered the source [ n@xmath10 @xmath11 , which includes interstellar absorption of 0.047@xmath12@xmath11 ] and and another that only partially covered the source [ n@xmath14 @xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath11 , partial covering fraction of 0.68@xmath17 .",
    "the minimum temperature of the cooling - flow model is consistent with the smallest value allowed by the _",
    "mkcflow _ model ( @xmath18=0.0808 kev ) , and the maximum temperature is @xmath18=57.4@xmath19 kev .",
    "we also added a gaussian emission - line profile to the model to account for the fe k@xmath20 fluorescence line .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectra from the xis and hxd detectors , with the cooling - flow model overplotted . to estimate the parameters for the fe lines",
    ", we used a simple powerlaw fit to establish the continuum level , and then fit the fe k@xmath20 , fe xxv and fe xxvi emission lines with three gaussian profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , right panel ) .",
    "the equivalent widths obtained were 185@xmath21 , 135@xmath22 and 151@xmath23 ev respectively .",
    "we examined the xis time series binned at 360 s ( figure 2 ) and found significant stochastic variability above the level expected from poisson noise .",
    "the fractional amplitude of the stochastic variations , represented as the ratio between the measured rms variation , @xmath24 , and that expected from poisson fluctuations alone , @xmath25 , is 3.75 .",
    "in the case of hxd light curve , no stochastic variations were found above the poisson level .",
    "although by eye there appears to be a periodic ( or quasi - periodic ) variation in the light curve at a period of around 100 minutes , we did not detect a statistically significant oscillation at this period in our preliminary lomb - scargle analysis ( taking into account the underlying broadband continuum power ) of the xis and hxd light curves .",
    "hard x - ray emission with energy up to 100 kev is observed from the dwarf nova ss cyg in quiescence @xcite .",
    "dwarf novae observed with xmm-@xmath26 in quiescence also display spectra with energies up to @xmath112 kev @xcite . for low accretion rates ( @xmath27 3@xmath1510@xmath28 m@xmath3/yr )",
    ", @xcite showed that the most internal part of an accretion disc around a 1 m@xmath3 wd , the boundary layer , radiates as an optically thin plasma at @xmath1 10 kev .",
    "the hardness of the x - ray emission detected from t crb strongly suggest that it comes from the accretion region closest to the wd . from the spectral model fitted ,",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath29 @xmath14.2@xmath1510@xmath28 m@xmath3 yr@xmath30 ( @xmath31/1 kpc)@xmath32 .",
    "the detection of rapid flickering , which typically emanates from regions close to the wd , supports an accretion origin for the detected emission .",
    "moreover , the cooling - flow spectral model , as with boundary layer emission from non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other accreting high - mass white dwarfs @xcite , provides a natural context for the flickering .",
    "the ew of the neutral fe k@xmath20 line suggests that the x - ray source is surrounded by large amounts of neutral material @xcite .",
    "reflection of radiation off of the wd surface can also contribute to the formation of this line . from @xcite ,",
    "the ew of the fe k@xmath20 line when a 2@xmath33 source reflects bremsstrahlung photons with @xmath110 kev is 100 - 200 ev .",
    "therefore the intense fe k@xmath20 line is consistent either with large amounts of neutral material , as with rt cru and cd -57 3057 @xcite , or with reflection from the surface of the wd .",
    "using the suzaku x - ray satellite , we observed hard - x - ray emission from the recurrent nova t crb in quiescence . assuming that a more detailed timing analysis confirms the lack of periodic variations , the presence of flickering on a timescale of minutes and the cooling - flow type spectrum suggest that the accretion onto the wd proceeds through a disc with an optically thin boundary layer .",
