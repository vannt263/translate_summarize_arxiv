    "apart from their extreme biological importance , proteins are also very interesting objects from the point of view of statistical mechanics .",
    "they possess a very well defined native structure which they are able to find in a short time among a potentially huge number of competing ones , and in spite of many metastable states . how proteins reconcile the stability of the native structure with the requirement that this structure is rapidly reached constitutes the essence of the fascinating and still open protein folding problem @xcite",
    "an interesting question is whether the property of folding is a generic property of randomly assembled polypeptidic chains , regardless of their biological function , or is a special property that has evolved through natural selection .",
    "this kind of question makes the protein folding problem a bridge between theoretical biology and the statistical mechanics of disordered systems .",
    "motivated by this , numerous authors have studied simple models of random heteropolymers @xcite , see @xcite for a review .    in the following",
    ", we shall discuss only the ` random bond model ' introduced independently by garel and orland @xcite and by shakhnovich and gutin @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in our numerical simulations we will study a lattice version of this model .",
    "preliminary results of this work have already been presented in @xcite . a `` protein '' with @xmath3 `` amino acids '' is represented as a self - avoiding walk @xcite of @xmath4 steps on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "each pair @xmath5 of non - bonded monomers on nearest neighbor lattice sites contributes to the total energy an amount given by an independent and identically distributed ( iid ) gaussian variable @xmath6 with mean @xmath7 and variance @xmath8 .",
    "formally , one defines the contact map of configuration @xmath9 , @xmath10 , as the matrix of binary variables @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , such that _ ij()= \\ {    ll 1 & + 0 &    .",
    "[ contact ] the energy of the model can then be written as e(,\\{b})=_i < j _ ij()b_ij , with @xmath13 . for a given realization of the interaction energies @xmath6 ( representing a protein sequence in the biological analogy ) , the partition sum @xmath14 at temperature @xmath15",
    "can be formally computed as z_n\\{b_ij } = _ c e^-e(,\\{b})/k_bt , where the sum over configurations @xmath16 runs over all self - avoiding @xmath4-step walks .",
    "obviously , the above expression depends only on the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. we have a two - parameter phase diagram in the variables @xmath0 and @xmath19 .",
    "the main advantage in using @xmath0 as one of the independent variables instead of @xmath15 or @xmath20 is that we can pass continuously from positive ( repulsive , hydrophilic ) to negative ( hydrophobic ) @xmath0 .    as usual with random models",
    ", we have to evaluate the quenched average of the free energy .",
    "this is a very difficult task , while it is rather easy to perform an annealed average over the disorder . for several models of random spin systems",
    "it is well known that such an annealed approximation becomes exact in the high temperature phase , in the thermodynamic limit and at sufficiently large dimension .",
    "the same is thought to be true for the present model .",
    "it was indeed predicted in @xcite that the annealed approximation becomes exact in 3 dimensions when the chain length tends to infinity . for this to be true",
    "it is necessary that the overlap between two randomly chosen replicas with the same realization of disorder vanishes in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "numerical tests of this prediction have been made in the past for chains of length @xmath22 , mostly by means of exact enumerations of maximally compact chains of length 27 @xcite .",
    "these authors found deviations ( replica overlap is non - zero ) which seemed to decrease with @xmath4 .",
    "a similar result even for @xmath23 was found in @xcite , where also monte carlo simulations of very short chains were used ( up to @xmath24 ) .",
    "but it is clear that tests with such short chains can hardly be significant . in the present paper we shall present monte carlo simulations for chains of length up to @xmath25 .",
    "these simulations are made with the perm algorithm developed recently by one of us @xcite , and applied successfully to a number of different polymer problems @xcite .",
    "we study the corrections to the annealed approximation using two different approaches .",
    "first , we compute them using the replica method and assuming replica symmetry , which is believed to hold for low disorder .",
    "even if a full computation was not possible , the expected behavior was well confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "second , we notice that corrections to the annealed approximation in the weak disorder limit can be related exactly to the average overlap between pairs of homopolymers ( without any disorder ) .",
    "we give strong theoretical arguments that this overlap does not vanish in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "we also calculate it by means of monte carlo simulations . unlike in the previous case",
    ", these simulations do not involve the averaging over the disorder and thus can be applied to larger systems .",
    "the two methods agree with each other and show that the corrections to the annealed approximation are small in @xmath26 , but do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "deviations from the annealed approximation are larger in the coil ( high - temperature ) phase and very small in the collapsed ( globular ) phase .",
    "the annealed approximation is presented in sec.2 and compared to results of monte carlo simulations . in order to explain the observed deviations , we study in sec.3 a scenario where the overlap is non - zero but replica symmetry is unbroken . we again compare theoretical predictions with simulation results .",
    "the relationship between the weak disorder limit and homopolymer overlap is discussed in sec.4 .",
    "additional thermodynamic considerations are presented in sec.5 , and our final conclusions are drawn in sec.6 . the perm algorithm used for the simulations is discussed in an appendix .",
    "in thermodynamic systems with quenched disorder we have to consider the average of the free energy per monomer over individual realizations of disorder @xmath27 which formally is given by    f_n(b , ) = -1n -1n _ i < j db_ij e^-(b_ij - b)^2/2 ^ 2 z_n\\{b_ij } .    as for most random systems",

    "[ f - annealed ]    therefore , all thermodynamic variables can be expressed in the annealed approximation in terms of an equivalent homopolymer with shifted interaction strength .",

    "the relations are less simple , since these involve derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath15 which are changed into derivatives with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath19 by our convention of using @xmath31 . for the energy per monomer it holds u_n , ann(b , ) = b-",

    "the ensemble with fixed @xmath37 becomes equivalent to the fixed-@xmath28 ensemble in the limit @xmath21 , thus @xmath28 becomes a non - fluctuating function of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the above formula becomes simply s_n , ann(b,)= f()-^22c n , where @xmath39 is the solution of the saddle point equation f ( ) |_c = c = .",
    "[ fprim ]    the condition for thermodynamic stability is that the second derivative of @xmath40 should be negative , corresponding to @xmath41 being minimal .",

    "in fact , the specific heat for a homopolymer is given by    c_v = bct =- b^2(^2fc^2)^-1 , [ cv ] which has been obtained by deriving both sides of eq.([fprim ] ) with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "homopolymers with attraction between unbonded nearest neighbors show a collapse ( `` theta '' ) transition where the specific heat diverges .",
    "thus we expect that the second derivative @xmath42 vanishes at the theta - point @xmath43 ( the precise value of the transition point depends on the lattice considered ) .",
    "the annealed approximation is supposed to be valid both above and below the theta transition . at very low temperatures and very large disorder",
    ", it has to break down since otherwise the entropy would become negative , according to eq.([s - anneal ] ) .",
    "this signals another phase transition , the so - called freezing transition .",
    "we shall not discuss this regime in this paper , but will treat it in a forthcoming publication .    since the theta point is a tricritical point @xcite ,",
    "its upper critical dimension is d=3 .",
    "therefore , we expect that in three dimensions the `` swelling factor '' is constant , r^2/ n const [ r - theta ] at the theta point , up to logarithmic corrections @xcite . here , @xmath44 is any measure of the size of the polymer , such as the end - to - end distance or the gyration radius .",
    "we expect that this is still true for heteropolymers , as long as we are not yet in the frozen regime . while eq.([r - theta ] ) gives the most precise numerical estimate of the collapse transition ( with @xmath45 @xcite ) , estimates with similar precision can be obtained from the convexity of the free energy @xcite , and the volume dependence of the free energy in case of periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the collapse line in the @xmath46-plot obtained from simulating chains of length @xmath47 is shown in fig.1 . here",
    "the solid line is the annealed approximation .",
    "we see that on this scale the annealed approximation seems perfect .",
    "but this is not quite true .",
    "much more precise tests can be performed by comparing directly both sides of eqs.([f - annealed ] ) to ( [ u - anneal ] ) .",
    "typical plots obtained in this way are shown in figs.[fig : u_ann ] .",
    "for each of these plots we used at least 300 realizations of disorder , and we got at least @xmath48 independent configurations for each disorder realization .",
    "similar plots were made also for several other values of @xmath0 and @xmath19 .    in all these plots we see small but significant deviations .",
    "these deviations are present both in the collapsed ( globular ) and in the open ( coil ) phase .",
    "they depend only weekly on @xmath4 . therefore ,",
    "even with our long chains and high statistics it is not clear whether they disappear for @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , in order to proceed we need more refined theoretical predictions to compare with , and/or a more efficient way to do the disorder average .    before we do this",
    ", we should point out that deviations from the annealed approximation were also found recently in a different model by trovato _",
    "to go beyond the annealed approximation , we will use the replica trick = _ n0 - 1n .",
    "[ rep ] alternatively , we could try a taylor expansion = - 12 ( /^2 -1 ) +  .",
    "[ taylor ] this expansion is most likely divergent .",
    "it is nevertheless useful since its first term gives already a good indication of the leading corrections .",
    "also , it suggests the inequality f_n(b , ) f_n , ann(b , ) which can easily be derived exactly from convexity of the logarithm . the same inequality is expected to hold for @xmath49 .",
    "this inequality is equivalent to the existence of a negative correlation between the average energy and the partition function . to use eq.([rep ] ) , we first have to evaluate disorder averages of @xmath50 for integer @xmath51 .",
    "these are performed similarly to the average over @xmath14 , except that the gaussian integrals give formally rise to interactions between replicas @xcite , = _ c_1_n ( -_=1^n(_i < j_ij^)+ ^22_(_i < j_ij^_ij^ ) ) .",

    "the annealed approximation is equivalent to neglecting the two - replicas term .",
    "to proceed , we define the variables c_=1n_i < j_ij^ , q_=1n_i < j_ij^_ij^ , [ cq ] which are respectively the density of contacts for the contact map @xmath52 and the overlap between two contact maps @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the overlap is a measure of similarity , and it is equal to one if and only if the two contact maps coincide .",

    "in other words , @xmath60 is the entropy loss per monomer when we impose that the replica @xmath61 with density of contacts @xmath62 has overlaps @xmath63 with the @xmath64 previous replicas .",

[ eq_q ]    for @xmath74 ( homopolymer ) eq.([eq_q ] ) just means that the value of the overlap is the most probable one for a given @xmath28 , @xmath75 .",

    "thus , if such a loop is present in one replica , it has a high chance to be present also in the other replica , even if the global structures of both replicas are entirely different .",
    "notice that this argument depends crucially on the fact that it is the overlap between _ contact matrices _ which is of relevance , not the geometric overlap between configurations .",
    "it seems that the authors of @xcite have missed this in an otherwise very similar argument which has led them to the opposite conclusion that the annealed approximation does become exact .    in collapsed chains",
    "there are relatively more long range contacts , which explains why the annealed approximation is better  but still not exact  in that regime . for random heteropolymers with strong disorder , and",
    "even more so for proteins , this argument suggests an increased overlap because of secondary structure .",
    "for instance , an alpha helix produces an array of contacts @xmath107 , @xmath108 , where @xmath105 labels the position of the amino acid along the protein chain .",
    "this enhances the overlap .",
    "moreover , there is a finite probability that such contacts appear simultaneously even in the structures of two unrelated proteins .",
    "thus the average overlap even in a large set of unrelated protein structure appears to attain a finite limit when the length of the chains increases @xcite .",
    "the two saddle point equations for @xmath28 and @xmath73 can not be explicitly solved , because we lack an explicit expression for the functions @xmath36 and @xmath78 .",

    "+ (q ) _ 0 & & (q ) _",
    "[c ^2 fc^2+a_2(c)q_0cq_0c ] [ chi(cq ) ] @xmath81 must be computed at the first order in @xmath124 , because the zero - th order term vanishes at the theta point @xmath43 at which @xmath125 vanishes .",
    "the result reads :    h(c , q)- (q - q_0(c))c(a_2(c))^2 ^ 2 q_0c^2 .",
    "[ hh ]    to proceed further , we first consider the simple case where the entropy @xmath78 depends only on the product @xmath117 representing the number of conditions that we have to impose in order to fix an overlap @xmath73 : @xmath126 .",
    "this form was assumed in the work of shakhnovich and gutin @xcite .",
    "as it is easy to see , under the above hypothesis @xmath127 coincides with the value predicted by the annealed approximation and it is independent of @xmath19 at fixed @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in this case the annealed approximation would yield the correct value for the fraction of contacts .",
    "however , our numerical results contradict this prediction .",
    "the overlap @xmath73 is in this case an increasing function of @xmath19 , and its derivative with respect to @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath128 , which is expected to diverge at the theta point @xmath43 .",
    "this fact can explain why the values of @xmath73 are much smaller in the collapsed phase than in the coil phase .",
    "a better theory for the function @xmath78 was developed by plotkin , wang and wolynes @xcite .",
    "they computed the entropy loss for two replicas with density of contacts @xmath28 being at overlap @xmath73 , @xmath129 , in the mean field approximation and in the collapsed phase .",
    "although this can be different from @xmath78 , it is a good point for understanding its qualitative behavior .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use the formula obtained in @xcite because of several reasons : first , the result is valid for finite @xmath4 and becomes pathologic as @xmath21 ; second , it is not given in the form of a differentiable function ; and third , it is assumed that the most probable overlap @xmath75 is zero in the thermodynamic limit , while our calculations show that this is not the case .",
    "we shall however use the fact that @xmath78 is the sum of three contributions : the entropy loss due to imposing that @xmath130 contacts have to coincide , the loss due the fact that @xmath131 contacts have to be different , and a combinatoric factor counting the number of different choices of @xmath130 contacts among @xmath132 .",
    "the last term can be approximated by @xmath133 $ ] , even if this is an overestimate , since not all of the combinations of different common contacts can be realized .",
    "putting everything together we have :    ( c , q)=(c , cq)+c[qq+(1-q)(1-q ) ] [ plot ] . in the computation by plotkin _",
    "_ the mixed second derivative of @xmath134 with respect to @xmath117 and @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "this simplifies considerably formulas , and it will be assumed to hold for the rest of the paper .",
    "we shall thus introduce the notation @xmath135 to denote the derivative of @xmath136 with respect to @xmath117 at fixed @xmath28 . comparing eq.([plot ] ) to eq.([chi_approx ] ) , we see that @xmath137 must be positive and that @xmath138 .",
    "we also see that @xmath139 is likely to be a quantity of order @xmath140 , as it has been assumed above . for the higher order",
    "coefficients one finds @xmath141 , as anticipated .",
    "we have now to compute the derivatives of @xmath118 :    = -^2/cq^2/q^2= q_01+cq_0^(cq_0)(1-q_0 ) 0 , [ q ] in qualitative agreement with fig.[fig : cq ] . inserting the above result in the formulas ( [ chi(cq ) ] )",
    "we see that the density of contacts decreases with @xmath19 at fixed @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by our numerical results ( see fig.[fig : c_delta ] ) , which also show that the decrease is maximal for @xmath142 , as expected from the fact that @xmath143 vanishes at @xmath43 .",
    "the overlap @xmath73 increases with @xmath37 at fixed @xmath19,as expected from eq.([chi(cq ) ] ) ( see fig.[fig : delta ] ) , and increases with @xmath19 at fixed @xmath37 , as expected from eq.([q ] ) ( see fig.[fig : delta ] again ) .",
    "it can thus be understood why the overlap decreases with system size : as the number @xmath4 of monomers increases the importance of surface effects is reduced ( as @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 increases , thus decreasing the value of @xmath73 .",
    "we now examine the condition of thermodynamic stability , @xmath146 . as it was already observed , since at the point @xmath147 both the gradient of @xmath78 and its hessian determinant vanish , we have @xmath148 . at the theta point",
    "this quantity vanishes , and @xmath149 is given by the deviations from the annealed approximation .",
    "three situations are possible : first , @xmath149 can be positive at the leading order in @xmath150 . in this case",
    "the thermodynamic stability would be violated around the theta point , but our simulations do not show anything strange in this region .",
    "second , the leading order in @xmath124 can be negative . in this case ,",
    "the specific heat would not diverge anymore at the theta point for finite @xmath19 , but it would show a peak proportional to some negative power of @xmath124 . thus the disorder would smear out the thermodynamic singularity at @xmath43 , leaving unchanged the geometric characterization of the collapsed chains in terms of the gyration radius .",
    "it is rather difficult , if not impossible , to test this scenario by means of simulations .",
    "third , @xmath149 can vanish identically at @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that this condition , combined with the assumption that @xmath78 is of the form ( [ plot ] ) , is fulfilled if and only if @xmath151 is of the form    ^(cq)=(1-cq / bcq / a ) , [ chi_pr ] where @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are two constants , and @xmath28 is not too small so that the last inequality can be fulfilled . in this case",
    ", one finds @xmath155 $ ] , and it is easy to check that all previous results are recovered , while @xmath156 vanishes for all @xmath73 and @xmath28 , including the theta point .    summarizing the discussion , we find that , if @xmath78 is of the form ( [ plot ] ) , two possibilities are open : either @xmath151 is given by eq.([chi_pr ] ) , in which case @xmath157 , or @xmath151 has a different form , in which case the specific heat is not anymore divergent at the theta point @xmath43 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to decide among these alternatives .",
    "we conclude this section showing in fig.[fig : chi27 ] , for the sake of completeness , the entropy loss @xmath129 obtained from simulations of homopolymer chains with @xmath158 . although the system size considered is definitely too small for quantitative considerations , the qualitative behavior is interesting and confirms the above considerations .",
    "the entropy @xmath129 was computed from    _ 2(c , q)=-1np_2(c , q ) , where @xmath159 is the probability density for a pair of chains , both with density of contacts @xmath28 , being at overlap @xmath73 .",
    "we have shown that the annealed approximation is very good but not exact for a particular model of random heteropolymers , and we have given simple physical arguments for it .",
    "we have also computed the thermodynamics of the model using the replica symmetric approximation , and we have shown that such approach can explain very well , at least qualitatively , the observed deviations from the annealed approximation in the high temperature phase .",
    "the replica symmetric calculation also leaves open , surprisingly , the possibility that the disorder could cancel the thermodynamic singularity at the theta point .",
    "a numerical test of this possibility is very difficult , and it has been left out .    in our present study",
    "we have not addressed the most interesting aspect of the model  the freezing of the system in a finite number of mesoscopic states .",
    "this transition should represent some features of the folding transition taking place for protein structures .",
    "instead , we have studied the model at higher temperatures and at smaller disorder .",
    "this should however be of interest also in the context of the freezing , since it was conjectured @xcite that freezing can be described in this model by the random energy model , a prerequisite for which is that the annealed approximation is exact .    in the present simulations we have studied chains of length up to @xmath25 .",
    "deviations from the annealed approximation decrease fast for small @xmath4 , which explains why studying very short chains has mislead several authors to the conclusion that these deviations vanish for @xmath21 .",
    "but in the high - t ( open coil ) phase this decrease clearly stops , and deviations are roughly independent of @xmath4 for @xmath160 .",
    "this is less clear in the collapsed phase .",
    "but also there numerics , general arguments , and detailed calculations within a specific scenario with unbroken replica symmetry all indicate that these deviations will settle at a non - zero value for large @xmath4 .",
    "this casts doubts on the validity of the random energy picture for protein folding .",
    "there are of course a number of questions which are left open by the present study .",
    "first of all , we have deliberately left out all questions related to freezing .",
    "secondly , our treatment of sec.3 assumed that the overlap distribution is always dominated by a single peak .",
    "this is most likely not true in the frozen regime , and the distribution of overlaps is certainly a most interesting object .",
    "we shall address these questions in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "finally , we have studied only one particular model , where contact energies are independent gaussian variables .",
    "several other models of random heteropolymers are studied in the recent literature @xcite , and several of them present very intersting open problems .",
    "we are indebted to many colleges for useful discussions , in particular to h. frauenkron , w. nadler , h. orland , e. shakhnovich , a. trovato and m. vendruscolo .",
    "this method which was first described in detail in @xcite is a chain growth method .",
    "it is based on rosenbluth s idea of biased sampling @xcite , but it deviates from it by deleting ( ` pruning ' ) configurations with too low weight , and copying configurations with too large weight ( ` enrichment ' ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the bias in the rosenbluth method requires each configuration to carry a non - trivial weight which builds up gradually as monomer by monomer is added .",
    "in addition to this ` rosenbluth factor ' , there is also a boltzmann factor in the case of interacting polymers . the weights which control pruning / enrichment are the product of the two .",
    "both pruning and enrichment are done while the chains grow , i.e. based on the actual ( incomplete ) weight factors . in some cases it is advantageous to use not the present weights but ( implicit ) estimates of future weights to control the algorithm @xcite , but this is not done in the present paper .",
    "instead , we use some of the special tricks used for strongly collapsed systems in @xcite .",
    "when the weight is too low , configurations are not simply killed ( this would imply systematic errors ) , but instead they are killed with probability 1/2 , and those which are not killed get their weights doubled .",
    "similarly , in the case of cloning the weight is spread uniformly among all clones .",
    "technically , cloning is performed by means of recursive subroutine calls .",
    "a pseudocode of the basic algorithm is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the most important shortcoming of the rosenbluth method is that the distribution of weights can become extremely wide for large systems and at low temperatures .",
    "the only exception is for interacting homopolymers on the simple cubic lattice at the theta point , where rosenbluth and boltzmann factors nearly cancel . in less favorable cases",
    "even a very large statistical sample can be dominated by just a handful of high weight events , and statistical errors grow out of bounds .",
    "even worse , in extreme cases the events which would carry ( in average ! )",
    "most of the weight are so rare that they are missed completely with high probability , and the free energy is underestimated systematically .    pruning and",
    "enrichment guarantee that the weights of individual configurations stay within narrow bounds , and the above can not happen .",
    "but in very difficult situations ( large @xmath4 , low t , large disorder ) it may happen that due to cloning the configurations are strongly correlated , and the weights of clusters of such correlated configurations play essentially a similar role as the weights of individual configurations in the above discussion . in the following",
    "we will call such a cluster which is composed of all configurations having a common root a ` tour ' . in order to check that the weights of tours do not become too uneven ,",
    "we have measured in their distribution .",
    "let us call the weights @xmath161 , and the distribution @xmath162 .",
    "we are on safe grounds if this distribution is so narrow that @xmath162 and @xmath163 have basically the same support .",
    "in particular , we should require that the maximum of @xmath163 occurs at such values where @xmath162 is still appreciable , and the distribution is well sampled .",
    "we have verified that this is the case for all data shown in the present paper .",
    "notice , however , that this is a very stringent requirement .",
    "if it is were not satisfied , this would not necessarily mean that the data are wrong , since configurations within one tour are only partially correlated .",
    "the generalization of this algorithm to pairs of chains growing simultaneously is straightforward @xcite .",
    "one just has to add monomers alternatingly .",
    "when the total number of monomers in both chains is even , the addition of the next monomer is attempted at chain 1 ; when this number is odd , the next monomer is added to chain 2 ."
