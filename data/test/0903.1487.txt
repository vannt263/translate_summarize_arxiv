    "@xcite among the perovskite oxides , the series @xmath4nio@xmath0 ( @xmath4 : rare earth ) is well known to show interesting behavior such as mits , spin- and charge - ordering .",
    "lanio@xmath0 with a trivalent ni@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the reference material of the series , crystallizing in a 3-d nearly cubic structure with a small rhombohedral distortion ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it exhibits enhanced pauli paramagnetic metal behavior down to low temperature ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "lanio@xmath0 undergoes an oxygen vacancy controlled correlated metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition , while the other members ( e.g. , @xmath4 = pr , nd , sm ) show mit as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite the @xmath8 dependent mit coupled antiferromagnetic transition results in a ( @xmath9/2 0 @xmath10/2 ) reflection due to charge - order ( more precisely , charge disproportionation of the type ni@xmath11-ni@xmath12 ) , and not due to orbital ordering , as was recently characterized by resonant soft and hard x - ray scattering .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the magnetic susceptibility of the entire series in the metallic phase is that of an enhanced pauli metal due to the nio@xmath13 matrix , and far from a stoner type ferromagnetic instability .",
    "@xcite the specific heat and susceptibility data , as well as @xmath14 dependence of resistivity of lanio@xmath0 indicate that this compound is well described as a strongly correlated system close to a mit .",
    "@xcite an enhanced effective mass ( @xmath15 @xmath16 10@xmath17 ) is well established from thermopower and specific heat measurements .",
    "@xcite thus , lanio@xmath0 is a genuine 3-d fermi liquid with correlated 3@xmath18 electrons in a quarter filled @xmath19 band .",
    "bulk single crystal growth of lanio@xmath0 has not been possible to date .",
    "however single crystalline epitaxial thin films have been successfully synthesized for device applications and provide a very suitable metallic template for electrical contacts to perovskite films .",
    "@xcite in a recent study , we succeeded in fabricating single crystalline epitaxial thin films and studying it by angle - integrated photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) . @xcite we reported the observation of a clear sharp @xmath19 derived peak at the fermi level ( @xmath20 ) , which could not be detected in earlier studies .",
    "@xcite this peak gets gapped across the oxygen vacancy controlled mit in lanio@xmath21 .",
    "a narrow band at @xmath20 is typical of correlated metals , but momentum or angle - resolved pes is necessary to directly probe 3-d fss and renormalization of band dispersions .",
    "such studies require an accurate determination of the in - plane and out of plane components of the momentum vector of an electron , and is an intrinsically difficult experiment for 3-d systems requiring tunable photons from a synchrotron source .",
    "recent studies have reported soft x - ray angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of elemental metals @xcite and correlated - electron systems .",
    "@xcite the role of non - direct transitions could be identified at high temperature in elemental metals . for _",
    "f_-electron systems , dispersive bands and even fs crossings have been identified .",
    "however , the momentum dependence of renormalized band dispersions due to electron - electron correlations has not been addressed . here",
    ", we report the momentum - resolved pes of lanio@xmath0 using soft x - rays .",
    "the aim of the present work is to determine the fss and the role of correlations in a 3-d fermi liquid .",
    "recent theory showed that kinks can appear in the band dispersion of 3-d materials as a consequence of correlations , based on dynamical mean field theory in combination with the local density approximation ( lda+dmft ) calculations . @xcite",
    "these calculations carried out for the case of an energy dependent , but momentum independent self - energy , suggested consistency with low energy arpes of srvo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite kinks are often found in systems with strong electron - phonon coupling within 100 mev below @xmath20 , for example , as in high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "@xcite moreover kinks on a higher energy scale , about 300 - 500 mev , were also reported in high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "@xcite these anomalies suggest that kinks can occur due to a variety of reasons such as electron - phonon interaction , short - range coulomb interaction , etc . since lanio@xmath0 is a strongly correlated metal , one may expect to see anomalies in its momentum - resolved electronic structure .",
    "the lanio@xmath0 thin films were grown on srtio@xmath0 single - crystal substrates .",
    "a sintered stoichiometric lanio@xmath0 pellet was used as an ablation target .",
    "a nb - doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser was used in its frequency - tripled mode ( @xmath22 = 355 nm ) at a repetition rate of 1 hz . the srtio@xmath0 substrates were annealed at 900 @xmath23c at an oxygen pressure of 1 @xmath24 10@xmath25 pa before deposition . the substrate temperature was set to 650 @xmath23c and the oxygen pressure was 10 pa during the deposition .",
    "the lanio@xmath0 films were subsequently annealed at 400 @xmath23c for 30 minutes at atmospheric pressure of oxygen to remove vacancies . after cooling the sample to below 100 @xmath23c and evacuating the growth chamber ,",
    "the surface morphology and crystallinity of the fabricated lanio@xmath0 films were checked by an in situ observation of reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) patterns .",
    "further details on the characterization are described in ref .  .",

    "the energy resolution was set to @xmath16150 and 200 mev and the angular resolution was @xmath27 0.2 degree , which corresponds to a momentum resolution of @xmath27 0.043 @xmath28 at @xmath29 = 630 ev    the high symmetry momentum points ( @xmath30 and x ) and the fermi crossings were accurately determined from energy dependent normal emission spectra and a free electron final state , taking into account the photon momentum into consideration .",

    "while bulk lanio@xmath0 as well as thin film lanio@xmath0 show a small rhombohedral distortion and are not simple cubic , the band structure of rhombohedral lanio@xmath0 is well explained by zone folding of a cubic brillouin zone into a rhombohedral brillouin zone .",
