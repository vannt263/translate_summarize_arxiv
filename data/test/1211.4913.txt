    "sap flow in deciduous trees is driven during the growing season by the process of transpiration , in which evaporation of water in the leaves draws groundwater from the roots to the crown  @xcite . as much as 90%  of water taken up by the tree is transpired into the atmosphere to generate the large pressure differential needed to overcome gravity ; only 10%of the water is actually consumed in photosynthesis reactions in the leaves to produce the sugars needed for growth and other life processes .",
    "these sugars are transported by the sap in dissolved form back to the trunk and roots where they are either consumed immediately or else stored as starch for later use .",
    "transpiration halts in late fall when the leaves drop and the tree enters its winter dormant phase , which lasts until the spring thaw . at that time ,",
    "the stored starch reserves are released and provide the energy needed to initiate budding and leaf growth before photosynthesis and transpiration can begin again .    in the sugar maple ( _ acer saccharum _ ) , a process known as _ sap",
    "exudation _ occurs in the time period between the dormant leafless phase and the active transpiration phase , when certain processes are triggered that build up positive sap pressure and convert stored starches into sugars .",
    "the stem pressure is large enough that when the tree is tapped , sap exudes naturally from the tap - hole .",
    "the mechanism that generates this internal pressure is unique to the sugar maple and a few other related species ( black and red maple , birch , walnut , and butternut ) whose sap sugar content is also significant although not typically as high as sugar maple .",
    "raw maple sap typically contains 2 to 3%  sugar by weight ( primarily sucrose ) and can be processed by repeated boiling to produce sweet syrup and other edible maple products .",
    "the scientific study of sap exudation has a long history that has seen several competing hypotheses proposed for the mechanism that drives sap flow in spring .",
    "these hypotheses can be roughly divided into two classes : `` vitalistic '' models that require some intervention by living cells ; and `` physical '' models that rely on passive , physical effects .",
    "early in the 20th century , wiegand s experiments  @xcite showed that even though up to one - quarter of the total volume of sapwood or _",
    "xylem _ is filled with gas , the expansion and contraction of this gas in response to temperature changes alone could still not account for the observed pressure changes .",
    "he concluded that some active process initiated by living cells must be responsible , a claim that was supported by the experiments of johnson  @xcite .",
    "later studies questioned this vitalistic hypothesis , for example stevens and eggert  @xcite who attributed the pressure generation in leafless maple trees to volume changes arising from freezing and thawing of sap .",
    "this hypothesis was further explored in subsequent years  @xcite , culminating in the ground - breaking paper of milburn and omalley  @xcite who proposed that gas trapped in the xylem is compressed by growth of ice crystals and subsequent uptake of water when the tree freezes in fall ; during the spring thaw , they argued that this compressed gas generates the pressures that drive exudation . this freeze / thaw hypothesis was later supported by experimental evidence  @xcite showing that gas expansion due to thawing sap is the primary cause of exudation pressure ; they also found no evidence to suggest that living cells play a significant role .",
    "however , the milburn  omalley model was unable to account for all observations , and so some authors  @xcite cast doubt on the ability of gas expansion alone to explain exudation , arguing that heightened pressures in the xylem will dissolve any gas bubbles within a few hours .",
    "several studies  @xcite suggested that osmotic pressure , generated by differences in sugar concentration across semi - permeable structures that separate various cells in the xylem , could play a significant supporting role in sap exudation .",
    "most notably , tyree proposed  @xcite that a combination of the freeze / thaw mechanism and osmosis is the key to maintaining stable gas bubbles in the xylem over observed exudation time scales .",
    "this issue remains controversial and the current situation is perhaps best summed up by amglio et  al .  who concluded that `` no existing single model explains all of the xylem winter pressure data , '' so that both vitalistic and physical effects must play a role  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a clear consensus in the tree physiology literature regarding the precise mechanisms driving sap exudation is compounded by the fact that no detailed mathematical model has yet been developed for the freeze / thaw mechanism , not to mention the other effects of osmosis and gas dissolution .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to develop a mathematical model that captures the essential processes driving sap exudation .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : tree - physiology ] by providing details of tree physiology , sap flow , and the milburn ",
    "omalley and tyree hypotheses for pressure generation , at the core of which is the special role played by two types of non - living xylem cells called vessels and fibers . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we derive a system of differential equations governing the multiphase gas / liquid / ice system that incorporates the effects of thawing sap in the fibers , dissolving gas bubbles in the vessels , and the osmotic pressure pressure gradient between the two . numerical simulations in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] are used to validate the model and conclusions are drawn regarding the various mechanism for sap generation in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first provide some background information on tree structure and the hydraulics of sap flow that can be found in texts such as @xcite .",
    "we also describe the freeze / thaw model proposed by milburn and omalley , and indicate how other mechanisms such as gas dissolution and osmotic pressure enter the picture .",
    "the milburn ",
    "omalley model is a purely physical one that operates at the cellular level and depends fundamentally on the structure of the non - living cells making up the xylem .",
    "as pictured in figure  [ fig : fibers - vessels](a ) , the xylem consists of long , hollow , roughly cylindrical cells of two types : _ fibers _ , that are the main structural members in the wood ; and _ vessels _ , that have a larger radius and form the primary conduit for transmitting sap .",
    "an individual vessel can extend for up to tens of centimeters vertically through the xylem , and is subdivided into _",
    "elements _ that are connected end - to - end via perforated plates to form a continuous hydraulic connection .",
    "vessels are connected to each other via numerous _",
    "pits _ or cavities that perforate the vessel walls .",
    "the fibers are in turn subdivided into two sub - classes : _ libriform fibers _ and _ tracheids_. according to cirelli et al .",
    "@xcite , the tracheid walls also contain pits through which they exchange sap with the vessels and hence integrating the tracheids into the water transport system of the tree .",
    "we will therefore ignore the tracheids , treating them as a part of the vessel network , and focus instead on the fibers .",
    "in comparison with tracheids , the libriform fibers ( or simply `` fibers '' ) lack the pits that provide a direct hydraulic connection to the vessels and so they are often considered to play a primarily structural role",
    ". however , the recent experiments of cirelli et  al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the fiber secondary wall has a measurable permeability to water .",
    "other experiments show that under normal conditions , maple trees ( and other species that exude sap in spring ) are characterized by gas - filled fibers and water - filled vessels  @xcite .",
    "this is in direct contrast with most other tree species whose fibers are completely filled with water .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of gas in xylem fibers may be connected with the ability of maple trees to generate exudation pressure in the leafless state .",
    "the mechanism proposed by milburn and omalley  @xcite , and discussed in complete detail in  @xcite , can be summarized as follows :    * during late fall or early winter when the tree freezes , ice crystals form on the inner wall of the fibers and the growing ice layer compresses the gas trapped inside . * in early spring when temperatures rise above freezing , ice crystals in the fiber melt and the pressure of the trapped gas drives the melted sap through the fiber walls into the vessel , hence leading to the elevated pressures observed during sap exudation .",
    "tyree  @xcite estimates that this effect is responsible for a pressure increase of roughly 3060  .",
    "* exudation pressure is enhanced by the gravitational potential of sap that was drawn into the crown during the previous fall , and once thawed is then free to fall toward the roots .    as mentioned before",
    ", this model can account for the initiation of exudation pressure but it can not explain how pressures are sustained over periods longer than about 12 hours because gas bubbles will dissolve when pressurized .",
    "tyree  @xcite explains how surface tension effects require that any gas bubble is at higher pressure than the surrounding fluid . as a result",
    ", henry s law necessitates that the concentration of dissolved gas in the region adjacent to the bubble is proportional to interfacial pressure . since the gas concentration is highest there , dissolved gas diffuses away from the bubble and eventually causes the bubble to disappear .    one clue to identifying a mechanism that can sustain gas bubbles over longer time periods",
    "is provided by experiments that show maple trees exude sap only when sugar is present  @xcite . with this in mind , tyree  @xcite proposed a modification of the milburn ",
    "omalley mechanism in which osmotic pressures arising from differences in sucrose concentration could permit gas bubbles to remain stable . in particular , he suggested that the fiber secondary walls are selectively permeable , permitting water to pass through but not larger molecules like sucrose .",
    "therefore , the ice layer that forms on the inner surface of the fibers in fall / winter is composed of pure water , which leads to an osmotic potential difference between the fibers and the vessels .    _",

    "the geometry is depicted in figure  [ fig : fibves ] which is an idealized view of figure  [ fig : fibers - vessels](b ) . before deriving the governing equations ,",
    "we make the following simplifying assumptions :    1 .   we [ assume : thaw ] consider only the thawing phase , assuming that all water within the fibers is initially frozen .",
    "gravitational potential differences due to height [ assume : gravity ] can be neglected since we focus only locally on a small section of the xylem .",
    "we [ assume : element ] consider a single vessel element and ignore interactions between adjacent elements .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if all elements experience similar conditions , and any gas contained within an element is isolated by the perforated plates from that of its neighbors .",
    "the [ assume : nfiber ] vessel is surrounded by @xmath0 identical fibers . although our model considers only a single fiber explicitly , the fluxes and other fiber quantities are scaled by a factor @xmath0 to determine the total influence of all @xmath0 fibers on the vessel .",
    "the [ assume : cylinder ] fiber and vessel are hollow and cylindrical in shape , with interior radii @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and heights @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "both have large aspect ratio so that @xmath5 . 6 .",
    "we assume the problem is one - dimensional , with the domain extending horizontally from the center of the fiber to the rightmost outer edge of the vessel ( pictured at the top of figure  [ fig : fibves ] ) .",
    "the [ assume : coord ] coordinate system is chosen so that the horizontal ( @xmath6 ) axis is directed along the line joining the centers of the fiber and vessel and with origin @xmath7 at the center of the fiber .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig : fibves ] , the fiber / vessel interface is located at @xmath8 and the center of the vessel at @xmath9 .",
    "gas is present in both [ assume : vesselgas ] fiber and vessel .",
    "although the existence of gas in the fiber is a fundamental assumption of the milburn ",
    "omalley model , the gas in the vessel is a novel feature introduced in our model . because water is incompressible and the xylem is a closed system when the tree is frozen , pressure can not be transferred between the fiber and vessel compartments unless gas is also present in the vessel .",
    "further justification for this assumption is provided in the papers @xcite , which indicate that maple trees experience winter embolism ( bubble formation ) when gas in the vessels is forced out of solution upon freezing .",
    "gas [ assume : bubble ] in both fiber and vessel takes the form of a cylindrical bubble located at the center of the corresponding cell .",
    "this seems reasonable in the vessel where the surface tension is of the order of @xmath10 , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the typical gas and liquid pressures . in the fiber ,",
    "the smaller radius gives rise to a much larger surface tension ( @xmath11 ) which though still small relative to gas and liquid pressures could still potentially initiate a break - up into smaller bubbles owing to the plateau - rayleigh instability  @xcite . however , regardless of the precise configuration of the gas in the fiber , we assume that the net effect on gas pressure is equivalent to that of a single large bubble .",
    "heat [ assume : ice ] from outside the tree enters from the right in figure  [ fig : fibves ] .",
    "consequently , the sap in the vessel is taken to be initially in liquid form and the ice in the fiber begins melting on the inner surface of the fiber wall . 10 .",
    "gas and ice temperatures in the fiber can be taken as constant and equal to the freezing point .",
    "this is justified by the fiber length scale [ assume : tfiber ] being so much smaller than that of the vessel ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "time [ assume : tvessel ] scales for heat and gas diffusion are much shorter than those corresponding to ice melting and subsequent phase interface motion ( which our simulations show are on the order of minutes to hours ) .",
    "this is justified by considering the various diffusion coefficients ( @xmath13 ) and a typical length scale ( @xmath14 ) , and in each case calculating the corresponding diffusion time scale @xmath15 : * _ diffusion in gas bubbles : _ using the air self - diffusion coefficient @xmath16 , the time scale is @xmath17 ; * _ diffusion of dissolved gas : _",
    "diffusivity @xmath18 of air in water gives @xmath19 ; * _ diffusion of heat : _ thermal diffusivities @xmath20 ( for air ) and @xmath21 ( for water ) yield @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "+ therefore , heat transport is essentially quasi - steady and the temperature equilibrates rapidly to any change in local conditions .",
    "also , gas concentration and density ( in both gaseous and dissolved forms ) can be taken as constants in space .",
    "a significant osmotic [ assume : osmosis ] pressure arises owing to differences in sugar content between liquid in the vessel and fiber .",
    "this is motivated by recent experiments which show that the fiber cell wall is permeable to water but not to larger molecules such as sucrose  @xcite , suggesting that ice contained in the fiber is composed of pure water .",

    "the aim of this work was to develop a detailed mathematical model that captures the physical effects  heat and mass transport , gas dissolution , surface tension , osmosis and phase change  that are believed to play a significant role in sap exudation in maple trees .",
    "in particular , we were interested in investigating two competing hypotheses for sap exudation based on a model of milburn  omalley ( without osmosis )  @xcite and another of tyree ( with osmosis )  @xcite .",
    "the model focuses on the cellular scale and the transfer of pressure between two main xylem components : fibers and vessels .",
    "we derived a coupled system of nonlinear , time - dependent , differential - algebraic equations , which we solved using matlab .",
    "extensive numerical simulations were performed that uncovered the following :    * it is necessary to include the effect of gas bubbles in the vessel sap in order to allow a transfer of stored pressure in the fibers to the vessel sap .",
    "this gas in the vessels was not explicitly mentioned by either milburn ",
    "omalley or tyree .",
    "* taking parameter values consistent with data in the literature , our model captures positive vessel pressures provided that the gas in the fiber is sufficiently compressed during the previous year s freezing phase .",
    "the observed increase in vessel sap pressure lies in the range of 3060 that is consistent with experimental values reported in the literature for maple sap exudation . * for a wide range of parameters , and provided the vessel gas content is low enough , the fibers are able to completely dissolve the gas bubbles within the vessel sap .",
    "this is consistent with the phenomenon of embolism repair that is known to occur in maple as well as other hardwood species .",
    "* reasonable exudation pressures are obtained both with and without osmosis .",
    "one impact of including osmotic effects is to increase slightly the threshold vessel bubble size below which gas in the vessel gas dissolves entirely ; in this respect , our model suggests that osmosis may enhance embolism repair .",
    "the second main impact of osmosis is to lessen the likelihood that the fiber gas bubble collapses , which enhances the ability to exude sap .",
    "this paper can only be considered as a preliminary study of sap exudation because the comparisons and conclusions we have drawn so far are mainly qualitative .",
    "more detailed comparisons with experimental data in the literature are currently underway to further validate the model , and will form the basis of a future publication .",
    "there are a number of other specific areas that we believe would provide fruitful avenues for future research :    * the long - time behavior pictured in figures  [ fig : case5a ] and  [ fig : case5d ] suggests that this problem is ripe for a multi - layer asymptotic analysis in which the solution is divided into two pieces : a linear solution , matched to initial conditions via a boundary layer on the left ; and a constant equilibrium state that is matched across an interior layer to the linear solution .",
    "* the predictive power of this model would be strengthened with better estimates of two parameters : the gas content in the vessel , and the initial pressure in the fiber .",
    "we will perform a more extensive search of the literature and focus in particular on data from studies of embolism . in conjunction with this effort",
    ", we believe that our model ( with only minor modifications ) could also be applied to study the phenomenon of embolism repair coinciding with the spring thaw  @xcite . *",
    "the conditions under which the maple tree freezes at the end of the previous season are known to have a significant impact on sap exudation during the following spring . to study this process",
