    "tls have been reported so far from both accreting black holes ( bhs , cyg x-1 , gx339 - 4 ) and nss ( 4u0614 + 09 , 4u1705 - 44 , ford et al .",
    "the amplitude of these tls is typically 20 ms at 1 hz for nss and bhs ( ford et al .",
    "the origin of these tls is currently under debate .",
    "uniform comptonization models predicting constant tls are however ruled out by the data .",
    "comptonization in a non - uniform medium might account for the observed tls ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) , but in this case , their magnitude implies that the comptonizing cloud extends to very large radii , which in turn poses an energy problem .",
    "recently , poutanen and fabian ( 1999 ) have proposed a `` magnetic flare '' model that could reproduce the observed pds and tl magnitude without requiring a large size region .    using proprietary and archival rxte / pca data ,",
    "we have initiated a systematic study of tls from nss , with the aim of determining whether tls were associated with a singular spectral and/or timing state .",
    "we characterize the spectral state of a source using color - color diagrams ( ccds ) . for the timing state ,",
    "we compute the pds over a broad x - ray energy band ( 2 - 40 kev ) . to start with",
    ", we have selected two nss that are always in a low state ( 2 , , barret et al . 2000 ) , and two that are more variable ; undergoing occasionally low states ( , ) .",
    "for the latter sources , we have sampled both their low and high states .",
    "their low state pds are typical of `` island '' state pds , being characterized by a flat top below  and a broad qpo - like feature in the declining part of the pds above  ( at ) .",
    "tls were computed using the techniques described in nowak et al .",
    "( 1999a ) between the 7 - 40 kev hard and 2 - 7 kev soft photons .",
    "figure 1 shows the ccd of the four sources . fig . 2 shows the corresponding pds ( top ) and tl spectra ( bottom ) .",
    "tls were detected only from  and , and in their lowest / hardest intensity states ( namely their `` island '' state ) .",
    "this is the first report of tls from .",
    "no tls were detected in their high states , with upper limits of 0.1 - 0.01 seconds between 1 and 10 hz ; i.e. a factor of 10 larger than the values detected during their low states .",
    "no tls were detected from the two steady low state sources , and the upper limits we derived are lower than the observed values for  and , indicating that the non detection of similar tls is not due to a lack of sensitivity .",
    "looking at fig . 1 and 2 , a few points can be drawn .",
    "first , tls are not associated with a singular spectral state ;  and 2  occupy the same region of the ccd , and only the former shows tls .",
    "second , although the overall shape of their pds is broadly similar , there is one noticeable difference that shows up very clearly in the @xmath2 representation of the pdss ; that tls are associated with a timing state in which the whole pds is shifted towards high frequencies (  and  are a factor of 10 larger for  and  than for 2  and ) .",
    "third , when  and  are high , tls are significantly detected at frequencies between  and up to or slightly above .",
    "fourth , although of lower significance than the effect observed in the two bhs cyg x-1 and gx339 - 4 ( nowak et al .",
    "1999a , b ) , there is an indication that the tl decreases with frequency , especially for .",
    "finally , tls do not depend upon the intensity of the aperiodic variability , as the four pdss of fig 2 .",
    "have comparable integrated rms ( ranging from 17 to 25% in the 2 - 40 kev band ) .",
    "we have discovered tls in the low state of , and confirmed the previous detection of tls from  ( ford et al .",
    "1999 ) . in our attempt to associate the presence of tls with a singular spectral state",
    ", we have shown that for the same spectral state ( same position in the ccd ) some sources do have tls whereas some do not .",
    "the presence of tls must thus be tracked somewhere else .    despite having a limited sample ,",
    "we have found that tls are detected when the characteristic low state pds shows excess power at high frequencies ( with a  @xmath1 hz instead of @xmath3 hz ) .",
    "recently , pottschmidt et al . ( 2000 ) showed that the shot relaxation time in the hard state of cyg x-1 ( scaling as @xmath4 ) anticorrelates with the tl amplitude .",
    "we can not test the presence of this effect within the data set used here .",
    "however , if the same anticorrelation applies to nss , it could provide an explanation for the non detection of smaller tls from the sources with the lowest . if  and  are somehow related to the position of the inner disk radius within the corona , as possibly suggested by recent observations ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2000 ) , the closer the disk gets to the central object ( i.e the deeper inside the corona ) , and the larger the tls are . in this picture , it is interesting to note that this subtle change in the accretion geometry is not reflected in the ccd , implying similar parameters for the comptonizing cloud and input seed photon energy for all sources .    to conclude , the above study , although not addressing the origin of the tl itself has provided some hints about the conditions under which they are produced . further work is needed to determine whether tls are indeed always associated with the peculiar timing state described in this paper . confirming this result would be extremely valuable for constraining any theoretical models attempting to reproduce the tl properties of these systems .",
