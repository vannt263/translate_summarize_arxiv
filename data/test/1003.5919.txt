    "the recent observations of the large area telescope ( lat ) on board of fermi of gev emission ( 100mev - 50gev ) from grbs revealed an interesting pattern . the gev emission is delayed relative to the onset of the prompt mev emission @xcite . it shows a constant power - law decay long after the prompt emission dies out @xcite . while surprising at first , one may recall that a  precursor \" of these observations was made already by egret that detected an @xmath2 gev photon 90 minutes after the burst in grb 940217 @xcite and a rising late gev spectral component in grb 941017 @xcite .",
    "this pattern suggests that the bulk of the gev emission arises from an external shock afterglow @xcite . while a detectable high energy external shock emission was expected for a long time @xcite and it was noted that external shock synchrotron emission may be the strongest afterglow gev component ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , the observation that this may be the dominant gev emission over the whole burst , including the prompt phase , were surprising .    following these observations",
    "@xcite proposed a revolutionary model in which they revise a critical component of the standard external shock scenario .",
    "they suggest that there is no magnetic field amplification beyond the usual shock compression .",
    "namely , the downstream ( shocked ) magnetic field is just @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is bulk lorentz factor behind the shock ) times the upstream circum burst field . in doing",
    "so they are able to fit the overall afterglow spectrum ( ranging from optical to gev ) , as the low magnetic field in the emitting region quenches the lower energy emission .",
    "additionally they get rid of a nagging theoretical problem - how are the fields amplified @xcite ?    the magnetic field plays a triple role in the synchrotron - shock acceleration mechanism .",
    "it accelerates the electrons and confines them to the shock , while they are accelerated and it also controls the synchrotron emission .",
    "a weaker magnetic fields poses two challenges to the model : cooling and confinement .",
    "first , a comparison of the acceleration and the cooling times sets an absolute limit on the energy of synchrotron photon in the radiating fluid frame .",
    "together with the hydrodynamics of the decelerating blast wave this puts a time dependent limit on the maximal energy of observed synchrotron photons .",
    "photons above this limit are ( almost certainly ) not emitted by external shock synchrotron .",
    "efficient cooling poses another limit on the model .",
    "a significant ( though not dominant ) amount of energy is emitted in the gev emission .",
    "this implies that the emitting electrons must be fast cooling .",
    "otherwise the system would be inefficient and the energy requirement unreasonable . as the cooling takes place mostly in the downstream region this last condition constrains the magnetic field there . while our original motivation was to examine the  unamplified \" magnetic field scenario",
    "our analysis is more general and we allow for an amplification factor .",
    "we show that the observations of a significant gev flux poses strong limits on the downstream magnetic field .",
    "these limits can be translated to limits on the upstream circum burst field ( in the case of no amplification ) or on the amplification factor .",
    "confinement is most important in the upstream region , where the magnetic field is weakest .",
    "thus , observations of gev photons limit the upstream magnetic field with a weak dependence on field amplification in the shock .",
    "finally we turn to the influence of inverse compton ( ic ) cooling on the observed gev emission . given the strong low energy ( ir - optical ) radiation fields ( from the prompt , reverse shock and the forwards shock itself ) , the magnetic field density should be strong enough in order that ic cooling wo nt quench the gev emission .",
    "this sets yet another , independent , limits on the downstream magnetic field .",
    "these considerations shed a direct light on the magnetic fields which are among the most elusive parameters of the external shock model .",
    "note that here we derive constraints assuming that the external shock is adiabatic .",
    "if it is radiative ( as suggested e.g. , by @xcite ) then the constraints will be more stringent .",
    "we examine in this letter these limits that arise from the gev emission .",
    "we do nt attempt to provide a complete solution to the whole multiwavelength afterglow .",
    "as such our analysis is very general and it depends only on the assumptions of synchrotron process and the blast wave hydrodynamics .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that by equating the synchrotron cooling to the acceleration rate , one can obtain an upper bound on the maximal energy of a synchrotron photon : @xmath5 this limit is in the fluid s rest frame , denoted by  @xmath6 \" .",
    "@xmath7 is planck constant , @xmath8 is the electron rest mass , @xmath9 is the speed of light and @xmath10 is the fine structure constant . the maximal observed energy is larger by the lorentz boost factor from the fluid frame to the observer frame , @xmath11^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of the fluid and @xmath12 is cosine the angle between the fluid velocity and the line - of - sight .",
    "if the emission originates from a decelerating external shock then at any given time the observer receives simultaneously photons emitted from a range of radii and therefore a range of lorentz factors .",
    "the photons observed at a time @xmath13 all satisfy @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the time since the explosion as measured in the source frame and @xmath16 is the shock radius at time @xmath15 . in a circum",
    "burst medium with mass density @xmath17 this condition implies that along the line - of - sight ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) the lorentz boost is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the lorentz factor from any other direction , @xmath12 , ( keeping @xmath13 constant ) is larger , but not necessarily the boost , which satisfies : @xmath21.\\ ] ] maximizing @xmath22 for @xmath23 shows that in a constant density medium(@xmath24 ) , e.g. , interstellar medium ( ism ) , @xmath25 while in a circumburst wind ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 . for a self - similar adiabatic shock that propagates into ism with a constant particle density , @xmath28 , @xmath29^{1/8}$ ] while in a wind with a mass density @xmath30 , @xmath31^{1/4}$ ] @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the blast wave kinetic energy , @xmath33 is the proton mass and @xmath34 is the burst s redshift .",
    "using these expressions we find that the maximal observed energy of a synchrotron photon emitted by an adiabatic external shock during its decelerating phase is : @xmath35 where we use the common notations of @xmath36 , @xmath37 in c.g.s . units , etc .",
    "@xmath28 is the ism density and @xmath38 is the wind parameter in units of @xmath39 .",
    "note that the dependence on the burst s parameters of this rather general condition is very weak .",
    "moreover , even when the burst redshift is unknown this limit peaks at @xmath40 . in principle",
    "this limit can be violated by synchrotron emission in a special magnetic field configuration , for example , if the electrons are accelerated by a weak magnetic field but radiate where the field is strong @xcite .",
    "still , it is unlikely that afterglow photons @xmath41 gev are generated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "such photons were already observed in two bursts .",
    "most notable is grb 940217 , where an @xmath2 gev photon was observed @xmath42 min after the burst by egret @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude larger than the limit of eq .",
    "[ eq hnumax ] at this time , @xmath43 gev .",
    "recently , lat detected a @xmath44 gev photon @xmath45 s after the burst from grb 090902b @xcite .",
    "the observation of one or two photons can not rule out the external shock synchrotron model for gev emission .",
    "nevertheless , these observations set a major difficulty to this model , especially if observations of late afterglow photons much above this limit will continue .",
    "if the observed gev emission arises from synchrotron in an external shock it constrains both the upstream and the downstream magnetic fields .",
    "it constrains the first by the requirement that the radiating electrons are confined to the system .",
    "it also constrains the latter by the requirement that the radiating electrons radiate efficiently and therefore are cooling fast .",
    "the limits are particularly interesting in the case that the downstream field is not amplified beyond the usual shock compression and @xmath46 .",
    "such a case is interesting for this scenario because a rather weak magnetic field is needed in order to suppress the synchrotron mev emission of the forward shock @xcite .",
    "however , in order to consider the most general case , and since ic emission may suppress the mev emission without affecting the gev luminosity , we introduce an amplification factor , @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 . in the following",
    "we presents these constraints using @xmath49 and upstream field , which for abbreviation we denote simply as @xmath50 .",
    "the accelerated electrons have to be confined to the shock region , otherwise they escape .",
    "this sets a second limit on the maximal synchrotron energy .",
    "the confinement criterion on the gyro radius in the upstream of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath51 is : @xmath52 the external shock slows down while it propagates and it wo nt catch the rapid electron by the time it turned @xmath53 but somewhat later ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the confinement factor , @xmath54 .",
    "detailed calculations yield @xmath55 for an ism and 1/2 for a wind , we denote @xmath56 . this last inequality leads to a maximal confined electron s lorentz factor ( in the shock s frame ) : @xmath57 for confinement in the downstream the larmour radius should be compared with the shock s thickness @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting maximal electron lorentz factor is @xmath60 times larger than the one given by eq .",
    "[ conf ] for the upstream .",
    "since the electron has to be confined in both upstream and downstream the comparable or smaller former limit is the critical one .    the synchrotron frequency of electrons in the downstream is larger by a factor of @xmath61 than in the upstream .",
    "therefore the confinement upper limit for synchrotron external shock photons is : @xmath62    the average lorentz factor and the blast wave radius in a constant density environment that corresponds to an observer time @xmath13 are @xcite : @xmath63 and @xmath64 substitution of these expressions into eqs .",
    "[ conf ] and [ syn_conf ] yields : @xmath65 @xmath66 these equations imply that if the observed gev photons were generated by an external shock synchrotron the upstream magnetic field must satisfy : @xmath67    turning now to a wind environment the average lorentz factor and blast wave radius that corresponds to an observer time @xmath13 are @xcite : @xmath68 and @xmath69 a substitution of these expression into eqs .",
    "[ conf ] and [ syn_conf ] yields : @xmath70 @xmath71 the lower loretnz factor and the smaller radius ( at early time ) as compared to an ism leads to a more stringent constrain on the upstream magnetic field of a wind : @xmath72      the conditions found in the previous subsection are sufficient to produce the highest energy photons",
    ". however , the bulk of the energy typically observed in the lat comes at lower energies , around 100 mev . to obtain an efficient , fast cooling , 100 mev emission",
    "one needs the cooling frequency , @xmath73 mev . in both the upstream and downstream frames",
    "the maximal energy , @xmath74 is obtained from the condition @xmath75 , while @xmath76 is obtained from the condition @xmath77 . since cooling",
    "is more efficient in the downstream , comparing the two conditions in the downstream frame implies that @xmath78 ( for which @xmath79 ) satisfies @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "this equation of the cooling frequency is , of course , equivalent to the one obtained by the traditional derivation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , instead of calculating the exact value of @xmath82 we use the normalization of @xmath78 derived by @xcite finding : @xmath83 the wind constrain is again stronger since @xmath76 is lower while @xmath74 is independent of the environment .",
    "the condition @xmath84mev , will impose now : @xmath85 this is a relatively high upstream field and it suggests that either the external density is extremely low or that there is at least some magnetic field amplification at the shock .",
    "the system has some interesting properties when there is no magnetic field amplification .",
    "in such a case the upstream and downstream timescales are comparable to within an order of magnitude and each electron is characterized by only two time scales , its acceleration time , @xmath86 and its cooling time , @xmath87 .",
    "it is the interplay between these two time scales and the dynamical time scale , @xmath88 , together with the requirement that the electron is bound to the system , that determine the critical electron lorentz factors , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the first satisfies @xmath92 .",
    "it is independent of the system dynamical time and as it turns out @xmath74 is also independent of the strength of the magnetic field ( eq . [ emax ] ) .",
    "next , equating @xmath93 results in the maximal lorentz factor an electron can achieve , when cooling and escape are ignored . in our case ,",
    "an electron that satisfies @xmath93 is also the maximal energy of an electron that is confined to the system , thus , @xmath94 .",
    "finally , @xmath91 is the lorentz factor of the electron that cool over the dynamical time , i.e. , @xmath95",
    ". therefore there are two possibilities . if @xmath96 then the maximal electron s energy is limited by cooling , which takes place on shorter time than @xmath88 .",
    "thus , less energetic electrons than @xmath89 can cool over @xmath88 implying @xmath97 . in such case",
    "a break in th espectrum is observed at @xmath78 and a cutoff at @xmath98 , while @xmath76 is not observed . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath99 then the maximal electron s energy is limited by the ability to accelerate and confine the electrons over @xmath88 , where cooling do not play any role .",
    "thus , @xmath100 where @xmath89 and @xmath91 electrons do not exist in the system ( can not be accelerated ) . therefore a cutoff is observed at @xmath76 and @xmath78 and @xmath74 are not observed . for an ism",
    "there is a triple coincidence of the three energies for our canonical parameters when @xmath101 g",
    "so @xmath102 .",
    "so far we have ignored the possible effects of inverse compton ( ic ) cooling on the synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "however , the strong lower energy radiation fields may lead to ic cooling whose effect we consider now .",
    "this radiation field may be the external forward shock synchrotron field , but it may also be any other source .",
    "the ic cooling may reduce the maximal energy bellow maximal synchrotron energy ( eq .",
    "[ emax ] ) .",
    "it leads to an implicit equation for the new ( lower ) maximal energy : @xmath103 } , \\label{emaxic } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the compton parameter in the downstream ( where the dominant cooling takes place ) and @xmath105 is the lorentz factor of the electrons whose synchrotron frequency is @xmath106 . clearly , for efficient gev emission @xmath107 must be smaller than unity and in this case @xmath108 and we recover eq .",
    "[ emax ] . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath109 and @xmath110 and consider what are the conditions for this to hold .",
    "as @xmath89 is extremely high ic scattering is mostly in the klein nishina ( kn ) regime and is ineffective .",
    "still , the radiation field ( in the shock frame ) , @xmath111 , below the relevant kn frequency , @xmath112 : @xmath113 may be large enough leading to an effective compton parameter : @xmath114 one can estimate @xmath111 using a given model for the external shock emission , but given the multi wavelength observations at early time it is much more useful to constrain it directly from the observations .",
    "this is especially important since , at least in the earlier part of the afterglow , other radiation fields ( e.g. prompt emission and reverse shock emission ) co - exist with the external shock and this is the best way to incorporate their contributions . given an observed spectral flux density @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the comoving distance . in the following we measure @xmath115 in units of mjy",
    "( i.e. , @xmath118ergs/@xmath119hz ) .",
    "@xmath120 is the maximal value of @xmath121 at frequencies below @xmath122 .",
    "below we assume that this maximum is at @xmath122 , an assumption that can be tested , and corrected , given the observations .    using eqs .",
    "[ eqgs ] , [ eqrs ] , [ eqgw ] and [ eqrw ] we find that @xmath123 is typically in the ir when there is no strong field amplification : @xmath124 the relevant y parameter assuming @xmath125 peaks at @xmath122 is : @xmath126 additionally , in order to produce efficiently the emission observed by lat at @xmath127 mev , the corresponding electrons can not be cooled effectively via ic , and the compton parameter should be small .",
    "the relevant kn frequency is : @xmath128 and assuming @xmath125 peaks at @xmath122 the compton @xmath104 is : @xmath129 therefore , if there is no strong field amplification a modest ir - optical flux of a few mjy for an ism and 10 @xmath12jy for a wind is enough to suppress the gev flux .",
    "therefore a clear test of the external shock synchrotron gev emission , without field amplification is that we should not observe a strong optical flux at the time when we observe gev emission .",
    "a simultaneous detection of a strong optical emission and a gev emission will rule out this model .",
    "although we do not consider here a complete model for the external shock synchrotron emission it is important to note that when such model is constructed kn effects should be carefully considered .",
    "the reason is that if the magnetic field is not amplified close to equipartition level then the radiation energy density is much larger than the magnetic field energy density in the downstream frame .",
    "ic by electrons emitting the mev - gev emission will certainly be in the kn regime , but over a large range of the parameter phase the y parameter of these fast cooling electrons ( which now depends on the electron energy ) will be larger than 1 . in which case the synchrotron spectrum will be altered significantly @xcite .",
    "an extreme example to a kn effect may be apparent if there is no field amplification at all .",
    "in such case @xmath122 of the fast cooling electrons is below the the typical synchrotron frequency @xmath74.if their compton parameter is smaller than unity and the synchrotron emission is not strongly affected .",
    "but , once @xmath104 becomes larger than @xmath130 for fast cooling electrons , the back - reaction of the ic emission on the electrons distribution results in the cooling frequency `` jumping '' on a short time scale by orders of magnitude , significantly revising the whole synchrotron spectrum @xcite .",
    "using the confinement and cooling conditions we have obtained limits on the values of the magnetic fields needed in the downstream and upstream regions in order to produce the observed grb gev emission via an external shock synchrotron .",
    "these constrains are based on minimal assumptions of synchrotron cooling and blast wave hydrodynamics .",
    "both are essential ingredients of the external shock synchrotron model .",
    "the arguments we present allow us to explore directly the magnetic fields in both upstream and downstream regions , which are among the least constrained physical parameters of the model .",
    "we find that with no amplification the minimal fields required are on the high end ( @xmath131 g ) , unless the external density is very low .",
    "the limits are even higher for a radiative solution .",
    "it is , of course , possible that this is a condition for gev emission .",
    "however , the detection of gev emission from all mev bright grbs that are within the lat viewing angle suggests that the emission is generic . in this case",
    "at least a modest amplification is probably needed .    finally , we point out two critical predictions of the external shock synchrotron model : ( i ) no detection of late very energetic ( @xmath132 gev ) photons and ( ii ) no simultaneous detection of a bright ( @xmath133mjy ) ir - optical ( depending on the specific case ) signal with the gev photons unless the upstream magnetic field is strongly amplified in the shock",
