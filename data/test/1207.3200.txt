    "the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) articulated by penrose @xcite is fundamental to many aspects of theory and astrophysical applications of black hole physics today . despite many attempts over past decades no theoretical proof or even any satisfactory mathematical formulation of ccc is available as of today in the case of dynamical gravitational collapse . in the mean time , many authors have studied mainly spherical gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud within the framework of general relativity . as the nuclear fuel of a massive star exhausts , it loses its equilibrium and gravity becomes the central dominant force which lends the star to its perpetual collapse .",
    "the gravitational collapse studies then show that the collapse end state is either a black hole ( bh ) or a naked singularity ( ns ) , depending on the nature of the initial data from which the collapse evolves , arising from a regular initial state to the final super dense state @xcite .",
    "the works such as above analyze physically relevant general matter fields that include most of the known physical forms of matter like dust , perfect fluids , and such others .",
    "wide classes of solutions to einstein equations are shown in these cases to exist where the collapse end state is a black hole or naked singularity depending on the nature of initial data and the collapse evolutions allowed by the einstein equations subject to regularity and physical reasonability conditions .",
    "an equation of state for the matter is , however , not always assumed in many of these investigations . as such , the physical characteristics of the matter field constituting the star are described by an equation of state relating the density and pressures , and therefore it is important to know if the naked singularities would still form when a suitable equation of state is assumed for the collapsing cloud .",
    "but it is to be noted that such an equation of state is not precisely known for a collapsing massive star which will be assuming super dense states of matter closer to the final later stages of the collapse , where the physical region has ultra - high densities , energies and pressures .",
    "it is far from clear as of now what would be a physically realistic equation of state that would describe such an ultra - high density region of collapse , and also whether the equation of state would remain unchanged or it would actually evolve and change as the collapse develops .    nevertheless it is important to understand the final fate of a gravitational collapse when a suitable equation of state is assumed , and to know if the naked singularities still form as collapse final states .",
    "one can thus choose the equation of state to be linear isentropic or polytropic to describe the collapse of a massive star , right after its departure from the equilibrium configuration where gravity was balanced by the nuclear reactions taking place at the core region of the star .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid with a linear equation of state is of interest from both theoretical as well as numerical relativity perspectives .",
    "our motivation also comes from certain other questions such as , what if the value of @xmath1 increases in the range @xmath2 when a naked singularity appears as collapse final state for a given spacetime dimension and for a critical positive tangent to the singularity curve as to be discussed below .",
    "in such a case will the singularity sustain its nature , or a formation of event horizon shall precede the formation of singularity to preserve the ccc ?",
    "we believe as answer to these and similar issues would be important to understand better the physical conditions for collapse and the role of an equation of state towards providing a suitable mathematical and physical formulation of ccc .",
    "we therefore consider here a linear isentropic equation of state , @xmath3 in the study of spherical gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid .",
    "self - similar perfect fluid collapse models with a linear equation of state were considered through numerical simulations by ori and piran @xcite and analytically by joshi and dwivedi @xcite to show how black holes and naked singularities develop as collapse final states in this scenario .",
    "further , goswami and joshi @xcite studied the case of an isentropic perfect fluid with a linear equation of state in four dimensional spacetime without the self - similarity assumption , wherein they showed that the occurrence of bh and ns evolving from regular initial data depends on the choice of rest of the free functions available .",
    "it was also proved that in a general @xmath4-dimensional dust collapse , the occurrence of ns can be removed when one goes to a higher dimensional spacetime , thus restoring ccc @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied spherically symmetric collapse of a fluid with a non - vanishing radial pressure in higher dimensional spacetimes with an equation of state @xmath5 using the construction of the joshi - dwivedi root equation that governs the nature ( bh versus ns ) of the central singularity .",
    "also other cases of collapse with pressure have been studied by various authors to understand the collapse final fate @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to give an explicit class of collapse models for the perfect fluid case with a linear equation of state , and to analyze the same for the collapse end states in terms of formation of black holes and naked singularities .",
    "we analyze here the marginally bound case for the sake of simplicity and transparency and the results show that bh and ns form for a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath1 in the equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of work is as follows : in section ii , we study einstein field equations for spherically symmetric metric .",
    "we obtain the function @xmath6 as a class of solutions to the constraint equation that enters through dynamical equations for @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of collapse for occurrence of ns / bh phases due to the effect of regular initial data is studied in the subsection ii.1 .",
    "the implication of the function @xmath6 on singularity curve is investigated , which corroborate the study of apparent horizon in section iii .",
    "the occurrence of ns / bh phases is investigated for increasing value of the parameter @xmath1 , providing illustration of its behavior in subsections iii.1 and iii.2 .",
    "the conclusions are specified in section iv .",
    "the general spherically symmetric metric describing spacetime geometry of a collapsing cloud can be described in comoving coordinates  @xmath8 by the metric , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metric on a two - sphere .",
    "we aim here at the question , whether the choice of an equation of state @xmath11 , @xmath12 $ ] contributes through the parameter @xmath1 in the development of bh / ns phases .",
    "the stress - energy tensor for the type i matter fields , and in particular for perfect fluids , is in a diagonal form in a comoving coordinate system and is given by @xcite , @xmath13 the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energy density and pressure respectively .",

    ", we have @xmath28 , that is , the mass function has to vanish at the center of the cloud . since we are considering collapse , we have @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ the physical radius @xmath30 of the collapsing cloud keeps decreasing in time and ultimately it reaches @xmath31 , which denotes the spacetime singularity where all the matter shells collapse to a zero physical radius .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us define a new function @xmath36 by @xmath37 , and now we use the scaling independence of the comoving coordinate @xmath24 to write @xmath38 this gives @xmath39 and the collapse condition is now written as @xmath40 .",
    "the time @xmath41 corresponds to the shell - focusing singularity at @xmath31 , where all the matter shells collapse to a vanishing physical radius .",
    "the introduction of the parameter @xmath42 as above allows us to distinguish the genuine spacetime singularity from the regular center at @xmath43 , with @xmath44 at the initial epoch including the center @xmath45 , and @xmath42 then decreases monotonically with time as collapse progresses to the value @xmath46 at the singularity @xmath31 . at the regular center",
    "the mass function @xmath47 behaves suitably so that the density remains finite and regular there at all times till the occurrence of singular epoch . from the einstein equation for density , we see that the mass function for the cloud can be written in general as , @xmath48 where @xmath6 is regular and continuously twice differentiable . using equation ( [ dsm12 ] ) in equations ( [ dsfe05 ] ) , we obtain @xmath49 } { v^{2 } ( v + r v ' ) }      =    - \\frac { m _ { , v } } { k \\ v^{2}}.   \\label { dsm13}\\ ] ] then as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , _ i.e. _ both the density and pressure blow up at the singularity .",

    "this means that the energy conditions and equation of state @xmath11 isolate the class of functions @xmath55 so that the mass function @xmath56 , the metric function @xmath57 and other concerned functions of @xmath42 evolve as the collapse begins according to the type i field equations .    to obtain such a class of solutions , we consider here the ansatz",

    "therefore , we can choose a physically relevant @xmath61 as given by , @xmath62 as a solution of equation ( [ dsv14.1 ] ) , where @xmath63 is a positive constant and the choice of the function @xmath64 should be such that integrand of equation ( [ sod15.1 ] ) should be at least piecewise continuous on @xmath65 $ ] and also we note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath54 , @xmath68 . also at @xmath43 ,",

    "the key factor that determines this final outcome is the geometry of the trapped surfaces . if the trapped surfaces developed early enough in collapse , well before the formation of the singularity , then a black hole is the collapse final state . on the other hand , when the trapped surface formation is delayed as the collapse evolves , due to the internal dynamics of the collapsing cloud , in that case the singularity is no longer fully covered by an event horizon , and we can have light rays and material particles escaping away from an arbitrary vicinity of the same , thus giving rise to a naked singularity .    to decide and understand this trapped surface geometry , we need to determine the behavior of the singularity curve in the spacetime , which describes how and when different collapsing shells arrive at the zero physical radius , thus forming the spacetime singularity .    to determine this , firstly on integrating equation ( [ dsfe06 ] ) , we obtain the general metric function , @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",

    "since the term @xmath146 , and with the suitable continuity of the functions involved in the integrand of equation ( [ ch201 ] ) , the sign of the term @xmath147 totally depends on the behavior of the term @xmath148 . therefore the positive or negative sign of @xmath141 , for various values of @xmath129 , depends on the behavior of the functions @xmath149 , and @xmath140 .",
    "we also note that the positive constant @xmath63 appearing in the mass function @xmath47 is related with density by the expression @xmath150 .",

    "the significance of the term @xmath152 towards deciding the visibility or otherwise of the final spacetime singularity is as follows . as seen by the equation for @xmath111 above for the singularity curve",
    ", this term and its sign basically decides the behavior of the singularity curve away from the center .",
    "in particular , when the singularity curve is increasing , it is shown that the apparent horizon which begins also at the central singularity at @xmath43 , is increasing necessarily , and therefore it follows that there is no formation of trapped surfaces as the gravitational collapse of the matter cloud evolves , all the way till the singularity formation epoch .",
    "in such a case , as has been shown earlier @xcite , the singularity is necessarily locally naked and a family of future directed null ( and also timelike ) geodesics come out which terminate in the past at the singularity .",
    "such a singularity can also be globally visible depending on the nature of the mass function away from the center @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when the singularity curve is constant ( @xmath153 and other higher order terms are all vanishing ) , or would be decreasing , then a black hole will necessarily form as the collapse final state .",
    "basically , a naked singularity could occur when a comoving observer ( at a fixed radius @xmath24 ) does not encounter any trapped surfaces until the time of singularity formation . on the other hand , for a black hole the trapped surfaces form before the singularity .",
    "thus for a black hole to form we require , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the epoch at which the central shell hits the singularity . in the general case this condition is violated when @xmath156 as seen from the equation for @xmath111 above . the apparent horizon curve that initiates at the singularity @xmath43 at the epoch @xmath155 , then increases with increasing @xmath24 , moving to the future and we have @xmath157 for @xmath158 near the center .",
    "the behavior of the outgoing families of null geodesics has been analyzed in detail in these cases , and it is known that the geodesics terminate at the singularity in the past , which results in a naked singularity . in such cases then the extreme strong gravity regions can communicate with external observers .",
    "as these aspects are already discussed earlier as cited above , we therefore mainly focus here on determining the behavior of the quantity @xmath153 for the perfect fluid collapse with an equation of state @xmath0 , and we examine the impact of changing the values of the parameter @xmath1 on the visibility or otherwise of the singularity .      we note that for the well - studied case of the dust collapse , we have @xmath159 at @xmath160 and the mrc reduces to the form  @xmath161 .",
    "we have @xmath162 in this case a naked singularity exists for the given initial data of mass function .",
    "the radiation collapse can be considered through the case @xmath163 for which the mrc takes the form @xmath164 and we have @xmath165 and @xmath166 \\hspace{0.2 in } \\label{chi1302 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the bracketed term has varying sign , we find that @xmath167 for small positive values of @xmath63 , and for higher values of @xmath63 , @xmath141 changes its sign .    in general , to understand the nature of @xmath141 in the interval @xmath129 , we can obtain expressions for @xmath141 for different values of @xmath1 in order to see how it changes with a change in the parameter values @xmath1 .",
    "the graph of @xmath141 for various specific @xmath1 values is given in fig.3 .",
    "the equation of apparent horizon in a spherically symmetric spacetime is given by  @xmath168 .",
    "use of equations ( [ dsm12 ] ) and ( [ sod15 ] ) give us the expression @xmath169 it is clear that as @xmath54 , we must have @xmath68 on the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore , the only singularity that can eventually be visible is that at the center of the collapsing cloud . certainly , it is not possible to satisfy @xmath170 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath171 near the singularity and away from center , that is with @xmath172 .",
    "it follows that the region surrounding the singularity can not be timelike , and therefore any singularity that might eventually form near the center with @xmath172 must not be visible .",
    "the investigation of gravitational collapse with a linear equation of state has revealed role of the parameter @xmath1 in deciding the nature of central singularity for the given initial data set of the mass function @xmath6 .",
    "we examined here the marginally bound case with @xmath173 .",
    "in particular , we gave here an explicit class of mass functions that satisfies the einstein equations and the metric obtained represents a class of solutions for a unique choice of functions @xmath64 , representing the exact solution for a perfect fluid sphere collapse with an isentropic equation of state .",
    "the occurrence of a locally naked singularity as collapse end state is shown for these collapse models for a wide variety of values of @xmath129 , and also formation of black hole is seen for a range of @xmath1 values for this class of mass functions which are an appropriate choice of @xmath6 that are solutions to the einstein field equations .",
    "we thus see , through an explicit demonstration , that both black holes and naked singularities arise naturally as collapse final states for perfect fluid collapse with a linear isentropic equation of state .",
    "the class of solutions we gave here have several intriguing properties some of which we discussed here .",
    "it is thus seen that the choice of @xmath129 influences and contributes to decide in the formation of ns / bh phases of gravitational collapse .",
