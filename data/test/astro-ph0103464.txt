    "perhaps the most noteworthy of recent findings in extragalactic globular cluster ( gc ) research is the discovery of bimodal color distributions in the gc systems of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "bimodality is taken to indicate the presence of two distinct gc subpopulations .",
    "there are at least three scenarios for producing bimodal color distributions in the gc systems of elliptical galaxies . _",
    "i ) _ the merger of two gas  rich ( spiral ) galaxies may lead to the formation of an elliptical galaxy and create an additional population of gcs in the process ( schweizer 1987 , ashman & zepf 1992 ) . since the population produced in the merger formed from enriched gas it should be of higher metallicity and redder than the indigenous population . here",
    "the expectation is that the age of the red clusters should be similar to the epoch of the merger event .",
    "note that , according to worthey ( 1994 ) stellar population models , this second metal ",
    "rich population will always be redder in ( u  v ) than the old metal ",
    "poor population if it is older than @xmath01 gyr but it will be redder in ( b  i ) only if it is older than @xmath02 gyr . _",
    "ii ) _ a multi  phase collapse ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) can also produce a bimodal color distribution with the blue clusters forming in an early chaotic phase of galaxy formation from metal - poor gas and the red clusters forming a few gyr later from enriched gas in the same phase that produces the bulk of the galaxy starlight . _",
    "iii ) _ cot , marzke & west ( 1998 ) describe the build - up of the gc systems of bright ellipticals via the accretion of mostly metal - poor gcs from dwarf galaxies in this third picture the red gcs are indigenous and the blue ones acquired .",
    "these three scenarios predict a different separation in age between the red and blue gcs .",
    "the merger model predicts an old population ( @xmath0age of the universe ) plus a young population with the age of the merger .",
    "a multi  phase collapse also has an old population and one slightly younger ( @xmath024 gyr younger ) than the other .",
    "the accretion scenario predicts that the age distribution of the blue and the red gcs will be similar unless a recent merger product has been accreted .",
    "the key to discriminating between these possibilities is to determine ages and metallicities for both the blue and red gc subpopulations . in principle spectroscopy",
    "is the best way to determine age and metallicity independently , however this requires very high signal - to - noise data which is rarely available for extragalactic gcs .",
    "alternatively one can use the difference in colour of the two subpopulations , from photometry , to _ constrain _ the age .",
    "the latter method has only been applied to a small number of galaxies ( whitmore et al .",

    "both galaxies reveal signs of a recent merger or interaction , and are therefore ideal candidates to search for young gcs .",

    "the centre of the galaxy was kept fixed and a @xmath5 clipping algorithm was employed .",
    "bright objects , as well as the central saturated parts of the galaxy , were masked out .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) and ellipticity ( @xmath6 ) were fit at each radius , until s / n constraints terminated the fitting process at low surface brightness .",

    "similar profiles and trends are seen in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band images .",
    "to detect sources superimposed on the galaxies we first subtracted the galaxy light from both ngc 1052 and 7332 using a median filter and then followed the techniques described in georgakakis et al .",
    "briefly , sources are detected using the sextractor package ( version 2.1.0 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) with a threshold of 2.5@xmath10 . after detecting sources in the three filters separately ,",
    "they are matched to create a list of common detections .",
    "magnitudes were calculated using 5@xmath11 apertures plus small aperture corrections to reach the total derived magnitude .    from the list of common detections ,",

    "the mean photometric error at these magnitude limits is about @xmath21mag for all three filters",
    ". the galaxy background does not significantly affect the completeness limits beyond a galactocentric radius of @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noted that including gcs brighter than the @xmath23 completeness limit for point sources does not change any of our conclusions .    the bright magnitude is set to be about 1 mag .",
    "brighter than omega cen ( the brightest gc in our galaxy ) at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "sources brighter than this are most likely stars .",

    "after these various selection cuts we have 359 gc candidates in ngc 1052 and 154 in ngc 7332 .",

    "lines in these plots show the colour and magnitude limits described above .",
    "although we attempt to minimise the fraction of foreground stars and background galaxies in the final gc sample , it is likely that a number of contaminating sources are also selected .",
    "details of how we estimate the contamination level in our keck images can be found in georgakakis et al .",
    "briefly , we used the galaxy model developed by bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) to estimate the contamination by foreground stars . after applying the same magnitude and colour selection ,",
    "the galaxy model predicts a total of about @xmath26 10 stars in the ngc 1052 gc sample and 24 in ngc 7332 .",
    "thus it both cases the number of contaminating stars in the final sample is negligible and will not effect our conclusions .",
    "the number of background galaxies in our images are estimated from the galaxy count studies of lilly , cowie & gardner ( 1991 ) . from the number of predicted galaxies ( within our colour and magnitude range , and field - of - view )",
    ", we subtract the number of resolved objects suggesting a total of about 70 galaxies .",
    "thus the contamination from relatively compact galaxies is estimated to be 19% for ngc 1052 and 45% for ngc 7332 .",
    "simple simulations in georgakakis ( 2000 ) suggest that these contamination rates are an overestimate and the true rate is somewhat less than this .",
    "we return to the issue of contamination in section 5.2 .",
    "the colour distribution for the final ngc 1052 gc sample is plotted in figure [ n1052hist ] .",
    "there is evidence for bimodality with peaks in the distribution at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is confirmed by the kmm statistical test ( ashman 1994 ) which rejects the single gaussian model at a confidence level better than @xmath29 .",
    "although the exact location of the peaks depend on which gcs at the extremes of the distribution are excluded , the difference in the peaks is nearly constant at around @xmath30b ",
    "i = 0.4 @xmath31 0.1 , where the error is estimated assuming an estimated uncertainty of 0.07 mag in defining the peaks of the bimodal distribution .",
    "also shown in figure [ n1052hist ] is the reddening  corrected colour distribution of galactic gcs .",
    "the blue peak of the ngc 1052 gcs is similar to that of the milky way gc distribution , which is dominated by halo gcs .",
    "the kmm test finds roughly equal numbers of blue and red gcs .",
    "the contamination from background galaxies ( i.e. 19% ) is unlikely to significantly alter the results . in particular",
    ", the detection of bimodality in the ngc 1052 gc system should be robust .",
    "if we assume that the gcs comprise two distinct subpopulations of different age and metallicity but with the same initial mass function , then we can use the separation in the peak colours to constrain the age and metallicity .",
    "we further assume that the blue ( older ) subpopulation has properties similar to those of the milky way gc system and therefore consists of old ( 15 gyrs ) metal  poor ( @xmath32=-1.5}$ ] ) gcs ( this is a reasonable assumption given the similarity in colour seen in figure [ n1052hist ] ) . here",
    "we employ the models of worthey ( 1994 ) to predict the colour difference between the red ( younger ) gc population and the old , metal ",
    "poor one .    the model predictions for the b ",
    "i colour difference versus age of the red subpopulation for different metallicities are shown in figure [ n1052model ] .",
    "the measured colour difference in the peaks from the kmm statistical test is @xmath33 , where the error is estimated assuming an uncertainty of 0.07 mag in defining the peaks of the bimodal distribution .    in figure [ n1052rad ]",
    "we show the trend of gc colours with galactocentric radius .",
    "the mean gc colour for the whole system appears to getter bluer with increased distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "however the mean colour of the blue ( 1.1 @xmath24 b ",
    "i @xmath24 1.7 ) and red ( 1.7 @xmath24 b ",
    "i @xmath24 2.3 ) subpopulations are fairly constant with radius .",
    "this suggests that the changing mean colour is due to a changing relative mix of red and blue gcs with radius , rather than any instrinsic radial gradient .",
    "i profile for the galaxy starlight is also shown in fig .",
    "[ n1052rad ] .",
    "it remains fairly constant at b ",
    "i @xmath0 2.2 .    for the same blue and red subpopulations ,",
    "we have examined their azimuthal distribution . in figure [ n1052pa ]",
    "we show histograms of position angle for gcs within 210 arcsec .",
    "both subpopulations show a slight tendency for the gcs to have an excess at a position angle similar to the galaxy major axis ( and a deficit along the galaxy minor axis ) . this effect is stronger for the red gcs .",
    "the surface density profile of gcs around ngc 1052 has been estimated in the following way . from objects detected in the v band image",
    ", we selected point sources ( based on their fwhm and visual inspection ) brighter than the @xmath14 completeness limit . using detections in a single band , instead of the colour selected gc sample , makes the selection criteria easier to quantify .",
    "these objects are then binned into elliptical rings centered on ngc 1052 and having the same mean ellipticity ( i.e. 0.2 ) and position angle ( i.e. 115@xmath34 ) as the galaxy .",
    "the counts in each bin are corrected for geometric incompleteness due to foreground saturated stars , bad columns and the limited size of the field  of  view ( but we have not yet corrected these counts for magnitude incompleteness ) . the surface density profile corresponding to these counts in shown on the left of figure [ n1052dens ] .",
    "it is clear that the counts decline from the galaxy centre , confirming that the vast bulk of objects are indeed associated with ngc 1052 .",
    "after statistically subtracting the background from the number of v band detected objects and after corrections for geometric and magnitude incompleteness ( assuming v@xmath35 = 23.90 and @xmath36 = 1.15 ) , we estimate 410 @xmath31 45 globular clusters in the lris frame .",
    "integration of the surface density profile ( assuming a constant density at small radii ) returns a similar number of gcs , i.e. 390 .",
    "we adopt 400 as the total number of gcs ( i.e. covering all radii and magnitudes ) .    by calculating the _ incompleteness _ in each radial bin and assuming a standard milky way gc luminosity function , we correct the number counts .",
    "we also subtract a background level , which at large radii is estimated to be @xmath37 .",
    "the incompleteness - corrected and background - subtracted surface density profile is shown in the right side of figure [ n1052dens ] .",
    "a fit to the profile indicates a slope of @xmath38 .",
    "earlier work by harris & hanes ( 1985 ) found a gc surface density slope of @xmath39 .",
    "we adopt a total gc system for ngc 1052 of 400 @xmath31 45 , this translates into a specific frequency of s@xmath40 = 3.2 @xmath31 0.37 . in a previous ground - based study ,",
    "harris & hanes ( 1985 ) estimated a total gc population of 430 @xmath31 80 for ngc 1052 .",
    "also shown on the right hand side of figure [ n1052dens ] is the normalized surface brightness profile of ngc 1052 .",
    "the gc density profile shows a similar decrease with radius as the starlight .",
    "the density profile separated into red and blue gc subpopulations is shown in figure [ denrb ] .",
    "the red gcs are slightly more centrally concentrated than the blue gcs .",
    "the colour distribution for the final ngc 7332 gc sample is plotted in figure [ n7332contam ] .",
    "there is evidence for bimodality with the peaks of the distribution at @xmath41 and @xmath42 . after rejecting a few of the reddest objects",
    ", the kmm test rejects the single gaussian model at a confidence level better than @xmath43 , and indicates a @xmath30b ",
    "thus we have tentative evidence for bimodality .",
    "contamination by background galaxies , and to some extent foreground stars , is more of an issue for ngc 7332 . for the final sample of 154 objects , we estimate that 45% may be galaxies and 15% stars .",
    "figure [ n7332contam ] also shows the expected colour distribution of galaxies , superposed on that for the gc candidates .",
    "foreground stars have a very broad colour distribution and so do not significantly modify the observed candidate gc colour distribution .",
    "background galaxies , however , have similar colours .",
    "in particular , a significant fraction of the red peak objects are probably galaxies .",
    "we subtract the galaxy colour distribution , and show the residual gc colour distribution in figure [ n7332hist ] . a narrow peak at b ",
    "i @xmath0 1.5 remains , while the red distribution becomes much broader and less well defined .",
    "we also show in figure [ n7332hist ] is the reddening  corrected colour distribution of galactic gcs . like",
    "ngc 1052 , the blue peak of the ngc 7332 gcs is similar to that of the milky way gc distribution ( which is dominated by halo gcs ) .",
    "given the similarity to the milky way colour distribution and the small number of blue galaxies , the reality of the blue gc peak seems fairly secure .",
    "however it is more difficult to be confident about the red peak .",
    "there are too few sources to investigate the red ones separately with any confidence .",
    "we proceed assuming that ngc 7332 does indeed have two gc subpopulations but any results should be regarded as tentative at best .",
    "following the same assumptions as above for ngc 1052 , we can investigate the age and metallicity of the possible two gc subpopulations in ngc 7332 .",
    "again , relative to old ( 15 gyrs ) , metal  poor ( @xmath32=-1.5}$ ] ) gcs , the age of the red gcs can be constrained from the measured colour difference of @xmath44 ( we have assumed @xmath310.1 for the individual peak colours ) . this color difference and",
    "the models of worthey ( 1994 ) are shown in figure [ n7332model ] .    in figure 14",
    "we show the surface density distribution of gc candidates around ngc 7332 .",
    "this has been carried out in a similar way to ngc 1052 , i.e. using the v band image we correct the counts in elliptical bins for geometric incompleteness and the limited field - of - view .",
    "these counts are converted into surface density and shown in the left panel of figure 14 .",
    "after background subtraction and correction for magnitude incompleteness , we derive the profile shown in the right panel .",
    "a fit to the final surface density profile indicates a slope @xmath45 = 1.50 @xmath31 0.23 .",
    "the background level is estimated at @xmath46 . subtracting this from the v band detections ( after corrections for geometry , magnitude incompleteness etc ) leaves 164 @xmath31 35 objects .",
    "integration of the surface density profile ( assuming a constant density at small radii ) returns a slightly higher estimate of 219 gcs .",
    "if we adopt 190 @xmath31 30 as the total gc system , then it implies a specific frequency of s@xmath40 = 2.0 @xmath31 0.3 .",
    "we attempted to separate the density profile into the blue and red subpopulations .",
    "they show little difference , but do confirm that both subpopulations decline in density from the galaxy centre at least out to 100 arcsec .",
    "this suggests that some fraction of _ both _ the blue and red subpopulations are indeed associated with the galaxy .",
    "this gives us some extra confidence in the reality of the gc colour bimodality .",
    "located in a small group , this e4 galaxy contains an active nucleus .",
    "interesting features include a liner spectrum and variable radio core ( fosbury 1978 ) , luminous h@xmath47o maser ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1994 ) and an absorbed x  ray emitting nuclear source ( weaver 1999 ) .",
    "although the outer stellar envelope appears to be relatively undisturbed ( it has a relatively low fine structure value of @xmath48 = 1.78 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) , it reveals multiple evidence for a past merger : + @xmath49 infalling hi gas .",
    "hi is seen in absorption redshifted on the nucleus indicating infalling hi gas ( van gorkom 1986 ) .",

    "extended hi mapping reveals two tidal tails , indicative of a gaseous merger about 1 gyr ago ( van gorkom 1986 ) .",
    "+ @xmath49 misaligned star / gas axis .",
    "the rotation axis of the hi gas ( pa = 134@xmath50 ) and ionized gas ( 125 - 131@xmath50 ) is misaligned with the stellar rotation axis ( 28@xmath50 ) .",
    "this indicates an external origin for the gas ( van gorkom 1986 ) .",
    "+ @xmath49 dust lanes .",
    "optical imaging ( forbes , sparks & macchetto 1990 ) indicates the presence of dust lanes near the galaxy centre . such a structure is unlikely to arise from _ in situ _ stellar mass loss .",
    "+ evidence for a past merger / accretion event seems overwhelming .",
    "however the time since the merger warrants further study .",
    "the hi tails would suggest a very recent merger ( i.e. @xmath0 1 gyr ) , whereas the lack of optical disturbance and a fundamental plane residual of + 0.07 ( prugniel & simien 1996 ) would suggest a long time has elapsed since the last major burst of star formation ( forbes , ponman & brown 1998 ) .",
    "a reliable spectroscopic age for the galaxy stars is not yet available . to be consistent with the time since the hi tails formed",
    ", the red gcs would need to have a metallicity of at least solar ( for [ fe / h ] @xmath51 0 , the implied age from figure [ n1052model ] is @xmath52 2.5 gyrs ) .",
    "if the red gcs were indeed this metal  rich and young , it would support arguments for their formation in the same merger event that formed the hi tails .",
    "however , gcs this young would also be expected to be brighter on average than the blue gcs , even if metal ",
    "rich ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "examination of figure 4 shows that this is not the case , i.e. the red gcs are about 0.5 mag _",
    "fainter _ on average than the blue ones . the current hi content , of a few 10@xmath53 m@xmath54 ( van gorkom 1986 )",
    ", suggests that the most recent merger will not produce significant numbers of gcs for typical gas - to - cluster formation efficiencies .",
    "so although a recent merger has occurred in ngc 1052 , that event seems very unlikely to be responsible for the population of red gcs .",
    "globular cluster formation in a very old merger , via multi  phase collapse or from accretion would appear more likely indicating that the red gcs are metal  poor , e.g. [ fe / h ] @xmath0 0.5 .",
    "the properties of ngc 1052 gc system appear to be unexceptional .",
    "we derive a specific frequency , s@xmath40 , of 3.2 .",
    "this is typical for ellipticals in groups ( harris 1991 ) . with s@xmath40 = 3.2 and a gc density profile slope of @xmath45 = 2.08 ,",
    "the galaxy lies is within the s@xmath40slope trend seen by forbes ( 1997 ) . like other galaxies ( geisler 1996",
    "; forbes 1998 ) the apparent radial gradient in gc mean colour appears to be due to the fact that the red ( metal  rich ) gcs are more centrally concentrated than the blue ( metal  poor ) ones .",
    "thus the intrinsic gradient is weak . in a collapse scenario",
    "this suggests that dissipation has not played a strong role .",
    "the galaxy starlight has a similar ( it is redder by about 0.25 mags ) colour than the red gcs , as is often seen in other galaxies ( e.g. forbes & forte 2000 ) .",
    "it suggests that the red gcs and the galaxy field stars may have formed at similar times from similar enriched gas .",
    "the red , and to a lesser extent the blue , gc systems appear to be aligned in position angle with the galaxy major axis .    in terms of gc formation models ,",
    "most of the gc system properties would be consistent with those expected from either an old merger ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) or the multi  phase collapse ( forbes 1997 ) .",
    "one feature that favours the multi  phase collapse idea is the tendency for the red gcs to be more closely aligned in position angle to the galaxy starlight than the blue gcs .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the red subpopulation forming during the ` galactic ' phase in which the bulk of the galaxy stars also form .",
    "this s0 galaxy reveals evidence for distortions in the outer isophotes .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) assigned it @xmath48 = 4.00 , indicating high optical disturbance .",
    "it also lies off the fundamental plane by 0.31 dex ( prugniel & simien 1996 ) suggesting a young age ( forbes 1998 ) .",
    "indeed spectroscopy of the galaxy centre indicates an age since the last major burst of star formation of 4.5 gyrs ( terlevich & forbes 2000 ) .",
    "studies of the ionized gas reveal evidence for two components , one of which is counter  rotating with respect to the stellar distribution ( plana & boulesteix 1996 ) .",
    "such evidence suggests that ngc 7332 is a good candidate for a recent merger event .",
    "if the red gcs formed in a merger event less than 5 gyrs ago , then a metallicity of at least solar is indicated by the worthey ( 1994 ) models ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "this would be consistent with the spectroscopic age of the galaxy , but we remind the reader of the tentative nature of the bimodal colour distribution .",
    "an old age for the red gcs ( expected under the accretion and multi  phase collapse models ) would require they be metal ",
    "poor , e.g. around half solar . assuming that the red subpopulation is indeed dominated by gcs",
    ", we can not currently discriminate between gc formation in a recent merger event or _ in situ _ associated with the bulge / disk of the galaxy .",
    "we derive a relatively shallow slope for the radial gc surface density of @xmath45 of 1.5 , and a low specific frequency s@xmath40 of 2.0 , however such values remain uncertain due to the possible high contamination rate .",
    "here we present multi  colour keck imaging of two nearby galaxies thought to have undergone a merger .",
    "after colour , magnitude and visual selection we detect 359 and 154 globular cluster candidates in ngc 1052 and ngc 7332 respectively .",
    "we derive globular cluster density profiles , global specific frequencies and in the case of ngc 1052 , globular cluster radial colour gradients and azimuthal distribution . in general",
    "these globular cluster properties are normal for early  type galaxies .",
    "both galaxies also reveal a bimodal globular cluster colour distribution indicating two globular cluster subpopulations ( although in the case of ngc 7332 the red subpopulation is heavily contaminated by background galaxies ) .",
    "the kmm test indicates roughly equal numbers in each subpopulation .",
    "the blue subpopulation has colours consistent with being very old ( age @xmath0 15 gyrs ) and metal  poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 1.5 ) .",
    "the mean colour difference in the two subpopulations is compared to stellar population models .",
    "although both galaxies have undergone a recent merger , we argue that this event has had little effect on the gc systems . if globular clusters formed in a multi  phase collapse or via accretion , the red ones are required to be metal ",
    "poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 0.5 ) .",
