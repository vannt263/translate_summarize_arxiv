    "<S> various novel transport phenomena in chiral systems result from the interplay of quantum anomalies with magnetic field and vorticity in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , and could survive the expansion of the fireball and be detected in experiments . among them are the chiral magnetic effect , the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic wave , the experimental searches for which have aroused extensive interest . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this review is to describe the current status of experimental studies at relativistic heavy ion collider at bnl and the large hadron collider at cern , and to outline the future work in experiment needed to eliminate the existing uncertainties in the interpretation of the data . </S>"
