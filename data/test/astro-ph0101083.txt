    "lepton asymmetry influences cn with oscillations in several ways : the neutrino and antineutrino ensembles evolve differently in comparison with the case without asymmetry , i.e neutrino number densities , their depletion and spectrum distortion are changed . also due to asymmetry term neutrino and antineutrino become strongly coupled and evolve differently .",
    "lepton asymmetry changes as well the oscillation pattern , i.e. leads to an enhancement or suppression of oscillations .",

    ", all these assumptions do not work .",
    "according to ( a)-(d ) : neutrino oscillations change the number of neutrino flavours ; they may produce nonequilibrium neutrino number densities ( particularly the electron neutrino density may be considerably reduced in favour of the sterile neutrino density ) ; the neutrino spectrum may be distorted in active - sterile oscillations ; besides , even if initially the lepton asymmetry is assumed zero resonant oscillations may lead to a considerable growth of the asymmetry , which on its turn effects neutrinos and nucleons evolution via oscillations .",

    "this allows to account precisely for the spectrum distortion effect and neutrino depletion effects of oscillations , as well as to follow the evolution of the neutrino asymmetry and its back effect at each neutrino momentum .    in our numerical analysis",
    "the spectrum distortion was described by 1000 bins for the nonresonant case and by 5000 bins for the resonant case . in case",

    "hence , having in mind this small value the registered asymmetry effect is totally due to its _ indirect _ influence on cn via oscillations .",
    "dynamically produced asymmetry at small mixing angles suppresses oscillations , which leads to less overproduction of @xmath2 in comparison with cn with oscillations but without an asymmetry account .",

    "it was found that the asymmetry is able also to _ enhance _ oscillations , besides its well known ability to suppress them .",
    "the enhancement is a synthetic effect of a resonant wave passing through neutrino spectrum till lepton asymmetry changes sign and followed by a similar ` spectrum ' resonance at the antineutrino ensemble and vice versa  @xcite .",
    "hence , this enhancement has a complex spectral character and could be revealed only by a precise kinetic approach to the oscillation problem .",
    "the influence of the asymmetry should not be reduced only to oscillations suppression , as usually believed . depending on the concrete values of oscillations parameters",

    "qualitatively , for oscillations affective after the freeze - out of the electron neutrino , the asymmetry effect is as follows : @xmath45 has negligible effect on cn ; @xmath46 enhances oscillations due to the spectrum wave resonance  @xcite , resulting into an enhanced overproduction of helium-4 ; @xmath47 leads to a suppression of oscillations and relaxation of the cn bounds ( fig .",

    "3 the isohelium contours @xmath38 are presented , for different @xmath43 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for small mixing angles",
    "the asymmetry @xmath48 enhances oscillations , which reflects into stronger bounds on oscillation parameters , while for large mixings this asymmetry suppresses oscillations and cn bounds are weakened compared with @xmath49 case .    a similar investigation , of initial asymmetry effect on cn with oscillations , for the resonant case will be a more complicated task due to technical problems : the usual explicit numerical approach is not applicable for the description of the asymmetry evolution , because the neutrino evolution equations at resonance have high stiffness ; besides the resonance case deserve much greater number of bins for the spectrum distortion description . to solve the stiff equations",
    "numerically , implicit methods should be used . for 5000 bins of the spectrum a system of 30000 equations describing the neutrino evolution",
    "should be solved simultaneously . however , this investigation is interesting , as far as such small values of the initial relic asymmetry are not excluded neither from observations nor from some profound theoretical principle .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to stress that small asymmetries , initially present or dynamically generated , influence cn thanks to their backfeed effect on oscillating neutrinos.the account of spectrum distortion of the oscillating neutrinos as well as the selfconsistent account of neutrinos and nucleons evolution is essential for revealing the indirect effect of small lepton asymmetries .",
    "therefore , a precise kinetic approach should be provided when analyzing the effect of lepton asymmetry on cn with oscillations .",
