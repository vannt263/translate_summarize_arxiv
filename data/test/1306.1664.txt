    "to study the plasma boundary sheath with algebraic models has a long tradition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to more complex models which require time - consuming computer simulations , algebraic sheath models execute effectively in zero time .",
    "this makes them suitable for many practical purposes , for example for the model based real - time control of plasma processes .",
    "of course , the validity of simplified descriptions is always an issue .",
    "algebraic sheath models should thus be carefully derived from first principles and thoroughly tested against more complex ( and more physical ) approaches such as _ particle in cell _",
    "( pic ) simulations .    in the present manuscript",
    "we propose a novel algebraic model for the electrical behavior of the rf modulated plasma boundary sheath .",
    "our investigation is motivated by a critical assessment of the pioneering ( and still `` classical '' ) algebraic sheath models which were proposed by lieberman twenty - five years ago @xcite . in many aspects ,",
    "our approach is similar : we focus on the rf regime , where the applied radio frequency lies between the plasma frequencies of ions and electrons , @xmath0 , consider only one species of singly charged positive ions without any `` chemistry '' , and assume a one - dimensional cartesian geometry.we endeavor , however , to correct the three fundamental weaknesses of the lieberman models , namely that they are limited to the case of a single driving frequency , to the regime of large applied voltages ( compared to the thermal voltage @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the electron temperature ) , and to the two limiting cases of either highly collisional or completely collision - free motion . in other words , our goal is an algebraic model which captures the plasma sheath behavior in a wide range of frequencies , waveforms , amplitudes , and collisionality .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe our starting point , the `` standard model '' of the rf modulated sheath . after reviewing the lieberman approach",
    ", we return to the standard model and employ the _ advanced algebraic approximation _ @xcite to transform it  practically without any loss of accuracy  into a mathematically simpler form .",
    "the outcome of this first step is a valid sheath model of its own , but not yet of a closed form .",
    "we thus take a second step , employing a sequence of additional , more drastic approximations .",
    "( a two - step approach is chosen because the intermediate model is better suited to assess the effects of the `` drastic appproximations '' than the original one . )",
    "the result of the second step is our novel algebraic model , which then will be thoroughly tested against pic simulations .",
    "some conclusions and final remarks are given in the last section .",
    "for the description of the sheath , we employ what may be called the `` standard model '' .",
    "it assumes the rf regime , i.e. , that the exciting radio frequency @xmath3 lies between the plasma frequencies of ions and electrons , @xmath0 , and also imposes the length scale ordering @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the debye length , @xmath6 the sheath thickness , @xmath7  the system length , and @xmath8 the ionization length scale .",

    "their equation of continuity can be integrated to express the constancy of the ion flux flowing in negative @xmath15-direction , @xmath16 the equation of motion describes the acceleration of ions under the action of the phase - averaged electrical field @xmath17 and the friction due to collisions with the neutral background.in sheath models , the latter term is typically modeled by the assumption of a constant ion mean free path @xmath18 which is valid for strong electrical fields .",
    "( a more general ansatz for the friction gives qualitatively similar results but with less transparent formulas ) .",
    "@xmath19 the field is described by poisson s equation , @xmath20    the model is mathematically completed by a set of boundary conditions and constraints .",
    "sheath - like solutions as shown in fig .",

    "( together , these assumptions remove all degrees of freedom of the ode system except one . )",
    "the rf modulation of the sheath is introduced by prescribing the total current density @xmath23 , which is divergence free and a spatial constant in 1d .",
    "we express it as the sum of a temporally constant part @xmath24 and a periodic , average free , not necessarily harmonic part @xmath25 , @xmath26 this relation can be cast in a more explicit form .",
    "we define the sheath charge per area @xmath27 as the integral of the charge density between the electrode @xmath28 and the bulk point @xmath11 , @xmath29 integrating poisson s equation from @xmath28 to @xmath11 yields a relation between @xmath27 and the electrical field at the electrode ; provided that the field at @xmath11 can be neglected : @xmath30 the electron current @xmath31 at the electrode can be found by the hertz - langmuir formula which expresses the flux as the product of the projected thermal speed and the local density @xcite.taking into account an effective sticking factor @xmath32 which may be , contrary to common belief , not equal to unity @xcite , we set : @xmath33 integrating the boltzmann relation from @xmath28 to @xmath11 , we can express the electron density at @xmath28 in terms of presumably constant density at @xmath11 and the sheath voltage @xmath34 : @xmath35 here , the sheath voltage is defined as the field integral from @xmath28 to @xmath11 , with the negative sign reflecting the fact that the field is oriented into the negative @xmath15-direction : @xmath36 together , these assumptions gives the current balance as follows , which is the justification for the popular diode model @xcite of the plasma boundary sheath ( fig .",
    "2 ) : the total current @xmath23is the sum of a capacitive part ( represented by a nonlinear capacitor ) , an exponential electron part ( represented by a diode ) and a constant part ( represented by a current source ) : @xmath37    taking the phase average of the current balance relation yields a representation of the dc current characteristics of the sheath : @xmath38 when the electrode is current - free or `` floating '' , the dc current density @xmath39 is equal to zero . to determine the corresponding sheath condition",
    ", one must solve @xmath40    in the fluctuating part of the current balance , we can neglect the ( in  comparison with the rf current ) typically small electron current @xmath41 and write @xmath42 it is advantageous to split @xmath43 into an average @xmath44 and a fluctuating , average - free part @xmath45 .",
    "the average sheath charge defines the mean sheath thickness @xmath46 via @xmath47 for the fluctuating sheath charge , we get the explicite representation @xmath48 we take the view that the fluctuating charge @xmath45 is the control parameter of the modulation and define @xmath49 and @xmath50 as its minimum and maximum values within the phase cycle @xmath12 $ ] . for vanishing modulation , both are zero , otherwise @xmath49 is negative and @xmath50 is positive .",
    "their absolute values are different unless @xmath45 is symmetric .",
    "as additional characterization we introduce the effective modulation amplitude @xmath51",
    "it is advantageous to write the model dimensionless .",
    "however , some care must be taken , as an unfortunate choice of units may obscure the scaling relations .",
    "we take as basis the voltage scale @xmath52 of the sheath ; for weak modulation it is several @xmath1 , for strong modulation it is equal to the applied voltage .",
    "the other units are calculated using collisionless relations .",
    "altogether , we make the following substitutions , with the prime ( which is dropped soon)denoting dimensionless quantities : @xmath53 we also introduce dimensionless numbers ( and their typical values ) .",
    "the ratio of the length scale to the ion mean free path , with @xmath54 absorbed , is the collisionality @xmath55 , @xmath56 the ratio of the electron voltage to the voltage scale is the thermal parameter @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the combination of the electron sticking factor @xmath32 and the square root of the mass ratio , with @xmath59 absorbed , is the effective sticking parameter @xmath60 , @xmath61 another parameter , the ratio of the rf current to the dc current , does not appear explicitly , but it should be noted that it is typically large ( except for non - modulated sheaths ) : @xmath62    the dimensionless equations then consist of several subgroups : the stationary ion model involves the phase - averaged field @xmath17 , @xmath63 the electron model consists of boltzmann s equilibrium and poisson s equation , @xmath64 it is parametrical modulated by the condition that the fluctuating sheath charge follows a given time function @xmath45 which is related to the fluctuating rf current @xmath65 , @xmath66 the position of the electrode @xmath28 relative to the solution is determined by chosing a particular point of the dc ( phase - averaged ) current voltage curve @xmath67 where the sheath voltage is calculated as @xmath68 for the particularly important case of a floating electrode or wall , the current relation reduces to the condition for a current - free sheath , @xmath69 once the electrode position is known , also the average sheath charge can be calculated : @xmath70    the problem posed by the listed equations is quite intricate .",
    "the two subsystems alone are nonlinear differential equations , but they are coupled by the operation of phase averaging.altogether , the sheath problem thus amounts to a system of nonlinear integro - differential equations for which no analytical solutions are known . of course , numerical solutions of the system can be easily constructed , but this misses the point of an analytical treatment . clearly , a `` short - cut '' is needed which allows to construct explicit expressions for the phase - averaged quantities @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "( see fig .  [ shortcut ] ) .",
    "in his pioneering work , lieberman proposed such a shortcut @xcite .",
    "his approach consisted of three approximations and specializations : first , he imposed godyak s step model @xcite .",
    "this approximation rests on the fact that the thermal electron voltage @xmath1 is small compared to the applied sheath voltage @xmath34 ; i.e. , in our notation , that the thermal parameter @xmath57 is small . it replaces the boltzmann relation for the electrons by the assumption that the density of the electrons is zero below the electron edge @xmath73 and equal to the ion density above : @xmath74 the value of @xmath73 is related to the sheath charge @xmath27 ; @xmath75 substituted into poisson s equation , the step model allows to calculate the electrical field , where the integration constant is chosen so that the field vanishes at the step : @xmath76 lieberman s second simplification was that he did not study the full range of collisionality but only the limiting cases of completely collisional and completely collisionless dynamics.in our notation , they are given by the ion equations of motion or instead of .both assumption enable the explicit evaluation of the ion model by establishing an algebraic relation between the ion speed and either the averaged potential @xmath77 ( in the collisionless case)or the averaged electrical field @xmath71 ( in the collisional case ) : @xmath78 and , finally , focussed on the case of a single harmonic excitation , @xmath79    lieberman s models were quite successful , and , to this date , they represent the standard for any algebraic sheath model .",
    "they have , however , shortcomings which directly arise from the assumptions mentioned above :    * the restriction on single - frequency excitation is limiting . for technological reasons ,",
    "double and triple frequency plasmas have become frequently employed in the last years .",
    "moreover , it is now known that even harmonically excited discharges may exhibit very unharmonics rf currents @xcite . *",
    "equally limiting is the concentration on the cases of purely collisional and purely collisionless ion motion .",
    "many technical plasmas are operated in the transition regime , where the mean free path and the sheath thickness are comparable @xcite . *",
    "the adoption of the godyak step model implies that all `` thermal effects '' are neglected .",
    "this is especially serious when the excitation amplitude is small ; in particular the phenomena of a finite sheath thickness and a non - vanishing `` floating potential '' at zero modulation amplitude can not be captured @xcite .",
    "these deficiencies are of very different nature .",
    "the assumption of a sinusoidal excitation is merely a matter of convenience .",
    "the generalization to more complex current wave forms is easily possible ( if cumbersome ) ; several models which cover this point were published @xcite .",
    "the restriction to the limit cases of collisionality is more severe ; the derivations of lieberman require explicite relations which express the ion density either in terms of the potential ( collisionless case ) or in terms of the field strength ( collisional case ) .",
    "a direct generalization of the derivations to the transitional regime is not possible .",
    "however , the most critical assumption is that of the step model .",
    "three recent publications have analyzed the situation in detail @xcite .",
    "it was found that expression performs well in the electron depletion region but badly in the transition zone and the quasineutral zone where it misses the ambipolar field .",
    "this deficit causes a divergence of the ion density density at the sheath edge but is of minor importance for the value of the sheath voltage . the error caused by",
    ", however , is more critical : it can not capture the residual electron population in the depletion region which is needed to evaluate the conditions or @xmath80 .",
    "lieberman was thus forced to identify the electrode position @xmath28 with the minumum value of the electron step @xmath81 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite found that the sheath voltage error caused by this uncertainty of the sheath shickness can be substantial .",
    "publications @xcite did not only analyze the problems caused by the godyak step model but proposed also a cure . based on a better approximate  for all practical purposes : exact solution of the boltzmann - poisson problem and , the so - called _ advanced algebraic approximation _",
    "( aaa ) was constructed .",
    "it is expressed in a new system of _ charge coordinates _ , where the integration limit @xmath46 was defined in :",
    "@xmath82 the approximation consists of expressions for the electrical field and the electron density , all expressed in terms of the difference of @xmath83 to the sheath charge @xmath84 , and the local values of the ion density and its derivative .",
    "( the dependence on the dimensionless numbers @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath60 is suppressed in the notation . ) the special functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 which appear in and are defined in terms of certain differential equations ; they are smooth and in fact analytical .",
    "we call them `` switch functions '' ; they switch the behavior of the field and density expressions from electron depletion to quasineutrality ( see figs .  [ xiplot ] and [ sigmaplot ] ) .",
    "finite values of @xmath57 lead to a thermal `` softening '' of the transition ; the limit @xmath87 recovers the step model : @xmath88 the aaa allows also an easy calculation of the phase - averages of the field and the density .",

    "its most important feature is its inner singularity at a point @xmath97 where the lhs and the rhs simultaneously vanish .",
    "this singularity  which was identified as a `` collisionally modified bohm point ''  acts as an inner boundary condition and fixes the remaining degree of freedom of the sheath equation.the resulting ion density @xmath98 is a function of @xmath83 and a functional of the curve @xmath99 .",
    "subsequently , the electrode position can be found from the dc current - voltage curve ; @xmath100 under floating conditions one has to solve : @xmath101 the average sheath charge is the negative of that value , @xmath102 finally , the electrical potential across the sheath is calculated as @xmath103 as the last step , one can construct transformation back into physical coordinates , @xmath104",
    "for all practical purposes , the formulas given in the last chapter amount to an exact solution of the `` standard sheath model '' .",
    "numerical studies confirmed that the deviation from the exact solution is in the percentage range ( densities ) or below ( sheath voltage ) @xcite .",
    "however , the model is not yet algebraic , one must still solve the differential equation . in this section",
    ", we will employ further approximations to achieve an algebraic form .",
    "we start by recalling that the presence of the ambipolar field in enables the solution to cross the critical point and enter the bulk regime . neglecting this contribution",
    "confines the model solely to the sheath , but the resulting error in the sheath voltage is only of order @xmath57.we may safely neglect also other thermal effects in the representation of the sheath field .",
    "the resulting model is exactly the step approximation : @xmath105 the phase average of @xmath106 yields the step function version of the switch function @xmath107 , @xmath108 the sheath differential equation now assumes a much simpler form .",
    "it is advantageous to express it in terms of the ion velocity , and to set  as the now necessary boundary condition  the ion velocity at @xmath50 equal to the collisionally modified bohm velocity @xcite : @xmath109 the step function approximation can also be used for the sheath voltage , leading to @xmath110 unfortunately , a similar approximation for the current conditions or is not feasible .",
    "simply neglecting thermal effects  taking @xmath87  would render the conditions meaningless ; any approximate evaluation would be instable due to the exponential nature of the relations .",

    "displayed above , the ion velocity @xmath112 or density @xmath93 are still given in terms of the solution of a nonlinear differential equation .",
    "we first focus on the two limiting cases .",
    "the collision - free limit equation is as follows , with the boundary condition now derived from the conventional bohm condition @xmath113 we define the function @xmath114 as the negative integral of @xmath115 , @xmath116 and get thus the algebraic solution @xmath117 the collisional limit is also algebraic and can be solved directly , @xmath118 the general case of the ion model does not have a similarly simple algebraic solution but its physical content is transparent : the electrical force is balanced by inertia and friction , and thus dominated by whatever is larger .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that it is reasonable to employ the approximation of a quadratic harmonic mean , @xmath119    together , the described equations constitute an algebraic (= `` closed form '' ) model to calculate the time - resolved sheath voltage @xmath34 . however , it is not yet very convenient to use , owing to the presence of the functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 which depend not only on the variable @xmath83 but also functionally on the modulation @xmath99 .",

    "<S> the boundary sheath of a low temperature plasma comprises typically only a small fraction of its volume but is responsible for many aspects of the macroscopic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough understanding of the sheath dynamics is therefore of theoretical and practical importance . </S>",
    "<S> this work focusses on the so - called `` algebraic '' approach which strives to describe the electrical behavior of rf modulated boundary sheaths in closed analytical form , i.e. , without the need to solve differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> a mathematically simple , analytical expression for the charge - voltage relation of a sheath is presented which holds for all excitation wave forms and amplitudes and covers all regimes from the collision - less motion at low gas pressure to the collision dominated motion at gas high pressure . a comparison with the results of self - consistent particle - in - cell simulations is also presented . </S>"
