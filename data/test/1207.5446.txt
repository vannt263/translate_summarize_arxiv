    "_ public key cryptography _ is based on asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that use two related keys , a _",
    "public key _ and a _ private key _ ; the two keys have the property that , given the public key , it is computationally infeasible to derive the private key .",
    "a user publishes his / her public key in a public directory such as an ldap directory and keeps his / her private key to himself / herself .",
    "according to the purpose of the algorithm , there are public - key encryption / decryption algorithms and signature algorithms .",
    "an encryption algorithm could be used to encrypt a data ( for example , a symmetric key ) using the public key so that only the recipient who has the corresponding private key could decrypt the data .",
    "typical public key encryption algorithms are rsa and ecies ( elliptic curve integrated encryption scheme , see , secg 2000 ) . a signature algorithm together with a message digest algorithm could be used to transform a message of any length using the private key to a _ signature _ in such a way that , without the knowledge of the private key , it is computationally infeasible to find two messages with the same signature , to find a message for a pre - determined signature , or to find a signature for a given message .",
    "anyone who has the corresponding public key could verify the validity of the signature .",
    "typical public key digital signature algorithms are rsa , dsa , and ecdsa .    there have been extensive standardization efforts for public key cryptographic techniques .",
    "the major standards organizations that have been involved in public key cryptographic techniques are :    * iso / iec . the international organization for standardization ( iso ) and the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) ( individually and jointly )",
    "have been developing a series of standards for application - independent cryptographic techniques .",
    "iso has also been developing bank security standards under the iso technical committee tc86banking and related financial services . *",
    "the american national standards institute ( ansi ) have been developing public key cryptographic technique standards for financial services under accredited standards committee ( asc ) x9 .",
    "for example , they have developed the standards ansi x9.42 ( key management using diffie - hellman ) , ansi x9.44 ( key establishment using factoring - based public key cryptography ) , and ansi x9.63 ( key agreement and key management using ecc ) .",
    "the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has been developing public key cryptography standards for use by us federal government departments .",
    "these standards are released in federal information processing standards ( fips ) publications . *",
    "the internet engineering task force has been developing public key cryptography standards for use by the internet community .",
    "these standards are published in requests for comments ( rfcs ) . *",
    "the ieee 1363 working group has been publishing standards for public key cryptography , including ieee 1363 - 2000 , ieee 1363a , ieee p1363.1 , and ieee p1363.2 . * vendor - specific standards .",
    "this category includes pkcs standards that we will describe , sec standards , and others .",
    "standards for efficient cryptography ( sec ) # 1 and # 2 are elliptic curve public key cryptography standards that have been developed by certicom corp .  in cooperation with secure systems developers world - wide .",
    "the pkcs standards , developed by rsa laboratories ( a division of rsa data security inc . ) in cooperation with secure systems developers worldwide for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of public - key cryptography , are widely implemented in practice , and periodically updated .",
    "contributions from the pkcs standards have become part of many formal and de facto standards , including ansi x9 documents , ietf documents , and ssl / tls ( secure socket layer / transport layer security ) .",
    "the parts and status of pkcs standards are listed in table [ pkcstable ] and are discussed in details in the following sections .",
    "the descriptions are largely adapted from the pkcs documents themselves . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we give an example application which uses all these pkcs standards .",
    ".pkcs specifications [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     pkcs # 15 compliant ic cards should support direct application selection as defined in iso / iec 7816 - 4 section 9 and iso - iec 7816 - 5 section 6 ( the full aid is to be used as parameter for a `` select file '' command ) .",
    "the operating system of the card must keep track of the currently selected application and only allow the commands applicable to that particular application while it is selected . the application identifier ( aid )",
    "data element consists 12 bytes and its contents is defined in pkcs # 15 .",
    "objects could be created , modified , and removed from the object directory file on a card .",
    "asn.1 syntax for these objects have also been specified in pkcs # 15 .",
    "we conclude this chapter with an example application of different pkcs standards .",
    "assume that we want to implement a smart card authentication system based on public key cryptography technology .",
    "each user will be issued a smart card containing user s private key , public key certificate , and other personal information .",
    "users can authenticate themselves to different computing systems ( or banking systems ) by inserting their smart cards into card readers attached to these computing systems and typing the password ( or pin ) .",
    "rsa cryptographic primitives specified in pkcs # 1 could be chosen as the underlying cryptographic mechanisms .",
    "first , user alice needs to register herself to the system to get her smart card . in the registration process , the system first generates a public - key / private - key pair for alice . using pkcs # 9 ,",
    "the system may create a naturalperson object or a few attributes containing alice s personal information .",
    "these information can then be used to generate a certificaterequest object according to pkcs#10 .",
    "the system can then send the certificaterequest object to the certificate authorities ( ca ) enveloped using cms ( pkcs # 7 ) .",
    "after the identity information verification , the ca signs alice s public key to generate a certificate for alice and sends it back to the system . after receiving alice s certificate from the ca , the system can now build a smart card for alice . using alice s password ( pin )",
    ", the system generates an encryptedprivatekeyinfo object for alice according to pkcs # 8 and pkcs # 9 ( pkcs # 5 is also used in this procedure ) .",
    "pkcs # 12 may then be used to transfer alice s encrypted private key and personal information from one computer to another computer ( e.g. , from a server machine to the smart card making machine ) . using the dedicated file format df(pkcs#15 )",
    ", alice s encrypted private key object encryptedprivatekeyinfo , certificate , and other personal information could be stored on the smart card .",
    "the card is now ready for alice to use ! at the same time , alice may also get a copy of these private information on a usb memory stick . these personal information is stored on the memory stick according to pkcs # 12 .",
    "since all computing systems ( e.g. , different platforms from different vendors ) support pkcs # 11 api , when alice insert her card into an attached card reader , applications on these computing systems can communicate smoothly with alice s smart card .",
    "in particular , after typing password ( pin ) , alice s smart card can digitally sign challenges from these computing systems and these computing systems can verify alice s signature using the certificate presented by alice s smart card .",
    "thus alice can authenticate herself to these systems .",
