    "the casimir force @xcite between uncharged metallic plates attracts considerable attention as a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum vacuum @xcite . with the development of microtechnologies , which routinely control the separation between bodies smaller than 1 @xmath0 ,",
    "the force became a subject of systematic experimental investigation .",
    "modern precision experiments have been performed using different techniques such as torsion pendulum @xcite , atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite and different geometrical configurations : sphere - plate @xcite , plate - plate @xcite and crossed cylinders @xcite .",
    "the relative experimental precision of the most precise of these experiments is estimated to be about 0.5% for the recent mems measurement @xcite and 1% for the afm experiments",
    "@xcite .    in order to come to a valuable comparison between the experiments and the theoretical predictions , one has to calculate the force with a precision comparable to the experimental accuracy .",
    "this is a real challenge to the theory because the force is material , surface , geometry and temperature dependent . here",
    "we will only focus on the material dependence , which is easy to treat on a level of some percent precision but which will turn out difficult to tackle on a high level of precision since different uncontrolled factors are involved .    in its original form , the casimir force per unit surface @xcite    @xmath1    was calculated between ideal metals .",
    "it depends only on the fundamental constants and the distance between the plates @xmath2 .",
    "the force between real materials differs significantly from  ( [ fc ] ) for mirror separations smaller than 1  @xmath3 m .    for mirrors of arbitrary material , which can be described by reflection coefficients",
    ", the force per unit area can be written as @xcite :    @xmath4 ^ 2 e^{-2\\kappa l}}{1-r_{\\mu } \\left [ i\\zeta , \\mathbf{k } \\right]^2 e^{-2\\kappa l}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\kappa=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{k}^{2}+ \\frac{\\zeta ^{2}}{c^2 } } \\label{force}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 denotes the reflection amplitude for a given polarization @xmath6",
    "@xmath7    the force between dielectric materials had first been derived by lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "the material properties enter these formulas via the dielectric function @xmath8 at angular imaginary frequencies @xmath9 , which is related to the physical quantity @xmath10 with the help of the dispersion relation    @xmath11    for metals @xmath12 is large at low frequencies , thus the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ k - k ] ) comes from the low frequencies even if @xmath13 corresponds to the visible frequency range . for this reason the low - frequency behavior of @xmath14 is of primary importance .",
    "the casimir force is often calculated using the optical data taken from @xcite , which provides real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function within some frequency range , typically between 0.1 and @xmath15  ev for the most commonly used metals , au , cu and al , corresponding to a frequency interval @xmath16 $ ]  rad / s ( 1  ev=@xmath17  rad / s  rad / s was used , leading however to a negligible difference in the casimir force ( well below 1% ) . ] ) .",
    "when the two plates are separated by a distance @xmath2 , one may introduce a characteristic imaginary frequency @xmath18 of electromagnetic field fluctuations in the gap .",
    "fluctuations of frequency @xmath19 give the dominant contribution to the casimir force .",
    "for example , for a plate separation of @xmath20  nm the characteristic imaginary frequency is @xmath21  ev . comparison with the frequency interval where optical data is available shows that the high frequency data exceeds the characteristic frequency by 3 orders of magnitude , which is sufficient for the calculation of the casimir force .",
    "however , in the low frequency domain , optical data exists only down to frequencies which are one order of magnitude below the characteristic frequency , which is not sufficient to evaluate the casimir force .",
    "therefore for frequencies lower than the lowest tabulated frequency , @xmath22 , the data has to be extrapolated .",
    "this is typically done by a drude dielectric function    @xmath23    which is determined by two parameters , the plasma frequency @xmath24 and the relaxation frequency @xmath25 .",
    "different procedures to get the drude parameters have been discussed in the literature .",
    "they may be estimated , for example , from information in solid state physics or extracted form the optical data at the lowest accessible frequencies .",
    "the exact values of the drude parameters are very important for the precise evaluation of the force .",
    "lambrecht and reynaud @xcite fixed the plasma frequency using the relation    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the number of conduction electrons per unit volume , @xmath28 is the charge and @xmath29 is the effective mass of electron .",
    "the plasma frequency was evaluated using the bulk density of au , assuming that each atom gives one conduction electron and that the effective mass coincides with the mass of the free electron .",
    "the optical data at the lowest frequencies were then used to estimate @xmath30 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) . in this way",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath31  ev and the relaxation frequency @xmath32  ev have been found .",
    "this procedure was largely adopted in the following @xcite . however , on the example of cu , it was stressed in @xcite that the optical data may vary from one reference to another and a different choice of parameters for the extrapolation procedure to low frequencies can influence the casimir force significantly .",
    "bostrm and sernelius @xcite and svetovoy and lokhanin @xcite extracted the low - frequency optical data by fitting them with eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) . for one set of data from ref .",
    "@xcite the result @xcite was close to that found by the first approach , but using different sources for the optical data collected in ref .",
    "@xcite an appreciable difference was found @xcite . this difference was attributed to the defects in the metallic films which appear as the result of the deposition process .",
    "it was indicated that the density of the deposited films is typically smaller and the resistivity larger than the corresponding values for the bulk material .",
    "the dependence of optical properties of au films on the details of the deposition process , annealing , voids in the films , and grain size was already discussed in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the optical data for au from several available sources , where the mid - infrared frequency range was investigated .",
    "the purpose is to establish the variation range of the drude parameters and calculate the uncertainty of the casimir force due to the variation of existing optical data .",
    "this uncertainty is of great importance in view of the recent precise casimir force measurement @xcite which have been performed with high experimental accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "sophisticated theoretical calculations predict the casimir force at the level of 1% or better .",
    "these results illustrate the considerable progress achieved in the field in only one decade . in order to assure a comparison between theory and experiment at the same level of precision",
    ", one has to make sure that the theoretical calculation considers precisely the same system investigated in the experiment .",
    "this is the key point we want to address in our paper . with our current investigation",
    "we find an intrinsic force uncertainty of the order of 5% coming from the fact that the drude parameters are not precisely known .",

    "annealing of the samples was not reported .",

    "the samples were semitransparent au films with a thickness of @xmath69    evaporated in ultrahigh vacuum on supersmooth fused silica .",
    "the substrate was kept in most cases at room temperature .",
    "after the deposition the films were annealed in the same vacuum at @xmath70  c. the structure of the films was investigated by x - ray and transmission - electron - microscopy methods .",
    "the dc resistivity of the films was found to be very sensitive to the preparation conditions .",

    "the values of @xmath14 were found for the electropolished bulk au(110 ) sample . originally the reflectance was measured in a broad interval @xmath74  ev and then the dielectric function was determined by a kramers - kronig analysis . due to indirect determination of @xmath75 the recommended accuracy of these data sets is only 10% .",
    "the optical data of motulevich and shubin @xcite for au films is marked with circles in fig .",
    "2 . in this paper",
    "the films were carefully described .",
    "gold was evaporated on polished glass at a pressure of @xmath76  torr .",

    "the observed deviation is the result of different preparation procedures and reflects genuine difference between samples .",
    "the deposition method , type of the substrate , its temperature , quality and the deposition rate influence the optical properties .",
    "when we are speaking about a precise comparison between theory and experiment for the casimir force at the level of 1% or better , there is no such material as gold in general any more .",
    "there is only a gold sample prepared under definite conditions .",
    "we will now use the available data in the mid - infrared region to extrapolate into the low frequency range .",
    "if the transition between inter- and intraband absorption in gold is sharp , the data below @xmath37 should be well described by the drude function    @xmath83    for @xmath84 , the data on the log - log plot should fit straight lines with the slopes @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , shifted along the ordinate due to variation of the parameters for different samples .",
    "the data points in the right graph of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are in general agreement with these expectations .",
    "the onset values for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , vary more significantly due to a significant change in @xmath90 for different samples , but the casimir force is in general not very sensitive to the relaxation parameter @xcite .",
    "the onset values for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , vary less but this variation is more important for the caimir force , which is particularly sensitive to the value of the plasma frequency @xmath93 .",
    "the drude parameters can be found by fitting both @xmath87 and @xmath94 with the functions ( [ imdrude ] ) . this procedure is discussed below .",
    "the dielectric function for low frequencies , @xmath95 , is found by the extrapolation of the optical data from the mid - infrared domain , @xmath96 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath75 follow from eq .",
    "( [ imdrude ] ) with an additional polarization term @xmath97 in @xmath98 :    @xmath99    the polarization term appears here due to the following reason . the total dielectric function @xmath100 includes contributions due to conduction electrons @xmath101 and the interband transitions @xmath102 .",
    "the polarization term consists of the atomic polarizability and polarization due to the interband transitions @xmath103",
    "@xmath104    where @xmath105 is the atomic polarizability and @xmath106 the concentration of atoms .",
    "if the transition from intra- to interband absorption is sharp , the polarization can be considered as constant , because the interband transitions have a threshold behavior with an onset frequency @xmath37 and the kramers - kronig relation allows one to express @xmath107 as    @xmath108    for @xmath109 this integral does not depend on @xmath110 , leading to a constant @xmath111 . in reality",
    "the situation is more complicated because the transition is not sharp and many factors can influence the transition region .",
    "we will assume here that @xmath97 is a constant but the fitting procedure will be shifted to frequencies where the transition tail is not very important . in practice",

    "the error is statistical .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first four rows of the table present the reduction factors for four pairs of the drude parameters that were obtained by fitting the optical data from different sources .",

    "the last two rows show the variation of the reduction factor if the plasma frequency @xmath93 or the relaxation parameter @xmath90 are varied by @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the upper ( lower ) line corresponds here to the upper ( lower ) sign .",
    "the variation of the optical data and the associated drude parameters introduces a variation in the casimir force ranging from 5.5% at short distances ( 100  nm ) to 1.5% at long distances ( 3  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the distance dependence is of course related to the fact that the material properties influence the casimir force much more at short than at long plate separation .",
    "the strongest variation of 5.5% gives an indication of the genuine sample dependence of the casimir force .",
    "for this reason it is necessary to measure the optical properties of the plates used in the casimir force measurement if a precision of the order 1% or better in the _ comparison _ between experimental values and theoretical predictions is aimed at .",
    "incidentally let us notice that the plasma frequency @xmath120  ev , which is found here to fit best palik s handbook data @xcite , is basically the same as the one proposed alternatively in @xcite for cu , which has very similar optical properties to au concerning the casimir force @xcite . for cu , the variation of the plasma frequency from @xmath116  ev to @xmath121",
    "ev introduced a variation of the casimir force up to 5% @xcite .    in order to asses more quantitatively the role of the two drude parameters , we show in the last two rows of table [ tab3 ] the variation of the reduction factor when either the plasma frequency or the relaxation parameter is varied with the other parameter kept constant .",
    "one can see that the increase ( decrease ) of the relaxation parameter by @xmath122 lowers ( increases ) the reduction factor @xmath123 at @xmath124 by only @xmath125 .",
    "however , the @xmath126 variation of the plasma frequency leads to @xmath127 change in the reduction factor .",
    "thus the casimir force is much more sensitive to the variation of the plasma frequency , basically as the plasma frequency determines the reflection quality of the plates ( an infinite plasma frequency corresponds to perfectly reflecting mirrors ) .",
    "in this paper we have performed the first systematic and detailed analysis of optical data for casmir force measurements .",
    "we have studied the relative importance of the different frequency regions for the casimir force as a function of the plate separation and established the critical role of the drude parameters in particular for short distance measurements .",
    "we have then analyzed and compared four different sets of optical data .",
    "for each set we have extracted the corresponding plasma frequency and relaxation parameter either by fitting real and imaginary part of the dielectric function at low frequencies or by using a detailed kramers - kronig analysis . both methods",
    "lead essentially to the same results .",
    "the kramers - kronig analysis reveals itself to be a powerful tool for the estimation of the low frequency drude parameters for data coming from the same sample .",
    "a variation of the values of the casimir force up to 5.5% is found for different optical data sets .",
    "this gives an intrinsic unknown parameter for the casimir force calculations and demonstrates the genuine sample dependence of the casimir force .",
    "the today existing numerical and analytical calculations of the casimir force in themselves are very precise . in the same way ,",
    "measurements of the casimir force have achieved high accuracy over the last decade . in order to compare the results of the achievements in theory and experiment at a level of 1% precision or better ,",
    "the crucial point is to make sure that calculations and experiments are performed for the same physical sample .",
    "one therefore has to know the optical and material properties of the sample used in the experiment .",
    "these properties must be measured for frequencies as low as possible . in practice ,",
    "the material properties have to be known over an interval of about 4 orders of magnitude around the characteristic frequency @xmath18 . for a plate separation of @xmath20  nm",
    "this means an interval [ 10  mev , 100  ev ] .",
    "if measurements at low frequencies are not possible , the low frequency drude parameters should be extracted from the measured data , by one of the two methods discussed here .",
