    "it is observationally well established that the velocity dispersion of main sequence stars increases with advancing spectral type .",
    "this fact has been recognised ever since velocity dispersions were first measured in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. king 1990 ) .",
    "initially these observations were explained as the result of equipartition of energy because the mass of the stars decreases along the main sequence .",
    "however the two - body relaxation time scale is much too long to have any effect on the stellar velocity ellipsoid , prompting explanations relying on collective effects instead .",
    "some of the different functional forms that have been suggested for the velocity dispersion - age relation are reviewed by lacey ( 1991 ) .",
    "this increase in velocity dispersion , or heating , depends on the roughness of the gravitational potential in the disk , so knowledge about the shape of the velocity ellipsoid will tell us a great deal about the dynamical history of a disk .    until recently direct measurements of the three - dimensional shape of the velocity ellipsoid have been restricted to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "observations of the stellar velocities in external spiral galaxies have concentrated on systems that are either close to edge - on or face - on ( van der kruit and freeman 1986 ; bottema 1995 ) and will therefore only provide information about a single component of the velocity dispersion . from these measurements",
    "only indirect inferences can be drawn about the shape of velocity ellipsoids in galaxies because the results of a small sample of _ different _ galaxies are being compared in a statistical way . moreover",
    ", this shape will be subject to rather large uncertainties because the errors of the face - on and edge - on galaxies are compounded , and because relating face - on and edge - on galaxies is rather delicate .    in this pilot study",
    "we show that it is possible to derive the shape of the velocity ellipsoid within a _ single _ galaxy .",
    "we use the fact that an intermediate - inclination galaxy shows different projections of the velocity dispersion at different galactocentric azimuths . in section 2",
    "the method by which we extract the velocity dispersions information is described . in section 3",
    "we apply this analysis to the large early type spiral ngc 488 and in section 4 we discuss the results obtained for ngc 488 and compare them to the velocity ellipsoid in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath0 the line - of - sight velocity dispersion as a function of ( intrinsic ) position angle @xmath1 in a thin axisymmetric disk is    @xmath2 \\sin^2 i + \\sigma_z^2",
    "\\cos^2 i , \\ ] ]    which can be written as    @xmath3.\\ ] ]    thus , it consists of an element with a @xmath4 variation that depends only on the components of the dispersion in the plane of the galaxy , and an element with no dependence on @xmath1 that depends on all three components of the velocity dispersion . observations along at least two axes ( preferably the major and minor axes , which provide maximum leverage ) , are therefore required to extract both coefficients .",
    "furthermore , in disk galaxies , in which most orbits are well - described by the epicycle approximation the radial and azimuthal dispersions obey the relation    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the circular speed in the galaxy .",
    "( in the solar neighbourhood , this expression reduces to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the oort constants . ) within the epicycle approximation the stellar rotation speed @xmath10 equals the circular speed @xmath11 , so the righthandside of eq .",
    "[ eq : ax ] can be derived from the same spectral observations that are used to measure the velocity dispersions .",
    "the effect of higher - order approximations on this formula are discussed by kuijken & tremaine 1991 , who showed that the strongest deviations from eq .",
    "[ eq : ax ] are to be found at radii of several disk scale lengths ( see also cuddeford & binney 1994 ) .    where the circular speed @xmath6 can be measured separately ( e.g. , from an emission - line rotation curve ) , a further constraint on the dispersions and velocities is the asymmetric drift equation , @xmath12 -r\\frac{\\partial \\sigma^2_{r z}}{\\partial z}\\ ] ]    the last term of equation 4 describes the tilting of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the two limiting cases of this tilting term are zero and ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "orbit integration by binney & spergel ( 1983 ) and by kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) suggest that in the solar neighbourhood the truth lies close to midway between the two extremes . as will be seen below",
    ", the uncertainty in this term is not a concern in the present analysis .    in summary",
    ", the three components of the stellar velocity ellipsoid can be deduced from measurements of the line - of - sight dispersions along two position angles in a galaxy disk .",
    "the two sets of measurements , together with the ratio of tangential and radial velocity dispersions appropriate for nearly circular orbits , provide the three equations necessary to deproject the ellipsoid .",
    "if the asymmetric drift can also be measured , e.g. when a rotation curve for cold interstellar gas is available , the system is overdetermined , allowing a consistency check on the result .",
    "we choose the large early type spiral ngc 488 for this analysis because of its regular optical appearance and its intermediate inclination .",
    "table 1 lists some properties of this galaxy .",
    "note the very high rotational velocity ( peterson 1980 ) .",
    ".parameters of ngc 488 [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     we have tested this procedure on a large ( @xmath14 ) set of artificial major and minor axis spectra , created from the template star to resemble the observed galactic spectra as closely as possible , with a different poisson noise realisation for each spectrum .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained from these spectra scatter with the same dispersion as the errors obtained from any individual fit to a spectrum .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the parameters returned by the fit programme are reliable .",
    "an obvious extension to our fitting procedure would be to use different scale lengths for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 dispersion components .",
    "unfortunately the data are not of sufficient quality to allow for a six parameter fit .",
    "one of the six eigenvalues that we obtained from diagonalising the correlation matrix was much larger than the other five , a clear indication that a six parameter fit is stretching the data a bit too much .",
    "interestingly , the kinematic scale length of the disk appears to be comparable to the photometric one .",
    "this is not the expectation from local isothermal approximation for disks , which predicts a scale length double the photometric one .",
    "the most likely explanation is probably the fact that we measure the scale length in the b band while the stellar mass distribution is best traced in the k band , the near infra - red .",
    "empirically it is found that scale lengths in the k band are shorter than the b band up to a factor of about  2 ( de jong 1995 , figure 4 and peletier et al .",
    "1996 ) . alternatively",
    "the approximation of a local isothermal distribution breaks down .",
    "the fits described above are to the stellar data only .",
    "the lowest panel in fig .",
    "2 shows the emission line data of peterson and the predictions from our two fits .",
    "both our fits are fully consistent with these data , and provide extra confirmation of the validity of our analysis .",
    "( a simple power - law fit to the emission - line data plotted in fig .",
    "2 gives a power index of 0.18 @xmath17 0.13 . )",
    "unfortunately there are no measured emission line velocities in the inner part of the disk .",
    "peterson gives velocities around 195 km / s near a radius of 10 arcsec which are a little higher than our fits would predict .",
    "however there is no reason why a power - law rotation curve should persist into those central , bulge dominated regions .",
    "this is the first direct measurement of the vertical - to - radial velocity dispersion ratio anywhere outside the solar neighbourhood .",
    "previous determinations have all been indirect , and hence suffer from large uncertainities .",
    "the method we have described here is quite straightforward , and could be applied to many systems .",
    "the derived value of @xmath18 , which is effectively the average ratio near one photometric scale length , is somewhat higher than the solar neighbourhood value of 0.52 @xmath17 0.03 that wielen ( 1977 ) derived from the mccormick sample of k and m dwarfs .",
    "however , the error of 0.03 is the purely statistical error , but the scatter between the published observational estimates of this ratio suggests that the true error may be larger ( see lacey 1991 ) .",
    "any difference between the two ratios is consistent with the findings about the relative effects of the two dominant heating mechanisms , molecular clouds and spiral structure , as we now show .",
    "heating by molecular clouds was originally proposed by spitzer and schwarzschild ( 1951 ) .",
    "they proposed that stars in star - cloud encounters gain kinetic energy at the expense of the clouds because of the huge masses of the latter .",
    "subsequent analysis by lacey ( 1984 ) and @xmath19-body simulations by villumsen ( 1985 ) showed however that this mechanism saturates rather quickly ( once the stars have sufficient energy that they spend most of their time outside the cloud layer the heating rate drops ) and could not fully explain the observed heating .    an alternative proposal to heat the disk , due to barbanis and woltjer ( 1967 ) , explains the heating as the result of stars scattering from spiral irregularities in the galactic potential .",
    "carlberg and sellwood ( 1985 ) have extended this work and showed that this can indeed heat up the disk .",
    "however this process can not heat the stars efficiently in the vertical direction because the vertical oscillation frequency of stars is much larger than the frequency at which a spiral wave sweeps past the stars orbiting the disk .",
    "hence the stars respond almost adiabatically to this force .",
    "giant molecular clouds create large spiral wakes , often much larger than a cloud itself ( julian and toomre 1966 ) .",
    "this interplay between clouds and spiral irregularities is not yet completely understood but it is clear that they are not independent .",
    "jenkins and binney ( 1990 ) examined the combined effects of both processes based on monte carlo simulations of the fokker - planck equation describing these processes .",
    "they expressed the relative importance of heating by spiral structure to heating by clouds by a parameter denoted @xmath20 and calculated the corresponding ratio of @xmath21 ( see their figure 2 ) . from the observed shape of the velocity ellipsoid and velocity dispersion - age relations they concluded that in the solar neighbourhood the heating of the disk is dominated by spiral structure ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the mean surface density of the cloud layer near the sun is 1.8 @xmath23 pc@xmath24 ( clemens , sanders and scoville 1988 ) . from the fcrao extragalactic co survey ( young et al .",
    "1995 ) a mean surface density for ngc 488 is derived of 3.5 @xmath23 pc@xmath24 .",
    "( young et al .",
    "find that the co layer in ngc 488 is best described by a uniform distribution with a radius of 1.65 arcmin and a co flux of @xmath25 jy km / s . ) , higher than in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "ngc 488 is classified as an sb galaxy .",
    "it has a very regular tightly wound spiral pattern ( the pitch angle is only 5@xmath26 ) .",
    "it is therefore quite likely that the potential associated with this spiral pattern is much smoother that that of our own galaxy , which has an sbc hubble type .",
    "both these observations imply that the parameter @xmath20 must be smaller for ngc 488 than for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "according to the predictions of jenkins and binney a smaller @xmath20 corresponds to a larger @xmath21 ratio .",
    "we do indeed find that the @xmath21 ratio for ngc  488 is higher than for the milky way , however the difference is only one sigma .",
    "we conclude therefore that the shape of the velocity ellipsoid that we have determined is qualitatively consistent with the picture sketched by jenkins and binney .",
    "the technique we have described in this paper would be straightforward to apply to a larger sample of disk galaxies . with higher quality data",
    ", it would also be possible to extend the analysis to map out the radial variation of the velocity ellipsoid shape , a quantity which has never been observationally constrained .",
    "both projects would provide important measurements for comparison with the theoretical treatments of the heating processes in stellar disks .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained using the multiple mirror telescope , which is a joint facility of the smithsonian institute and the university of arizona .",
    "much of the analysis was performed using iraf , which is distributed by noao .",
