    "the transition metals and their oxides are well known for exhibiting a variety of magnetic ordering phenomena @xcite .",
    "the nature of the low - temperature magnetically ordered states depends on the type of dominant magnetic exchange interactions , which in turn depend on the details of the crystal structure and electronic band structure .",
    "the theoretical models that describe magnetism in solids can be divided into three broad categories : ( i ) models that do not _ apriori _ contain a local moment but allow for moment formation via electron - electron interactions , such as the hubbard model @xcite , ( ii ) models consisting of localized spins only , such as the heisenberg model , and ( iii ) models that have itinerant electrons coupled to localized moments , e.g. , the kondo lattice model @xcite . starting with a general multi - orbital hubbard model",
    ", the other two types can be obtained in appropriate limits @xcite .",
    "hence , the hubbard model is the elementary model for describing magnetism .",
    "indeed , two of the most common magnetically ordered ground states , the ferromagnet and the staggered antiferromagnet , are present in the mean - field phase diagram of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "search for non - collinear and non - coplanar magnetic ordering in models and materials has emerged as an important research topic in recent years .",
    "the reason being the fundamental connection between the nature of magnetic order and electrical properties of various magnetic materials .",
    "a non - coplanar magnetic order is known to give rise to anomalous hall response in transport @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a planar spiral order can allow for a ferroelectric response via the spin - current mechanism @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies on kondo - lattice models have shown that a variety of unconventional magnetic ground states can be stabilized depending on the underlying lattice geometry and electronic filling fraction .",
    "in particular , triangular and checkerboard lattices allow for non - coplanar magnetism at quarter filling of the band @xcite .",
    "more recently , existence of spin - charge ordered phases has also been reported at the average filling fraction of two electrons per three sites @xcite .",
    "given that the hubbard model is the fundamental model for magnetism , it is important to know if the unconventional magnetic phases found in the kondo - lattice hamiltonian are also present in the hubbard model .",
    "moreover , for some of the magnetic phases the shape of the fermi surface plays a crucial role and the ordered phases should therefore be independent of the nature of interactions @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "a systematic search across the electronic density range for non - collinear and non - coplanar magnetic phases in the hubbard model on triangular lattice has not been reported .    in this work ,",
    "we map out the magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model on anisotropic triangular lattice within a variational mean - field approach that captures the non - collinear and non - coplanar magnetism on same footing as the collinear magnetism .",
    "the phase diagram is rich and consists of many unconventional phases that are found in the corresponding kondo - lattice model .",
    "these include , ( i ) the four - sublattice 3q order at quarter filling , ( ii ) the flux state at quarter filling , ( iii ) the non - collinear charge ordered phase at two - third filling .",
    "in addition , the 120@xmath0state is stable near the isotropic triangular limit and a collinear stripe state is stable in the anisotropic regime .",
    "the influence of nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion on these phases is also investigated .",
    "we find that a pinball - liquid like charge ordering phase , which has so far been reported in spinless fermion models or multi - orbital models on triangular lattice @xcite , is stabilized by the coulomb interactions at a filling fraction of @xmath2 and occurs concomitantly with either collinear or non - collinear magnetic order .",
    "given the fundamental nature of the hubbard hamiltonian , our results are of general interest .",
    "in addition , the reported phases are of specific relevance to various triangular lattice systems , such as the layered agnio@xmath3 @xcite , the nacoo@xmath3 @xcite and the organic charge - transfer salts @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model and briefly discuss the previous investigations that focus on non - collinear magnetism . in section iii",
    "we describe the method used in this work .",
    "results and discussions follow in section iv , where we first discuss the density versus interaction phase diagram , and then discuss the phase diagrams corresponding to specific electronic filling fractions . in section v we analyze the effect of nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion on the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "the single - orbital hubbard hamiltonian on an anisotropic triangular lattice is given by ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator , and @xmath6 is the number operator for electrons with spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 .",
    "the total number operator for electrons at site @xmath8 is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the chemical potential .",
    "the electronic hopping amplitudes between nearest neighbor sites on triangular lattice are @xmath11 and @xmath12 as shown in fig . 1 , and @xmath13 denotes the on - site hubbard repulsion .",
    "the hubbard model is one of the most successful and well studied hamiltonians in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "however , due to its relevance to various materials , certain filling fractions have been of more interest than others .",
    "for instance , the model on square lattice ( @xmath14 ) has been studied in great detail near half filling .",
    "very few studies have explored the possibility for non - collinear and non - coplanar phases @xcite .",
    "the half - filled case on triangular lattice has also been explored in search of spin liquid phases , as the large @xmath13 limit of the hubbard model leads to the spin-@xmath15 heisenberg model which is frustrated on the triangular geometry .",
    "there have been studies for the quarter filled case , which describes the physics of organic charge transfer salts @xcite .",
    "the filling fraction of @xmath2 has also been of interest due to its relevance to layered agnio@xmath3 and nacoo@xmath3 . a systematic search for non - collinear and ,",
    "in particular , non - coplanar phases over the full range of electronic densities has not been reported even at the mean field level .",
    "we determine the ground state phase diagrams by performing a systematic search in the phase space of various ordered magnetic configurations .",
    "this is achieved by making use of the rotational invariance of the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "before describing the details of the rotationally invariant scheme , let us recall the commonly used unrestricted hartree fock ( uhf ) method @xcite . in this method , the interaction term is decoupled into charge and spin sectors .",
    "ignoring the 2nd order term in fluctuations , the hamiltonian reduces to the well known form ,    @xmath16 \\nonumber   \\\\     & & - \\lambda u \\sum\\limits_{i } [ \\langle s^{+}_{i } \\rangle s^{-}_i+     \\langle s^{-}_{i } \\rangle s^{+}_i-\\langle s^{+}_{i}\\rangle \\langle s^{-}_{i } \\rangle],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the spin operators .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath19 determines the relative contribution of the hartree and the fock terms in the mean - field decoupling .    in the uhf approach ,",
    "the site dependence of the quantum averages is retained .",
    "starting from a random guess for the various mean - field parameters , the hamiltonian is diagonalized iteratively until self - consistency is achieved . in principle",
    ", the self - consistent solution depends on the starting configuration of mean - field parameters .",
    "therefore , it is required to use a large number of starting configurations .",
    "the reliability of the final solution obtained in this way depends to a large extent on the complexity of the energy landscape .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 should be determined via an energy minimization over the various self - consistent solutions .",
    "although , this scheme can capture the conventional ordered magnetic phases very well , it can easily miss out on non - collinear and non - coplanar magnetic orderings .",
    "motivated by the appearance of such unusual magnetically ordered phases in a kondo lattice model , we search for similar magnetic phases in the hubbard model . for this purpose , we recast the mean - field decouplings in a way that allows for a systematical search of a variety of ordered phases .",
    "we begin by re - writing the hamiltonian in a reference frame with site - dependent spin - quantization axes @xcite .",
    "this is done by performing local su(2 ) rotations of the quantization axes , given by ,    @xmath20 & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }   cos(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{2 } ) e^{i\\frac{\\phi_{i}}{2 } } &   -sin(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{2 } ) e^{i\\frac{\\phi_{i}}{2}}\\\\   sin(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{2 } ) e^{-i\\frac{\\phi_{i}}{2 } } & cos(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{2 } ) e^{-i\\frac{\\phi_{i}}{2}}\\\\   \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } d_{ip}\\\\ d_{ia}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "{ \\cal r}(\\theta_{j } , \\phi_{j})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we consider two broad categories of variational states .",
    "first one is the set of general non - coplanar spiral states which can be parameterized by a cone angle @xmath27 and a spiral wave vector @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angles of the spins are then given by , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the other set of states are the block - periodic states , where the spin configuration of a @xmath31 block is repeated periodically to generate the configuration over the entire lattice .",
    "the choice of these variational states is motivated by the presence of various long - range ordered phases in the corresponding kondo - lattice model . the flux state and the non - coplanar states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are examples of the @xmath32 block - periodic states . in the flux state",
    "the azimuthal angles of the neighboring spins differ by @xmath33 while the polar angle remains equal to @xmath33",
    ". the non - coplanar state can be obtained from the flux state by changing the polar angles of the four spins as shown in fig .",
    "similarly we take a @xmath34 block to capture the 120@xmath0state , which can be connected to a ferromagnetic state by varying the polar angle from @xmath33 to 0 . in order to allow for the six - sublattice non - collinear charge ordered ( nc - co ) state at @xmath2",
    ", we take a @xmath35 cluster as the building block @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been performed in both canonical and grand canonical approaches . in the grand canonical ( canonical )",
    "approach , we seek a self - consistent solution for a given fixed value of chemical potential ( density ) for all the variational states discussed above . in cases",
    "where more than one self - consistent solutions exists , the lower energy solution is selected and the corresponding state is taken as the mean - field ground state at that value of the chemical potential ( density ) . for the grand canonical approach ,",
    "the density corresponding to the ground state solution is calculated at the given value of the chemical potential and the phase diagrams are presented with density as a parameter .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained by using the mean - field decoupling scheme described in the previous section .",
    "for most of the calculations we used @xmath36 @xmath37-points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "results have also been checked for @xmath38 in some cases . in the following subsection",
    "we discuss the @xmath1-@xmath13 phase diagrams for different values of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath13 phase diagrams are obtained within the grand canonical approach .",
    "the energy minimization over the two sets of variational states is performed for a fixed value of chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "the chemical potential is then systematically varied in order to obtain different average electronic densities .",
    "the total energy is computed at zero temperature , where the fermi function simply becomes a step function .",
    "the grand canonical approach has an advantage that it allows for the phase separation regions , which commonly arise in electronic systems , to be easily captured .    for @xmath40 ,",
    "the hopping connectivity is that of a square lattice .",
    "therefore , in this case we display the density range @xmath41 in the phase diagram as the system is particle - hole symmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( @xmath42 ) ) .",
    "the square lattice phase diagram is dominated by three simple phases : a fermi liquid state for weak to intermediate @xmath13 and away from @xmath43 , an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state near @xmath43 and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state for large @xmath13 and away from @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , in the intermediate @xmath13 range we find a flux phase and a narrow window of phase separation close to @xmath44 .",
    "the flux phase is known to exits in the kondo - lattice model with a classical approximation for local moments @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported recently in he uhf study of a five - orbital hubbard model for iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "the planar spiral states are stable over a wide range of parameters .",
    "next , we present the phase diagram for the anisotropic case where the particle - hole symmetry does not hold . therefore , the density range displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( @xmath45)-(@xmath46 ) is @xmath47 .",
    "the fm state is strongly suppressed by the triangular anisotropy in the low - density regime , whereas it still dominates the large density regime .",
    "this can be explained by invoking the stoner picture for ferromagnetism : the triangular lattice density of states is higher if the fermi level is located close to @xmath48 and therefore the stoner criterion for ferromagnetism can be satisfied for relatively small values of @xmath13 .",
    "the flux state remains stable in a narrow window around intermediate @xmath13 and @xmath44 .",
    "a new magnetically ordered state enters the phase diagram near @xmath43 .",
    "this is the well known @xmath49-state which is the classical ground state of a triangular lattice heisenberg model .",
    "a wider window of phase separation appears in @xmath50 regime @xcite , where a conical spiral state also becomes stable .",
    "the phase diagram remains qualitatively similar between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "however , the isotropic triangular case ( @xmath53 ) gives rise to new and interesting phases .",
    "the first of these new phases is the 4-sublattice non - coplanar order near @xmath44 .",
    "this unusual magnetic state , also known as 3q state , is of wide interest as it supports a non - vanishing scalar spin chirality and an associated quantized hall conductivity @xcite .",
    "the quantized hall conductivity is related to the nontrivial topology of the electronic band structure that the 3q state induces in the kondo hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the 3q state was predicted to be stable in the hubbard model at @xmath48 based on fermi surface nesting arguments @xcite .",
    "we find that the 3q state is stable at @xmath48 only for @xmath54 and loses to fm order for larger values of @xmath13 .",
    "the second new state that appears exactly at @xmath2 is the recently reported @xmath55-sublattice non - collinear charge ordered ( nc - co ) state .",
    "in addition , the @xmath56 ordered afm state completely disappears , and instead the @xmath49-state dominates the phase diagram near @xmath43 , as expected @xcite .",
    "having discussed the overall structure of the @xmath1-@xmath13 phase diagrams , we now examine more closely the effect of anisotropic hopping connectivity on different magnetic phases at specific filling fractions .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the @xmath12-@xmath13 phase diagrams obtained within canonical ensemble approach , where the minimization is performed over the variational parameters for a fixed value of the average electronic density @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the evolution of various phases as the lattice connectivity changes from square type to triangular type .",
    "the non - collinear flux phase is lowest energy state for unfrustrated square lattice ( @xmath60 ) at @xmath44 for intermediate coupling strength .",
    "this state remains stable in a wide parameter regime , @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , the stability window of the flux state widens in terms of the @xmath13 values upon increasing @xmath39 ( see fig . [ fig3](@xmath42 ) ) . for @xmath62 ,",
    "a non - coplanar state becomes stable which evolves into the 3q state at @xmath63 .",
    "the evolution from the flux state to the 3q non - coplanar state is depicted by the change in variational angle @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( @xmath42 ) ) . for the flux state",
    "@xmath65 , whereas for the perfect 3q state @xmath66 .",
    "the other effect of the triangular geometry for @xmath44 is to suppress the fm phase .",
    "the fm phase give way to planar spiral phases even for small values of the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the transition from a non - magnetic fermi liquid state to a magnetic state also occurs at a slightly larger value of @xmath13 for the triangular lattice in comparison to the square lattice .",
    "another unusual six - sublattice magnetic order was recently reported in the kondo - lattice model for average density of two electrons per three sites @xcite . in order to explore the possibility of this phase in the hubbard model",
    ", we focus on the filling fraction of @xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig3](@xmath45 ) ) .",
    "we again find that the fm state is suppressed in favor of the planar spiral states .",
    "additionally the @xmath49 order is stable for @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the stability window of the @xmath49 state at @xmath2 is even wider than that at @xmath43 .",
    "importantly , we find that the six - sublattice nc - co order is the ground state for @xmath68 and for @xmath69 .",
    "the half - filling , @xmath43 , is the most commonly studied filling fraction in the hubbard models on triangular and square lattice @xcite . within the mean - field ,",
    "we find that the afm order is robust and is stable in the regime @xmath70 . beyond @xmath52",
    ", the afm order continuously evolves towards the @xmath49 state . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](@xmath42 ) , we show the change in the spiral wave - vector @xmath71 from @xmath56 to @xmath72 .",
    "the half - filling case is also of interest for the possible existence of a spin - liquid state @xcite .",
    "however , our mean - field method does not capture the spin - liquid states and therefore we can not comment on this competition in the present paper .",
    "finally we discuss the filling fraction @xmath48 , which is interesting due to the presence of fermi - surface nesting feature in the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the non - coplanar 3q state was first predicted based on the nesting property of the fermi surface . clearly , for small @xmath13 the 3q state is the ground state due to the presence of a peculiar fermi surface nesting in the non - interacting hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the 3q order loses to fm order for @xmath73 .",
    "the relative stability of the 3q state at @xmath44 and @xmath48 was also explored in the kondo - lattice hamiltonian with a conclusion that the window of stability of the 3q state is wider for @xmath44 compared to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "our calculations on the hubbard model support the results of the corresponding kondo - lattice model . in sharp contrast to the quarter filling ( @xmath44 ) , the three - quarter filling favors fm state for increasing @xmath39 . as mentioned earlier , this can be understood from the particle - hole asymmetry and large dos in the @xmath50 regime for the triangular lattice .",
    "the electronic spectrum corresponding to different phases is displayed in the plots for the density of states in fig .",

    "all the three possible varieties of the spectra are present : the spiral states are metallic , the 3q non - coplanar , the @xmath56 afm and the nc - co states are insulating , and the flux state is semimettalic with a graphene - like dos . a robust gap in the dos is suggestive of the stability of these phases against higher - order quantum corrections .",
    "in this section we analyze the influence of nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion on various magnetic phases discussed so far .",
    "we begin by extending the hubbard model eq .",
    "( 1 ) by including a nn repulsion .",
    "the extended hubbard hamiltonian is given by ,    @xmath80    the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the strength of the coulomb repulsion along inequivalent directions on the anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "it is well known that nn coulomb repulsion in bipartite lattices favors charge ordering @xcite .",
    "however , the triangular geometry frustrates the checkerboard type charge ordering and leads to exotic charge ordered phases , such as the pinball liquid and inverse pinball liquid @xcite . here",
    "our primary focus is to study the effect of nn coulomb repulsions on the various magnetic phases found in the hubbard model .",
    "we present results for the quarter - filled case where the interesting mean - field ground states are the flux state , for @xmath83 , and non - coplanar states for @xmath62 .",
    "we use the variational scheme corresponding to the block - periodic states discussed in sec .",
    "this allows for four inequivalent sites in terms of the spin and charge structures .",
    "the planar structure is fixed to be of the flux type and the polar angle is varied to obtain magnetic phases that interpolate between the flux and the ( @xmath84 ) afm state via the 3q state ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "results for @xmath85 are summarized in fig .",
    "we find that the flux state ( @xmath40 ) is compatible with stripe charge ordering . indeed",
    ", the charge disproportionation @xmath86 becomes finite as soon as @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath42 ) ) .",
    "the magnetic structure retains the flux character , however , the magnetic moments become unequal on sites @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( @xmath42)-(@xmath90 ) ) . for very large values of @xmath81",
    "the magnetic moment becomes vanishingly small at one of the sites , leading to a strongly charge ordered afm state .",
    "in fact , a similar state has been reported in the quarter - filled hubbard - holstein , and kondo lattice models on square lattice @xcite .",
    "the nature of the magnetic order is depicted by the value of the variational polar angle @xmath64 corresponding to the minimum energy self - consistent solution .",
    "@xmath65 remains constant for @xmath40 ( see inset in fig [ fig5 ] ( @xmath46 ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the flux state , the 3q state competes with charge ordering .",
    "it is easy to understand this difference from the energetics : charge ordering leads to lowering of energy via opening an energy gap in the spectrum .",
    "since the flux state is gapless , a gap opening lowers the energy and therefore the ground state develops a charge ordering even for small values of @xmath81 .",
    "however , the 3q state is already gapped with the origin of the gap tied to peculiar magnetic structure .",
    "therefore , in order to further lower the energy the charge ordering must open a gap that off - sets the 3q gap . starting with @xmath63 ,",
    "the charge disproportionation remains zero until @xmath91 .",
    "a weak reduction of the magnetic moment occurs near @xmath92 together with a deviation from the ideal 3q structure . near @xmath52",
    ", @xmath86 becomes finite , and the magnetic moment at site @xmath88 vanishes , leading to the same charge ordered afm state as for @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , in this case the 3q state is destabilized at the onset of charge ordering . the density of states ( fig . [ fig5](@xmath90)-(@xmath46 ) ) show that a gap opens in the electronic spectrum owing to the charge ordering .",
    "thus , the semimettalic flux state is turned into a fully gapped flux state , and eventually into a gapped collinear afm for large @xmath81 .",
    "the results for the isotropic repulsive ( @xmath93 ) case are qualitatively similar to those discussed above .",
    "the main difference is that the charge disproportionation is smaller for @xmath93 compared to @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we study the effect of coulomb repulsion on the 120@xmath0phase .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "the 120@xmath0state is destabilized in favor of a collinear state containing three inequivalent sites .",
    "two of the sites have equal charge density which is larger than that on the third ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the magnetic moments on the low - charge sites vanish , while those on the other two sites are antialligned ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( @xmath42)-(@xmath45 ) and [ fig7](@xmath46 ) ) .",
    "the resulting spin - charge order can be visualized as two interpenetrating lattices : an afm ordered honeycomb lattice and a nonmagnetic triangular lattice .",
    "this spontaneous separation into two sublattices is similar to what happens in the pinball - liquid phase .",
    "the crucial difference being the insulating character of the dos in the present case . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the charge densities on the three sites are given by @xmath97 , and all three sites have finite magnetic moments .",
    "the resulting state with up - up - down structure have also been found as the ground state of the ising spin kondo lattice model .",
    "for @xmath98 the charge densities at three sites are given by @xmath99 , and the magnetic state again becomes non - collinear ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig6](@xmath45 ) ) . upon a further increase of @xmath81 the charge density as well as the magnetic moment on one of the sites keep reducing , giving rise to an effective honeycomb lattice for the electrons in the large @xmath81 limit",

    ", we uncover a rich phase diagram for the hamiltonian on anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "the most notable of the unconventional magnetic ground states are , ( i ) the four - sublattice flux order , ( ii ) the 3q non - coplanar state , and ( iii ) the six - sublattice non - collinear charge ordered state .",
    "these states have been found as ground states of the kondo lattice model on triangular lattice in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the effect of nearest neighbor coulomb interactions on these magnetic states is also investigated , and leads to some fascinating spin - charge ordered phases .",
    "the flux state is found to be compatible with a stripe - like charge ordered arrangement , whereas , the non - coplanar 3q state competes with charge ordering and becomes unstable upon increasing the coulomb interaction strength beyond a critical value . the spin - charge ordered state found at @xmath44 is a triangular lattice version of the state found in quarter - filled hubbard - holstein and kondo lattice models @xcite .",
    "the 120@xmath0state gives way to a sequence of spin - charge ordered states which lead to spontaneous decoupling of the triangular lattice into a honeycomb lattice and a triangular lattice .",
    "for a certain range of parameter values , one of the sublattice is magnetic while the other is nonmagnetic .",
    "this highly resembles the pinball - liquid state reported in theoretical studies of multiband extended hubbard model on triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams presented here set the stage for further studies to analyze the stability of these phases .",
    "a number of states reported here possess a robust gap in the electronic spectrum , and therefore are likely to remain stable against higher order quantum effects .",

    "<S> motivated by the importance of non - collinear and non - coplanar magnetic phases in determining various electrical properties of magnetic materials , we investigate the phase diagrams of the extended hubbard model on anisotropic triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of a mean - field scheme that treats collinear , non - collinear and non - coplanar phases on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the ferromagnetic and 120@xmath0antiferromagnetic phases , we find the four - sublattice flux , the 3q non - coplanar and the non - collinear charge - ordered states to be stable at specific values of filling fraction @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> inter - site coulomb repulsion leads to intriguing spin - charge ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> most notable of these are the collinear and non - collinear magnetic states at @xmath2 , which occur together with a pinball - liquid - like charge order . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the elementary single - orbital extended hubbard model on a triangular lattice hosts unconventional spin - charge ordered phases , which have been reported in more complex and material - specific electronic hamiltonians relevant to layered triangular systems . </S>"
