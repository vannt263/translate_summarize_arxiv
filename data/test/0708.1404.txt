    "the notion of unparticles was recently introduced by georgi  @xcite as an interesting possibility for physics beyond the standard model . in this scenario",
    ", there is a hidden sector with a non - trivial infrared fixed point , @xmath0 , below which the sector exhibits scale invariance . at energies above @xmath0 , a hidden - sector operator @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 couples to standard model operators @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 via the exchange of heavy particles of mass @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 the hidden sector becomes scale invariant at @xmath0 .",
    "the couplings then become @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unparticle operator of dimension @xmath9 in the low - energy limit , and @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "because of scale invariance , the phase space for @xmath8 resembles that of @xmath9 massless particles ; the salient feature of the unparticle sector is that @xmath9 may take on non - integer values .",
    "unparticle phenomenology has been investigated in a large number of recent papers  @xcite .",
    "if the unparticle sector indeed appears at low energies in the form of new massless fields coupled very weakly to standard model particles , one expects that the usual stellar energy - loss limits  @xcite , notably from the neutrino burst duration of sn  1987a , will provide much more restrictive limits than any laboratory experiment could achieve .",
    "invisible axions  @xcite and kaluza - klein gravitons  @xcite are typical examples where astrophysical limits preclude any realistic hope of finding these particles directly in collider experiments , and the same is expected for unparticles as noted by davoudiasl  @xcite .",
    "we will here elaborate this idea in some detail .",
    "if a scalar unparticle operator of dimension @xmath11 couples to the standard - model higgs , then scale invariance in the hidden sector is broken once the higgs acquires a non - zero vev so that there is no unparticle signature at low energies  @xcite . in this case",
    "the sn  1987a energy - loss argument is moot .",
    "therefore , the astrophysical limit serves to constrain the possible realizations of the unparticle concept that could show up as missing energy at colliders .    the dominant lowest - order process for the emission of new particles @xmath12 in a sn core tends to be nucleon bremsstrahlung @xmath13 .",
    "the nucleon density is huge .",
    "their interaction rate is large , and this process involves the small coupling of the new particles to lowest order",
    ". the emission of unparticles will be fully analogous , apart from phase - space modifications .",
    "in addition , processes of the form @xmath14 now have a nonvanishing phase space and provide additional contributions .",
    "therefore , the sn  1987a energy - loss argument provides very restrictive constraints on the unparticle couplings to nucleons , neutrinos , electrons and muons .",
    "we note that the sn  1987a emission bound is much stronger than other astrophysical constraints , as is also the case for kaluza - klein graviton emission .",
    "numerical studies of sn energy losses by axions or kaluza - klein gravitons reveal that the neutrino burst would have been excessively shortened unless the volume energy - loss rate of the sn core obeys  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is to be calculated at the benchmark conditions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "armed with this simple criterion , all that is needed is an estimate of @xmath16 for unparticle emission .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : bremsstrahlung ] with the nucleon bremsstrahlung process , stressing its general features for the emission of different types of new radiation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pairs ] we consider the pair - annihilation process for various particles that are abundant in a sn core .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a reliable calculation of the bremsstrahlung rate @xmath13 in a sn core is not possible because the @xmath19 interaction potential is not well known , @xmath19 correlation effects are likely strong , and multiple - scattering effects can be important . therefore , one can not do much better than an `` educated dimensional analysis '' based on simple principles .    in the limit @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the frequency of the emitted radiation , bremsstrahlung factorizes into an essentially classical radiation process and the ordinary collision .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that for nucleons one can estimate the collision rate from measured cross sections or phase shifts even without a detailed model of the interaction potential  @xcite .    assuming weakly interacting radiation we can employ lowest - order perturbation theory for the interaction between the radiation and the medium .",
    "the emitted power is then a phase - space integral over the dynamical structure function @xmath22 of the medium . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the thermal average of a correlator of the operator to which the radiation couples . while we do not know the dynamical structure function for a strongly interacting medium",
    ", we can still take advantage of its general properties .",
    "in particular , the principle of detailed balancing tells us that the probability for emitting a quantum of energy @xmath21 from a thermal medium is @xmath24 times the probability of absorbing one .",
    "these ideas suggest that the volume energy - loss rate is roughly given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nucleon scattering cross section , @xmath27 their relative velocity , and @xmath28 their number density ( the baryon density ) .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath29 is the spectrum of energy emitted in a single collision and includes all coupling constants and the radiation phase space .",
    "typically @xmath29 is of the power - law form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a coupling constant of dimension @xmath32 and includes numerical factors .",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath33 where we have ignored a numerical factor @xmath34 that plays little role as long as @xmath35 is not too large .      the usual axion constraints from sn  1987a were derived along these lines  @xcite .",
    "moreover , two of us have carried out this exercise in detail , including all numerical factors , for the case of graviton bremsstrahlung  @xcite . in this case",
    "the classical emission rate is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is newton s constant , @xmath38 the nucleon mass , @xmath27 the velocity of the colliding nucleons , and @xmath39 the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 plays the role of the square of a dimensionless coupling constant and the @xmath41 behavior reflects the quadrupole nature of the radiation . assuming that @xmath19 scattering is isotropic with a total cross section @xmath26 , after performing the nucleon phase - space integral as well as the @xmath42 integration it was found that @xmath43   \\times\\left[\\sigma\\,n_b^2\\ ,   \\left(\\frac{3t}{m}\\right)^{5/2}\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] of course it is somewhat arbitrary how to group the numerical factors .",
    "we note that the average velocity of thermal nucleons is given by @xmath44 so that @xmath45 , motivating the use of @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 in the last term that derives from the nucleon velocity factors .",
    "( four powers of velocity come from the quadrupole nature of the radiation , and another factor from the @xmath19 relative velocity . ) in this way the overall numerical coefficient is 0.818 and thus very close to unity .",
    "graviton bremsstrahlung has a flat spectrum so that we have @xmath48 in the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qpower ] ) , implying a simple factor @xmath49 within the first term .      in the simplest case unparticles couple via a vector current to nucleons , an assumption made in all previous studies .",
    "the structure of the coupling is @xmath50 nucleon bremsstrahlung would then seem to be normal dipole emission similar to electromagnetic bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , if the interaction with all nucleons is the same , bremsstrahlung is suppressed in the nonrelativistic limit , just as it is suppressed in the nonrelativistic limit for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we expect quadrupole radiation to dominate , involving a factor @xmath41 as in graviton bremsstrahlung .    therefore , we scale the emission rate from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qgrav ] ) , keeping the second factor that encodes the quadrupole nature and nucleon phase space , while adapting the first factor to the unparticle case . from dimensional",
    "analysis we thus expect @xmath52    to evaluate this rate we assume @xmath53 that is typical for the relevant conditions and was recommended in the context of kaluza - klein graviton emission  @xcite .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : sncriterion ] ) we find the constraint @xmath54 assuming @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we find @xmath57 where we have set @xmath58 for simplicity .",
    "these bounds are almost identical to those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from scaling the usual axion limits to the unparticle case .",
    "this is not strictly correct since the coupling structure of axions is different ( axial instead of vector ) .",
    "note that if the nucleon - unparticle coupling was axial the bound should become somewhat stronger because there would be no @xmath41 quadrupole suppression .",
    "figure  [ fig : m - lambda ] shows the same constraints on the @xmath59-plane .",
    "these should be compared with analogous bounds from collider experiments in , e.g. , fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "the sn limits are always far more restrictive . as an illustration , for @xmath60 , ref .",
    "@xcite quotes the constraints @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , to be compared with our much more severe sn limits @xmath67 ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath64 ) , and @xmath69 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    ", for @xmath62 , 3/2 , and 2 as indicated",
    ". the regions below the contours are excluded .",
    "[ fig : m - lambda],width=283 ]",
    "for massless particles @xmath12 , the process @xmath70 is forbidden because of energy - momentum conservation . at next order the process @xmath71",
    "is highly suppressed because of the additional power of the coupling constant . for unparticles ,",
    "however , the process @xmath14 is allowed and can be a dominant energy - loss process in a sn core .",
    "the emissivity from pair annihilation of neutrinos is roughly estimated by @xmath72 which leads to the constraints , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 assuming @xmath55 and @xmath56 as before .    for @xmath64 and @xmath75 these bounds are almost identical to those deduced from bremsstrahlung in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bounds ] ) , although they are based on different physics .",
    "the reason is that the smaller neutrino density is compensated by the fact that the @xmath76 channel is not suppressed by the @xmath41 factor . for different values of @xmath5",
    "the bounds on @xmath0 scale in the same way as those from the bremsstrahlung calculation so that the results of fig .  [ fig : m - lambda ] apply also in this case .",
    "no bound exists for @xmath62 from @xmath14 , since this case corresponds to annihilation into a single massless particle , and its rate must vanish exactly because of energy - momentum conservation ,    the bounds eq .",
    "( [ eq : ann ] ) were calculated assuming non - degenerate , relativistic fermions .",
    "this approximation is very good for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "however , electron neutrinos are degenerate with a chemical potential @xmath79 typically of order @xmath80@xmath81  mev , implying a degeneracy parameter around 57 for @xmath82 .",
    "the presence of a chemical potential reduces the number of pairs , i.e. , the quantity @xmath83 is largest for a vanishing chemical potential .",
    "however , for degeneracy factors up to roughly 8 the suppression of the annihilation rate is less than an order of magnitude ( for illustration see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the degeneracy factor for electrons is only slightly larger so that the suppression of @xmath84 annihilation is only slightly worse .    because of its high temperature the hot proto - neutron star is also abundant in muons .",
    "the muon rest mass of 106 mev does not lead to a very substantial difference in number density relative to massless fermions . at @xmath82",
    "the number density of muons is suppressed only by a factor @xmath85 relative to massless fermions , always ignoring chemical potentials that are small for muons in a sn core",
    ". an additional suppression factor of about 0.5 comes from the relative velocity of muons so that the annihilation rate overall is roughly 0.2 times that of a massless fermion species .",
    "lastly , we note that a bound on the @xmath62 scenario can still be obtained from pair annihilation of charged leptons based on the process @xmath86 or @xmath87 which is not phase - space suppressed . since the squared matrix element is suppressed only by @xmath88 relative to @xmath89 , the bound for @xmath62 can be estimated from taking the emissivity as @xmath90 times the naive rate given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair ] ) , and taking into account the suppression from degeneracy ( electrons ) or the mass threshold ( muons ) .",
    "note that for @xmath62 the suppression factors enter as a fourth root , giving an estimated bound for @xmath62 of @xmath91  gev for @xmath56 .",
    "given the overall numerical uncertainties of our limits , we conclude that the pair annihilation and bremsstrahlung limits are nearly identical for all cases , i.e. , apart from possible difference in the overall coefficients @xmath10 to different particle species , the interaction with nucleons , neutrinos of all flavors , electrons and muons are constrained by the limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - lambda ] .",
    "we have applied the well - known energy - loss limit based on the sn  1987a neutrino burst duration to georgi s new idea of unparticles that can manifest themselves as missing energy in collider experiments with a peculiar phase - space behavior . as expected , the sn limits are very restrictive as long as the unparticle radiation can be emitted without threshold at the relatively low energies prevalent in the sn context .",
    "our approximate constraints shown in fig .  [ fig : m - lambda ] apply without significant modifications to nucleons , neutrinos of all flavors , electrons and muons .",
    "unparticle signatures can still be detected at colliders in models where scale invariance in the hidden sector is broken by the higgs vacuum expectation value . in this case",
    "the sn emission is suppressed by threshold effects .",
    "thus our astrophysical limits provide a severe restriction on the type of unparticle models that can be detected at colliders .",
