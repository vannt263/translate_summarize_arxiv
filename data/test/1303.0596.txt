    "neutrino oscillations give the first and so far unique evidence for lepton flavor violation  ( lfv ) , forbidden in the standard model  ( sm ) . knowing that _ lepton flavor _ is a non - conserving quantity , it is natural to expect lfv effects also in the sector of charged leptons , although so far these effects have not been experimentally observed .",
    "theoretically lfv in the neutrino sector , originating from the non - diagonal neutrino mass matrix , is transmitted to the charged lepton sector at the loop - level , in the form of penguin and box diagrams with virtual neutrinos .",
    "however , these effects are glashow - iliopoulos - maini ( gim)-like suppressed down to the level of @xmath1 , being far beyond the experimental reach . on the other hand , the charged lepton sector may receive other lfv contributions from physics beyond the sm , attributed to a certain high - energy scale @xmath2 , which is not a priori necessarily very high and which may provide observable lfv phenomena .",
    "thus , searching for lepton flavor violation in reactions with charged leptons offers a good opportunity for getting information on possible physics beyond the sm .",

    "the theoretical studies of conversion , presented in the literature , cover various aspects of this lfv process : the adequate treatment of structure effects  @xcite of the nucleus participating in the reaction and the underlying mechanisms of lfv at the quark level within different scenarios of physics beyond the sm ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "<S> we revisit the status of lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) @xmath0 contact interactions from the view point of -conversion in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we consider their contribution to this lfv process via the two mechanisms on the hadronic level : direct nucleon and meson exchange ones . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> the quarks are embedded directly into the nucleons while in the latter in mesons which then interact with nucleons in a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we revise and in some cases reevaluate the hadronic parameters relevant for both mechanisms and calculate the contribution of the above mentioned contact interactions in coherent -conversion in various nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> then we update our previous upper bounds and derive new ones for the scales of the @xmath0 contact interactions from the experimental limits on the capture rates of -conversion . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these limits with the ones derived in the literature from other lfv processes and comment on the prospects of lhc searches related to the contact @xmath0 interactions . </S>"
