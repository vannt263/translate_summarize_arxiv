    "we show that , in the case of a finite  ranged repulsive pair potential , the square lattice is unstable for all values of the density . still in the nearest  neighbour approximation , we give a criterion determining the range of densities for which the hexagonal lattice is stable . in both cases ,",
    "we present numerical results which show that taking into account more rings of neighbours does not affect the qualitative behaviour of the system . applying our results to a two  dimensional system of ultracold composite bosons",
