    "early - type galaxies in clusters exhibit a linear color - magnitude ( cm ) relation indicating that bright galaxies are systematically redder than their faint cluster companions ( visvanathan & sandage 1977 ) .",
    "this remarkable relation shows very small scatter ( @xmath3 magnitude ) in high precision photometry of local clusters such as coma and virgo ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992a , 1992b , hereafter ble92 ) and can be extended to clusters at medium - to - high redshift ( @xmath4 ) ( ellis et al 1997 , stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) . a first attempt at explaining the universality of the cm relation involves using the age of each galaxy as the main determinant of its color .",
    "ageing stellar populations redden progressively as stars with decreasing initial mass evolve off the main sequence .",
    "therefore , if the colors of cluster galaxies are purely controlled by age , the small scatter about the cm relation implies a nearly synchronous star formation process for all galaxies of a given mass , while the slope of the cm relation implies systematically older ages for more massive galaxies .",
    "as shown most recently by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) , such a picture is highly unlikely because it does not preserve the slope nor the magnitude range of the cm relation in time .",
    "another important factor that affects the colors of stellar populations is metallicity . at fixed age",
    ", a more metal - rich stellar population will appear redder and fainter than a more metal - poor one ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) .",
    "hence , increasing metallicity at fixed age has a similar effect on colors as increasing age at fixed metallicity .",
    "this is usually referred to as the _ age - metallicity degeneracy _ ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "several studies have shown that cm relation of cluster elliptical galaxies could be primarily driven by metallicity effects ( larson 1974 ; matteuci & tornamb 1987 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism usually involved is that of a galactic wind : supernovae - driven winds are expected to be more efficient in ejecting enriched gas , and hence in preventing more metal - rich stars from forming , in low - mass galaxies than in massive galaxies with deeper potential wells .",
    "although age is generally assumed to be the same for all galaxies in these studies , this has not been proven to be an essential requirement .",
    "in fact , scenarios in which e / s0 galaxies progressively form by the merging of disk galaxies ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) in a universe where structure is built via hierarchical clustering also predict that the cm relation is driven primarily by metallicity effects ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 )",
    ". moreover , age effects could be important if , for example , there is sufficiently strong feedback from early galaxy formation to bias the luminous mass distribution of subsequent generations of galaxies by the heating of intergalactic gas .",
    "in this paper we present a new , more model - independent approach for evaluating the full range of ages and metallicities allowed by the spectro - photometric properties of early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "the method is based on the construction of age - metallicity diagrams constrained by the colors of early - type galaxies in the nearby coma cluster and in 17 clusters observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) at redshifts up to @xmath5 ( stanford et al .",
    "such an analysis has hitherto been hindered because of the lack of both accurate stellar libraries for different metallicities and reliable morphological information on cluster galaxies at medium - to - high redshifts .",
    "our results can subsequently be reframed into specific theories of galaxy formation , since they will be indispensable for any model that seeks to produce galaxies resembling those actually observed . in ",
    "2 we present the spectral evolution models used in this paper . the cluster sample is described in  3 . in ",
    "4 we construct the age - metallicity diagrams allowed by the observations , and in  5 we compute the corresponding ranges in mass - to - light ratio and in several commonly used spectral indices .",
    "we discuss our main conclusions in  6 .",
    "we compute the spectral evolution of early - type galaxies using the latest version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) models of stellar population synthesis .",
    "these span the range of metallicities @xmath6 and include all phases of stellar evolution , from the zero - age main sequence to supernova explosions for progenitors more massive than @xmath7 , or to the end of the white dwarf cooling sequence for less massive progenitors .",
    "in addition , the models predict the strengths of 21 stellar absorption features computed using the worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) analytic fitting functions for index strength as a function of stellar temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "this constitutes the standard `` lick / ids '' system that is often used as a basis for spectral diagnostics in early - type galaxies .",
    "the resulting model spectra computed for stellar populations of various ages and metallicities have been checked against observed spectra of star clusters and galaxies ( bruzual et al .",
    "1997 ; bruzual & charlot 1998 ) .    the uncertainties in the models are discussed in charlot , worthey & bressan ( 1996 ) .",
    "these can reach up to 0.05  mag in rest - frame @xmath8 , 0.25  mag in rest - frame @xmath9 and a 25% dispersion in the @xmath10-band mass - to - light ratio . with these uncertainties in mind",
    ", we will concentrate more on understanding the trends seen in the observations than on inferring absolute age and metallicity values .",
    "it is worth noting that the most massive elliptical galaxies exhibit [ mg / fe ] ratios in excess of that found in the most metal - rich stars in the solar neighborhood ( by @xmath11 dex ; see worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ) . while this may limit the accuracy of the predicted mg@xmath12 indices of bright elliptical galaxies , the recent models of bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) convincingly show that an enhancement in light elements at fixed total metallicity has virtually no effect on the other spectrophotometric properties of model stellar populations .",
    "we approximate model early - type galaxies by instantaneous - burst stellar populations .",
    "the reason for this is that we aim at constraining the age and metallicity ranges of stars dominating the light of early - type galaxies , whose photometric properties are well represented by instantaneous - burst populations .",
    "in fact , this is true even if the galaxies underwent subsequent small amounts of star formation or if the epoch of major star formation was extended over several billion years ( e.g. , fig .  1 of charlot & silk 1994 ) .",
    "the predicted colors of our models at fixed age and metallicity agree well with the results of more refined calculations including the effects of infall and galactic winds for corresponding values of the mean age and metallicity ( kodama & arimoto 1997 , bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ) .",
    "for example , adopting metallicities matching the luminosity  weighted metallicities @xmath13 in table  2 of kodama & arimoto yields @xmath14 and @xmath9 colors that agree to better than 0.05  mag with the results from these authors at an age of 15  gyr .",
    "such a discrepancy is well within the errors of current population synthesis models ( charlot et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the remainder of the present paper , the initial mass function ( imf ) is taken from scalo ( 1986 ) and is truncated at 0.1 and 100@xmath15 .",
    "we use the above models to compute the locations in the age ",
    "metallicity diagram of stellar populations satisfying specified spectro - photometric properties .",
    "figure  1 shows four such age ",
    "metallicity diagrams corresponding to imposed values of the @xmath14 and @xmath9 colors and mg@xmath16 and h@xmath17 spectral indices .",
    "these quantities are chosen here because they can be constrained by many observations of early - type galaxies (  3 and  5 ) . in each panel , the models satisfying the same value of the spectro - photometric property of interest are related by a continuous line , different lines corresponding to different imposed values . with this definition , the slope of a line in the age ",
    "metallicity diagrams indicates the relative sensitivity of the color or index under consideration to age and metallicity .",
    "vertical lines would correspond to a sensitivity purely to age , and horizontal lines to a sensitivity purely to metallicity .",
    "figure  1 then shows immediately that the @xmath14 and @xmath9 colors and mg@xmath16 index depend more strongly on metallicity than on age , while the h@xmath17 index depends more strongly on age than on metallicity .",
    "we will return to this point in  4 and  5 .",
    "the relative dependence of the spectro - photometric properties of instantaneous - burst populations on age and metallicity has been previously investigated by worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "he used the parameter @xmath18 at fixed color or index to represent the ratio of the change @xmath19 in age needed to counterbalance a change @xmath20 in metallicity in order to keep that color or index unchanged .",
    "the difference between worthey s and our approach is that he computed a single effective value of @xmath18 for each spectro - photometric property , while the different lines in figure  1 show the behavior of the @xmath18 slope for different values of the color or index under consideration . for comparison ,",
    "the arrow in each panel of figure  1 indicates the @xmath21 vector obtained by worthey ( 1994 ) . in each case",
    ", the general agreement with the mean slope of the lines is good .",
    "table  1 gives a more quantitative comparison between worthey s ( 1994 ) and our results .",
    "we computed linear fits to all lines in figure  1 and then a linear fit between the derived slopes and their corresponding color or index value .",
    "the slopes and zero points of these relations for each spectro - photometric property are listed in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table  1 .",
    "we then evaluated @xmath18 for four values of the @xmath14 and @xmath9 colors ( and corresponding model predictions for the mg@xmath16 and h@xmath17 indices ) matching the properties of early - type galaxies at four magnitudes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 along the local cm relation ( ble92 ; see  3 ) .",
    "the agreement with worthey s ( 1994 ) predictions is seen to be of the order of @xmath26 % .",
    "it is worth noting that our generalized fits deviate significantly from worthey s `` 3/2 rule '' which takes the @xmath27 ratio to be 1.5 for any color .",

    "1998 for a thorough analysis ) .",
    "furthermore , all clusters exhibit a tight cm relation with a slope showing no significant change out to @xmath5 .",
    "this has been taken as evidence that all galaxies shared a common history of star formation ( stanford et al .",
    "1998 ; kodama et al . 1998 ; but see kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "we note that there is an open question about the membership of some morphologically - selected early - type galaxies with faint magnitudes and colors far bluer than the cm relation in the clusters ( e.g. , kodama et al .",

    "( 1997 ) of three of the clusters in table  2 , f1557.19tc , cl  0016 + 16 and j1888.16cl .",
    "although these faint ( @xmath42 ) galaxies may be field contaminants , for completeness we should not abandon the possibility that they are blue cluster early - type galaxies that violate the cm relation .",
    "thus , they are also included in our analysis .",
    "it is worth pointing out that stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find no significant difference between the photometric properties of early - type galaxies in clusters of different richness or x - ray luminosity at a similar redshift .",
    "while this finding does not necessarily imply that all early - type galaxies were assembled early ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) , it strongly supports analyses like the one presented in  4 in which constraints on photometric evolution are drawn from comparisons of the properties of galaxies in clusters at different redshifts . also , to avoid any bias near the bright end of the cm relation , we have checked that the brightest cluster galaxies in the sample of table  2 match the @xmath37-band absolute luminosity versus redshift relation published by aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "finally , to tighten the models at @xmath43 , we use the cm relation derived by ble92 for e / s0 galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "this takes the forms @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with standard deviations of 0.055  mag and 0.065  mag in @xmath14 and @xmath9 colors , respectively . to define the absolute magnitude scale of the models , the recession velocity of the coma cluster",

    "we adopt @xmath48 km  sec@xmath47mpc@xmath47 and @xmath49 , except when otherwise indicated .",
    "the distance modulus to the coma cluster is therefore 35.41  mag .",
    "the small scatter of the cm relation at fixed luminosity has been used by ble92 to constrain the age range of early - type galaxies in clusters ( see also ellis et al .",
    "they computed the maximum spread in star - formation epoch allowed by the observed scatter in @xmath14 color according to the rate of color change @xmath50 predicted by population synthesis models .",
    "the basis of this argument can be understood from figure  2 .",
    "the top panel shows the @xmath14 color evolution of a stellar population in the time interval @xmath51 $ ] as a function of age @xmath52 for several metallicities , while the bottom panel shows the inferred @xmath50 evolution as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath50 decreases with model age @xmath52 , ble92 found that the older the galaxies , the larger the allowed spread in star - formation epoch .",
    "on the basis of this analysis , ble92 favored a major star - formation epoch at @xmath53 for early - type galaxies in clusters , spread over a period of roughly 1  gyr .",
    "it is crucial to realize that ble92 s argument utilizing @xmath50 is based on the _ a priori _ requirement that at fixed luminosity , all early - type galaxies in the cm relation have the same metallicity .",
    "in fact , the analysis was conducted using population synthesis models for uniquely solar metallicity .",
    "as the present paper demonstrates , however , at fixed luminosity the photometric constraints on cluster galaxies allow a wide range of ages and metallicities (  4 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath54 argument already includes restrictive hypotheses on the ages and metallicities of early - type galaxies with respect to the full allowed ranges .",

    "the lower panel of figure  4 shows that the alternative cosmology @xmath84 km  sec@xmath47mpc@xmath47 and @xmath85 would lead on average to slightly larger @xmath68 values for model galaxies because of the lower age of the universe implied at redshift 1 .",

    "3_a _ shows , constraints on clusters at lower redshifts are consistent with formation redshifts as small as 0.6 for even the brightest , reddest galaxies .",
    "hence , the apparent lack of evolution of the slope and scatter of the cm relation in clusters does not imply by itself a common epoch of star formation for all early - type galaxies .",
    "instead , what is strictly implied is that new galaxies joining the cm relation at low redshifts must be more metal - rich than their older cluster companions of similar luminosity . the required age ",

    "depend sensitively on the assumed low - mass end of the imf , we adopt for all clusters the arbitrary normalization @xmath92 at @xmath93 and focus our investigation on the dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on luminosity .",
    "the mean values of @xmath94 computed in this way are shown as triangles in figure  5 . since the mass - to-@xmath10 light ratio of a stellar population increases at increasing age and metallicity , brighter galaxies in figure  5 generally tend to have larger @xmath94 than fainter galaxies .",
    "this is not always true , however , as can be understood from the dispersion in the results of figure  3 .",
    "also shown in figure  5 are the results from two recent observational studies of the fundamental plane for cluster e / s0 galaxies .",

    "they conclude that the half ",
    "light radius has a negligible effect on determinations of @xmath96 and show that the data follow the simple relation @xmath97 with a scatter of only 25% .",
    "the central velocity dispersion @xmath38 is tightly correlated with luminosity via the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "we use ble92 s calibration of this relation based on observations of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster in order to relate @xmath98 to @xmath99 in figure  5 .",
    "we then adopt the mean @xmath100 colors of galaxies along the cm relation to convert jrgensen et al.s ( 1996 ) result into an expression involving the mass - to-@xmath10 luminosity ratio .",
    "this yields @xmath101 , corresponding to an increase of less than 3% in logarithmic slope with respect to the relation derived in gunn  @xmath95 .",
    "the horizontal shading in figure  5 then indicates the range of slopes allowed after accounting for the scatter of jrgensen et al.s ( 1996 ) data around the mean relation .",
    "an alternative constraint on the observed range of mass - to-@xmath10 luminosity ratios can be obtained from the relation recently derived by graham & colless ( 1997 ) between half  light radius , central velocity dispersion and mean surface brightness of early - type galaxies .",
    "their analysis is based on accurate fitting of the @xmath10-light profiles of 26 e / s0 galaxies in the virgo cluster using both homologous ( @xmath102 ) and non - homologous ( @xmath103 , with @xmath104 a free parameter ) radial dependence laws .",
    "the results indicate a slight but systematic breaking of the generally assumed homology in the sense that @xmath104 increases with increasing half - light radius .",
    "we can use the virial theorem and faber - jackson relation to reexpress the results of graham & colless ( 1997 ) in terms of a relation involving @xmath91 and @xmath98 .",
    "the outcome is shown in the upper and lower panels of figure  5 for non - homologous and homologous light profiles , respectively . in each case",
    ", the heavy solid line indicates the mean relation and the slanted shading represents the allowed range of slopes when the uncertainties quoted by graham & colless are included .",
    "figure  5 shows that the mass - to - light ratios of model galaxies are all within the range constrained by current observations .",
    "the models appear to be mostly compatible with the graham & colless ( 1997 ) results for non - homologous light profiles .",
    "however , we point out that the model values correspond to purely stellar mass - to - light ratios , whereas there is some observational evidence for the presence of dark halos around early - type galaxies .",
    "this is inferred via the studies of hi kinematics ( e.g. franx et al .",
    "1994 ) , x - ray emission ( e.g. forman et al .",
    "1994 ) , radial velocities of planetary nebulae and globular clusters ( e.g. mould et al .",
    "1990 , hui et al .",
    "1995 ) , gravitational lensing ( e.g. maoz & rix 1993 ) and measurements of the shape of the stellar line - of sight velocity distribution ( e.g. carollo et al . 1995 ) . more recently , rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have analyzed the velocity profile of the elliptical galaxy ngc  2434 and show that roughly half the mass within an effective radius is dark .",
    "hence , one must remain cautious in interpreting trends in the mass - to - light ratios of early - type galaxies on the basis of pure population synthesis models .      for completeness",
    ", we also compute the strengths of several commonly used spectral indices implied by the above photometric study for early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "most observations in this domain have concentrated on measurements of h - balmer , magnesium and iron - dominated indices of the lick system (  2 ) such as h@xmath17 , mg@xmath12 , mg@xmath16 and mgfe ( worthey et al . 1992 ; bender , burstein & faber 1993 ; gonzalez 1993 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ; ziegler & bender 1997 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations for studies of this type is to identify a pair of indices including one mostly sensitive to age and one mostly sensitive to metallicity in order to break the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy from photometric colors .",
    "sensitive h@xmath17 index , however , can be significantly contaminated by nuclear emission in e / s0 galaxies , for which the corrections are uncertain ( e.g. , gonzalez 1993 ) .",
    "it is therefore deemed preferable to study higher - order balmer indices such as h@xmath105 ( e.g. , worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) . also , the apparent systematic increase of [ mg / fe ] from faint to bright e / s0 galaxies challenges analyses based on models with solar - scaled abundance ratios ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "1992 ; tantalo , bressan & chiosi 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "worthey ( 1995 ) shows that the metal - sensitive index c4668 of the lick system appears to be significantly less enhanced with respect to iron than mg in bright e / s0 galaxies .",
    "thus , c4668 represents a good alternative to mg - dominated indices for reliable model investigations of early - type galaxy spectra ( e.g. , kuntschner & davies 1998 ) .    by analogy with our approach in  5.1 ,",
    "we compute mean spectral indices for each of the four luminosity bins in each cluster of our sample .",
    "the results are shown in figure  6 for the mg@xmath12 , h@xmath17 , mg@xmath16 , mgfe , c4668 and h@xmath106 indices of the lick system .",
    "as expected , there is a general correlation between index strength and luminosity , which is more pronounced for metal - sensitive ( mg@xmath12 , mg@xmath16 , mgfe and c4668 ) than for age - sensitive ( h@xmath17 , h@xmath106 ) indices .",
    "the reason for this is that luminous galaxies in figure  3 are on average found to be significantly more metal - rich and slightly older than faint galaxies .",
    "also , figure  1 shows that the sensitivity to age of h - balmer indices such as h@xmath17 is significantly weakened after @xmath107  gyr , when a and b stars have evolved off the main sequence . for comparison , the solid and dashed lines in figure  6 show the locations of passively evolving model galaxies with @xmath108 and the metallicities @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the mean index strengths of cluster galaxies appear to evolve roughly along these lines , supporting the consistency of the stellar populations with apparently passive evolution .",
    "in fact , ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) find that the evolution from @xmath43 to @xmath111 of the correlation existing between the mg@xmath16 index strength and central velocity dispersion of e / s0 galaxies is consistent with passive evolution .",
    "it should be noted that the model indices computed in figure  6 are global indices averaged over the emission from all stars in a galaxy .",
    "observations of nearby e / s0 galaxies , however , reveal systematic variations of the strengths of spectral indices between the central and outer regions ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "we have shown that the tight photometric constraints on early - type galaxies in clusters allow relatively wide ranges of ages and metallicities for the dominant stellar populations .",
    "in particular , the small scatter of the cm relation out to redshifts @xmath2 does not necessarily imply a common epoch of star formation for all early - type galaxies .",
    "it requires , however , that galaxies assembling more recently be on average more metal - rich than older galaxies of similar luminosity . in this context",
    "it is interesting to mention that , based on the spectral indices of nearby e / s0 galaxies , worthey , trager & faber ( 1996 ) favor younger ages for more metal - rich galaxies than for metal - poor ones at fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "the results of our unbiased analysis therefore define the boundaries in age and metallicity that must be satisfied by theoretical studies aimed at explaining the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies in clusters .    the constraints obtained here on the age and metallicity ranges of e / s0 galaxies are consistent with conventional models in which the galaxies all form monolithically in a single giant burst of star formation at high redshift ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , this implies that regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early - type galaxies within the allowed range , their photometric properties will always be consistent with _ apparently _ passive evolution of the stellar populations .",
    "as figure  6 shows , this consistency even extends to spectral index strengths .",
    "our results are also consistent with scenarios in which e / s0 galaxies are formed by the merging of disk galaxies ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) in a universe where structure is built through hierarchical clustering ( kauffmann 1996 ; baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . for such scenarios ,",
    "figure  3 constrains the metallicity and epoch of the last major event of star formation in e / s0 galaxies and their progenitors ( see  2 and  4 ) . the ages and metallicities of cluster e / s0 galaxies predicted by hierarchical models are found to be consistent with these constraints ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .    to better assess the origin of e / s0 galaxies in clusters one therefore needs to appeal to observational constraints other than their spectro - photometric properties .",
    "for example , conventional models of e / s0 galaxy formation are being challenged by the paucity of red galaxies found at high redshifts in deep surveys ( kauffmann , charlot , & white 1997 ; zepf 1997 ) . also , morphological distinction between e and s0 galaxies and the evolution of the morphology - density relation out to moderate redshifts appear to point to different formation epochs for e and s0 galaxies ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the tightness of the cm relation is proof of a stable process in the assembly of cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "however , as we move towards greater redshifts , a drastic change is expected at lookback times that approach the formation of the first e / s0 galaxies .",
    "this change can arise as a systematic blueing , an increased scatter or a slope flattening in the cm relation ( e.g. , aragn - salamanca et al . 1993 ; charlot & silk 1994 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "an interesting question is raised by the presence of morphologically - selected early - type galaxies with very blue colors in clusters at moderate redshifts (  3 and  4 ) .",
    "if these objects are true cluster members , our analysis shows that they could be young metal - poor galaxies that will later join the cm relation .",
    "hence , we need to probe deeper down the galaxy luminosity function in distant clusters in order to assess whether these objects can have any fundamental bearing on the origin of early - type galaxies .",
