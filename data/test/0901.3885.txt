    "supersymmetry serves as the most promising extension of the standard model . in the short future supersymmetry",
    "will be verified experimentally through the lhc experiments .",
    "the elegance of the theory and the simplifications that introduces is of great importance however supersymmetry must be broken in our four dimensional world .",
    "there exist various mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking . in this article",
    "we are interested in dynamical breaking of supersymmetry induced from a toroidal compact dimension .",
    "theories with one toroidal compact dimension resemble ( mathematically ) field theories at finite temperature .",
    "it is known that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at finite temperature @xcite , a fact that is closely related to the boundary conditions that fermions and bosons obey in the  thermal  compact dimension .",
    "specifically supersymmetry is spontaneously broken due to the periodicity of bosonic degrees of freedom and anti - periodicity of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "field theories at finite temperature are conceptually related to field theories with compact dimensions .",
    "thus it is easily understood that the boundary conditions of the fields in the compact dimensions control the breaking of supersymmetry . in general , when studying supersymmetric theories in flat spacetime , the background metric is ordinary minkowski .",
    "spacetime topology affect the boundary conditions of the fields that are integrated in the path integral .",
    "given a class of metrics , several spacetime topologies are allowed .  here we shall focus on a model that has @xmath3 topology underlying the spacetime , @xmath4 refers to a spatial dimension .",
    "the specific topology is a homogeneous topology of the flat clifford ",
    "klein type @xcite .",
    "non trivial topology , implies non trivial field configurations , that enter dynamically in the action .",
    "this non triviality enters in the action through the boundary conditions and as is well known the boundary conditions are controlled from the topology .",
    "the effective potential is a strong order parameter indicating when supersymmetry is broken .",
    "the appearance in the effective potential of vacuum terms which have different coefficients for fermions and bosons lead to the fact that the effective potential of the theory has no longer its minimum at zero and thus , supersymmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this quite general phenomenon can only be avoided in field theories with compact spatial dimensions , if in some way these vacuum terms are cancelled @xcite .",
    "indeed the combination of the allowed boundary conditions , as we show later , can save spontaneous supersymmetry breaking at finite volume .",
    "particularly this is due to the fact that we can have periodic fermions and anti - periodic bosons .",
    "this can not be avoided at finite temperature due to the restricted boundary conditions as we already mentioned , except in cases where fermions have a complex chemical potential @xcite as in pure @xmath5 yang mills theories with adjoint fermions at finite temperature @xcite , namely , @xmath6 normally a question arises while following the above considerations .",
    "why should someone care in avoiding spontaneous supersymmetry breaking at finite volume ?",
    "this is because when supersymmetry spontaneously breaks ( like at finite temperature ) then supersymmetry ceases to be a controllable symmetry of the theory , since it is always broken and not dynamically , but by definition .",
    "one would like to have control on the way that supersymmetry breaks ( especially in our case that the model spacetime we work is 4 dimensional and supersymmetry must be a symmetry and be broken dynamically .",
    "this can be avoided in theories with higher dimensions where supersymmetry can hold in the higher dimensional space and break in our world ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall study a 4 dimensional n=1 supersymmetric model at one loop , in topology @xmath3 .",
    "we shall find the allowed field configurations that are determined from the topology and construct in a correct way the lagrangian .",
    "the calculation of the effective potential follows , through which we shall find when supersymmetry breaks and when does not .",
    "after that we shall add in the lagrangian non holomorphic and hard supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "this terms break supersymmetry hardly .",
    "however for some values of the couplings and of the masses , interesting phenomena occur .",
    "particularly it is found that in some cases when the volume of the compact space is small supersymmetry is not broken and when the compact radius exceeds a critical value , supersymmetry breaks dynamically .",
    "we shall give a cosmological implication of this case which resembles first order cosmological phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "also other terms have a curious but worthy of mentioning effect . for these terms",
    "another strange phenomenon occurs for specific values of the couplings and masses . in detail for large values of the circumference of the compact dimension",
    ", supersymmetry is unbroken in contrast to the previous case and breaks after a critical length , as the compact dimension magnitude decreases .",
    "although this is not so interesting from a phenomenological point of view ( in four spacetime dimensions ) , it worths mentioning ( and may have application in the physics of extra dimensions ) .",
    "there exist similar works in the literature but with the difference that the symmetry under study is not supersymmetry but a global symmetry ( continuous or discrete ) . at finite temperature in some cases broken @xmath7",
    "symmetries become restored at high temperatures .",
    "also unbroken symmetries at small temperatures may break at high temperatures ( a phenomenon known as inverse symmetry breaking ) .",
    "the last may have cosmological implications . in our case",
    "the same occurs but with supersymmetry in place of the symmetry and for a compact dimension playing the temperature s role ( also note that roughly the high temperature limit is closely related to the small length limit through the transformation @xmath8 . actually through the last transformation we can relate the two limits where this is possible ) .",
    "one interesting feature of this resemblance is the similarity of the terms in the lagrangian that trigger these phenomena in both cases .",
    "also these terms appear in the new inflationary models and help in the procedure of reheating the universe after inflation . we shall present and describe everything in detail in the forthcoming sections .",
    "also let us mention that our calculations will be in 1-loop level and within the perturbative limits with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the largest mass scale in the theory and @xmath11 is the circumference of the compact dimension . also within the four dimensional setup",
    "we use , renormalizability of masses and couplings is ensured when @xmath12 .    in section 1",
    "we review the mathematical setup needed for field theories with non trivial topology .",
    "the resemblance with extra dimensional theories is pointed out . in section 2",
    "we describe the n=1 supersymmetric model we shall use and calculate the effective potential in the case of the compact dimension having infinite length and after that at finite volume . in section 3 we add several supersymmetry breaking terms and study in detail their effect on the vacuum energy of the model . in section 4",
    "we review the continuous symmetry restoration , symmetry non - restoration and inverse symmetry breaking at finite temperature and point out the resemblance of these with our case ( a resemblance that stems from the interactions of the scalar sector ) . in section 5",
    "we present a cosmological application of one of our results and in section 6 a short discussion with the conclusions follow .",
    "the existence of non trivial field configurations ( in terms of boundary conditions ) due to non trivial topology ( twisted fields ) , was first pointed out by isham @xcite and then adopted by other authors @xcite .  in the spacetime of our case , the topological properties of @xmath13 are classified by the first stieffel class @xmath14 which is isomorphic to the singular ( simplicial ) cohomology group @xmath15 because of the triviality of the @xmath16 sheaf .",
    "it is known that @xmath17 classifies the twisting of a bundle .",
    "specifically , it describes and classifies the orientability of a bundle globally . in our case ,",
    "the classification group is @xmath18 and , we have two locally equivalent bundles , which are however different globally _",
    "i.e. _  cylinder - like and moebius strip - like .",
    "the mathematical lying behind , is to find the sections that correspond to these two bundles , classified completely by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the sections we shall consider are real scalar fields and majorana spinor fields which carry a topological number called moebiosity ( twist ) , which distinguishes between twisted and untwisted fields .",
    "the twisted fields obey anti - periodic boundary conditions , while untwisted fields periodic in the compactified dimension .",
    "usually ( inspired by field theory at finite temperature ) one takes scalar fields to obey periodic and fermion fields anti - periodic boundary conditions , disregarding all other configurations that may arise from non trivial topology .",
    "we shall consider all these configurations .",
    "let @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 denote the untwisted and twisted scalar and twisted and untwisted spinor fields respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath24 dimension are , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for scalar fields and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for fermion fields , where @xmath29 stands for the remaining two spatial and one time dimension which are not affected by the boundary conditions . spinors ( both dirac and majorana ) , still remain grassmann quantities .",
    "we assign the untwisted fields twist @xmath30 ( the trivial element of @xmath31 and the twisted fields twist @xmath32 ( the non trivial element of @xmath18 ) .",
    "recall that @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we require the lagrangian to be scalar under @xmath19 thus to have @xmath30 moebiosity .",
    "the topological charges flowing at the interaction vertices must sum to @xmath30 under @xmath39 . for supersymmetric models ,",
    "supersymmetry transformations impose some restrictions on the twist assignments of the superfield component fields @xcite .    now which fields can acquire vacuum expectation value ?",
    "grassmann fields can not acquire vacuum expectation value ( vev ) since we require the vacuum value to be a scalar representation of the lorentz group .",
    "thus , the question is focused on the two scalars .",
    "the twisted scalar can not acquire non zero vev @xcite , consequently , only untwisted scalars are allowed to develop vev s .    in the literature ,",
    "twisted fields have frequently been used , for example in the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite , where the harmonic expansion of the fields is of the form : @xmath40 the  @xmath10  parameter incorporates the twist mentioned above .",
    "this treatment is closely related to automorphic field theory @xcite in more than 4 dimensions ( which is an alternative to the one used by us ) .",
    "the scherk - schwarz mechanism is a well known mechanism that generates supersymmetry breaking to our 4 dimensional world after dimensional reduction and is frequently used for compactifications in extra dimensional models .",
    "concerning the automorphic field theory , let us quote here a different approach to the above .",
    "due to the compact dimension we can use generic boundary conditions for bosons and fermions in the compact dimension .",

    "@xmath53is a left chiral superfield .",
    "it contains the untwisted scalar field components and the untwisted weyl fermion .",
    "although the untwisted scalar is complex , we shall use the real components which will be the representatives of the sections of the trivial bundle classified by @xmath54 .",
    "moreover,@xmath55is another left chiral superfield containing the twisted scalar field and the twisted weyl fermion .",
    "writing down ( [ lagra ] ) in component form , we get ( writing weyl fermions in the majorana representation):@xmath56notice that moebiosity is conserved at all interaction vertices _",
    "i.e. _  equals @xmath30 .",
    "the moebiosity of  @xmath20 and @xmath57 is @xmath30 while for @xmath58  and  @xmath59 is @xmath60 . using the @xmath18 cyclic group properties we see that the lagrangian ( [ test ] ) has moebiosity @xmath30.the complex field @xmath20 can be written in terms of real components as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the classical value ) .",

    "also for @xmath168 the @xmath169 dependence is similar to that of figure [ fitl3lc ] . particularly the @xmath169 dependence in this case , is described by , @xmath170 which is the same as before .",
    "this dependence is the same for all the cases we studied .",
    "thus this motivates us to think that there is a universal behavior of @xmath152 as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "of course all effects we described in this section appear in one loop level and within perturbative limits .",
    "thus there exist the danger that all these effects are an artifact of perturbation theory .",
    "however the theory is at some level supersymmetric and one loop corrections may be adequate enough @xcite . a detailed study should include higher loop corrections . in the next section similar problems - considerations",
    "are encountered and discussed .",
    "in this section we review some conceptually similar phenomena to the above .",
    "the difference is that symmetries are studied at finite temperature and the symmetry is not supersymmetry but a continuous global @xmath171 or a discrete @xmath172 . as we shall see",
    "symmetry non - restoration and inverse symmetry breaking phenomena occur naturally when similar terms to @xmath173 , @xmath174 appear in the lagrangian .",
    "symmetry non - restoration means that a symmetry broken at @xmath175 never gets restored at high temperatures .",
    "inverse symmetry breaking means that an unbroken symmetry at @xmath175 may be spontaneously broken at high temperature .",
    "these phenomena occur in field theories when cross interactions are included among the scalar fields similar to the bosonic hard supersymmetry breaking term @xmath129 .",
    "similar to this term scalar interactions and also yukawa terms like the ones of the previous sections are frequently used in the theory of reheating after inflation .",
    "actually this similarities motivated us to use such terms in order to see what their effect would be on supersymmetry breaking",
    ". we shall discuss these in the end of this section .",
    "first let us describe the inverse symmetry breaking phenomenon .",
    "consider a theory with real scalar fields @xmath176 and @xmath177 described by the @xmath171 globally symmetric lagrangian , @xmath178 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 be real scalars with @xmath179 and @xmath180 components . in the above lagrangian one of the global @xmath181 symmetries may break at high temperature if the @xmath182 coupling takes negative values .",
    "thus one of the two scalar fields @xmath176 or @xmath177 may acquire a non zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "thus at high temperature and for certain values of the parameters , the initial @xmath171 is broken to @xmath183 .",
    "this was called inverse symmetry breaking and was first point out by weinberg @xcite and extensively studied by many authors @xcite .    in the case @xmath184 and @xmath185 the initial @xmath171 symmetry reduces to a @xmath172 symmetry and similar arguments hold , in connection to the breaking of one of the two discrete symmetries ( for details see @xcite )    symmetry non - restoration was used in @xcite to solve the monopole problem in the @xmath186 gut .",
    "monopoles are usually produced during phase transitions at temperatures of the order @xmath187gev . as was proposed in @xcite , the symmetric phase of @xmath186 was never realized ,",
    "no matter how high the temperature becomes . in that paper",
    "the interaction term @xmath188 appearing in the scalar kibble - higgs sector is responsible for the non - restoration of the @xmath186 symmetry .",
    "actually the scalar interaction of @xmath189 and @xmath190 gives negative contributions to the thermal masses and one of those becomes negative .",
    "once this happens the corresponding higgs field maintains a vacuum expectation value for high temperatures and the symmetry is never restored .",
    "this phenomenon occurs for certain values of the parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however these results are very sensitive and are altered when someone includes two loop calculations @xcite . in the same spirit",
    "there are arguments based on large n calculations which can show that symmetry non - restoration is an artifact of perturbation theory . for an interesting discussion on this see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a cross term of the form @xmath191 is used in non relativistic models in condensed matter physics , for example in the coupled two field bose gases . however the effect of this does not break any of the initial symmetry patterns @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "the intuitive approach to all phenomena at finite temperature consists of the statement that symmetries broken at small temperatures become restored at high temperature ( in the same class belong finite volume theories ) .",
    "many field theory models exist that belong to this class .",
    "counter intuitive phenomena occur in field theories with rich scalar sector . especially if the multi - scalar sectors interact weakly with negative couplings then the phenomena known as inverse symmetry breaking or symmetry non - restoration occur .",
    "this happens at high temperature and refers to the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry at high temperature .",
    "usually the symmetry is a global @xmath171 or for the case of symmetry non - restoration a continuous , like @xmath186 .",
    "although inverse symmetry breaking is counterintuitive , nature has provided us with examples that systems are more symmetric at low temperatures than at high temperature .",
    "for example the rochelle salt which at low temperatures is orthorhombic and after a critical temperature becomes monoclinic .",
    "similar phenomena occur in liquid crystals ( for more examples see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the process of reheating after inflation is one of the most important features of the new inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "the process of reheating is necessary in order that the inflating vacuum like state of the universe transforms to a hot friedmann universe state . during the reheating process a massive scalar field",
    "gives it s vacuum energy to lighter fermions and bosons .",
    "the lagrangian governing this process is , @xmath192 the role of the inflaton fields is played from the scalar field @xmath193 .",
    "the inflaton field decays to the particles @xmath194 and @xmath165 due to the interaction terms @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "note that we used similar terms in order to break supersymmetry hard and all the effects we seen in the previous section are due to these interaction terms .",
    "also , in order reheating takes place , the condition @xmath197 must hold ( remember that similar conditions hold in the supersymmetric model we studied previously . there @xmath198 was the tree order mass of the untwisted scalar field and @xmath10 the tree order mass of the twisted scalar .",
    "one of the conditions we used is that the untwisted sector has greater mass than the twisted sector , namely @xmath199 .",
    "also the untwisted fermion has mass m ) .",
    "so with the interactions @xmath200 and @xmath196 the initially concentrated energy ( during inflation ) to the field @xmath193 is transferred to particle creation through the processes @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and the universe thermalizes @xcite .    the cross interaction terms of the form @xmath203 are used in some versions of hybrid inflation .",
    "let us briefly mention another application of cross interactions between scalar fields .",
    "these terms are used to the thermal inflation scenario .",
    "this is a modified version of the new inflation and old inflation scenario @xcite . in the thermal inflation scenario , a lagrangian that contains a term @xmath203",
    "this term is necessary in order a phase transition takes place .",
    "actually there is bump in the effective potential that is solely created from this interaction term and the phase transition is strongly first order .",
    "the universe supercools in the false vacuum and after a critical temperature tunnels to the true vacuum through bubble nucleation . at this point",
    "thermal inflation ends ( for details see @xcite ) .    before closing this section",
    "we conclude that cross terms between scalar fields and yukawa interactions are frequently used in particle models and these terms make the effective potential locally unstable thus triggering first order phase transitions , reheating and other processes . also at high temperatures and for specific values of the parameters , these terms may cause inverse symmetry breaking or symmetry non restoration .    our study involved these terms but the phenomena studied where related to supersymmetry breaking and inverse supersymmetry breaking when the space has a compact dimension .",
    "so the resemblance between the two setups is quite clear .",
    "we shall discuss on this later on .",
    "in this section a brief qualitative application ( although fictitious ) of one of the above results is presented . consider a toy universe that has just come out of it s strong gravity period and it s particle content ( matter ) is described by ( [ test ] ) with the addition of the hard supersymmetry breaking term @xmath204 .",
    "the back - reaction of gravity on field theory is considered small ( _ i.e._field theory calculations made in the previous part considering flat background , are consistent and thus the metric fluctuations are negligible ) .",
    "this toy universe s expansion is described by : @xmath205 a homogeneous clifford - klein metric ( known as bianchi i cosmological model ) , with @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , as in ( [ flat ] ) . in ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , describe the scale factors of the two infinite and of the compact dimension respectively . also we assume , @xmath212 with @xmath213 .",
    "figure [ nonsusy ] motivates us to think as follows : at small lengths of the compact dimension the toy universe s ground state is the supersymmetric vacuum although we had broken supersymmetry using a hard term , something usually unexpected .",
    "as the circumference of the compact dimension grows , the toy universe  acknowledges  the presence of the other true vacuum ( in terms of it s quantum one loop effective potential ) and at some point ( bubbles of the new vacuum create within the false vacuum ) quantum penetrates to the other vacuum , the non supersymmetric one .",
    "therefore , at small lengths of the compact dimension , supersymmetry was unbroken and as the radius grows , supersymmetry breaks .",
    "it seems that using a compact dimension in the present model , supersymmetry breaks dynamically after some critical radius of the compact dimension , although supersymmetry is expected to be broken for all lengths ( this would exactly be the effect of a hard supersymmetry breaking term ) .",
    "let us now do some toy cosmology on this toy universe .",
    "@xmath214 is the minimum of the effective potential at the origin ( note @xmath127 ) , and @xmath215 the minimum after quantum barrier penetration ( the non supersymmetric vacuum ) .",
    "we assume this toy universe has a cosmological constant which is chosen to be @xmath216 ( a choice which shall be explained below ) .",
    "note that @xmath217 .",
    "the friedmann equation describing it s evolution is : @xmath218 referred to the @xmath219 dimension ( we omit the analysis on the other dimension and to the compact one since it is similar ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "for details see @xcite ) .    in the early post quantum gravity period",
    ", this toy universe is at the @xmath214 vacuum state , the energy density is @xmath220 .",
    "the friedmann equation reads : @xmath221 and without getting into much detail ( see @xcite ) , an inflationary solution ( corresponding to a flat universe ) follows in all space dimensions , being of the form , @xmath222 with @xmath223 . note that the rate of the expansion is the same for all dimensions . during the inflation period of this toy universe ,",
    "its quantum vacuum state is the supersymmetric vacuum ( false vacuum ) , until for some length quantum tunnelling occurs ( due to one loop quantum effects ) , and the new vacuum state is @xmath215 , the new minimum of the effective action . during the quantum vacuum penetration ,",
    "the energy release ( something like latent heat ) @xcite is of the order @xmath224 which thermalizes the matter content at a temperature @xmath225 , with @xmath226 @xmath227 and @xmath225 characterizing the  phase transition  point .",
    "after thermalization , the energy density is @xmath228 and the friedmann equation reads : @xmath229 ( we fixed @xmath230 in order to cancel the value of @xmath215 ) .",
    "so after vacuum penetration the toy universe follows a radiation dominated expansion ( note that the maximum temperature ever reached was the thermalization temperature @xmath225 @xcite ) .",
    "note that the above picture has many similarities with the strongly supercooled first order phase transitions of the early universe ( old inflationary scenario ) .",
    "let us point out its main features . start with a toy universe filled with fermions and bosons interacting in a non supersymmetric way ( due to explicit hard breaking ) .",
    "the toy universe is at a supersymmetric vacuum ( unexpectedly ) when it s magnitude ( specifically the compact dimension magnitude ) is small , but as it evolves spatially ( inflation in our setup ) quantum penetrates to a non supersymmetric vacuum , which is energetically preferable .",
    "so at the early toy universe s epoch , supersymmetry was not broken ( at least the vacuum quantum state did not realize broken susy ) , although the matter content of it , interacts in a non supersymmetric way , but supersymmetry dynamically breaks ( through quantum tunnelling ) @xcite when the toy universe evolves at larger sizes .",
    "let us note here that in order this toy universe is realistic , one must deal with defects ( monopoles , domain walls ) and with the cosmological experimental observations that do not suggest non trivial topology in the spatial dimensions .",
    "maybe domain walls may be avoided in first order phase transitions but if we want to include guts in this universe we can not avoid defects ( only if the temperature after the quantum penetration is smaller compared to the temperature that the defects are created , then defects maybe be avoided ) .",
    "even if one deals with defects , the non trivial topology problem remains , so the magnitude of the compact dimension must be larger than the particle horizon ( which can be achieved during inflation ) .",
    "in this paper we studied a simple supersymmetric model in @xmath2 spacetime topology .",
    "we discussed how topology can affect the boundary conditions of the fields and we seen that in @xmath2 bosons and fermions can have periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions along the compact dimension .",
    "also we discussed how supersymmetry is broken spontaneously and how this can be avoided in terms of the boundary conditions that the fields obey .",
    "we confirmed these by calculating the effective potential of the theory .",
    "* when an interaction among the two untwisted scalars is added , a term of the form @xmath129 , supersymmetry remains unbroken for small values of the radius of the compact dimension , and as the length increases , breaks after a critical length .",
    "this occurs when @xmath155 .",
    "this phenomenon resembles first order phase transitions of finite temperature field theories .",
    "also we applied this to a toy cosmological model , which described the evolution of a universe with an initial cosmological constant and filled with the aforementioned fields .",
    "* the addition of an interaction among the scalar of the untwisted sector that develops a vev and the twisted scalars or the twisted fermions results in a very peculiar phenomenon . particularly when certain conditions hold ( similar to the aforementioned ) supersymmetry is broken for small lengths and as the radius increases , becomes restored after a critical length .",
    "this resembles conceptually second order phase transitions .",
    "the last is similar to inverse symmetry breaking phenomena at finite temperature , that appear in field theories with rich scalar sector . in that case",
    "a symmetry unbroken at low temperatures may break at high temperature . in our case at small lengths supersymmetry breaks while remains unbroken for large radius values .",
    "we called this inverse supersymmetry breaking for brevity .",
    "the terms in the lagrangian that trigger inverse symmetry breaking are the same that trigger inverse supersymmetry breaking .",
    "also these terms appear in the theory of reheating and in the thermal inflation . in the study we realized that there is a universality in the @xmath169 dependence .",
    "we shall present these in detail in @xcite .    finally let us discuss the physical significance of  inverse supersymmetry breaking  .",
    "this phenomenon is not so appealing to a four dimensional theory .",
    "what would be expected is that supersymmetry should be unbroken for small values of the radius of the compact dimension and breaks dynamically at large distances .",
    "what happens here is the converse . for large values of the radius",
    ", supersymmetry is unbroken and breaks dynamically for small values of the radius .",
    "however this would be interesting for a five dimensional model .",
    "imagine a theory where supersymmetry is unbroken for large radius of the compact dimension and breaks dynamically for small values of the compact dimension .",
    "it is an interesting task to find what this mechanism ( which is basically coupling interplay between interactions ) has to say for the radius stabilization mechanism of extra dimensional models .",
