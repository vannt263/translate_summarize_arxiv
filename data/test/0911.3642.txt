    "the study of accretion processes is of fundamental astrophysical importance , being ubiquitous on both the largest and smallest scales , i.e. ranging from accretion by supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies at one end to star and planet formation at the other .",
    "here we are interested in studying accretion phenomena in the presence of a large gravitational potential such as that observed in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in these sources ,",
    "the fundamental timescales of interest , governing the accretion process , scale with the mass of the central object ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "hence , studies of the galactic xrb population provide an excellent laboratory for detailed examination of the process of accretion on humanly accessible timescales .    the very - high , high - soft and low - hard states ( hereafter vhs , hss & lhs ) are the primary active accretion states observed in xrbs ( see the review by @xcite for a detailed description of accretion states in black hole binaries ) . despite being the most common mode of accretion in black hole x - ray binaries ,",
    "the nature of the accretion flow in the low - hard state remains uncertain .",
    "emission in the lhs is characterized by a hard power - law spectrum ( @xmath0 1.4  1.7 ) and strong x - ray variability ( 30%  40% rms ) .",
    "correlated variability at radio / nir / optical wavelengths has also been observed from the black hole systems while in the hard state @xcite .",
    "the hard power - law component may be the result of comptonization by a hot optically thin plasma of soft seed photons from a thermal disc or magnetic structures ( through cyclo - synchrotron processes - see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the geometry of this plasma is not well understood .",
    "a popular model for the accretion geometry in the low - hard state was given by @xcite .",
    "in that model the standard thin accretion disc , that dominates in the spectrally soft states is radially truncated and replaced by an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf : see @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental assumption of a radially recessed accretion disc may find some support in the low disc reflection fractions which are sometimes measured in the hard state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of models have been developed which do not require a recessed disc in the low - hard state .",
    "@xcite proposed that black hole states are driven by the height and bulk velocity of magnetic flares above a disc , which remains at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "these flares would serve to feed a mildly relativistically outflowing corona .",
    "low disc reflection fractions do not signal a recessed disc in this model , but result from mild beaming of the hard x - ray flux away from the disc .",
    "a similar model for the lhs , based on magnetically dominated coronae , has been proposed by @xcite . these outflowing coronae share some properties with jet based models for the hard component @xcite , in the sense that the latter also produce low reflection fractions @xcite without the need for a recessed accretion disc .",
    "a number of recent observations call into question the assumption of a recessed disc in the lhs .",
    "in particular gx 339 - 4 was observed during its 2004 outburst at a luminosity of @xmath6 by both _ rxte _ & _ xmm _ @xcite . the observations by _ xmm _ are critical here as they provide coverage at energies below 3 kev whereas _",
    "rxte _ is limited to energies above this .",
    "it was found that a cool disc blackbody ( @xmath7 0.35 kev ) consistent with an optically thick geometrically thin accretion disc extending to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) existed , in contrast to theoretical expectations .",
    "fits with reflection models revealed reflection fractions @xmath7 0.2  0.3 .",
    "previous observations of swift j1753.5 - 0127 yielded similar results for the cool disc component , in this case a disc temperature of @xmath7 0.2 kev was required @xcite ; however , no significant disc reflection features were detected .",
    "swift j1753.5 - 0127  was discovered by the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) at x - ray and @xmath8-ray energies on 2005 may 30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent observations with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) revealed a hard power - law spectrum @xcite , while pointed _ rxte _ observations detected 0.6 hz quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ; @xcite ) .",
    "the system was also detected at uv @xcite and optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "radio observations with the _ merlin _ array also detected a variable counterpart @xcite .",
    "observations at optical wavelengths by @xcite have also detected a significant modulation with a period of 3.2hrs , which they identify as a superhump period slightly larger than the actual orbital period .",
    "this would make swift j1753.5 - 0127  the black hole binary with the shortest known orbital period .",
    "in addition to the observations of @xcite above , a number of other high energy studies of this source have been published , which we summarize below ( see fig .",
    "[ asmlc ] ) .",
    "an analysis of _ rxte _ observations of the outburst was reported in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was found to be consistent with a power - law ( @xmath9 ) , while low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were also detected ( up to 0.9 hz ) .",
    "@xcite analysed simultaneous _ rxte _ & _ integral _ data , which were also obtained during the 2005 outburst .",
    "the combined spectrum ( 3  400 kev ) could be fit with a model consisting of thermal comptonization modified by disc reflection ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "qpos were also detected here , but at a lower frequency than during the outburst peak ( 0.24 hz ) .",
    "to place meaningful constraints on the accretion flow in the lhs one requires sensitivity to both the soft x - rays ( @xmath11 2 kev ) , in order to detect the cool accretion disc , and higher energies in order to detect the most prominent disc reflection features ( 5  7 kev and 20  30 kev ) .",
    "_ suzaku _ with its large bandpass and low background , is ideally equipped to carry out these observations . in this paper , we describe observations undertaken with the _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory in 2007 , while swift j1753.5 - 0127  was in the low - hard state . in  2 , we describe our observation and extraction of source spectra and lightcurves .",
    "we proceed to analyze the data in  3 , where both phenomenological and more physically motivated models are considered .",

    "data were acquired over a broad spectral range ( 0.2  600 kev ) , with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ) .",
    "the source was observed at the xis nominal position for total uncorrected exposure times of @xmath7 95 ks & 82 ks respectively .",

    "the latest versions of the relevant _ suzaku _ caldb files were also used .",
    "the xis is installed at the focal plane of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt : @xcite ) and currently consists of 3 functioning detectors xis0 , xis1 and xis3 .",
    "xis0 & xis3 are front illuminated and provide coverage over the energy range 0.4 - 12 kev whereas xis1 is back illuminated in an effort to provide greater sensitivity at lower energies , 0.2  12 kev .",
    "the xis has a field of view of @xmath7 18 x 18 ( 1024@xmath12 pixels ) and was operated in 5x5 , 3x3 readout mode .",
    "in addition the data were taken in 1/4 window mode in an effort to minimize possible photon pile - up , giving a time resolution of 2s .",
    "as the downloaded data products had been processed via the _ suzaku _ pipeline v2.1.6.15 , the data were reprocessed from the raw telemetry files as recommended in the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide ( abc guide ) .",
    "standard screening was applied , in particular , we extracted _ asca _ event grades 0:0 , 2:4 , 6:6 with the data filtered to be taken outside of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and where the earth elevation angle was greater than 5@xmath13 .",
    "good time interval ( gti ) events were extracted using xselect , where the 3x3 and 5x5 observation mode data for each detector were extracted simultaneously .",
    "science images , spectra and backgrounds were then extracted from these event files .",
    "even though the observations were carried out in 1/4 window mode , we nonetheless suffered from pileup at the source position .",
    "hence the spectra were extracted using an annular extraction region extending from 30 to 250 pixels from the source position .",
    "this extraction region size was chosen so as to extract @xmath14 99@xmath15 of the point source flux .",
    "as the outer radius of this annulus is larger than the window size ( @xmath7 280 , 295 , 280 pixels respectively ) , the effective extraction region is the intersection of window and the annulus .",
    "the resulting extraction region has an area equivalent to 62% of the 250 pixels outer radius , hence , we expect to have detected a commensurate percentage of the total source flux .",
    "background spectra were extracted from a source free region of the detector , these are automatically scaled to match the data during the spectral analysis .",

    "the relevant events for each detector were then extracted by requiring det_type=1:1 and det_type=0:0 for the pin and gso respectively .    the relevant background and response ( pin / gso * 20080129.rsp ) files were obtained from the _ suzaku _ website .",
    "a gti between the data and the background file was then created using the ftool mgtime , which was then used to to extract the spectra in xselect .",
    "standard corrections were applied to the data , i.e. deadtime for science data , pin background exposure time . as the hxd background files do not include the contribution from the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , the expected cxb was simulated following the recipe detailed in the abc guide , this was then added to the background file . as a check on the accuracy of the background , a separate background estimate was made using the earth occulted data ( earth elevation = 0 ) .",
    "this was found to be consistent with the above background .",
    "a similar procedure is followed in the case of the gso spectral extraction with the following caveat : the background file exposure time does not need to be corrected , instead one must rebin the science spectrum to match the provided background .",
    "the sensitivity of the gso detector is background dominated , hence the high energy detection threshold is determined not by the statistical error but by the reproducibility of the background , here we conservatively estimate the background reproducibility to be 3% ( e.g @xcite ) . in fig .",

    "we initially choose to fit the spectra with a number of phenomenological models in an effort to provide a broad characterization of the data .",

    "unfortunately , the low energy response of the xis detectors contains a number of uncertain residuals , hence we additionally ignored the regions below 0.6 kev and between 1.7  1.9 kev and 2.1  2.4 kev in all further modelling .",
    "initially , the column density was fixed at a value consistent with previous detections ( @xmath18 : @xcite ) , while the normalization was allowed to vary independently for each spectrum .",

    "it is known that the reflection features of black hole binaries are generally weaker in the low - hard state than in higher luminosity states ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "the relative weakness of these features in swift j1753.5 - 0127  is primarily due to the low luminosity nature of the source ( @xmath82 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity in gx 339 - 4 ( @xcite ) was much higher when a strong relativistically smeared iron line ( @xmath83 significant , ew @xmath7 350 ev ) was detected ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the value we measure for the reflection fraction in swift j1753.5 - 0127  is comparable to previous lhs observations where reflection fractions of @xmath7 0.2  0.3 were measured in cyg x-1 & gx 339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , observations at higher luminosities require much higher reflection fractions .",
    "x - ray spectra of the black hole binaries xte j1650 - 500 and gx 339 - 4 in the vhs state revealed reflection fractions of approximately unity @xcite .",
    "the low reflection fractions inferred in the low - hard state may be interpreted as evidence for a truncated disc , e.g. @xcite . alternatively the disc may remain close to the isco with the low reflection fraction resulting from beaming of the hard x - ray flux away from the disc by a mildly relativistic outflowing corona , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a number of alternative explanations have been put forward to account for the presence of the soft excess observed in swift j1753.5 - 0127  & gx 339 - 4 .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the data from @xcite and find that while it is consistent with containing a soft disc component , a number of alternative continuum prescriptions that allow the disc to be truncated are also valid ; however , see @xcite who outline a number of issues with this result .",
    "@xcite propose a scenario in which the disc is truncated at larger radii ; however , the inner edge of the disc is irradiated by the high energy comptonized photons in the corona .",
    "this irradiation will cause the truncated inner disc edge to be hotter and hence appear to lie at smaller radii than is actually the case . in the model of @xcite , the inner edge of the cool truncated disc",
    "is seen to overlap with the inner adaf region . here in the overlap region",
    "the cool disc is heated to temperatures mimicking those of a cool disc at the isco .",
    "it is also possible that what we observe is not the accretion disc but instead a ring of material that has condensed from the corona .",
    "such an idea has been explored in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they find that it is possible for enough material to condense from the corona to produce an inner ring of material extending from near the isco to a few tens of schwarzschild radii , while the accretion disc is truncated at larger radii .",
    "in particular , detailed modelling was able to reproduce the soft disc components observed by @xcite in gx 339 - 4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two additional black hole binaries have been observed by _",
    "suzaku _ while in the low - hard state .",
    "@xcite presented observations of gro j1655 - 40 , while @xcite observed cyg x-1 .",
    "the observations took place while the systems were in the lhs at luminosities of approximately 0.007 l@xmath59 and 0.02 l@xmath59 respectively .",
    "we also modelled the spectra of swift j1753.5 - 0127  with a combination of 2 comptonizing components , to aid comparison of this data to the _ suzaku _ observations of the black hole binaries cyg x-1 @xcite & gro j1655 - 40 @xcite . for both of these systems ,",
    "the observed spectrum was interpreted as being due to a 2 component comptonizing corona , i.e. a population of electrons with the same temperature ( @xmath85 ) but differing optical depths ( @xmath86 ) , modified by disc reflection , diskbb+compps+compps .",
    "the parameters of our best fit model are listed in table [ specfit_params1 ] , while the fit itself is displayed in fig .",
    "[ spec_ii_images_2 ] . in table",
    "[ obs_comparison ] , we display the parameters for our best fit comptonization model along with those for the best fit models for cyg x-1 and gro j1655 - 40 .    the blackbody disc component is found to be cool ( kt @xmath7 0.1 kev ) and the inner radius of the accretion disc is consistent with the outer radius of the corona within the errors ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the best fit radius for the iron line is also consistent with this value .",
    "the high value for the hydrogen column density ( @xmath88 ) returned by this model is inconsistent with the available data and casts doubt the comptonization scenario as a viable model for the observed _ suzaku _ spectrum of swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "however , the presence of circumstellar matter or a local absorber could account for the excess absorption above that detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "we find an electron temperature cooler than that measured in both cyg x-1 and gro j1655 - 40 when the spectra are interpreted in terms of this comptonizing corona model .",
    "assuming the disc truncation model for the low - hard state to be correct , we would expect the electron temperature to decrease with increasing luminosity , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath89 we measure would imply that swift j1753.5 - 0127  was at a luminosity in excess of that at which cyg x-1 was observed ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to various luminosity estimates .",
    "indeed , we measure a luminosity of @xmath91 ; for swift j1753.5 - 0127  to have a luminosity greater than that of cyg x-1 at the time of the _ suzaku _ observations would imply a distance greater than 8.5 kpc and or a black hole mass less than 10@xmath92 .",
    "@xcite have argued that the inner radius of the accretion disc does not extend to the isco in the lhs state based on the _ suzaku _ observations of cyg x-1 and gro j1655 - 40 ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "they base their argument around 2 main points ; firstly the low reflection fractions measured in the lhs state show that either the accretion disc does not intrude too deeply into the corona or some form of outflow must be formed .",
    "they consider the outflow case to be unlikely as the reflection fractions measured in both gro j1655 - 40 ( i @xmath93 ) and cyg x-1",
    "( i @xmath94 ) are similar , whereas if the reflection was due to an outflow it would be expected to have a strong inclination dependence , which is not observed . here",
    ", we note that the errors on the reflection fractions measured in the case of cyg x-1 ( f = 0.4@xmath95 ) , call into question the validity of this inclination based argument , given the quality of the currently available data .",
    "secondly it is argued that the inner radius determined from fits to the iron k line in cyg x-1 ( @xmath96 ) is inconsistent with the isco .",
    "this point is much more ambiguous as their reported value of the inner radius is @xmath97 .",
    "this value is consistent with the isco for a schwarzschild black hole . as such",
    ", it is clear from the currently available data that there is evidence for a cool disc component , with an inner radius that in some cases is consistent with the isco , whether or not the cool disc component actually extends to the isco is presently not clear .",
    "finally , it is important to note the high mass x - ray binary nature of cyg x-1 . here",
    "the accretion process , namely accretion via a stellar wind , is significantly different from that in gro j1655 - 40 ( roche lobe overflow ) and as such may preclude detailed comparison with the low mass x - ray binaries like swift j1753.5 - 0127  and gro j1655 - 40 .    lcccccccccc system & l@xmath98 & n@xmath65 & kt@xmath99 & r@xmath100 & r@xmath101 & r@xmath102 & kt@xmath103 & @xmath104 & @xmath105 & f + & [ l@xmath59 ] & [ @xmath106 ] & [ kev ] & [ km ] & [ km ] & [ km ] & [ kev ] & & & [ @xmath107 ] + swift j1753.5 - 0127 & 0.016 & 0.31 & 0.1 & @xmath7 830 & @xmath7 205 & @xmath7 360 & 53 & 0.34 & 2.57 & 0 + gro j1655 - 40 & 0.007 & 0.74 & 0.2 & @xmath7 330 & @xmath7 26 & @xmath7 65 & 135 & 0.25 & 1.2 & 0.5 + cyg x-1 & 0.02 & 0.66 & 0.3 & @xmath7 103 & @xmath7 75 & @xmath7 200 & 100 & 0.4 & 1.5 & 0.4 +    , to facilitate comparison with the seds displayed in @xcite .",
    "the optical / nir & x - ray data are quasi - simultaneous , see  [ the_jet ] for details . ]",
    "our knowledge of role of the relativistic radio jets in x - ray binaries has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years .",
    "observations of numerous x - ray binaries have revealed the presence of a compact quasi - steady jet in the low - hard state , whereas in the high - soft state the jet is typically observed to disappear @xcite .",
    "these also point towards a significant contribution from the jet towards the overall energy budget of the binary system , with the jet luminosity being possibly equal to that observed in x - rays , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition , a significant correlation has been found between the x - ray and radio luminosities of accreting sources across a range of luminosity ( in eddington units ) , suggestive of a disc - jet coupling @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown how one could , in principle , distinguish between different jet models based on the magnitude of the reflection features present in the spectrum .",
    "in particular , reflection fractions greater than 0.2 could not be reproduced by their jet models , reflection fractions between 0.10.2 could be due to synchrotron self - comptonization in the base of a jet , while a reflection fraction below 10% could be interpreted as evidence that the spectrum was dominated by synchrotron emission from the jet .",
    "if the base of the jet is confined within a few gravitational radii of the black hole , relativistic light bending will become important .",
    "this will act in the opposite direction to the beaming of the outflow leading to a slightly larger reflection fraction @xcite .",
    "these models are also consistent with the detection of an accretion disc near the isco , as we have likely detected with _ suzaku_.    a break or cut - off in the high energy spectrum of black holes and neutron stars can be interpreted in terms of the electron temperature in a thermal comptonizing corona .",
    "the high energy spectrum of swift j1753.5 - 0127  extends to at least 200  kev without a strong break or cut - off in our observations .",
    "moreover , single thermal comptonization models fail to achieve acceptable fits . in the context of @xcite , the reflection fraction of @xmath7 0.12  0.21 measured in swift",
    "j1753.5 - 0127   is consistent with a disc that is illuminated by synchrotron self - comptonization produced in the base of a jet .",
    "a corona that is independent of a jet but which produces a non - thermal comptonization spectrum might be able to describe the data , but the base of a jet provides a natural context for the production of hard x - ray emission like that we have observed .    in section [ spec_i ] , we showed how the data may be fit with a power - law modified by reflection , this model is supported by more detailed modelling in  [ spec_ii ] . in both of these cases an incident power - law is required , the jet is a natural source of such a power - law . in fig .",
    "[ sed_jet ] , we plot the absorption corrected spectral energy distribution for swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the optical data is from @xcite and was taken during at approximately the same time as our _ suzaku _ spectra .",
    "in addition , we include v - band optical and j , h & k - band nir data points obtained in april and july 2009 at the magellan and mdm observatories .",
    "the v - band magnitude was found to be consistent with the previous measurements of @xcite , as such the nir data should be representative of the infrared portion of the sed at the time of our _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "the radio data points represent the radio detection shortly after the 2005 outburst and likely represent upper limits to the radio flux at the time of our observations @xcite , these are also consistent with the non - detection at 5 ghz & 8 ghz by @xcite .",
    "the solid line extending from the x - ray to the optical represents a power - law as might be expected from optically thin radio emission , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "this is similar to the slope of the optically thin jet in gx 339 - 4 @xcite . extrapolating this power - law to optical / nir wavelengths",
    "shows that a spectral break is required at optical / uv frequencies .",
    "analysis of optical data of swift j1753.5 - 0127  in its current state by @xcite favour a case where any jet emission is insignificant at optical wavelengths consistent with our extrapolated power - law , this is in agreement with an independent observation / analysis by @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown , based on analysis of optical data from xte j1118 + 480 , gx 339 - 4 & swift j1753.5 - 0127 , that the variability at optical wavelengths is inconsistent with being produced by reprocessing of x - rays in the accretion disc and instead favour a model where the emission in the low - hard state is dominated by the jet , e.g. @xcite .",

    "these observations point towards the persistence of the accretion disc at a much lower radius than previously appreciated in the low - hard state .",
    "estimates of the disc inner radius with both a simple diskbb+po model and a detailed reflection model reveal values consistent with the isco ( @xmath110 ) for certain values of both the column density and inclination .",
