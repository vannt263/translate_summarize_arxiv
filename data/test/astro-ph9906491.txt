    "the ultimate jet velocity may depend on the configuration of the magnetic field @xcite , and the jets accelerate up to asymptotic speeds that may be only a few times the alfvn speed at the alfvn point  at the alfvn point the jet speed equals the alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "this basic acceleration and collimation process may be the same for all classes of objects that emit jets @xcite .",
    "jets are susceptible to the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "the k - h instability of three - dimensional ( 3d ) jets with purely poloidal or purely toroidal magnetic fields @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , and of jets containing force - free helical magnetic fields @xcite @xcite has been extensively investigated in the supermagnetosonic limit .",

    "@xmath4 is the longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath5 is an integer azimuthal wavenumber , for @xmath6 the wavefronts are at an angle to the flow direction , the angle of the wavevector relative to the flow direction is @xmath7 , and @xmath8 refers to wave propagation in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions around the jet circumference .",

    "`` normal '' mode distortions of the jet , respectively . for a jet with uniform density , temperature and axial magnetic field ( top hat profile ) and a uniform external medium , the propagation and growth or damping of the fourier components is described by a dispersion relation @xcite . when the flow is supermagnetosonic , each normal mode , @xmath5 , contains a growing single `` surface '' wave and multiple `` body '' wave solutions that satisfy the dispersion relation ( cf .",

    "the growth rate of normal mode surface and body waves has a maximum that is inversely proportional to the magnetosonic mach number at a wavelength that is approximately proportional to the magnetosonic mach number .",
    "the body wave modes exist only for wavelengths less than some maximum wavelength .",
    "figure 1 shows the maximum displacements associated with asymmetric surface wave modes at the fastest growing wavelength and of symmetric and asymmetric body wave modes at the maximum unstable wavelength @xcite @xcite .",
    "the body modes show a reversal in fluid displacement at `` null '' surfaces interior to the jet surface .",
    "for example , the first pinch body mode has a null displacement surface ( fluid does not move radially ) at jet center .",
    "the second pinch body mode shows an additional null displacement surface between jet center and jet surface .",
    "the third pinch body mode shows two null displacement surfaces between jet center and jet surface .",
    "pressure fronts inside the jet become more oblique to the jet axis as the body wave mode number increases .",
    "the radial displacement associated with an asymmetric `` surface '' wave mode @xmath6 is approximately given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the surface amplitude @xcite . inside the jet surface the displacement is rotated in azimuthal angle relative to displacement at the jet surface in addition to changes in the displacement amplitude .",
    "fluid displacements associated with the asymmetric body waves show a much larger azimuthal rotation and have larger amplitudes in the jet interior relative to the jet surface than for the surface wave @xcite .",
    "only the helical surface and body waves lead to jet displacement off the initial axis .",
    "jet distortions comparable to the amplitudes shown in figure 1 have been observed in non - relativistic 3d mhd numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "when a jet is sub - alfvnic the helical and higher order ( @xmath6 ) surface modes are stable , but rapidly destabilize when the jet becomes super - alfvnic .",
    "the stability and behavior of the normal mode solutions can be investigated analytically in the limit @xmath12 . in this",

    "wave growth corresponds to the plus sign .",
    "note that in the dense jet limit , i.e. , @xmath28 , this expression reduces to @xmath29 , and thus the surface waves are related to alfvn waves propagating with and against the jet flow speed but strongly modified by the jet - external medium interface .",
    "the unstable growing solution is associated with the backwards moving ( in the jet fluid reference frame ) wave .",
    "the surface wave speed in the observer frame , @xmath30 , and the growth rate , @xmath31 , are strongly dependent on the density ratio",
    ". higher jet density is stabilizing .",
    "numerical simulations of low density 3d mhd jets @xcite verify that `` light '' jets destabilize rapidly near to the alfvn point .",
    "in the simulations , the observed rapid development of instability leads to rapid mass entrainment and slowing of the `` light '' jets in the trans - alfvnic region before the jets can become supermagnetosonic .",
    "the rapid development of instability at the alfvn point and subsequent mass entrainment and slowing of `` light '' jets can be overcome .",
    "to see what is required for enhanced stability of the helical and higher order normal modes we consider the asymmetric normal mode solutions to the fully relativistic mhd dispersion relation in the limit @xmath25  @xcite : @xmath32\\eta } u    \\left\\{1 \\pm i { [ 1 - ( 1+\\eta)(v_a/ \\gamma u)^2-(\\eta/\\gamma^2)(v_a / c)^4]^{1/2 } \\over \\gamma \\eta^{1/2}}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the lorentz factor , and the enthalpy @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the adiabatic index",
    ". a positive value for the imaginary part of the frequency indicates instability .",
    "note that the alfvn speed can be superluminal .",
    "when @xmath38 < 0 $ ] the jet is stable to the asymmetric normal modes , and in the limit @xmath28 it can be shown that @xmath39 thus , helical and higher order surface waves are related to alfvn waves and , of course , the alfvn waves propagate at less than lightspeed .",
    "the unstable solution is associated with the backwards moving ( in the jet fluid reference frame ) wave . when unstable the wave speed in the observer frame , @xmath40u$ ] , increases and the growth rate is reduced as @xmath41 increases .",
    "thus , relativistic jets are effectively heavier and can pass through the alfvn point with less rapid development of instability .",
    "these effectively heavier jets should be much less susceptible to slowing by mass entrainment @xcite .",
    "jets that survive the trans - alfvnic region without serious mass entrainment and slowing will become supermagnetosonic with continued expansion .",
    "the amplitude to which normal mode structures can develop on supermagnetosonic relativistic jets can be deduced from numerical simulations of relativistic jets @xcite @xcite . in the simulations",
    "the jets are perturbed by strong pressure waves driven into the jet at approximately constant spatial interval by large scale vortices in the surrounding cocoon .",
    "the cocoon vortices induce oblique pressure disturbances in the jet at approximately the relativistic mach angle .",
    "this oblique disturbance is at the appropriate angle to couple to the third pinch body mode ( b3 in figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows normal mode solutions to the dispersion relation appropriate to a relativistic jet simulation @xcite ( lorentz factor @xmath42 , mach number @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and the jet resides in a hot tenuous cocoon where @xmath45 ) for surface ( s ) and the first three body waves ( b1 , b2 , b3 ) of the pinch , helical and elliptical normal modes .",
    "these solutions are typical of supermagnetosonic jet flows . with the exception of the surface pinch mode",
    "all wave modes have a maximum in the growth rate ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the body wave modes have a longest unstable wavelength ( determined from the real part of the wavenumber where the imaginary part goes to zero ) which is slightly shorter than the longest allowed wavelength ( determined from the wavenumber in the limit @xmath25 ) .    [ h ! ]    figure 2 also contains a comparison between pressure , axial , and transverse ( radial ) velocity fluctuations seen in the numerical simulation with theoretically derived oscillations associated with the b3 pinch body mode at the longest unstable wavelength .",
    "the comparison indicates that a maximum theoretical pressure fluctuation , @xmath46 , successfully reproduces the observed maximum transverse ( radial ) velocity oscillations seen in the numerical simulation far behind the jet front , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "the maximum pressure fluctuation criterion ( @xmath48 ) found from axisymmetric numerical simulations can be used to predict the cross section distortions and asymmetric structural features that will appear on 3d supermagnetosonic relativistic jets .",
    "[ h ! ]    in figure 3 ( top panels ) we plot the maximum cross section distortions for the elliptical surface wave mode and first elliptical body wave mode at the maximum growth rate and longest unstable wavelength , respectively , where we have used the dispersion relation solutions appropriate to the relativistic jet shown in figure 2 , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "comparison between these distortions and those allowed on non - relativistic jets ( see figure 1 ) shows a considerable reduction in the allowed distortion .",
    "in general , we have found that the allowed distortion decreases as the relativistic mach number increases at wavelengths near to the maximum growth rate ( surface wave ) or between the longest unstable wavelength and the maximally growing wavelength ( body waves ) . at longer wavelengths",
    "the surface wave elliptical distortion to the cross section can be larger than that shown in figure 3 @xcite .",
    "high pressure regions accompanying the distortions along with the doppler boosting factor @xmath51\\right\\}^{-1}\\ ] ] and an angle @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the perturbation to the initial flow angle , @xmath54 , with respect to the line of sight , allows us to construct an `` apparent '' synchrotron emissivity @xmath55 . for the elliptical distortions shown in figure 3 , @xmath56 , and we also have found that @xmath57 . the curves of pressure and `` apparent '' emissivity shown in figure 3 are taken around the displacement contours where the dashed ( dotted ) lines are at the jet surface ( center ) , respectively , and the heavy lines indicate the innermost contour of the high pressure region ( surface elliptical mode ) or highest pressure region ( first elliptical body mode ) .",
    "the pressure and apparent emissivity plots indicate that two bright filaments will accompany an elliptical distortion .",
    "these filaments will wind around the jet as the elliptical distortion rotates spatially down the jet and can show brightness asymmetry as a result of variation in the doppler boosting factor induced by a varying flow direction provided the observer is located at about the beaming angle @xmath58 . at larger viewing angles",
    "this apparent emissivity asymmetry is reduced .    filaments produced by the first elliptical body mode will reside within the jet and will dominate filaments produced by the surface elliptical wave mode whose apparent emissivity falls rapidly inside the jet surface . the helical first body mode ( not shown ) would generate a single bright twisted filament within the jet which would exhibit apparent emissivity asymmetry , similar to that illustrated in figure 3 for the elliptical mode filaments , as the filament winds around the jet .",
    "the helical surface mode which twists the entire jet is found to result in little apparent emissivity variation @xcite .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz instability induced normal mode pinch structures have been observed in axisymmetric non - relativistic and relativistic jet simulations , and normal mode helical , elliptical , triangular and rectangular structures have been observed in fully 3d non - relativistic jet simulations . in numerical simulations large amplitude helical and elliptical normal mode structures have been found to lead to significant mass entrainment .",
    "this mass entrainment slows `` light '' jets and prevents them from propagating to large distances while remaining highly collimated .",
    "the growth of large amplitude normal mode structures can be slowed by high magnetosonic mach numbers",
    ". however , magnetic acceleration and collimation schemes produce jets which pass through a trans - alfvnic and trans - magnetosonic region in which the growth rate of the normal modes can be very large .",
    "numerical simulations show that `` top hat '' profile `` light '' non - relativistic jets will not survive this region .",
    "the helically twisted structures that we observe in numerical simulations are on much shorter spatial length scales than those of twisted structures seen at parsec and kiloparsec length scales on extragalactic jets .",
    "if magnetic jet acceleration and collimation schemes are to prove viable for the production of observed jets that propagate to distances orders of magnitude larger than the location of the alfvn point , they must flow through the transmagnetosonic region with sufficient stability .",
    "additional stability both linearly and non - linearly may be achieved by different density , temperature , magnetic and velocity profiles , through rapid jet expansion @xcite or by the embedding of a jet in a surrounding fast wind . in particular ,",
    "a higher jet density relative to the surrounding environment will slow the development of instability .",
    "the high jet density of non - relativistic protostellar jets relative to the ambient and cocoon medium behind the jet bow shock should allow the jets to propagate with sufficient stability through a trans - alfvnic region .",
    "for galactic relativistic jets or extragalactic highly relativistic jets magnetic acceleration schemes would require that the alfvn speed at the alfvn point be near to or greater than lightspeed in order to produce a relativistic jet . in this case , theory indicates that relativistic effects can be stabilizing and lead to a scenario in which relativistic galactic and extragalactic jets can propagate through the trans - alfvnic region with sufficient stability .",
    "once through the trans - alfvnic region , continued jet expansion leads to supermagnetosonic flow . on the supermagnetosonic jet relativistic effects",
    "serve to reduce the distortion amplitude of normal mode structures , and this reduction in distortion amplitude should lead to a reduction in the mass entrainment that slows and disrupts jet collimation . although distortion amplitudes are reduced the predicted pressure fluctuations combined with the doppler boosting factor suggest that twisted filamentary structures should be readily visible on relativistic jets .",
