    "improvements in sequencing technology have meant that phylogenetic analyses are growing in size and scope . however ,",
    "when a tree is inferred from data there are multiple sources of uncertainty .",
    "competing approaches to tree estimation can produce markedly different trees .",
    "trees may conflict due to signals from selection ( e.g. convergent evolution ) , and/or when derived from different data ( e.g.  the organisms mitochondrial vs nuclear dna , individual genes or other subsets of sequence data  @xcite ) .",
    "evolution is not always tree - like : species trees differ from gene trees , and many organisms exchange genes through horizontal gene transfer .",
    "it is therefore crucial to be able to compare trees to identify these signals .",
    "trees can be compared by direct visualization , aided by methods such as tanglegrams and software such as densitree  @xcite , but this does not lend itself to detailed comparison of large groups of trees .",
    "current quantitative methods for tree comparison suffer from the challenges of visualizing non - euclidean distances  @xcite and from counter - intuitive behavior .",
    "for example , the nearest - neighbor interchange ( nni ) distance of robinson and foulds ( rf )  @xcite , which is the most widely used , is hampered by the fact that large nni distances do not imply large changes among the shared ancestry of most tips  @xcite .",
    "in fact , two trees differing in the placement of a single tip can be a maximal nni distance apart .",
    "we introduce a _",
    "metric _ which flexibly captures both tree structure and branch lengths .",
    "it can be used as a quantitative tool for comparing phylogenetic trees .",
    "each metric on trees defines a _ tree space _ ; this tree space lends itself to clear visualizations in low dimensions , and captures and highlights differences in trees according to their biological significance .    in section  [ sec : metric ] we formally define our distance function , prove that it is a metric , and explain its capacity to capture tree structure and branch lengths .",
    "we also provide a brief survey , explaining how our metric relates to and differs from existing metrics ( section  [ sec : others ] ) . in section  [ sec : exploring ] we explain some of the applications of our metric .",
    "we show how our metric enables visualization of tree space ( section  [ sec : visualisation ] ) and detection of islands ( section  [ sec : islands ] ) , which we demonstrate with a simple application to dengue fever phylogenies . we also explain how our metric provides a new suite of methods for selecting summary trees in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we conclude with some ideas for extensions to our metric in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all rooted trees on @xmath1 tips with labels @xmath2 .",
    "in common with previous literature  @xcite we say that trees @xmath3 have the same labeled shape or _",
    "topology _ if the set of all tip partitions admitted by internal edges of @xmath4 is identical to that of @xmath5 , and we write this as @xmath6 .",
    "we say that @xmath7 if they have the same topology and each corresponding branch has the same length .    for any tree @xmath8 let @xmath9 be the number of edges on the path from the root to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of tips @xmath10 and @xmath11 , let @xmath12 be the length of this path , and let @xmath13 be the length of the pendant edge to tip @xmath10 .",
    "then , including all pairs of tips , we have two vectors : @xmath14 which captures the tree topology , and @xmath15 which captures the topology and the branch lengths .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is similar to the vector of cophenetic values  @xcite ( section  [ sec : others ] ) .",

    "since the euclidean distance between vectors satisfies the conditions ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) for being a metric , it remains to prove that @xmath33 ( i.e.  the distance is 0 with @xmath34 if and only if the trees have the same topology ) and @xmath35 for all @xmath36 $ ] ( i.e.  the distance is 0 for @xmath37 if and only if the trees are identical ) .",

    "let the _ length _ of the path from the root to internal node @xmath53 be @xmath64 .",
    "then for all @xmath57 , @xmath58 we have @xmath65 , which means that @xmath5 also contains an internal node at distance @xmath64 from the root which admits the partition @xmath66 .",
    "since this holds for all internal nodes including the root ( where @xmath67 ) , we have that @xmath4 and @xmath5 have the same topology and _ internal _ branch lengths .",

    "our metric is fundamentally for _ rooted _ trees .",
    "a single unrooted tree , when rooted in two different places , produces two distinct rooted trees , and our distance between these will be positive",
    ". it will be large if the two distinct places chosen for the roots are separated by a long path in the original unrooted tree .",
    "however , it would be straightforward to check if two trees have the same ( unrooted ) topology in our metric : root both trees on the edge to the same tip and find the distance .",
    "re - rooting a tree will induce systematic changes in @xmath103 , with some entries increasing and others decreasing by the same amount .",
    "the metric @xmath104 is invariant under permutation of labels .",
    "that is , for trees @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a label permutation @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "we note that alternative , similar definitions for a metric on @xmath0 are possible .",
    "in particular , the metric defined by @xmath107 gives similar behavior to the metric we have used .",
    "the difference between the two is that in @xmath108 , the euclidean distances are taken between the @xmath109 and @xmath19 vectors _ before _ they are weighted by @xmath110 . rather than a euclidean distance between two vectors",
    "( @xmath111 for each tree ) , @xmath108 is a weighted sum of two different metrics : the distance between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( first term in the above ) , and between @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( second term ) .",
    "a benefit of @xmath116 is that it is linear in @xmath110 , so that the changes as @xmath110 moves from @xmath117 to @xmath118 are more intuitive .",
    "a disadvantage is that @xmath116 itself is not euclidean , leading to ( typically only slightly ) poorer - quality visualization in mds plots ( section  [ sec : visualisation ] ) .       to illustrate the effect of changing @xmath110 .",
    "the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is fixed for @xmath17 $ ] because their unmatched edges have the same length . @xmath121 for @xmath36 $ ] because the edge which @xmath119 and @xmath122 share and which is not found in @xmath5 is shorter in @xmath122 than in @xmath119 .",
    "most entries increase with @xmath110 .",
    "the only distance to decrease as @xmath123 is @xmath124 , because the difference between the lengths of their unmatched branches is less than one.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the parameter @xmath110 allows the user to choose to what extent the branch lengths of a tree , vs its topology alone , contribute to the tree distance .",
    "the distance between two trees may increase or decrease as @xmath110 increases from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "since the topology - based vector , @xmath109 , contains the number of edges along paths in the tree , and @xmath19 contains the path lengths , the branch lengths are implicitly compared to @xmath118 in the convex combination @xmath111 . in other words , if the branch lengths are much larger than 1 , then the entries of @xmath19 will be much larger than the corresponding entries of @xmath109 , and @xmath19 will dominate in the expression for @xmath111 even when @xmath110 is relatively small .",
    "conversely , if the branch lengths are much less than 1 , the entries of @xmath19 will be much less than those of @xmath109 , and a value of @xmath110 near 1 will be required in order for lengths to substantially change @xmath111 . in the case when all branch lengths are equal to 1 , @xmath125 and the distance is independent of @xmath110 .",
    "the example in figure  [ fig : lambdaexample ] may provide some intuition .    in order to capture length - sensitive distances between trees ,",
    "we may wish to use a value of @xmath110 such that neither @xmath126 nor @xmath127 dominate excessively , but naturally this will depend on the analysis . for a more gradual change in @xmath104 as @xmath110 tends to 1 , and for comparison of this change across different data sets ,",
    "it is possible to rescale the branch lengths , for example by dividing all branch lengths by the median , or by changing the units .",
    "however , this should be done with caution because information is inevitably lost through rescaling .",
    "for example , if a phylogenetic analysis of multiple genes from the same organism had produced trees with similar topologies but different clock rates ( e.g.  branches in trees from gene 1 were typically twice as long as branches in trees from gene 2 ) , this information would be obscured by rescaling .",
    "various metrics have been defined on phylogenetic trees .",
    "for a recent comparative survey , see  @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is similar to the cophenetic vector of cardona et al .",
    "@xcite , following sokal and rohlf  @xcite , where @xmath12 is called the _ cophenetic value _ of tips @xmath10 and @xmath11 . parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of our proof",
    "follow directly from results in  @xcite . instead of",
    "the pendant branch lengths @xmath13 , cardona et al .  use the depth of each taxon , which can be considered as @xmath128 .",
    "this involves a repetition of information between @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath12 whenever @xmath130 .",
    "however , their definition does allow for the presence of nested taxa ( taxa which are internal nodes of the tree ) .",
    "cardona et al .  also note that tree vectors such as these can be compared by any norm @xmath131 , but that the euclidean norm @xmath132 , which we also use , has the benefits of being more discriminative than larger values of @xmath133 , and enabling many geometrical and clustering methods .",
    "the most widely used metric is that of robinson - foulds ( rf )  @xcite .",
    "however , rf and its branch - length weighted version  @xcite are fundamentally very different from our metric because they are defined on unrooted trees , whereas our metric emphasizes the placement of the root and all the descendant mrcas .",
    "similarly , the path difference metrics of williams and clifford  @xcite and steel and penny  @xcite are for unrooted trees .",
    "they compare the distance between each pair of tips in a tree ; in essence , they consider the distance between _ tips _ and their mrca , whereas our metric considers the distance between the _ root _ and the mrca .",
    "these metrics therefore capture different characteristics of trees and are only loosely correlated with our metric .",
    "the metric introduced by billera , holmes and vogtmann ( bhv ) captures branch lengths as well as tree structure  @xcite on rooted trees .",
    "the bhv tree space is formed by mathematically ` gluing ' together orthants .",
    "each orthant corresponds to a tree topology and moving within an orthant corresponds to changing the tree s branch lengths .",
    "moving from one orthant to an adjacent one corresponds to a nearest - neighbor interchange move .",
    "the metric is convex : for any two distinct trees @xmath134 and @xmath135 , there is a tree @xmath136 ` in between ' them , i.e.  such that @xmath137 .",
    "this is a mathematically appealing and useful property , in part because it allows averaging of trees  @xcite .",
    "however , it does not allow the user to choose a balance between the topology of the tree and the branch lengths .",
    "we provide further comparisons in figure  [ fig : sixshapesupp ] .    our metric compares trees with the same set of taxa ( i.e.  the same tips ) .",
    "as a consequence , it is suited for studies in which there is one set of taxa , and trees can be compared from different genes , inference methods , and sources of data .",
    "our metric does not capture distances between trees with different taxa ; where the taxa overlap between two trees , our approach can compare the subtrees restricted to the taxa present in both trees .",
    "in contrast , comparisons between _ unlabeled _ trees take a different form ( e.g.  kernel methods  @xcite ) , suitable to comparing trees on different sets of taxa .    many phylogenetic analyses are , implicitly or explicitly , conducted in the context of a rooted tree . in the context of macroevolution , examples include estimates of times to divergence , ancestral relationships and ancestral character reconstruction . in more recent literature , most methods to link pathogen phylogenies to epidemic dynamics ( phylodynamics ) @xcite are based on rooted phylogenetic trees . for these reasons ,",
    "the fact that the relationships to the root of the tree play a central role in our metric allows it to capture intuitive similarities in groups of trees in a way that other metrics do not .",
    "tree spaces are large and complex .",
    "it is important to understand the ` shape ' of a tree space before attempting to summarize it .",
    "our metric creates a space which can be effectively visualized ( section  [ sec : visualisation ] ) and where _ islands _",
    "( distinct clusters ) of tree topologies can be detected .",
    "we demonstrate these techniques on a sample dataset of beast posterior trees for dengue fever .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we describe how our metric can be used to make a principled selection of summary trees .",
    "+      visualization techniques like multidimensional scaling ( mds )  @xcite have been used to explore tree space previously , but are challenged by poor - quality projections  @xcite .",
    "when a set of distances is projected into a low - dimensional picture , there is typically some loss of information , which may result in a poor - quality visualization .",
    "for example , if 10 points are all 3 units away from each other , this will not project well into two dimensions ; some will appear more closely grouped than others .",
    "however , if there are only 3 such points they can be arranged on a triangle , capturing the distances in two dimensions .",
    "one approach to checking the quality of a visualization is a shepard plot  @xcite , which is a scatter plot of the true distance vs the mds distance ( i.e.  the distance in the projection ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sixshapesupp ] shows the mds plot of the space of trees on 6 tips ( with unit branch lengths ) under our metric and two others : rf  @xcite and bhv  @xcite .",
    "shepard plots are included as an indication of the quality of each projection .",
    "each metric captures differences in both shape ( shown by color ) and labeling .",
    "our approach produces a wide range of tree distances and captures intuitive similarities ( e.g.  the similar chimp - human pairing in the yellow and gray triangles in figure  [ fig : sixshapesuppours ] ) .",
    "all 945 possible tree shapes and permutations of their labels are present in the input set of trees , and consequently there is no asymmetry that should lead to one group being separated from the rest .",
    "our metric captures the symmetry in the space and illustrates this in the mds projection ( figure [ fig : sixshapesuppours ] ) , whereas in rf and bhv ( figures  [ fig : sixshapesupprf ] and  [ fig : sixshapesuppbhv ] ) , poor - quality projections lead to apparent distinct tree islands where none exist .",
    "this makes detecting genuine islands in posterior sets of trees difficult using rf or bhv .",
    "the euclidean nature of our metric means that it is well - suited to visualizations that project distances into two- or three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the shepard plots illustrate that the correspondence between the projected distances and true distances is better in our metric than the others , though the projection distance can be much smaller than the true distance ( but not the converse ) .",
    "mds projections are of higher quality for trees from data than in the space of all trees on 6 tips ( e.g.  figure  [ fig : dengue ] ) .",
    "tree inference methods explore the set of possible trees given the data , but there are many alternative trees .",
    "bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods as implemented in beast  @xcite and mrbayes  @xcite produce a posterior set of trees , each with associated likelihoods .",
    "distinct islands of trees within small nni distance can share a high parsimony or likelihood  @xcite . complicating matters further",
    ", not all taxa in a dataset will have complete data at all loci . in this case",
    ", there are ` terraces ' of many equally likely trees , with trees in a terrace all supporting the same subtrees for the taxa with data at a given locus  @xcite .",
    "these facts have deep implications for tree inference and analysis , but the difficulty of detecting and interpreting tree islands has meant that the majority of analyses , particularly on large datasets , remain based on a single summary tree method such as the maximum clade credibility ( mcc ) tree with posterior support values illustrating uncertainty , or on maximum likelihood or parsimony trees with bootstrap supports .",
    "our metric can detect distinct clusters or islands of close tree topologies ( @xmath34 ) within a collection of trees .",
    "since distance is defined by the metric that is used , these are different from previously described tree islands  @xcite .",
    "+    we demonstrate our approach using the examples from the original paper introducing beast  @xcite , where drummond and rambaut demonstrated their bayesian analysis on 17 dengue virus serotype 4 sequences from  @xcite under varying priors for model and clock rate . as a means of comparing posterior tree distributions under different beast settings , we ran the ` xml ` files provided in  @xcite through beast v1.8 and analyzed the resulting trees . in figure",
    "[ fig : dengue ] we demonstrate mds plots of two of these analyses : figure [ fig : denguegi ] is a sample of the posterior under the standard gtr + @xmath138 + i substitution model with uncorrelated lognormal - distributed relaxed molecular clock ; figure [ fig : denguecp ] is a sample from the posterior under the codon - position specific substitution model gtr + cp , with a strict clock .",
    "these analyses demonstrate some of the different signals which can be detected by visualizing the metric s tree distances : distinct islands are visible in ( a ) , whereas in ( b ) there are some tight bunches of points but the posterior is not as clearly separated into distinct islands .",
    "additionally , trees in ( b ) are more tightly grouped together , indicating that is less conflict in the phylogenetic signals in ( b ) .",
    "we ran beast twice with the settings from ( a ) ( using different random starting seeds ) , and found that the space of trees explored and accepted in each run was similar , with the same islands .",
    "it is also encouraging that the mcc tree from the first beast run had the same topology as that from the second run , and that this topology sits in the largest island ( yellow triangle in figure [ fig : denguegi ] ) .",
    "similarly , the mcc tree is in the largest cluster in ( b ) .",
    "islands are of concern for tree inference and for outcomes that require the topology of tree , which will affect ancestral character reconstruction and consequently the interpretation of many phylogenetic datasets  @xcite . however , other analyses , and tree estimation methods themselves , take trees branch lengths as well as topology into account .",
    "we find that islands typically merge together in the metric as @xmath110 approaches @xmath118 ; the posterior becomes unimodal .",
    "summarizing groups of phylogenetic trees is challenging , particularly when there are different alternative and inconsistent topologies  @xcite .",
    "mcc trees can summarize posterior distributions ; they rely on including the clades with the strongest posterior support but where these are not concordant the resulting mcc trees can have negative branch lengths .",
    "furthermore , the mcc tree itself may never have been sampled by the mcmc chain , casting doubt on its ability to reflect the relationships in the data .",
    "our metric allows us to find ` central ' trees within any group of trees : a posterior set of trees , or any island or cluster of trees . to do this",
    ", we exploit the fact that our metric is simply the euclidean distance between the two vectors @xmath139 and @xmath140 . among @xmath141 trees",
    "@xmath142 @xmath143 in a posterior sample , we can find the tree closest to the average vector @xmath144 .",
    "the average vector @xmath145 may not in itself represent a tree , but we can then find the tree vectors from our sample which are closest to this average .",
    "these vectors correspond to trees , @xmath119 , ( not necessarily unique ) which minimize the distance between @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this minimal distance is a measure of the quality of the summary : if it is small , @xmath119 is close to ` average ' in the posterior .",
    "@xmath119 is known as the geometric median tree  @xcite .",
    "the geometric median is one of a range of barycentric methods which can be used with our metric to select a tree as a representative of a group .",
    "it is also straightforward to weight trees by likelihood or other characteristics when finding the geometric median .",
    "this provides a suite of tools for summarizing collections of trees .",
    "geometric median trees will always have been sampled by the mcmc , and will not have negative branch lengths .",
    "we found that within islands , geometric median trees are very close to the mcc tree for the island .",
    "the fact that our metric is a euclidean distance between two vectors whose components have an intuitive description means that simple extensions are straightforward to imagine and to compute .",
    "for example , it may be the case that the placement of a particular tip is a key question .",
    "this could occur , for example , in a real - time analysis of an outbreak , where new cases need to be placed on an existing phylogeny to determine the likely source of infection .",
    "we could form a metric that emphasizes differences in the placement of a particular tip ( say , @xmath147 ) , by weighting @xmath147 s entries of @xmath109 and @xmath19 highly compared to all other entries . in this new metric",
    ", trees would appear similar if their placement of @xmath147 was similar ; patterns of ancestry among the other tips would contribute less to the distance . indeed , it is possible to design numerous metrics , extending this one and others , and using linear combinations of existing metrics  @xcite .",
    "our metric enables quantitative comparison of trees .",
    "it is relevant to viral , bacterial and higher organisms and can help to reveal distinct , likely patterns of evolution .",
    "it allows quantitative comparison of tree estimation methods and can provide a heuristic for convergence of tree estimates .",
    "there are also many applications in comparing trees derived from different data .",
    "for example , the metric can be used to detect informative sites which , when removed from sequence alignments , change the phylogeny substantially .",
    "more generally , our metric can find distances between any rooted , labeled trees with the same set of tips .",
    "it can be used to compare tree structures from a variety of scientific disciplines , including decision trees , network spanning trees , hierarchical clustering trees and language trees ."
