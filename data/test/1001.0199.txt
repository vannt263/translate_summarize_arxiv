    "the flight management infrastructure ( fmi ) product is intended to keep the aircraft from interfering with preplanned observations on the sky .",
    "it predicts the ground tracks necessary to execute its mission , and corrects the plan for actual conditions while airborne . to support this ,",
    "it contains both a planning component that can run on the ground and in the air , and an execution component that runs in the air .",
    "the planning component manages a set of ordered observations and optional aircraft repositioning requests .",
    "the execution component compares the plan to actual conditions in flight and requests headings ( indirectly ) from the autopilot .",
    "sofia mission planning differs from satellite or ground based observatory planning in a few key areas .",
    "most importantly , the observatory position is a function of observation target history , which prevents observations from being considered as time - slots alone .",
    "assignment of flight dates is also nontrivial  targets can not be localized on the sky or the observatory will always fly in about the same direction ( requiring nearly equivalent dead time to return ) ; this suggests entire flight series should be considered at once , for greater target variety .",
    "flight planning and execution differs from conventional as well .",
    "all conventional aircraft fly from point to point along specified paths on the ground , and `` drift '' the aircraft to compensate for winds .",
    "typical drift angles ( course - heading ) exceed 3@xmath0 , and the worst possible case approaches 30@xmath0 , so sofia can not necessarily observe in this manner .",
    "expected winds can be planned for using a weather forecast .",
    "correcting course for _ unexpected _ winds can be accomplished by adjusting observation durations , by relocating the aircraft between observations , or by `` observation triage '' as a last resort .",
    "this requires an astronomically - aware airborne monitoring function to compare current conditions to plan .",
    "aircraft capabilities are a strong function of fuel weight , which argues against simple parametrizing by time , in favor of fuel .",
    "in addition to the geometrical and practical constraints described above , the sofia flight planning problem also has a number of external constraints , all of which prevent a truly automated , or even rigorously sequential , flight planning process . for instance , special use airspace ( sua ) incursions may require external approval , and it can not be known ahead of time whether such approval will be forthcoming in all cases .",
    "national airspace boundaries require international agreements . over - ocean operations",
    "are prohibited for safety reasons for the first flights ; for later flights , fairly complex fuel reserve constraints are required .",
    "gross takeoff weight has a hard limit of 700,000 pounds , which limits the duration of sofia missions .",
    "some science - driven constraints require interaction with scientists or detailed knowledge of the observations ; especially , trading off water vapor overburden estimates with altitude and duration , and for trading off observations against each other .",
    "prior to any particular mission , several iterations of flight planning are performed .",
    "this is expected to include fully integrated automated flight planning ( frank , gross , & krkl 2004 ) , routinely .",
    "manual choice of observation ( including order ) will occur subsequently . upon execution , replanning might occur if conditions are sufficiently different from assumptions .",
    "figure  [ fig : sampleflight ] shows a color - processed screenshot of a simulated flight intended for april , 2008 , from palmdale , ca .",
    "actual conditions for the simulation shown differ from planned only by small timing errors of the order of several seconds between segments and at takeoff .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it is advantageous to consider entire flight series at once , in order to trade observations between flights .",
    "the data structure supporting this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flightseries ] .",
    "fmi requires substantial input data in order to accurately predict a flight track and its constraints .",
    "weather forecast time - series are taken from the national center for environmental prediction global forecasting system , quadrilinearly interpolated .",
    "an alternative is required for dates more than several days in the future , since accurate forecasts are not available then ; we use a set of stacked monthly means for 19972001 ( the last years available ) from the european center for medium ranger weather forcasting 40 year reanalysis ( uppala et .",
    "al . 2005 ) also quadrilinearly interpolated .",
    "aircraft performance is interpolated from tables generated by boeing inflt runs , for cruising , thrust - limited climbs , and descents .    planned flight track intersections with special use airspace ( sua ) boundaries ( including non - us zones , from the us national imagery and mapping agency ) are evaluated using a quadtree - based search on the 8000 + sua boundaries for each flight segment .",
    "observation segments are treated as initial value problems in cartesian coordinates , others may be boundary or initial problems , as appropriate .",
    "desired headings are calculated during execution from planned ( not actual ) sky coordinates and actual position ; direct steering by the telescope can not be allowed for safety reasons .    in order to test fmi components and integrate other systems , as well as for training purposes",
    ", we use a simulation environment .",
    "this includes a medium - fidelity aircraft simulator , an automated pilot simulator , a method to set the time arbitrarily , and a telescope simulator ( brggenwirth , gross , nelbach , & shuping 2008 ) .    while airborne , the fmi software components interact with the airborne data acquisition software to acquire the aircraft s position and attitude . while on the ground , the planner portion of fmi interacts with observers planning software and must support multiple simultaneous planning sessions .",
    "the airborne configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataflow ] ; the ground configuration is similar , except there is no flight executor nor mccs data ( except in testing configurations ) , and there is a connection to the observation planning database .",
    "sofia presents a unique flight planning problem due to the nature of astronomical observation .",
    "fmi provides a connection between scientific needs of an observatory with the practical constraints of operating an aircraft , without introducing excessive safety considerations or pilot workload , or planner effort .",
