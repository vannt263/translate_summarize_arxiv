    "the dna molecules were linked to polystyrene beads of @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "beads lying near a nucleus were trapped by optical tweezers and pulled away . in some cases dragging the bead pulled the whole nucleus behind it at a distance ( fig .  [",

    "al @xcite proposed a model in which the shrinking remaining segment of the dna applies an _ increasing _ resistance against the uptake .",
    "they argue that because the entropic spring constant of a chain of length @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 and the average separation of the two ends of the remaining dna segment ( caused by volume exclusion by the bead and the nucleus ) is proportional to @xmath9 , the resulting entropic repulsion diverges as their product , @xmath10 .",
    "however , a detailed statistical analysis ( described below ) shows the opposite : the entropic repulsion imposed by the shrinking dna segment _ decreases _ as @xmath11 .",
    "this result makes it necessary to reconsider the proposed kinetics of the uptake of dna by the nucleus .",
    "it has long been known that a polymer of length @xmath7 , anchored at one of its ends to a wall ( with the other end being free ) , pulls on the wall by the force @xmath12 at the anchoring point , on average @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : ffree ] ) can be obtained in a way much simpler than the original derivation , using a simple _ lattice chain _ model .",
    "then we develop further this approach to take into account the role of the bead .    if the _ persistence length _ of the polymer is @xmath18 , the lattice constant of the equivalent three - dimensional lattice chain is @xmath19 , which is called the _ kuhn length _",

    "the constraint that the chain is not allowed to pierce through the wall is modeled by the condition that none of the @xmath22 coordinates of the chain points can be negative : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the number of kuhn segments .",
    "the partition function @xmath26 of this system is simply the sum of all possible chain configurations that satisfy the above condition .",

    "this can be understood intuitively by noticing that near the end of the uptake process the geometric constraints drastically reduce the available configuration space for the remaining segment , so it becomes more and more favorable for the dna to slide through to the other side of the membrane .",
    "although the reflection principle can only be applied to non - self - avoiding polymers , we expect a qualitatively similar behavior for self - avoiding ones , too . in this latter case",
    "the reduction of the configuration space should also decrease the entropic resistance .",

    "we modeled the double stranded dna as a three - dimensional `` bead - rod '' chain @xcite , and used molecular dynamics simulations to follow its dynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wlc ] ) .",
    "note that the `` beads '' of the bead - rod chain are artificial units and have nothing to do with the polystyrene bead in the real experiment .",
    "monte carlo methods were ruled out because they usually fail to reproduce the correct dynamics .",

    "the bond vectors can be defined as @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) .",

    "these forces are responsible for keeping the length of the rods ( or bonds ) fixed : @xmath63 .",
    "the constraint forces can be decomposed into the bond tension forces : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the tensions @xmath67 , represent @xmath42 new variables , however , we have exactly this number of additional equations expressing that the bond lengths are constant : @xmath68 . * @xmath69 is the bending force .",
    "the bending resistance is represented by angular springs between the adjacent bonds .",
    "the bending energy is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the _ bond length dependent _ bending modulus , @xmath72 is the included angle between bonds @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the bending force is thus @xmath75 . in the literature",
    "usually the bending modulus of the continuous polymer , @xmath76 , is used to calculate the bending energy even in a discretized polymer model .",
    "however , we realized that for a discretized bead - rod polymer the bending modulus should depend on the bond length to give correct statistics .",
    "the detailed calculations will be presented elsewhere , we show here only the result : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the dimensionless bond length and @xmath79 is the dimensionless bending modulus .",
    "the persistence length @xmath18 of the polymer is related to the bending modulus through the expression @xmath80 .",
    "a feature of this bond length dependent bending modulus is that @xmath81 , which reflects the known fact that a continuous worm - like chain with persistence length @xmath18 can be well approximated by a freely jointed chain with bond length @xmath82 on the large scale .",
    "* @xmath83 is the _ metric _ or _ pseudo _ force , and is needed because the motion of a bead - rod chain in a thermal bath is different from the limiting case of very stiff bonds @xcite .",
    "the latter is a better model for real biopolymers , and the metric force turns the rigid rods into very stiff springs .",
    "@xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the metric tensor of the hypersurface of the constrained @xmath86 beads in the originally @xmath87 dimensional configuration space .",
    "the explicit form of this metric tensor for a linear bead - rod chain can be found in refs . @xcite .",
    "* @xmath88 is an optional external force acting on bead @xmath58 . in the application presented in this paper ,",
    "the polystyrene bead is attached to the end of the polymer by applying an attracting external force on the last polymer bead , while this bead and the wall of the nucleus exert repelling forces on the polymer .",
    "depending on the situation , the bond length @xmath89 may be too large to represent the filament contour faithfully .",
    "for example , in the simulation the dna molecule goes through a @xmath90 wide pore embedded in a @xmath91 thick membrane wall , while the bod length is @xmath91 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the bead - rod chain in this case would be very low compared to the size of the pore .",
    "for this reason we introduced @xmath92 `` virtual '' beads along each rod , spaced uniformly .",
    "their sole role is that external forces can act on them , and they appropriately redistribute these forces to the original beads at both ends of the bond they are sitting on .",
    "hence their presence improve the spatial resolution , as far as external forces are concerned .",
    "we used @xmath93 in the simulations .",
    "* @xmath94 represents spatially and temporally uncorrelated thermal noise , obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath95 .",
    "in our model we neglected the excluded volume effect for the dna filament itself , although we accounted for the exclusion of the filament by the polystyrene bead and the nuclear membrane wall .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions were also neglected .    in our simulations",
    "the persistence length was @xmath96 and the friction coefficient of the beads was @xmath97 , where the viscosity of the water is @xmath98 and the temperature is @xmath99 .",
    "we used the second - order runge - kutta ( or midpoint ) method to solve the system of first - order ordinary equations @xcite .",
    "the bond length @xmath89 varied between @xmath100 and @xmath91 .",
    "one can rely on the results of a dynamical simulation only if it is numerically stable .",
    "therefore , it is important to be aware of the physical processes that determine the largest possible time step . in our case",
    "the diffusion of the polymer beads and the relaxation of the angular springs pose an upper limit for the time step .",
    "the typical distance a diffusive particle takes during time @xmath101 is @xmath102 , where the diffusion constant is @xmath103 . to ensure that the typical change of the bond length is smaller than a small fraction @xmath104 of the bond length",
    ", the time step can not be larger than @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the friction coefficient per unit length . here",
    "the constraint forces were not taken into account . however , we expect that even with the constraint forces in effect the numerical error is still proportional to the typical diffusive displacement of the beads in one time step .",
    "the relaxation time of the angular springs is @xcite @xmath107 apart from the prefactor , this can be easily seen from dimensional analysis .",
    "thus , the time step can not be larger than @xmath108 either , where @xmath109 . in our simulations",
    "we used @xmath110 .",
    "the maximum allowable time step is then the minimum of @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "a dna filament threading through a nuclear pore is pulled by two opposing entropic forces from the two sides of the membrane .",
    "if the media on the two sides are identical , the length independent force terms cancel each other . because the length dependent contributions ( being proportional to @xmath113 ) disappear quickly for large @xmath7 , there must exist some active ( energy consuming ) mechanism responsible for the pulling of the dna . since the integral of the length dependent term ( from @xmath18 to the total length of the dna ) is in the order of only a few @xmath114 ,",
    "this force term is not even strong enough to trap the dna in a configuration where almost the entire dna is on one side of the membrane .",
    "the simplest way to implement an active pulling mechanism is to produce a difference between the length independent terms of the entropic forces on the two sides of the membrane .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. , via a difference in the ionic strengths or the ph values of the two media .",
    "even the simple lattice chain model can account for this effect if the chemical composition of the medium affect the persistence length @xmath18 of the dna [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flatticefree ] ) and ( [ eq : flatticewall ] ) ] .",
    "another possibility for the pulling is based on a ratchet mechanism @xcite .",
    "the ratchet mechanism as a means of active transport was first proposed by the group of g. oster @xcite .",
    "the idea is that inside the nucleus some kind of molecule is able to bind to the dna with a rate constant @xmath115 and to detach from it with a rate constant @xmath116 .",
    "when such a molecule is bound to the dna at some location , the dna can not slide back beyond this point .",
    "assuming that the possible binding sites for the molecule are separated by a distance @xmath89 , we can estimate the effective pulling force produced by this ratchet mechanism .",
    "the grand canonical partition function per binding site is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the binding energy and @xmath119 is the chemical potential for the molecule .",
    "the probability that the site is unoccupied is @xmath120 , and the probability that it is occupied is @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the partition function can be written as @xmath122 .",
    "the free energies of a binding site inside and outside the nucleus are @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "finally , an effective pulling force can be defined as @xmath125 note that this is the force necessary to stop the pulling .",
    "the pulling speed is proportional to this effective force only if the equilibration time of the binding of the molecules @xmath126 is shorter than the diffusion time of the dna over the distance @xmath89 .",
    "otherwise the pulling speed is smaller .",
    "the friction of the dna inside the nuclear pores can significantly slow down the uptake process .",
    "let us just estimate how long it would take for an entire dna to diffuse through the pore if there was no friction inside .",
    "the diffusion can be envisioned as the subsequent diffusion of @xmath127 kuhn segments ( where @xmath128 is the kuhn length ) .",
    "the diffusion time of a kuhn segment can be approximated as @xmath129 , thus the diffusion time of the entire dna is about @xmath130 .",
    "as expected for a polymer without self - exclusion , the diffusion time is proportional to the square of its length @xcite .",
    "the diffusion time @xmath131 for a @xmath132 long dna is in the order of 10 sec . because the uptake occurs much slower , in the order of 1000 sec",
    ", the friction in the pore must be at least 100-fold greater than the hydrodynamic friction : @xmath133kg / s .",
    "such a strong friction can be explained by weak binding of the dna to the nuclear pore @xcite .",
    "the experiments show that the uptake slows down in the end and the remaining length of the dna converges to @xmath134 .",
    "a constant pulling force @xmath135 ( produced by either a chemical composition difference or a ratchet mechanism ) corresponds to a linear potential @xmath136 with a reflecting boundary at @xmath137 . in such a potential",
    "the expectation value of @xmath7 at equilibrium is given by @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the measured equilibrium distance @xmath139 is compatible with an @xmath140fn pulling force . from the average pulling speed , @xmath141 m/s",
    ", one can also calculate the friction coefficient : @xmath142kg / s , which satisfies the condition given in the preceding paragraph",
    ".    the pulling force and the friction coefficient would be even smaller if the length dependent term of the entropic force was also taken into account in the calculation of the equilibrium distance .    , the bond length is @xmath143 , and the radius of the polystyrene bead is @xmath144 .",
    "the black dots represent occupied binding sites . the horizontal bar in the bottom left corner corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    "the gray scale indicates the position in the third dimension ( depth ) . ]",
    "we studied the uptake process by the ratchet mechanism using numerical simulations .",
    "we assumed that the molecules could bind only to the beads of the bead - rod chain .",
    "the simulations started from a configuration in which one end of the dna had already got through the pore , and the first bead was not allowed to slip back through the pore . to mimic the experiment ,",
    "a large bead of radius @xmath145 was attached to the other , outer end of the dna .",
    "the diameter of the pore was @xmath90 , the width of the wall was @xmath91 , and the friction at the pore was neglected .",
    "[ fig : dnauptakesimulation ] shows a sequence of such a simulation .    identifying the extended length of the remaining dna by its arc length",
    ", we plotted the extended length vs.  time curve , averaged over 20 runs .",
    "it resembles the experimental curve : it starts linearly and converges to a constant value , about @xmath3 , which coincides with the experimental one .",
    "the time scale of the simulation is shorter than that of the experiments , because we omitted the friction inside the pore , in order to save computational time .",
    "the negative side of this interpretation is that the uptake is stochastic .",
    "individual runs show back - slips at both the linear and the horizontal part of the curve .",
    "the stationary state of the system is not an energy minimum but a dynamic equilibrium between the fluctuations of the dna filament and the weak pulling of the transport mechanism . since such fluctuations are not apparent in the experiments , we examine another possibility for the kinetics of the uptake .    , @xmath146 , @xmath143 , @xmath147 , and the total length of the dna is @xmath148 .",
    "the curve is an average over 20 runs . ]",
    "a monotonous uptake can be achieved either by a strong continuous pulling in conjunction with a strong friction or by a strong but slow ratchet mechanism .",
    "in such a ratchet mechanism the speed of the uptake would be set by the small binding rate @xmath115 , however , the much smaller unbinding rate @xmath149 would ensure that unbinding is negligibly rare and , thus , the ratcheting is practically irreversible .",
    "note that the large @xmath150 ratio corresponds to a large effective pulling force .    due to the negligibly rare unbinding events",
    "the ratchet mechanism is also supported by the fact that the uptake can be stopped but never reversed in the experiments @xcite by applying pn forces on the polystyrene bead . a continuous pulling",
    "would be incompatible with this observation .",
    "the only phenomenon that can not be explained by such a ratchet mechanism is the convergence of the remaining length to a non - zero value .",
    "there are , however , alternative explanations for this :    * the non - zero distance might be an artifact of the image processing ; * there might be unknown structures on the nuclear envelope that prevent the polystyrene bead from getting in contact with the nucleus ; * the pn forces used to extend the dna might be sufficiently strong to deform the membrane by hundreds of nm - s at the vicinity of the pore @xcite ;    or a combination of these .",
    "our numerical and analytical studies of the uptake of dna filaments into the nucleus suggest two possible mechanisms for the uptake process . none of them can be ruled out on the basis of existing experimental data .",
    "one of the mechanisms explains the convergence of the remaining length of the dna to a finite value , but has an intrinsically stochastic nature ( back - slips occur ) .",
    "this mechanism alone can not account for the stopping of the uptake under retarding forces in the pn range .",
    "the other mechanism seems more plausible , it predicts a monotonous uptake , but requires additional elements to explain the convergence .",
    "only further experiments can unambiguously distinguish between these mechanisms , focusing on their differences .",
