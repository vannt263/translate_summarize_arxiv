    "[ sec : intro ] small volumes of simple and complex fluids that occur naturally in biological contexts or that are employed in modern technology , such as e.g. , in microfluidics , are often ( partly ) confined by a free surface that may be covered by surface active agents .",
    "these so - called surfactants may be tensids , lipids , certain nano - particles , or particular polymeric compounds . because they decrease the surface tension of the free surface , gradients in their concentration correspond to gradients in the surface tension .",
    "these gradients result in tangential forces at the free surface that drive flows in the bulk liquid .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called solutal marangoni effect , that is e.g. , responsible for the tears of wine @xcite .",
    "all surface active agents are to some extent soluble in the bulk liquid , implying that a complete dynamical model needs to describe the motion of the bulk liquid , bulk concentration of surfactant , the surface concentration of surfactant and the adsorption / desorption processes that exchange surfactant molecules between the bulk liquid and the free surface .",
    "however , for many practically important surfactants , the bulk solubility is actually very small .",
    "then one speaks of `` insoluble surfactants '' and only considers the dynamics of the surfactant that is adsorbed at the free surface . here , we restrict our attention to such insoluble surfactants at concentrations at which no micelles are formed in the bulk liquid @xcite .",
    "the governing transport equations that relate the material properties of the insoluble surfactant and the resulting hydrodynamic flow are well established for low values of the surfactant surface coverage @xmath0 @xcite . in this case , the linear equation of state @xmath1 describes how the surface tension deviates from its reference value @xmath2 , for a bare free surface .",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 is a material constant that is negative for most combinations of liquid and surfactant .",
    "the resulting tangential marangoni force at the free surface is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the derivative along the free surface and @xmath6 is the unit normal vector .",
    "for any ( linear or nonlinear ) equation of state , the surface tension gradient @xmath7 enters the tangential stress boundary condition of the momentum transport equation .",
    "the latter is accompanied by a transport equation for @xmath0 that accounts for advective and diffusive transport of the surfactant @xcite .",
    "the resulting system of equations may be simplified in order to apply them to various physical situations such as , for example , the dynamics of surfactant - laden drops or bubbles immersed in ( another ) liquid @xcite , free - standing soap films @xcite , liquid bridges covered by a surfactant monolayer @xcite , surfactant - covered vertical falling liquid films @xcite , films on horizontal solid substrates @xcite , and drawn meniscii @xcite . in particular , the latter geometry allows for an asymptotic treatment which results in a long - wave or lubrication description of the dynamics , via two coupled evolution equations for the film height and the surfactant surface coverage @xcite . in the following , we focus on this geometry , but we should emphasise that our main arguments also apply to the general case .",
    "many works only treat the case of low surfactant surface coverages and employ the linear equation of state in eq .  .",
    "the surface tension driven flow is then said to result from a linear solutal marangoni effect .",
    "however , there is a growing literature where a similar approach is used to treat the dynamics of free surfaces covered by large concentrations of insoluble surfactants .",
    "it is common practice to replace the linear equation of state   by a nonlinear one and leave all other terms in the dynamical equations unchanged .",
    "we argue below that this may result in governing equations that are thermodynamically inconsistent , since one must also amend the surfactant surface diffusion term .",
    "there should also be amendments to the basic equations which describe the influence of the surfactant coverage on wettability close to three phase contact lines of very thin films , the effects of phase transitions in the surfactant layer at high concentrations , and also the influence of a nearby solid substrate on such phase transitions that may result in substrate mediated condensation ( surfactant aggregation ) .",
    "the approach that we propose in this paper allows one to deal with all these cases in a thermodynamically consistent manner .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : first , we review in section  [ sec : filmsurf - class ] the ` classical ' thin - film hydrodynamic coupled equations of motion for a thin liquid film covered by a low concentration surfactant .",
    "then , in a preparatory step we decouple and re - formulate the two individual equations in a `` thermodynamic form '' .",
    "in particular , section  [ sec : pure ] gives the gradient formulation of the evolution equation for a thin - film of pure liquid on a solid substrate , for the case where capillarity and wettability are the dominant influences , while section  [ sec : diff ] briefly reviews the classical diffusion equation and places it in the thermodynamic context that we employ . in section  [ sec : filmsurf - graddyn ]",
    "the full coupled system is re - formulated as a gradient dynamics based on an underlying free energy functional .",
    "this thermodynamic form is used in section  [ sec : filmsurf - ext ] to extend the thin - film model to consistently account for ( i ) nonlinear equations of state , ( ii ) surfactant - dependent wettability , ( iii ) surfactant phase transitions , and ( iv ) substrate mediated condensation .",
    "we also note some differences to the models in the literature . finally , section  [ sec : conc ] concludes and discusses the limitations of our approach .",
    "[ sec : filmsurf - class ]        [ fig : sketch ]    if a hydrodynamic system involves a free surface that is covered by an insoluble surfactant , the boundary conditions for the momentum equation have to be supplemented by an evolution equation for the surfactant concentration on the free surface that accounts for transport of the surfactant by advection and diffusion and also for shape changes of the surface that act as effective source / sink terms @xcite .",
    "this equation must be solved in conjunction with the hydrodynamic equations and boundary conditions for the liquid film .",
    "these equations can be greatly simplified for the case of a thin film of liquid on a solid substrate .",
    "if all quantities in the film vary over distances with a length scale parallel to the substrate that is large as compared to all length scales perpendicular to it , one may make a long - wave approximation @xcite to obtain coupled evolution equations for the film thickness profile @xmath8 and the surfactant surface coverage profile @xmath9 , which is a dimensionless surface packing fraction ( or concentration ) , where @xmath10 is a cartesian coordinate over the surface .",

    ", we have proposed amendments to the basic hydrodynamic model that account for four different physical effects that all may be included through changes to the free energy functional .",

    "the ideas that we have presented can also be directly applied to films covered by monolayers of nano - sized particles that are not soluble in the liquid film @xcite , or any substance that remains on the surface of the liquid film .",
    "our results indicate that nearly all long - wave models found in the literature that extend the hydrodynamic equations for thin liquid films covered by insoluble surfactants by including non - linear equations of state are either not fully consistent or not complete .",
    "the most important differences between our model and those in the literature , as discussed above in section  [ sec : filmsurf - ext ] , are :    * when incorporating a nonlinear equation of state , most authors fail to note that one must also amend the surfactant diffusion term in the governing dynamical equations . * to account for a surfactant - dependent wettability , it is not sufficient to just adapt the derjaguin ( or disjoining ) pressure . the marangoni and diffusion term must also be amended . * to account for surfactant phase transitions , square gradient , or other non - local terms for the surfactant concentration must be incorporated into the free energy functional . in these",
    ", the gradient should be taken along the free surface . * when incorporating terms to describe a surfactant phase transition that depend on the distance between the film surface to the solid substrate ( e.g. , to describe substrate mediated condensation ) , the added coupling terms lead to additional terms in the equation of state _ and _ the derjaguin pressure .",
    "the corrections to models in the literature that result from following our approach will in many cases only result in quantitative ( rather than qualitative ) changes to the results , that may also be rather small . in some cases",
    ", however , the differences will be qualitative and significant .",
    "for instance , we believe that the oscillatory dewetting modes ( `` dewetting waves '' ) described in ref .",
    "@xcite for one and two - layer films with surfactant , are present in the model as a consequence of a broken variational structure of the governing equations that stems from omitting terms in the equation for the time evolution of the surfactant concentration profile . using the complete equations , all eigenvalues of the linearised problem are real , and thus all instability modes are monotonic .    the various extensions that we have proposed",
    "may all be simultaneously included so as to account for more complex situations .",

    "our approach may also be further extended to accommodate more general terms that one should expect to be present in the free energy functional , including non - local integral ( convolution ) contributions to @xmath113 , which are commonly used in dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite , which uses as input the free energy functionals coming from equilibrium density functional theory @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that points ( i ) and ( iii ) above are particularly important for a number of bio - physical systems such as , e.g. , the description of the surfactant layers that reside on the aqueous thin - film of the lung lining @xcite , where ( a ) the equations of state that are used are strongly nonlinear and ( b ) experiments show that phase transitions frequently occur , e.g. , in layers of porcine lung surfactant at the air - water interface at physiologically relevant concentrations and temperatures @xcite .",
    "similar results are found for calf lung surfactant , where an expanded - to - condensed phase transition is observed as the surfactant concentration is increased @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the ongoing surfactant phase transitions and their interaction with the hydrodynamics of the thin liquid film is highly important .",

    "<S> in this paper we propose several models that describe the dynamics of liquid films which are covered by a high concentration layer of insoluble surfactant . </S>",
    "<S> first , we briefly review the ` classical ' hydrodynamic form of the coupled evolution equations for the film height and surfactant concentration that are well established for small concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> then we re - formulate the basic model as a gradient dynamics based on an underlying free energy functional that accounts for wettability and capillarity . </S>",
    "<S> based on this re - formulation in the framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , we propose extensions of the basic hydrodynamic model that account for ( i ) nonlinear equations of state , ( ii ) surfactant - dependent wettability , ( iii ) surfactant phase transitions , and ( iv ) substrate - mediated condensation . in passing , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss important differences to most of the models found in the literature . </S>"
