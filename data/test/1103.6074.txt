    "one of the simplest examples concerns spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , which recent understandings increasingly view as exists intrinsically in solid - state systems @xcite , and is responsible for the quantum spin hall effect . in atomic quantum gases , so coupling has been proposed with a variety of approaches involving atomic interactions with electromagnetic fields @xcite , including schemes for two component or pseudo spin-1/2 atomic condensates @xcite and spin-1 condensates @xcite , and realized experimentally for pseudo spin-1/2 system recently @xcite .",

    "spontaneously formed patterns in spinor component densities , are essentially spin textures , previously studied in @xmath0he superfluids and more recently in spinor condensates for both ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic ( polar ) phases , especially with long - range dipolar interactions @xcite .",

    "[ fig2](a ) , the ground states are found to contain several plane waves with significant weights if they are assumed approximately to consist of a series of degenerate single particle ground states with momentum @xmath31 and if external optical trapping potentials are neglected . in this case , the spin - dependent interactions couple degenerate single particle ground states , and result in discrete rotation symmetry of the ground states . starting from the boundary of @xmath62 , with increasing value of @xmath54 ,",

    "it is important to emphasize that interference between serval plane waves may increase density - density interaction energy , which explains why the phase boundaries between the ground states with four and one , also with three and two plan waves , deviate from @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical results show for the two different types of ground states with square or triangular patterns , the angles between nearby plane waves are close to but not exactly equal to @xmath55 or @xmath56 respectively , and the nonzero coefficients @xmath41 are not all exactly equal , although they are of the same orders of magnitudes .    to validate our proposition that the ground states of a spin-2 bec with so interaction are approximate superpositions of degenerate single particle ground states in the absence of the trap potential , we numerically solve the gpes directly using imaginary - time propagation including the optical trap .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show spin component densities and the spatial dependence of the two order parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 for two different cases .",

    "the triangular lattice is deformed into almost square lattice distributions when @xmath13 is decreased into @xmath69 , and gradually evolve in the end into striped patterns reflecting the underline two - fold degeneracy as we further decrease @xmath13 .",
    "in conclusion , we study spin-2 condensates with so coupling . due to the competition among so coupling , spin - dependent , and spin - independent interactions , the ground states are found to contain one or two counter - propagating plane waves respectively in `` ferromagnetic '' and `` polar '' interaction cases , where both the single particle hamiltonian and atomic interaction energies can reach their corresponding minimum values .",
    "for `` cyclic '' interaction case with axisymmetric so coupling , the ground states can be categorized into two different types respectively containing four or three plane waves , leading to square or triangular patterns correspondingly .",
    "for asymmetric so coupling , the ground states are determined by the ratio of two so coefficients : @xmath74 . as long as ratio",
    "is decreased , the spin component density distributions can evolve from triangular to square shaped lattices before asymptotically reaching the striped pattern .",
    "this structure phase transition provides a clear signature for so coupling . in the `` cyclic '' interaction case",
