    "350  has been the subject of many studies in the optical / near  infrared and radio regimes and most wavelengths in between .",
    "it is highly obscured at short wavelengths and bright at long wavelengths .",
    "the object was originally part of the planetary nebulae survey of @xcite , but was later reclassified as an region .",
    "@xcite observed 350  at mid ",
    "infrared wavelengths and showed the optical nebula was offset from the radio source due to a strong gradient in the foreground extinction .",
    "@xcite determined precise offsets between the radio , infrared and optical sources which validate the @xcite model .",
    "350 , also known as the galactic radio source g70.31.6 , has been extensively observed at long wavelengths .",
    "@xcite provided a high angular resolution map at 2 cm which resolved the ionized gas into a clumpy arc  like or shell  like structure on scales smaller than 1@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite included this object in their catalog of  regions , describing it as a core  halo type while @xcite observed the larger nebula in the continuum and radio recombination line h76@xmath4 .",
    "the radio morphology is extended in two lobes to the nw and se and @xcite found a velocity gradient along the lobes which led them to suggest the structure was an ionized outflow extending 10 s of arcseconds from the center of the  region .",
    "@xcite presented br@xmath3 and br@xmath4 emission ",
    "line maps at greater than arcsecond resolution and followed this work @xcite with molecular line maps which they modeled as arising from a large scale molecular torus ( roughly perpendicular to the ionized outflow of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recent work has centered on near  infrared and mid  infrared wavelengths and higher angular resolution data .",
    "@xcite observed the nebula in the @xmath0band using speckle techniques to provide an order of magnitude higher angular resolution than previous near  infrared work , and @xcite used the subaru 8 m telescpe and mid  infrared imager comics to obtain 0.5@xmath1 resolution images and spectra near 10 .    in this paper , we present @xmath0band integral  field spectroscopy of 350  obtained on the gemini north 8 m telescope with the near  infrared integral field spectrograph .",
    "these data were taken in conjunction with the facility adaptive optics system and result in the most detailed data cube yet for the core of 350 . in an earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "we presented similar data for the  region g45.45@xmath50.6 . in that case , several massive stars were identified by photospheric lines and other objects showed signatures of buried massive young stellar objects . g45.45@xmath50.6 clearly harbors a rich cluster . @xcite",
    "make similar conclusions based on their eso vlt sinfoni integral  field spectrograph observations for the  region in the cluster [ dbs2003]8 .",
    "previous investigators have suggested the same may be true of 350 : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our data identify multiple continuum sources in 350 and support the multiple star model , but we also show that the excitation in the central few arcseconds of 350  is likely dominated by a single object ( the unresolved continuum peak ) .    in the following , the distance to the nebula is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite distance is derived from a compilation of velocities and a rotation model ; harris distance needs to be reduced due to a revised distance to the galactic center ( * ? ? ?",
    "* used a distance of 10 kpc ) . adopting a value of 8",
    "kpc gives a reduction by a factor of 0.8 resulting in a distance to the region of about 7 kpc .",
    "data were obtained with the near  infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) at the cassegrain focus of the gemini north fredrick c. gillett 8m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii on the night of 20 july , 2006 ( hst ) .",
    "nifs was used with the facility adaptive optics ( ao ) module altair in natural guide star ( ngs ) mode .",
    "nifs is fully described by @xcite ; see also @xcite for a more detailed description of similar observations with nifs as described here .",
    "briefly , nifs slices an approximately three arc second by three arc second field into 29 spectral segments of 0.1@xmath1 width ( the `` slit '' width ) and @xmath6 3@xmath1 in length .",
    "the scale along the spatial dimension is 0.043@xmath1 pix@xmath7 .",
    "the resulting `` spaxels , '' or spatial pixels , are thus 0.043@xmath1 @xmath8 0.1@xmath1 in size , and each contains a full spectrum covering one of the near  infrared bands .    in the present paper , @xmath0band spectra",
    "are presented for the galactic  region 350 . the ao guide star used for altair",
    "is located 10.2@xmath1 to the south and west of 350  and has an @xmath9 magnitude of 12.7 according to the usno catalog ( source i d : u1200_14213688 ) .",
    "there was thin cirrus at the time of the observations , and the seeing ( at 5000  , corrected to zenith ) reported during the observations by altair was approximately 0.45@xmath1 .",
    "the observations were obtained at relatively high airmass ( 1.5 ) , and altair was run at 500 hz .",
    "the observations consisted of a single coadded frame taken on source and a second frame obtained on a nearby ( @xmath6 50@xmath1 west ) blank field .",
    "each frame had a total exposure time of 600 seconds ( 15@xmath840s ) on source and 600 seconds on sky .",
    "nifs was oriented with a position ( pa ) of 70 degrees east of north to correspond approximately to the orientation of the large scale ionized flow from 350 @xcite .",
    "this pa is aligned with the outflow direction .",
    "the spectral resolving power of nifs in the @xmath0band is @xmath10 5160 which results in a linear dispersion of 2.13  / pixel .",
    "this dispersion , combined with the large format array gives a full wavelength coverage at @xmath11 of about 4200   accounting for some minor truncation in the final data cube due to the systematic shift of wavelength in each slitlet from the staircase design of the image slicer .",
    "the line maps and spectra presented here were obtained using the gemini nifs iraf data reduction package ( version 1.9 ) .",
    "the nifs iraf package allows for full reduction to the `` image cube '' stage where a final cube has a roughly 60@xmath862 pixel image plane and a 2040 pixel spectral depth .",
    "first , raw images are prepared for reduction by standard gemini procedures that create the fits image variance and data quality extensions .",
    "next , the data are sky subtracted , flatfielded , rectified spatially , and wavelength calibrated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full description of these steps ) .",
    "the last two steps result in a uniform spatial  spectral trace for each image slice row and a linear wavelength scale .",
    "it is important to remember that the final iraf data cube resamples each slitlet to two 0.05@xmath1 pixels for convenience ; the angular resolution in this dimension is still 0.1@xmath1 .",
    "a lamp image of ar and xe lines was used to determine the dispersion along each slice and as a function of the spatial dimension of each slice .",
    "a quadratic polynomial was used in this case which produced typical uncertainties in the position of a spectral line of approximately @xmath2 0.2   ( @xmath6 1/10 pixel ) .",
    "final spectra are interpolated to a linear wavelength solution .",
    "the spectra were next corrected for telluric absorption by division by the spectrum of an a0 v star ( hip 102568 ) .",
    "the spectrum of hip 102568 was corrected for intrinsic br@xmath3 absorption by fitting a voigt profile to the telluric spectrum .",
    "particular care was taken in the fit in order to remove this feature from the telluric standard as accurately as possible .",
    "the final wavelength calibrated , spatially rectified , and telluric corrected images were transformed into data cubes .",
    "the spatial pixel scale was resampled to 0.05@xmath1 in the fine dimension and block replicated to 0.05@xmath1 in the course dimension providing for a uniform scale as described in the previous section .",
    "line maps presented below were extracted from these cubes using nfmap .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength calibration is confirmed by the positions of oh airglow lines in the sky image .",
    "analysis of these lines shows the zero point is accurate to @xmath2 2.5 .",
    "the calibration results in an observed blueshift of the nebular lines of approximately 3.8   ( 1.8 pixels or @xmath1253 ) .",
    "lines are identified on a spectrum extracted from a 2.5@xmath1 diameter aperture centered on the nifs fov ; see figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the spectrum is flux calibrated using the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",

    "an image of the continuum near 21700   is shown in figure  [ c217 ] along with the radio continuum image from @xcite .",
    "the continuum passband extracted was 9 pixels ( 19.2  ) wide .",
    "the appearance of sources in our continuum image is similar to the speckle @xmath0band image presented by @xcite who report an angular resolution of 0.11@xmath1 in their image derived from observations obtaddiained under 1.1@xmath1 seeing .",

    "the brightest source in figure  [ c217 ] is source # 1 of @xcite .",
    "the size of the most compact source in our image , source # 8 of @xcite , is about 3.7 pixels in the fine sampling direction suggesting a fwhm of 0.19@xmath1 .",
    "source # 1 is more extended than this in the present image ( @xmath6 4.9 pixels ) , but this is due to crowding with nearby blended sources and the intense nebular emission surrounding it .",
    "@xcite report source # 1 to be `` point like . ''",
    "the 10 sources identified by @xcite are clearly seen in figure  [ c217 ] with the possible exception of their source # 2 which is close to source # 1 and not obvious in our image .",
    "the @xcite sources are indicated by filled circles in figure  [ c217 ] .",
    "an additional point source ( named `` 8n '' ) appears near @xmath13 which is indicated by a single contour in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "in addition to these objects , there are other knots or clumps which might contain embedded sources , or may be density enhancements in the region .",
    "these clumps appear to match well the morphology in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "an exception is the `` x - like '' structure centered on source # 1 described by @xcite .",
    "we see no evidence of this feature in the lower contours of the nebular emission even though similarly bright clumps from the @xcite image do show up in our image .",
    "the mid  infrared images of @xcite also do not show this feature , though diffraction spikes from the telescope secondary are present in their images .",
    "@xcite identified four bright sources in the core region of 350  covered by figure  [ c217 ] in 913  images with somewhat lower angular resolution .",
    "the three brightest , okym13 , were unresolved as individual point sources .",
    "okym3 was associated with source # 1 by @xcite .",
    "the source labeled stho1 in figure  [ c217 ] is the peak of [ ] emission in the maps of @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest stho1 is the location of an embedded massive star .",
    "there is no obvious point source in our continuum image or the @xmath0band image of @xcite at this position .",
    "the diamonds in figure  [ c217 ] indicate the mid  infrared sources identified by @xcite .",
    "the offsets between these sources ( okym 14 and stho1 ) are taken from @xcite and the postion of okym  3 is assumed to coincide with source # 1 ( also assumed to be the case by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite identified a @xmath0band source with each of these @xcite sources within the positional uncertainties of the mid  infrared image .",

    "their data are seeing limited and do not resolve any of the structure shown in figure  [ brgmap ] .",

    "this covers approximately the nifs field of view . equating this flux to the total counts in an approximately 2.5@xmath1 aperture results in a peak intensity ( one pixel ) of 5.5@xmath810@xmath16 erg @xmath15 s@xmath7 pix@xmath7 or 2.2@xmath810@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath7 arcsec@xmath17 .",
    "the peak br@xmath3 emission is to the sw of the continuum peak , although there is a second peak nearly as strong and very compact ( point like , superposed on extended emission ) centered on the continuum peak ( source # 1 ) .",
    "the @xcite sources # 4#7 are also centered on local br@xmath3 peaks .",
    "the rest of the @xcite continuum sources are offset from nearby local br@xmath3 emission peaks .    1   emission follows the br@xmath3 emission closely",
    ". the left panel of figure  [ ratio ] shows the ratio of to br@xmath3 for the 1 @xmath18p@xmath19@xmath18s line at 21127  .",
    "the ratio is remarkably uniform over most of the fov and has a value of approximately 0.04 ( uncorrected for extinction ) .",
    "this value , which would be larger in the absence of extinction , already suggests a hot star ( s ) with effective temperature 40000 k @xcite . the stronger 1 line , @xmath20s@xmath20p@xmath19 at 20587  , is not uniform , however , in comparison to br@xmath3 ( see the right panel of figure  [ ratio ] and discussion in ",

    "the [ ]  emission is clumpy and peaks on the source okym4 while the [ ]  emission is more intense and somewhat more concentrated to the central `` rectangle '' or `` diamond '' .",
    "the [ ]  emission has a maximum at the continuum peak ( @xmath120.2 , 0.6 ) which is unresolved ( i.e. compact ) . the [ ]  emission also has a local maximum at the continuum peak , but it appears to be affected by one or more bad pixels at the very center .",

    "this suggests that the region with strong [ ] emission corresponds with ( for which there are no identified lines ) .",
    "the range of species seen is consistent with the presence of recombination lines ( ionization potential @xmath21 24.4 ev ) and the lack of recombination lines ( ionization potential @xmath21 54.4 ev ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission is also detected ( see figure  [ spec ] and table  1 ) .",
    "the strongest line is the v@xmath2110 s(1 ) line at 21218  .",

    "the projection of the h@xmath22 emission seems to follow the ionized emission with the peak emission coincident with the br@xmath3 peak .",
    "there is a local maximum at the position of the continuum peak as well .",
    "the location and excitation of the h@xmath22 emission are discussed further in   5.4 .",
    "figure  [ velmap ] shows the measured br@xmath3 line center velocity ( in ) for the entire fov .",
    "the mean observed br@xmath3 velocity of @xmath1250  has been subtracted to show relative velocity differences in this map .",
    "this mean corresponds to a velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xmath23",

    "the velocities are overplotted with the br@xmath3 emission contours .",
    "each spatial pixel in the br@xmath3 map was fit with a gaussian profile over a restricted velocity range of @xmath12250 to 50 .",
    "this choice was made so that the 1 line at 21642   ( see table",
    "2 ) did not interfere with the continuum fit .",
    "the velocity map shown in figure  [ velmap ] was made with a modified version of the euro3d program @xcite produced by one of us ( pjm ) and called nf3d .",
    "the br@xmath3 velocity map shows a @xmath6 @xmath2 25  range in velocity centroids .",

    ", we call the single gaussian fit to the bright component of the line `` the principal component . '' when two gaussians are fit to spaxels near the continuum peak , the effect is to redshift the principal component by a further @xmath6 5  in this vicinity .",

    "figure  [ detail ] shows spectra extracted from individual spaxels at a typical location @xmath6 1.3@xmath1 se of the continuum peak ( figure  [ spec ] , left panel ) and a location @xmath6 0.2@xmath1 se of the continuum peak ( figure  [ spec ] , right panel ) .",
    "five gaussian functions have been fit simultaneously to these features using the spectral analysis program liner .",
    "good fits with rms residuals of @xmath24 1@xmath25 have typically been achieved by assuming that all five lines have the same fwhm as br@xmath3 ( figure  [ spec ] , left panel ) .",
    "poorer fits with rms residuals of @xmath6 3@xmath25 are obtained in the region within @xmath6 0.5@xmath1 of the continuum peak where the br@xmath3 line has a strong blue wing ( e.g. , figure  [ spec ] , right panel ) .",
    "the gaussian component fit to this wing has a central wavelength ( which is a fit parameter ) that is close to that of the @xmath26 @xmath20f@xmath19@xmath20d , @xmath18f@xmath19@xmath18d 21655   line ( see table  2 ) .",
    "however , this line is expected to be too weak to account for the blue wing near the continuum peak .",
    "in fact , based on atomic data used in the cloudy photoionization code @xcite , the 21655    line is expected to be weaker than the @xmath27 @xmath20f@xmath19@xmath20 g , @xmath18f@xmath19@xmath18 g 21647   line that is apparent in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "better fits are obtained for spaxels near the continuum peak if the fwhm of the blue wing component is allowed to vary .",
    "rms residuals of @xmath24 1@xmath25 are then obtained with a gaussian fwhm that is about twice as broad as the principal br@xmath3 line .",
    "there is no apparent reason why the 21655    line should be anomalously strong and have a width twice that of other lines .",
    "we therefore conclude that the blue wing on br@xmath3 is due to a mix of a second kinematic component of br@xmath3 that dominates in a small region near the continuum peak and weaker emission that occurs over most of the fov .",
    "it is interesting that neither the peak emission nor the width of this second kinematic component is centered on the continuum peak .",
    "instead , this emission forms an arc that is offset se of the continuum peak by @xmath24 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "whatever the source of the broad component , the contribution of the lines near 21600   make a significant contribution to the integrated `` br@xmath3 '' flux .",
    "for the spaxel shown in figure  [ detail ] , the broad line produces 50@xmath25 of the corresponding br@xmath3 flux .",
    "@xcite measured the optical , near  infrared , and mid  infrared positions of 350  with respect to the radio continuum @xcite using background stars as a reference .",
    "the @xcite position is consistent with later radio positions including the high angular resolution study of @xcite , and thus , to our knowledge , the @xcite positions are still the best available .",
    "more recent studies have assumed the near and mid  infrared peaks are coincident with the radio continuum peak @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the 2.2  and 10   peaks are coincident , within the @xmath6 1@xmath1 uncertainties , with the radio continuum peak .",
    "the optical and 1.6  peaks are located to the south west of the radio peak , and this is consistent with an extinction gradient across 350  as suggested by @xcite and @xcite and found also by @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed 350  in the radio continuum ( 15 ghz ) and in the h76@xmath4 recombination line .",
    "the angular resolution of these data is about 1.5@xmath1 .",
    "the continuum appears to be extended along an axis with pa ( e from n ) of 160 degrees and there is a strong velocity gradient from nw to se along the extended continuum source ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this has led to the accepted model of an ionized outflow along the 160 degree axis .",
    "the nifs continuum is shown superposed with the @xcite radio continuum image in figure  [ c217 ] .",
    "the two images have been aligned assuming the radio and @xmath0band continuum peaks are coincident .",
    "the large difference in scale and angular resolution are apparent .",
    "the overlay is instructive for the following discussion , but there are no obvious connections which can be drawn between features in the two maps .",
    "molecular line studies have been used to argue that there is a rotating torus of material with major axis roughly coincident with and perpendicular to the radio source .",
    "low angular resolution co data and modeling of hco@xmath28 line emission suggests this material may be rotating about an axis parallel to the outflow axis .",
    "@xcite first drew attention to a possible link between their ionized outflow and the molecular gas traced by co line emission @xcite , though they cautioned that the low angular resolution of the co data ( 30@xmath1 ) and the marginal evidence for a velocity gradient along its major axis made any link between the two structures `` premature . ''",
    "later , @xcite used observations of hco@xmath28 to argue for a rotating torus roughly perpendicular to the ionized outflow .",
    "the peak lobes of hco@xmath28 emission are separated by 8@xmath1 , so the scale of the rotating molecular torus is larger than the fov covered by nifs .",
    "the velocity difference measured between the peaks of the hco@xmath28 is @xmath6 @xmath2 2 , and the best fit to the velocity profile was found to be proportional to the square root of the radius .",
    "higher angular resolution observations were made by @xcite in the mid  infrared ( near 10 ) and by @xcite in the @xmath0band ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the former observations were diffraction limited based on the 0.4@xmath1 fwhm obtained on standard stars , but the images of 350  do not clearly separate individual objects owing to intense resolved structure / emission and blended point sources .",
    "@xcite fit various point sources ( figure  [ c217 ] ) to their data .",
    "the @xcite images , on the other hand , were obtained with a speckle imaging technique and are of similar angular resolution as the data presented here . the higher angular resolution and lower background emission result in more identifiable point sources within the central few arcseconds of 350 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite conclude that 350  contains multiple massive stars ; the former through excitation measurements of mid - infrared ionized lines and the latter based on the detection of multiple point sources in the center of the  region .",
    "the nifs data confirm various aspects of the earlier work , principally the @xmath0band morphology of the point sources and brighter clumps of emission which are dominated by br@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0band image of @xcite , the @xcite mid  infrared images , and our nifs images all indicate an abrupt cutoff in emission to the north of the bright continuum peak .",
    "the gradient is extremely sharp and the emission drops precipitously in 0.5@xmath1 towards the north of the  region .",
    "the gradient in extinction was noted in earlier work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but is seen very clearly in the @xmath29 and @xmath11 images of @xcite . the center of the emission shifts systematically to the south .",
    "this geometry has been described as an opening cone with the continuum peak at the cone s apex @xcite and the opening toward the south  south east .",
    "the dense molecular torus @xcite and other overlying material form the cone structure by obscuring ionized material to the north ; see figure  7 of @xcite .",
    "the constraining effect of the torus may be responsible for helping to shape the ionized outflow @xcite .",
    "the very strong gradient in emission evident in figure  [ c217 ] and the @xmath0band image of @xcite suggest a possible obscuring disk on small scales , but no kinematic or morphological evidence exists to support this picture , and the radio and near  infrared peaks are offset from the center of the torus ( see figure  14 of * ? ? ?",
    "if the embedded massive star associated with the continuum peak formed from the molecular torus , then it may have separated itself from this `` parental cloud . ''",
    "@xcite presented ionic line measurements of collisionally excited , , and at approximately 9 , 11 , and 13 , respectively .",
    "ratios of these lines suggest a relatively low excitation , typical of late o  type or early b - type stars .",
    "the radio continuum @xcite , however , requires more ionizing photons than a single late o ",
    "type star produces .",
    "@xcite thus concluded that multiple stars ionize 350 ( as discussed above for the nifs images , we detect continuum sources , # 1 , # 4#7 at least , which are centered on local peaks of the br@xmath3 emission ) .",
    "@xcite made a similar analysis and conclusion for w51 irs2 , also a massive star forming region .",
    "but recently , @xcite identified the exciting star of w51 irs2 directly through its near  infrared spectrum , and it is much hotter ( approximately o3o4 ) . for g29.26@xmath120.02 , @xcite find a best fit nebular model which also has a cooler central source than the observed spectral type @xcite , though their acceptable models do cover a range of  which includes the observed spectral type .",
    "the nebular emission in g45.45@xmath50.06 was consistent with the observed spectral types found by @xcite , but detailed modeling was not done .",

    "the strong degree of uniformity for the latter suggests the 20587   line variations are not due to differential extinction , but instead are due to structure in the nebula . if the variations seen in the right panel of figure  [ ratio ] were due only to variations in the line of sight extinction , then this would require a change in a@xmath32 of more than 10 magnitudes .",
    "the continuum map morphology is not consistent with this picture , nor is the average extinction found by @xcite in the central few arcseconds ( a@xmath32",
    "@xmath6 2 ) . finally ,",
    "the br@xmath3 and 1 21127   intensities are near maxima at the position of the continuum peak while the 20587   line itself is weak there .",
    "the formation of the 1 20587   line is complicated and depends on the physical conditions in the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "a large ratio to br@xmath3 is due primarily to high density @xcite which allows for enhanced collisional population of the 2 @xmath44p@xmath19 level .",
    "however , this level population can also depend strongly on l@xmath4 584   resonance fluorescence which is affected by dust absorption of the he l@xmath4 line and ionization of neutral h by the he l@xmath4 line since both processes destroy the photons which would otherwise pump the line @xcite .",
    "the biggest changes in 20587   line formation are expected for a range of central star .",
    "the @xcite models were for an average over the nebula ; in the present case , the nebula is spatially resolved and clearly is dominated by a point source ( or unresolved sources ) at one end of the fov . in figure",
    "[ depth ] , the ratio of 1 to br@xmath3 emissivity with depth into the cloud ( for a blister model ) is plotted for the 21127 and 20587   lines and a central source with   @xmath21 38000 k. the 20587   line strength changes sharply from inner ( close to central source ) to outer ( far from the central source ) positions in the cloud .",
    "thus , at any given point in the nebula , we would expect a relatively high ratio in the right panel of figure  [ ratio ] since the effects shown in figure  [ depth ] would be integrated along the line of sight .",
    "the range of observed values for the ratio in the right panel of figure  [ ratio ] then suggests that real density variations may exist across the field of view ( lower density near the continuum peak ) .",
    "a possible exception to this would be if we were looking along a line of sight such that a slab or blister was illuminated with a geometry whose normal to the slab was in the plane of the sky .",
    "but this geometry is inconsistent with the molecular hydrogen morphology ( see below ,  5.4 ) which suggests a face  on blister geometry .    in figure  [ density ] ,",
    "the cloudy predictions for the ratios of the 20587   and 21127   lines to br@xmath3 versus density from cloudy are plotted .",
    "the latter line has an observed ratio of approximately 0.051 ( corrected for extinction ) and is nearly uniform over the nebula .",
    "the former line has an observed ratio ( corrected for extinction ) that varies from about 0.33 to 0.84 .",
    "figure  [ density ] shows the cloudy prediction for the case of  @xmath21 38000 k and log10(phi ) @xmath21 14.0 .",
    "these results indicate that the 21127   line ratio is nearly constant over a range in density of 100 to 100000 @xmath31 while the 20587   line changes from 0.38 to nearly 1.0 over the same range .",
    "the ratios plotted in figure  [ density ] are integrated along the line of sight through the nebula in contrast to the ratios plotted in figure  [ depth ] .      the kinematics evident in the bright br@xmath3 line ( figure  [ velmap ] )",
    "do not fit neatly with any of the previous kinematic data that were obtained at lower angular resolution .",
    "figure  [ velmap ] shows a double lobed structure , possibly a flow , with a major axis distinct from any of the larger scale components discussed above .",
    "furthermore , the ordered red and blue shifted material is not well correlated with much of the strong br@xmath3 emission and the point of symmetry of the indicated flow is not coincident with the continuum peak .",
    "a possible explanation for the small scale flow is that it is created by a lower mass protostar in the nascent cluster .",
    "this molecular outflow is then ionized by the massive star at the continuum peak .",
    "a similar scenario was recently described for the compact high mass star forming region irs2 in w51 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the large scale ionized flow is related to the inner flow .",
    "this would require that the outflow is precessing or that details of the interaction of the out - flowing gas on larger scales than the nifs fov reorient the flow since the axis of the inner flow does not line up with the axis of the large scale ionized flow .",
    "the contours of the larger flow do , however , appear to twist @xcite and figure  [ c217 ] clearly shows more detailed radio ( kinematic ) observations would be helpful in understanding the transition between the inner scale and larger scale gas kinematics .",
    "@xcite argued that the large scale ionized flow might result from the expansion of material coming from within a small ( few arcsecond ) shell .",
    "they took as evidence for a shell the high angular resolution 2 cm map of @xcite .",
    "the nifs br@xmath3 morphology appears to match well with the 2 cm emission , but does not appear shell like ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noted the classification of 350 as shell like was problematic ) .",
    "still , the nifs data suggest an outflow originating within this small region which is likely confined or directed by the material around it . the large scale flow has a velocity gradient of about 6  arcsec@xmath7",
    "while the small scale flow gradient evident in figure  [ velmap ] is 25  arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the velocity reported for the core of the radio emission is @xmath1233   with respect to the lsr @xcite .",
    "the integrated br@xmath3 emission has @xmath23",
    "@xmath21 @xmath1262.5  ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the red  shifted emission in figure  [ velmap ] is at @xmath23 @xmath6 @xmath1230 .",
    "this suggests that we may be only seeing part of radio  emitting gas in the br@xmath3 map and that the red lobe of the br@xmath3 flow is really tracing the bulk of the radio flow ; that velocity is presumably the systemic velocity of the radio   region . in this model ,",
    "all the rest of the br@xmath3 emission is tracing blue  shifted gas outflowing from the central source .",
    "the spatially unresolved br@xmath3 emission at the continuum peak ( see figure  [ brgmap ] and  5.6 ) also has a @xmath23 @xmath6 @xmath1232  that is close to the systemic velocity defined by the h76@xmath4 emission .      in  4.3 , a broad component of emission was identified to the blue of the br@xmath3 line ( see figure  [ detail ] ) .",
    "the position of the line is consistent with one of the 1 lines from the n@xmath21 74 complex , but the emission is much stronger than expected based on transition probabilities and broader than any other 1 line by about a factor of two .",
    "thus , it is more likely a second br@xmath3 component .",
    "the line velocity is about 40 blue shifted compared to the background or cloud velocity ( the green regions in figure  [ velmap ] ) .",
    "this is larger than the blueshifted velocity structure of the principal component of br@xmath3 shown in that figure .",
    "the width of the broad component is about twice the width of the principal br@xmath3 component ( 120  compared to 70 ) .",
    "the broad component is distributed in an arc to the sse of the continuum source ( @xmath6 0.5@xmath1 in length and offset from the peak by @xmath6 0.2@xmath10.3@xmath1 ) and is confined to this vicinity of the continuum source .",
    "it is not clear how the high velocity , broad component is produced .",
    "it may be related to hot gas escaping a tightly constrained volume near the central source .",
    "the scale associated with the broad component is small , only 0.0070.010 pc ( for a distance of 7 kpc ) . in champagne flows that are produced as the ionizing radiation from the hot star penetrates into a uniform medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hot star quickly carves out a larger diameter cavity ( 0.1 pc ) .",
    "perhaps shocked gas initially flowing parallel to the plane of the sky and then being redirected along our line of sight could explain the broad component .",
    "this putative flow might be related to the central source stellar wind .    in any case",
    ", gas must escape to the north and eventually form the larger ionized flow seen in the @xcite radio images .",
    "the immediate vicinity of the continuum peak may be filled with low density gas , and this gas may surround ( or overlay ) higher density material within the projected `` cone '' which extends to the south of the continuum source . in order to explain the low ratio of 1 20587   to br@xmath3 near the continuum peak",
    ", the particular line of sight must contain very little dense ionized gas indicating this area has been cleared away as the hot star emerges from its parent cloud ( which remains mostly to the north ) . the high angular resolution 2 cm image of @xcite and",
    "the molecular maps of @xcite are consistent with clearing of high density material in the vicinity of the continuum peak ; both show voids or gaps in the emission .",
    "none of the current absolute positions is good enough to place the different wavelength data to better than about 0.5@xmath1 which is the scale of the structure in our data and the 2 cm map .",
    "the nebula is seen in projection against h@xmath22 emission , primarily in the lower left quadrant where the br@xmath3 emission is strongest ( figure  [ h2 ] ) but also ( unresolved ) at the position of the continuum peak .",
    "three prominent lines of molecular hydrogen are listed in table  1 .",
    "the average ratios of the two longer wavelength lines to the v@xmath2110 s(1 ) 21218   line ( 0.42 @xmath2 0.1 , 0.23 @xmath2 0.1 for h@xmath22 v@xmath21 10 s(0 ) and h@xmath22 v@xmath21 21 s(1 ) , respectively ) can be compared to the diagnostic diagram given by @xcite which shows these same ratios for a large sample of  regions along with several model predictions for shock excited and fluorescent emission .",
    "the bulk of the @xcite sample is consistent with dense ( 10@xmath45 @xmath31 ) photo  dissociation regions ( pdr ) .",
    "the results for 350  place it in the same region of the diagram showing it too is consistent with a dense pdr on the boundary of its ionized nebula .",
    "since we see both the ionized gas and molecular emission , it is likely the h@xmath22 emission is behind the ionized gas ( a large column of molecular gas in front would obscure our view ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the  region may be best described as blister like ; the hot star has emerged from the parent cloud and is ionizing the face of the molecular material to the south . in this case , the `` cone '' is really a flattened structure seen face on and lying on the surface of a dense cloud of molecular gas .      as mentioned above , @xcite analyzed [ ] / [ ] and [ ] / [ ] ratios in 350 .",
    "the observed ratios are consistent with other  regions , but inconsistent with simple ionization models .",
    "the models predict stronger [ ] / [ ] than [ ] / [ ] for a given , but the observations show the average ratios are of similar value and the peak ratios have substantially larger [ ] / [ ] than [ ] / [ ] .",
    "our grid of models agrees with @xcite in the sense that for a given , the [ ] line ratio is predicted to be stronger .",
    "@xcite computed ar , s , and ne abundances for 350  from iso mid  infrared spectra and find abundances which differ from the solar values ( and our cloudy models ) .",
    "in particular , the ne abundance compared to h is approximately solar , while the ar abundance is a factor of 2 lower than the solar value , and the s abundance is a factor of 10 lower .",
    "however , this large reduction in s abundance may be ( in part ) due to the high density in 350  depopulating the upper levels producing the s emission as @xcite point out . detailed models used to derive the s abundance in 350  by @xcite give a value only a factor of two lower than solar .",
    "the iso spectra were obtained through large apertures ( @xmath6 20@xmath1 ) , and the line ratios are smaller than the peak ratios in the higher angular resolution @xcite data .",

    "the [ ] emission is weak in the vicinity of the continuum peak compared to the [ ] line .",
    "the [ ] line is weak as well and this is consistent with its lower ionization potential than the other species present . in the case of okym4 ( figure  [ c217 ] ) , there may be some evidence for lower excitation ; @xcite preferred a late o or b star for this source .",
