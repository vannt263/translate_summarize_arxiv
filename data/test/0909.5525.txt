    "this circumstance has an important implication for both theory and experiment : to find the ground state symmetry one has to resolve small energy differences between the contesting states .",
    "thus , an approximate theoretical scheme might calculate these differences completely wrong ; a slight variation of the model may cause a phase transition .",
    "an experimentalist has to keep in mind that , despite the obvious similarities between various families of the q1d superconducting materials in chemistry and structure , despite  universality \" of their phase diagram @xcite , the superconducting order does not have to be identical in all these metals .",

    "( [ hbare ] ) , with the help of the mean field approximation .",
    "yet , one has to keep in mind that this idea is wrong .",
    "it is demonstrated by prigodin and firsov @xcite , who investigate the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the q1d metal , that at high energy the cooper channel and the particle - hole channel are coupled , the usual ladder summation is not adequate , and it is necessary to use the parquette approximation .",
    "failure of the ladder approximation implies the failure of the mean field theory , since the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "fortunately , this coupling between the channels is a 1d feature , which disappears at sufficiently low energy .",
    "indeed , it is also proven in @xcite that the weakly interacting q1d fermi system experience the dimensional crossover at low energy ; below the crossover the channels decouple , and the ladder approximation ( hence , the mean field theory ) is valid again .",
    "thus , if we need to know a low - energy properties of the model ( e.g. , the phase diagram ) , it is enough to derive the effective hamiltonian valid below the dimensional crossover , for this hamiltonian may be analyzed with the help of usual mean field approximation .",
    "how does this hamiltonian look like ?",
    "this question is addressed in several theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "these papers discuss in detail the dependence of the effective coupling constants on the bare one .",
    "however , for our purposes it is enough to guess general features of the low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "our conjecture is based on two assumptions about rg flow :    _ ( i ) _ at high energy the transverse single - electron hopping is the most relevant operator in the problem , and the crossover occurs when the effective transverse hopping becomes comparable to the running cutoff ;    _ ( ii ) _ at high energy the sdw and cdw susceptibilities are the dominant ; among these two the sdw susceptibility prevails .",
    "what do these statements mean physically ?",
    "( i ) _ is valid provided that bare interactions are sufficiently weak ( for an accurate criterion of the single - electron hopping relevance one can consult e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it guarantees that our low - energy model is fermi liquid with weak effective coupling constants and low effective anisotropy : @xmath28 when _",
    "( i ) _ is violated , the system freezes into an ordered state ( typically , sdw or cdw ) before reaching the fermi liquid regime .",
    "needless to say , our analysis is inapplicable in such a situation .",
    "assumption _ ( ii ) _ is a consequence of the electron repulsion combined with the fact that high - energy physics is purely one - dimensional . it is known that the 1d metal has strongly divergent susceptibilities toward sdw and cdw .",
    "of these two , the former is stronger due to the in - chain backscattering @xmath29 . because of all this",
    ", the sdw susceptibility prevails in the high - energy regime .",
    "this effect has nothing to do with the nesting properties of the actual fermi surface , which is a low - energy feature .",
    "moreover , one can say that this abundance of the high - energy modes , enhancing sdw correlations regardless of the nesting , is a peculiarity of q1d metal , which makes its physics so unusual .    taking _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ into account we can write the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath30 the spin - spin transverse interaction term @xmath31 is equal to : @xmath32 , \\nonumber   \\\\ { \\bf s } & = & \\sum_{p \\sigma \\sigma ' } \\vec{\\tau}_{\\sigma \\sigma ' }   \\colon      \\psi^{\\dagger}_{p \\sigma }      \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{p \\sigma ' }   \\colon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this term , although absent in the microscopic hamiltonian , appears at low energies .",

    "the cutoff of the effective theory is much smaller than the microscopic cutoff : @xmath43    hierarchy of the effective coupling constants differs from eq .",

    "the effective system remains anisotropic ( for example , its fermi surface consists of two warped sheets disconnected from each other ) , yet , this anisotropy is not as strong as the anisotropy of the original microscopic system .",
    "since at high energy the dominating fluctuations are sdw and cdw , @xmath24 coupling constants are enhanced : @xmath44 all coupling constants are smaller than the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath38 .    it is tempting to declare that , since sdw correlations dominate over cdw correlations in the high - energy regime , the sdw coupling constant @xmath45 is bigger than the cdw constant @xmath46",

    "the cdw coupling constant @xmath57 may be larger or smaller than @xmath58 , depending on the bare values of @xmath42 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the density wave type is determined by comparison of the coupling constants : if @xmath61 the ground state is cdw , otherwise , it is sdw",
    ".    when the nesting is spoiled ( for example , by introducing next - to - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath62 ) , the density wave critical temperature decreases .",
    "this happens because antinesting destroys the divergence of the susceptibility .",
    "for example , one might write for sdw ( the case of cdw is identical ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the renormalized value of @xmath62 .    when @xmath64 is bigger than certain critical value : @xmath65 the mean - field equation @xmath54 has no solution .",
    "thus , exponentially small @xmath64 is enough to destroy the density wave phase .",
    "when the antinesting destroys the density wave , the system becomes superconducting . to demonstrate this",

    "consider first @xmath4-wave ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this type of superconductivity is at least metastable , if : @xmath87 in the latter inequality we neglected @xmath88 and @xmath89 for they are small [ see eq .",

    "this guarantees that , after the density wave is destroyed by the antinesting , the q1d metal becomes a superconductor .",
    "singlet @xmath2-wave superconductivity ( @xmath92 ) is metastable , if @xmath93 , which is equivalent to : @xmath94    the true , stable ground state is determined by comparison of the mean - field transition temperatures for different superconducting order parameters .",
    "these temperatures are the solutions of the equations @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is either @xmath0 , or @xmath4 , or @xmath2 .",
    "let us compare first @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "these two order parameters have identical orbital structure .",
    "therefore , their susceptibilities are the same : @xmath99 .",

( [ f_vs_d ] ) implies that spin - density fluctuations , which enhance @xmath104 , favor @xmath4-wave over @xmath0-wave @xcite .",

    "( [ g < j ] ) is not equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ g < j_eff ] ) .",
    "therefore , this argumentation points to a trend rather than establishes a hard connection between the density wave type and the order parameter symmetry .",
    "the coupling constant for @xmath2-wave is always smaller than @xmath101 : @xmath112 this does not necessary mean that @xmath0-wave superconductivity always overshadows the @xmath2-wave superconductivity .",
    "these two have different orbital structure ( the former is symmetric with respect to inversion of the transverse coordinates , while the latter is antisymmetric ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to choose the density of states in such a way that @xmath113 .",

    "therefore , we conclude that , when @xmath4-wave is unstable , both @xmath0-wave and @xmath2-wave can be possible choices for the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "it is also important to note that the superconductivity becomes possible only in a system with sufficiently pronounced anisotropy ( @xmath115 ) . otherwise , the 1d renormalization is weak , and @xmath116 as a result , instead of eq .",

    "we demonstrated under rather general assumptions that _",
    "q1d metal has a superconducting ground state , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the symmetry of the order parameter is sensitive to the details of the interaction and the density of states .",
    "this implies that the `` universal '' phase diagram of the bechgaard salts @xcite is a robust feature of q1d metals , easily reproducible theoretically . at the same time , prediction of the order parameter symmetry on the basis of the microscopic model is virtually impossible for it requires very accurate calculations of the competing states energies",
    ".    one must remember that different q1d organic superconductors , despite many similarities they share , may have different symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that an individual sample experience a phase transition between different types of superconductivity , if the external parameters ( pressure , magnetic field ) change . it is possible that such a phenomena is indeed observed experimentally : within the superconducting region of ( tmtsf)clo a phase transition is detected when the external magnetic field exceeds some critical value @xcite .    our approach , however , has some limitations .",
