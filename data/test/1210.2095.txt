    "various findings from the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) generated in the heavy ion collisions suggest that qgp behaves as a nearly perfect fluid @xcite , which involves non - perturbative physics suitable for the application of the ads / cft duality .",
    "although the @xmath0 sym is conformal , which differs from qcd in many properties , it may reveal some of qualitative features of qcd in the strongly coupled regime .",
    "one of the renowned works is the universal lower bound of the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density found in the holographic model @xcite .",
    "although the ideal hydrodynamics successfully describes many properties of qgp based on experimental data , further studies propose that the medium should be anisotropic in the early times during the formation of qgp @xcite . within the time period @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the saturation scale of colliding nuclei , the pressure of the medium along the transverse direction ( perpendicular to the beam axis ) may surpass the pressure along the longitudinal direction ( parallel to the beam axis ) .",
    "moreover , the recent study on the thermalization of a strongly coupled plasma via ads / cft correspondence suggests an anisotropic medium even in the late times @xcite .",
    "the authors examined a wide variety of initial conditions and found all setups lead to anisotropic hydrodynamics after the thermalization .",
    "therefore , at least withing a certain time period , qgp could be dictated by anisotropic hydrodynamics with unequal pressures along distinct directions . despite the spacial expansion of qgp with respect to time ,",
    "the investigation of a static yet anisotropic plasma may shed some light on the physics in early times . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the dual geometries of such a strongly coupled and static plasma with anisotropy are derived .",
    "the former is originated from solely the anisotropic energy stress tensor , while the spacetime has a naked singularity .",
    "the latter is generated from a five - dimensional effective action with a dilaton and an axion field linearly depending on an anisotropic factor , which results in a regular geometry .",
    "the further study of a static and anisotropic plasma with finite chemical potentials can be found in @xcite .",
    "the energy loss of hard probes in such strongly - coupled anisotropic plasma described by holographic models has been investigated recently .",
    "the energy loss of heavy probes in the gravity dual can be characterized by the drag force obtained from a trailing string moving in the dual geometry @xcite or the jet quenching parameter extracted from a lightcone wilson loop probing the infrared scale @xcite .",
    "the jet quenching parameter , drag force as well as the heavy quark potential are computed in holographic duals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy loss of orbiting quarks and quarkonium dissociation in an anisotropic holographic dual also have been explored in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is found in @xcite that the drag force in the anisotropic plasma can be smaller or larger than the isotropic case depending on different velocities and orientations of the probes . on the other hand ,",
    "the anisotropic value of the jet quenching parameter may be enhanced or reduced when comparing to the isotropic value at equal temperature or at equal entropy density @xcite .",
    "these studies focus on the jet quenching of heavy probes in the gravity dual , whereas the anisotropic effect on light probes has not yet been investigated . in the isotropic case",
    ", the jet quenching of light probes can be characterized by a maximum stopping distance of a massless particle falling along the null geodesic in the dual geometry based on various approaches @xcite .",
    "we will thus carry out the computation of the stopping distance in the anisotropic dual geometry introduced from @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we will compute the stopping distance of a light probe at small anisotropy or equivalently at high temperature by tracking a massless particle falling in the anisotropic geometry up to the leading - order expansion of the ratio of anisotropic factor over temperature .",
    "we then present the numerical results of stopping distances at mid and large anisotropy in section iii and make a brief summary in the final section .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the maximum stopping distance of a light probe in an anisotropic plasma at the high - temperature or the small - anisotropy regime . in @xcite , mateos and trancanelli(mt ) introduced a five - dimensional dilaton - axion action , which leads to an anisotropic solution of the spacetime metric . in the string frame ,",
    "the solution is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the transverse direction and the longitudinal direction , respective .",
    "the metric is generated by a dilaton @xmath9 and an axion @xmath10 encoding the anisotropic factor @xmath11 , where @xmath11 represents the number density of d7-branes along the longitudinal direction as a magnetic source of the axion . in heavy ion collisions",
    ", the longitudinal direction could be regarded as the beam direction .",
    "the nonzero anisotropic factor gives rise to the pressure difference between the directions parallel and perpendicular to beams .",
    "thus , the dual geometry may mimic a boost invariant medium along the beam direction without expansion .    in the high - temperature or the small - anisotropy regime @xmath12 ,",
    "the pressure anisotropy is small . in this regime ,",

    "we will follow the approach in @xcite , where an r - charged current is generated by a massless gauge field in the gravity dual",

    "is filled with a d7 brane , where the backreaction of the d7 brane to the bulk geometry is ignored .",
    "a string falling in the bulk then induces a flavor - current on the boundary , which can be regarded as a light quark traversing the medium .",
    "notice that the flavor d7 brane here is different from the d7 brane in mt model as the source of anisotropy .",
    "when the tip of the string falls into the horizon , the flavor current fully diffuses on the boundary , which corresponds to the thermalization of a light quark in the medium . in this scenario , a null geodesic will result in the maximum stopping distance for the light quark , which is similar to the previous setup for an r - charged current .    by using ( [ geodesic ] ) , the stopping distance in an isotropic medium governed by the ads - schwarzschild spacetime",
    "is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the position of the event horizon . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the energy and the spacial momentum of the particle , respectively .",
    "analogously , by employing ( [ mt ] ) and ( [ geodesic ] ) , we can compute the stopping distances of the probes traveling along the transverse and the longitudinal directions in the anisotropic medium , @xmath40 where we assume that the particle carries the spatial momentum solely along one of the transverse direction in ( [ xt ] ) and solely along the longitudinal direction in ( [ xl ] ) . in this computation ,",
    "the null geodesic in ( [ geodesic ] ) remains unchanged even when we use the einstein frame .    to compare the stopping distance in the media with and without the anisotropic effect",
    ", we have to fix a proper physical parameter . in the following computation",
    ", we will fix the temperature , energy density , and entropy density , respectively .",
    "the recent lattice simulation for the @xmath1 plasma at finite temperature within the range of rhic and lhc has shown that the equilibrium thermodynamic properties have mild dependence of @xmath3 @xcite , which supports the validity of the study of qcd based on large @xmath3 models .",

    ", we will always take @xmath41 in analogy to qcd , while the choice of @xmath3 will not affect our qualitative results in this paper . from ( [ xt ] ) and ( [ xl ] ) , we see that the parameter - dependence of the stopping distance is encoded by the position of the horizon in terms of the physical parameter we fix . by inserting ( [ zhorizon ] ) into ( [ xt ] ) and ( [ xl ] ) , we can compute the stopping distance by fixing the temperature of the medium .",
    "the stopping distances for different values of the anisotropy factor @xmath11 in units of temperature are illustrated in fig.[mtplot ] . in @xcite , the energy density and entropy density up to leading order in @xmath42",
    "are given by @xmath43 combining ( [ zhorizon ] ) and ( [ density ] ) , we rewrite the position of the horizon in terms of the energy density or the entropy density , @xmath44 by utilizing ( [ xt ] ) , ( [ xl ] ) , and ( [ zhorizond ] ) , we are now able to compute the stopping distances for fixed energy density or fixed entropy density .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fixe ] and fig.[fixs ] .",
    "we find that the nonzero anisotropic factor leads to smaller stopping distances in both the transverse direction and the longitudinal direction , which indicates stronger jet quenching of light probes traveling through the anisotropic medium .",
    "the quenching is more pronounced along the longitudinal direction .",
    "although this effect is rather small , it is not surprising since the momentum anisotropy for @xmath45 is rather small as shown in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to light probes , the jet quenching of heavy probes is also weakly enhanced at small anisotropy or at high temperature .",
    "as shown in @xcite , only slightly greater jet quenching parameters and drag forces of heavy probes moving beyond the critical velocity are found in the mt geometry at @xmath46 .",
    "we now analyze the relation between the energy density and the stopping distance in the anisotropic plasma in more detail . in the ads - schwarzschild spacetime",
    ", the energy density is characterized by the temperature , @xmath47 . by using ( [ xstop ] )",
    ", the stopping distance can be rewritten as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the integral and @xmath51 is a dimensionless factor .",
    "we see that the stopping distance of the hard probe decreases when the energy density is increased .",
    "this is analogous to the weakly - coupled plasma where the jet quenching is enhanced for increasing energy density @xcite .",
    "when including the anisotropic effect , the transverse stopping distance to the order @xmath42 becomes @xmath52\\\\ & = & \\epsilon_a^{-1/4}a_0(n_c,\\omega,|\\vec{q}|)+a^2\\epsilon_a^{-3/4}a_1^t(n_c,\\omega,|\\vec{q}|),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be read off from ( [ zhorizond ] ) . here",
    "@xmath55 is the energy density shown in ( [ density ] ) and we may take @xmath56 for comparison .",
    "for the hard probe with small virtuality , the dimensionless factor @xmath57 is negative ; hence the suppression of the stopping distance led by the first - order anisotropic correction is reduced when the energy density is increased .",
    "the longitudinal stopping distance @xmath58 can be written in the same form as @xmath59 by substituting @xmath57 with a different numerical factor @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is also negative at small virtuality .",
    "the similar scenario for fixed entropy density could be found by following the same approach .    in general , in the high - temperature or small - anisotropy limit , the anisotropic values of stopping distances are slightly smaller than the isotropic values by fixing one of physical parameters such as temperature , energy density , or entropy density .",
    "the jet quenching along the longitudinal direction is particularly enhanced , although the enhancement is rather small",

    "in the mid - anisotropy or the large - anisotropy regimes , the longitudinal pressure surpasses the transverse pressure and the pressure inequality becomes substantial @xcite , which may not be similar to the feature of qgp . in anisotropic hydrodynamics ,",
    "the pressure difference can be considerably large in early times @xcite .",
    "however , the longitudinal pressure should be always suppressed by the transverse pressure , which is qualitatively opposite to the scenario described by the mt model beyond small anisotropy . despite the unrealistic directions of anisotropy",
    ", it may be heuristic to investigate the effect of the medium with strong anisotropy on jet quenching of light probes .",
    "to study the jet quenching in the mid - anisotropy or the large - anisotropy regimes , we have to employ the numerical solution of the mt metric .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the spacetime metric is derived from solving the einstein equations and the dilaton equation with the only restriction @xmath21 by taking the following expansion , @xmath64 where @xmath65 . by fixing @xmath66",
    ", the anisotropic factor will be determined by @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical result of the metric should only depend on the values of @xmath68 and @xmath20 .",
    "the full expressions of the temperature and entropy density are @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "here we are interested in the stopping distance along an arbitrary direction .",
    "due to the rotational symmetry in the transverse directions , we may set the four - momentum of the massless particle as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the polar angle in the @xmath73 plane with respect to the longitudinal direction @xmath74 .",
    "the probe thus travels along the longitudinal and transverse directions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "now the stopping distance acquired from ( [ geodesic ] ) is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 by inserting the numerical solutions of the spacetime metric into the equation above and carrying out the integrations , the stopping distances at mid and large anisotropy in comparison with those in the isotropic case are shown in fig.[xrpsi1 ] and fig.[xrpsi3 ] .",
    "when fixing the temperature , the stopping distances in both mid and large anisotropy are smaller compared to the isotropic results .",
    "as shown in both figures , when @xmath72 decreases , the suppression of the stopping distance becomes more robust , which suggests stronger jet quenching along the longitudinal direction .",
    "in contrast , at equal entropy density , the enhanced jet quenching in the anisotropic medium becomes less prominent and the stopping distances of probes moving close to the transverse directions even exceed the stopping distances in the isotropic case .",
    "overall , the jet quenching of light probes is enhanced when turning up the anisotropic effect except for the probe moving along the transverse direction .    after finding the results at mid and large anisotropy ,",
    "we may make a comparison with the influence of the anisotropic effect on the jet quenching of heavy probes . in the studies of the drag force in mt metric @xcite ,",
    "the longitudinal drag is as well enhanced by anisotropy at equal temperature or at equal entropy density .",
    "also , at mid or large anisotropy , the enhancement of the drag force for the probe traveling more parallel to the transverse direction diminishes . when the magnitude of the probe velocity is smaller than a critical value , the transverse drag could be smaller than the isotropic drag at equal temperature or equal entropy density . despite the velocity dependence ,",
    "the angular dependence of the anisotropic drag is qualitatively analogous to the scenario of the anisotropic stopping distance we find . for the jet quenching parameter computed from lightcone wilson loops , the enhancement or the suppression due to anisotropy",
    "are more subtle , which depends on both the direction of moving quarks and the direction of momentum broadening @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "since the momentum broadening is attributed to collisions between the heavy quark and thermal partons in the medium , this effect should be suppressed compared to the radiation energy loss in the case of light probes . as a result",
    ", we may not anticipate that the anisotropy effect on stopping distances of light probes shares the same features with the jet quenching parameters .     at large anisotropy at equal temperature and at equal entropy density , respectively . here",
    "we take @xmath63 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 or equivalently @xmath81 for @xmath41.,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=188 ]     at large anisotropy at equal temperature and at equal entropy density , respectively . here",
