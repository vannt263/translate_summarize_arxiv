    "the measurement of an accurate energy spectrum could further help to reduce the amount of possible models as well as a more precise location of the emission region ; both goals require a measurement with higher event statistics as currently available by the h.e.s.s .",

    "simultaneous observations at other wavelengths  especially in x - rays , such as the chandra monitoring of the hst-1 knot in the inner jet region @xcite  are of great importance since a correlation would further reveal the tev @xmath1-ray production mechanism of this agn which is the first one not belonging to the blazar class .",
