    "the description of quantum mechanical systems by means of the schrdinger equation has been developed more than 80 years ago . at that time",
    "only a few resonance states in nuclei and atoms were known which are well separated from one another .",
    "the energies of these states are well described by means of the schrdinger equation with a hermitian hamiltonian . in order to describe the finite lifetimes of these states ,",
    "the r - matrix theory has been developed which is however too complicated for practical calculations .",
    "the finite lifetimes of the individual states are calculated usually perturbatively , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "later , systems at high level density were in the center of interest .",
    "under these conditions , a statistical description of the system turned out to be very efficient @xcite .",
    "the resonances are well isolated from one another , and the lifetimes of the states are very long and do not play any role .    in the course of time , experimental studies have been performed for different quantum systems with a much improved accuracy . also the theoretical calculations are carried out today not only for states being well separated in energy from one another but also for resonance states in the regime of overlapping . here",
    "the single individual states can no longer be identified what results in problems of their interpretation .",
    "contradictions between experimental results and conventional hermitian quantum physics appeared in different small quantum systems .",
    "for example , heiblum et al .",
    "@xcite found experimentally a crossover from the mesoscopic to a universal phase for electron transmission in quantum dots about than 10 years ago .",
    "these results could not be explained in conventional quantum physics in spite of much effort @xcite . recently",
    "koehler et al .",
    "@xcite observed that neutron resonance data exclude random matrix theory .",
    "deviations between experimental data and random matrix theory in nuclear physics studies were observed also earlier , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these and other experimental results show that the schrdinger equation originally introduced with a hermitian hamilton operator for the description of well isolated resonances , has to be extended . above all , the lifetimes of the resonance states have to be calculated also in the regime of overlapping resonances and the justification of statistical assumptions has to be proven for small quantum systems .",
    "the lifetimes of the resonance states can be calculated when the system is explicitly considered to be open and the calculations are performed quantum mechanically for both the system and the environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded . using the feshbach projection operator technique @xcite , first the _ energy - independent _ many - body problem of the system ( with the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath4 ) is solved in the standard manner .",
    "these solutions provide the energies @xmath5 and wavefunctions @xmath6 of the discrete states with inclusion of the so - called _ internal _ interaction . in a second step ,",
    "the _ energy - dependent _ scattering wavefunctions @xmath7 of the environment are calculated and , further , the ( energy - dependent ) coupling matrix elements @xmath8 between the discrete states of the system and the environment are evaluated ( see @xcite , section 2.1 ) .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation contains an energy dependent ( nonlinear ) source term describing the coupling between system and environment .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 of this equation is non - hermitian and provides the lifetimes of the states , but without any additional interaction of the states via the environment .",
    "the schrdinger equation with @xmath9 and source term can be rewritten into a schrdinger equation without source term but with a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath10 that contains the interaction of the states via the environment ( the so - called _ external _ interaction ) in the nondiagonal matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath11 reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the coupling between system and environment and @xmath15 is the green function in the subspace of scattering states .",
    "the external interaction of the states via the continuum is complex , generally .",
    "the principal value integral is @xmath16 and the residuum reads @xmath17 the interaction of the states of the system via the environment is involved in the eigenvalues @xmath18 and eigenfunctions @xmath19 of the hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "it is therefore relatively easy , in this formalism , to study the influence of the environment onto the states of the system .",
    "that means , the non - hermitian quantum physics is  in contrast to the widely spread meaning  _ not _ a further approximation introduced in the theory .",
    "it is an expression of the fact that the system considered is really open and its properties are influenced by the coupling to the environment .",
    "this influence is unimportant at low level density where it can be described by perturbation theory .",
    "it becomes , however , decisive in the regime of overlapping resonances .",
    "meanwhile , many calculations for open quantum systems are performed with high accuracy . without using any perturbation theory or statistical assumptions , the schrdinger equation with the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath10",
    "is solved and the eigenvalues @xmath20 and eigenfunctions @xmath19 are obtained .",
    "that means , not only the energies @xmath21 of the states of the system are evaluated but also their lifetimes @xmath22 .",
    "the control of the eigenvalues by a parameter allows to draw conclusions on the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "the limits of the applicability of the standard quantum theory with hermitian hamilton operator can be seen best at high level density , where the individual resonance states overlap and interact with one another via the continuum of scattering wavefunctions . here , the dynamics of the system is determined by singular points , the so - called _",
    "exceptional points_. they cause level repulsion in energy as well as a bifurcation of the widths ( inverse proportional to the lifetimes ) of the states .",
    "results are obtained theoretically as well as experimentally , which are counterintuitive at first glance : due to width bifurcation , coherent short - lived states are formed together with states that are almost decoupled from the continuum of scattering states @xcite .",
    "an example is the above - mentioned crossover from the mesoscopic to a universal phase in the transmission in quantum dots @xcite and its qualitative explanation on the basis of a schrdinger equation with non - hermitian hamilton operator @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in different systems and is called usually _ dynamical phase transition _ @xcite .",
    "the short - lived states are analog to the coherent superradiant states considered by dicke @xcite in 1954 as shown by means of a toy model @xcite .",
    "moreover , it could be shown in an experiment on non - locally coupled pairs of quantum point contacts that discrete states undergo a robust interaction that is achieved by coupling them to each other through the continuum @xcite .",
    "most of these results are of high value for fundamental questions of quantum mechanics as well as for applications .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to show some generic ( mostly numerical ) results for open quantum systems in order to receive a deeper understanding for the dynamical phase transitions occurring in the regime of overlapping resonances .",
    "a toy model is used in order to receive conclusions on the role played by exceptional points and avoided level crossings at high level density in open quantum systems .",
    "of special interest are the effects arising from the imaginary part ( [ form12 ] ) of the coupling term via the environment .",
    "the calculations are performed with respectively two , four and ten resonance states coupled mostly to one open decay channel ( corresponding to the common continuum of scattering wavefunctions ) under the condition that they avoid crossing or even cross in a certain parameter range .",
    "the coupling of @xmath23 resonance states to @xmath24 channels corresponds to the general situation of open quantum systems .",
    "the formalism used in the calculations is the same as that discussed in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the results show very clearly that the imaginary part of the coupling term between system and environment causes width bifurcation and , finally , the formation of different time scales in the regime of overlapping resonances . due to width bifurcation ,",
    "the system splits into two parts that exist at different times .",
    "this process is irreversible .",
    "the wavefunctions of the short - lived _ aligned _ states are mixed coherently in relation to the open decay channel while those of the long - lived _ trapped _ states are mixed incoherently such that the states are almost decoupled from the open decay channel .",
    "the results confirm the characteristic features of the dynamical phase transitions appearing in open quantum systems at high level density .",
    "they show that the number of states of the system is reduced during the dynamical phase transition due to ejecting the aligned short - lived state and , furthermore , that the wavefunctions of the states before and beyond the dynamical phase transition are completely different from one another .",
    "while the states of the original system ( without interaction via the continuum ) have individual spectroscopic features , those of the system consisting of the long - lived states beyond the dynamical phase transition show chaotic features .",
    "these results prove once more that the experimental results @xcite on the crossover from the mesoscopic to a universal phase for electron transmission in quantum dots can be explained by means of the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "additionally it should be mentioned here that the aligned state corresponds to the dicke superradiant state and the trapped states to the subradiant states which are considered in optics , e.g. @xcite .    in section [ form ] , we sketch the formalism used in the present calculations . for @xmath25 states with equal decay widths ,",
    "the analytical and numerical solutions of the problem show clearly the effect of width bifurcation .",
    "numerical results for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained for @xmath25 , 4 and 10 states are provided in sections [ 2 ] to [ v10 ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ disc ] while conclusions on the relation between exceptional points and width bifurcation are drawn in the last section [ concl ] .",
    "we consider an @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 the diagonal elements of which are the @xmath23 complex eigenvalues @xmath28 of a non - hermitian operator .",
    "the @xmath29 are the so - called selfenergies of the states arising from their coupling to the environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded . in atomic physics , these values are known as lamb shift .",
    "our calculations are performed with coupling matrix elements @xmath29 the values of which do not depend on the parameter considered . in such a case , the @xmath29 can considered to be included into the diagonal matrix elements , which read @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the energies and widths , respectively , of the @xmath23 states ( including their selfenergies ) without account of the interaction of the different states via the environment .",
    "the internal interaction of the two states @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( appearing in the closed system ) _ as well as _ their external interaction ( via the environment ) are contained in the @xmath35 .",
    "the internal interaction can be caused only by some part of re@xmath36 while the external interaction contains complex @xmath35 , see equations ( [ form11 ] ) and ( [ form12 ] ) .",
    "most interesting part of the external interaction is therefore im@xmath36 .",
    "it becomes important at high level density where the corresponding resonance states overlap .    when the number @xmath23 of states is equal to the number @xmath37 of common channels ( i.e. equal to the number @xmath37 of different common continua of scattering wavefunctions ) all the coupling matrix elements @xmath35 are different from zero and the matrix ( [ form1 ] ) is full . in the case with only one open decay channel @xmath38 ,",
    "all @xmath35 different from @xmath39 and @xmath40 are zero .",
    "an example of @xmath41 states coupled to only the fourth channel is the following matrix @xmath42 with @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "these results show the strong influence of external parameters onto the dynamics of the system at high level density which is known from the study of realistic cases .",
    "an example is the enhanced transmission through microwave cavities when the formation of whispering gallery modes is supported by the manner the leads are attached to the cavity @xcite .",
    "width bifurcation is directly related to the _ alignment _ of one of the @xmath23 resonance states of the open quantum system to a decay channel ( @xmath38 ) with the consequence that it becomes short - lived while other states become _ trapped _ ( long - lived ) , i.e. more or less decoupled from the environment .",
    "mathematically , the alignment of a resonance state is possible since the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator are biorthogonal and their phases ( relative to those of the eigenfunctions of the other states ) are not rigid in approaching an exceptional point , see equation ( [ eif11 ] ) .",
    "width bifurcation appears therefore in our calculations when @xmath38 and @xmath41 or 10 .",
    "this corresponds to realistic situations in which usually @xmath24 .",
    "width bifurcation does , however , not appear when @xmath41 states are coupled to @xmath133 channels ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) although the wavefunctions are strongly mixed in the critical parameter region also in this case ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "an artifact of our model calculations is the assumption of equidistant energies @xmath31 of all but one state which are crossed by one state the energy of which depends linearly on the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the critical points are symmetrically in relation to the two neighboring states , and @xmath180 states do not contribute actively to the width bifurcation taking place in the whole system . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show results obtained when the symmetry is somewhat disturbed ( as it is usually the case in realistic systems ) . in such a case , the width of one state separates from those of _ all _ the other states .",
    "that means , all nine states remain trapped ( decoupled ) in the whole critical parameter range .",
    "this result corresponds to results obtained theoretically as well as experimentally in different realistic systems ( see section 4 in the review @xcite ) .",
    "it should be added here , that asymptotically ( beyond the critical parameter region ) the states can be exchanged at most . this is the case , indeed , in all our calculations .",
    "all redistribution processes caused by the exceptional points take place only in the critical parameter region .",
    "this holds true for real as well as for imaginary coupling coefficients @xmath94 and can be seen also in the mixing coefficients @xmath96 which approach 1 or 0 when @xmath178 and @xmath155 , respectively , beyond the critical parameter region .",
    "the two cases with real and imaginary @xmath0 differ , however , by the length of the critical region .",
    "the results of the present paper show that exceptional points cause width bifurcation because the coupling of the states via the environment ( continuum of scattering wavefunctions ) is complex .",
    "an example are the bound states in the continuum appearing at a",
    "_ finite _ value of the coupling strength between system and environment when the interplay between internal and external interaction is taken into account , see section 4.4 of the review @xcite . of particular interest",
    "is the width bifurcation appearing at high level density . here",
    ", many exceptional points are near to one another .",
    "as shown in the present paper , width bifurcation causes , under this condition , a splitting of the system into two parts one of which exists in the short - time scale while the other one appears in the long - time scale .",
    "the two parts can not be observed together .",
    "the long - lived states occur as fluctuations in the short - time scale while the short - lived states perform a smooth background in the long - time scale .",
    "this phenomenon is known in literature from theoretical as well as experimental studies on different small quantum systems and systems equivalent to them ( see examples in the review @xcite and in @xcite ) . in many - body open quantum systems ,",
    "it is called mostly _ dynamical phase transition_. it is known also in optics where it is called _ superradiant phase transition _ according to dicke @xcite . in pt - symmetric systems ,",
    "the phase transition is called mostly _ pt - symmetry breaking _ @xcite .",
    "common to all these studies is that the dynamical phase transition is very robust when the necessary conditions are fulfilled , i.e. when the level density is high and the dynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points . although the existence of exceptional points is decisive ( as shown in the present paper ) , the dynamical phase transition does _ not _ appear at the parameter value which gives the position of the exceptional point itself .",
    "instead , the phase transition occurs in the neighborhood of one ( or several ) exceptional points .",
    "such a result is known from different experimental studies on concrete realistic systems .",
    "it is discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper show that the critical parameter range is determined by the distance between ( at least ) two exceptional points .",
    "the dynamical phase transition appearing in small quantum systems at high level density , causes a new understanding of time as discussed in @xcite .",
    "time which is characteristic of the system , is inverse proportional to the widths @xmath47 and related therefore directly to the non - hermitian part of the hamilton operator .",
    "the widths do not increase limitless as shown in the present paper .",
    "instead , the system is dynamically stabilized : the lifetimes of the states of the system are increased and the system as a whole is stabilized by ejecting the short - lived state from the system at the dynamical phase transition .",
    "thus , the time characteristic of the system is bounded from below in a similar manner as the energy . beyond the dynamical phase transition ,",
    "all states have lost their original spectroscopic features and the number of states is reduced .",
    "this fact is very well known in nuclear physics ( although very seldom interpreted in this manner ) .",
    "the properties of compound nuclei are described well by the _ unified theory of nuclear reactions _ developed by feshbach @xcite , which contains both the short - lived direct reaction part and the long - lived compound nuclear reaction part .",
    "however , feshbach introduces statistical assumptions in order to describe the long - lived compound nuclear states .",
    "this is in contrast to the calculations in the present paper where the long - lived states are described _ without _ any statistical assumptions .",
    "instead the long - lived states are shown by us to arise from width bifurcation causing a dynamical stabilization of the system at high level density , a phenomenon that is caused by exceptional points .",
    "many of these results seem to be counterintuitive .",
    "they allow us , however , to explain some unexpected experimental results .",
    "for example , the crossover from the mesoscopic to a universal phase for transmission in quantum dots observed experimentally @xcite can be explained qualitatively by the formation of the short - lived resonance state at the dynamical phase transition .",
    "the results of the present paper support this interpretation @xcite of the experimental results .",
    "another example is the experimental observation @xcite of non - statistical effects in nuclear reactions on middle - heavy nuclei .",
    "the data show directly the formation of different time scales in the system at high level density .",
    "other examples are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the long - lived states beyond the dynamical phase transition are strongly mixed and show chaotic features .",
    "the random matrix theory is surely applicable only after averaging over different decay channels ( as usually done ) , i.e. it is not applicable to the description of small systems coupled to one channel ( and , respectively , to two channels in the case of transmission through the system ) . a theoretical analysis of the spectra ( without any statistical assumptions ) by restricting to the results obtained from one decay channel according to the recent experimental data on compound nuclei @xcite",
    "is not performed up to now . on the basis of the results of the present paper ,",
    "it can be stated today only the following .",
    "the mixing of the long - lived states ( beyond the dynamical phase transition ) is caused by complex many - body forces via the continuum of scattering wavefunctions ( simulated by the @xmath94 in our calculations ) and not by two - body forces .",
    "this may provide an explanation of the fact why compound nucleus spectra ( after averaging over different channels and beyond decay thresholds ) may be described by a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( containing many - body forces ) , but not by a two - body random ensemble .",
    "this point should be studied in future in more detail .    in order to prove the role of exceptional points in an open many - level quantum system",
    "it is highly interesting to study experimentally time symmetry breaking caused by the influence of a nearby state onto an exceptional point .",
    "theoretical studies with a symmetrical influence ( as in most calculations of the present paper ) can surely not describe the properties of realistic systems with broken time symmetry .",
    "symmetry breaking influences not only width bifurcation ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) but will prove , above all , the irreversible processes caused by exceptional points in open quantum systems .",
    "these processes are decisive , among others , for the dynamical stabilization of quantum systems and the formation of quantum chaos .",
    "finally we remark that the sensitive dependence of the dynamics of an open quantum system on the value of external parameters ( as shown in the present paper ) can be used in order to construct small systems with desired properties .",
    "this point is important for applications .",

    "<S> the states of an open quantum system are coupled via the environment of scattering wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the complex coupling coefficients @xmath0 between system and environment arise from the principal value integral and the residuum . at high level density where the resonance states overlap , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points . at these points , </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of two states are equal and the corresponding eigenfunctions are linearly dependent . it is shown in the present paper that im@xmath1 and re@xmath1 influence the system properties differently in the surrounding of exceptional points . controlling the system by a parameter </S>",
    "<S> , the eigenvalues avoid crossing in energy near an exceptional point under the influence of re@xmath1 in a similar manner as it is well known from discrete states . </S>",
    "<S> im@xmath1 however leads to width bifurcation and finally ( when the system is coupled to one channel , i.e. to a common continuum of scattering wavefunctions ) , to a splitting of the system into two parts with different characteristic time scales . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the system is stabilized by this splitting since the lifetimes of most ( @xmath2 ) states are longer than before while that of only one state is shorter . in the cross section </S>",
    "<S> the short - lived state appears as a background term in high - resolution experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions of the long - lived states are mixed in those of the original ones in a comparably large parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are shown for @xmath3 and 10 states coupled mostly to 1 channel . </S>"
