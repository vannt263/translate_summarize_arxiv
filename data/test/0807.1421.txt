    "in 1960 l.d .  faddeev formulated his mathematically rigorous scattering theory for three particles by proposing a set of three coupled integral equations , which do have a unique solution  @xcite . in the first numerical realizations of this approach ,",
    "separable interactions were introduced , reducing the three - body equations to a set of one - dimensional coupled integral equations , whose numerical solutions was feasible at the time  @xcite . despite a simplification due to the choice of the two - body interaction , the standard formulation of the momentum space faddeev equations in the continuum contains for the free three - body propagator a complicated singularity structure within the integral kernel  @xcite .",
    "these complications arise because the position of the propagator cut does not only depend on the total energy of the system but also on external momentum variables on a grid ( thus the term moving singularities ) .",
    "in addition branch points occur leading to logarithmic singularities .",
    "it is possible to carry out the integration along a path in the complex plane , thus avoiding to directly deal with these singularities , but indirectly imposing conditions on the analytical properties of the two - body force .",
    "this method of contour deformation was introduced for separable potentials by hetherington and schick  @xcite and perfected by cahill and sloan  @xcite .",
    "the need to use realistic forces , which are predominantly local , led to methods integrating the singularities on the real momentum axis  @xcite .",
    "it took until the 1980 s until the faddeev equations were solved in the continuum with a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force as input  @xcite .    during the last two decades calculations of nucleon - deuteron scattering experienced large improvements and refinements .",
    "it is fair to say that below about the pion production projectile energy the momentum space faddeev equations for three - nucleon scattering can now be solved with high accuracy for the most modern two- and three - nucleon forces .",
    "a summary of these achievements can be found in refs .",
    "the approach described there is based on using angular momentum eigenstates for the two- and three - body systems .",
    "this partial wave decomposition replaces the continuous angle variables by discrete orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , and thus reduces the number of continuous variables to be discretized in a numerical treatment to two . for low projectile energies the procedure of considering orbital angular momentum components",
    "appears physically justified due to arguments related to the centrifugal barrier and the short range of the nuclear force . however ,",
    "when considering three nucleon scattering at higher energies , it appears natural to avoid a partial wave representation completely and work directly with vector variables .",
    "only recently exact faddeev calculations for three - body scattering in the intermediate energy regime became available .",
    "the formulation and numerical realization based on vector variables for the nonrelativistic faddeev equations  @xcite as well as fully poincar invariant ones  @xcite have been carried out for scalar interactions up to projectile energies of 2  gev .    despite the technical sophistication with which the faddeev equations in the continuum are solved today , the treatment of the singularity structure of the free three - nucleon propagator experienced only minor modifications from the original suggestion  @xcite , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite the logarithmic singularities are integrated semi - analytically with splines in contrast to the earlier subtraction techniques .",
    "however , it would be most desirable to have a kernel without any logarithmic singularities . in ref .",
    "@xcite a solution to this long lasting technical challenge is proposed and successfully carried out in the context of the partial wave decomposed faddeev equations .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine this suggestion in the context of a three - dimensional treatment of the faddeev equation and introduce a kernel in which only simple poles in one variable occur .",
    "those poles can than be integrated by standard subtraction techniques .    in section ii we briefly revisit the form of the nonrelativistic faddeev equation used in previous work  @xcite to allow an easy comparison of the differences in our new approach . in section iii",
    "we describe in detail the simplification of the singularity structure of the free three - body propagator , and in section iv we complete the calculation with the remaining angular integrations and connect to previous work in calculating the operators for elastic and breakup scattering .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "there are various presentations of three - body scattering in the faddeev scheme  @xcite presented in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the faddeev equation for identical particles in the form @xmath0 the driving term of this integral equation consists of a two - body t - matrix @xmath1 , the sum @xmath2 of a cyclic and anticyclic permutation of three identical particles , and the initial state @xmath3 , composed of a two - body bound state and the momentum eigenstate of the projectile particle .",
