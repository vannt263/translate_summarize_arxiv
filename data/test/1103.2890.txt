    "being related to almost all stable elementary particles such as proton , electron and neutrino , spinor field , especially dirac spin-@xmath1 play a principal role at the microlevel . however ,",
    "in cosmology , the role of spinor field was generally considered to be restricted . only recently , after some remarkable works by different authors ( e.g. , henneaux , 1980 ; saha , 2001a , 2004a , 2004b , 2006c , 2006d ; armend@xmath2riz - pic@xmath3n and greene , 2003 ; ribas _ et al _ , 2005 ; souza and kremer , 2008 ) , showing the important role that spinor fields play on the evolution of the universe , the situation began to change .",
    "this change of attitude is directly related to some fundamental questions of modern cosmology : ( i ) problem of initial singularity ; ( ii ) problem of isotropization and ( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe .    *",
    "( i ) problem of initial singularity : * one of the problems of modern cosmology is the presence of initial singularity , which means the finiteness of time .",
    "the main purpose of introducing a nonlinear term in the spinor field lagrangian is to study the possibility of the elimination of initial singularity . in a number of papers",
    "it was shown that the introduction of nonlinear spinor field into the system indeed gives rise to singularity - free models of the universe ( saha , 2001a , 2001b , 2004a ) , ( saha and shikin , 1997a , 1997b ) .    *",
    "( ii ) problem of isotropization : * although the universe seems homogenous and isotropic at present , it does not necessarily mean that it is also suitable for a description of the early stages of the development of the universe and there are no observational data guaranteeing the isotropy in the era prior to the recombination .",
    "in fact , there are theoretical arguments that support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one ( misner 1968 ) .",
    "the observations from cosmic background explorer s differential radiometer have detected and measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies in different angular scales .",
    "these anisotropies are supposed to hide in their fold the entire history of cosmic evolution dating back to the recombination era and are being considered as indicative of the geometry and the content of the universe .",
    "more about cosmic microwave background anisotropy is expected to be uncovered by the investigations of microwave anisotropy probe .",
    "there is widespread consensus among the cosmologists that cosmic microwave background anisotropies in small angular scales have the key to the formation of discrete structure .",
    "it was found that the introduction of nonlinear spinor field accelerates the isotropization process of the initially anisotropic universe ( saha , 2001a , 2004a , 2006c ) .    *",
    "( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe : * detection and further experimental reconfirmation of current cosmic acceleration pose to cosmology a fundamental task of identifying and revealing the cause of such phenomenon .",
    "this fact can be reconciled with the theory if one assumes that the universe i d mostly filled with so - called dark energy .",
    "this form of matter ( energy ) is not observable in laboratory and it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "these facts played decisive role in naming this object .",
    "in contrast to dark matter , dark energy is uniformly distributed over the space , does not intertwine under the influence of gravity in all scales and it has a strong negative pressure of the order of energy density . based on these properties ,",
    "cosmologists have suggested a number of dark energy models , those are able to explain the current accelerated phase of expansion of the universe . in this connection",
    "a series of papers appeared recently in the literature , where a spinor field was considered as an alternative model for dark energy ( ribas _ et al _ , 2005 ; saha , 2006d , 2006e , 2007 ) .",
    "it should be noted that most of the works mentioned above were carried out within the scope of bianchi type - i cosmological model .",
    "results obtained using a spinor field as a source of bianchi type - i cosmological field can be summed up as follows : a suitable choice of spinor field nonlinearity + ( i ) _ accelerates the isotropization process _ ( saha , 2001a , 2004a , 2006c ) ; + ( ii ) _ gives rise to a singularity - free universe _",
    "( saha , 2001a , 2004a , 2004b , 2006c ) ; + ( iii ) _ generates late time acceleration _ ( ribas _ et al _ , 2005 ; saha , 2006d ; souza and kremer , 2008 ) .",
    "given the role that spinor field can play in the evolution of the universe , question that naturally pops up is , if the spinor field can redraw the picture of evolution caused by perfect fluid and dark energy , is it possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a spinor field ?",
    "affirmative answer to this question was given in the a number of papers ( krechet _ et al _ , 2008 ; saha , 2010a , 2010b ) . in those papers",
    "the authors have shown that different types of perfect fluid and dark energy can be described by nonlinear spinor field . in ( saha , 2010a )",
    "we used two types of nonlinearity , one occurs as a result of self - action and the other resulted from the interaction between the spinor and scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the case with induced nonlinearity is the partial one and can be derived from the case with self - action . in ( saha ,",
    "2010b , 2011 ) we give the description of generalized chaplygin gas and modified quintessence in terms of spinor field and study the evolution of the universe filled with nonlinear spinor field within the scope of a bianchi type - i and frw cosmological model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend that study within the framework of other bianchi models .",
    "nonlinear quantum dirac fields were used by heisenberg ( 1953 , 1957 ) in his ambitious unified theory of elementary particles .",
    "they are presently the object of renewed interest since the widely known paper by gross and neveu ( 1974 ) . a nonlinear spinor field ,",
    "suggested by the symmetric coupling between nucleons , muons , and leptons , has been investigated by finkelstein _",
    "et al . _ ( 1951 ) in the classical approximation .    in this section",
    "we simulate different types of perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a nonlinear spinor field .      for a spinor field @xmath4",
    ", the symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath5 appears to demand that one should choose the symmetrized lagrangian ( kibble , 1961 ) . keeping this in mind we choose the spinor field lagrangian as ( saha , 2001a ) : @xmath6 - m_{\\rm sp}{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + f , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear term @xmath7 describes the self - action of a spinor field and",
    "can be presented as some arbitrary functions of invariant generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor field . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case when @xmath8 with @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the covariant derivative of spinor field : @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the spinor affine connection . in @xmath13 s",
    "are the dirac matrices in curve space - time and obey the following algebra @xmath14 and are connected with the flat space - time dirac matrices @xmath15 in the following way @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a set of tetrad 4-vectors .",
    "the spinor affine connection matrices @xmath19 are uniquely determined up to an additive multiple of the unit matrix by the equation @xmath20 with the solution @xmath21    varying with respect to @xmath22 one finds the spinor field equations :    [ speq ] @xmath23    the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 in account of spinor field equations and takes the form @xmath26    we consider the case when the spinor field depends on @xmath27 only . in this case for the components of energy - momentum tensor we find    @xmath28    a detailed study of nonlinear spinor field was carried out in saha ( 2001a , 2004a , 2006c ) . in",
    "what follows , exploiting the equation of states we find the concrete form of @xmath7 which describes various types of perfect fluid and dark energy .",
    "first of all let us note that one of the simplest and popular model of the universe is a homogeneous and isotropic one filled with a perfect fluid with the energy density @xmath29 and pressure @xmath30 obeying the barotropic equation of state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath32 describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter , namely    [ zeta ] @xmath33    the barotropic model of perfect fluid is used to study the evolution of the universe .",
    "most recently the relation is exploited to generate a quintessence in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe ( saha , 2005 ; zlatev 1999 ) .    in order to describe the matter given by with a spinor field let us now substitute @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "thus , inserting @xmath29 and @xmath38 from and into we find @xmath39 with the solution ( saha , 2010a , 2010b , 2011 ) @xmath40 here @xmath41 is an integration constant .",
    "taking into account that the energy density should be non - negative , we conclude that @xmath41 is a negative constant , we write the components of the energy momentum tensor    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being a positive constant .",
    "as one sees , the energy density @xmath29 is always positive , while the pressure @xmath45 is positive for @xmath46 , i.e. , for usual fluid and negative for @xmath47 , i.e. for dark energy .    in account of it",
    "the spinor field lagrangian now reads @xmath6 - \\nu s^{1+w } , \\label{lspin1}\\ ] ] thus a massless spinor field with the lagrangian describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter . here",
    "the constant of integration @xmath44 can be viewed as constant of self - coupling .",
    "a detailed analysis of this study was given in krechet ( 2008 ) .",
    "an alternative model for the dark energy density was used by kamenshchik _",
    "( 2001 ) , where the authors suggested the use of some perfect fluid but obeying `` exotic '' equation of state .",
    "this type of matter is known as _ chaplygin gas_. the fate of density perturbations in a universe dominated by the chaplygin gas , which exhibit negative pressure was studied by fabris _",
    "model with chaplygin gas was also studied in the refs .",
    "( dev _ et al _ , 2003 ; bento _ et al _ , 2002 ) .",
    "let us now generate a chaplygin gas by means of a spinor field .",
    "a chaplygin gas is usually described by a equation of state @xmath48 then in case of a massless spinor field for @xmath7 one finds @xmath49 with the solution ( saha , 2010a , 2010b , 2011 ) @xmath50 on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor we find    @xmath51    as was expected , we again get positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "analogical results were obtained in ( cai _ et al _ , 2008 ) .",
    "thus the spinor field lagrangian corresponding to a chaplygin gas reads @xmath6 - \\bigl(a + \\lambda s^{1+\\gamma}\\bigr)^{1/(1+\\gamma)}. \\label{lspin2}\\ ] ] setting @xmath52 we find the result obtained in saha ( 2010a ) .",
    "finally , we simulate modified quintessence with a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "it should be noted that one of the problems that face models with dark energy is that of eternal acceleration .",
    "one of the possible way to avoid this problem is to introduce a negative @xmath53-term together with a quintessence , which gives rise to a oscillatory mode of expansion ( cardenas _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2003 , saha , 2006a ) in order to get rid of that problem quintessence with a modified equation of state was proposed which is given by ( saha , 2006b ) @xmath54 here @xmath55 some critical energy density .",
    "setting @xmath56 one obtains ordinary quintessence .",
    "it is well known that as the universe expands the ( dark ) energy density decreases . as a result ,",
    "being a linear negative function of energy density , the corresponding pressure begins to increase . in case of an ordinary quintessence",
    "the pressure is always negative , but for a modified quintessence as soon as @xmath34 becomes less than the critical one , the pressure becomes positive .    inserting @xmath29 and @xmath38 into we find @xmath57 with @xmath58 being a positive constant . on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor",
    "we find    @xmath59    lagrangian for spinor field describing perfect fluid and modified quintessence can be written in the following way ( saha , 2011 ) @xmath6 - \\nu s^{1+w } -\\frac{w}{1+w}{\\varepsilon}_{\\rm cr}. \\label{lspin2n}\\ ] ] one can easily verify , in case of @xmath60 corresponds to a perfect fluid , while nontrivial @xmath55 with @xmath61 generates modified quintessence .",
    "it should be noted that the restriction @xmath62 is very important , as it does not allow the system to cross over phantom divide barrier .",
    "we see that a nonlinear spinor field with specific type of nonlinearity can substitute perfect fluid and dark energy , thus give rise to a variety of evolution scenario of the universe .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the perfect fluid and the dark energy can be simulated by a nonlinear spinor field . in the section ii the nonlinearity was the subject to self - action . in ( saha , 2010a ) we have also considered the case when the nonlinearity was induced by a scalar field .",
    "it was also shown the in our context the results for induced nonlinearity is some special cases those of self - interaction . taking it into mind we study the evolution an universe filled with a nonlinear spinor field given by the lagrangian , with the nonlinear term @xmath7 is given by , and .",
    "let us study the evolution of an anisotropic bianchi type cosmological model filled with spinor field . in this report",

    "hence it is a singularity .    as far as bvi , bvi@xmath0 , bv , biii and frw models are concerned , they are all singular at a space - time point , where @xmath185 . moreover , in cases of bvi , bvi@xmath0 , bv and biii at least two scale factor @xmath187 s are directly related , hence there is always a possibility of more than one one scale factor becoming trivial , thus giving rise to a singularity at finite @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , components of the spinor field as well as the physically observable quantities such as charge , current , spin etc . constructed from them",
    "are inverse functions of @xmath100 ( saha , 2001a ) .",
    "hence we conclude that within the scope of the model considered here at any point where @xmath185 there occurs a space - time singularity .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , it is important to see whether our anisotropic bi model evolves into an isotropic frw model .",
    "isotropization means that at large physical times @xmath27 , when the volume factor @xmath100 tends to infinity , the three scale factors @xmath189 grow at the same rate .",
    "two wide - spread definition of isotropization read    [ aniso ] @xmath190    here @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the average anisototropy and shear , respectively .",
    "@xmath193 is the directional hubble parameter and @xmath194 average hubble parameter , where @xmath195 is the average scale factor .",
    "here we exploit the isotropization condition proposed proposed in bronnikov _",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) : @xmath196 then by rescaling some of the coordinates , we can make @xmath197 , and the metric will become manifestly isotropic at large @xmath27 .",
    "it can be shown that in case of bvi , bvi@xmath0 , bv and biii models the criteria does not hold , hence the isotropization process for these models does not take place .",
    "so we consider the bi model and study the problem od isotropization for this model in details .    from",
    "we find @xmath198 as is seen from in our case @xmath199 const as @xmath200 .",
    "recall that the isotropic frw model has same scale factor in all three directions , i.e. , @xmath201 .",
    "so for the bi universe to evolve into a frw one the constants @xmath150 s are likely to be identical , i.e. , @xmath202 .",
    "moreover , the isotropic nature of the present universe leads to the fact that the three other constants @xmath151 should be close to zero as well , i.e. , @xmath203 , ( @xmath204 ) , so that @xmath205^{-1}dt \\to 0 $ ] for @xmath206 ( for @xmath207 with @xmath208 the integral tends to zero as @xmath186 for any @xmath151 ) .",
    "it can be concluded that the spinor field lagrangian with @xmath209 leads to the isotropization of the universe as @xmath186 , moreover , in case of @xmath47 the system undergoes an earlier isotropization .",
    "let us now examine what kind of advantage one gets exploiting the spinor description of matter .",
    "we do it within the scope of a bi cosmological model . in doing so",
    ", we consider the case when the universe is filled with , say , van - der - waals fluid , radiation and quintessence . in this case",
    "we have    [ 3comp ] @xmath210    to solve one has to know @xmath36 and @xmath211 in terms of @xmath96 . it can be done exploiting bianchi identity @xmath212 the dark energy is supposed to interact with itself only , so it is minimally coupled to the gravitational field . as a result , the evolution equation for the energy density decouples from that of the perfect fluid . taking this into account and inserting into , we obtain two balance equations    [ 2eq ] @xmath213    in usual approach we are in trouble , as neither @xmath214 nor @xmath215 can not be expressed in terms of @xmath96 from . but",
    "if one uses spinor description for radiation , thanks to spinor field equation one finds @xmath216 as a result , in place of we now have @xmath217 which is quite computable for the given equation of state . for van - der - waals fluid",
    "we use the following equation of state @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a constant .",
    "the dark energy density @xmath220 can be expressed in terms of @xmath100 either solving or using the spinor description . thus using the spinor description and for radiation and dark energy , and defining the hubble parameter",
    ", we find the following system of equations    [ three ] @xmath221 , \\label{h}\\\\ \\dot { \\varepsilon}_{\\rm v } & = & - 3 \\bigl[{\\varepsilon}_{\\rm v } + \\frac{8w_1 { \\varepsilon}_{\\rm v}}{3 - { \\varepsilon}_{\\rm v } } - 3 { \\varepsilon}_{\\rm v}^2\\bigr ] h. \\label{vwf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for simplicity , we set @xmath222 and @xmath223 . the equation can be exactly solved for @xmath224 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath225 as one sees , it is quite a complicate expression . in",
    "what follows , we solve the system numerically . for this purpose we also set @xmath226 for quintessence .    in the figures [ veph1 ] and [ veph2 ] we plot the evolution of @xmath100 , @xmath227 and @xmath214 and @xmath35 for different initial values .",
    "as one sees , the pressure has negative value at the initial stage of evolution , then it begin to increase , thus giving rise to deceleration and finally becomes negative that results in the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "within the framework of cosmological gravitational field equivalence between the perfect fluid ( and dark energy ) and nonlinear spinor field has been established .",
    "it is shown that different types of dark energy can be simulated by means of a nonlinear spinor field . using the new description of perfect fluid or dark energy evolution of the universe has been studied within the scope of a bvi , bvi@xmath0 , bv , biii and bi anisotropic models as well as isotropic frw model .",
    "the corresponding einstein equations have been solved .",
    "it is shown that all the models give rise to a space - time singularity where @xmath100 is trivial . among the bianchi models",
    "considered only the bi allows isotropization of the initially anisotropic space - time .",
    "it is shown that the spinor description of fluid allows one to solve the two - fluid system without without imposing any additional condition .",
