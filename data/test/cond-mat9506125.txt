    "it is widely believed that the source of the pairing interaction which is responsible for the superconducting trasition in the high @xmath9 cuprates lies in the cuo@xmath4 planes , which are common to all of the cuprates .",

    "the most common point of view is that the unusual properities of the cuprates can be explained by an isotropic bcs pairing interaction which is contained in one of the planes . the idea behind most of the work is that although the pairing interaction may be inherently isotropic , the strongly anisotropic band structure leads to a gap structure which may account for the unusual superconducting properties of the cuprates .",

    "plane coupling is coherent , so that chain states are coupled to plane states with the same value of @xmath85 .",
    "the amount of mixing between the two states depends on the difference in energy between them so that , for example , in fig .  [ f0 ] the chain and plane fermi surfaces are most strongly mixed in the neighbourhood of their crossing . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the induced gap on the chain is small ( of the order of a few percent of the intrinsic gap in the plane ) wherever the chain and plane fermi surfaces are far apart .",
    "this is the reason for the large difference in the temperature dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "one solution to this is to couple the chains and planes incoherently , so that every state @xmath85 on the planes is coupled equally to every state @xmath176 on the chains .",
    "there is some evidence that there is incoherence along the @xmath3 axis : kleiner and mller@xcite have found an intrinsic josephson effect in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath13 and , more recently , in underdoped y-123 .",
    "the d.c .",
    "resistivity of y-123 in the normal state@xcite shows semiconducting behaviour in underdoped samples , and the optical conductivity along the @xmath3axis ( see , _ eg .",
    "_ , ref .",
    "and references contained therein ) has a non  metallic response .",
    "for an incoherent model of the type described above , the induced gap on the chains is proportional to the average over the fermi surface of the gap on the planes .",
    "the difficulty with this model is that , for a @xmath8 wave order parameter , the induced gap in the chains will vanish .",
    "it is , in fact , a general feature of @xmath8 wave order parameters that they do not contribute to incoherent processes ( see , for example , refs .   and ) . if on the other hand , we assume that the order parameter in the planes has an isotropic @xmath7 wave symmetry , then the induced gap on the chains will not vanish .",
    "the problem now , however , is that incoherent coupling does not introduce a nodal structure into the gap the way coherent coupling does so that it is difficult to reconcile such a model with a linear low temperature penetration depth . for a model with incoherent chain ",
    "plane coupling to successfully describe the low temperature penetration depth , it would have to have an order parameter with nodes on the fermi surface but whose fermi surface average was nonzero , and the induced gap in the chains would have to be of the order of @xmath9 so that the temperature dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath10 would be similar .    leaving , for a moment , the discussion of the nature of the chain ",
    "plane coupling , we will now turn to a more conceptual problem  that of the size of the chain ",
    "plane coupling .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath37 is chosen to account both for the fact that @xmath177 @xcite and for the size of the induced gap in the chains . as is well known",
    ", the chain  plane coupling can degrade @xmath9 substantially .",
    "we find that for @xmath38 , @xmath9 is only 65% of its value at @xmath178 .",
    "it is also difficult to reconcile the picture of weakly coupled two dimensional planes with such large values of the chain  plane coupling . in our model",
    "the ratio of the electron hopping strengths along the @xmath3 and in  plane directions is @xmath179 , so that it is difficult to imagine that the @xmath3 axis coupling is a weak perturbation in an otherwise two dimensional system .",
    "the challenge , therefore , for theories which begin with models of a single cuo@xmath4 plane is to explain the large anisotropy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 supercurrents in ybco without invoking a large chain  plane coupling .",
    "kresin and wolf@xcite have suggested that proximity effect models require an inelastic channel for the chain  plane coupling . in their two  plane model , electrons can hop between the planes through coherent tunneling or through scattering from a phonon .",
    "their model is more three dimensional than the ones discussed above since the inelastic interplane coupling acts as a pairing process which leads to an increase in @xmath9 .",
    "it is possible that in a chain  plane model , some kind of inelastic transport mechanism along the @xmath3 axis might lead to a sufficiently large gap in the chains that @xmath11 and @xmath10 would have similar @xmath79 dependences .",
    "the idea of a mixture of pairing interactions has recently been proposed by song and annett,@xcite although they have limited their discussion to mixing phonons and coulomb interactions within a single plane .",
    "there is also the issue of whether a simple two  band model can be representative of y-123 .",
    "more careful band structure calculations @xcite find that the fermi surface has four pieces instead of two .",
    "the two additional pieces of fermi surface come from the internal structure of the cuo@xmath4 bilayer ( which we have treated as a single layer ) and from the internal structure of the cuo chains .",
    "the inclusion of these two pieces of fermi surface is not likely to affect the important results contained within this paper however : the additional piece of fermi surface due to the cuo@xmath4 bilayer has a nearly tetragonal symmetry ( and will therefore contribute to the anisotropy in the penetration depth ) and the piece due to the cuo chains is small and will only make a small change to the screening currents .",
    "our final conclusion , then , is as follows : a proximity model for y-123 in which the superconducting pairing interaction is localised to the planes and the chain ",
    "plane coupling is coherent will not account for the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of the penetration depth seen in experiments .",
    "it is possible that other models for the chain  plane coupling will be able to adequately describe the @xmath12 anisotropy .",
    "the single largest problem faced by proximity models is that penetration depth experiments @xcite seem to indicate that the gap in the chains is of the same order as the gap in the planes .",
