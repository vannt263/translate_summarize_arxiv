    "in the past year there has been remarkable progress in the field of numerical relativity , particularly in the simulation of binary black hole systems .",
    "some of today s codes are capable of tracking the holes for many orbits before the merger and ringdown @xcite . since a primary goal of numerical relativity is the production of gravitational wave templates associated with the merger of black holes , it is important to simultaneously make progress with the tools which allow for their accurate generation and extraction .",
    "the schemes which have been able to push forward the binary black hole problem either use spatial compactification @xcite , which brings spatial infinity at a finite coordinate location , or mesh refinement @xcite , which allows the boundary to be placed further out by using lower resolution far away from the strong field region .",
    "a limitation of both methods is that the number of grid - points per wavelength gradually diminishes as the radiation propagates away from the sources and therefore the quality of the gravitational radiation progressively deteriorates , forcing the extraction to occur at a relatively small distance from the final hole extracted at @xmath1 and @xmath2 done by baker _",
    "@xcite seems to indicate that the extraction at small distances leads to sufficiently accurate results . ] .",
    "the undesirable effect of a time - like boundary with a chronological future that intersects the region of interest ( where physical quantities are calculated ) , was highlighted in @xcite .    to improve the quality of the outgoing radiation one should aim to keep the coordinate distance that the waves have to travel to a minimum , without making their speed go to zero .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by employing asymptotically null slices @xcite , or by supplementing the cauchy evolution with a characteristic code @xcite , which extends all the way to infinity .",
    "see figures [ fig : conformal1 ] , [ fig : conformal2 ] , and [ fig : conformal3 ] .",
    "both methods resolve incoming waves poorly at very large distances , but these are not expected to be significant .",
    "the reason for not using a single characteristic evolution scheme , without a cauchy interior covering the strong field region , is that such a scheme tends to develop caustics , where neighbouring characteristics focus and the coordinate system breaks down .     and @xmath3 ( the initial and final time ) , and a time - like artificial boundary @xmath4 .",
    "since it is not known how to specify local boundary conditions which do not introduce spurious radiation or reflect outgoing waves , the accuracy of the solution is limited to the future domain of dependence of @xmath5 ( green region ) .",
    "the solution in the grey region , which is causally connected to the boundary , is inaccurate . in this situation one",
    "is forced to extract gravitational radiation relatively close to the sources.,width=377 ]     can be placed far away from the sources and is approximately null ( the incoming modes travel very slowly ) .",
    "gravitational radiation can be accurately extracted at much larger distances and with lower computational cost than with standard space - like slices .",
    "see table i of @xcite for a comparison of computational costs and errors with different slices.,width=377 ]     ( future null infinity ) , where the radiation is unambiguously defined .",
    "initial data is specified at @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the two schemes are connected by a time - like interface @xmath7 .",
    "although in principle one could use the asymptotically null approach up to null infinity , experiments with the wave equation in spherical symmetry suggest that the scheme is less effective than that which uses a time - like boundary at very large distances @xcite.,width=377 ]    in this work we describe a fourth order accurate algorithm for the axisymmetric massless klein - gordon scalar field around a schwarzschild black hole , which employs a cauchy evolution scheme , based on space - like slices , and a characteristic scheme , based on null slices .",
    "the outer boundary of the interior cauchy region is a time - like surface and coincides with the inner boundary of the characteristic region .",
    "communication between the two regions is done taking into account the propagation of the characteristic variables . at the discrete level",
    "the interface is implemented with touching grids .",
    "we find that when the slices are not simultaneous , this particular multi - grid approach is better suited than overlapping grids , as it avoids complications due to causality .",
    "the radial coordinate of the characteristic region is compactified in order to reach future null infinity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : continuum ] we describe the continuum scalar field initial - boundary value problem in the cauchy and characteristic regions and discuss the interface treatment . in section [ sec : discrete ] we provide details of the discretization method and in section [ sec : tests ] we describe the tests carried out to validate the code , including the simulation of the late - time tail decay .",
    "in this section we describe the continuum problem , giving the explicit form of the equations , and the interface treatment . the schwarzschild line element in kerr - schild",
    "coordinates takes the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath10 .",
    "the surface defined by @xmath11 is null and its normal , provided it belongs to the future null cone , points toward increasing values of @xmath12 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the shorthand @xmath13 . using @xmath14 , in the cauchy region",
    "the wave equation on the schwarzschild background , @xmath15 , takes the form @xmath16    in bondi coordinates the schwarzschild line element is @xmath17 and it is related to ( [ eq : ks ] ) via the coordinate transformation @xmath18 which implies @xmath19 where there is no cause for confusion we will not distinguish between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    the klein - gordon equation in the characteristic region becomes @xmath22 note the lack of second partial derivatives @xmath23 , reflecting the fact that the @xmath24 surface is characteristic .",
    "we focus on axisymmetric solutions of the equations ( [ eq : wavecauchy ] ) and ( [ eq : wavechar ] ) , as we do not expect additional difficulties to arise in the general 3-dimensional case .",
    "this implies @xmath25 and regularity demands that , across the axis @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the scalar field is an even function of @xmath28 .    since the discretization of second order systems tends to be more subtle than that of fully first order systems @xcite , we perform a reduction to first order and discretise the resulting system . in the cauchy region",
    "we introduce the auxiliary variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the reduced system is @xmath32 we also have the constraint @xmath33 , which propagates with zero speed and therefore does not introduce complications at the boundary .",
    "this system is symmetrizable hyperbolic provided that @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it has non trivial characteristic speeds @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the radial direction and the corresponding characteristic variables are @xmath37    to reduce equation ( [ eq : wavechar ] ) to first order we introduce @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the reason for this choice of auxiliary variables is that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are null vectors",
    ". we will refer to @xmath43 and @xmath44 as null variables .",
    "the reduced system is @xmath45    to reach @xmath46 we compactify the characteristic radial coordinate @xmath47 by introducing a new independent variable @xmath48 such that @xmath49 in the last equation @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the location of the interface boundary in the cauchy and characteristic coordinate systems , respectively .",
    "the surface @xmath52 corresponds to future null infinity .",
    "effectively , this amounts to replacing in system ( [ eq : reduced1])([eq : reduced4 ] ) the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath47 with @xmath53 there are coefficients in equation ( [ eq : reduced1 ] ) that contain indetermined forms , which can be explicitly evaluated using the limit @xmath54 we typically use @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "a necessary condition for well - posedness for the interior cauchy problem is that at the boundary and at the interface data is prescribed to the incoming characteristic variables .",
    "if no data is specified to these variables , then one can expect to lose uniqueness .",
    "the characteristic region can provide accurate data for the incoming mode by setting @xmath57 on the other hand , the characteristic problem requires data for the outgoing null variable @xmath44 .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath58_{r = r_i}.\\label{eq : v}\\ ] ]      future null infinity corresponds to the boundary surface @xmath59 . here , as a result of the compactification , the speed of the incoming variable @xmath43 approaches zero , so there are no incoming modes ( the surface is null )",
    ". no data is required at this boundary and its numerical treatment is particularly simple .",
    "see subsection [ sec : scri ] .",
    "stable finite difference approximations of the initial - boundary value problem for the wave equation in the cauchy region ( not coupled to the characteristic problem ) are available .",
    "for example , by approximating the spatial derivatives using finite difference operators that satisfy the summation by parts rule @xcite , it is possible to construct schemes which conserve a discrete energy @xcite , a positive definite quadratic form of the dependent variables .",
    "boundary conditions can then be imposed either using olsson s method @xcite or using penalty terms @xcite .",
    "it is possible to obtain energy estimates in the characteristic region @xcite , and in turn for the coupled cauchy - characteristic problem .",
    "ideally , one would like to achieve similar estimates at the discrete level .",
    "although we have been able to formally extend these estimates to the discrete case , the semi - discrete problem that we consider fails to admit solutions for generic initial data .",
    "formally , one can obtain discrete estimates for the semi - discrete system @xmath60 where @xmath61 , which is a shorthand for @xmath62 , is a vector - valued grid - function having the dynamical variables as components and the variables @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are discretised with indices @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath69 is left continuous , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are periodic , the matrices are constant and symmetric and @xmath70 is singular .",

    "we can assume that @xmath70 is diagonal and therefore at least one equation in system ( [ eq : semidiscrete ] ) does not contain derivatives with respect to @xmath69 . multiplying on the left by @xmath80 and using the fact that the matrices are constant and symmetric , we get @xmath81 summing over the indices corresponding to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and integrating in @xmath69",
    "gives the equality @xmath82_{u = u_0}^{u = u_1 } + \\int_{u = u_0}^{u = u_1 } \\left[w_i^t a^x w_i \\right]_{i=0}^{i = n } du = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath83_{u = u_0}^{u = u_1 } = f(u_1)-f(u_0)$ ] , @xmath84_{i=0}^{i = n } = f_n - f_0 $ ] , the index @xmath66 corresponds to the @xmath63 direction , and the indices corresponding to @xmath64 and @xmath65 are suppressed . despite the estimate , a solution of ( [ eq : semidiscrete ] ) does not exist .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the equation that does not involve derivatives in the @xmath69 direction .",
    "the system @xmath85 , for generic @xmath86 , is overdetermined because the operator @xmath71 is singular .",
    "since the summation by parts approach does not appear to work , our guiding principle will be to discretise the problem in a way consistent with the continuum problem , for which estimates do exist .",
    "numerical experiments will be crucial for establishing convergence of the resulting scheme .",
    "the discretization of the cauchy problem is done in a standard way : the derivatives are approximated with centered fourth order accurate finite difference operators @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . when applied to a grid - function @xmath91 , operator ( [ eq : fourth ] )",
    "gives @xmath92    the boundaries , the interface and the axis of symmetry are implemented using ghost points . to eliminate the black hole singularity from the domain we use excision . at the boundary",
    "the ghost points are populated using extrapolation and by overwriting the incoming characteristic fields , if any are present , at the boundary point .",
    "see appendix b.2 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "near the axis of symmetry these are populated using the regularity conditions , i.e. , using the fact that @xmath93 is an even function of @xmath28 across the axis .",
    "the interface boundary is treated as if it was an outer boundary , with the only exception that the incoming mode is provided by the characteristic evolution .",
    "we also add some artificial dissipation to the scheme of the form @xmath94 , explicitly @xmath95 with @xmath96 @xcite and use fourth order runge - kutta to integrate in time with a courant factor of @xmath97 .",
    "although we are investigating a linear problem , the partial differential equations have variable coefficients .",
    "a certain amount of artificial dissipation is desirable for stability and will most likely be necessary in the non - linear case .      the discretization of the evolution part of the system , eqs .",

    "it is advanced in the @xmath47 direction by using fourth order runge - kutta ( with a `` time '' step equal to the radial mesh spacing ) .",
    "this requires the evaluation of the coefficients and forcing terms of ( [ eq : reduced1 ] ) at intermediate time steps .",

    "to study gravitational radiation at future null infinity , where it is unambiguously defined , numerical schemes have to evolve the fields up to that surface .",
    "an approach which would allow for this is cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm ) , whereby cauchy and characteristic evolutions are matched across a time - like world - tube .",
    "this approach presents many advantages over other boundary conditions , such as maximally dissipative or absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "ccm makes it possible , for example , to compute accurate waveform and polarisation properties at infinity .",
    "it is a highly computationally efficient technique which can eliminate the undesirable reflections and inaccuracies that other boundary conditions would introduce @xcite .    in this work",
    "we described a fourth order accurate algorithm for a cauchy - characteristic formulation of the wave equation written in first order form . by compactifying the radial coordinate in the characteristic region we can evolve all the way to @xmath46 .",
    "we carried out convergence tests showing that the scheme is fourth order convergent and were able to reproduce the expected tail decay rate .",
    "the interface was implemented using touching grids , which share a common smooth boundary , and by communicating the relevant characteristic / null variables .",
    "the success for the scalar field case is clearly only a necessary condition for the fully nonlinear case .",
    "the nonlinear extension of this work will require a careful choice of coordinate conditions and attention to the propagation of constraints @xcite .",
    "it will be crucial to establish how constraint violations propagate across the domain , so that the interface treatment can be done consistently . in three dimensions",
    "one would still require a smooth interface boundary implemented through either overlapping grids @xcite , which work well with simultaneous slices and can also allow for moving boundaries , or touching grids @xcite .",
