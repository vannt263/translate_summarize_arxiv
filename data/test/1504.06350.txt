    "geometric covering problems have been a focus of research for decades . here",
    "we are given some set of points @xmath0 and a set @xmath1 where each @xmath2 can cover some subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "the subset of @xmath0 is generally induced by some geometric object .",
    "for example , @xmath0 might be a set of points in the plane , and @xmath3 consists of the points contained within some disk in the plane .",
    "for most variants , the problem is np - hard and can easily be reduced to an instance of the combinatorial set cover problem which has a polynomial - time @xmath4-approximation algorithm , which is the best possible approximation under standard complexity assumptions @xcite .",
    "the main question therefore is to determine for which variants of geometric set cover can we obtain polynomial - time approximation algorithms with approximation ratio @xmath5 , as any such algorithm must exploit the geometry of the problem to achieve the result .",
    "this area has been studied extensively , see for example @xcite , and much progress has been made utilizing algorithms that are based on solving the standard linear programming relaxation .",
    "unfortunately this technique has severe limitations for some variants of geometric set cover , and new ideas are needed to make progress on these variants .",
    "in particular , the techniques are lacking when the points @xmath0 we wish to cover is a simple polygon , and we wish to place the smallest number of points in @xmath0 that collectively `` see '' the polygon .",
    "this problem is classically referred to as the _ art gallery problem _ as an art gallery can be modeled as a polygon and the points placed by an algorithm represent cameras that can `` guard '' the art gallery .",
    "this has been one of the most well - known problems in computational geometry for many years , yet still to this date the best polynomial - time approximation algorithm for this problem is a @xmath4-approximation algorithm .",
    "the key issue is a fundamental lack of understanding of the combinatorial structure of visibility inside simple polygons .",
    "it seems that in order to develop powerful approximation algorithms for this problem , the community first needs to better understand the underlying structure of such visibility .    * visibility graphs .",
    "* a very closely related issue which has received a lot of attention in the community is the _ visibility graph _ of a simple polygon . given a simple polygon @xmath0 ,",
    "the visibility graph @xmath6 of @xmath0 has the following structure . for each vertex @xmath7",
    ", there is a vertex in @xmath8 , and there is an edge connecting two vertices in @xmath9 if and only if the corresponding vertices in @xmath0 `` see '' each other ( i.e. , the line segment connecting the points does not go outside the polygon ) .",
    "two major open problems regarding visibility graphs of simple polygons are the visibility graph characterization problem and the visibility graph recognition problem .",
    "the _ visibility graph characterization _",
    "problem seeks to define a set of properties that all visibility graphs satisfy .",
    "the _ visibility graph recognition _ problem is the following . given a graph @xmath9 ,",
    "determine if there exists a simple polygon @xmath0 such that @xmath9 is the visibility graph of @xmath0 in polynomial time .",
    "the problems of characterizing and recognizing the visibility graphs of simple polygons have had partial results given dating back to over 25 years ago @xcite and remain open to this day with only a few special cases being solved . characterization and recognition results have been given in the special cases of `` spiral '' polygons @xcite and `` tower polygons '' @xcite .",
    "there have been several results @xcite that collectively have led to four necessary conditions that a simple polygon visibility graph must satisfy . that is ,",
    "if the graph @xmath9 does not satisfy all four of the conditions then we know that @xmath9 is not the visibility graph for _ any _ simple polygon , and moreover it can be determined if a graph @xmath9 satisfies all of the necessary conditions in polynomial time .",
    "streinu , however , has given an example of graph that satisfies all of the necessary conditions but is not a visibility graph for any simple polygon @xcite , implying that the set of conditions is not sufficient and therefore a strengthening of the necessary conditions is needed . unfortunately it is not even known if simple polygon visibility graph recognition is in np .",
    "see @xcite for a nice survey on these problems and other related visibility problems .",
    "* pseudo - polygons . *",
    "given the difficulty of understanding simple polygon visibility graphs , orourke and streinu @xcite considered the visibility graphs for a special case of polygons called _ pseudo - polygons _ which we will now define .",
    "an arrangement of _ pseudo - lines _",
    "@xmath10 is a collection of simple curves , each of which separates the plane , such that each pair of pseudo - lines of @xmath10 intersects at exactly one point , where they cross .",
    "let @xmath11 be a set of points in @xmath12 , and let @xmath10 be an arrangement of @xmath13 pseudo - lines such that every pair of points @xmath14 and @xmath15 lie on exactly one pseudo - line in @xmath10 , and each pseudo - line in @xmath10 contains exactly two points of @xmath0 .",
    "the pair @xmath16 is called a _ pseudo configuration of points _ ( pcp ) in general position .",
    "intuitively a pseudo - polygon is determined similarly to a standard euclidean simple polygon except using pseudo - lines instead of straight line segments .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the pseudo - line through the points @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we view @xmath17 as having three different components .",
    "the subsegment of @xmath17 connecting @xmath14 and @xmath15 is called the _ segment _ , and we denote it @xmath18 . removing @xmath18 from @xmath17",
    "leaves two disjoint _",
    "rays_. let @xmath19 denote the ray starting from @xmath14 and moving away from @xmath15 , and we let @xmath20 denote the ray starting at @xmath15 and moving away from @xmath14 .",
    "consider the pseudo line @xmath21 in a pcp ( indices taken modulo @xmath22 and are increasing in counterclockwise order throughout the paper ) .",
    "we let @xmath23 denote the segment of this line .",
    "pseudo - polygon _ is obtained by taking the segments @xmath23 for @xmath24 if ( 1 ) the intersection of @xmath23 and @xmath25 is only the point @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , and ( 2 ) distinct segments @xmath23 and @xmath28 do not intersect for all @xmath29 .",
    "we call the segments @xmath23 the _ boundary edges_. a pseudo - polygon separates the plane into two regions : `` inside '' the pseudo - polygon and `` outside '' the pseudo - polygon , and any two points @xmath14 and @xmath15 see each other if the segment of their pseudo - line does not go outside of the pseudo - polygon . see fig [ fig : ppolygon ] for an illustration .",
    "pseudo - polygons can be viewed as a combinatorial abstraction of simple polygons .",
    "note that every simple polygon is a pseudo - polygon ( simply allow each @xmath17 to be the straight line through @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , and streinu showed that there are pseudo - polygons that can not be `` stretched '' into a simple polygon @xcite .",
    "we now have that @xmath30 is the vertex - edge visibility graph for some pseudo - polygon @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : edgevis ] that @xmath9 is the visibility graph of @xmath0 , giving us the following theorem .",
    "a graph @xmath9 with a given hamiltonian cycle @xmath31 is the visibility graph of a pseudo - polygon @xmath0 if and only if there is an assignment of candidate blockers to the invisible pairs that satisfies necessary conditions 1 - 5 .",
