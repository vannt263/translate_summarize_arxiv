    "it has been argued by shibahashi and saio ( 1985 ) that the cut - off  is largely influenced by the @xmath1 relation which requires a careful modelling of these layers .",
    "frequently , atmospheres in stellar  are based on an eddington or hopf law ( e.g. mihalas 1978 ) , where the radiative transfer is considered to be  independent ( grey case ) , and convection is not included .",
    "we used the lte kurucz atlas9 code ( kurucz , 1993 ) without the `` overshooting option '' ( castelli 1996 ) to calculate an interpolation table for @xmath5 .",
    "model  with solar composition were computed for @xmath6 and for  ranging from 7400 to 10000k , and no additional contribution to line opacity by microturbulence has been assumed .",
    "the internal structure models of 1.8@xmath7 representative for cp2 stars were computed with the cesam code ( morel 1993 and 1997 ) .",
    "we do not include effects from a magnetic field .",
    "we shall call `` hopf '' and `` kurucz '' models full stellar models whose atmospheres are derived from hopf s law and kurucz model s respectively .",
    "to calculate the cut - off frequencies we make the assumptions that for low - degree modes the displacement is essentially vertical , so that the horizontal component can be neglected .",
    "consequently , we consider only radial modes and , because we investigate modes of high radial orders , we adopt the cowling approximation .",
    "we do not include the effects of a magnetic field .",
    "the _ cut - off , _ , is the maximum value of the  above which modes are not at all reflected towards the stellar interior but propagate outwards in the atmosphere .",
    "we have calculated the cut - off   according to three expressions for the acoustic potential : the formulation by vorontsov & zarkhov ( 1989 ) ( ) , gough ( 1986 ) ( ) , and the approximation of an isothermal  ( ) ( see e.g. gough , 1986 ) .",
    "table1 gives the values of these cut - off   for the hopf and kurucz  of 1.8 @xmath7 and age 500 myr .",
    "along the main sequence , the relative difference between the cut - off frequencies from kurucz and hopf models of 1.8 m@xmath8 models remains almost unchanged and is about 8.5% ( see tab.1 ) ( see also shibahashi , 1991 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with results of shibahashi & saio ( 1985 ) and of matthews et al .",

    "we do not consider here roap stars for which the highest observed frequency probably is a harmonic of their nonlinear oscillation .    since the uncertainty in the age determination can introduce a significant error in the computed",
    ", we will focus our discussion on those two roap stars , hd24712 and hd128898 , for which we have more reliable mass estimates due to the availability of hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the roap star * hd24712 * can be reproduced with a model of 1.63@xmath7 , @xmath10 and an age of about 900myr .",
    "the cut - off  is 2280@xmath2hz and 2480@xmath2hz for the hopf and kurucz models respectively .",
    "we have also computed hopf and kurucz  with appropriate age for * hd128898 * ( @xmath3cir ) .",
    "a kurucz  was calculated with an opacity distribution function specific to the composition of @xmath3cir ( piskunov & kupka 1997 ) .",
    "stellar models with 1.93@xmath7 , @xmath11 and an age of 400myr , fit the observed values ( kupka et al .",
    "the cut - off frequencies  for the hopf and kurucz models are 2346 and 2600@xmath2hz , respectively .",
    "the  computed for the kurucz model is compatible with the largest observed frequency .",
    "however , the cut - off frequency depends on the model input parameters and one must therefore account for uncertainties inherent to observations and modelling .",
    "evolutionary tracks and lines of constant cut - off frequency for kurucz models are plotted in fig.1a together with the observational error boxes .",
    "asteroseismology is a powerful tool for determining the evolutionary status of stars via the frequency separation @xmath12 ( see e.g. shibahashi 1991 , and kurtz & martinez 1993 ) .",
    "if @xmath13 can be measured , a more reliable estimate of the evolutionary status can be derived than with our classical approach .",
    "fig.1b shows lines of constant frequency spacing @xmath13 for the same models as for fig.1a .",
    "the observed value @xmath14hz for hd 24712 ( kurtz et al .",
    "1989 ) is consistent with our classically determined error box , while there is a serious problem for @xmath3 cir , because the observed value of @xmath13 is @xmath15hz ( kurtz et al .",
    "1994 ) which can not be reconciled with the spectroscopically determined  and/or the luminosity .",
    "we have shown that along the main sequence , kurucz model atmospheres increase the cut - off  by about 8.5% relative to the value derived from the hopf @xmath1 relation .    for hd24712 and @xmath3cir , we find models with kurucz atmospheres and with parameters in agreement with the observational error box which have a theoretical cut - off frequency larger than the largest observed  and hence are in agreement with observations .",
    "one may thus speculate that the old controversy about a mismatch between observed largest frequencies and theoretical cut - off frequencies of roap star models is resolved .",
    "however , effects from e.g. an abundance different from solar might affect the cut - off frequency .",
    "abundant rare - earth elements , through blanketing effects , could decrease the surface temperature and thus increase the cut - off .",
    "this  might also be affected by a chemical composition gradient ( vauclair & dolez 1990 ) . magnetic field ( dziembowski & goode 1996 ) and nlte effects should also be taken into account .",
