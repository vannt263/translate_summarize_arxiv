    "if the ground state of a quantum dot has a fixed number of electrons , decreasing the temperature to below the charging energy of the dot reduces the conductance @xmath0 through the dot because of coulomb blockade  @xcite . if the electron occupancy is odd , lowering the temperature even further increases @xmath0 , until it reaches ( for a symmetrically - coupled dot ) @xmath10 at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the conductance is due to the single - channel kondo ( 1ck ) effect  @xcite , in which the dot acts as a magnetic impurity that interacts with the spins of the electrons in the surrounding leads . at low temperature , below a characteristic temperature @xmath4 , a spin resonance is formed , and the conductance through the resonance is perfect and equals @xmath11 per spin .",
    "the physics of 1ck at low energy can be described by a fermi liquid theory : at zero temperature , all the particles that scatter off the impurity are scattered into single - particle states , where the incoming and outgoing states are connected by a @xmath12 scattering phase shift  @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : s - matrix discussion ] ) .",
    "the 1ck physics can be generalized to more complex models , known as multi - channel kondo , where a few independent channels compete to screen the impurity  @xcite . in the two - channel kondo ( 2ck )",
    "case , when the couplings of the two channels to the impurity are identical the system flows to a non - fermi liquid fixed point at zero temperature . at a non - fermi liquid fixed point , the simple picture of elastic scattering of single particles is no longer valid . at zero temperature ,",
    "a single particle that is scattered off a 2ck impurity can be scattered only into a many - body state  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no elastic single - particle scattering off a 2ck impurity at the non - fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "the 2ck system was first discussed as a purely theoretical problem  @xcite , but it was soon invoked as a candidate explanation for remarkable low - energy properties of some heavy fermion materials  @xcite and glassy metals  @xcite and more recently in graphene  @xcite . in the past decade , a few single - impurity realizations of the 2ck system were proposed  @xcite , offering the hope of microscopically manipulating system parameters , and one of the proposals  @xcite was built and measured  @xcite .",
    "the conductance through a 2ck impurity , within one of the two channels , at the non - fermi liquid fixed point is @xmath13 per spin , assuming equal coupling to two leads in that channel  @xcite .",
    "given that there are no elastic single - particle scattering events off the impurity in the non - fermi liquid fixed point , one might imagine that the transport through a 2ck impurity has no coherent part . in this work , we show that at this fixed point exactly half of the conductance is carried by coherent processes  @xcite .",
    "this is because in a transport measurement through a single - level quantum dot there are ( at least ) two leads that are attached by tunneling to the dot .",
    "the electrons that interact with the effective spin of the dot are described by an operator @xmath14 , a linear combination of electron operators in the two leads .",
    "another linear combination of electron operators in the two leads , @xmath15 , is decoupled from the dot . while there are no elastic single @xmath14-particle scattering events , coherent transport via @xmath15-particles",
    "is possible .",
    "the coherent properties of the transport through an impurity can be measured in a two - path experiment , in which electrons are sent from a source lead through two possible paths to a drain lead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic double slit ] ) .",
    "we assume that the propagations along the different paths are independent of each other , namely , changes in the properties of one path do not affect the propagation along the other path .",
    "one of the paths contains the impurity of interest , and the two paths encircle a magnetic flux @xmath16 .",
    "the interference between the two paths depends on @xmath16 through the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "hence , the conductance of the setup contains two parts : a flux - independent part , which is related to the separate conductances of the two paths , and a flux - dependent part , which is related to the interference of the two paths .     and @xmath17 , and they encircle a magnetic flux @xmath16 .",
    "the coherent transport through the kondo impurity can be studied by embedding it into one of the paths . ]",
    "two measurable quantities can be extracted from a two - path experiment : the transmission phase shift of the flux - dependent conductance , and the ratio between the amplitude of the flux - dependent part and the flux - independent part of the conductance .",
    "we cast the source - to - drain conductance of the two - path device into the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the conductance through the path with the impurity when the reference path is switched off , and @xmath20 is the conductance through the reference path when the impurity s conduction is switched off .",
    "the impurity will generally be realized as one or more quantum dots , so we will interchangeably refer to `` impurity '' and `` dot '' depending on context .",
    "we assume that the paths are independent : manipulations of the dot ( for example , with gate potential ) do not influence the conductance of the reference path , and vice versa .",
    "the _ transmission phase _ , @xmath1 , is related to the relative phase between the two paths , and the _ normalized visibility _",
    "@xmath2 is related to the size of the coherent part of the conductance compared to the total conductance .",
    "note : the phase of the reference path is arbitrary , determined by path length , potential landscape , etc . so is the phase of the path with the impurity , excluding the transmission phase of the impurity itself . below",
    "we assume for simplicity that each of these phases is @xmath21 mod @xmath22 , so that @xmath1 is purely the transmission phase of the impurity itself .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 , implicit in eq .  , is such that for fermi liquids , at zero temperature and without spin , @xmath23 .",
    "this can be easily checked by applying the landauer formalism  @xcite for the two - path experiment setup .",
    "the normalized visibility @xmath2 can be reduced to below one by four mechanisms : first , if the transmitted electrons accumulate an energy - dependent phase when they are scattered through the impurity , or just along either path , then at nonzero temperature @xmath2 is reduced because of the thermal averaging .",
    "second , if the phase depends on the spin , the spin summation can also reduce @xmath2 .",
    "third , if part of the conductance is carried by incoherent scattering processes , where single electrons are scattered into many - body states , the interference and therefore @xmath2 are reduced .",
    "fourth , electrons that are subjected to external dephasing lose their coherence , so external dephasing also decreases the interference and @xmath2 .",
    "external dephasing depends on the specific model and the details of the setup .",
    "hence , we focus mainly on the first three mechanisms , and only qualitatively explore the effect of external dephasing on @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be measured directly , the normalized visibility can be experimentally determined .",
    "this requires two measurements : the conductance through one of the paths , and the two - path conductance . measuring the transmission phase of a 1ck impurity in a two - path setup",
    "was already suggested before  @xcite , and the predicted @xmath5 was measured  @xcite , demonstrating coherent electron transmission through a many - body state . yet",
    ", no special attention was given to the amplitude of the flux - dependent part of the conductance .",
    "in particular , non - fermi liquid cases , where @xmath2 can give information on the underlying physics ( and also @xmath1 is different from that in the 1ck case ) , were not treated .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : s - matrix discussion ] , we relate @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the single - particle elements of the @xmath3-matrix , @xmath24 ( where the @xmath14-particles are the particles that interact with the dot ) . using arguments of many - body scattering , we find a relation between the coherent and the incoherent parts of the conductance @xmath25 , and rederive the known expression for the conductance  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the quantum conductance multiplied by a symmetry factor related to relative coupling to different leads .",
    "we also derive the following relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thermal- and spin - averaged value of the @xmath3-matrix .",
    "expressions for the dephasing rate and the ratio between the inelastic scattering cross section and the total cross section , both related to the normalized visibility @xmath2 , appear in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we show that spin summation has a crucial effect on @xmath1 and @xmath2 of kondo impurities .",
    "up to second order in @xmath30 ( and @xmath31 ) , spin summation locks the value of @xmath1 at @xmath12 independent of the actual phases that electrons accumulate when they cross the dot .",
    "moreover , spin summation reduces @xmath2 significantly , even when all the conductance is carried by coherent single - particle scattering . the @xmath12 phase - lock , and reduction of @xmath2 ,",
    "can be avoided if one measures the conductance of each spin separately , and extracts directly the transmission phase of each spin , @xmath32 , separately . a concrete realization of kondo impurities in quantum dots , with access to each spin separately ,",
    "was proposed by some of the present authors in ref .  .",
    "the main results of this work are as follows : it is known that in the 1ck case , at zero temperature , the transmission phase equals the scattering phase shift of the 1ck  @xcite , @xmath5 .",
    "since all the electrons are elastically scattered , the normalized visibility is @xmath23 .",
    "however , when a magnetic field is applied , regular non - spin - resolved measurements of the conductance miss the magnetic field corrections . in this case , we find that the transmission phase @xmath1 remains @xmath12 to second order in @xmath33 , even though the scattering phase shift for each spin depends on the magnetic field  @xcite , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . in order to reveal the magnetic field dependence of the phase shift",
    ", one needs to perform a spin - resolved measurement , namely , to measure the conductance of each spin separately .    in the non - fermi liquid fixed point of the 2ck case",
    ", we find that at zero temperature @xmath37 , that is , exactly half of the conductance is carried by single - particle transmissions  @xcite .",
    "the electrons that elastically transmit through the 2ck impurity accumulate a @xmath5 phase when they cross the impurity . in the presence of a finite magnetic field ,",
    "the system flows under renormalization group to a fermi liquid fixed point , at zero temperature , rather than the non - fermi liquid one  @xcite . at this fermi liquid fixed point",
    ", we find that again , one needs to perform a spin - resolved measurement .",
    "a spin - summed measurement will lead , at zero temperature , to a transmission phase @xmath5 and a normalized visibility @xmath37 , despite the fact that the spin - dependent scattering phase shifts are @xmath38 , and despite the fact that the conductance is carried exclusively by single - particle scattering [ see eqs .   and  ] .",
    "measurement of each spin separately , however , will lead to the desired @xmath23 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : transmission phase and visibility ] , we briefly review possible realizations of electronic two - path experiments , and discuss what we learn from their analysis . we define the two measurable quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and discuss their physical meaning . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s - matrix discussion ] , we develop a scattering approach to the transport through an impurity , similar to the landauer formalism@xcite for the non - interacting case .",
    "we consider a many - body scattering matrix to include both elastic single - particle scattering and inelastic single - particle to multi - particle scattering .",
    "we rederive the conductance through the impurity and give the mathematical expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we focus on kondo impurities , and give the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for several kondo fixed points . we also briefly discuss the influence of possible external dephasing on the normalized visibility . finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ s - matrix appendix ] , we give a detailed derivation of the multi - particle scattering approach for the conductance , transmission phase , and normalized visibility . in appendix",
    "[ two paths setup appendix ] , we give more details about a possible two - path setup that can be tuned to fulfill the theoretical assumptions we have made in our analysis .",
    "in this section , we discuss two - path setups and define the transmission phase @xmath1 and the normalized visibility @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that the normalized visibility , @xmath2 , is distinct from the more common definition of the visibility .",
    "the prototype of two - path experiments is the double - slit experiment . in a double - slit experiment particles",
    "are launched toward the double slit , where they split into partial waves which interfere with each other . in the electronic version of the double - slit experiment , schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic double slit ] , a coherent electron beam is emitted from a source lead toward a drain lead , via a beam splitter that allows electron flow along two different paths that encircle a magnetic flux @xmath16 .",
    "the source - to - drain conductance is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the probability for an incoming electron with energy @xmath42 and spin @xmath43 to be transmitted through the double slit , and @xmath44 is the fermi - dirac distribution function . if all the electrons that pass through the double slit do so elastically and coherently , the probability @xmath41 is given by  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the transmission amplitudes of the two slits .",
    "the transmission amplitudes are complex quantities with a phase difference , @xmath48 , between them .",
    "the phase difference contains a contribution @xmath49 determined by the details of the transmission through the double - slit setup , and a magnetic - flux - dependent part @xmath50 coming from the ab effect .",
    "equation ( [ eq : transmission probability ] ) is valid only if all the electrons are coherently transferred through the double slit  @xcite . if some of the electrons are transferred incoherently through one of the slits , then , since these electrons do not interfere , the flux - dependent term of @xmath51 is reduced .",
    "if we embed into one of the paths a quantum dot ( as in the lower path in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic double slit ] ) , we can examine the dot s coherence properties by measuring the conductance .",
    "in such a device , the phase that electrons accumulate as they cross the dot is encoded in the relative phase between the two paths @xmath49 .    in experiments , the measured source to drain conductance",
    "is typically cast in the form @xmath52 @xmath53 is the part of the conductance which is independent of the magnetic flux , and is related to the independent conductances of the two paths , and @xmath54 is the amplitude of the flux - dependent part of the conductance . in the general case",
    ", @xmath1 is different from @xmath49 , but if @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath49 are independent of spin and energy , then @xmath55 . in standard two - path experiments , the ratio @xmath56 ,",
    "is called `` visibility '' , and it measures the strength of the flux - dependent conductance oscillation compared to the average conductance .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 can be reduced by several mechanisms .",
    "trivially , a mismatch between the transmission amplitudes , @xmath57 , decreases the ratio @xmath58 , and therefore reduces @xmath56 .",
    "in addition to the trivial transmission amplitude mismatch , four other mechanisms noted earlier can reduce @xmath56 : thermal averaging , spin averaging , inelastic scattering , and externally - induced dephasing .",
    "there is a conceptual difference between transmission amplitude mismatch of the two paths , and the other three mechanisms for @xmath56 reduction ( we assume for the moment that there is no external dephasing ) . unlike the transmission amplitude mismatch",
    ", these other mechanisms can not be probed by simple single - path conductance measurements of the system . to isolate the transmission mismatch from elastic versus inelastic scattering and energy or spin dependent phase",
    ", we decompose the conductance ( [ eq : typical conductivity ] ) into the form of eq .  :",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the independent conductances through the two paths , which can be measured directly by closing off one and then the other path .",
    "equation ( [ eq : definition of eta and phi ] ) defines a new quantity , the _ normalized visibility _",
    "@xmath2 . if all the electrons transmit coherently through the two paths , and accumulate the same phase , then @xmath23 , independent of possible transmission amplitudes mismatch .",
    "we want to make a comment about the feasibility of interference measurements in two - path experiments : in real experiments , there is a typical coherence length , @xmath60 , along which the propagating electrons preserve their coherence .",
    "this length depends on the details of the realization of the two - path setup , and we assume that it is much larger than the lengths of the two paths @xmath61 .",
    "however , this assumption is not enough : electrons with different energies propagate along the two paths , accumulating an energy - dependent phase difference @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fermi velocity . as a result",
    ", the thermal averaging introduces a new lengthscale , the thermal length  @xcite @xmath64 : @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\ & = 2\\left|t_{\\text{d},s}t_{\\text{ref},s}\\right|\\cos\\left[\\frac{e\\phi}{\\hbar c}\\right]\\frac{l_{\\rm ref}-l_d}{l_t}\\frac{1}{\\sinh[(l_{\\rm ref}-l_d)/l_t]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we also require that the difference in length between the two paths is much shorter than the thermal length  @xcite @xmath66 . in this case , the difference in length introduces a second - order correction to the amplitude of the oscillations : @xmath67}\\approx1-\\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{l_{\\rm ref}-l_d}{l_t}\\right)^2\\sim1-t^2 $ ] .

    "2 , we defined the normalized visibility @xmath2 , which is the amplitude of the ab oscillations , normalized in a certain way . in sec .",
    "3 , we showed that @xmath2 has a physical meaning , and that it is related to the proportion of the total conductance carried by single - particle scattering . in this subsection",
    "we want to comment about the feasibility of @xmath2-measurements .",
    "so far , we have discussed three mechanisms that reduce the normalized visibility : the possibility of non - coherent charge transfer through the dot into many - body states , thermal averaging over a transmission with energy - dependent phase , and averaging over spin - dependent transmission phase .",
    "ab oscillations in a real - life experimental setup can also be suppressed by other mechanisms that are not related to the physical properties of the examined impurity .",
    "a real experimental two - path setup is usually coupled to a complicated environment .",
    "for example , in an open ab ring setup the shapes of the two paths , the quantum dot(s ) , the tunnel barriers , and many other components of the setup are all defined by applying voltages to nearby nano - patterned electrodes .",
    "therefore , each component of the system is coupled to an environment ( metal electrodes , semiconducting leads ) with associated noise and degrees of freedom .",
    "an electron that propagates through the two paths leaves a trace in the environment ; equivalently , a propagating electron that interacts with the environment , accumulates a _",
    "phase  @xcite , @xmath80 . as a result",
    ", the amplitude of the ab oscillations is multiplied by the averaged value @xmath81 .",
    "the normalized visibility in the presence of the environment is therefore  @xcite @xmath82    the details of the coupling to the environment depend on the details of a specific experimental setup . yet",
    ", we can roughly estimate the external dephasing by assuming that the phase - randomness originates mostly from the thermal fluctuations of the environment .",
    "at nonzero temperature @xmath83 , the electrodes in the environment suffer from nyquist noise , and we can estimate @xmath84 .    hence , dephasing by the environment can reduce the normalized visibility linearly in the temperature . in the fermi liquid fixed points ,",
    "@xmath2 has @xmath85 corrections without external dephasing .",
    "this means that at low temperatures the dominant suppression of @xmath2 would be due to external dephasing . in the non - fermi liquid fixed point of the 2ck",
    ", @xmath2 has a @xmath86 dependence in the absence of external dephasing .",
    "thus , at low temperatures the change in @xmath2 ( enhancement for @xmath87 and reduction for @xmath88 ) , is expected to be stronger than its suppression due to external dephasing .",
    "the relation between the system and the environment is outside the scope of this work . in particular",
    ", we do not get into specific models for the environment .",
    "we want to note that there are models that treat rigorously the effect of a specific environment on the interference in ab rings ( for example , a quantum - point - contact that is coupled to an embedded quantum dot  @xcite ; or a fluctuating magnetic flux  @xcite ) .    in the 2ck non - fermi liquid case",
    ", a noisy environment can , in principle , turn on relevant operators .",
    "thus , a noisy environment with strong effect on the system would make the observation of the non - fermi liquid behavior difficult .",
    "hence , if a non - fermi liquid behavior is indeed observed in an experimental system , it indicates a relatively weak external dephasing .",
    "in this work we have focused on information that can be obtained from two - path experiments . typically , in two - path experiments , the measurable quantity is the transmission phase @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the combination of two measurements , the two path conductance together with the conductance of one of the paths ( either of the paths ) , gives us additional physical information about the nature of coherence in the transport .",
    "these two measurements allow us to normalize the amplitude of the flux - dependent conductance , with respect to the independent conductances of the two paths [ eq .  ] .",
    "we showed that the normalized amplitude @xmath2 is related to the fraction of scattering processes that involve only single particles .",
    "we have related @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the single - particle matrix element of the @xmath72-matrix .",
    "if there is a linear combination of the two leads ( denoted by @xmath15 ) which is decoupled both from the dot , and from the orthogonal linear combination ( @xmath14 ) , then , working in the @xmath89 basis we showed that @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be used to study @xmath90 . in the simple case of fermi liquids at zero temperature , where @xmath91 , @xmath1 turns out to be identical to @xmath92 , and @xmath23 .",
    "we also showed that in the absence of spin - symmetry , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are affected by the summation over spin in a standard conductance measurement .",
    "at zero temperature , we showed that the phase @xmath1 is locked at @xmath12 independent of @xmath92 [ see eq .  ] , and that @xmath2 is suppressed to below one [ see eq .  ] .",
    "a proper measurement in this case would involve independent measurement of the transport of each spin .    in the various fermi liquid fixed points of the kondo impurities",
    ", we have showed that the transmission phase equals the scattering phase shift @xmath93 .",
    "the normalized visibility at zero temperature is @xmath23 , and nonzero temperature reduces it with a correction @xmath94 .",
    "the small reduction of @xmath2 is due to two different physical effects of the temperature .",
    "first , the transmission phase is energy - dependent .",
    "when we thermally average over the temperature , @xmath1 remains at its zero - temperature value ( to this order of correction ) , but @xmath2 is reduced .",
    "second , the nonzero temperature allows incoherent scattering processes ( the leading irrelevant operator near the fixed point allows the scattering of single - particle states to many - body states ) .",
    "hence , a small part of the conductance is incoherent and therefore @xmath2 is reduced .    in the non - fermi liquid fixed point of the 2ck",
    ", we find that although there are no single @xmath14-particle to single @xmath14-particle scattering processes , a part of the conductance is still coherent .",
    "the transmission phase is @xmath5 despite the fact that @xmath92 is not defined . the normalized visibility , at zero temperature ,",
    "is @xmath37 indicating the fact that exactly half of the conductance is carried by elastic single - particle scattering events  @xcite .",
    "at nonzero temperature , @xmath2 can either be diminished , or be _ enhanced _ with a @xmath95 behavior .",
    "the enhancement is possible since the leading irrelevant operator near the fixed point allows single @xmath14-particle to single @xmath14-particle scattering .    in real experiments ,",
    "the propagating electrons are subjected to an external dephasing by the environment .",
    "we expect a reduction of the normalized visibility due to this external dephasing .",
    "assuming mostly thermal fluctuations in the environment ( nyquist noise ) , we roughly estimate a linear temperature dependence of the external dephasing .",
    "therefore , near the fermi liquid fixed points one might not be able to see the predicted @xmath96 reduction of @xmath2 . near the non - fermi liquid 2ck fixed point , however , the @xmath97 dependence is expected to be parametrically stronger than the external dephasing .",
    "thus we expect that measuring this effect would be possible in the presence of external dephasing .",
