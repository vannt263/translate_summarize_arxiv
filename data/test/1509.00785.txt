    "astronomical observations of the past decades reveal that there exists invisible non - baryonic matter ( dark matter , dm ) in the universe .",
    "exploring the nature of dm is one of the most important issues in astrophysics and cosmology today , and a variety of experiments have been carried out to directly detect dm particles .",
    "the most prominent candidate for dm is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , and most of the current experiments aim at detection of wimps .",
    "however , there are alternative candidates to account for the features of dm , and weakly interacting slim particles ( wisp ) , e.g. axion - like particles ( alp ) or hidden - sector photons ( hp ) , can be the main component of dm  @xcite .",
    "hidden photon cdm can be experimentally investigated via kinetic mixing @xmath3 between photons and hidden photons .",
    "for example , the axion dark matter experiment ( admx )  @xcite , which employs a resonant cavity and magnetic field to search for axion dark matter , also has sensitivity to hidden photon cdm , and its non - detection of the signal  @xcite was translated to the upper limit for the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a novel method with a spherical mirror to search for hp cdm was recently proposed  @xcite , with which wider mass - range can be probed without rearranging the set - up . in this method ,",
    "ordinary photons of energy @xmath4 induced by hp cdm via kinetic mixing are emitted in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the mirror , resulting in concentration of the power to the center of the mirror sphere .",
    "this method using a spherical reflector is extremely simple , and can be implemented relatively easily . to confirm its feasibility in real situations ,",
    "we planned and carried out two experiments to search for hp cdm in two different mass regions : one is for @xmath5 using optical equipments and the other for @xmath6 employing rf instruments .",
    "here we report on the preparations and the results of those searches for hp cdm using the dish method .",
    "r0.4     for the seach in @xmath7 , we need a spherical mirror and a photodetector . non - relativistic hps near the surface of a reflector induce emission of photons in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "a photodetector is placed at the point of convergence and detect emitted photons .",
    "we used a parabolic mirror as a ` dish ' .",
    "the parabolic mirror is 500 mm in diameter , 1007 mm focal length and the focal spot diameter is 1.5 mm .",
    "we used a parabolic surface instead of a spherical surface originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to reuse the mirror which had been employed in the solar hp helioscope  @xcite . from the diameter and the focal length of the parabolic mirror ,",
    "photons emitted perpendicularly to the surface are calculated to concentrate to a small area of 4 mm in diameter at twice the focal length of the mirror , which is small enough compared to the effective area of the photodetector .    a photomultiplier tube ( pmt )",
    "was employed as the detector of emitted photons .",
    "we selected hamamatsu photonics r3550p because of its low dark count rate of @xmath8 .",
    "we used a motorized stage to shift the position of the pmt , which enabled us to measure background noise .",
    "the mirror and the detector were mounted on a steel frame , which rigidly holds the arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pict ] ) . after installing optical equipments ,",
    "this frame was wrapped with black polyethylene sheets to shield from ambient light .",
    "additionally , whole the set - up was installed in a light - tight box of @xmath9 to attain higher light - tightness .    with this set - up , we carried out the experimental search for hp cdm in the ev mass range  @xcite .",
    "the overall duration of the measurement was @xmath10 for each with the pmt at the position of convergence of the hp cdm signal ( signal , s ) and at the position displaced by 25 mm from position s ( background , b ) .",
    "we found no excess in count rate measured at position s compared to at position b. we translated this non - detection result to the limit for the mixing parameter @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) .",
    "we also targeted detection in @xmath11 band ( @xmath12 ) for the feasibility test of the ` dish ' method .",
    "we can use commercially available dish antennas for this frequency region , though they usually have parabolic shape , which can not be approximated as spherical shape because of their short focal lengths compared to their diameters . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", we let our dish face a plane reflector , from which plane radio wave of hp cdm origin would be emitted perpendicularly to the surface . because parabolic dishes concentrate plane wave to their focal point , the amplification of hp cdm signal properly works .",
    "we used anstellar sxt-220 as a dish , which is 2.2 m diameter and designed for cs broadcast reception .",
    "a huge plane reflector was constructed by combining four alminum plates on a rigid frame . for the converter , we selected norsat 4506b , which down - converts the signal with the local frequency of 11 ghz .",
    "r0.45      the output of the converter was connected to the fft analyzer , rohde & schwarz fsv-4 .",
    "the signal of the existence of hp cdm would be seen as a spectral line with a broadening of @xmath13 due to the velocity dispersion of dm .",
    "after the calibration , the set - up for the experimetal search was constructed by setting the dish in front of the plane reflector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rf_pict ] ) .    using this set - up",
    ", we actually carried out the experimental search for four days .",
    "we observed no signal - like excess in the power spectrum and set an upper limit for the parameter @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) .",
    "although the limit is narrow in the sensitive mass region , we can expand it only by replacing the converter for the one which is capable of handling wider frequency range .",
    ", and the horizontal axis shows the mass of hidden - photon @xmath14 .",
    "the red colored regions are excluded by our results for two experimental set - ups . with the optical set - up , we excluded the area around @xmath5 .",
    "the search in @xmath15 band excluded the region around @xmath6 . for descriptions of other colored areas ,",
    "see ref .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we constructed two apparatus utilizing a novel method using a dish antenna .",
    "one uses an optical mirror for the survey in @xmath5 , and the other uses a dish antenna for cs broadcast reception to search hps with @xmath6 .",
    "we actually carried out the experimetal search , and found no evidence for the existence of hp cdm . from the result , we set upper limits on the photon - hp mixing parameter @xmath2 in two different mass regions ( fig .  [",
    "fig : result ] ) .",
