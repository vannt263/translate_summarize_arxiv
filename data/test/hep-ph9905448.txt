    "in contrast with finite - temperature qcd , qcd at high baryonic densities remains remarkably poorly understood .",
    "one of the main reasons is the lack of lattice simulations due to the complex fermion determinant in finite - density qcd .",
    "meanwhile , the physics in the core of the neutron stars , and possibly of heavy - ion collisions , depends crucially on the structure and properties of the ground state of qcd at finite densities .",
    "it was suggested that at sufficiently high densities , the ground state of qcd is a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "such state arises from the instability of the fermi surface under the formation of cooper pairs of quarks .",
    "the superconducting phase of quark matter is the subject of many recent studies @xcite and we will not discuss its properties in this paper .",
    "we will only note that a reliable treatment is currently available only in the perturbative regime of asymptotically high densities @xcite ; in the physically most interesting regime of moderate densities , qcd is strongly coupled and one has to resort to various toy models , e.g.  those with four - fermion interactions @xcite .    to shed light on possible new phases that may occur in the non - perturbative regime of moderate baryonic densities",
    ", one might hope to be able to make use of alternative limits , such as the large @xmath0 limit , where one takes the number of colors @xmath0 to infinity , keeping @xmath6 fixed ( @xmath7 is the gauge coupling ) @xcite .",
    "this limit has proved to be a convenient framework for understanding many properties of qcd ( for example , zweig rule ) , although qcd at infinite @xmath0 is still not analytically treatable . in the context of finite - density qcd ,",
    "the first work that discussed the implications of the large @xmath0 limit was done by deryagin , grigoriev , and rubakov ( dgr ) @xcite .",

    "as shown by dgr , this instability is not suppressed in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to see what happens to the dgr instability at large but finite @xmath0 .",
    "our motivation is to see whether the limit @xmath9 is relevant for the physics of high - density qcd at @xmath13 . in this paper",
    ", we find that at any fixed value of the chemical potential @xmath14 , in order for the dgr instability to occur we require the number of colors @xmath0 to be larger than some minimum value @xmath15 , which grows with @xmath14 .",
    "what is surprising is that even for moderate values of @xmath14 , the minimum value @xmath15 is very large ( of order of a few thousands for a modest chemical potential @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore one should not expect the large @xmath0 limit to be of direct relevance for physics with @xmath13 at finite densities .",

    "section [ sec : concl ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "let us review the key results of ref .  @xcite . throughout our paper",
    ", we assume all quarks are massless , and make no distinction between fermi momentum and fermi energy : @xmath17 . in the @xmath9 limit , the dgr result states that the fermi surface is unstable under the development of chiral waves with wavenumber @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a vector with modulus @xmath21 whose direction is fixed arbitrarily . since @xmath22 is a color singlet , it survives the limit @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath23    the condensate ( [ dgr ] ) can be interpreted as the formation of particle - hole pairs with total momentum @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pair ] ) .",
    "in such a pair , both the particle and the hole are near the fermi surface , and the momenta of the particle and the hole are both near @xmath20 . in this sense",
    "the condensate ( [ dgr ] ) is different from the usual chiral condensate @xmath25 , which corresponds to the pairing of a particle and a antiparticle moving in opposite directions . moving in the same directions ,",
    "the scattering between the particle and the hole is nearly in the foward direction , and since the amplitude of forward scattering is singular , one could expect the formation of the pair to be energetically favorable .",
    "in fact , this is the reason why the total momentum @xmath18 is special .",
    "the function @xmath26 has the physical meaning of the wave function of the pair in the center - of - mass frame , so @xmath27 is the momentum of the particle and @xmath28 is that of the hole .",
    "dgr found that the wave function is localized in an exponentially small region of momenta @xmath29 where @xmath30 recall that @xmath31 is kept constant in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "the binding energy of the pair is found to be at an even smaller scale , @xmath32 both scales @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parametrically larger than the non - perturbative scale @xmath35 . for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it may seem surprising that the dgr instability occurs in the perturbative regime .",
    "indeed , the analogs of ( [ dgr ] ) , in non - relativistic fermion systems , are the charge - density wave ( cdw ) and the spin - density wave ( sdw ) . since it is known that in three dimensions cdw and sdw do not develop at small four - fermion interaction",
    ", one could ask how such instability could occur at small @xmath6 .",
    "the key observation is that in our case the effective four - fermion interaction is singular due to the @xmath36 behavior of the gluon propagator at small @xmath37 .",
    "in general , this singularity is cut off by screening , but because the diagrams responsible for screening involve fermion loops , the screening effects at large @xmath0 are of order @xmath38 and therefore suppressed .",
    "this singular nature of the interaction explains why the dgr instability can occur perturbatively at large @xmath0 .",
    "the argument presented above also implies that at each value of the coupling @xmath31 , there must be a lower limit on @xmath0 , below which the interaction is not singular enough due to the screening , and the dgr instability disappears .",
    "this limit grows as one decreases @xmath31 , or , equivalently , as the chemical potential increases .",
    "finding this lower bound on @xmath0 as a function of @xmath14 is the purpose of this paper .",
    "before tackling our main problem , let us formulate an efficient rg technique that reproduces the results of dgr in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "while in the limit @xmath9 this technique does not give us anything new over what has been already found by dgr , it has the advantage that it can be applied to the case of finite @xmath0 , where the effects of screening make the generalization of the original method of ref .",
    "@xcite very difficult , if at all possible .",
    "we will not try to rigorously justify the rg in this paper .",
    "let us stay in the fermi liquid phase , where quarks are deconfined , and consider the scattering between a particle and a hole with momenta @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the total momentum of the pair is @xmath18 . a singularity of this scattering amplitude in the upper half of the complex energy plane would signify an exponentially growing mode , i.e. an instability @xcite . in terms of the diagrams , the most important contribution to the scattering amplitude comes from the ladder graphs ( fig.[fig : ladder ] ) . adding a rung to the ladder brings two more logarithms : one comes from the collinear divergence , i.e.  the singular gluon propagator , and the other from the fact that the two new fermion propagators are near the mass shell .",
    "we will design the rg to resum these double logs .",
    "@xmath39    our first step is to derive a 1 + 1 dimensional effective theory capable of describing the dgr instability . on the most naive level ,",
    "such description exists due to the fact that the modes of interest move in directions close to @xmath40 .",
    "technically , the ( 1 + 1)d effective theory arises from integrating , in each feynman graph , over the momentum components perpendicular to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "let us consider a ladder graph and ask what happens if one adds one more rung .",
    "the diagram now contains an extra loop integral , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fermion and gluon propagators respectively , and the dirac structure of the fermion propagators is ignored for the purposes of the discussion presented below .",
    "consider first the fermion line with momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the component of the fermion momentum parallel to @xmath20 will be denoted as @xmath44 , and those perpendicular to @xmath20 will be denoted as @xmath45 . note that @xmath45 is a two - dimensional vector .",
    "we will assume that for all fermion lines in the feynman diagram @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is an arbitrary momentum scale much less than @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , we will be interested only in the modes located inside two small `` patches '' on the fermi sphere , each having the size of order @xmath47 in directions perpendicular to @xmath20 ( eventually , @xmath47 will be identified with @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ dgr_delta ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath48 is also small compared to @xmath14 , the fermion propagator has the form @xmath49 if @xmath50 , the @xmath45 dependence drops out and the propagator is simply @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , in the regime @xmath52 , the fermion propagator does not depend on the perpendicular ( with respect to @xmath20 ) momenta . in this regime , in eq.([loop - int ] ) only the gluon propagator @xmath53 depends on @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the integration over @xmath45 has the form @xmath54 if @xmath55 and @xmath48 are not only small compared to @xmath14 , but also much smaller than @xmath47 , then the integral over @xmath45 in eq.([intparperp ] ) is a logarithmic one @xmath56 .",
    "the integral is cut off in the ir by @xmath48 and in the uv by @xmath47 and yields @xmath57 .",
    "effectively , this integration replaces the internal gluon line by a four - fermion vertex @xmath57 , where @xmath48 is determined by the momentum of the fermions coming in and out of the vertex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reduction ] ) . recall that the simplification takes place only in the region @xmath58 , as only in this region the integration over @xmath45 decouples from that over @xmath48 . at the end of this section we argue why the restriction of @xmath48 to the region @xmath59 is well justified .    @xmath60    we have taken the integration over the perpendicular components of one particular gluon momentum , but nothing prevents us from integrating over the perpendicular components of _ all _ the gluon momenta . by doing this integration , we resum one set of logarithms ( the one related to the collinear divergence ) in a series of double logs . now",
    ", as the only remaining integrals are over @xmath55 and @xmath48 , all feynman diagrams are identical to those of some 1 + 1 dimensional model with a four - fermion interaction .",
    "our task is to find out the precise form of the lagrangian of this model .",
    "first , we note that the kinetic term for the fermions in the effective theory can be obtained from the original lagrangian by omitting spatial derivatives in directions other than @xmath61 , @xmath62 it is more convenient , however , to recast the lagrangian ( [ 2dmid ] ) into the form of a ( 1 + 1)d theory of a doublet of dirac fermions ( which are two - component in ( 1 + 1)d ) at _ zero _ chemical potential .",
    "this is indeed possible , since spinless fermions at finite chemical potential can be rewritten as one dirac fermion at zero chemical potential ( the modes near two points of the `` fermi surface '' serve as its two components @xcite ) .",
    "it is not surprising that in our case the spin-@xmath63 fermions can be rewritten as a doublet of ( 1 + 1)d dirac fermions .",
    "let us do it explicitly when @xmath20 is directed along the @xmath61-axis , @xmath64 .",
    "denote the four components of the dirac spinor @xmath65 ( in chiral basis ) as @xmath66 .",
    "the antiparticles have energy of order @xmath18 and decouple from the low - energy effective theory that is being derived .",
    "this allows us to consider only the components of @xmath65 corresponding to particles , which are @xmath67 and @xmath68 when the particle s momentum is near @xmath20 , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 when it is near @xmath71 .",
    "although these fields are slowly varying in time , they still vary rapidly in space . to compensate for this spatial variation ,",
    "we introduce new fields , @xmath72 which are soft in both space and time .",
    "we can now translate from the ( 3 + 1)d language of @xmath65 to the ( 1 + 1)d language of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the kinetic part of the lagrangian ( [ 2dmid ] ) becomes @xmath75 what is the interaction term in the effective theory ?",

    "the theory ( [ eff_theory ] ) describes the interaction between fermions with perpendicular momenta of order @xmath47 and parallel momenta between @xmath83 and @xmath47 .    to understand the properties of the model ( [ eff_theory ] ) ,",
    "let us recall what is known about the conventional thirring model , where the interaction term is @xmath84 .",
    "the thirring model is asymptotically free .",

    "[ fig : zerosound ] .",
    "@xmath86    the running of the coupling @xmath87 is governed by the rg equation , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the rg parameter , and @xmath90 is the coupling at the energy scale @xmath91 .",
    "the coupling @xmath87 hits a landau pole at @xmath92 .",
    "the physics in the ir is characterized by the formation of the chiral condensate @xmath93 which gives mass to the fermions .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ phichi ] ) , one can see that @xmath94 , so a constant @xmath93 translates into space - dependent condensates @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these basic properties hold for the model ( [ eff_theory ] ) as well , but the estimation for the scale of the landau pole is different .",

    "now , it is easy to demonstrate why we were justified to consider only the region @xmath59 in the argument presented above . on one hand , when @xmath48 drops below the scale @xmath83",
    ", we can not neglect the dependence of the fermion propagator on @xmath45 , which now acts as a cut off for the rg flow .",
    "hence , for @xmath118 , there is no rg flow in the effective ( 1 + 1)d theory and the landau pole is never reached . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath48 becomes comparable with @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , we can not neglect @xmath48 dependence in the gluon propagator .",

    "having reproduced the dgr results by our rg procedure , let us turn to the case of large , but finite @xmath0 .",
    "the rg technique described above can be very easily extended to the case of large but finite @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of finite @xmath0 is to cut off the ir singularity of the gluon propagator at small momentum exchange by thomas - fermi screening and landau damping .",
    "the electric propagator becomes @xmath122 , and the magnetic propagator becomes @xmath123 @xcite , where @xmath124 is the thomas - fermi screening scale of order @xmath125 . if the screening mass @xmath124 is smaller than the scale of the landau pole found in sec .  [ sec : rg ] , i.e.  @xmath126 , then our previous calculations are not affected . however ,",
    "if @xmath127 , we need to modify the rg to take into account the screening .",
    "the screening affects the integration over perpendicular components of the gluon propagators : before these integrals were cut off by the parallel exchanged momentum @xmath48 , now it is cut off by the largest scale among @xmath48 and @xmath124 in the case of electric gluons , and among @xmath48 and @xmath128 in the case of magnetic gluons .",

    "in this paper we have seen that in finite - density qcd the fermi surface is unstable under the dgr instability in a finite range of chemical potential .",

    "this indicates that at low @xmath0 ( like @xmath13 ) , the dgr instability might not have a chance to realize itself at any value of the chemical potential and the only instability of the fermi surface is the bcs one , which leads to color superconductivity .",
    "returning to the case of very large @xmath0 , the next logical step is to ask what is the ground state once the fermi liquid is unstable under the dgr particle - hole pairing .",
    "this seems to be a purely academic exercise due to the large @xmath0 required , but it might still be interesting because of the possibility , at least in principle , of a new phase , distinct from the fermi liquid and bcs superconducting phases in 3d fermionic systems . in the original paper @xcite ,",
    "dgr constructed a `` standing chiral wave state '' , in which @xmath95 varies periodically in space with wavenumber @xmath18 .",
    "this state is periodic only along one spatial direction and does not break translational symmetry along the other two directions . since translational symmetry can not be broken in only one direction , such state can not be the ground state of qcd .",
    "one notices that a chiral wave with a particular wavevector utilizes only fermion modes in a small region with size @xmath33 ( eq.([dgr_delta ] ) ) near two opposite points on the fermi sphere .",
    "it is clear how to make a state with energy smaller than the original dgr standing wave state .",
    "indeed , one can pair up particles and holes in different pairs of opposite patches on the fermi sphere . since the size of each patch is exponentially small compared to the total area of the fermi surface",
    ", one can have a large number of patches that do not overlap with each other . from the size of the patches one deduces that one can place a maximum of @xmath162 patches on the sphere .",
    "the condensate has the form of a linear combination of @xmath163 , where all @xmath164 have modulus equal to @xmath18 but point in different directions .",
    "it is easy to estimate the energy gain from forming such a state .",
    "indeed , the pairing affects fermions in a thin shell near the fermi surface ; the thickness of the shell is the scale at which we have found the landau pole , i.e.  @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the fraction of fermions affected is @xmath162 , and each pair lowers the energy by @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , the gain in energy density is @xmath166 for comparison , the dgr standing wave state has the energy gain @xmath167 .",
    "the factor of @xmath162 difference is explained by the fact that dgr state involves only two patches on the fermi surface with a relative area of @xmath162 .",
    "alternatively , it might be energetically more favorable for the patches on the fermi sphere to be overlapping .",
    "in this case , a given particle ( or hole ) near the fermi sphere participates in many pairings simultaneously .",
    "it could be expected that the binding energy of each individual pair is lower than the value it would have in the non - overlapping case , but nothing can be said about the total energy of the system .",

    "further investigation is required to find the true ground state of qcd at very large @xmath0 .    finally , let us note an interesting possibility that the ground state of finite - density qcd at very large @xmath0 might be similar to the `` tomographic luttinger liquid '' in 2d , advocated by anderson as the normal state of high-@xmath168 cuprates @xcite .",
    "such similarity could stem from the singular interaction between fermions moving in the same directions , which is also characteristic of tomographic luttinger liquids .",
