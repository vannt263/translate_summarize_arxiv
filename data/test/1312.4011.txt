    "we allow the on - site hubbard interaction to have a spin - dependent interaction : @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is a two - component bosonic annihilation operator at the site @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the spin - independent nearest neighbor tunneling , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the on - site interaction between bosons of the same ( different ) spin @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the chemical potential . in the last term",

    "the tunneling and rashba terms induce two _ different _ types of superfluidity .",
    "to see this we plot the spin - independent tunneling and spin - dependent tunneling in fig .",
    "[ hoppingsfig ] .",
    "the left panel shows that the spin - independent tunneling favors phase uniformity since @xmath35 is real .",
    "but in the right panel we see that soc has two effects : it induces tunneling between neighboring sites with two different spin states and it imposes phase variation .",
    "the phase variation depends strongly on the direction of the neighboring sites .",
    "soc therefore favors highly anisotropic superfluid states . without soc",
    "the system has at least an @xmath46 symmetry , which means that the total number of each species are conserved ; however , soc introduces spin flips between two neighboring sites , thus the system only respects @xmath47 symmetry and , as a result , the phase difference between the neighboring sites can not be gauged out .",
    "the competition between spin - independent tunneling and spin - dependent tunneling tunes the transition between these different superfluids and can therefore be a first order process .    in the weakly interacting limit the model exhibits three different superfluid phases :",
    "in the regime when spin - independent tunneling dominates ( @xmath48 ) , the uniform superfluid is preferred and the total momentum of the superfluid is zero ; in the opposite regime , a staggered superfluid phase is preferred ; and in the intermediate regime , @xmath49 , the strong competition between the two tunnelings gives rise to superfluids with phase patterns that depend strongly on boundary effects .",
    "strong interactions add competing mott insulating phases and complicates estimates of the phase diagram . to study the competition between all ground states we use two complimentary mean field approaches .",
    "we apply the gutzwiller mean field method to finite system sizes ( relevant to experiments ) and compare with an otherwise equivalent mean field method applied to infinite system sizes .",
    "we now discuss the gutzwiller mean field method @xcite .",
    "the method assumes a product ground state of the form : @xmath50 .",
    "this form for the wavefunction has been extensively applied to bosons in optical lattices @xcite , even in the presence of complex hopping amplitudes @xcite .",
    "it generally gives quantitatively reliable results in 2d and 3d , ( for comparisons , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and is a particularly excellent approximation when computing local correlation functions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "niederle:2013 ) .",

    "we assume @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a real number .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the assumed form for @xmath60 but works best on infinite system sizes .",

    "an important point here is that the total energy depends not only on the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath59 , but also on the phase difference between neighboring sites .",
    "we see that the minimal energy @xmath66 corresponds to a maximal value of @xmath67 and @xmath68 when @xmath36 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath35 assume positive values ( the case studied in this paper ) . here",
    "@xmath67 depends only on the phase difference between the same spin states , while @xmath68 depends strongly on the phase difference between spin up and spin down states in the neighboring sites .",
    "the competition between @xmath67 and @xmath68 governs competition between superfluids with distinct phase patterns . obviously , when @xmath71 , @xmath67 takes its maximum value when all of the sites have the same phase , which corresponds to the uniform superfluid phase .",
