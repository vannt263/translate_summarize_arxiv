    "developing a statistical mechanical description of dense granular materials , structural and colloidal glasses , and other jammed systems @xcite composed of discrete macroscopic grains is a difficult , long - standing problem .",
    "these amorphous systems possess an enormously large number of possible jammed configurations ; however , it is not known with what probabilities these configurations occur since these systems are not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the possible jammed configurations do not occur with equal probability  in fact , some are extremely rare and others are highly probable . moreover , the likelihood that a given jammed configuration occurs depends on the protocol that was used to generate it .    despite difficult theoretical challenges ,",
    "there have been a number of experimental and computational studies that have investigated jammed configurations in a variety of systems .",
    "the experiments include studies of static packings of ball bearings @xcite , slowly shaken granular materials @xcite , sedimenting colloidal suspensions @xcite , and compressed colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies include early monte carlo simulations of dense liquids @xcite , collision dynamics of growing hard spheres @xcite , serial deposition of granular materials under gravity @xcite , various geometrical algorithms @xcite , compression and expansion of soft particles followed by energy minimization @xcite , and other relaxation methods @xcite .",
    "the early experimental and computational studies found that dense amorphous packings of smooth , hard particles frequently possess packing fractions near random close packing @xmath6 , which is approximately @xmath7 in @xmath8 monodisperse systems @xcite and @xmath9 in the @xmath10 bidisperse systems discussed in this work @xcite .",
    "however , more recent studies have emphasized that the packing fraction attained in jammed systems can depend on the process used to create them .",
    "different protocols select particular configurations from a distribution of jammed states with varying degrees of positional and orientational order @xcite .",
    "recent studies of hard particle systems have also shown that different classes of jammed states exist with different properties @xcite .",
    "for example , in _ locally _ jammed ( lj ) states , each particle is unable to move provided all other particles are held fixed ; however , groups of particles can still move collectively . in contrast , in collectively jammed ( cj ) states neither single particles nor groups of particles are free to move ( excluding ` floater ' particles that do not have any contacts ) .",
    "thus , cj states are more ` jammed ' than lj states .    in this article",
    "we focus exclusively on the properties of collectively jammed states .",
    "these states are created using an energy minimization procedure @xcite for systems composed of particles that interact via soft , finite - range , purely repulsive , and spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "energy minimization is combined with successive compressions and decompressions of the system to find states that can not be further compressed without producing an overlap of the particles . as explained in sec .",
    "[ methods ] , this procedure yields collectively jammed states of the equivalent hard - particle system .    in previous studies of collectively jammed states created using the energy minimization method",
    ", we showed that the probability distribution of collectively jammed packing fractions narrows as the system size increases and becomes a @xmath11-function located at @xmath12 in the infinite system - size limit @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath12 was similar to values quoted previously for random close packing @xcite .",
    "the narrowing of the distribution of cj packing fractions as the system size increases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : td_largen ] for 2d bidisperse systems .",
    "however , it is still not clear why this happens .",
    "why it is so difficult to obtain a collectively jammed state with @xmath13 in the large system limit ?",
    "one possibility is that very few collectively jammed states exist with @xmath14 .",
    "another possibility is that collectively jammed states do exist over a range of packing fractions , but only those with packing fractions near @xmath12 are very highly probable .",
    "below , we will address this question and other related problems by studying the distributions of collectively jammed states in small bidisperse systems in 2d .",
    "for such systems we we will be able to generate nearly all of the collectively jammed states .",
    "enumeration of nearly all cj states will allow us to decompose the probability density @xmath1 to obtain a collectively jammed state at a particular packing fraction @xmath2 into two contributions @xmath15 the factor @xmath3 in the above equation represents the density of collectively jammed states ( i.e. , @xmath16 measures how many distinct collectively jammed states exist within in a small range of packing fractions @xmath17 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath18 denotes the effective frequency ( i.e. , the counts averaged over a small region of @xmath2 ) with which these states occur .",
    "we note that the density of states @xmath3 is determined solely by the topological features of configurational space ; it is thus independent of the the protocol used to generate these states .",
    "in contrast , the quantity @xmath4 is protocol dependent , because it records the average frequency with which a cj state at @xmath2 occurs for a given protocol .",
    "for example , for algorithms that allow partial thermal equilibration during compression and expansion , the frequency distributions are shifted to larger @xmath2 compared to those that do not involve such equilibration .",
    "the decomposition ( [ factorization of probability density ] ) will allow us to determine which contribution , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , controls the shape of the probability distribution @xmath1 in the large system limit .",
    "others have studied the inherent structures of hard - sphere liquids and glasses , but have not addressed this specific question @xcite",
    ". we will show below that @xmath3 controls the width of the distribution of cj states in the infinite system - size limit .",
    "we also have some evidence that the location of the peak in @xmath1 in the large @xmath19 limit is also determined by the large @xmath19 behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "we will also argue that for many procedures the protocol - dependence of the frequency distribution @xmath4 is too weak to substantially shift the peak in @xmath1 for large systems .",
    "thus , our results suggest that for a large class of algorithms the location of the peak in @xmath1 can be used as a protocol - independent definition of random close packing in the infinite system size limit .",
    "our goal is to enumerate the collectively jammed configurations in 2d bidisperse systems composed of smooth , repulsive disks .",
    "we will focus on bidisperse mixtures composed of @xmath20 large and @xmath20 small particles with a diameter ratio @xmath21 because it has been shown that these systems do not easily crystallize or phase separate @xcite .",

    "since the number of collectively jammed states grows so rapidly with @xmath19 , we are not able to calculate a large fraction of the cj states for @xmath29 , but as we will show below , we can still make strong conclusions about the shape of the distribution of cj states in large systems .",
    "we utilize an energy - minimization procedure to create collectively jammed states @xcite .",

    ", the procedure begins by choosing a random configuration of @xmath19 particles at an initial packing fraction @xmath40 in a square box with unit length and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the positions of the centers of the particles are uncorrelated and distributed uniformly in the box .",
    "we have found that the results do not depend on the initial volume fraction @xmath40 as long it is significantly below the peak in @xmath3 .",
    "we chose @xmath41 for most system sizes .",
    "after initializing the systems , we find the nearest local potential energy minimum using the conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite .",
    "we terminate the energy minimization procedure when either of the following two conditions is satisfied : 1 ) two successive conjugate gradient steps @xmath42 and @xmath43 yield nearly the same total potential energy per particle , @xmath44 or 2 ) the total potential energy per particle is extremely small , @xmath45 .",
    "following the potential energy minimization , we decide whether the system should be compressed or expanded to find the jamming threshold .",
    "if @xmath46 , particles have nonzero overlap and thus small and large particles are reduced in size by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . if , on the other hand , @xmath49 , the system is below the jamming threshold and all particles are thus increased in size . after the system has been expanded or compressed , it is relaxed using potential energy minimization and the process is repeated . each time the procedure switches from expansion to contraction or vice versa ,",
    "the packing fraction increment @xmath50 is reduced by a factor of @xmath51 .",
    "the initial expansion rate was @xmath52 .",
    "when the total potential energy per particle falls within the range @xmath53 , the process is terminated and the ` jammed ' packing fraction is recorded .",
    "if the final state contains floater particles with @xmath51 or fewer contacts , we remove them , minimize the total potential energy , and slightly compress or expand the remaining particles to find the jamming threshold .",
    "note that the final configurations are slightly compressed with overlaps in the range @xmath54 .",
    "we have verified that our results do not depend strongly on the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    for each system - size @xmath19",
    ", this process is repeated using @xmath58 independent random initial conditions and the resulting jammed configurations are analyzed to determine whether they are collectively jammed and unique .",
    "to verify if a given final configuration is collectively jammed we analyze the eigenvalue spectra of the dynamical ( or rigidity ) matrix @xcite , @xmath59 , where the indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to the particles and @xmath60 represent the cartesian coordinates . for a system with @xmath61 floaters and @xmath62 particles forming a connected network the indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 range from @xmath63 to @xmath64",
    "thus , the dynamical matrix has @xmath65 rows and columns , where @xmath66 is the spatial dimension . by differentiating the interparticle potential",
    "we find that the elements of the dynamical matrix with @xmath67 are given by @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while those with @xmath71 are given by @xmath72    the dynamical matrix ( [ offdiagonal ] ) and ( [ diagonal ] ) has @xmath65 real eigenvalues @xmath73 , @xmath74 of which are zero due to translational invariance of the system . in a collectively jammed state",
    "no set of particle displacements is possible without creating an overlapping configuration ; therefore the dynamical matrix has exactly @xmath75 nonzero eigenvalues . in our simulations we use the criterion @xmath76 for nonzero eigenvalues , where @xmath77 is the noise threshold for our eigenvalue calculations .",
    "we note that our energy minimization algorithm for creating jammed states does occasionally yield a configuration that is not collectively jammed .",

    "the number of trials that yield collectively jammed states out of the original @xmath58 trials is denoted @xmath78 .",
    "the fraction of trials that give locally but not collectively jammed states @xmath79 decreases with increasing system size from @xmath80 at @xmath81 to less than @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "we determine whether two collectively jammed states are distinct by comparing the sorted lists of the nonzero eigenvalues of their respective dynamical matrices .",
    "if the relative difference between two corresponding eigenvalues differs by more than @xmath84 , the configurations are treated as distinct . by comparing the topology of the network of particle contacts in a representative sample of cj states",

    "this procedure allows us to determine the number @xmath85 of distinct collectively jammed states at each fixed number of independent trials @xmath78 . as expected , if two cj states have different packing fractions , they are distinct , with different contact networks and dynamical modes",

    "the packing - fraction difference of @xmath86 already assures that the two states are distinct .",

    "we also found that even over a narrow range of @xmath2 , the frequency with which particular cj states occur is strongly nonuniform and involves a large number of exponentially rare states .",
    "finally , we have shown that @xmath1 becomes gaussian in the large @xmath19 limit .",
    "since @xmath160 and @xmath4 is exponential , we expect that @xmath3 is also gaussian and controls the width of @xmath1 for large @xmath19 .",
    "we also have preliminary results that suggest that the contribution from @xmath4 to the shift of the peak in @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "we expect that @xmath3 will determine the location of the peak in @xmath1 in the large @xmath19 limit , and thus it is a robust protocol - independent definition of random close packing in this system .",
    "several interesting questions have arisen from this work that will be addressed in our future studies .",
    "first , we have shown that the frequency with which cj states occur is highly nonuniform .",
    "it is important to ask whether the rare states can be neglected in analyses of static and dynamic properties of jammed and nearly jammed systems .",
    "for example , we have shown that @xmath1 is insensitive to the fraction @xmath112 of cj states obtained and thus @xmath1 is not influenced by the rare cj states . however , rare cj states may be important in determining the _ dynamical _ properties of jammed and glassy systems if these states are associated with ` passages ' or ` channels ' from one frequently occurring state to another . moreover",
    ", an analysis of the density of states and the frequency distribution ( both as a function of @xmath2 and locally in @xmath161 may shed light on the phase space evolution of glassy systems during the aging process .",
    "a closely related question is what topological or geometrical features of configurational phase space give rise to the exponentially varying frequency distribution ?",
    "can one , for example , uniquely assign a specific volume in configurational space to each jammed state ?",
    "a candidate for such a quantity is the volume @xmath162 of configuration space in which each point is connected by a continuous path without particle overlap to a particular cj state .",
    "it is likely that those cj states with large @xmath162 will occur frequently for a typical compaction algorithm , while those with small @xmath162 will be rare .",
    "another important question is whether the results for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 found in 2d bidisperse systems also hold for other systems such as _ monodisperse _ systems in 2d and 3d .",
    "does @xmath3 still control the behavior of @xmath1 or does the frequency distribution play a more dominant role in determining @xmath1 ? to begin to address these questions , we have enumerated nearly all of the distinct collectively jammed states and calculated @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath163 in small 2d periodic cells containing @xmath22 to @xmath117 equal - sized particles .",
    "in our preliminary studies , we have found several significant differences between 2d monodisperse and bidisperse systems , which largely stem from the fact that partially ordered states occur frequently in the monodisperse systems .",
    "first , in 2d monodisperse systems there is an abundance of distinct cj states that exist at the same packing fraction .",
    "for example , in a monodisperse systems with @xmath164 , multiple distinct states occur at @xmath165 of the cj packing fractions compared to less than @xmath82 in bidisperse systems with @xmath166 .",
    "second , for the system sizes studied , quantitative features of the distributions of cj states depend on whether @xmath19 is even or odd .",
    "third , @xmath1 can possess _ two _ strong peaks .",
    "for example , two peaks in @xmath1 occur at @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath164 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monon24 ] .",
    "moreover , the large-@xmath2 peak that corresponds to partially ordered configurations is a factor of three taller than the small-@xmath2 peak that corresponds to amorphous configurations .",
    "finally , the maximum in @xmath4 coincides with the large-@xmath2 peak in @xmath1 and @xmath4 decays very rapidly as @xmath2 decreases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monon24 ] , the rapid decay of @xmath4 significantly suppresses the contribution of the peak in @xmath3 to the total distribution @xmath1 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 , which depends on the protocol used to generate the cj states , may strongly influence the total distribution @xmath1 even in moderately sized 2d monodisperse systems .",
    "many open questions concerning monodisperse systems in 2d will be answered in a forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "we will measure the shape of @xmath1 as a function of system size and predict whether @xmath3 or @xmath4 controls the width and location of the peak ( or peaks ) in the large @xmath19 limit .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 strongly influences @xmath1 at small and moderate system sizes explains why it has been so difficult to determine random close packing in 2d monodisperse systems @xcite  different protocols have yielded different values for @xmath6 @xcite .",
