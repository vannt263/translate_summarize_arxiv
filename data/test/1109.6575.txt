    "there are two distinct requirements for describing quantum mechanical systems of particles under the requirements of special relativity .",
    "the first requirement is poincar invariance : probabilities , expectation values and ensemble averages for equivalent experiments performed in different inertial frames are identical .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum theory to be poincar invariant is that the dynamics is described by a unitary representation of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "the second requirement is cluster separability : isolated subsystems must have the same observable properties as they would in a framework in which the other `` spectator '' particles are absent entirely .",
    "this requirement justifies tests of special relativity on isolated subsystems .",
    "it applies both to systems of particles interacting among themselves ( e.g.  via the strong interaction ) and to the current operators that allow them to interact with external fields .",
    "there is more than one way to implement the requirements of poincar invariance in a quantum system , and cluster separability is not necessarily an automatic consequence of the implementation . in local quantum field theory ,",
    "poincar invariance and cluster separability are satisfied formally as a consequence of the covariance , spectral properties and the local commutation relations of the field operators . for systems amenable to perturbation methods",
    ", these properties can still hold . for non - perturbative systems ( such as those based on the strong interaction ) controlled approximations are replaced by a truncation or an expansion scheme , which replaces an infinite hierarchy of coupled non - linear field equations with a more tractable finite subset , and which may be valid only in restricted parameter domains .",
    "these schemes may still exhibit lorentz covariance , but cluster separability does not automatically follow , and must be demonstrated on a case - by - case basis that depends on the scheme .",
    "an alternative implementation of poincar invariance in a few - body system involves direct construction of the dynamical representations of the poincar group in the presence interactions with a finite number of particle ( rather than field ) degrees of freedom .",
    "such a construction was originally studied by dirac  @xcite , and bakamjian and thomas  @xcite provided an explicit construction of the generators for a system of two interacting particles .",
    "many realistic , poincar invariant , quantum mechanical models of strongly interacting few - body systems are based on a generalization of the bakamjian - thomas construction @xcite . this construction can be used to construct models of systems of arbitrary numbers of particles and systems that do not conserve particle number .",
    "a representative sample of few - body applications of poincar invariant quantum mechanics based on the bakamjian - thomas construction includes relativistic constituent quark models @xcite , relativistic few - nucleon models @xcite , relativistic models involving electromagnetic probes @xcite , and relativistic models with particle production @xcite .",
    "the virtue of the bakamjian - thomas construction is that it provides a means for constructing poincar generators for systems of interacting particles , and where the problems have a finite number of degrees of freedom and are in principle solvable .",
    "the limitation of this construction is that for systems of more than two particles , the dynamical representation of the poincar group does not become a tensor product on states representing asymptotically separated subsystems . while this limitation does not lead to observable consequences in the three - body @xmath0-matrix or bound - state observables , there are observable consequences when the three - body system is embedded in the four - particle hilbert space , as it is in four - body problems .",
    "the most ambitious applications of the bakamjian - thomas construction are relativistic faddeev calculations  @xcite of three - nucleon scattering , which have been performed using realistic nucleon - nucleon forces and three - nucleon forces .",
    "the next step in developing a relativistic few - body theory would be to model four - nucleon systems or electron scattering from a three - nucleon system . in both of these applications",
    "a three - nucleon subsystem is embedded in a four - particle hilbert space , and , for the first time , there is the possibility of observable consequences of violations of cluster properties .",
    "the restoration of cluster properties can be achieved through a recursive construction due to sokolov @xcite .",
    "the sokolov construction generates a dynamical representation of the poincar group satisfying cluster properties using of a hierarchy of unitary transformations , each of which preserves the @xmath0 matrix while transforming tensor products of subsystem representations of the poincar group to representations where the interactions can be added in a manner that preserves the underlying poincar symmetry .",
    "the bakamjian - thomas representation is retrieved by setting the relevant unitary transformations to the identity operator .",
    "the sokolov construction is non - trivial and the unitary transformations depend upon the interactions .",
    "an isolated three - body system is a special case where the cluster property can be achieved by means of a single overall unitary transformation that preserves the @xmath0 matrix . for systems of more than three particles",
    "there are observable differences between the @xmath0 matrices in the two representations .",
    "the interested reader can find a complete discussion in @xcite .",
    "the construction of the sokolov hierarchy of unitary transformations is sufficiently complicated that the technique has never been used in realistic calculations . before undertaking computationally intensive four - body calculations",
    ", one would like to know the importance of the corrections required by cluster properties . while ref .",
    "@xcite argued that these corrections should be small in nuclear physics applications , this was never quantified in any model calculations . an additional investigation is needed to determine if these corrections can be ignored , can be treated perturbatively , or must be treated exactly . to address this question",
    "we construct a model involving matrix elements of a scalar probe for a system of three particles .",
    "the model is simple enough that both poincar invariance and cluster separability are easily satisfied ; this unusual pair of features is due to the simplicity of the test model . at the same time",
    "the model is sufficiently rich that it permits an equivalent bakamjian - thomas treatment of the three - body system that illustrates the quantitative impact of the breakdown of cluster separability in this four - body problem .",
    "the conclusion of our preliminary analysis suggests that the corrections required by cluster properties are too small to be observable in nuclear physics applications .",
    "the corrections are more important for models based on sub - nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "in a few - body quantum mechanical model the requirement of cluster separability means that the poincar generators @xmath1 that generate time translations , translations , rotations , and rotationless lorentz transformations and current operators @xmath2 have cluster expansions of the form h= _",
    "i h_i + _ ij h_ij + _ jk h_ijk + = _ i _ i + _ ij _ ij + _ ijk _ ijk + = _ i _ i + _ ij _ ij + _ ijk _ ijk",

    "these constraints are realized in the sokolov construction , but they are not generally satisfied by the bakamjian - thomas construction .",
    "the sokolov construction generates all of the many - body operators that appear in these cluster expansions as functions of input two - body interactions .",
    "these interactions are necessary to preserve the poincar commutation relations in the presence of interactions .",
    "poincar invariance and the dirac forms of dynamics for bakamian - thomas ( @xmath5 ) constructions are discussed extensively in ref .",
    "the framework provided here makes use of that discussion .",
    "conceptually , the bakamjian - thomas construction defines the dynamics in the rest frame of the non - interacting system and then uses simultaneous eigenstates of the mass and spin ( casimir operators for the poincar group ) to construct unitary representations of the poincar group .",
    "we approach the model in a heuristic way in order to illustrate the issue of cluster separability combined with poincar invariance with a minimum of formal development .    a simple four - body model where we can observe the breakdown of cluster separability consists of a system of three spinless particles interacting with an external probe that represents the presence of a fourth particle .",
    "the relevant dynamical quantities are matrix elements of a one - body scalar density between eigenstates of the three - body four - momentum operator .",
    "we will see that , even for this simple model , there are differences in matrix elements of the scalar density calculated using three - body eigenstates of a @xmath5 four - momentum operator compared to matrix elements calculated using three - body eigenstates of a four - momentum operator that clusters .",
    "our simplifying assumptions show that the violation of cluster properties has nothing to do with particle spins , or properties of more realistic probes like four - current densities .",
    "the scalar density operator , @xmath6 , is assumed to be a one - body operator .",
    "the three - particle system consists of a bound pair ( which we label the ( 12 ) subsystem ) and a third particle ( 3 which we call the struck particle ) that does not interact with particles 1 or 2 .",
    "only particle 3 interacts with the scalar density @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the ( 12 ) subsystem acts as a spectator with respect to the action of the probe .",
    "this can be illustrated by disconnected graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "in the following sections we will calculate matrix elements of the density operator in this simple system using the bakamjian - thomas unitary representation of the poincar group , and compare them with a result that exhibits manifest cluster separability . the latter result is possible only because of the simplicity of the model .      for the simple system introduced above , the unitary representation of the poincar group is a tensor product of a two - body representation on a two - particle hilbert space and a one - particle representation acting on a one - body hilbert space . in this section",
    "we consider a three - body eigenstate that is a tensor product of bound ( 12 ) eigenstate and a one - particle eigenstate @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the mass eigenvalue @xmath10 of the bound state of the interacting two - body mass operator , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is its three - momentum , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mass and momentum of particle 3 . since the scalar density @xmath6 acts only in the space of particle 3 , the matrix element has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the four - momentum transferred to particle 3 and @xmath18 .",

    "the result is just the invariant form factor of particle 3 multiplied by its mass .",
    "the representation for a three - particle system becomes a tensor product of a one - body and two - body representation of the poincar group whenever the interactions involving one of the particles is set to zero .",
    "this implies that the generators have the form ( [ eq : b1 ] ) .",
    "ideally one would simply perform all calculations using the @xmath7 representation .",
    "however , for examples beyond the simple model presented here , it is a highly non - trivial task to obtain a tensor - product representation that preserves poincar invariance .",

    "figures  [ fig : mt - be - par ] and  [ fig : mt - be - perp ] show the results of calculations for varying binding energy with a malfliet - tjon wave function .    as with the earlier cases that employed the bound - state binding energy ,",
    "the fractional deviation of the @xmath5 results from the @xmath7 benchmark is quite small , of order @xmath115 or less .",
    "we also examined sensitivity to the momentum scale , @xmath116 , of the wave function by replacing the malfliet - tjon wave function with a gaussian form : @xmath117 figures  [ fig : gaussian - par ] and  [ fig : gaussian - perp ] show the results for the spectator momentum perpendicular and parallel to the momentum transfer in all three forms of dynamics .",

    "formally dynamical relativistic models should be poincar invariant and satisfy cluster properties ; in addition operators associated with short ranged physical phenomena should have well defined cluster expansions .    while our model is considerably simpler than a realistic model of a three - nucleon system interacting with an electron , the difference between the bakamjian - thomas formulation of the model and the model that clusters properly is due entirely to the same unitary transformations discussed in our simplified model .",
    "this difference vanishes in the limit that these transformations become the identity .",
    "the analysis in this paper established that these operators , which implicitly depend on the interactions , are close to the identity for interactions with typical nuclear physics scales for binding energy and fermi momentum .",
    "this provides a strong justification for applying bakamjian - thomas construction of dynamical representations poincar group to system of more than three nucleons .",
    "our results indicate that bakamjian - thomas models , which explicitly satisfy the requirements of poincar invariance , can be utilized in typical nuclear physics problems with minimal quantitative error due to the lack of cluster separability using any of dirac s front - form dynamics .",
    "the final set of figures show the results of calculations with scales that are more appropriate models of hadrons based on sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we note here that confinement precludes separating arbitrary subsystems by large distance scales , so the requirement of cluster separability is irrelevant for models of individual hadrons .",
    "the issue may be relevant , however , for systems of hadrons described by sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "in these cases , in order to understand the relevant scales , we replace the particle  3 mass in the above calculations by a  constituent quark  mass of 220 mev , and consider two - body ( `` diquark '' ) masses ranging from 200 to 600 mev for gaussian wave functions with a 1  @xmath118 scale in figs .",

    "14 and 15 .",
    "the results are similar to those appropriate to nuclear physics discussed above , except that the scale of deviation from the @xmath7 benchmark is on the scale of 10% for the instant , front and point - form @xmath25s .",
    "this not surprising given that the mass / momentum scale variation for these calculations is much higher than for typical cases in nuclear physics with nucleons .",
    "while these corrections may be relevant , multi - hadron models based on sub - nucleon degrees of freedom have not been developed to a precision where these effects could be identified .",
    "bakamjian - thomas formulations , which explicitly satisfy the requirements of poincar invariance , do not satisfy cluster separability above the three - particle level , i.e.  in systems that involve three - body subsystems whose total momentum must vary .",
    "the cluster properties can be restored via a hierarchy of unitary transformations .",
    "these transformations depend upon the full solution of a three - body problem , and are difficult to implement in practice .    rather than attempt to calculate directly the size of these unitary transformations ( e.g.  the difference of matrix elements from those of the unit operator ) , we have developed a simple model in which the exact result consistent with cluster separability is known , and then compare to it the results of bakamjian - thomas calculations .",
    "the quantities that we investigate are sensitive to the part of these unitary transformations that restore cluster properties .",
    "we conclude from these model studies that bakamjian - thomas models , which explicitly satisfy the requirements of poincar invariance , can be utilized in typical nuclear physics problems with minimal quantitative error due to the lack of cluster separability .",
    "we also examined models utilizing mass / momentum scales appropriate for quark models .",
    "confinement precludes separating arbitrary subsystems by large distance scales , so the general requirement of cluster separability is irrelevant for models of individual hadrons .",
    "the issue may be relevant , however , for systems of hadrons described by subnucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "in such cases , the deviations from the model benchmark are larger ( about 10% ) than those for typical nuclear physics calculations with nucleons , though they are still small compared to model uncertainties ."
