    "wormhole solutions are necessarily associated with violations of the energy conditions @xcite , namely the existence of exotic matter .",
    "being a problematic issue , it is useful to minimize the usage of exotic matter , although energy condition violations in quantum field theory are well known @xcite .",
    "thus , one may concentrate the exotic matter to a thin - shell localized at the throat , using a simple and elegant class of wormhole solutions implemented by matt visser using the cut - and - paste construction @xcite .",
    "the surface stress - energy tensor components of the exotic matter at the throat are determined , invoking the darmois - israel formalism @xcite .",
    "this construction also permits one to explore a dynamical analysis of the wormhole throat .",
    "poisson and visser analyzed a thin - shell wormhole @xcite , constructed by pasting together two copies of the schwarzschild solution at @xmath1 . considering a linearized radial perturbation around a static solution , in the spirit of @xcite , regions of stability were discovered , which lie in a somewhat unexpected patch .",
    "this is due to the fact that one does not have a detailed microphysical model for exotic matter , in fact , nothing is known on equations of state of exotic matter .",
    "see discussion in poisson - visser @xcite",
    ". building on this , eiroa and romero @xcite analyzed charged thin - shell wormholes and found that the regions of stability are greatly increased for large values of charge .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant is also an issue that has been extensively analyzed in the literature .",
    "for instance , kim @xcite analyzed schwarzschild - de sitter wormholes , using the cut - and - paste construction .",
    "considering specific equations of state the role of the cosmological constant in the classical and quantum stabilities was studied .",
    "this analysis was a natural extension of the schwarzschild wormhole solution discussed in @xcite .",
    "later , kim and collaborators @xcite discussed the @xmath2-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter wormhole , where once again taking into account specific equations of state , the respective dynamical stability of this type of wormhole was discussed .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath3-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter wormhole and the @xmath2-dimensional discussed in @xcite was established . a partial stability analysis of a @xmath2-dimensional wormhole solution , in the presence of @xmath4 ,",
    "was explored by delgaty and mann @xcite , in which the simple case of a constant line energy density was considered .",
    "more recently , prompted by the randall - sundrum brane world scenario @xcite , where our universe is viewed as a domain wall in five dimensional anti - de sitter space , kraus @xcite analyzed the dynamics of @xmath5-dimensional anti - de sitter domain walls .",
    "the motion of the wall was determined using the darmois - israel formalism .",
    "the possible wall trajectories were described and the consequences for localized gravity on the wall were examined .",
    "anchordoqui @xcite considered the dynamics of the simple case of onebranes in @xmath6-dimensional anti - de sitter space and generalized the previous analysis for an arbitrary number of dimensions , studying the quantum behaviour within the context of the wkb approximation . using the standard linearization analysis , anchordoqui and",
    "olsen @xcite studied the classical stability and different behaviours for the expansion of the universe by imposing constraints on the speed of sound , within @xmath7-dimensional anti - de sitter background spaces .",
    "the formation of black holes due to the gravitational collapse of matter trapped on the brane , within the context of the randall - sundrum models was discussed in @xcite .",
    "chamblin conjectured that a non - rotating uncharged black hole on the domain wall is described by a _ black cigar _ solution in five dimensions .",

    "a great deal of attention on the issue of gravity on the brane within the randall - sundrum scenario has also been devoted to the cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spherically symmetric and static traversable wormholes in the presence of a generic cosmological constant , @xmath4 , were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "a matching of an interior solution to the unique exterior vacuum solution was carried out , and the respective structure and several physical properties and characteristics due to @xmath4 were explored .",
    "specific cases of thin shells at the matching due to the effects of the cosmological constant were studied . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate the exotic matter to the wormhole throat , generalizing the poisson - visser analysis for thin - shell wormholes in the presence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant . as in @xcite",
    "we shall consider linearized radial perturbations around a static wormhole solution , which is complementary to the analysis discussed by kim @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method resides mainly in the fact that one defines a parametrization of the stability of equilibrium @xcite , as not to specify an equation of state on the boundary surface .",
