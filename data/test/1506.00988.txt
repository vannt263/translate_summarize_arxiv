    "recently , an exploration of the vacuum solutions of pure @xmath0 gravity uncovered new black hole solutions , resulting , in part , from the lack of a generalized birkhoff theorem @xcite .",
    "as a theory , quadratic gravity has several intriguing features : it possesses scale invariance and with the addition of the weyl curvature tensor @xmath3 , is renormalizable @xcite . numerically it has been shown that the most general quadratic gravitational action , @xmath4 for some constant @xmath5 , also admits new black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "pure @xmath0 gravity is the only pure quadratic gravity that is ghost free @xcite and , as an example of an @xmath1 theory , is sometimes dual to the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity ( gr ) minimally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "we briefly review how this duality arises in section  [ sec_review ] and discuss the cases where the duality fails .",
    "it is precisely in this regime , where @xmath2 , that the new black hole solutions of @xcite were found .",
    "the authors interpreted these solutions as a part of the strong coupling limit of gr . in this paper , we show that the vacuum space of @xmath0 gravity permits new traversable wormhole and non - singular black hole solutions .",
    "we emphasize that these structures are supported only by the vacuum and do not require any unusual states of matter . in einstein",
    "s theory of general relativity , every metric @xmath6 , is a solution to einstein s equations for some associated stress energy tensor @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore a challenging task to determine which solutions should be considered physical solutions .",
    "this dilemma lead to the development of _ ad hoc energy conditions intended to reasonably restrict properties of the sourcing matter .",
    "the weakest such condition , the null energy condition ( nec ) , stipulates that the stress energy tensor of matter should satisfy @xmath8 for any arbitrary null vector @xmath9 .",
    "imposing such conditions prohibits the construction of many spacetimes in the context of gr , including traversable wormholes @xcite .",
    "wormholes have appeared in many science fiction settings , recently giving rise to additional research on the subject @xcite . besides a means of rapid interstellar travel used by advanced civilizations ,",
    "wormholes are discussed in the quest to understand the relation between entanglement and the possible emergence of spacetime @xcite .",
    "such ideas were applied to the information paradox , yielding the so called , @xmath10 conjecture @xcite , which suggests that entangled particles are connected via a ( non - traversable ) einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "likewise , it has long been speculated that quantum gravity may somehow resolve singularities in black hole spacetimes leading some researchers to the idea that the universe itself , might have been created on the interior of a black hole ( for some early work see @xcite ) . _    in section  [ sec_review ] we discuss how the new spacetime solutions are possible and present our solutions in section  [ sec : sol ] .",
    "we then show explicitly in section  [ sec_geoobs ] that observers and light rays can traverse the throat of the wormhole and discuss some of the trajectory s properties in section  [ sec_div ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the appearance of the wormhole to asymptotic observers in section  [ sec_asymptoticsol ] .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity action is a specific example of the more general @xmath1 action @xcite , [ fraction ] s = d^4x f(r)+s_m . when the matter action @xmath11 exhibits conformal symmetry and @xmath12 is non - vanishing , it is well known that this action is equivalent to einstein gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "this is shown by writing the action in terms of the metric @xmath13 , where the conformal factor is given by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , any solutions found in such @xmath1 theories will also be found in einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , this is not necessarily the case when @xmath15 vanishes , and the metric @xmath16 , is ill defined .",
    "wormhole solutions in @xmath1 have been studied extensively  @xcite .    in @xmath1 gravity",
    "the metric @xmath17 has equation of motion , @xmath18 in the above , @xmath7 is the stress - energy tensor of any external matter present . ,",
    "metric signature @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . ] focusing on vacuum solutions , @xmath21 , we notice that any metric producing @xmath22 will be a solution of this theory .",
    "these conditions may constraint @xmath23 but leave significant freedom in the form of the ricci tensor @xmath24 .",
    "focusing on the simplest case which satisfies the above criteria , @xmath25 , we find that every spacetime with traceless ricci tensor is a solution to the @xmath0 gravity eom .",
    "this abundant freedom in the form of @xmath24 is how birkhoff s theorem is circumvented . in standard einstein gravity",
    ", @xmath2 implies @xmath26 and therefore any metric sourced by matter with traceless energy - momentum tensor will also be a solution to the vacuum of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "one notable example is the electromagnetic field with @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that this new freedom found in the vacuum of @xmath0 gravity allows bundles of ingoing modes to evolve from converging to diverging modes in section [ sec_div ] . in ordinary einstein gravity ,",
    "such evolution would only be possible through a violation of the nec as can be shown through the raychaudhuri equation  an equation which describes the evolution of the bundle s divergence @xmath28 . for null geodesics with tangent null vector @xmath9 ,",
    "the raychaudhuri equation is = -^2 -_^+_^-r_k^k^. here @xmath29 is the shear tensor and @xmath30 the vorticity tensor .",
    "the vorticity can always be set to zero by choosing a coordinate system in which the congruences are hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "the remaining terms on the rhs are all negative in gr if the nec is satisfied ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath32 and hence bundles of null geodesics are always converging . in @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "vacuum solutions can have @xmath33 so that the above conclusion need not apply .",
    "the most general static and spherically symmetric spacetime is given by ds^2=-f_1(r)dt^2+f_2(r)dr^2+r^2d^2 , where @xmath34 .",
    "we make the following metric ansatz f_1(r)=g(r)f_2(r)=. introducing a reparametrization of the radial coordinate , @xmath35 , for some constant @xmath36 , the metric becomes , [ ansatz ] s^2=-g(l)t^2+l^2+(l^2+k^2)^2 .",
    "if @xmath37 as @xmath38 , this metric connects two asymptotically minkowski spacetimes .",
    "the constant @xmath36 will set the minimal wormhole throat radius as @xmath39 can not become smaller than this value .",
    "the ricci scalar of this spacetime is given ( in terms of @xmath40 ) by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "requiring @xmath2 , yields a two parameter solution for @xmath40 .",
    "a complicated exact solution of this second order ode is given in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "for our purposes we need only discuss certain limiting behaviors . taking the large @xmath43 limit of eq.([ricciscalar ] ) ,",
    "corresponding to large @xmath39 , and solving the @xmath2 ode , we find the asymptotic solution , [ largel ] g(l)1-+ .",
    "this resembles a reissnernordstrm metric of mass @xmath44 and charge @xmath45 .",
    "these need not be the same for the two different asymptotic regions . hence we label them by a @xmath46 to denote the values measured by observers located at @xmath47 .",
    "note that these parameters arises as integration constants and should not be associated with a conserved  mass \" and  charge \" even though we denote them by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for example , the approximate solution in equation ( [ largel ] ) drops a non - analytic term , seen only in the large @xmath43 limit of the exact solution , that goes as @xmath50 .",
    "hence @xmath51 , taken as the coefficient of the @xmath52 term in the series expansion , can not be a well defined finite charge .",
    "we will discuss this point further in section [ sec_asymptoticsol ] .    at small @xmath43 ,",
    "the solution is approximately , [ smalll ] g(l0 ) where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the initial conditions determining the shape of the throat .",
    "the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expressed in terms of these parameters in section [ sec_asymptoticsol ] . given appropriate choices of @xmath57 , we ensure that @xmath40 is strictly positive for all @xmath43 .",
    "the solutions are shown in figure ( [ worm1 ] ) . in these cases",
    "the spacetime has no horizons even though it appears as a black hole to asymptotic observers .    for certain initial conditions our solutions can develop horizons",
    ", however the solutions remain free of singularities . to the asymptotic observer",
    "these solutions appear as non - singular black holes ( or one - way traversable wormholes ) .",
    "in general there can be up to two regions where the @xmath58 slices become spacelike , whenever @xmath40 becomes negative .",
    "this can be seen by noting that for @xmath59 the ode is similar to an overdamped oscillator with equilibrium at @xmath60 and therefore any zero crossings must occur in the range @xmath61 $ ] . as @xmath62 changes in @xmath40",
    "occur on a length scale @xmath63 , we expect @xmath40 to oscillate at most once during this interval , possibly below zero , and then it will asymptote monotonically to its equilibrium value .",
    "this may occur on either side of the @xmath64 point and there are at most two regions where @xmath40 is negative .",
    "penrose diagrams show the causal structures of the three spacetimes discussed above in figure [ horizons ] . in the remainder of this work we focus on the cases with no horizons , where @xmath40 remains",
    "well behaved so that the @xmath65 coordinate system covers the entire spacetime manifold . in other words",

    "here we compute the paths of null and timelike geodesics traveling in the radial direction ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we show that a timelike observer can , in principle , safely traverse the wormhole .",
    "we begin with a discussion of null geodesic which have @xmath74 and are therefore parametrized by , = g.    assuming no horizons , this may be integrated to find the path @xmath75 of radially propagating photons . in section [ sec_div ]",
    "we shall see that the affine parameter defined by @xmath76 for some arbitrary constant @xmath77 is a monotonic boundless function of @xmath78 .",
    "hence the light rays trajectory through the throat can be described in a finite range of the affine parameter .",
    "we now turn to timelike geodesics . given a four velocity @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the observer s proper time the geodesic equation reads , u^_u^=0 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath81 for radial trajectories gives the following condition , [ normalization ] ( ) ^2=()^2 + .",
    "eliminating @xmath82 from the @xmath43 component of the geodesic equation , one can solve for @xmath83 through , [ eoml ] l=- , and @xmath84 is determined from eq.([normalization ] ) . to visualize the geodesic motion , we embed the geometry in a higher dimensional space . suppressing the @xmath28 coordinate and taking a time slice at a particular @xmath78 ( which looks the same for any choice of @xmath78 ) ,",
    "we embed the wormhole in a 3d space as shown in figure ( [ wormgeo ] ) .",
    "this particular solution corresponds to a @xmath85 and @xmath86 wormhole .",
    "the red line represents the radial trajectory of a timelike observer .",
    "we also show how different values of @xmath57 ( defined and color coded in the caption of figure ( [ worm1 ] ) ) affect our courageous explorer along his journey .",
    "note that the solutions can have regions where gravity is attractive or repulsive towards @xmath64 .",
    "the transition occurs wherever @xmath87 switches sign .",
    "for instance , our solutions with @xmath85 have repulsive gravitational forces near the throat and incoming observers must possess sufficient velocity to traverse the throat . in figure ( [ ltvspt ] ) , our infalling explorer labelled by the solid green curve does not have sufficient speed and is repelled out of the wormhole . however , the solution with @xmath88 is attractive everywhere towards the wormhole and the observer travelling in this background ( designated by the red dot - dashed line in figure ( [ ltvspt ] ) ) oscillates back and forth through the wormhole .",
    "it is even easy to find solutions where @xmath40 asymptotically relaxes back to @xmath89 from above . in these cases",
    "our asymptotic observers would associate a negative @xmath44 to the wormhole and feel a repulsive force from it !",
    "this might be concerning at first sight as this would imply a spacetime with negative mass in standard gr .",
    "however the situation is more complicated in @xmath0 gravity as we will discuss in section [ sec_asymptoticsol ] .",
    "0.35     0.4",
    "in this section we determine how bundles of geodesics evolve as they pass through the wormhole .",
    "the non - zero components of the ricci tensor read , @xmath90 taking the radial geodesics with affine parameter @xmath91 , @xmath92 for in(- ) and outgoing(+ ) geodesics respectively , we find @xmath93 this is strictly negative and therefore can allow for @xmath94 .",
    "we now compute the divergence explicitly .",
    "the divergence of a bundle of geodesics with tangent vectors @xmath9 is given by @xmath95 .",
    "to determine @xmath96 one must look at the geodesic equation for the null ray .",
    "the @xmath97 equation is , @xmath98 where in the second line we assumed @xmath99 , appropriate for a time independent metric .",
    "this is solved by @xmath100 for some integration constant @xmath77 which denotes the arbitrary choice in the affine parameter s normalization .",
    "we take the value @xmath101 . in the cases",
    "were @xmath40 is well behaved so that our coordinate system is valid everywhere , we can compute @xmath28 for any @xmath43 , = ( ) .",
    "the @xmath46 corresponds to in and outgoing modes respectively . as expected , @xmath28 switches sign when the light rays cross the throat at @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath28 gives the expansion / contraction of the cross sectional area of a bundle of light rays ( it is an area , as orthogonal hypersurfaces to null geodesics are two dimensional ) , the radial null geodesics of the metric in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) are not affected by the form of @xmath40 .",
    "a timelike observer will also feel increasingly squeezed by the tidal forces as we enters the wormhole . unlike for null geodesics",
    ", such observers will be sensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "morris & thorne @xcite used these tidal forces to impose constraints on the wormhole spacetime by requiring that a human sized observer feels less than a @xmath102 of force .",
    "we avoid imposing any such conditions here but give a brief derivation of the tidal forces below .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for additional details .",
    "consider an observer @xmath103 at rest with respect to @xmath104 , and proper reference frame with basis vectors , @xmath105 in this coordinate system the metric takes the simple form @xmath106 .",
    "a second observer @xmath107 located at the same point , but moving with a speed @xmath108 in the radial direction , will also have his own reference frame whose basis can be written in terms of the coordinates of @xmath103 through a lorentz boost , leaving @xmath109 unchanged , @xmath110 here the gamma factor is the usual @xmath111 . in this frame",
    "the moving observer has four velocity @xmath112 .",
    "since the four acceleration is perpendicular to the four velocity , our radially moving observer s acceleration will only have a non zero radial component in his own reference frame , namely @xmath113 .",
    "to find @xmath114 is to write @xmath115 in the @xmath65 coordinates which have constant vielbeins and use , @xmath116 here , @xmath117 , and , [ acceleration ] a=- . at @xmath38 and assuming @xmath118 , the acceleration felt is @xmath119 . for @xmath120 , the term @xmath87 contains terms evolving as @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "hence one may tune these values so that the observer crossing the throat will feel a desired acceleration .    the tidal acceleration felt by the observer @xmath107",
    "can also be computed in his reference frame .",
    "the relative acceleration of two nearby points separated by @xmath123 as measured by @xmath107 is given by , a^=-r^_u^^u^=- r_^ , with , @xmath124 we can explicitly see how the size of the throat @xmath36 influences the strength at which our traveler is squeezed in the angular directions .",
    "from figure ( [ worm1 ] ) we see that there is a lack of parity symmetry in the @xmath43 component when @xmath125 .",
    "as previously mentioned , this causes observers in different asymptotic regions to see different looking wormholes , characterized by @xmath55 and @xmath56 seen at @xmath126 .",
    "these are determined by @xmath57 from expanding the exact solution of @xmath40 and picking out the asymptotic coefficients .",
    "defining @xmath127 , we expand the solution of @xmath40 around @xmath128 and define ,    @xmath129    one finds that , = -2 + ( /2 ) g_0kv_0 with @xmath130 being a number whose exact expression is given in appendix ( [ appa ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath40 is to approach one from below in the @xmath131 limit , then the sign of @xmath132 will be negative but this is just because our `` radial '' coordinate @xmath43 takes on negative values .",
    "the @xmath46 sign in front of @xmath122 is responsible for the asymmetry .",
    "even though this implies that asymptotic observers will feel different accelerations toward the wormhole , one can not gain energy by going from one region to the other .",
    "the asymmetrical shape of the throat ( as is seen by the solid green curve in fig.[worm1 ] ) will prohibit this as can be shown by eq.([eoml ] ) which implies @xmath133 is a conserved quantity and so @xmath134_{l=\\pm\\infty}=0 $ ] .",
    "meanwhile the coefficient @xmath51 is found to be , =( /2)g_0- ( /2)kv_0 - 2(u ) .",
    "the very last term has a logarithmic dependence so that , not only is @xmath51 not a constant , it diverges as @xmath135 .",
    "this shows that the exact solution and the reissnernordstrm spacetime differs radically in the asymptotic region . in the case of gr with electromagnetism",
    ", the conserved charge is defined by the conserved current @xmath136 integrated over a spacelike hypersurface . here",
    "no such analogue electromagnetic field is present .",
    "the logarithm found is just a feature of our particular wormhole solution . choosing a different ansatz , such as simply replacing the angular part of eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) by , g_^2=(l^2+)^2 , allows us to obtain wormhole solutions that asymptotically approach reissnernordstrm metrics without logarithmic contribution .",
    "conserved charges are tightly linked with symmetries of the theory . in our case , we have a timelike killing vector @xmath137 with which we can construct a conserved current and find the corresponding charge ; however , the interpretation of charges in @xmath0 gravity is tricky .",
    "previous attempts @xcite by deser & tekin , to define an energy for higher curvature gravity in analogy with gr have shown that every asymptotically flat solution of @xmath0 gravity has vanishing energy .",
    "an alternative definition was proposed by the same authors and relied instead on the corresponding poisson equation of higher curvature gravity @xcite . in terms of this second definition ,",
    "the leading term of the source in the poisson equation defines the energy and allows for a less degenerate classification of spacetimes but still yields a vanishing energy for solutions with everywhere vanishing ricci scalar .",
    "therefore even though an asymptotic observer will feel that the wormhole is exerting a gravitational force ( just as if it were a spherical object of mass @xmath55 in ordinary gr ) he should nt associate this value with a conserved charge such as the energy .",
    "hence one might wonder if these quantities can evolve upon the introduction of small perturbations .",
    "in this paper we have presented new static wormhole and ( non - singular ) black hole solutions found in the vacuum of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the traversable wormholes are are solutions in @xmath138 which do not require the support of any nec violating exotic matter",
    ". their existence could prove important as it is argued in @xcite that the new @xmath2 solutions might be part of the strong coupling limit ( @xmath139 ) of general relativity .",
    "it would be interesting to study the role of such spacetimes in this limit using other tools .",
    "for instance it was shown recently that in the context of ads / cft , the strong subadditivity condition of entanglement entropy imposes constraints on the bulk geometry of certain spacetimes @xcite .",
    "one would require a dual cft to asymptotically @xmath2 solutions to apply similar results .    in the context of our particular solution",
    ", we have shown that asymptotic observers view the wormhole as a black hole with  mass \" @xmath55 and varying  charge \" @xmath56 .",
    "we have stressed that one should not be associating these values as conserved charge .",
    "they are taken as coefficients of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 terms in the metric expansion and do not correspond to some conserved quantity as was the case in gr .",
    "this raises the question of whether @xmath55 and @xmath56 , along with the whole wormhole itself , are dynamical once small perturbations are introduced .",
    "it would also be interesting to look for further exotic solutions to general @xmath1 theories which can not be captured by einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field .",
