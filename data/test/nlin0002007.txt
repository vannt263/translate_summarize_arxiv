    "traffic phenomena attract much attention of physicists in recent years .",
    "it shows a complex phase transition from free to congested state , and many theoretical models have been proposed so far@xcite@xcite . among them",
    "we will focus on deterministic cellular automaton ( ca ) models .",
    "ca models are simple , flexible , and suitable for computer simulations of discrete phenomena .",
    "the rule184 ca@xcite has been widely used as a prototype of deterministic model of traffic flow . in the model ,",
    "lane is single and cars can move by one site at most every time step .",
    "its several variations have been proposed recently : first , fukui and ishibashi ( fi ) proposed a high speed extension@xcite of the rule184 ca . in the model",
    ", cars can move more than one site per unit time if there are successive vacant spaces ahead .",
    "second , fuk and boccara proposed a ` monitored traffic model'@xcite , which is a kind of quick start ( qs ) model . in the model",
    ", drivers can prospect vacant spaces due to car motion in the next site and can move more quickly compared with the rule184 ca .",
    "third , takayasu and takayasu proposed a slow start ( sls ) model@xcite , in which cars can not move just after they stop and wait for a unit time .",
    "this represents an asymmetry of stopping and starting behavior .",
    "we call all these variants a family of rule184 ca in this paper .    a desirable condition for ca as",
    "a traffic model is that it can show a phase transition observed in real data .",
    "let us see an example of real data of tomei expressway taken by the japan highway public corporation@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows flow ",
    "density diagrams often called ` fundamental diagram ' , of both lanes in january 1996 on up line at 170.64 km point from tokyo .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are diagrams of driving and acceleration lane respectively .",
    "we see that a phase transition from free to congested state around a density of 25 vehicles@xmath0 km in both lanes , and there is a clearer discontinuity in the acceleration lane .",
    "the multiple states of flow at the same density around the critical density are also observed particularly in the acceleration lane , and a skeleton curve of plot points shows a shape of ` inverse @xmath1 ' .",
    "these phenomena are often observed in real data@xcite .",
    "there is another observed fact that over a certain critical density , a perturbation to a uniform traffic causes a formation of jam , and ` stop - and - go ' wave propagates backward@xcite .",
    "cars accelerate and decelerate alternately in the wave .",
    "we adopt these two experimental facts , multiple states and stop - and - go wave , as criteria to judge whether a ca is suitable for traffic model or not . among the rule184",
    "ca family , only sls model shows multiple states and also shows a stop - and - go wave .",
    "recently , a multi - value generalization of the rule184 ca has been proposed by using an ultradiscrete method@xcite .",
    "its evolution equation is @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the number of cars at site @xmath4 and time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is an integer constant .",
    "each site is assumed to hold @xmath6 cars at most .",
    "we can prove that if @xmath7 and @xmath8 for any @xmath4 , then @xmath9 holds for any @xmath4 . thus ( [ bca ] ) is considered to be @xmath10value ca . since ( [ bca ] ) is obtained from an ultradiscretization of the burgers equation , we call it burgers ca ( bca)@xcite . note that bca is equivalent to the rule184 ca in a special case of @xmath11 .",
    "the positive integer @xmath6 can be interpreted physically in the following three ways : first , the road is an @xmath6lane freeway in a coarse sense , and effect of lane - changing rule is not expressed explicitly . in appendix , we show bca with @xmath12 can be interpreted as a two lane model of the rule184 ca with an explicit lane ",
    "changing rule .",
    "second , @xmath13 represents a probability distribution of cars in a single - lane freeway . in this case , @xmath14 itself no longer represents a real number of cars at site @xmath4 .",
    "third , also in a single - lane freeway , length of each site is assumed to be long enough to contain @xmath6 cars . by introducing the free parameter @xmath6 into the rule184 ca family",
    ", we can generalize them to multi - value ca and obtain rich algebraic properties and wide applications to various transport phenomena .",
    "though bca does not show multiple states at a density in the fundamental diagram , we have shown that its high speed extension shows multiple states around a critical density@xcite .",
    "metastable states of flow in the model exist on a prominent part of a line in a free phase over a critical density .",
    "the model is also considered to be a multi - value generalization of fi model .",
    "this model is mentioned in sec.[sec : ebca2 ] to compare other models .",
    "other models in the rule184 ca family , sls model and qs model , are two - value ca like fi model .",
    "we generalize them to multi - value ones and investigate their properties as a traffic model in detail .",
    "we use a max  plus representation to express time evolution rule of those generalized models .",
    "this representation comes from the ultradiscrete method which has a close relation with the max  plus",
    "algebra@xcite , as shown in our previous papers . using max ",
    "plus representation , we can express evolution rule of the above ca s in a conservation from like ( [ bca ] ) , which automatically derives a conservation of total number of cars .",
    "in this section , we will present four ca models which are multi - value generalization of the rule184 ca family . before explaining models , we shortly review a rule of car movement of bca . note that we assume @xmath6 is a lane number of the road in the description of all models . in bca ,",
    "cars at site @xmath4 move to vacant spaces at their next site @xmath15 as many as possible .",
    "therefore , car flow from @xmath4 to @xmath15 at time @xmath5 becomes @xmath16 .",
    "thus adding @xmath17 ( flow from @xmath18 to @xmath4 ) and @xmath19 ( flow from @xmath4 to @xmath15 ) to @xmath14 ( present car number ) , we obtain @xmath20 and derive ( [ bca ] ) .",
    "first , we generalize qs model to a multi - value one . in the multi - value model ,",
    "cars at site @xmath4 move to vacant spaces at site @xmath15 per unit time as many as possible .",
    "this movement rule is similar to that of bca .",
    "however , a difference is that drivers at @xmath4 estimate vacant spaces at @xmath15 by predicting how many cars move from @xmath15 to @xmath21 .",
    "thus , they estimate vacant spaces at @xmath15 at time @xmath5 to be @xmath22 . therefore considering the number of cars coming into and escaping from site @xmath4 , evolution equation on @xmath14",
    "is given by @xmath23 the final form of ( [ spsca ] ) means that the number of movable cars ( @xmath14 ) is limited by vacant spaces ( @xmath24 ) in their next two sites . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "this model is identical to qs model proposed by fuk and boccara , and it is the rule3212885888 ca of a neighborhood size ` 5 ' after wolfram s terminology@xcite .      in the original sls model ,",
    "lane is single and cars can not move just after they stop and wait for a unit time .",
    "movable cars move to vacant spaces in their next site like bca . in the multi - value case , we should distinguish standing cars and moving cars in each site because each site can hold plural cars .",
    "the number of cars at site @xmath4 blocked by cars at @xmath15 at time @xmath25 is represented by @xmath26 .",
    "these cars can not move at @xmath5 , then the maximum number of cars movable to site @xmath4 at @xmath5 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the multi - value sls ca is given by @xmath28\\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\min\\left[u^t_{j } - \\{u^{t-1}_{j } - \\min ( u^{t-1}_{j } , l - u^{t-1}_{j+1})\\ } ,                l - u^t_{j+1 } ) \\right ] \\label{sls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that this model includes the original sls model in the case @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath29 is determined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the evolution equation is second order in time and an effect of inertia of cars is included in this model .      in our previous paper@xcite",
    ", we propose an extended bca ( ebca ) model in which cars can move two site forward at a unit time if the successive two sites are not fully occupied . in this paper , we call the model ` ebca2 ' and another model with a similar extension ` ebca1 ' described in the next subsection .",
    "a main difference between two models is a priority of movement of fast and slow cars to vacant spaces .",
    "fast cars with speed 2 move prior to slow ones with speed 1 in ebca2 and otherwise in ebca1 .",
    "evolution equation of ebca2 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 which is the number of cars moving by two sites and @xmath34 .",
    "in reference @xcite , we only study the cases of @xmath11 and 2 . in this paper",
    ", we show some properties of flow for @xmath6 in the next section .",
    "note that ( [ ebca2 ] ) in the case of @xmath11 is fi model which is equivalent to the rule3436170432 ca .",
    "there is another possibility when we extend bca to a high - speed model and we call this extended new model ebca1 .",
    "in contrast to ebca2 , slow cars with speed 1 move prior to fast ones with speed 2 . then car movement from @xmath5 to @xmath35",
    "consists of the following two successive procedures ,    * cars move to vacant spaces in their next site as many as possible .",
    "* only cars moved in procedure a ) can move more one site and they move to their next vacant spaces as many as possible .",
    "the number of moving cars at site @xmath4 and time @xmath5 in procedure a ) is given by @xmath34 .",
    "in procedure b ) , the number of moving cars at site @xmath15 becomes @xmath36 , where the second term in @xmath37 represents vacant spaces at site @xmath21 after the first procedure a ) .",
    "therefore , considering a total number of cars entering into and escaping from site @xmath4 , evolution equation of ebca1 is given by @xmath38 note that ( [ ebca1 ] ) with @xmath11 differs from fi model and it is equivalent to rule3372206272 ca .",
    "we can consider that this rule is an extension of sls model to high - speed motion since cars which stop at procedure a ) can not move at procedure b ) .",
    "let us consider a relation between sls and ebca1 models in detail .",
    "if we write each procedure of ebca1 explicitly using an intermediate time step , we obtain @xmath39 equations ( [ ebca1eq1 ] ) and ( [ ebca1eq2 ] ) represent above procedure a ) and b ) respectively , and @xmath40 denotes car number at site @xmath4 just after procedure a ) . if we replace @xmath35 by @xmath41 in ( [ bca",
    "] ) , we obtain ( [ ebca1eq1 ] ) . moreover , if we replace @xmath5 by @xmath41 and @xmath25 by @xmath5 in ( [ sls ] ) , we obtain ( [ ebca1eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we can consider ebca1 to be a ` combination ' of bca and sls rules .",
    "we discuss fundamental diagrams of new ca models described in the previous section . in the followings , we will consider a periodic road or a circuit .",
    "all models in sec.[sec : gmca ] can be expressed in a conservation form such as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are forward difference operator with respect to indicated variable , and @xmath45 represents a traffic flow .",
    "average density @xmath46 and average flow @xmath47 over all sites are defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is number of sites in a period .",
    "since all models are in a conservation form , average density does not depend on time and we can use @xmath46 without a script @xmath5",
    ".    figures [ fig2 ] ( a)(d ) are density  flow diagrams of previous models with @xmath12 and @xmath50 .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] ( a)(d ) corresponds to multi - value qs , multi - value sls , ebca2 and ebca1 models respectively . if we set a number @xmath51 of cars , we obtain a unique density @xmath52 but there are many initial distributions of cars .",
    "each initial distribution does not always reach a steady flow and often make a periodic state .",
    "@xmath47 can also changes periodically in time .",
    "therefore , we plot every points in figures by averaging @xmath47 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "( we use @xmath55 as an average flow . ) note that @xmath53 is long enough from initial time to obtain a periodic state and @xmath56 time steps is much longer than its period .",
    "moreover , we obtain different values of @xmath55 from different initial distributions for a given @xmath46 in figs.[fig4 ] ( b ) @xmath57 ( d ) . in ref.@xcite , this type of state giving different @xmath55 values for the same density are called ` multiple states'@xcite .",
    "we use this terminology for other models in this paper .",
    "multiple states exist around a critical density . especially for multi - value sls model ( fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) ) and ebca1 model ( fig.[fig2 ] ( d ) )",
    ", we see a thick branch other than lines forming an inverse @xmath1 shape and the distribution of data in the branch look random .",
    "this fact is interesting because evolution rules are completely deterministic .",
    "next , we focus on ebca1 model and examine its properties in detail .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] is a skeleton diagram of ebca1 model .",
    "branches in fig.[fig3 ] are drawn as straight lines and we obtain them using specific initial conditions . for example , states ` @xmath58 ' , ` @xmath59 ' , ` @xmath60 ' and ` @xmath61 ' are all steady states in the model , and flows of these states are plotted on b , c , d and e respectively in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "there are two branches in congested phase of higher density , that is , b ",
    "c and d  e .",
    "we call the branch d  e and b  c congested phase zero and phase one respectively .",
    "it is noted that there are many states not on the skeleton in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "for example , state @xmath62 is a steady state of the model , and it has density 2/3 and flow 1/2 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows a time evolution of flow @xmath47 in ebca1 model with a density of phase transition region .",
    "number of total sites @xmath49 is 60 and 240 in fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively . in the figures",
    ", we can see periodic oscillation of flow appearing soon after an initial time .",
    "we observe that the maximum period of oscillation becomes longer as system size becomes larger .",
    "moreover , oscillation in a period is not simple as shown in the figures .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] ( c ) shows a power spectrum @xmath63 versus frequency @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 .",
    "we set @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this indicates that the irregular oscillation is similar to white noise .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] is a fundamental diagram of ebca1 with @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting that there exist multiple states even in the case @xmath11 , which is equivalent to the rule3372206272 ca . among deterministic two - value ca models ,",
    "only sls model is known to show metastable state so far .",
    "thus , ebca1 with @xmath11 becomes the second example of such kind of two - value ca .    at the end of this section",
    ", we give a comment on a case of @xmath68 .",
    "fundamental diagram of multi - value qs model is the same regardless of @xmath6 . in other models ,",
    "small branches increases around the critical density as @xmath6 becomes larger .",
    "let us show this phenomenon using ebca2 which has clear branches .",
    "the fundamental diagram of ebca2 with @xmath69 is given in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "there are many branches around the critical density",
    ". we can give a partial explanation of these branches .",
    "let us assume initial values on all sites are restricted to @xmath70 or @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "then , if we use a transformation @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 and @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "we can easily show that evolution equation on @xmath75 is obtained by replacing @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath6 by 1 in ( [ ebca2 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ebca2 ] ) with @xmath11 is fi model itself and it is two - value ca .",
    "therefore , if all initial values of @xmath74 is restricted to @xmath70 or @xmath71 , then @xmath74 at any site is always @xmath70 or @xmath71 and evolutional state is the same as that of fi model by replacing 0 by @xmath70 and 1 by @xmath71 .",
    "above fact implies a shape of the fundamental diagram .",
    "consider an arbitrary state of fi model , that is , ( [ ebca2 ] ) with @xmath11 .",
    "let us assume density is @xmath46 and average flow is @xmath55 for that state .",
    "we can obtain a corresponding state of ( [ ebca2 ] ) with @xmath7 by replacing 0 by @xmath70 and 1 by @xmath71 .",
    "then , using ( [ ebca2 ] ) , we can easily show that density of that state is @xmath80 and flow is @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , we can also show that a fundamental diagram of fi model is exactly given by two segments of which end points are @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 respectively .",
    "therefore , a diagram of ebca2 with @xmath7 has at least a segment with end points @xmath86 and @xmath87 and that with @xmath88 and @xmath89 for any @xmath70 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] is a @xmath69 case and the shape of diagram is strictly a superposition of all these segments .",
    "in this section , we investigate stability of the branches in fundamental diagram obtained in the previous section .",
    "first , we study a uniform state @xmath91 , which gives the maximum flow in each model .",
    "let us define a weak perturbation by a perturbation changing a local state @xmath92 to @xmath93 , and a strong perturbation by a perturbation changing @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "both perturbations clearly do not change the density .",
    "these perturbations mean that a car or two cars in the uniform flow suddenly decrease their speed and consequently fully - occupied sites ` 2 ' appear .",
    "figures [ fig7 ] ( a)(c ) show an instability of uniform flow by a weak perturbation in multi - value sls , ebca2 and ebca1 models respectively .",
    "we can observe a stop - and - go wave propagating backward from the perturbed site in fig.[fig7 ] ( a ) ( multi - value sls ) and ( c ) ( ebca1 ) , while the wave does not appear in ( b ) ( ebca2 ) . in fig.[fig7 ] ( c ) , flow @xmath55 decreases by the weak perturbation and transits from a to f in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "moreover , we see that the final steady state contains locally two states corresponding to b and c in fig.[fig3 ] . flow of state b is 5/6 and that of c is 1/2 , both states are in the phase one , and they give the maximum and minimum flow in that phase . numerical results from various initial states with a weak perturbation shows that a state of higher density tends to give this type of extreme local states on a branch after some time steps .",
    "moreover , if we give a strong perturbation of uniform state @xmath96 corresponding to a , it goes down directly to g(1/2,1/2 ) in the phase zero .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] ( d ) shows an instability due to a strong perturbation in ebca1 model . in this case , stop - and - go wave does not occur .",
    "moreover , we see that the final state consists of two local states @xmath97 and @xmath61 corresponding to d and e in fig.[fig3 ] , which also give the maximum and minimum flow in the phase zero respectively .    since a perturbed uniform state becomes a congested one which consists of states giving the maximum and the minimum flow in a phase , we can predict a length of the final congested bunch .",
    "assume @xmath98 denotes a ratio of length of final congested bunch to length of total sites .",
    "density of b , f and c are 5/12 , 1/2 and 3/4 respectively .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath99 and @xmath98 becomes @xmath100 which coincides with that of fig.[fig7 ] ( c ) . in the case of the phase zero , we also obtain @xmath101(fig.[fig7](d ) ) .",
    "contrary to above facts , there also exist some states on branches stable against a weak perturbation .",
    "let us consider states on branch a  d in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "there exists a state @xmath102 on the branch and we obtain @xmath103 by a weak perturbation . against the perturbation ,",
    "perturbed state is stable and it is still on the branch a ",
    "we call this type of state metastable state",
    ". moreover , let us consider a state @xmath104 corresponding to f in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we can obtain @xmath105 by a weak perturbation , and its flow does not change .",
    "therefore , metastable states exist not only on branch a  d but also on the phase one branch . in these cases , the effect of the site `` 2 '' does not spread over the entire system during the time evolution .",
    "thus some part of the multiple branches are metastable states , which can be observed in long time simulations starting from random initial conditions .",
    "in this paper , some multi - value generalizations of rule184 family are studied by using max  plus representation .",
    "we obtain evolution equations in a conserved form giving @xmath10-value ca .",
    "we have proved that ebca1 model is a generalization of sls model , and it gives multiple states and stop - and - go waves .",
    "we consider that a suitable traffic model gives those two phenomena at least .",
    "if we observe a real traffic data like fig.[fig1 ] , existence of multiple states is clear . in a real traffic ,",
    "cars are considered to be always perturbed by some traffic effects .",
    "therefore , we consider existence of stable branches against a weak perturbation is also desirable for a model . moreover , stop - and - go waves are often observed in a real congested traffic .",
    "considering these points , ebca1 is the most suitable model among the models of this paper .",
    "next , we give a presumption on a fundamental diagram of real data . in fig.[fig1 ] , we see the multiple state clearly in an acceleration lane . in a driving lane",
    ", since the average speed of cars is slower than the acceleration lane , flow tends to be stable and the branch is not clear . in the acceleration lane , drivers move faster than cars in the driving lane , then over - dense free flow will be likely to occur and we can see the multiple state around a critical density in the diagram .",
    "moreover , from the stability analysis we find that there are metastable states even in the congested state in the ebca1 model .",
    "although we can not clearly see the fact due to fluctuation of data in fig.1 , we expect that there exists both a metastable `` weak jam''(line b  c ) and a `` strong jam''(line d  e ) in a real highway traffic .",
    "finally , we point out future problems . we have investigated mainly about models with @xmath12 . about multiple branches due to larger @xmath6 ,",
    "only ebca2 gives clear branches and we can easily discuss their stability .",
    "though other models can also make multiple branches , transformation of perturbed states is complicated and its analysis is difficult .",
    "we should solve this difficulty because we consider ebca1 model is more suitable for a traffic model .",
    "moreover , two - dimensional extension of these models and its application to a real traffic network is one of the important future problems .",
