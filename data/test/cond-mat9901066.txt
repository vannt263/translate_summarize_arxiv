    "in the present paper we study the thermodynamical properties of a confined system of spin - polarized fermions in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the method used is an extension of the combination of the path integral formalism @xcite and the method of symmetrized density matrices @xcite , developed previously @xcite for a model system of harmonically interacting identical particles ( bosons or fermions ) in a parabolic well ( hereafter for brevity referred to as the harmonic model ) .    because of the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation @xcite and the theoretical work on this phenomenon employing other methods @xcite , full details for this harmonic model with interaction",
    "were first worked out for bosons .",
    "the model shows the onset of bose - einstein condensation in the specific heat @xcite for a finite number of particles , and its moment of inertia is drastically reduced below the condensation temperature @xcite .",
    "an application of the method to real systems can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 .",
    "the actual calculations for the fermion case require more advanced techniques , such as the generating function approach and the corresponding contour integration , because of a numerical sign problem . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", explicit results for the thermodynamics and the static correlation functions of the harmonic model of spin - polarized fermions were already obtained with these techniques @xcite .",
    "the harmonic model clearly has intrinsic value on its own , because it is one of the rare examples of an exactly soluble many - particle system with interaction .",
    "the physics of the model is relatively straightforward in the sense that it allows for center of mass excitations that oscillate at frequencies different from those of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this property makes it well suited as a trial model for the variational treatment of the thermodynamics of systems with more realistic interactions because the model parameters can be related with the system characteristics with the aid of the jensen - feynman inequality @xcite .",
    "the present paper adresses only the first part of such an approach because it requires also the density and the pair correlation function which we could obtain under the simplifying assumptions of no magnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it provides a testing ground for new approaches to monte carlo simulations of interacting fermions such as many body diffusion @xcite . especially for quantum dots ,",
    "it is important to take the magnetic field into account in order to freeze out the opposite spin states . in the present paper we present an extension of the methods mentioned above to harmonically interacting confined fermions in a magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the path integral for harmonically interacting particles in a parabolic confinement potential in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this will be done for distinguishable as well as for identical particles .",
    "the mathematical details of the calculation for identical particles are given in appendix a. in sec .",
    "iii the permutation symmetry will be taken into account with the aid of the projection technique .",
    "the introduction of the permutation symmetry implies the rewriting of the sum over all possible permutations to a cyclic summation @xcite which leads to the generating function of the partition function .",
    "specific results for fermions will be presented in sec .",
    "this involves the extraction of the partition function and other thermodynamical quantities from the generating function .",
    "also the ground state energy and the magnetic susceptibility in the zero - temperature limit will be investigated .",
    "additionally we will study the finite number corrections to the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and the internal energy as a function of temperature and magnetic field . in the last section",
    "some conclusions are given .",
    "the calculation of the path integral for @xmath0 identical interacting oscillators in a magnetic field is similar to the case without a magnetic field in @xcite .",
    "this approach crucially relies on the detailed investigation of the classical action , and the path - integral corrections to this classical action .",
    "alternatively , a more stochastic approach could be followed @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian ( in atomic units ) for @xmath0 oscillators with harmonic two - body interactions and in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath4 it is obvious that the two - body potential is either attractive or repulsive depending on the plus sign or the minus sign considered in @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic field introduces a coupling in the plain perpendicular to its direction .",
    "this means that we can separate the lagrangian into two contributions @xmath6 the lagrangian @xmath7 simply describes a harmonic oscillator , whereas @xmath8 contains the magnetic field .",
    "the lagrangian can be rewritten in terms of the center of mass coordinate @xmath9 and the coordinates @xmath10 describing the coordinates of the particles measured from the center of mass @xmath11 from which @xmath12 with @xmath13 for a repulsive two - particle potential the internal frequency @xmath14 has to satisfy the stability condition that the confining potential has to be sufficiently strong to overcome the repulsion between the particles .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the transformation to the center of mass coordinate system diagonalizes neither the lagrangian nor the hamiltonian , because of the subsidiary condition @xmath15    we obtain the propagator for distinguishable ( indicated by a subscript @xmath16 ) particles from the action expressed in the imaginary time variable @xmath17 and it is written as @xmath18 where the vector @xmath19 denotes the @xmath0 dimensional @xmath20 coordinates of the particles , with the notation @xmath21 and similarly for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the propagator for a single oscillator with frequency @xmath24 in a magnetic field is well known @xcite and given by @xmath25 \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\exp \\left\\ { -\\frac{s}{2}\\frac{\\left ( \\left ( x^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( y^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( x^{\\prime } \\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( y^{\\prime } \\right ) ^{2}\\right ) \\cosh \\beta s-2\\left ( x^{\\prime } x^{\\prime \\prime } + y^{\\prime } y^{\\prime \\prime }",

    "the denominator in ( [ propagator ] ) accounts for the fact that the internal degrees of freedom are linearly dependent because of the subsidiary conditions ( [ boundary condition ] ) .",
    "intuitively this factor is quite natural , because the propagator would be the product of one - particle propagators @xcite if the particles were independent .    knowing the propagator for distinguishable particles , the symmetrized density matrix @xmath32 for _ identical _ particles can be obtained through the appropriate symmetric or antisymmetric projection @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the permutation matrix , with @xmath35 for bosons and @xmath36 for fermions . even for this harmonic model , with or without magnetic field ,",
    "the sum over the permutations has to remain rather formal at the level of the propagator .",
    "however , for the partition function @xmath37 analytical progress can be made with this summation as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "first of all , one has to deal with the center - of - mass contribution to the propagator .",
    "afterwards , the summation over all possible permutations will be rewritten as a summation over all possible cycles .",
    "the center of mass is not independent of the positions of the other particles , which complicates the calculation of the trace of the propagator . to deal with the contribution of the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath38 to the propagator",
    ", we introduce the delta function @xmath39 in its fourier representation as in @xcite .",
    "this delta function allows one to formally treat the center - of - mass coordinate as an independent variable . applying this identity to the partition function ,",
    "one ends up with @xmath40 the problem at hand is the rewriting of the summation over the permutations as a sum over all possible cycles @xcite .",
    "this cyclic decomposition requires the solution of the path integral for a driven harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field , which is discussed in appendix a.    a permutation can be decomposed into @xmath41 cycles of length @xmath42 , and the positive integers @xmath41 and @xmath42 have to satisfy the constraint @xmath43 the number @xmath44 of permutations with @xmath45 cycles of length @xmath46,@xmath47 , @xmath41 cycles of length @xmath42,@xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .$ ] furthermore , a cycle of length @xmath42 will be obtained from @xmath50 permutations .",
    "thus , the sign factor @xmath51 can be rewritten as @xmath52 these considerations enable one to rewrite the partition function as @xmath53 ^{m_{\\ell } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 the delta function explicitly indicates that the trace is taken over a cycle of length @xmath42 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath55 factorizes as @xmath56 taking into account the semigroup property of the propagators @xmath57 and @xmath58 , one immediately recognizes in @xmath59 the partition function of a driven harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field , with the driving force @xmath60 the calculation of the propagator and the partition function for a driven harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field , with the lagrangian @xmath61 is illustrated in appendix a. as mentioned above , the hard core of this approach is the evaluation of the classical action , but a fully stochastic method @xcite could as well have been followed .",
    "after tedious algebra one eventually finds for the partition function @xmath62 the remaining integrations over @xmath63 and @xmath38 are gaussian and relatively easy to perform , leading to @xmath64 with @xmath65    the contribution @xmath66 derives from the internal degrees of freedom , treated as independent particles .",
    "it contains the full influence of the statistics of the particles , and leads to the true partition function @xmath67 by multiplication with a simple analytical factor . in practice",
    ", the condition ( [ cyclicondition ] ) complicates the use of the above expression for the partition function for a large number of particles .",
    "however this difficulty can be overcome through the use of the generating function . from the generating function",
    "one can then extract the partition function through an inversion of its defining taylor series .",
    "the generating function technique was used before @xcite to obtain the partition function of a set of harmonically interacting identical oscillators in the absence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", a similar construction can be used . introducing the generating function as @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 by definition ) ,",
    "the partition function for the internal degrees of freedom can be obtained from @xmath70 the generating function itself can be obtained with straightforward algebra @xmath71 with the following notation @xmath72 the cyclic summation can be rewritten in terms of the occupation number representation which directly involves the single particle energy levels : @xmath73 by simply applying the chain rule , the expression ( [ partition - chain rule ] ) for the partition function can be written as a recurrence relation @xmath74 however if the number of particles increases , this recurrence relation becomes numerically unpractical because of a numerical sign problem for fermions and drastically increasing simulation time for bosons . for the remaining part of this paper",
    ", the attention will be focussed on the fermion case .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the fermion model can in essence be determined from the contribution @xmath75 of the internal degrees of freedom . as is clear from ( [ part .",
    "func . in cyclic decomp . ] ) , the center of mass correction only adds a trivial contribution to the free energy .",
    "all the effects of the fermion statistics are collected in @xmath76 we first study the zero temperature limit , in which special attention will be paid to the two dimensional case in the @xmath77-plane , and subsequently the evolution of the free energy and the internal energy as a function of the temperature and of the magnetic field .",
    "the ground state properties of the fermion model crucially depend on the single - particle energy levels @xmath78 .",
    "these levels and their occupation by fermions have been discussed and plotted earlier , e.g. , in ref .",
    "for easier reference , we plot the 20 lowest levels fig . 1 . to guide the eye , the fermi energies @xmath79 corresponding to the fully occupied levels at @xmath80 are indicated by the dashed line .",
    "note that the magnetic field does not substantially influence the magnitude of the fermi energy , which remains of order @xmath81 for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic field immediately lifts the degeneracy , but with increasing magnetic field other degeneracies appear and disappear again at particular values of the magnetic field .",
    "although these degeneracies have little effect on the magnitude of the ground state energy @xmath82 , they have a drastic effect on the magnetic susceptibility , which is proportional to @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the discontinuities in the magnetic susceptibility occur at those values of the magnetic field where the single - particle energies become degenerate .",
    "as mentioned above , the sign problem for fermions can be worked around by inverting the defining taylor - series ( [ taylor - series for the gen . func . ] ) for the generating function . the fowler - darwin method @xcite provides an accurate and elegant way @xcite to realize this inversion : @xmath84",
    "if one considers a circular contour @xmath85 with radius @xmath86 , an optimal value of @xmath86 can be determined by the method of steepest descent @xmath87 using ( [ gen .",
    "func . ] ) , this condition becomes @xmath88 with @xmath89 if @xmath86 would be interpreted as the fugacity @xmath90 with chemical potential @xmath91 , one thus would recover similar results as for the expectation value of the number of particles in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the result for the chemical potential as a function of temperature is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for various values of the magnetic field and for @xmath92 .",
    "the chemical potential is plotted in units of the chemical potential at @xmath93 , and the temperature in units of @xmath94 , which is the order of magnitude for the fermi energy . in fig . 4 and 5",
    "the corresponding results are shown for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath97 it turns out that @xmath98 as a function of @xmath99 becomes almost independent of both the number of particles and of the magnetic field .",
    "however , in the present treatment the determination of @xmath90 from ( [ n ] ) only gives the zero - order contribution to the partition function .",
    "a correction by the integration factor in ( [ contour integral ] ) has to be applied . using the symmetry of the integrand in ( [ contour integral ] )",
    ", the partition function can be rewritten as @xmath100 with @xmath101 .\\ ] ] the function @xmath102 has to be calculated and integrated numerically .",
    "the determination of the free energy @xmath103 then becomes straightforward , with the zero - order contribution @xmath104 from the steepest - descent approximation . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the results are discussed in @xcite . for @xmath105 the free energy per particle in units of the fermi energy",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath106 for 10 fermions in fig . 6 and for 100 fermions in fig .",
    "7 , and compared to the zero - order steepest descent contribution . again , for @xmath97 the finite number corrections upon the thermodynamical limit become negligible for all practical purposes .",
    "the internal energy @xmath107 shows the same universality , as is shown in fig .",
    "8 where the internal energy per particle in units of the fermi energy is plotted versus the temperature in units of the fermi temperature for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "using the path integral approach of symmetrized density matrices for identical particles , the thermodynamical properties were calculated for a three dimensional model of @xmath0 harmonically interacting spin - polarized fermions in a parabolic potential well in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the method used is a generalization of the procedure developed earlier in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "explicit results were obtained for the ground state energy , the free energy and the internal energy for a limited number of particles .",
    "the model can be described as a number of spin polarized identical particles in a parabolic confinement potential interacting through a special many body interaction with the consequence that the center of mass is allowed to move independent from the other degrees of freedom . for an analoguous model other forms of confinement potentials",
    "have been investigated without two body interaction . @xcite    the statistics with a finite number of particles in the confinement potential and the cross over to density dependent expressions known from the thermodynamical limit can be studied in this model : as soon as the number of fermions is sufficiently large ( in the order of @xmath97 ) the results are shown to agree and the finite number corrections become relatively small .",
    "the internal energy turns out to obey a scaling law , similar to the scaling from the continuum approximation for the density of states .",
