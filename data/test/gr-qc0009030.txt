    "general relativity describes very well gravity at the classical level , but a quantum theory of gravity requires the introduction of a more general framework .",
    "one of the most promising candidates is presently string theory .",
    "this theory is believed to change drastically the short - range behavior of classical gravity , but also some of its global properties can be modified , such as black hole thermodynamics .",
    "for example , the study of the solutions of effective low - energy theory has shown that , due to the presence of non - minimal couplings , non - trivial scalar hair can arise @xcite , in contrast with classical general relativity , where no - hair theorems @xcite rule out this possibility .",
    "the effects of string theory on gravitational physics are usually investigated by means of effective field theory actions , obtained through a perturbative expansion in the string tension @xmath0 . at the tree level",
    ", the effective action of the heterotic ( but also other types of ) string contains a coupling of the dilaton with gravity via the term .",
    "the solutions of this model have been extensively studied in the literature , both in a perturbative @xcite and numerical @xcite approach .",
    "it turns out that the model admits solutions with non - trivial dilatonic hair .",
    "the scalar charge is not an independent parameter , but is a function of the mass of the black hole , and is therefore an example of secondary hair @xcite .",
    "also the thermodynamics is different from that of black holes .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the theory predicts a lower bound on the mass of black holes @xcite , which corresponds to the state of highest ( but finite ) temperature and lowest entropy .",
    "the configuration of minimal mass should be identified with the ground state of the hawking evaporation process .    in order to build realistic models ,",
    "one should however take into account that in string theory other scalar fields are present in the spectrum in addition to the dilaton , as for example the moduli , which originate from the compactification of the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "these also couple to gravity through one - loop effects . at leading order",
    "the coupling term is proportional to the logarithm of a dedekind @xmath1-function of the moduli , which multiplies the term @xcite .",
    "the effect of the non - minimal coupling of the moduli to gravity in a cosmological context has been studied in several papers @xcite and it has been shown that in some cases it may lead to models without initial singularities , but to our knowledge no investigation has been devoted till now to its implications on physics .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that in effective string actions the electromagnetic field exhibits a non - minimal coupling to the dilaton and the moduli similar to that of the term @xcite .",
    "the solutions have been thoroughly studied in this case : if one neglects the moduli , one obtains exact magnetically charged solutions , with secondary scalar hair , the scalar charge being a function of the mass and the magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "if one instead takes into account also one modulus , the general solution can no longer be written in analytic form , but it can nevertheless be shown to depend on three parameters @xcite : thus in this case a new independent parameter arises , besides the mass and the charge , and one may speak of a primary scalar hair .    in this paper , we investigate if a similar phenomenon can occur in the purely gravitational sector . since we are mainly interested in showing the existence of primary scalar hair in the scalar - gravity sector , we consider a simplified model with a dilaton and a unique modulus which couples exponentially with the term .",
    "we study it both in a perturbative and numerical setting using the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we find that in fact the qualitative features are similar to the case of maxwell coupling .",
    "we also find that an upper limit must be imposed on the scalar charges for given mass , in order to avoid naked singularities .",
    "this is reminiscent of the extremality bounds in the multiscalar einstein - maxwell case @xcite .",
    "the structure of our paper is the following . in section 2 we present the perturbative solution and discuss its thermodynamical properties . in section 3",
    "we describe the numerical solution and the occurrence of an upper bound for the scalar charges .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion and the main conclusions .",
    "the bosonic sector of the effective action for the heterotic string in absence of yang - mills and axionic fields , is given at leading order in @xmath2 by i_eff=116d^4 x where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a coupling constant of order unity , @xmath5 is the dilaton , @xmath6 is a modulus , whose coupling with the term , @xmath7 has been taken for simplicity to be of exponential form .",
    "the equations can be written as [ fe ] & & g_=t_^()+t_^( ) , + & & ^2=2,^2=2 , where + & & -8 + & & + 2_m_n - g_mn_m_n , and an alougous expression for @xmath8 .",
    "the total energy - momentum is conserved but , as noticed in @xcite for the case of a single scalar , its time component , corresponding to the total energy , is not positive definite , due to the contribution of the term , leaving room for the possibility of a violation of the no - hair conjecture .",
    "we look for solutions , with scalars @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "a generic metric can be written as [ metric ] -(r)dt^2+^2(r)(r)dr^2+r^2(r)d^2 .",
    "instead of substituting the ansatz ( [ metric ] ) into the field equations ( [ fe ] ) , it is easier to substitute it directly into the action , and then vary with respect to the fields @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the action reads :     + & & -2(1-^r^2 ) ]    the can then be written in the form : [ feq ] +   +   + & & - 2v^(1-^r^2)- r^2 , +   +   + & & = 4v(^-3r)+ 4v^-3r-2r , where @xmath14 and a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "only four of the previous equations are independent .    in order to find approximate solutions to the field equations ,",
    "we adopt the approach of ref . @xcite and expand the fields around the background constituted by the schwarzschild metric with vanishing scalar fields , which is of course a solution for @xmath16 .",
    "our expansion is in the parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the mass of the solution .",
    "since @xmath19 is believed to be of order unity in planck units , the expansion is valid for large @xmath18 , in the region where @xmath20 , i. e. for @xmath21 . for macroscopic black holes ( @xmath22 )",
    "this condition is always satisfied , except in a neighborhood of the singularity , well inside the horizon ( region of strong curvature ) . in particular ,",
    "the approximation is valid for the discussion of the asymptotic properties of the fields , and the questions concerning the scalar hair . near the physical singularity , however , the higher order corrections to the effective string lagrangian become important and the perturbation theory is no longer reliable .",
    "we shall however discuss this regime using numerical techniques in the next section .",
    "at this point , it must be observed that the ansatz ( [ metric ] ) for the metric is too general and still leaves the possibility of a choice of gauge . in order to perform the perturbative calculations ,",
    "the most convenient choice @xcite is to impose @xmath23 , i.e. [ ghs ] -(r)dt^2 + 1(r)dr^2+r^2(r)d^2 .",
    "this gauge was also used for finding exact charged solutions in effective string theory @xcite .",
    "we expand the fields as follows : [ exp ] & = & _ 0(1+_1+^2_2+^3_3 +  ) , + r & = & r+_1+^2_2+^3_3 + ",
    ", + & = & _ 1+^2_2+^3_3 +  , + & = &  _ 0+_1 + ^2_2 + ^3_3 +  , where @xmath24 .",
    "we have normalized @xmath5 such that @xmath25 at infinity .",
    "this is always possible , by rescaling the coupling constant @xmath0 ( this means that our expansion is actually in @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , it is not possible to rescale independently also @xmath6 , and hence we take @xmath27 at infinity . the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath28 will always appear in the combination @xmath29 .",
    "substituting the expansion ( [ exp ] ) into the ( [ feq ] ) , one obtains at first order ]=24m^2r^4,]=24m^2zr^4 . with the previous ,",
    "requiring regularity at the horizon @xmath30 , the scalar fields are uniquely determined at first order : = z = -1 m ( 1r+mr^2 + 4m^23r^3 ) , the equations for the metric fields are given at the same order by ",
    "= 0,]=-2mr^2 .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions that @xmath31 const , @xmath32 at infinity .",
    "we are still free to choose the boundary conditions at @xmath30 . changing the at @xmath30 yields a reparametrization of the solutions , but no change in their physical properties :",
    "in particular , the relations between the physical quantities , like mass , temperature and entropy , are independent of the parametrization .",
    "the most convenient choice is to require that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are regular at @xmath30 .",
    "this is equivalent to fix the location of the horizon at @xmath30 . with these boundary conditions , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "this choice greatly simplifies the higher order calculations .",
    "we can now evaluate the second order corrections . with the stated boundary conditions , the equations for the second order perturbations give +   +   +   + & & + 8mr-2mr^2(+z)-16mr-3mr^3(+z),whose solution is & & _ 2=_2z^2=-1m^3 ( 7360r+73m60r^2 + 73m^245r^3 + 73m^330r^4 + 112m^475r^5 + 8m^59r^6 ) , + & & _ 2=-1 + z^2m^2 ( 12r+2m3r^2 + 7m^23r^3 + 16m^35r^4 + 24m^45r^5 ) , + & & _ 2=- 1 + z^2m^3 ( 16r+m3r^2 + 4m^23r^3 - 14m^33r^4 - 136m^415r^5 -272m^515r^6).up to this order , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are proportional in this gauge .",
    "however , in order to clarify the structure of the solutions , it is useful to go to the next order , even if such corrections would of course be modified by taking into account terms of order @xmath37 in the action .",
    "a long but straightforward calculation gives _",

    "moreover , the functional dependences of the dilaton and the modulus on @xmath15 are different if @xmath39 .",
    "the perturbative solutions have the following properties : a horizon is present at @xmath30 , while a singularity is located at the zero of @xmath13 ; the evaluation of this zero is however outside the range of validity of our approximation .",
    "it can be expected nevertheless that for small values of the mass , or great values of @xmath40 , the zero can occur for @xmath41 , leading to the presence of naked singularities .",
    "this will be confirmed by the numerical results of next section .",
    "the mass @xmath42 of the black hole can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of the metric function @xmath11 and is given by [ mass ] m = m(1 + 112 ^ 2(1+z^2)m^4 + 73360 ^ 3(1+z^3)m^6 ) .",
    "its value is greater than that of the with equal radius .",
    "analogously , from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath5 and @xmath6 one can deduce the scalar charges @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which , in terms of the mass @xmath42 , turn out to be & & d_=m(1 + 7360m^2 + 17110 + 4599z^27560 ^ 2m^4 ) , + & & d_=zm(1 + 7360zm^2 + 4599 + 17110z^27560 ^ 2m^4 ) .",
    "it is clear that , contrary to the case in which only one scalar field is present @xcite , the scalar charges are no longer function only of the mass of the black hole , but depend also on another parameter , which we identify with @xmath40 .",
    "hence , in analogy with the dilaton - modulus gravity non - minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field @xcite , also in this case a primary scalar hair is present in the solution .",
    "this gives an example of primary scalar hair in pure gravity models .",
    "we notice that , at leading order , @xmath45 .",

    ", the thermodynamical quantities of course do not differ much from their background values , except that now they depend on the further parameter @xmath40 .",
    "they behave differently only for @xmath51 , where however the approximation breaks down .",
    "it is interesting to notice that all the thermodynamical quantities are expanded in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "as discussed previously , the perturbative solution is not valid in the whole domain of definition of the solution .",
    "since we are not able to find the exact analytical solution of the field equations , we use the numerical approach described in ref .",
    "for this calculation it is more convenient to choose a gauge in which the metric function @xmath13 is identified with the radial coordinate @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
