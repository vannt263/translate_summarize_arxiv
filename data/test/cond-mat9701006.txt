    "cellular structures@xcite appear in a wide range of natural phenomena , and have puzzled and fascinated scientists for decades@xcite .",
    "they can be generally described as packings of space - filling cells of roughly polygonal shape , separated by thin interfaces to which a surface energy is associated .",
    "they arise as a consequence of competition between domains under the constraint of space - filling , and there is often some mechanism , such as the migration of a conserved quantity across the interface , which makes them evolve in time , i.e. coarsen . +",
    "foams such as those obtained by shaking soapy water are the examples of cellular structures closest to our everyday experience .",
    "two - dimensional foams may be obtained by confining a soap froth between two closely spaced glass plates . in spite of their apparent simplicity , foams display much of the phenomenology appearing in coarsening cellular structures .",
    "foams have been the subject of interest since their relevance in the problem of grain growth was pointed out by smith@xcite . despite the attention they have received , the understanding of their dynamical properties proved to be a tricky problem .",
    "even some of the most basic issues , such as their asymptotic scaling properties , has been a matter of debate until recently ( see references above ) .",
    "numerically exact simulation procedures@xcite , as well as analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite approximations , have been useful in understanding the dynamics of ideal foams , but the system sizes accessible to available simulation procedures are strongly limited ( for a complete account see refs.@xcite ) . + a satisfactory theoretical framework for the description of foams has not yet been achieved .",
    "the main result of this work consists in establishing a _ rigorous connection _ between foams and partitions(vp ) .",
    "this connection provides a set of fundamental degrees of freedom for the foam ( the source s locations in space ) and therefore constitutes a step towards the above mentioned theoretical understanding . on the other hand , an efficient method for the numerical simulation of ideal foams",
    "would also be highly desirable , and we propose that such a method could be obtained by exploiting the equivalence between foams and vp reported in this work .",
    "more precisely , we establish the following _ correspondence _ between equilibrated two - dimensional foams ( ef ) and a generalization of vps , the sectional multiplicative partition ( smvp ) : + _ given an arbitrary ef , it is always possible to find sources in space such that a smvp with respect to them exactly gives this foam . _ + in section  [ sec : tessellations ] the vp and its generalizations are reviewed .",
    "the simplest generalizations of the vp concept are the sectional partition and the multiplicative partition .",
    "these correspond to adding a constant to the ( square ) distance and to multiplying it by a constant respectively . at the end of this section a combination of",
    "both is introduced , the sectional multiplicative partition .",
    "we will use this partition in order to describe foams .",
    "+ the demonstration of the above mentioned correspondence between foams and smvps is divided in two parts ( sections [ sec : smvprecognition ] and [ sec : equilibrium ] ) for clarity . in section  [ sec : smvprecognition ] , the _ recognition problem _ for smvps is solved .",
    "the recognition problem consists in giving the sufficient geometrical conditions that a circular partition has to satisfy in order to be a smvp .",
    "we will see that if a circular partition has all of its vertices _ aligned _ and admits an _ oriented reciprocal figure _",
    ", then it is a smvp . in other words",
    ", it is always possible to find sources in three - dimensional space that give this circular partition as a smvp . in this section",
    "we also describe the procedure to _ find _ the sources when these conditions are met .",
    "some material that is needed in this section is described in the appendix .",
    "+ section  [ sec : equilibrium ] deals with the equilibrium conditions for foams and its geometrical consequences .",
    "we start by writing the force and pressure equilibrium conditions in compact form in section  [ sec : eq_equations ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : eq_align ] and [ sec : eq_reciprocal ] it is shown that an equilibrated foam has all of its vertices _ aligned _ and admits an _ oriented reciprocal figure _ respectively .",
    "therefore all equilibrated foams satisfy the conditions required in section  [ sec : smvprecognition ] , and can be described as smvps . + finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] the implications of this result are discussed , and some perspectives for future work are advanced .",
    "given a set of @xmath2 point - like _ sources _ @xmath3 in @xmath4-space , the _ partition _ ( vp ) or _ tessellation _ of space with respect to @xmath3 is a classification of space into _ cells _",

    "it is common to use these constructions , and their generalizations , as _ approximate _ models for cellular structures occurring in nature@xcite . +",
    "two neighboring cells @xmath5 and @xmath11 are delimited by an _ interface _ @xmath12 of points @xmath7 equidistant from @xmath8 and @xmath13 . @xmath14",
    "these interfaces are @xmath15-dimensional hyperplanes normal to @xmath16 . in two dimensions @xmath5 are convex polygons and the interfaces @xmath12 are straight lines ( fig .",

    "all vertices are of multiplicity three .",
    "+ the concept defining partitions is _",
    "equidistance_. a simple way to generalize them is changing the way in which distances to the sources are measured .",
    "one lets each source measure the distance to points @xmath7 according to its own `` rule '' .",
    "the interface @xmath12 is then the set of points @xmath7 for which two neighbors `` claim '' the same distance .",
    "two simple ways to do this are : adding an arbitrary constant to the square of the distance ( sectional partition  @xcite ) , and , multiplying the distance by a constant ( multiplicative partition  @xcite ) .      a _ sectional partition _ ( svp )",
    "is defined  @xcite as a @xmath21-dimensional cut of a higher dimensional partition .",
    "the sources @xmath22 of the sectional partition are defined as the projections of the original sources @xmath3 onto this lower dimensional @xmath21-space .",
    "cell @xmath5 associated to source @xmath0 is the intersection of cell @xmath23 ( associated to @xmath8 ) with this @xmath21-dimensional hyperplane . for example , take sources @xmath3 in three dimensions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : svpview ] ) and construct a vp with three - dimensional cells @xmath24 and plane interfaces @xmath25 .",
    "now project the sources @xmath26 onto the @xmath27 plane ( which we call the @xmath28 plane ) to obtain the projected sources @xmath29 , which have associated `` heights '' @xmath30 .",

    "this defines the a sectional partition of @xmath28 with respect to sources @xmath22 with heights @xmath30 .",
    "cells @xmath5 are thus defined as @xmath31 where @xmath10 is the distance , on the @xmath28 plane , between @xmath0 and point @xmath7 .",
    "+ in the same way , interfaces @xmath12 are defined as @xmath32 properties of these partitions in two dimensions are :    * interfaces are straight lines and ( generically ) meet at triple vertices .",
    "( in dimension @xmath33 , vertices have multiplicity @xmath34 ) . * interface @xmath12 is normal to @xmath1 , but not in general equidistant from @xmath0 and @xmath35 . *",
    "the partition is unchanged if all @xmath30 are changed according to : @xmath36 for @xmath37 an arbitrary real .",
    "an important difference with the partition , is that in this case there may be sources to which no cell is associated .",
    "this happens if @xmath23 is not cut by @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to see that svps are _ equivalent _ to laguerre partitions  @xcite .",
    "+ appendix  [ sec : rprecognition ] discusses the _ recognition problem _ for this kind of partitions , that is giving the sufficient conditions for an arbitrary rectilinear partition to be a svp .",
    "we will use similar concepts in section  [ sec : smvprecognition ] in order to solve the recognition problem for sectional multiplicative partitions . + as an example of the application of sectional partitions , consider the case of sources @xmath8 whose location in space changes in time , giving rise to a time - dependent partition of @xmath28 .",
    "if for example source @xmath38 moves away from @xmath28 , the two - dimensional cell @xmath39 will shrink and finally disappear when @xmath40 no longer cuts @xmath28 . therefore the number of cells can vary without changing the number of sources .",
    "thus sectional partitions can be used as dynamical models for crystal growth  @xcite , and other processes in which some cells disappear or are created .      the multiplicative partition ( mvp )  @xcite is defined by assigning to each source @xmath8 a positive _ intensity _ @xmath41 , and defining the _ multiplicative distance _ @xmath42 .",

    "let @xmath45 be the distance between two sources @xmath8 and @xmath13 , and @xmath46 . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath47 .",
    "this means that @xmath13 has the smallest intensity and therefore @xmath11 will be the interior of a hypersphere , while @xmath5 will be its exterior .",
    "the following properties are satisfied in any dimension .",
    "* @xmath8 is contained in @xmath5 .",
    "* @xmath12 has radius , and its center @xmath48 is on the straight line going through @xmath8 and @xmath13 . *",
    "@xmath48 is located at a distance @xmath49 from @xmath8 , that is , it never lays between @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "three sources give rise to a tessellation like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvp_vertex_2d ] .",
    "the exterior of the two `` bubbles '' is the infinite cell associated to the source with the largest intensity , @xmath38 in this example .",
    "for some choices of @xmath50 the interfaces will not intersect . in this case",
    "the tessellation is simply a pair of circles , each containing one of the sources with smaller intensities , while the exterior of these two circles is the cell of the source with larger intensity .",
    "mvps can be interpreted again as `` areas of influence '' of sources @xmath8 , but now each source has a different strength . + consider a mvp of two dimensional space with respect to a set of sources @xmath3 . if three interfaces @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 meet at a vertex ( again , vertices of higher multiplicity are only possible for particular configurations , which we ignore here ) , then centers @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 lay on a line .",
    "the reason why this is so is simple . if two interfaces @xmath12 and @xmath17 have a common point @xmath19 , then their _ continuations _ must meet again at another point @xmath53 , the _ conjugate vertex_. but then the third interface @xmath54 must also go through this point since @xmath55 and @xmath56 implies @xmath57 . therefore",
    "two points exist ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) at which all three circles intersect",
    ". then the centers of these circles must be on a line ( fig .",

    "+ let us define a _",
    "circular partition_(cp ) of two - dimensional space to be a classification of space in cells delimited by arbitrary circle arcs that meet at triple points called vertices .",
    "no three centers of these arbitrarily defined interfaces will in general be on a line .",
    "we will say that a vertex of a cp is _ aligned _ if the centers of the three interfaces defining it are on a line .",
    "as we saw , all vertices of a mvp are aligned in 2d .",
    "therefore for each triple vertex of a mvp in 2d , the three sources and the three centers form the configuration  @xcite @xmath60 of projective geometry . since @xmath48 can not be between @xmath0 and @xmath35 , the three centers can only be on one of the two external segments of the configuration .",
    "+ in a three - dimensional mvp , four cells meet at each vertex @xmath61 , giving rise to six spherical interfaces @xmath62 .",
    "the centers of these interfaces are aligned in triplets so that the six centers also form the configuration @xmath60 , this time in three - dimensional space .",
    "this has the implication that the six centers are necessarily on the same plane .",
    "+ the mvp was first introduced by boots  @xcite to describe areas of influence in geography .",
    "ash and bolker  @xcite also studied the recognition problem , that is , under which conditions a cp is a mvp .",
    "the visual similarity between this kind of partitions and two - dimensional foams is striking , and suggests the idea to find a connection between them .",
    "obviously the centers of the films of a foam must be aligned for each triple vertex , if the foam is to be described as a mvp , since mvps are aligned .",
    "one finds  @xcite that this alignment condition is indeed satisfied by all vertices of arbitrary equilibrated foams . despite this ( which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a foam to be a mvp )",
    ", two - dimensional mvps can not describe all possible equilibrated foams in two dimensions .",
    "this work shows the reason of this limitation : in order to describe arbitrary equilibrated two - dimensional foams we must introduce the sectional variant of a multiplicative partition . in other words , instead of confining the sources to the plane , we let them exist in a three - dimensional space and obtain the foam as _ a two - dimensional cut of a three - dimensional mvp_.      we will restrict the description to the case of a plane cut of a three dimensional mvp .",
    "the generalization to a @xmath21-dimensional cut of an @xmath4-dimensional mvp is straightforward .",
    "+ a plane cut , with a plane @xmath63 , of a three - dimensional mvp defines a sectional multiplicative partition ( smvp ) of @xmath28 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : smvp_vertex ] and [ fig : smvp_upper ] ) .",
    "the sources @xmath0 of this smvp are the normal projections onto @xmath28 of the original sources @xmath8 , and may be seen to have as attributes both an intensity @xmath41 and a height @xmath30 .",
    "cells @xmath64 associated to sources @xmath0 are defined as @xmath65 in the same way , interfaces @xmath12 are circle arcs satisfying @xmath66 an example of a smvp with three sources is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : smvp_vertex ] and [ fig : smvp_upper ] .",
    "we see that there are two vertices on @xmath28 at which the three interfaces meet . in a general case ( for example in a partition with respect to many sources like in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvp2d - many ] ) , if vertex @xmath19 exists , then the continuations of interfaces @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 meet at a _ conjugate _ vertex @xmath53 also .",
    "this implies the alignment of centers @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which could also be deduced from the alignment of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in three - dimensions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smvp_vertex ] ) .",
    "+ we notice that the smvp is equivalent to a multiplicative laguerre partition , since a svp is equivalent to a laguerre partition  @xcite .",
    "as is usual in sectional partitions , in the smvp there may be sources @xmath0 with no associated cell , those for which the corresponding three - dimensional `` bubble '' @xmath23 does not cut @xmath28 .",

    "in this section the sufficient conditions for a cp to be a smvp are given . we first introduce the notion of oriented reciprocal figure for cps , and then proceed to demonstrate that an aligned cp admitting such a reciprocal figure is a smvp .",
    "we will now generalize the concept of reciprocal figure as appropriate for circular partitions .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath70 made of points @xmath0 connected by edges @xmath71 forms a reciprocal figure for a cp @xmath72 if ,    * points @xmath0 are in correspondence with the cells @xmath5 of @xmath73 .",

    "we saw already that all smvps are aligned ( all vertices satisfy the alignment condition introduced in sec .  [",
    "sec : mvp ] ) . on the other hand , it is clear that the sources @xmath0 of a smvp form a reciprocal figure that satisfies orientation .",
    "therefore @xmath75 figure  [ fig : convexity ] shows four possible partitions that share the same centers @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . all four admit reciprocal figures .",

    "therefore neither b ) nor c ) can be a smvp .",
    "the reason is that the orientation condition can not be satisfied if any of the vertices is not _ convex_. a vertex is _ convex _ if all the internal angles formed by the interfaces are less than @xmath79 .",

    "three degrees of freedom come from the determination of the reciprocal figure itself ( since a dilatation and/or translation of a reciprocal figure is again a reciprocal figure ) and the last one from @xmath303 .",

    "the reason is that the edges of the reciprocal figure can be taken to represent forces transmitted by the edges of the original framework ( rotated by @xmath307 ) .",
    "since these edges form closed polygons , the existence of a reciprocal figure implies the existence of an equilibrated set of internal stresses in the absence of external load .",
    "the addition of the orientation condition ( a condition not required by maxwell s definition of a reciprocal figure ) has the statical consequence that all signs of the stresses are equal , for example all traction or all compression .",

    "* angles are preserved ( in modulus ) by the inversion .    given two points @xmath251 and @xmath254 at distances @xmath205 and @xmath291 from the inversion center , the distance @xmath316 between them transforms as @xmath317 using this result we can easily see that the inversion is a `` symmetry '' of a mvp in any dimension if the intensities are also appropriately transformed  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a mvp of @xmath318 with respect to sources @xmath22 with intensities @xmath50 is transformed by an inversion into a mvp with respect to @xmath319 with intensities @xmath320 , where the new intensities satisfy @xmath321 here @xmath322 is an arbitrary prefactor , the same for all @xmath41 s , and @xmath190 is the distance between source @xmath247 and the inversion center @xmath308 . to see this",
    "it suffices to demonstrate that if @xmath323 then after an inversion , @xmath324 , which is easily done using ( [ eq : mvpinterface ] ) , ( [ eq : dist_transf ] ) and ( [ eq : transforma ] ) .",
    "the inversion transformation is of course also a symmetry of the smvp ( section  [ sec : smvp ] ) , if the inversion center @xmath308 is on the cutting plane @xmath28 , since in this case the inversion leaves this plane invariant .",
    "+ if the inversion center @xmath308 happens to be located on an interface @xmath12 of a mvp ( initially a spherical surface ) , the transformed interface @xmath101 is a plane not through @xmath308 .",
    "the resulting interface thus corresponds to a partition with respect to sources @xmath247 and @xmath248 in their new locations .",
    "therefore the transformed intensities @xmath325 and @xmath326 have to be equal after the inversion , which is verified using ( [ eq : transforma ] ) @xmath327 in the same way a smvp with respect to two sources @xmath247 and @xmath248 is transformed into a svp if @xmath328 .",
    "the intensities @xmath41 are transformed according to ( [ eq : transforma ] ) , where @xmath190 is the distance between @xmath308 and source @xmath8 in three - dimensional space .",
    "the way in which heights @xmath30 transform is easily found using ( [ eq : inversion ] ) . notice that if the inversion center coincides with the location of a conjugate vertex @xmath59 , then the transformed partition has a rectilinear vertex since three interfaces are simultaneously transformed into straight lines .",
