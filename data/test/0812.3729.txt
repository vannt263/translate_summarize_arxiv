    "it is by now a well - known and commonly accepted result of the stellar evolution theory that stars of low and intermediate mass will end their lives as white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "since the pioneering papers by chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) and stoner ( 1932 ) , it has been known that there must be an upper limit of the mass of wds .",
    "the current value for such a limit , now universally known as chandrasekhar s mass , is m@xmath1= 1.456 ( 2/@xmath2)@xmath3 m@xmath0(where @xmath2 is the electronic mean molecular weight , hansen , kawaler & trimble 2004 ) . below this critical mass",
    "there are essentially three different families of wds concerning the chemical composition of their cores : the o / ne / mg , c / o and he .",
    "the upper mass limit for c / o wds , which is still subject to some debate , since it is the aftermath of the evolution of a star with initial mass slightly lower than m@xmath4 , the lowest mass for star that succeeds in igniting carbon burning before the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , it is around 1.05 m@xmath0(dominguez et al .",

    "2008 , meng , cheng & han 2008 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the value for the minimum mass of wds with a c / o core is commonly believed to be around 0.5 m@xmath0 ( weideman 2000 , meng et al .",
    "the theory of stellar evolution predicts that an isolated single star with mass lower than about 0.5 m@xmath0 , the exact value depending on the chemical composition ( 0.46 and 0.50 for z=0.04 and z=0.0001 , respectively , dominguez et al .",
    "1999 , girardi 1999 ) , do not ignite the helium - burning and die as wds with an helium rich core .",
    "for these stars , during the red giant phase the electronic thermal conduction and the emission of neutrinos , which cool the core , prevail on the heating due to the contraction caused by the accretion of fresh helium processed by the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "this is the main reason why wds of mass less than about 0.5 m@xmath0 are commonly believed to have a he - core .    on the other hand ,",
    "as early as 1985 iben & tutukov , in a very beautiful and instructive paper , showed that a star with an initial mass of 3 m@xmath0 evolving in a close binary can produce a remnant of 0.4 m@xmath0 with a sizeable c / o core .",
    "a similar result was obtained 15 years later by han , tout & eggleton ( 2000 ) , who computed the evolution of close binary systems with several different parameters .",
    "they showed that in a binary system with the primary star of mass m@xmath5= 2.51 m@xmath0 , the mass ratio q = m@xmath5/m@xmath6=2 and the initial period p=2.559 d , the primary star succeeded to ignite the helium - burning .",
    "they did not followed the evolution of the remnant c / o wd , since their code met numerical problems when the primary star was as low as 0.33 m@xmath0 with a c / o core of 0.11 m@xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate both a possible evolutionary scenario able to produce c / o wds of low mass , that is m @xmath7 m@xmath0 , and their cooling evolution .",
    "we will show the results of detailed evolutionary computations performed with a full henyey code able to follow consistently the evolution of stars from the initial pre - main sequence to the final cooling phase of wds .",
    "the stellar models showed in the present work have been computed with an updated version of franec ( prada moroni & straniero 2002 , deglinnocenti et al .",
    "2008 ) , a full henyey evolutionary code .",
    "we adopted a metallicity z=0.04 and an initial helium abundance y=0.32 suitable for the very metal - rich stars belonging to some open galactic cluster , such as ngc6791 .",
    "mass of the hydrogen exhausted core as a function of the age for a star of m=2.3 m@xmath0 , z=0.04 y=0.32 .",

    "mass of the hydrogen exhausted core as a function of the age for a star of m=2.3 m@xmath0 , z=0.04 y=0.32 .",
    "the circles mark : the central hydrogen exhaustion , the base and the tip of the rgb and the central helium exhaustion . ]",
    "the figure [ mhetip ] shows the mass of the hydrogen exhausted core m@xmath8 at the first thermal pulse on the agb ( upper curve ) and the mass of the helium core m@xmath9 at the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb tip , lower curve ) as a function of the initial mass .",
    "as it is well known , m@xmath8 at the first thermal pulse is nearly constant around 0.55 m@xmath0 , the exact value depending on the chemical composition , for initial masses lower than 3 m@xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the m@xmath9 at the tip of rgb as a function of the initial mass is much less smooth than the previous one , in particular a deep and sharp minimum is present around 2.3 m@xmath0 for this chemical composition ( castellani , chieffi , straniero 1992 ) .",
    "such a behavior is the consequence of the physical conditions present in the helium - core at the onset of the 3@xmath10 nuclear reaction .    for initial mass lower than 1.5 - 1.7 m@xmath0",
    ", an electron - degenerate core develops at the beginning of the red giant phase , and the onset of the 3@xmath10 occurs in a nuclear runaway , the so - called helium - flash ( hoyle & schwarzschild 1955 ) . for these stars ,",
    "the m@xmath9 at the tip of the rgb is almost constant , about 0.46 m@xmath0 for metal - rich stars and 0.50 m@xmath0 for metal - poor ones , and is essentially produced during the hydrogen - shell burning phase .",
    "from this point on , the larger the initial mass , the weaker the degeneracy of the core in the red giant phase , thus the weaker the he - flash and the lower the mass of the helium - core required for the 3@xmath10 burning . when the initial mass is as high as about 2.3 m@xmath0 , the helium - burning ignites quiescently , without a flash .",
    "this explains the steep decrease of the m@xmath9 at the tip of the rgb between 1.8 and 2.3 m@xmath0 . for higher masses",
    ", the core in the red giant phase is not degenerate any more . from this point on ,",
    "the larger the initial mass , the larger the m@xmath9 at the tip of the rgb , as the larger the convective core during the previous main sequence phase .",
    "thus , the minimum mass of the helium - core m@xmath9 at the onset of the 3@xmath10 occurs in the transition between these two regimes , around 2.3 m@xmath0 , reaching a value of 0.315 m@xmath0 .",
    "notice that , as previously stated , this deep minimum is almost canceled at the first thermal pulse . in fact , the hydrogen burning shell continues to process hydrogen and move outward , then increasing m@xmath8 , during the central helium - burning phase .",
    "moreover , it is a well established result of the theory of stellar evolution that the lower the mass of the he - core at the onset of the 3@xmath10 , the fainter the star and the longer the central helium - burning phase .",
    "thus , as the initial mass of the helium - rich core decreases the hydrogen - burning shell will work for a longer time resulting in an larger @xmath11m@xmath8 .",
    "this is the reason why star with initial mass lower than 3 m@xmath0 enter the agb phase with nearly the same m@xmath8 ( dominguez et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the first paper devoted to the study of the evolutionary characteristics of stars belonging to this sharp and deep minimum in the mass of the he - core at the tip of the red giant phase was iben ( 1967 ) .",
    "since then , many studies have been focused on this transition , named by renzini & buzzoni ( 1983 ) red giant phase transition ( hereafter rgb phase transition ) , but a detailed discussion of such an important feature is well beyond the aim of the present paper .",
    "we will dwell only upon a feature of the evolution of a star with m= 2.3 m@xmath0 important to our purpose .",
    "figure [ mheage2p3 ] shows the evolution of the mass of the hydrogen - exhausted core m@xmath8 for this transition mass .",
    "the circles mark the following evolutionary phases : the central - hydrogen exhaustion , the base and the tip of the rgb , respectively , and finally the central - helium exhaustion . as one can easily see , when the star exhausts its central hydrogen , the mass of the he - core is already 0.225 m@xmath0 , which is more than the 70% of the value at the rgb tip . in fact , a sizeable convective core was developed during the preavious main sequence phase .",
    "when the star reaches the base of the rgb , the mass of the helium core is 0.254 m@xmath0 , which is about the 80% of the mass required to onset he - burning .",
    "this means that , since a large fraction of the helium - core required for the ignition of the he - burning is already developed at the beginning of the red giant evolution , a star in the rgb phase transition , that is around 2.3 m@xmath0 , that undergoes a very strong mass loss during the red giant phase can produce a c / o wd with a mass significative lower than 0.5 m@xmath0 .",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.461 m@xmath0 . ]",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.461 m@xmath0 . ]    in order to check such an idea and provide models of c / o wds with mass lower than 0.5 m@xmath0 , we computed the evolution at constant mass of a star with m=2.3 m@xmath0 until the red giant phase . then at about @xmath12=1.34 , when the he - core was m@xmath9= 0.2569 m@xmath0 , we turned on the mass loss , with a constant rate of the order of 10@xmath13 m@xmath0 yr@xmath14 .",
    "we stopped the mass loss once the desired final mass was obtained and then we followed the next evolution until the final cooling phase .",
    "the figures [ m0p48 ] - [ m0p33a ] show the evolutionary tracks in the hr - diagram for different values of the final mass , from 0.48 m@xmath0 to 0.33 m@xmath0 , from the red giant to the final wd phase .",
    "the model showed in figure [ m0p48 ] , with a total mass of 0.48 m@xmath0 , succeded to ignite he - burning and become a wd with a c / o core whose mass fraction is about 89 % , where we defined the core edge to be the point where the helium abundance became larger than 50% .",
    "a very similar evolution is followed by the model with 0.461 m@xmath0 , as can be seen in figure [ m0p461 ] . in this case",
    ", the resulting wd has a c / o core of 85% of the total mass .",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.38 m@xmath0 . ]",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.38 m@xmath0 . ]",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.33 m@xmath0 . in this case the model ignites he - burning and eventually cools as a c / o - core wd . ]",
    "same as in figure [ m0p48 ] but for a remnant of mass m=0.33 m@xmath0 . in this case",
    "the model ignites he - burning and eventually cools as a c / o - core wd . ]",
    "the evolution becomes more complex and difficult to compute for lower masses .",
    "the figure [ m0p43 ] shows the evolution of the model with 0.43 m@xmath0 .",
    "the star onsets the 3@xmath10 nuclear reaction and after the central he - burning phase it experiences a series of he - shell thermal pulses : during each flash the star describes a loop in the hr diagram . after the end of the thermal pulses the helium - burning shell continues quiescently and the model moves toward higher effective tempearures .",
    "then the star , approaching the cooling track , experiences a few strong hydrogen - shell flashes , more specifically cno - flashes . during these episodes , the hydrogen rich outermost layer",
    "is progressively eroded , until the star can cool down as a wd with a c / o core of 79% of the total mass .",
    "the evolution of the model with 0.38 m@xmath0 , shown in figure [ m0p38 ] , presents again both the he - thermal pulses and the cno - flashes .",
    "in addition , after the end of themal pulses , when the model moves toward the blue it experiences a late thermal pulse .",
    "the resulting wd has a c / o core of 50% of the total mass .",
    "notice that the lower the mass of the remnant , the lower the mass fraction of the c / o core , thus the larger the mass of the helium - rich buffer . in standard c / o wd ,",
    "the thickness of the he - rich layer is of the order of a few percent ( 1 - 2% ) , while in the present models of very low mass c / o wds it can reach the 50% of the total mass .",
    "notice that the helium - shell thermal pulses we showed above are not the same that occur in agb stars .",
    "in fact , in that case the thermal instability is the consequence of the accumulation of a critical mass of helium accreted by the quiescent hydrogen - burning shell . while in this case , they are self - excited relaxation oscillations , where the compression is due to the relaxation of the star after a previous contraction . at variance with thermal pulses in agb",
    ", these pulses affect the entire star , with large oscillations in central temperature and density , as early shown in the pioneering paper by iben et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "the evolution of the remntant with mass m= 0.33 m@xmath0 deserves a detailed discussion .",
    "in fact , adopting the same mass loss rate along the red giant phase of the progenitor star of 2.3 m@xmath0 as in the previous cases , the 0.33 m@xmath0 does not experience 3@xmath10 burning and becomes a wd with a helium core .",
    "figure [ m0p33a ] shows the related evolutionary track on the hr diagram . on the other hand , if the mass loss is turned on later on the rgb phase of the progenitor star , when the mass of the helium core is larger ( @xmath15 1% ) , the final model with 0.33 m@xmath0 succeeds to ignite he - burning and eventually evolves to the final wd stage with a c / o core of about the 53% of the total mass .",
    "figure [ m0p33b ] shows its evolutionary track .",
    "this is the lowest c / o wd we managed to produce for this chemical composition , in fact the models with mass smaller than 0.33 m@xmath0 do not ignite the 3@xmath10 and finish their evolution as he - core wds .",
    "the present evolutionary computations prove that it is possible to have c / o wds with mass as low as 0.33 m@xmath0 , significantly lower than 0.5 m@xmath0 , the classical and commonly accepted lower limit .",
    "this means that in the mass range 0.33 - 0.5 m@xmath0 both he and c / o core wds can exist .",
    "thus it is interesting to compare the main characteristics of their structure and evolution .",

    "figure [ profili ] shows the comparison between the core chemical profiles of the two remnants of 0.33 m@xmath0 .",
    "while in one case the core is constituted by nearly pure helium , in the other a mixture of carbon and oxygen is present .",
    "notice that in the center there is a significant abundance of carbon , x@xmath16= 0.285 , as in standard c / o wds , thus these very low mass wds should not be called simply oxygen wds . as previously stated , a peculiar feature of these very low mass c / o wds is that the helium - rich buffer is very thick , up to about 50% of the total mass , while the value of typical c / o wds is of the order of 1 - 2 % .",
    "the thickness of the hydrogen rich outermost layer is almost the same in the two models , that is m= 0.0014 m@xmath17 for the wd with a helium rich core and m= 0.0015 m@xmath17 for that with c / o one .",
    "figure [ cooling ] shows the comparison between the cooling curves of the he - core wd ( dashed line ) and the c / o core ( solid line ) .",
    "as expected , the remnant with the helium rich core cools slower than that with a c / o one , as the specific heat per gram of helium is larger than that of carbon and oxygen ; thus the thermal content of the he wd is larger than that of a c / o one with the same total mass .",
    "such a difference in the cooling times is slightely counterbalanced at @xmath18 -4 as the c / o core crystallizes , with the concomitant energy release , while the he core does not , in the presently computed range of temperatures and densities .",
    "figures [ rte ] and [ gte ] show the comparison between the radii and surface gravities , respectively , as a function of the effective temperature for the two wds of 0.33 m@xmath0 . for a given effective temperature ,",
    "the he - core wd is more expanded than the other one , difference not negligible at the beginning of the cooling ( @xmath19 8.5% ) .",

    "we did not show the plot with the central temperatures t@xmath21 versus luminosity relations for the two wds because they are nearly identical .",
    "in conclusion , as already anticipated by iben & tutukov ( 1985 ) , we proved , by means of fully and consistent evolutionary computations , that the minimum mass for a c / o wd is about 0.33 m@xmath0 , near the minimum possible mass of the helium - core at the onset of he - burning , which occurs at the rgb phase transition ( m@xmath22 2.3 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "as a consequence , in the mass range 0.33 - 0.5 m@xmath0 both he and c / o core wds can exist . as expected and already shown by panei et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the cooling times of these two classes of wds are quite different , being the he - core remnants significantly slower than the c / o ones . in addition , we showed also that the he wds are more expanded that their c / o counterparts at a given effective temperature .",
