    "now the staggered spin has a nonzero @xmath101-component ( small blue arrow ) , which may be detected by bragg scattering . ]    recent numerical calculations point out that a sufficient polarization of the sample ( @xmath196 ) favors a staggered magnetization lying in the @xmath194-plane of the bloch sphere @xcite . this response to a spin imbalance is analogous to the response of an electronic antiferromagnet to a magnetic field and can be explained in terms of a n anisotropic spin susceptibility . as illustrated in fig .",
