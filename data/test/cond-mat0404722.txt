    "first , it unifies various dmftschemes .",
    "for example , the treatment of correlated hopping@xcite , the single site dmft  of the hubbard model ( see section iii ) , and the extended dmft@xcite are all limiting cases of this unified approach .",
    "second , besides unifying different dmft schemes , this formulation is sufficiently general to be a starting point for expansions around dmft .",
    "one possibility is described in the appendix .",
    "in addition , the formulation in terms of hubbard operators makes it an ideal framework for a dmft  based renormalization group approach along the lines of ref . .",
    "third , being based on an expansion around the atomic limit , it provides new and valuable insight into the diagrammatics underlying cluster dmft schemes , which will be a subject of a subsequent publication .",

    "an extension of this approach to the case of correlated hopping was developed by shvaika@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to obtain a generalization of the dmft equations that describe the physics of a generic lattice model for interacting fermions , starting from a renormalized strong - coupling expansion around the atomic limit@xcite . within this scheme ,",
    "all the non - local contributions to the hamiltonian , for example hopping terms , spin - spin interaction terms , or non - local coulomb interaction contributions , are treated on equal footing .",
    "let us consider a system described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "the first step in our derivation is to write an expansion for the grand - canonical potential and the greens functions for the @xmath46-operators in terms of `` hopping '' matrix elements @xmath47 and bare cumulants . starting with the statistical operator @xmath48 we can write the grand - canonical potential as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the grand - canonical potential in the atomic limit ,",

    "further , using linked - cluster type arguments@xcite one can show that only the connected diagrams contribute .",
    "the basic diagrammatic rules are similar to those given by metzner@xcite for the hubbard model .",
    "however , the internal lines corresponding to `` hopping '' matrix elements will carry two extra pairs of indices @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( one for each end of the line ) representing the single - site states .",

    "the general rules are analogous to those for the hubbard model@xcite , with the difference that extra indices ( associated with the single - site states ) are carried by the `` hopping '' matrix elements and the bare cumulants .",
    "a special case occurs when bosonic x - operators with non - zero average values , @xmath82 , which we will call q - operators , are present in @xmath76 . in this case , as mentioned before , cumulants of order n with n odd may be non - zero , leading to disconnected rooted diagrams in the expansion of @xmath83 . by simply regrouping the contributions from disconnected diagrams we can write : @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the average of the operator @xmath86 with respect to the full hamiltonian , and @xmath87 has a diagrammatic representation containing only connected diagrams . in the rest of this work we will always use the `` connected '' green s functions defined by ( [ green2 ] ) . obviously , if @xmath76 does not contain q - operators , @xmath88 and @xmath89 coincide , as the averages in ( [ green2 ] ) vanish .",

    "due to the fact that the hubbard operators have either bosonic - like or fermionic - like characters , the fourier transformed green s functions , @xmath90 , will have odd matsubara frequency , if both x - operators are fermionic , or even matsubara frequency otherwise . on the other hand",

    "the key in obtaining a renormalized expansion is to introduce the notion of irreducibility with respect to one line ( representing @xmath93 ) .",
    "we define the irreducible two - point cumulant , @xmath99 , as the sum of all connected diagrams having two external legs ( labeled by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ) , with the property that the two legs can not be separated by cutting one line .",
    "this definition differs slightly from the standard definition@xcite , which requires that the diagram be not disconnected by cutting a single line .",
    "the difference comes from the existence of cumulants with odd number of legs .",

    "in contrast , this work assumes a different perspective : rather than viewing dmft as an approximation that becomes exact in the limit of infinite coordination , we see it as the first order approximation in a hierarchy of ( increasing size ) cluster approximations . in this picture , the exact limit is obtained for an infinite - large cluster .",
