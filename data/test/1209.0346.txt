    "the spin orbit coupling ( soc ) , which describes the interaction between the spin and orbit degrees of freedom of a particle , has not only generated many interesting quantum phenomena in modern physics ranging from the nuclear physics to condensed - matter physics , and but also become an important resource for realizing fault - tolerant topological quantum computing @xcite . by controlling the external lasers ,",
    "the different kinds of socs have been proposed to be simulated in the trapped bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with the neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "especially , in recent experiment at nist , the equal rashba and dresselhaus socs has been realized successfully in the ultracold @xmath0rb atoms by a couple of raman lasers @xcite . attributed to this pioneer experiment , the investigation of soc - driven becs has attracted much attentions . moreover , rich many - body phenomena with no analogy in condensed - matter physics ( in becs , all ultracold atoms can occupy the same quantum state ) have been predicted by considering the ground - state properties larson2009,wc , wu , yip2011,yp , yp2,ss , xxu , zhu , hu , zhangdw , zhangdw2,ozawa , deng , weizheng2012,zhai2012,shenoy2012,zfxu , fialko , jr2012 . for example , in the presence of the equal rashba and dresselhaus socs , the bec is made up of two non - orthogonal dressed atom spin states carrying different momenta .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between these spin states are modified , driving a quantum phase transition from a spin - mixed state to a phase - separated state @xcite .",
    "in fact , even if the effective atom interaction governed by both the inter- and intra- spin interactions is not taken into account , a quantum phase transition from a separate phase ( sp ) to a single minimum phase ( smp ) can also occur @xcite .",
    "in very recent experiment , this new quantum phase transition has been observed by measuring the amplitude ratio of spin and momentum oscillation @xcite .",
    "it has been known that quantum phase transitions governed by the ground - state energies occur at absolute zero temperature @xcite .",
    "however , it is unattainable experimentally due to the third law of thermodynamics , i.e. , any system must work at a finite temperature .",
    "thus , it is crucially important to investigate the thermodynamic properties to fully understand the fundamental physics for a given system .",
    "for instance , in the framework of finite - temperature theory , the system s real evaluation can be described more accurately and some important physical quantities such as the specific heat , the entropy and the free energy , which have no zero temperature correspondence , can be explored .",
    "more importantly , some exotic phenomena driven only by thermal fluctuations can be revealed @xcite .",
    "motivated by the experimental developments and the third law of thermodynamics , we , for the first time , develop a quantum field approach to reveal the thermodynamic properties of the trapped bec with the equal rashba and dresselhaus socs .",
    "our main results are given as follows : ( i ) in the experimentally - feasible regime , the phase transition from the sp to the smp can be driven by the tunable temperature . moreover ,",
    "the corresponding critical temperature is derived exactly and is independent of the trapped potential .",
    "( ii ) we find that the specific heat has a large jump at the critical temperature .",
    "this step behavior is quite different from that of the atom population , which varies smoothly when crossing the critical point .",
    "it implies that the temperature - driven phase transition can be well detected by measuring the specific heat .",
    "( iii ) in the different phases , the analytical expressions for the specific heat and the entropy are also given .",
    "in the smp , the specific heat as well as the entropy are governed only by the rabi frequency . however , in the sp , the strong soc modifies the energy structure and thus the thermodynamic statistics . at lower temperature , we find that the specific heat and the entropy in such phase are determined only by the soc strength .",
    "( iv ) finally , the effect of the effective atom interaction is also addressed . in the smp",
    ", no collective excitations can be found in soc - driven bec and thus the effective atom interaction does not affect the thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , in the sp with soc - induced macroscopic excitations , this effective atom interaction affects dramatically on the critical temperature as well as the other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "for example , for the repulsive atom interaction , the critical temperature decreases , and vice versa .",

    "where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the wavevectors of the raman lasers , an effective soc , which is identical to the one - dimensional equal rashba and dresselhaus socs in condensed - matter physics , can be achieved .",
    "moreover , the corresponding hamiltonian with the atom - atom collision interaction can be written from the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations as @xcite @xmath15here , @xmath16 is a harmonic trap mode with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the atom mass .",

    "@xmath32 is the total atom number .",

    "moreover , its magnitude can reach the order of mhz near the feshbach resonant point .",
    "finally , we will take @xmath49 , which is of the order of khz , as the natural unit of the energy for simplicity .",
    "a key step to extract the thermodynamic properties of the soc - driven becs is to obtain the partition function of hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) @xcite . here",
    "we develop a quantum field approach , i.e. , an imaginary - time ( @xmath50 ) functional path - integral technique , to arrive at the target .",
