    "the standard model ( sm ) has been tested at an unprecedented level of precision by various experiments . however , some excesses have not yet been completely resolved .",
    "the first case is the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon @xmath3 ) , where the discrepancy between experimental data and the sm prediction currently is @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the second case is the angular observable @xmath1 of @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath9 deviation , resulting from an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb@xmath10 at the lhcb  @xcite , recently confirmed an earlier result with @xmath11 deviations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same measurement with @xmath12 deviations was reported by belle  @xcite .",
    "also the other relevant @xmath13 observables are defined in ref .",
    "various possible resolutions to this excess have been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "the third excess is that a resonance with a mass of 750 gev in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum was indicated by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments .",
    "the width and spin of the diphoton resonance are still uncertain .",
    "if the resonance is a fundamental particle , its width prefers to be narrow ; however , if it is a composite state , then its width is wide .",
    "the production cross sections for the diphoton excess at @xmath14 tev in the atlas and cms are respectively given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the diphoton resonance .",
    "the challenge of explaining this excess is to obtain the large production cross section shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : data_di ] ) .",
    "various proposals to explain this excess have been broadly studied  @xcite .    to resolve the excesses in a specific framework",
    ", we propose the extension of the sm by including leptoquarks ( lqs ) and one higgs singlet , where the leptoquarks are colored scalars that simultaneously couple to the leptons and quarks , and the higgs singlet is the 750 gev diphoton resonance candidate .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 decays can arise from the tree - level lq - mediated feynman diagrams when the muon @xmath3 is induced from lq loops .",
    "although lepton - flavor violating ( lfv ) processes @xmath4 can put strong constraints on some yukawa couplings , it is found that the wilson coefficient @xmath18 from the lq contributions can satisfy the requirements , which result from the global analysis of @xmath2 , and the muon @xmath3 can fit the current data .",
    "in addition , the results are also consistent with the measurement of the rare flavor - changing process @xmath19 .",
    "it is known that the production cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : data_di ] ) can not be achieved if only a 750 gev particle is added to the sm without introducing other new effects .",
    "therefore , we need not only some new colored particles to produce the resonance , but also some mechanism by which to enhance the branching ratio ( br ) for the resonance decay to diphoton . intriguingly , lqs meet the requirements for the resonance production and diphoton decay .",
