    "nonlinearity of field equations can have pronounced manifestations in physical predictions from the theory .",
    "examples are ubiquitous and well - known : multiple ground states , static solitons , solitary waves , long lived oscillons , blow - up of solutions at a finite time , and many more .",
    "another important effect due to the nonlinearity is that the field can react to the presence of external charges in a rather nontrivial way . in consequence ,",
    "the force between the charges essentially differs from naive expectations based on free field models .",
    "very old , yet still interesting example of this phenomenon is provided by classical non - abelian gauge fields in the presence of static external charges , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied such this aspect of the nonlinearity using the signum - gordon model , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the remarkable simplicity of the field equation in this model enables us to present exact nonperturbative results , in contradistinction to the case of yang - mills field .",
    "the most striking findings are as follows : there are no yukawa or coulomb tails of the field in the region far away from charges ; the charges are totally screened by the field ; the force between them exactly vanishes when they are separated by a distance that exceeds a certain finite value . in the present paper",
    "we corroborate these results by solving the two dimensional case .",
    "let us briefly remind that the signum - gordon model involves a single real scalar field @xmath0 that evolves according to the signum - gordon equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the self - coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath3 function takes the values @xmath4 , in particular @xmath5 .",
    "the lagrangian has the form @xmath6 the field potential @xmath7 is v - shaped ( @xmath8 denotes the modulus ) . the model has been studied in several aspects , such as self - similar solutions @xcite , oscillons ( or rather breathers ) @xcite , and @xmath9-balls or boson stars in the version with a complex scalar field @xcite .",
    "let us add that recently the signum - gordon equation has been discussed in a much wider mathematical framework of the theory of partial differential equations with compressed solutions @xcite",
    ". in general , the model together with its extensions has turned out to be very useful theoretical laboratory in which we can study various above mentioned aspects of nonlinear fields .    in the present paper , similarly as in @xcite , @xcite , we regard the signum - gordon field as the mediating field , which generates a force between two point charges coupled to it . in @xcite , the field generated by the two charges , as well as the force ,",
    "are exactly calculated in one spatial dimension , while in three dimensions approximate formulas are given under the assumption that the point charges are close to each other .",
    "in @xcite we study three - body forces in the one dimensional case .",
    "because the signum - gordon equation is nonlinear one , finding its solutions is generally a nontrivial task , especially in dimensions larger than one . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the two dimensional case . using a formal mathematical connection with the planar electrostatics",
    "we show that also in this case the point charges can be totally screened by a cloud of the scalar field .",
    "this screening is easily seen for a single charge .",
    "the case of two or more charges situated not too far from each other is much more difficult .",
    "the main problem is the determination of the shape of the screening cloud .",
    "we have found this shape , as well as an integral formula for the scalar field forming the cloud .",
    "these results are used in order to derive the exact formula for the force between the two identical charges .",
    "the force completely vanishes when the distance between the charges exceeds certain critical value ( equal to @xmath10 , see formula ( 4 ) below ) that non - analytically depends on the strength @xmath11 of the charges and the self - coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we establish the presence of the total screening in the case of two identical charges in two spatial dimensions .",
    "we find the exact shape of the screening cloud formed by the scalar field , and we obtain the integral formula for the field .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the calculation of the force between the charges .",
    "section 4 contains a summary and remarks .",
    "let us begin from the simple case of a single point - like charge of strength @xmath13 located at the origin in the two dimensional space .",
    "the field equation for the static field has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two dimensional laplacian .",
    "the fundamental solution of the linear poisson equation @xmath16 has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant . we expect that close to the charge the solution @xmath0 is well approximated by @xmath19 , and therefore it is positive",
    ". then the term @xmath20 in ( 1 ) has the constant value @xmath12 , and the exact solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) has the form @xmath21 here @xmath22 is another constant . because it can be included into the constant @xmath18 , we put @xmath23 .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is determined from the requirement that our @xmath24 matches the vacuum solution @xmath25 at a certain radius @xmath26 .",
    "the matching conditions have the standard form , @xmath27 on the circle @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "the final form of solution ( 2 ) reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 the field @xmath0 given by formula ( 3 ) has positive values in the circle @xmath33 , hence the assumption that @xmath34 is fulfilled . to summarize",
    ", the scalar field in the presence of the single charge has the form @xmath35    the field @xmath36 is quite interesting for the following reasons .",
    "first , note that its dependence on the coupling constant @xmath12 , as well as on the charge @xmath11 , is nonanalytic at @xmath37 .",
    "thus the solution is non perturbative in these parameters .",
    "second , the charge @xmath11 is completely screened by the circular cloud of the field , because outside the circle @xmath38 the field attains the vacuum value @xmath25 exactly .",
    "the cloud has the constant charge density @xmath39 of the opposite sign than @xmath11 .",
    "formula ( 4 ) for the radius @xmath40 is equivalent to the statement that the total absolute charge of the circular cloud is equal to @xmath11 , namely @xmath41",
    ".    now let us turn to less trivial case of two identical point charges of strengths @xmath11 located at the points @xmath42 on the @xmath43 axis in the two dimensional space .",
    "the distance between charges is given by @xmath44 . instead of eq .",
    "( 1 ) we now have @xmath45 because of the nonlinear @xmath46 term , the pertinent solution of this equation is not just the sum of appropriately shifted in space solutions ( 3 ) , unless the distance @xmath47 between the charges exceeds @xmath48 , in which case the two circular screening clouds surrounding the charges do not intersect each other . if the charges are close to each other , i.e. , @xmath49 , it is not clear whether the total screening is still present , and if present , what is the shape of the screening cloud of the field .",
    "we address these questions in the remaining part of this section .",
    "our findings are utilized in the next section , where we calculate the force exerted on the charge located at @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath51 we again have a single point charge , screened by the circular cloud of the field as discussed above , except that now the strength of the charge equals @xmath52 instead @xmath11 .",
    "let us assume for a moment that the total screening persists also when @xmath53 , that is that there exists a region @xmath54 surrounding the two charges such that @xmath55 for points @xmath56 lying outside @xmath54 , or on the boundary @xmath57 , and that @xmath58 if @xmath56 lies inside @xmath54 . inside @xmath54 , the term @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) provides the constant charge density that screens the two point charges .",
    "this cloud of charge contributes to @xmath60 the term @xmath61 the two point charges contribute @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is the solution of ( 5 ) when @xmath64 .",
    "the shape of the region @xmath54 can be found from the requirement that we have the total screening , i.e. , @xmath65 for all points @xmath56 outside @xmath54 .    as already noticed , eq .",
    "( 5 ) is similar to poisson equation of ordinary electrostatics .",
    "standard reasoning known from the electrostatics gives the boundary conditions for @xmath0 at @xmath57 : @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the derivative in the direction perpendicular to @xmath57 .",
    "these conditions are checked numerically after we determine the region @xmath54 .    the condition ( 8) is utilized as follows .",
    "first , we rewrite the formulas for @xmath69 using the rescaled polar coordinates , introduced as follows : @xmath70 in particular , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the considered set of two point charges is symmetric with respect to reflections in the both axises , as well as in the origin .",
    "we expect that the shape of @xmath54 reflects these symmetries .",
