    "the presence of dust grains in the diffuse intergalactic medium is still an open question .",
    "if they exist , they should have great impacts not only on our understanding of galaxy evolution but also on interpretation of high - redshift observational data",
    ". from x - ray measurements of heavy metal lines , it is evident that clusters and groups of galaxies contain a significant amount of elements processed in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "such elements are likely to have been expelled out of galaxies through ram pressure stripping , galaxy mergers and interactions , blowout by supernovae , etc .",
    "dust may also be expelled by these processes or by some independent mechanism such as radiation pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emitting hot gas can collisionally heat the dust @xcite , while it can also destroy small dust grains via sputtering @xcite .",
    "dust grains coexistent with the x - ray emitting gas have indeed been detected in a number of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the temperature , the amount , and the size distribution of the dust in hot plasma can be quite different from those in the normal interstellar medium ( see dwek & arendt 1992 for review on dust  gas interactions ) .",
    "once detected firmly , the intracluster or intragroup dust will definitely provide a powerful probe of galaxy evolution and the dust  gas interaction .",
    "there have been several suggestions and debates regarding the presence of dust in clusters and groups of galaxies . over five decades ago",
    ", @xcite first suggested an enhanced extinction toward the coma cluster of galaxies .",
    "more recently , @xcite pointed out that the redshift asymmetries of member galaxies in nearby groups are consistent with the presence of dust in the intragroup medium .",
    "the observed oxygen k edge in an x - ray spectrum of the perseus cluster can also be attributed to intracluster dust grains @xcite .",
    "the extended submillimeter emission detected in a rich galaxy cluster may partly be due to dust @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive searches for the enhanced visual extinction toward high redshift objects behind clusters @xcite and @xcite reported the detection of reddening toward @xmath5 clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the intracluster dust is likely to enhance the efficiency of gas cooling @xcite that is in apparent contradiction with recent x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "more direct evidence has been searched for in the far - infrared bands .",
    "@xcite reported that the far - infrared emission observed with _",
    "iras _ is enhanced by about a factor of 2 in compact groups of galaxies compared with a sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "the extended excess emission is also inferred toward abell 262 and abell 2670 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , pointed out that the results of @xcite are likely to have been overestimated mainly due to the limited spatial resolution of _",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the detection of extended excess far - infrared emission from the coma cluster , which can be attributed to thermal emission from the intracluster dust .",
    "they find such emission only in one out of six clusters they observed with _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_. @xcite combined the _",
    "iras _ maps toward 11,507 galaxy clusters and statistically detected the excess emission , although the contribution of member galaxies is yet to be fully removed .",
    "major difficulties in the previous infrared searches are the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of the detectors . these limitations may have led to significant contamination of individual galaxies as well as galactic cirrus confusion .",
    "it will therefore be meaningful to perform infrared observations using current facilities with much improved sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "@xcite searched for the intracluster dust emission from abell 2029 with _",
    "spitzer _ and reported that the cirrus noise limits the detection of the intracluster dust component .    in this paper , we present the results of our deep observations toward the central region of the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "coma lies at high galactic latitude ( @xmath6 ) where the cirrus level is expected to be among the lowest .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite found with _",
    "iso _ the excess far - infrared emission toward coma based on the brightness ratio @xmath7 , while the s / n at each wavelength is still insufficient to detect the excess directly and the contamination of galaxies is not removed .",
    "we attempt to probe the excess emission more directly by approaching the confusion limits of extragalactic sources and galactic cirrus in each band .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a standard set of cosmological parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 consistent with the _ wmap _ five year data @xcite .",
    "an angular size of 1@xmath11 corresponds to a physical size of 0.46 kpc at the redshift @xmath12 of the coma cluster .",
    "the central region of the coma cluster was observed at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m with the mips in our go3 program on 2007 january 19 .",
    "total duration of the observation was 41 ksec .",
    "linear scans were performed in a slow scan mode covering the @xmath13 region across the cluster as shown in figure [ fig : pspc ] ( the scan width was reduced to @xmath14 at 70 @xmath0 m due to dead pixels ) .",
    "the scan paths were carefully chosen so as to avoid bright galaxies and to lie close to the cluster center ; the scan center was fixed at the mid - point ( @xmath15 ) between two massive central galaxies , ngc4874 and ngc4889 with the position angles of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the above scan center is @xmath19 northeast of the x - ray center of the cluster in the _ rosat _ pspc image ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this separation is small compared to the extent of the x - ray emission , which is characterized by the core radius of @xmath21 . in total , 32 scans were performed in each band , 16 of which repeatedly covered a @xmath22 region on either side of the scan center .",
    "the integration time per pixel after 16 scans was 1600 , 1600 and 160 sec at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "two sets of the 16 scan legs overlapped and the integration time was doubled in the central @xmath23 region , where the x - ray emission is the most prominent .",
    "the data were first processed with the mips pipeline , version s17 @xcite to yield the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) . to further improve the images ,",
    "the pixel - dependent and scan - dependent backgrounds were corrected as follows . in doing so",
    ", special care was taken to maintain the extended nonlinear component of the emission .",
    "all the results regarding the extended emission are based on unfiltered images .",
    "first , we create a median flat field of detector pixels by stacking the normalized bcd frames , excluding the regions within @xmath21 from the cluster center .",
    "the normalization is done by dividing each bcd by its median .",
    "this is intended to separate any large - scale variations , e.g. , due to the zodiacal light , from the pixel - dependent backgrounds and applied solely to create the flat field .",
    "we have checked that the flat field so obtained is properly normalized ; its mean is equal to unity within 0.2% .",
    "we then divide the original bcd ( not normalized ) by the normalized median flat field . at 24 @xmath0 m",
    ", we further remove scattered light that produces a background modulation as a function of the scan mirror position ; the average offset at each scan mirror position is computed excluding the data within @xmath21 from the cluster center . as mentioned below , these processes will be re - run after the source identification .",
    "second , we create for each band a mosaic image using the mopex software package , version 18.2 @xcite developed at the spitzer science center .",
    "the pixel size is taken to be a nominal value of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "we exclude the first five bcd frames in each scan leg to omit boost frame transients .",
    "we also exclude the frames affected by stimulator flashes at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "the background matching is applied _ after _ combining the frames in each scan leg ; we only correct the constant offsets among 32 scan legs to assure sufficiently large overlapping area and to preserve any extended feature of the emission .",
    "third , we identify point sources in the mosaic images down to the 1@xmath1 detection limit ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 mjy at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively ) using apex @xcite .",
    "this limit corresponds to the @xmath30 confusion level in each band @xcite .",
    "the regions around the sources are masked out and unused in our analysis .",
    "more specifically , the source identification and the masking procedure are done on the basis of median - subtracted images ; a median - filtered image is created and subtracted from the unfiltered image solely for this purpose . to improve the efficiency of source detection against unknown background fluctuations , we vary the size of a median filter box from @xmath31 to @xmath32 pixels . for every source identified in each median - subtracted image , we estimate the radius @xmath33 at which the surface brightness , including that of the side - lobes , drops below a certain threshold noise level using the point response function .",
    "we adopt 0.5@xmath1 as the threshold noise level at 24 and 70@xmath0 m , and 1@xmath1 at 160 @xmath0 m , considering the lower uniformity of the data in the latter band .",
    "we then return to the _ unfiltered _ image and mask all the pixels within @xmath33 from the sources identified in any of the median - subtracted images .",
    "we have checked that the correlation coefficient between the mean brightness of masked pixels ( @xmath34 ) and that of unmasked pixels at @xmath35 is less than 0.2 in any of the median - subtracted images .",
    "we thus consider that our masking procedure successfully removes the contribution of resolved sources",
    ".    strictly speaking , the source identification and the background correction are not independent of each other . we therefore repeat the above procedure from the flat - field correction excluding the pixels around the point sources in the bcd .",
    "after applying the above corrections , we subtract from each unfiltered image the linear gradient over the entire map , so as to remove the variation on scales larger than the galaxy cluster .",
    "such a gradient is greatest at 24 @xmath0 m due to the zodiacal light ; it causes the difference of @xmath36 mjy / sr between the map edges which is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the average noise level of the image ( table [ tab : images ] ) . by simply subtracting the linear component",
    ", we avoid relying on specific models of the zodiacal light emission that are still uncertain at scales probed here . to preserve the average brightness of the entire map ,",
    "the brightness at the scan center is kept unchanged by the subtraction .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] shows the mosaic images after the subtraction of the linear gradient .",
    "the point sources are explicitly shown for display purposes .",
    "the pixel sizes of the images , the fwhms of the point response function , and the average noise levels are listed in table [ tab : images ] .",
    "we have assigned a noise to an individual pixel as the larger of the uncertainty estimated in the mips pipeline and the standard deviation of actual measurements at that pixel .",
    "the latter is on average twice as large as the former at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , and both are comparable at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "this choice should enable us to take account of any residual systematics in each pixel more properly .",
    "note that the sensitivity at 160 @xmath0 m is likely limited by galactic cirrus ; the @xmath37 fluctuation level expected at the position of coma is @xmath38 mjy / sr at 70 @xmath0 m and 0.20 mjy / sr at 160 @xmath0 m @xcite .    masking the regions around the detected sources removes 38% , 66% and 64% of the pixels in the 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m images , respectively .",
    "we plot the histograms of the pixels with and without masking in figure [ fig : hist ] . in all bands , the histograms before masking are positively skewed due to bright sources . once the sources are excluded , the data follow the gaussian distribution more closely , while there are small excesses at high @xmath1 .",
    "these excesses are due to low - significance data affected by noisy detector arrays or low coverage .",
    "since the noise assigned to such data is large , their contribution to the mean brightness is negligible . at 160 @xmath0 m ,",
    "the 1@xmath1 range of the distribution after the source mask , 0.19 mjy / sr , is likely affected by the fluctuations of galactic cirrus emission @xcite . at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m , the 1@xmath1 ranges , @xmath39 and @xmath40 mjy , are comparable to the average noise level listed in table [ tab : images ] .    figures [ fig : prof1][fig : prof3 ] show the surface brightness distribution along the scan path as a function of the distance from the x - ray center of the cluster ( negative values of the distance are assigned to the pixels at lower declination than the x - ray center ) .",
    "we plot the brightness at each pixel and their binned average .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the error bar indicates the 1@xmath1 statistical error of the mean in each bin .",
    "the 70 @xmath0 m data are lacking within @xmath41 from the x - ray center due to dead pixels .",
    "we hence adopt fiducially the bin size of @xmath42 ( 100 kpc ) in the present paper so that it fully covers the deficit region while it is still sufficiently smaller than the x - ray core radius of @xmath21 . in all bands , the fluctuations in the brightness ,",
    "particularly the spikes due to point sources , are significantly reduced after the source mask , yet there is no indication of the central excess .    in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : prof1][fig : prof3 ] , we plot the mean brightness of the removed component , i.e. , the difference between the unmasked and masked brightness . from our linear scans within @xmath43 from the cluster center , we do not find a central concentration of the integrated source intensities either .",
    "the average levels of the removed brightness are @xmath44 mjy / sr , @xmath45 mjy / sr and 0.16 mjy / sr at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "we further combine the brightness in the two directions from the cluster center and compare its radial profile with model predictions in figure [ fig : prof_abs ] .",
    "the prediction for the intracluster dust emission is based on the theoretical model of @xcite ( see the next section for details ) . for direct comparison with the _ iso _ results ,",
    "we have adjusted the total amount of dust to reproduce the excess brightness of 0.2 mjy / sr at 120 @xmath0 m within the radius of @xmath46 inferred in @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in the difference of the signal across the cluster , an offset is added to the model brightness to match the mean brightness of the whole map at the edge . at 24 @xmath0 m ,",
    "the absence of the excess is as expected since the predicted temperature of the intracluster dust is relatively low , @xmath47k ( see also dwek et al .",
    "1990 ) . at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , the foreground / background fluctuations are comparable to the expected levels of the emission and we do not find a sign of the central excess in either band .    from the observed brightness within @xmath48 relative to the mean of the entire map ,",
    "we obtain 2@xmath1 upper limits on the central excess as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 mjy / sr , at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively . in deriving these limits ,",
    "we have taken into account the background / foreground fluctuations that dominate over the statistical noise as follows .",
    "we have randomly selected a circular region of radius @xmath42 from the map in each band 100 times . from the variance of the mean brightness of selected regions ,",
    "we have assigned an @xmath37 error of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 mjy / sr at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found with _",
    "iso _ the excess far - infrared emission toward the center of this cluster based on the surface brightness ratio @xmath7 .",
    "although the scan paths and the observed bands are not exactly the same in our observations , we attempt to mimic their analysis by presenting @xmath55 and @xmath56 in figure [ fig : rat ] . while the fluctuation is large , there appears to be a weak sign of a central enhancement in @xmath56 .",
    "the enhancement is largely due to a variation in the 160 @xmath0 m map around the cluster center ( fig.[fig : images ] ) ; there are bright extended regions at @xmath57 on each side , presumably produced by far - infrared sources lying on fluctuating cirrus foreground .",
    "we have checked that no counterparts are detected in the _ chandra _ x - ray image of this region . while some of the sources are apparent and removed at 70 @xmath0 m , the lower spatial resolution and the larger cirrus fluctuation prevent us from removing them completely at 160 @xmath0 m . in turn",
    ", the cluster center appears to be darker than its surrounding at 160 @xmath0 m , resulting in the apparent excess in @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig : prof3 ] also indicates that the depression at 160 @xmath0 m is not due to over - removal of the sources at the center .",
    "we therefore do not consider this to be a detection of the intracluster dust .",
    "while there is no direct evidence of the central excess in any of the three bands observed by the mips , we still find a weak sign of excess in the brightness ratio @xmath56 that may resemble the excess in @xmath7 reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to explore the consistency of these results .    for this purpose ,",
    "we subtract from our data the average zodiacal light and the cosmic infrared background levels estimated by the _ spitzer _",
    "background estimator @xcite at the scan center position for the date of observation ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 mjy / sr , @xmath60 and @xmath61 mjy / sr at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "we subtract the above values from the whole map since we have already corrected the linear gradient of the map relative to the scan center .",
    "we have checked that subtracting position - dependent zodiacal light levels prior to the correction of the linear gradient changes the resulting brightness ratio by no more than 5% .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute calibration are not significant either ; @xmath62 at 70 @xmath0 m and @xmath63 at 160 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "however , simply because the mid - infrared brightness is dominated by the zodiacal light , the nominal error of @xmath64 in its model @xcite will change the brightness after subtraction at 70 and 160@xmath0 m , @xmath65 mjy / sr and @xmath66 mjy / sr , by @xmath67% and @xmath68% , respectively . keeping these large uncertainties in mind ,",
    "we investigate the origin of the excess in the band ratio as follows .    figure [ fig : rat_abs ] shows the radial distribution of the brightness ratio @xmath69 after the correction mentioned above .",
    "the error bars include only the statistical uncertainties .",
    "assuming that the corrected brightness distribution is produced by a combination of a central excess and more extended component , e.g. , galactic cirrus , we apply equation ( 7 ) of @xcite to our observed bands and obtain @xmath70 mjy / sr within the radius of @xmath42 .",
    "this value is comparable to the 2@xmath1 upper limit of @xmath71 mjy / sr derived solely from the 70 @xmath0 m data in the previous section .",
    "the central excess , if real , should have been nearly canceled at 70 @xmath0 m by the fluctuation of the other component .",
    "the interpretation of the central excess for the origin of the observed @xmath56 profile is therefore rather unlikely , although it is not fully rejected .",
    "note that equation ( 7 ) of @xcite is based on a key assumption that the excess component contributes only to the variation of the shorter wavelength data .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible to interpret the same data with the variation of the longer wavelength data . in the present observation",
    ", a plausible explanation may be that the corrected brightness is still dominated by unresolved sources lying on the fluctuating cirrus foreground , i.e. , the absolute values of the signal in both bands are dominated by such sources while the fluctuations at 160 @xmath0 m are mainly produced by underlying cirrus emission .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath72 shown in figure [ fig : rat_abs ] corresponds to the dust temperature of @xmath73 k for the absorption efficiency of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this temperature is higher than the nominal temperature of galactic cirrus @xmath75 k for which the brightness ratio is lower by more than a factor of 5 .",
    "the mean values of @xmath76 mjy / sr and @xmath77 mjy / sr are also higher than the levels of the cirrus emission expected for this region , suggesting the contribution of yet unresolved components .    from the limits on the infrared brightness in each band , we further attempt to derive constraints on the amount of the intracluster dust .",
    "model predictions shown in figure [ fig : prof_abs ] @xcite rely on an assumption that the dust is supplied continuously to the intracluster medium from galaxies with the initial size distribution similar to our galaxy , @xmath78 @xcite , and has reached a steady state against sputtering with the size distribution @xmath79 .",
    "the galaxy distribution is assumed to trace that of the dark matter given by the navarro ",
    "frenk white density profile @xcite , and the gas density follows the isothermal beta model .",
    "given these , the curves plotted in figure [ fig : prof_abs ] correspond to the dust surface density of @xmath80 m@xmath81 kpc@xmath82 within the central @xmath42 of the cluster .",
    "the 2@xmath1 upper limits on the excess brightness derived in the previous section are 1.3 and 0.37 times the model brightness averaged within the central @xmath42 at @xmath83 m and @xmath84 m , respectively . considering much lower uniformity of the data at 160 @xmath0 m , we take the limit of the @xmath83 m data to obtain @xmath85 m@xmath81 kpc@xmath82 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the dust - to - gas - mass ratio of less than @xmath86 within the central 100 kpc , which is nearly 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the galactic value @xcite .",
    "the average visual extinction @xmath87 is related to the dust surface density as @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the extinction efficiency factor , @xmath90 is the dust mass density , and @xmath91 is the grain radius . adopting the standard values for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 quoted in the above equation , our derived limit of @xmath92 m@xmath81 kpc@xmath82 corresponds to @xmath93 within the central 100 kpc . on the other hand , @xcite report",
    "the detection of the mean @xmath94 of a few times @xmath95 mag toward sdss qsos behind @xmath96 clusters , and @xcite obtain the limit @xmath97 ( 2@xmath1 ) from reddening of @xmath98 background galaxies for 458 clusters .",
    "while these optical measurements are given for much larger ( @xmath99 mpc ) scales , our result is still consistent with them .",
    "finally , gravitational lensing can impact on the emission of background sources behind galaxy clusters .",
    "as the total surface brightness is conserved by lensing , the bias in the resolved or unresolved brightness is caused solely by the sources that exceed the detection limit as a result of magnification @xcite .",
    "the number of such sources is @xmath100 times the number of unlensed sources already lying above the flux limit @xmath101 , where @xmath0 is the magnification and @xmath102 is the index of the unlensed source count , @xmath103 .",
    "the fractional change in the resolved brightness has the same sign as and is less than @xmath104 , because the sources contributing to the change have the lowest flux among those resolved .",
    "note that the factor @xmath104 is different from the bias in the overall surface density given by @xmath105 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent surveys with _ spitzer _ yield the mean values of @xmath106 down to 35 @xmath0jy at 24 @xmath0 m @xcite and @xmath107 down to 1.2 mjy at 70 @xmath0 m @xcite",
    ". the depths of these measurements are comparable to those of the present observation . at 160 @xmath0 m ,",
    "the published counts are currently available for @xmath108 mjy , and an extrapolation using the model of @xcite yields @xmath109 at @xmath110 mjy @xcite . in the case of coma ,",
    "the einstein radius is @xmath111 and the magnification is expected to vary from @xmath112 at @xmath48 to @xmath113 at @xmath114 for a singular isothermal mass profile . taken together , the above factor in this radius range varies from @xmath115 to @xmath116 at 24 @xmath0 m and 70 @xmath0 m , and @xmath117 to @xmath118 at 160 @xmath0 m . the fractional change in the brightness of the _ removed component _ shown in figures 46 should therefore be smaller than the variations along the scan path .",
    "there is in fact no sign of systematic increase in the resolved brightness toward the cluster center in any band .",
    "owing to the conservation of the total brightness , the bias in the residual unresolved background should also be small .",
    "we hence consider that the impact of gravitational lensing is negligible in the present results .",
    "in this paper , we have undertaken a search for the infrared emission from the intracluster dust in the coma cluster of galaxies by the mips on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "our observations yield the deepest mid and far - infrared images of a galaxy cluster ever achieved with average 1@xmath1 sensitivities per pixel of @xmath119 mjy / sr , @xmath120 mjy / sr and @xmath121 mjy / sr at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "in each of the three bands , we have not detected a signature of the central excess component .",
    "our observations yield the 2@xmath1 upper limits on the excess emission within @xmath42 ( 100 kpc ) of the cluster center as @xmath49 mjy / sr , @xmath122 mjy / sr , and @xmath54 mjy / sr , at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with the values reported by @xcite for abell 2029 , as well as those derived from a stacking analysis of 11,507 clusters @xcite .    with the improved spatial resolution and sensitivity of the mips ,",
    "we have obtained much more robust limits on the excess emission from this cluster than previous observations .",
    "we still find that the brightness ratio between 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m shows a marginal sign of the central excess , in qualitative agreement with the finding of @xcite and @xcite by _",
    "iso_. although we can not fully reject the contribution of the intracluster dust , it is more likely due to unresolved infrared sources lying on fluctuating cirrus foreground .",
    "combined with the theoretical model of @xcite , we have derived a limit on the surface mass density of the intracluster dust as @xmath92 m@xmath81 kpc@xmath82 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the dust - to - gas - mass ratio of less than @xmath123 within the central 100 kpc , which is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the galactic value , implying that the dust destruction is very efficient at the center of the cluster .",
    "our result can further be converted to the limit on the visual extinction of @xmath124 , which is consistent with the results derived from statistical reddening of background objects behind a large sample of galaxy clusters @xcite .",

    "<S> our observations yield the 2@xmath1 upper limits on the excess emission within 100 kpc of the cluster center as @xmath2 mjy / sr , @xmath3 mjy / sr , and @xmath4 mjy / sr , at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are in agreement with those found in other galaxy clusters and suggest that dust is deficient near the cluster center by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the interstellar medium . </S>"
