    "fflo state emerges with mismatched fermi surface of imbalanced fermi gas .",
    "therefore , it has been viewed as one of the most interesting superconduction phases , and is studied in various field , ranging from heavy fermions @xcite , organic superconductor org1 to ultra - cold atomic gases @xcite . however , due to the small pairing phase space in 2d and 3d , only phase separation is observed in experiments rather than fflo state .",
