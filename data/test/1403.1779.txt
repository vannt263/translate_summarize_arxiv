    "since the discovery that quantum coherences might have a functional role in biological systems even at room temperature  @xcite , there has been great interest in understanding how coherences can be maintained and used under the influence of different environments with competing effects .",
    "in particular , much of recent research focused on one - dimensional nanostructures , due to their relevance to molecular aggregates , such as the j - aggregates  @xcite , natural photosynthetic systems  @xcite , bio - engineered devices for photon sensing  @xcite and light - harvesting systems  @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on a ring - like structure of two - level systems coupled with nearest neighbor tunneling amplitudes which has been recently considered in literature  @xcite .",
    "usually , under low light intensity , in many natural photosynthetic systems or in ultra - precise photon sensors the single - excitation approximation can be used . in this case",
    "the system is equivalent to a tight binding model where one excitation can hop from site to site , see fig .",
    "[ ring ] .",
    "many photosynthetic organisms contain ring - like chlorophyll molecular aggregates in their light - harvesting complexes , which are called lhi and lhii  @xcite .",
    "these complexes have the purpose to absorb light and to transfer the excitations to other structures or to a central core absorber , the reaction center , where charge separation , necessary in the next steps of photosynthesis , occurs .",
    "these complexes are subject to the effects of different environments : @xmath0 dissipative , where the excitation can be lost ; @xmath1 proteic , which induces static or dynamical disorder .",
    "the efficiency of excitation transfer can be determined only through a comprehensive analysis of the effects due to the interplay of all those environments .    here ,",
    "in particular , we consider a system subject to the influence of both a common decay channel where the excitation can be lost , and a static disorder .",
    "the first environment can be thought of as a model for the coupling of a molecular aggregate to the electromagnetic field  @xcite ( loss of excitation by recombination ) or for the coupling of the molecular aggregate to a central core absorber ( loss of excitation by trapping ) . for many molecular aggregates ,",
    "the single channel approximation is appropriate to describe the coupling with the electromagnetic field , since the wavelength of the absorbed light is much larger than the system size ( natural complexes such as lhi , lhii typically span few tens of nanometers , while the wavelength of the involved photon is hundreds of nanometers ) .",
    "moreover , it can also be considered as a good approximation for the coupling to a central core absorber , modeled for instance by a semi - infinite one - dimensional lead  @xcite .",
    "the second environment consists of a protein scaffold , in which photosynthetic complexes are embedded , that induces fluctuations in the sites energies .",
    "the fluctuations which occur on a time scale much larger than the time scale of the dynamics are usually described as static disorder . by static disorder",
    "we mean position dependent , but time - independent , fluctuations of the site energies .",
    "the case of time - dependent fluctuations of site energies has been considered in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , when many sites are all coupled to the same channel , we can have a superradiant behavior  @xcite .",
    "superradiance implies the existence of some states with a cooperatively enhanced decay rate ( i.e.  proportional to the number of sites ) .",
    "superradiance comes always together with subradiance , that is the existence of states with a cooperatively suppressed decay rate ( i.e.  smaller than the single - site decay rate ) .",
    "though originally discovered in the context of atomic clouds interacting with the electromagnetic field  @xcite , in presence of many excitations , superradiance was soon recognized to be a general phenomenon in open quantum systems  @xcite under the conditions of coherent coupling with a common decay channel .",
    "most importantly , it can also occur in presence of a single excitation ( the super of superradiance  @xcite ) , entailing a purely quantum effect .",
    "the functional role that superradiance might have in natural photosynthetic systems has been discussed in many publications  @xcite , and experimentally observed in molecular aggregates  @xcite .",
    "superradiance ( or supertransfer ) is also thought to play an important role w.r.t .  the transfer of excitation to the central core absorber  @xcite , and its effects on the efficiency of energy transport in photosynthetic molecular aggregates have been recently analyzed  @xcite .",
    "the origin of superradiance lies in the fact that the excitation can be coherently spread over several sites , thus inducing a cooperative effect . on the other hand ,",
    "static disorder is expected to destroy superradiance , since it induces localization  @xcite , which implies that excitons are localized on one site only , thus hindering cooperativity .",
    "the main question we want to address here is whether a critical disorder exists at which superradiance and , thus , cooperativity are destroyed .",
    "the relation between superradiance and localization have been already analyzed in literature in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite the case of weak coupling to the continuum ( weak opening ) has been analyzed for one - dimensional systems .",
    "it has been already analyzed also by some of the authors of the present paper : in  @xcite the case of open 1-d and 3-d anderson models in the strong opening regime was considered .",
    "it was pointed out there that the sensitivity to disorder can be very different for superradiant and subradiant states : while the latter localize at the same critical disorder of the closed system ( i.e.  a system with no coupling to the continuum of states ) , the former localize at the critical disorder for which superradiance is quenched .",
    "interestingly , though subradiant states essentially localize at the localization threshold associated with the closed system , they display some peculiar features due to opening , being neither fully localized nor extended ( hybrid states )  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we aim to study both the regimes of weak and strong opening and their effects on localization in one - dimensional nanostructures .    even if it is easy to imagine that opening and disorder have competing effects on the efficiency of energy absorption and transfer , a deeper analysis is necessary to fully understand their action .",
    "for instance , disorder decreases the efficiency of the superradiant states in absorbing light or in transferring excitations , but , at the same time , it can allow for energy absorption and transfer from the subradiant states .",
    "thus , for these states , disorder is useful to enhance efficiency .",
    "the latter effect is strongly related to the enhancement of efficiency due to noise : the so called noise - assisted transport , discussed in  @xcite .",
    "noise - assisted transport constitutes a general phenomenon in quantum networks , even if its relation with subradiance has never been stressed up to now , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we introduce the model , in sec .",

    "this situation of `` coherent dissipation '' can be met in many systems and it has been recently considered in  @xcite , where it has been shown to give rise to the following effective non - hermitian hamiltonian ( see also  @xcite ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the transition amplitudes from the discrete state @xmath22 to the continuum channel @xmath23 . in our case",

    "will be given in @xmath32 and in order to have time in @xmath37 we need to divide it by @xmath38 .",
    "due to its specific structure , the operator @xmath39 has only one eigenstate with a non - zero eigenvalue : this is the fully extended state with eigenvalue equal to @xmath40 .",

    "this implies that only the state @xmath44 , eq .  ( [ sr ] ) , has a non - vanishing decay width equal to the total decay width of the system : @xmath45 .",

    "note that the dependence on @xmath40 of that decay width is the hallmark of the cooperative nature of superradiance .",
    "all the other states with zero decay width are called subradiant . the full expression for the complex eigenstates of the non - hermitian hamiltonian , eq.([amef ] ) , is given in appendix @xmath46 , see eq.([ceig ] ) .",
    "importantly , the superradiant effect might explain the strong dependence on the initial state of the efficiency of energy transfer to a central core absorber discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several features of the model above in absence of disorder are quite atypical .",
    "indeed , superradiance , as discussed in many papers  @xcite , is usually reached only above a critical coupling strength with the continuum ( in the overlapping resonance regime ) when @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average decay width and @xmath49 is the mean level spacing of the closed system . on the other hand ,",

    "note that such geometrically - induced subradiant subspaces with zero decay width are equivalent to the trapping - free subspaces discussed in literature  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us notice that the presence of a superradiant regime for any coupling strength to the continuum might indicate a relation between structure and function in natural complexes , and it might also suggest the use of ring - like structures to exploit the superradiant behavior .",

    "we compute the survival probability @xmath136 , for one realization of disorder . by changing the random initial state and the random diagonal disorder , we can consider the average survival probability @xmath162 and define the decay time @xmath163 as @xmath164 these @xmath165 values are reported in fig .",

    "we show , in the same figure , the analytical expression for the average decay width of the subradiant states , see eq .",
    "( [ wcr ] ) .",
    "as one can see , up to a numerical constant , the agreement is very good .",
    "in other words , the disorder strength necessary to quench superradiance ( obtained analytically imposing the average decay width of the subradiant states , @xmath60 , to be equal to the single site decay @xmath3 ) is also a valid tool in estimating the decay time of the survival probability associated with generic random initial conditions .",
    "the problem of computing the survival probability of the superradiant state in presence of inhomogeneous broadening was also considered in  @xcite for @xmath40 two - level systems .",
    "a bi - exponential behavior was numerically found for any excitation number .",
    "for the case where only one excitation is present , our results are compatible with the bi - exponential behaviour of the survival probability found in  @xcite , and we also give an approximate analytical expression for the survival probability @xmath136 .    finally , in order to stress the relevance of superradiant energy transfer in natural photosynthetic complexes , let us consider the excitation transfer from the lhi complex to the reaction center  @xcite .",
    "first of all , we point out that all models used to study the dynamics of this complex are characterized by a large inhomogeneity in the transfer time of different energy eigenstates  @xcite , which is , for instance , typical of the superradiant regime .",
    "thus , we reasonably assume superradiance in transfer to be relevant in natural complexes . we can estimate @xmath3 , representing the coupling to the reaction center , from the following considerations . using realistic parameters as was done at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , @xmath85 , @xmath166 , we computed @xmath136 for the fully extended state of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) , in presence of a realistic value of the static disorder @xmath167 ( a large disorder corresponding to the critical disorder at which superradiance starts to be quenched ) .",
    "we choose @xmath168 , so that we have a transfer time ( time at which @xmath169 ) starting from the fully extended state of @xmath170 , in agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "note that a single occupied site would give a transfer time of @xmath171 , showing that , even in presence of strong and realistic static disorder , superradiance is able to strongly enhance energy transfer .",
    "we analyzed the interplay of superradiance , induced by the coupling to a common decay channel , and localization , induced by static disorder , in 1-d ring - like structures , usually used to model some natural light - harvesting complexes .",
    "the common decay channel can represent both the coupling to the electromagnetic field or to a central core absorber , such as the reaction center in natural photosynthetic complexes .",
    "we have shown that , for zero disorder , these structures are in a superradiant regime for any value of the coupling strength to a common decay channel . above a critical disorder strength superradiant effects decrease until , for very large disorder , all of the states decay independently with the common width @xmath3 , and cooperativity is completely lost .",
    "our main purpose was to determine the critical disorder at which superradiance is hindered . using a perturbative approach we determined analytically such critical disorder and we related it firstly with the localization properties of superradiant and subradiant states and then to the system dynamics .",
    "we found that superradiance can be quenched by disorder in different ways , depending on the regime entailing either weak or strong coupling to the continuum .",
    "these regimes are triggered by the parameter @xmath172 , which represents the ratio between the coupling strength to the continuum , @xmath3 , and the unperturbed mean level spacing in absence of disorder , @xmath173 .",
    "when this ratio is small , i.e.  @xmath174 , the critical disorder is independent of the coupling strength with the external environment and it is determined only by the parameters of the molecular chain , since the opening is unable to affect the disorder - induced localization . in this regime , the critical disorder decreases with the size of the system , but , for large system size @xmath175 , such a regime becomes less and less feasible ( to be in the weak opening regime implies the condition @xmath176 ) . on the other hand , for strong opening , @xmath177 , the critical disorder increases with both the size of the system and the coupling strength with the external environment",
    "this is in agreement with the results recently found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same ring structure has been analyzed in presence of dephasing ( dynamical disorder ) and the strength necessary to destroy superradiance was found to be proportional to both @xmath3 and @xmath40 .",
    "we also demonstrated that the critical disorder at which superradiance is suppressed is close to the disorder at which superradiant states localize  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we found that , in the weak opening regime , @xmath178 , superradiance is quenched at the same disorder at which the edge state of the closed system , with real energy equal to that of the superradiant state , localizes .",
    "we have also found that , in the strong opening regime , @xmath177 , superradiance is a manifestation of cooperative robustness to disorder , in that the superradiant state localizes at a disorder strength ( proportional to the system size ) much larger than the one needed to localize the corresponding edge state of the closed system . as for subradiant states , in any regime , they begin their process of localization at the same disorder strength at which the states of the closed system do .",
    "finally , we have shown the relevance of our findings to natural photosynthetic complexes : @xmath0 for the realistic parameters of natural complexes , superradiance is quenched at a disorder strength which is independent of the coupling to the external environment ( electromagnetic field or reaction center ) , which is difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "thus our findings allow to determine the critical disorder from the localization properties of the closed system alone ; @xmath1 the critical disorder thus obtained is compatible with experimental estimates , suggesting that natural systems operate close to the superradiance transition ; @xmath179 even in presence of large and realistic static disorder , superradiance can strongly enhance energy transfer to the reaction center and light absorbtion .     _",
    "_ we would like to thank r.  kaiser and b.  sterzi for providing many useful discussions .",
    "perturbation theory is applied to the _ symmetric unperturbed hamiltonian , _ @xmath180 in order to find the critical disorder strength , @xmath70 , at which superradiance is destroyed .",

    "when the disorder strength is turned on every state will get an eigenenergy with a negative imaginary part ( decay width ) .",
    "perturbation theory up to second order can be applied , for sufficiently small disorder strength , to give @xmath207 for degenerate energy levels the first order correction is given by the eigenvalues of the 2 by 2 symmetric matrices @xmath208 while the second order correction is @xmath209 we are interested in the imaginary part of the perturbed eigenvalues , and , since the eigenstates , @xmath205 , are _ real _ , first order corrections never contribute to those terms .",
