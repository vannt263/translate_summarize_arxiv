    "more than half a century ago , anderson pointed out the possibility that diffusion or conduction could be absent in an isolated quantum many - body system due to static disorder  @xcite . although this original paper did discuss an interacting system in highly - excited states , most of the subsequent work on anderson localization focused instead on either noninteracting particles ( or waves ) or on the low temperature limit .",

    "@xcite that re - ignited interest in highly - excited interacting systems with strong disorder , where they found strictly zero conductivity at non - zero temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is now called ` many - body localization ' .",
    "even highly excited states can be many - body localized .",
    "recently , many - body localization has attracted much attention , for it allows new types of quantum phase transitions in highly - excited states  @xcite and is able to protect certain forms of topological order  @xcite .",
    "while there is no dc transport of local observables in a many - body localized system @xcite , it has been observed that entanglement can still spread over the entire system , with the size of entangled regions growing with time @xmath3 as @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "several authors have examined this logarithmic dependence , showing that it is a consequence of dephasing due to the interactions  @xcite .",

    "@xcite reports that entanglement entropy can grow faster in the presence of long - range interactions . here",
    "we restrict our consideration to only short - range interactions .",
    "in particular , ref .  @xcite introduces a phenomenology of many - body localization of ( short - range ) interacting spins , which naturally explains that the bipartite entanglement @xmath5 of a one - dimensional many - body localized system initialized in a pure product state grows as @xmath6 where @xmath0 is a localization length ( defined below ) which primarily depends on the interaction and disorder strengths , and @xmath7 is the final value of entanglement per spin  @xcite , which can strongly depend on the initial state .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the spreading of entanglement in detail by using exact diagonalization of the random - field xxz hamiltonian . varying the disorder strength and initial conditions ,",
    "we study how the spreading rate changes and thereby find support for eq .",
    "( [ entanglement ] ) .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the phenomenology of ref .",
    "@xcite , which should be consulted for further details .",
    "we restrict our attention to a system of n spin 1/2 s @xmath8 with a short - range interaction on some lattice , with random fields that are strong enough so that all many - body eigenstates are localized .",
    "this setup should capture much of the essence of many - body localization .",
    "calling the bare spins @xmath8 `` p - bits '' ( p = physical ) , we can construct `` dressed '' pseudospins @xmath9 , which are called `` l - bits '' ( l = localized )  @xcite .",
    "one important criterion in building l - bits is that all @xmath10 possible outer products of the @xmath11 s and single - spin identity operators must be constants of motion which commute with the system s hamiltonian @xmath12 . by this construction , each many - body eigenstate of the hamiltonian is one of the @xmath10 simultaneous eigenstates of all of the @xmath13 s .",
    "this construction is always possible  @xcite , since there are in fact @xmath14 possible ways of constructing a one - to - one mapping from each many - body eigenstate to each simultaneous eigenstate of all the @xmath15 . for a given @xmath12 and one such mapping ( which includes setting a phase for each state )",
    ", one can thus define the l - bit operators @xmath9 and expand these operators in terms of outer products of the p - bit operators @xmath8  @xcite . for certain random spin chains , the existence of such a construction of localized l - bits",
    "is proven in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a fully many - body localized system ,",
    "it is conjectured that there exists an `` optimal '' construction of the l - bits such that the l - bits are maximally localized when they are expressed in terms of the p - bits  @xcite .",
    "terms in the expansion of an l - bit that involve distant p - bits have typical weights that fall off exponentially with distance .",
    "furthermore , we can write the hamiltonian in terms of the l - bit operators as follows : @xmath16 where the typical couplings of higher - order and longer - range terms fall off exponentially .",
    "it is then evident that the l - bits @xmath15 are localized constants of motion ( a similar argument can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now consider the spreading of entanglement in a fully many - body localized system .",
    "suppose our initial state is a non - entangled pure product state of p - bits .",
    "this is a particular linear combination of eigenstates of @xmath12 , each of which has area - law entanglement  @xcite .",
    "time evolution produces area - law entanglement between nearby p - bits on a microscopic time scale . after this early - time behavior seen in refs .",
    "@xcite , the l - bit picture becomes a useful way to examine the subsequent behavior .",
    "the l - bits become entangled because the precession rate of a given l - bit is set by its interactions with all the other l - bits . for",
    "given fixed values of all of the other l - bits @xmath17 , the typical effective interaction between two l - bits separated by a distance @xmath18 falls off exponentially with @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "we use this decay to define a localization length @xmath0 .",
    "it takes roughly @xmath20 for this interaction to substantially affect the precession of these two l - bits and thus entangle them .",
    "therefore , after time @xmath3 , the bipartite entanglement across a given `` cut '' in such a localized spin chain is due to l - bits within distance @xmath21 from the cut .",
    "this explains the logarithmic growth of entanglement and the prefactor of @xmath0 , the localization length .",
    "furthermore , we expect that in a finite system the saturation time of the entanglement entropy should thus depend on @xmath0 , but be independent of the initial state provided those initial states all have the same @xmath0 , which we demonstrate later .",
    "in particular , this implies that the entanglement in two systems which possess the same localization length , but different initial conditions and therefore unequal _ final _ entanglement entropies , should saturate at the same time . therefore , the entanglement growth rate must also be proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the long - time , saturated entanglement entropy per spin for a given hamiltonian and initial state . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will examine this scenario in detail .",
    "we consider an xxz spin-1/2 chain with random longitudinal fields and open boundary conditions : @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are static random fields uniformly drawn from @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath25 is zero , then this model is mappable to noninteracting spinless fermions with static disorder and is thus single - particle anderson localized .",
    "provided that @xmath26 is large enough and @xmath27 , this model exhibits many - body localization @xcite .",
    "we set the hopping strength @xmath28 = 1 to fix the energy scale and also set @xmath29 .",
    "we set the interaction to be @xmath30 .",
    "then , we study the entanglement dynamics for a range of @xmath26 and initial conditions by exactly diagonalizing the hamiltonian for each realization of random fields  @xcite .",
    "we average over 10 000 realizations of the random fields for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , 1000 realizations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and 100 realizations for @xmath35 .",
    "we consider only even @xmath36 , since we study the bipartite entanglement across the midpoint of the chain .      to compute the time dependence of the entanglement entropy , we time - evolve the spin chain from a random initial state @xmath37 .",
    "we then partition the spin chain into two equally sized subsystems across the center bond , between the spins at sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for each time",
    "@xmath3 we compute the probability operator ( a.k.a .",
    "reduced density matrix ) of the right half of the system , by tracing over all spins in the left half , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the state of the entire spin chain .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath5 is then given by the von neumann entropy @xmath42 ; note that we measure the entropy in bits .",
    "we evaluate this quantity up to a time @xmath43 , which is long enough for the entanglement entropy to saturate for the systems considered here .",
    "the initial state of each spin is chosen randomly from one of the two red circles on the bloch sphere at a fixed height @xmath44 above or below the `` equator '' .",
    "this parametrization allows us to control how closely the initial state resembles an eigenstate of the system and therefore the amount of dephasing and maximum entanglement entropy per spin that results . ]",
    "we systematically vary the initial state of our system to investigate its effect on @xmath5 .",
    "each initial state is a random product state @xmath45 , with each spin pointing a random direction at a given height in its own bloch sphere . in other words , each initial state",
    "is an outer product of single - spin pure states @xmath46 as such , the initial entanglement entropy is zero .",
    "[ bloch ] illustrates how each single - spin state in the product state is chosen .",

    "this parametrization is chosen so that we can generate initial states with a wide range of saturation entanglement entropies per spin by varying @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , such initial states contain all possible values of the magnetization @xmath56 , which is a conserved quantity in the model .",
    "for each realization of the disorder and for each @xmath44 , 100 different initial states are evolved for all time . the entanglement entropy @xmath5 is then computed for each @xmath3 and averaged over initial states .

    "we observe three stages : ( 1 ) a short time rapid growth and oscillation of entanglement .",
    "this behavior mainly comes from the direct nearest - neighbor interaction between the two adjacent spins across the center bond , with a time scale set by @xmath59 .",
    "since the entanglement entropy here is dominated by these two spins , it oscillates and can be shown to be independent of system size .",
    "( 2 ) after the short time oscillation , many - body effects become important and cause the entanglement entropy to grow in a logarithmic fashion .",
    "this is the regime of interest .",
    "the growth rate is independent of system size ( not shown ) and extrapolation indicates that the entanglement entropy grows indefinitely , without bound , in the thermodynamic limit . ( 3 ) when entanglement spreads over the entire system , finite - size effects set in and the entanglement entropy saturates .",

    "( a ) the saturated entanglement entropy , @xmath60 , obtained by averaging over the entanglement at large times , is shown as a function of @xmath36 for @xmath52 and a few values of @xmath26 . by fitting the slopes of these lines , we estimate the saturated entanglement entropy per spin @xmath7 .",
    "( b ) the resulting @xmath7 is shown as a function of initial state @xmath44 and @xmath26 .",

    "[ eetime](a ) illustrates how the spreading and the saturation value of the entanglement @xmath61 varies with different values of @xmath44 for a fixed disorder @xmath58 .",
    "because the disorder strength is the same , the localization length @xmath0 for each of these systems should be same , and therefore this plot corroborates our expectation that the entanglement should saturate at the same time for systems with the same localization length , provided they are of the same size .",
    "we can also see that @xmath60 is a decreasing function of @xmath44 ( smaller for initial spins more closely aligned with the @xmath62-axis ) , and that the rates of entanglement growth reflect this trend in saturation values , indicating that the finite - time entanglement is proportional to the saturated value of entanglement .",
    "this variation of the entanglement with @xmath44 can be understood by noting that spins in the @xmath53 plane of the bloch sphere ( @xmath52 ) are equal superpositions of the @xmath55 eigenstates , affording them the greatest potential for dephasing and therefore entanglement generation . since refs . @xcite",
    "considered initial conditions where @xmath54 , they found a final value of entanglement smaller than what we find here for @xmath63 .    to calculate the saturation values , which allow us to obtain @xmath7",
    ", we do the following : at large times , the two farthest apart spins have interacted , and thus the entanglement has spread over the entire system .",

    "there is good agreement between the panels of fig .",
    "[ ratios ] , which checks the dependence of eq .",
    "[ entanglement ] on @xmath7 .",
    "the ratios calculated for @xmath89 are slightly lower than the rest ; we attribute this to the very limited entanglement growth that occurs as @xmath44 gets close to 1 , which makes the spreading rate more difficult to measure .",
    "as already mentioned , there are sizable finite size effects in our data , as the ratios for higher @xmath36 take higher values .",
    "this difference mostly arises from finite - size effects in the estimates of @xmath90 , not @xmath0 .",
    "we speculate that this results from the fact that boundary effects , which are felt more quickly in smaller systems , reduce the spreading of the entanglement ; the localization length , being a static quantity , is less affected .",
    "we have computed the spreading of entanglement in a many - body localized system and numerically evaluated its dependence on disorder strength and initial configuration . as we argued based on the phenomenology of localized bits",
    ", we have shown that the logarithmic growth rate of entanglement is proportional to the product of the localization length , which is dependent primarily on disorder strength , and the final value of entanglement entropy per spin , which , to a good approximation , is dependent only on the initial configuration of the system . within our numerical simulations , we have not seen any other independent contributions ( besides finite size effects ) .",
    "our reasoning mainly relies on the existence of localized pseudospins .",
    "it is an interesting open question to find a systematic way to build these dressed pseudospins from bare spins .",
    "this would allow a more direct measurement of the localization length that enters into driving the spread of entanglement .",
    "we thank joel moore , mari carmen ba@xmath91uls , vadim oganesyan , and arijeet pal for many discussions .",
    "the calculations in this work were performed at the tigress high performance computer center at princeton university .                                  strictly speaking , we can only define the final saturation value of entanglement for a finite - size subsystem .",
    "however , the saturation entanglement entropy _ per spin _ can be defined by taking the limit of infinite time first and then the limit of an infinitely large subsystem .",
    "although the entanglement entropy grows slowly , the method of matrix product states ( mps ) is not favorable for our purpose , since we need to access long times to determine the saturation value of the entanglement .",
    "this final value of the entanglement obeys a volume - law , which requires the bond dimension to grow exponentially with the system size ; furthermore , the trotter errors also become large at these long times ."
