    "the relationship between the bare coupling and the cutoff is an essential ingredient in lattice calculations .",
    "usual monte carlo simulations require the knowledge of this relationship far from the critical point , where corrections to asymptotic scaling could become relevant .    in order to check the relevance of these scaling corrections , in this paper",
    "we present a calculation of the first non - universal coefficient of the lattice @xmath0 function in pure yang - mills theory .",
    "this renormalization group function can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing , @xmath9 the lattice bare coupling , @xmath10 is the renormalized coupling constant and @xmath11 the subtraction point .",
    "it establishes how the bare coupling and the cutoff @xmath8 must simultaneously vary to keep the renormalized quantities fixed .",
    "the first two coefficients in eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) are known as they are scheme - independent .",
    "our purpose is to compute the third coefficient , @xmath12 .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors calculated a quantity related to this coefficient using a coordinate space method @xcite for evaluating the lattice integrals . in our calculation",
    "we have used a different technique where firstly the integrands are taylor expanded in powers of the external momenta and then computed term by term with the introduction of an ir regulator .",
    "the idea is a generalization to two loops of the procedure introduced in @xcite .",
    "our result is an independent check of the calculation in reference @xcite .",
    "our integration method can be straightforwardly generalized to the case with fermions .    in order to facilitate comparison",
    "we have adopted the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will show the method we followed to determine @xmath12 .",
    "we will give explicit formulae that relate the coefficient @xmath12 to the same coefficient in the renormalized @xmath0 function ( see eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) ) . in section 3",
    "we give the final result of our calculation as the two - loop contribution to the coupling renormalization constant and we derive the value for @xmath12 and discuss its consequences for the scaling behaviour of dimensionful quantities in present - day monte carlo simulations for both the standard and energy schemes .",
    "finally , in section 4 we introduce our integration method by solving a typical two - loop integral .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "a list of superficially divergent integrals used in our computation are shown in the appendix .",
    "the involved algebra of the lattice perturbation theory was carried out by making use of a computer code .",
    "the main lines of this code were explained in @xcite and used to compute the three - loop perturbative background of the topological susceptibility in pure yang - mills on the lattice and the three - loop lattice free energy in the same theory , @xcite . for the purpose of the present paper ,",
    "this code was extended to include form factors .",
    "although @xmath12 is a three - loop quantity , it can be computed by evaluating two - loop diagrams on the lattice provided the corresponding coefficient in the renormalized @xmath0 function , @xmath13 , is known .",
    "the renormalized @xmath0 function is defined as @xmath14 this function depends on the renormalization scheme only , hence it must be the same for any regularization . in this section",
    "we will show how the coefficient @xmath15 can be derived from this @xmath0 function .",
    "the bare coupling constant on the lattice @xmath9 and the renormalized one @xmath10 ( for instance in the @xmath16 scheme in the continuum ) are related by @xmath17 where @xmath18 the @xmath19 function ( 1.1 ) can be computed from the previous renormalization constant by calculating the derivative of ( 2.2 ) with respect to the lattice spacing @xmath8 @xmath20 this equation yields @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; while the finiteness of the beta function implies @xmath23 .",

    "we will use the @xmath16 scheme .",
    "had we used eq . ( 2.4 ) then a lattice three - loop calculation would have been needed .",
    "the coefficient @xmath27 was computed in reference @xcite , its value for the gauge group @xmath2 being @xmath28 in this expression @xmath29 and @xmath30 are numerical constants , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 moreover , the coefficient @xmath13 in the @xmath16 scheme is @xcite @xmath36    the computation of the coupling renormalization constant , eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) , is easier in the background field gauge .",
    "in fact , this renormalization constant has a simple relationship with the background field renormalization constant @xcite , @xmath37 relation ( 2.13 ) has been recently proven also on the lattice @xcite .",

    "( 1.1 ) , we get the following dependence of the lattice cutoff on the bare coupling @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the renormalization group invariant mass in the lattice regularization . for the gauge group @xmath78 eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaint ] ) becomes @xmath79 thus in the region @xmath80 the last factor in eq .",

    "we can also calculate the correction to asymptotic scaling in the scheme of the energy  @xcite .",
    "the weak expansion of the average plaquette is  @xcite @xmath86 the coupling constant in this scheme can be defined as @xmath87 with this definition , the third coefficient of the beta function is @xmath88 and the scaling function in @xmath78 becomes @xmath89 in @xmath82 the correction is @xmath90 .",
    "the previous results show that as expected the first correction to asymptotic scaling in the scheme of the energy is much smaller than in the usual standard scheme .",
    "this fact indicates that in the scheme defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ge ] ) asymptotic scaling is possibly satisfied within a few per cent at bare couplings as large as @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we introduce our integration method .",
    "first we show how we computed uv - divergent integrals and then we will say a few words about the convergent integrals .    the method for uv - divergent integrals will be shown by solving the following example @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the external momentum and @xmath94 .",
    "this integral diverges when @xmath95 .",
    "similar one - loop divergent integrals can be computed by the following technique @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : _ i ) _ define the same integral in @xmath96 dimensions ; _ ii ) _ taylor expand this integral in the external momenta until the remainder of the expansion is uv - finite ; _ iii ) _ integrate all terms in this expansion including the remainder and taking into account the ir - divergences that are generated .",
    "the remainder can be computed in the continuum as it is uv - finite .",
    "eventually all ir - poles must cancel giving an ir - finite expression .",
    "notice that the computation of the remainder in the continuum requires an exchange of the limits @xmath97 and @xmath98 ; this delicate operation is valid provided adequate subtractions are made on the integrand .",
    "the method we used to compute the integral ( 4.1 ) is a generalization of this idea beyond one loop .",
    "we must simply apply the same steps to _ every _ loop .",
    "then the integral in eq . ( 4.1 ) becomes ( @xmath99 is an arbitrary mass scale ) @xmath100 where we put @xmath101 ( from now on we will omit the subscript @xmath102 to the @xmath103 ) .",
    "now the integral in ( 4.2 ) is uv - finite and we can exchange the uv and ir limits to rewrite it as @xmath104 which can be computed by continuum methods .",
    "the first and third terms in eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) can be combined to give @xmath105 the @xmath106-integration is uv - finite , therefore we can solve this integral by perfoming the corresponding continuum limit .",
    "the second term in eq . ( 4.3 ) is ir - divergent and can be calculated by performing a chain of adequate additions and subtractions .",
    "we can rewrite it as @xmath107 this operation has not modified the bad ir and uv properties of the integrand . however , eq . ( [ eq : p3 ] ) can be computed numerically as we will show below .",
    "let us study eq .",
    "( [ eq : p3prev ] ) .",
    "we would know how to solve this integration if it was written in the continuum .",
    "following this hint we add and subtract the analogous expression in the continuum for the integration in @xmath108 to get @xmath109 as expected , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p4 ] ) is ir - finite so that it can be computed numerically in 4 dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the subtraction of fractions in the @xmath108-integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p4post ] ) makes its @xmath106-integration ir - finite .",
    "therefore all ir - divergences in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p4post ] ) are due to the @xmath110 region in the @xmath108-integration .",
    "hence a possible way to solve this integral is to split the @xmath108-integration into two regions @xmath111 where @xmath112 means that the integration domain covers all the euclidean space - time except for a hypercube of side @xmath113 around the origin .",
    "now , eq . ( [ eq : p6 ] )",
    "is ir - finite and can be evaluated numerically in @xmath114 dimensions . integral ( [ eq : p5 ] ) can be solved by continuum techniques .    some one - loop",
    "ir - divergent integrals are needed to @xmath115 .",

    "the second one needs first an expansion in powers of @xmath103 , then the schwinger parametrization can be used .    after evaluating the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p1],[eq : p2],[eq : p3],[eq : p4],[eq : p5],[eq : p6 ] ) and adding up the partial results we obtain @xmath117 as expected , this result is independent of the ir regularization we used .    in table",
    "i we show a list of the main two - loop divergent integrals used in this work .",
    "all entries in this table have been computed by using the above technique and the results agree with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all the other superficially divergent integrals appearing in our computation can be rewritten in terms of this basic set plus some finite integrals .",
    "the finite lattice integrals have been solved either by using a method based on schwinger parameters explained in ref .",

    "the infinite lattice value of the integral is @xmath124 .",
    "both methods agree .",
    "we did not push the precision to more than four or five digits ( for practical purposes in numerical simulations , knowledge of four digits is sufficient ) .    in the appendix and in table ii we give the list of supercifially divergent integrals encountered during our computation .",
