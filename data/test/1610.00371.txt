    "stars born with initial masses up to 8.510.6  m@xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to at least 95% of all stars , become white dwarfs when they can not fuse nuclear elements in the core anymore . for single star evolution ,",
    "the minimum mass of the white dwarf is around 0.30@xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering the mass - radius relation of white dwarfs , this corresponds to a @xmath10 .",
    "progenitors that would become lower mass white dwarfs live on the main sequence longer than the age of the universe .",
    "we therefore determine our mass distribution only for white dwarfs with @xmath11 .",
    "we estimated the masses of all da white dwarfs found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among the 4.5 million spectra acquired by the sloan digital sky survey data release 12 . for the mass distribution",
    "we only consider spectra with s / n@xmath12 to have reliable mass determinations .",
    "the spectra were fitted with synthetic spectra from model atmospheres of @xcite , using ml2/@xmath1 for das , and ml2/@xmath3 , for dbs .",
    "we use the mass  radius relations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , to calculate the mass of our stars from the @xmath13 and @xmath14 values obtained from our fits , after correcting to 3d convection following @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dadb ] shows the mass distribution by number for das with @xmath15  k , where convection is unimportant , and for dbs with @xmath16  k reported by @xcite .",
    "because our surface gravities show an unexplained decrease below @xmath17  k , figure  [ histv10 m ] shows the mass distribution for different cutoff temperatures .",
    "considering white dwarfs with larger mass have smaller radius , and therefore can only be seen to smaller distances in a magnitude limited survey as sdss , we calculated the density by correcting the visible volume with the @xmath6 method of @xcite , up to a maximum g=19 magnitude , shown in figure  [ histv10 m ] .",
    "the distribution shows that the da and db distributions have very different shapes .",
    "the da s has a tail to larger masses , while the db s is extended to lower masses .",
    "this is probably reflecting some limitation in the progenitors that can undergo very - late thermal pulses and become dbs .",
    "with our population synthesis analysis , we computed a theoretical mass distribution through a monte carlo simulation fitting single star initial mass functions , initial - to - final mass relations for masses @xmath18 , to obtain a history of star formation for the das with @xmath19  k. figure  [ histv13ps ] shows the mean mass around 0.64  @xmath20 requires a burst of star formation in the last 2  gyr , as a white dwarf with such mass has a short lived progenitor mass with a mass around @xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast with the uniform star formation estimated by @xcite from the ml2/@xmath22 mass distribution of @xcite .",
    "convolving the intensities from the theoretical models with filter transmission curves , and appropriate zero - points , we estimated the corresponding absolute magnitudes . comparing with the observed g - filter photometry we estimated the distance modulus , obtaining the distances .",
    "from distances and the galactic latitude , we estimated the distance of each star from the galactic plane z. figure  [ z ] shows the distance above the galactic plane for each star studied , showing the disc scale height is around 300  pc for das and a few parsecs larger for dbs .",
    "finally , using the distances , our measured radial velocities and the proper motions obtained from apop @xcite only for those stars which has a measured proper motion larger than three times its uncertainty , we estimated the galactic velocities u , v , and w for each star ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "we compared the proper motions from apop @xcite with those of @xcite and they are very similar . in figure",
    "[ uvws ] , we show the galactic velocities we infer for each star .",
    "as expected , most white dwarfs observed by sdss belong to the thin and thick disk . because of the saturation limit around @xmath23 , nearby white dwarfs only if very cool are included .",
    "the sdss observations are also preferentially for directions across the galactic disk .",
