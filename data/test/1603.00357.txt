    "it is well known that relativistic quantum field theory models with four - fermion ( 4f ) interactions serve as effective theories for low energy considerations of different real phenomena in a variety of physical branches .",
    "for example , the meson spectroscopy , neutron star and heavy - ion collision physics are often investigated in the framework of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional 4f theories @xcite , known as nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) models @xcite .",
    "in particular , low dimensional 4f field theories provide a powerful tool for investigations in condensed - matter physics .",
    "indeed , physics of ( quasi)one - dimensional organic peierls insulators ( the best known material of this kind is polyacetylene ) is well described in terms of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional 4f gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite .",
    "the quasirelativistic treatment of electrons in planar systems like high - temperature superconductors or in graphene ( a planar monoatomic layer of carbon atoms ) is also possible in terms of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn models @xcite .",
    "notice that there are physical effects , which were observed for the first time just in the framework of njl- and gn - type models .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of a dynamical generation of a fermion mass is well - known for strong interaction physics since the time , when nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite proved a dynamical breaking of the continuous @xmath2-symmetry on the basis of a generic 4f interaction theory .",
    "later on , this effect served as the basis of a qualitatively successful description of the low - energy meson spectrum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of dynamical symmetry breaking and generation of a fermion mass is also known in low dimensional , d=1 + 1 and d=2 + 1 , gn theories @xcite , where the four - fermion theory is renormalizable and asymptotic free @xcite in the case of d=1 + 1 , whereas for d=2 + 1 the 4f gn models are perturbatively nonrenormalizable but become renormalizable in the framework of the @xmath3 expansion technique @xcite ( @xmath4 being the number of fermion fields ) .",
    "another example of this kind is the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking induced by external magnetic or chromomagnetic fields .",
    "this effect was for the first time studied also in terms of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn model @xcite .",
    "note in addition that due to a rather simple structure , different low dimensional gn models provide a good laboratory for a deeper study of dense baryon matter and , in particular , for the consideration of such phenomena as ( color)superconductivity @xcite , charged pion condensation @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , these theories are very useful in developing new quantum field theoretical techniques like the @xmath3 expansion @xcite , the optimized perturbation theory @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is necessary to point out that there is one more , not yet mentioned above , phenomenon that is still a well - known feature of only some ( 1 + 1)-dimensional 4f theories .",
    "this is the duality correspondence between chiral symmetry breaking and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "( in order to avoid the prohibition of cooper pairing as well as spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models @xcite , the consideration should be performed in the leading order of the @xmath3-technique , i.e. in the large-@xmath4 limit assumption . in this case",
    "quantum fluctuations , which would otherwise destroy a long - range order corresponding to spontaneous symmetry breaking , are suppressed by @xmath3 factors . ) to formulate this phenomenon , let us imagine that there is a microscopic 4f theory ( for d=1 + 1 see , e.g. , @xcite ) which describes a competition between fermion - antifermion ( or chiral ) and difermion ( or superconducting ) channels of interaction .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the ground state of the model is characterized by nonzero fermion number- and chiral charge densities ( the last is an imbalance between densities of left- and right - handed fermions ) , i.e. there are two external parameters , fermion number- @xmath0 and chiral charge- @xmath1 chemical potentials , respectively .",
    "then the duality phenomenon means that the phase structure of this 4f model is symmetric with respect to the following simultaneous transformations @xmath5 , @xmath6 and chiral symmetry breaking @xmath7 superconductivity ( here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the coupling constants in the chiral and superconducting channels , respectively ) .",
    "thus , there is a correspondence between properties ( phase structure ) of the model , e.g. , at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , etc .",
    "moreover , knowing condensates and other dynamical and thermodynamical quantities of the system , e.g. in the chirally broken phase , one can obtain the corresponding quantities in the superconducting phase of the model , by simply performing there the duality transformation .",
    "it is worth to note that in recent years properties of media with nonzero chiral chemical potential @xmath1 , i.e. chiral media , attracted considerable interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in nature , chiral media might be realized in heavy - ion collisions , compact stars , condensed matter systems , etc .",
    "@xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) . in particular , one can expect that in the quark - gluon - plasma phase of qcd a chirality imbalance is produced , i.e. there appears a nonzero chiral charge density @xmath12 .",
    "the combined effect of the chiral imbalance and of the very strong magnetic field , which can be produced at noncentral heavy ion collision , results in the so - called chiral magnetic effect ( see , e.g. , the paper @xcite ) .",
    "it means that there might be induced an electric current along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "it is important to note that this phenomenon is described effectively in the framework of 4f models with a chiral chemical potential @xmath1 , i.e. in terms of a quantity conjugated to the chiral charge density @xmath12 .",
    "recently , it was established that in planar condensed matter systems there may exists a phenomenon , which can be regarded as an analogue of the qcd chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "this is the pseudo chiral magnetic effect , which can be observed , e.g. , in a distorted graphene sheet under the influence of external in - plane magnetic field .",
    "indeed , due to a mechanical distortion of the lattice structure of graphene , there might appears a nonzero chiral charge density @xmath12 ( chiral imbalance ) as well as a conserved electric current along the in - plane external magnetic field ( for details , see the paper @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , similar to the qcd chiral magnetic effect , one might expect that the pseudo chiral magnetic effect can be effectively described in terms of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4f models with nonzero chiral chemical potential @xmath1 ( in addiion to the usual chemical potential @xmath0 ) . finally , it is important to remark that a mechanical distortion of the lattice structure in graphene - like materials ( as well as other external perturbations ) can also lead to opening of different superconducting channels in the system @xcite .",
    "thus , it makes sense to study a competition between chiral symmetry breaking and superconductivity in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theories with chiral chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is important to predict / observe the possible duality relations between these qualitatively different phenomena accompanied by @xmath1 in field theories in spacetime dimensions d@xmath131 + 1 . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that there exists a dual correspondence ( or dual symmetry ) between the phenomena of the chiral symmetry breaking and superconductivity in the framework of some ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4f models .",
    "the consideration is performed at zero temperature @xmath14 , however it can be easily generalized to the case @xmath15 .",
    "we hope that our investigations shed some new light on the physical effects in planar condensed matter systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4f gn - type model , containing both fermion - antifermion ( or chiral ) and difermion ( or superconducting ) interaction channels and including two kinds of chemical potentials , @xmath16 , is presented . here",
    "we show that under the pauli - grsey transformations of fermi fields there is a dual relationship between the relevant 4f structures .",
    "next , the unrenormalized thermodynamic potential ( tdp ) of the gn - type model is given in the leading order of the large - n expansion . in sec",
    "iii the dual symmetry of the model tdp is established .",
    "it means that it is invariant under the interchange of coupling constants , @xmath16 chemical potentials and chiral and superconducting condensates .",
    "moreover , the renormalization of the tdp is performed .",
    "iv contains a detailed numerical investigation of various phase portraits with particular emphasis on the role of the duality symmetry of the tdp .",
    "some technical details are relegated to appendices . moreover , in appendix [ apd ] we present an alternative ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn model with dual relationship between other chiral and superconducting channels of 4f interaction .",
    "our investigation is based on a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn  type model with massless fermions belonging to a fundamental multiplet of the auxiliary @xmath17 flavor group .",
    "its lagrangian describes the interaction both in the fermion  antifermion and difermion ( or superconducting ) channels : @xmath18\\psi_k&+ & \\frac { g_1}n\\left ( 4f\\right ) _",
    "{ ch}+\\frac { g_2}n\\left ( 4f\\right ) _ { sc},\\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the four - fermion structures @xmath19 and @xmath20 are used , @xmath21 in addition , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ( 1 ) denote a fermion number chemical potential and a chiral ( axial ) chemical potential , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is conjugated to a fermion number density @xmath22 , whereas @xmath1 is conjugated to a nonzero density of chiral charge @xmath23 , which represents an imbalance in densities of the right- and left - handed fermions .",
    "as it is noted above , all fermion fields @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) form a fundamental multiplet of the @xmath17 group . moreover ,",
    "each field @xmath24 is a four - component ( reducible ) dirac spinor ( the symbol @xmath14 denotes the transposition operation ) .",
    "therefore , in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) the quantities @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 are matrices in the four - dimensional spinor space .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the algebra of these matrices as well as their particular representations are given in appendix [ apa ] .",
    "clearly , the lagrangian @xmath30 is invariant under transformations from the internal auxiliary @xmath17 group , which is introduced here in order to make it possible to perform all the calculations in the framework of the nonperturbative large-@xmath4 expansion method .",
    "physically more interesting is that the model ( 1 ) is invariant under transformations from the @xmath31 group , where @xmath32 is the fermion number conservation group , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the group of continuous chiral transformations , @xmath36 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it means that in the framework of the model ( 1 ) both the particle number density @xmath37 and the density of chiral charge @xmath38 are conserved quantities .",
    ", which anticommutes with @xmath26 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath28 , one can consider another continuous chiral @xmath40 transformation group of the spinor fields , @xmath41 ( @xmath25 ) . alternatively , there exists a 4f model with another fermion  antifermion and difermion channels of interaction , which , in addition to @xmath32 , is invariant under the continuous chiral @xmath40 group ( see appendix [ apd ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of graphene reducible four - component spinors just describe the two sublattice ( or pseudospin ) and two valley ( or dirac point ) degrees of freedom of the hexagonal honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . ]    before studying the thermodynamics of the model , we would like to point out that there is a so - called duality correspondence between chiral and superconducting channels of the model ( 1)-(2 ) . to see this",
    ", it is very useful to form an infinite set @xmath42 composed of all lagrangians @xmath43 when the free model parameters @xmath44 and @xmath1 take arbitrary admissible values , i.e. @xmath45 at arbitrary fixed values of coupling constants @xmath46 , @xmath47 and chemical potentials @xmath48 . then , let us perform in ( 1)-(2 ) the so - called pauli - grsey ( pg ) transformation of spinor fields @xcite , @xmath49 taking into account that all spinor fields anticommute with each other , it is easy to see that under the action of the transformations ( [ 0004 ] ) the 4f structures of the lagrangian ( 1 ) are converted into themselves , i.e. @xmath50 and , moreover , each element ( lagrangian ) @xmath43 of the set @xmath51 is transformed into another element of the set @xmath51 according to the following rule @xmath52 i.e. the set @xmath51 is invariant under the field transformations ( [ 0004 ] ) .",
    "owing to the relations ( [ 040 ] ) and ( [ 004 ] ) there is a connection between properties of the model at some fixed free model parameters @xmath53 and properties of the model in the case , when @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in particular ,",
    "if at some fixed @xmath44 and @xmath1 we have the chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) phase , then at @xmath5 and @xmath6 one can definitely predict the superconducting ( sc ) phase , and vice versa . due to this reason",
    ", we will call the relations ( [ 040 ] ) and ( [ 004 ] ) the duality property of the model ( or duality correspondence between csb and sc ) .",
    "note also that in appendix [ apd ] we present another ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4f model , in which the duality correspondence between alternative chiral and superconducting channels is realized .",
    "further on , we will study the role and the influence of the duality property of the model ( 1 ) on its phase structure . to this end , we introduce the semi - bosonized version of lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) that contains only quadratic powers of fermionic fields as well as auxiliary bosonic fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58\\psi_k   -\\frac{n(\\sigma^2+\\pi^2)}{4g_1 } -\\frac n{4g_2}\\delta^{*}\\delta-   \\frac{\\delta^{*}}{2}[\\psi_k^tc\\psi_k ] -\\frac{\\delta}{2}[\\bar\\psi_k c\\bar\\psi_k^t ] .",

    "the tdp ( [ 012 ] ) is invariant with respect to the so - called duality transformation @xcite , @xmath109 notice that this invariance of the tdp is a consequence of the rule ( [ 004 ] ) , according to which the 4f lagrangian ( 1 ) is modified under the pauli - gursey transformation ( [ 0004 ] ) of the spinor field .    in powers of @xmath97 the fourth - degree polynomial @xmath110 has the following form @xmath111 expanding the right - hand side of ( [ 17 ] ) in powers of @xmath87",

    "the fourth - order polynomial with similar coefficients @xmath118 ( [ 013 ] ) was studied in our paper @xcite , where it was shown that all its roots @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) are real quantities ( see appendix b in @xcite ) .",
    "the roots @xmath119 are the energies of quasiparticle or quasiantiparticle excitations of the system . in particular",
    ", it follows from ( [ 17 ] ) that at @xmath121 @xmath122 whereas it is clear from ( [ 18 ] ) that at @xmath123 @xmath124 taking into account in ( [ 012 ] ) the relation ( [ 170 ] ) as well as the formula @xmath125 ( obtained rigorously , e.g. , in appendix b of @xcite and being true up to an infinite term independent of the real quantity @xmath126 ) , it is possible to integrate there over @xmath127 .",

    "since in this case a thermodynamic potential is usually called effective potential , we use for it the notation @xmath132 .",

    "the same property is also valid for @xmath148 .",
    "hence , taking into account in ( [ 12 ] ) the relations ( [ 13 ] ) and ignoring there an infinite @xmath87- and @xmath97-independent constant , one obtains the following _ renormalized _ , i.e. finite , expression @xmath149 for the effective potential , @xmath150 it should also be mentioned that the effective potential ( [ 14 ] ) is a renormalization group invariant quantity .",
    "the fact that it is possible to renormalize the effective potential of the initial model ( 1 ) in the leading order of the large @xmath4-expansion is the reflection of a more general property of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theories with four - fermion interactions .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in the framework of the  naive  perturbation theory ( over coupling constants ) these models are not renormalizable . however , as it was proved in @xcite , in the framework of nonperturbative large @xmath4-technique these models are renormalizable in each order of the @xmath3-expansion .    the @xmath145 term in ( [ 12 ] ) can be calculated explicitly , so we have for the renormalized effective potential @xmath149 ( [ 14 ] ) the following expression @xmath151 the global minimum point @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath154 , of this function was already investigated in @xcite , although in the framework of another ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn model .",

    "i , ii or iii is implemented . in the phase",
    "i , i.e. at @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the global minimum of the effective potential @xmath160 is arranged at the origin .",

    "in the phase i both continuous symmetries , chiral @xmath35 and electromagnetic @xmath32 , remain intact and fermions are massless . due to this reason",
    "the phase i is called symmetric . in the phase ii , which is allowed only for @xmath163 , at the global minimum point",
    "the relations @xmath164 and @xmath162 are valid .",
    "so in this phase chiral @xmath35 symmetry is spontaneously broken down and fermions acquire dynamically the mass @xmath165 . finally , in the superconducting phase iii , where @xmath166 , we have spontaneous breaking of the @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "this phase corresponds to the following values of the gaps : @xmath161 , @xmath167 .",
    "note also that if @xmath168 and , in addition , @xmath169 ( it is just the line _",
    "l _ in fig .",
    "1 ) , then the effective potential ( [ 15 ] ) has two equivalent global minima . the first one , the point @xmath170 , corresponds to a phase with chiral symmetry breaking . the second one , i.e. the point @xmath171 , corresponds to superconductivity .",
    "clearly , if the cutoff parameter @xmath137 is fixed , then the phase structure of the model can be described in terms of bare coupling constants @xmath172 instead of finite quantities @xmath173 .",
    "indeed , let us first introduce a critical value of the couplings , @xmath174 . then , as it follows from fig . 1 and ( [ 13 ] ) , at @xmath175 and @xmath176 the symmetric phase i of the model is located . if @xmath177 , @xmath176 ( @xmath175 , @xmath178 ) , then the chiral symmetry broken phase ii ( the superconducting phase iii ) is realized .",
    "finally , let us suppose that both @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in this case at @xmath11 ( @xmath10 )",
    "we have again the chiral symmetry broken phase ii ( the superconducting phase iii ) .",

    "moreover , strong constraints were obtained there on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , at which color sc or csb is generated dynamically in the models . ]    the second way , i.e. the mechanism ( ii ) , to break spontaneously a symmetry can be realized only at nonzero chemical potentials .",

    "the fermi surface can be created . as a result ,",
    "if there is an _ arbitrary small attraction _ in the sc channel , i.e. even at @xmath176 , there appears the so - called cooper instability of the fermi surface , which destroys the normal ground state in favor of superconductivity .",

    "we have seen that the global minimum of the tdp @xmath192 is always at the point of the form @xmath193 or @xmath194 .",

    "in other words the chiral condensate of the csb phase at fixed @xmath228 is equal to the sc condensate of the phase at @xmath229 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the duality transformation ( [ 16 ] ) of the tdp can also be applied to the arbitrary phase portrait of the model ( see below ) . in particular , it is clear that if we have a most general phase portrait , i.e. the correspondence between any point @xmath230 of the four - dimensional space of external parameters and possible model phases ( csb , sc and symmetric phase ) , then under the duality transformation ( @xmath231 , @xmath6 , csb@xmath7sc ) this phase portrait is mapped to itself , i.e. the most general phase portrait is selfdual . in practice , usually , there are constraints on the model parameters . as a result ,",
    "if the constraint is dually ( non)invariant , then the phase portrait is also a dually ( non)invariant .",
    "below , we will use the dual symmetry of the tdp in order to explain and construct the phase structure of the model in different particular cases .",
    "+      first of all , taking into account the duality correspondence between csb and sc , let us determine its characteristic features and then find ( analytically and numerically ) the phase structure of the model ( 1 ) in two particular cases , ( i ) @xmath232 and ( ii ) @xmath233 .",
    "it is evident that both of these constraints , ( i ) and ( ii ) , are invariant with respect to the duality transformation @xmath231 , @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the corresponding phase portraits should be selfdual ( a more detailed explanation of this fact is presented in the next subsection ) . in the case ( i )",
    "we want to study the @xmath157 phase portrait , whereas in the case ( ii )  the @xmath234 phase portrait .",
    "it follows from the duality correspondence that in the case ( i ) the region of the csb phase is a mirror image of the sc phase with respect to the line @xmath233 of the @xmath157 plane .",
    "however , in the case ( ii ) the regions of these phases are arranged mirror symmetrically with respect to the line @xmath232 of the plane @xmath234 .    of course , the specific form of the csb and sc areas depends on the values of the external parameters .",
    "for example , at @xmath235 the phase structure is presented in fig",
    "( note that in order to obtain this phase portrait it is sufficient to investigate the behavior of the global minimum point of the tdp @xmath149 ( [ 15 ] ) vs the coupling constants @xmath155 and @xmath156 . ) however , at fixed @xmath236 the phase structure is presented in fig .",

    "3 , the second order phase transition takes place . in this case it is possible to give exact analytical expressions for the boundaries of the region i in fig .",

    "3 we have @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "however , on the boundary between phases i and ii one can see that @xmath161 and , moreover , that @xmath243 . it is the last relation that defines the boundary equation between i and ii phases .",
    "this equation looks like @xmath244 in a similar way it is possible to find the equation for the boundary between i and iii phases of fig . 3 : @xmath245 in contrast , on the boundary of the phase i of fig .",
    "4 , a phase transition of the first order takes place . since on the boundary between ii and iii phases of this figure",
    "we also have a first order phase transitions , it is clear that the point t of the phase portrait fig .",
    "4 is a so - called triple point , i.e. the point where three different phases , i , ii and iii , coexist .",
    "the triple point t of fig . 4 corresponds to the chemical potential values @xmath246 .        in these two particular cases the restrictions on the external model parameters are already not dually invariant , so the corresponding @xmath157-phase portraits are not selfdual .",
    "however , as we shall see , each of these two phase portraits is a dual mapping of another one .    the @xmath157-phase structure of the model at arbitrary fixed nonzero value of @xmath0 ( of @xmath1 ) and at @xmath131 ( at @xmath130 )",
    "is presented in fig . 5 ( in fig . 6 )",
    "let us first compare fig . 1 and fig",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath235 , then the system is in the symmetric phase i ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . however , an arbitrary small nonzero value of the chemical potential @xmath0 induces ( at @xmath131 ) in this case the superconducting phase iii ( see fig .",
    "5 as well as fig . 3 for the particular case @xmath248 ) . note that there is a very simple explanation of this fact , which is based on the symmetry breaking mechanism ( ii ) ( see the end of the section iii a ) , i.e. on the cooper instability of a fermi surface .",
    "indeed , at @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath180 we have a nonzero particle density ( see , e.g. , in @xcite ) , so there is a fermi sea of particles with energies less or equal to @xmath0 ( fermi surface ) .",
    "evidently , in this case there is no energy cost for creating a pair of particles with opposite momenta just over the fermi surface .",
    "then , due to an arbitrary weak attraction between these particles ( @xmath249 ) , the cooper pair is formed and @xmath32 symmetry is spontaneously broken , as a result of bose ",
    "einstein condensation of cooper pairs .",
    "since in the energy spectrum of fermions the gap @xmath250 appears , rather small external forces are not able to destroy the superconducting condensate and it is a stable one .    if @xmath158 , @xmath166 , then we have a rather strong interaction in the sc channel , i.e. @xmath178 and @xmath175 . as a result , in this case both at @xmath130 and @xmath180 the dynamical symmetry breaking mechnism ( i ) ( see the end of the section iii a ) plays a decisive role in the forming of sc phenomenon .",
    "now suppose that @xmath251 and @xmath252 , i.e. @xmath177 .",

    "( for example , in this case the global minimum point of the csb phase , i.e. the point @xmath259 , is transformed into the point @xmath260 and , as a result , the csb phase is transformed into the sc phase . )",
