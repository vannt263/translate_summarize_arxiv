    "the observations of distant supernovae @xcite give the evidence that our universe is undergoing accelerated expansion in the present epoch . in principle , there are two different approaches to treat this phenomenon . in the first approach",
    "it is postulated that there is some unknown exotic matter which violates the strong energy condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pressure and @xmath3 is the energy density of perfect fluid .",
    "this form of matter is called dark energy . in the past few years",
    "different scalar field models like quintessence and more recently the tachyonic scalar field have been conjectured for modelling the dark energy in terms of sub - negative pressure @xmath4 . a scalar field with super - negative pressure @xmath5 called a phantom field",
    "can formally be obtained by switching the sign of the kinetic energy in the lagrangian for a standard scalar field .",
    "for example in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model the phantom field minimally coupled to a gravity field leads to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the phantom potential .",
    "such a field was called the phantom field by caldwell @xcite who proposed it as a possible explanation of the observed acceleration of the current universe when @xmath10 .",
    "note that a coupling to gravity in the quintessence models was also explored @xcite .",
    "the second approach called the cardassian expansion scenario has recently been proposed by freese and lewis @xcite as an alternative to dark energy in order to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe . in this scenario",
    "the universe is flat and matter dominated but the standard frw dynamics is modified by the presence of an additional term @xmath11 such that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter ; and @xmath14 is the scale factor .",
    "however , let us note that this additional term can be interpreted as a phantom field modelled by the equation of state @xmath15 \\rho$ ] , where @xmath16 . therefore for dust matter",
    "we obtain @xmath17 , and @xmath18 leads to the phantom field . the cardassian expansion with @xmath18 which can be interpreted as the phantom fluid effect .",
    "phantom fields lead to the super - accelerated expansion of the universe , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "the simplest models describe this field in terms of minimally coupled real scalar field with the negative kinetic energy term @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that phantom fields are also present in string theories @xcite . and arise as a phenomenological description of quantum effects of particle production in terms of bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "because the phantom fields violate the lorentz invariance condition most physicists believe that the phantoms open the doors on new physics @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the theoretical possibility to describe dark energy in terms of phantom field was the subject of many papers @xcite .",

    "also some other basic problems in cosmology like the problem of direction of time can be solved .",
    "if we confront the phantom field model with the observation of snia data we obtain that it is the best candidate together with the @xmath21cdm model for the substantial form of dark energy @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate new dynamical effects created in the presence of phantom fields .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to model the phantom fields in terms of scalar fields with a potential rather than in terms of the barotropic equation of state . for the latter case",
    "the dynamics is regular and can be represented on the two - dimensional phase space @xcite .",
    "usually phantom fields are modelled in terms of minimally coupled scalar fields the case of minimally coupled to gravity phantom fields was analyzed in the context of existence of periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the dynamics is trivial in a sense of nonexistence of periodic solutions .",
    "faraoni used the framework of phase space for investigating the dynamics of phantom cosmology , late - time attractors , and their existence for different shapes of potential @xcite .",
    "it was showed that dynamics of the flat frw universe can be reduced to the form of a two - dimensional dynamical system on a double sheeted phase space .",
    "it is a simple consequence of an algebraic equation for @xmath22 which can be expressed as a function of the hubble parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this case",

    "the significance of long - wavelength modes in the wkb approximation of a conformally coupled scalar field was analyzed in the inflationary scenario @xcite .",

    "faraoni @xcite discusses different motivations for choosing @xmath26 ( both positive and negative ) from the theoretical point of view and from observational constraints .",
    "the inflation and quintessence with the non - minimal coupling were studied in the context of the formulation of some necessary conditions for acceleration of the universe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "faraoni also pointed out that the non - minimally coupling term different from the conformal coupling value ( @xmath27 ) spoils the equivalence principle of general relativity .",
    "it is interesting that some observational constraints on the non - minimal coupling ( possitive or negative ) can be found from cmb observations .",

    "the constraints on the ratio of the self - coupling and non - minimal coupling constant can be obtained during the inflation period @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we ask what kind of dynamics can be expected from the frw model with phantom field .",
    "it is well known that the standard frw model reveals some complex dynamics .",
    "the detailed studies gave us a deeper understanding of dynamical complexity and chaos in cosmological models and resulted in conclusion that complex behavior depends on the choice of a time parameterization or a lapse function in general relativity @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed that dynamics of the closed frw models with a conformally coupled massive scalar field is not chaotic if considered in the cosmological time .",
    "the same model was analyzed in the conformal time by calzetta and hasi @xcite who presented the existence of chaotic behavior of trajectories in the phase space .",
    "motter and letelier @xcite explained that this contradiction in the results is obtained because the system under consideration is non - integrable .",
    "therefore we can speak about complex dynamics in terms of nonintegrability rather than deterministic chaos .",
    "the significant feature is that nonintegrability is an invariant evidence of dynamical complexity in general relativity and cosmology @xcite .",
    "we can find many analogies between models with spontaneously symmetry breaking and the yang - mills systems .",
    "problems of chaotic behavior in the yang - mills cosmological models have been investigated by barrow and his collaborators .",
    "chaos from yang - mills can only occur in an anisotropic universe but it occurs for some arbitrarily small anisotropy ( see the study of bianchi i @xcite and other bianchi types @xcite ) . however , when a perfect fluid is added things change in an interesting way that contrast with the situation with a magnetic field @xcite .    for the frw model with phantom",
    "it can be shown that there is a monotonous function along its trajectories and it is not possible to obtain the lyapunov exponents or construct the poincar sections .",
    "therefore it is useful to study the nonintegrability of the phantom system and set it in a much stronger form by proving that the system does not possess any additional and independent of hamiltonian first integrals , which are in the form of analytic or meromorphic functions .",
    "of course , it is not the evidence of sensitive dependence of solution on a small change of initial conditions .",
    "however , it is the possible evidence of complexity of dynamical behavior formulated in an invariant way @xcite .",
    "the notion of deterministic chaos is a controversial issue in the mixmaster models .",
    "the value of the numerically computed maximal lyapunov exponent for those systems depends on the time parameterization used @xcite . however , the existence of fractal structures in the phase space provides the coordinate independent signal of chaos in cosmology as it was shown by cornish and levin @xcite .",
    "in particular , they found that the bianchi ix has a form of chaotic scattering .",
    "the short scattering periods intermittent integrable motion and evolution of the system is chaotic .",
    "it is similar to a pin - ball machine .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that dynamics of phantom cosmology can be treated as a scattering process . only if the spontaneously symmetry breaking is admitted this process has chaotic character .",
    "evidences of dynamical behavior are studied in tools of symbolic dynamics , fractal dimension , and analytically the toda - brumer - duff test .",

    ".    the dynamical equation for phantom cosmology in which the phantom field is modelled by the scalar field with an opposite sign of the kinetic term in action can be obtained from the variational principle @xmath46 . after dropping the full derivatives with respect to time we obtain the dynamical equation for phantom cosmology from variation @xmath47 as well as the dynamical equation for field from variation @xmath48 @xmath49",
    "it can be shown that for any value of @xmath42 the phantom behaves like some perfect fluid with the effective energy @xmath50 and the pressure @xmath51 in the form which determines the equation of state factor @xmath52   + \\xi \\psi^{2}(2\\dot{h}+3h^{2})}{-\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\psi}^{2}+u(\\psi ) - 3\\xi h[h\\psi^{2}+(\\psi^{2})\\dot{\\ } ] } \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\psi}}{\\rho_{\\psi}}. \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] formula  ( [ eq:8 ] ) differs from its counterpart for the standard scalar field @xcite by the presence of a negative sign in front of the term @xmath53 .    in equation  ( [ eq:8 ] )",
    "the second derivative @xmath54 in the expression for the pressure can be eliminated and then we obtain @xmath55 of course such perfect fluid which mimics the phantom field satisfies the conservation equation @xmath56 we can see that complexity of a dynamical equation should manifest by complexity of @xmath57 .",
    "let us consider the frw quintessential dynamics with some effective energy density @xmath50 given in equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "this dynamics can be reduced to the form like of a particle in a one - dimensional potential @xcite and the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath58 where a prime means the differentiation with respect to the conformal time @xmath59 .",
    "the trajectories of the system lie on the zero energy level for flat and vacuum models .",
    "note that if we additionally postulate the presence of radiation matter for which @xmath60 then it is equivalent to consider the hamiltonian on the level @xmath61 .",
    "of course the division on kinetic and potential parts has only a conventional character and we can always translate the term containing @xmath53 into a kinetic term .",
    "the dynamics of the model is governed by the equation of motion ( [ eq:7 ] ) , which is equivalent to the conservation condition ( [ eq:10 ] ) and the acceleration condition @xmath62 this equation admits the generalized friedmann first integral which assumes the following form @xmath63 if we postulate existence of radiation in model then left hand of this equation can be negative .",
    "let us consider now both cases of minimally and conformally coupled phantom fields .",
    "they can model the quintessence matter field in terms of matter satisfying the equation of state @xmath64 .",
    "for minimally coupled phantom fields ( @xmath44 ) the function of energy takes the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is assumed .",
    "for conformally coupled phantom fields we put @xmath71 and rescale the field @xmath72 .",
    "then the energy function takes the following form for a simple mechanical system with a natural lagrangian function @xmath73 @xmath74 in contrast to the frw model with conformally coupled scalar field the kinetic energy form is positive definite like for classical mechanical systems .",
    "the general hamiltonian which represents the special case of a two coupled non - harmonic oscillators system is @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are constants .    in order to study the integrability of dynamical systems",
    "we use painlev s approach .",
    "painlev s analysis gives necessary conditions for the integrability of dynamical systems and it is the most popular integrability detector .",
    "the recapitulation of painlev s analysis for system  ( [ eq:15 ] ) was done by lakshmanan and sahadevan @xcite .",
    "they found that system  ( [ eq:15 ] ) passes the painlev test and is integrable in the following four cases @xmath81 this result is in full agreement with conclusions concerning integrability of the two coupled quartic non - harmonic oscillator systems .",
    "therefore , phantom cosmology can be considered as coupled quartic non - harmonic oscillators .",
    "of course , painlev analysis gives necessary conditions for the integrability of dynamical systems .",
    "however , there exist whole classes of integrable systems which do not possess the painlev property .",
    "it means that the painlev approach gives over - restrictive conditions for integrability .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath82 the frw phantom cosmology is integrable because of the possibility to separate of variables in the potential .",
    "then we have two decoupled quartic non - harmonic oscillators .",
    "the non - integrability of the non - flat frw model with the scalar field with the potential @xmath83 was investigated in an analytical way by ziglin @xcite . for a deeper analysis of integrability in terms of ziglin and morales - ruiz and ramis",
    ".    it would be useful to compare hamiltonians for the cosmological model with phantom fields and the standard cosmological model with scalar fields .",
    "let us consider that @xmath84 for simplicity of presentation .",
    "then for both models we have hamiltonians @xmath85 and @xmath86 if we add a radiation component to the energy momentum tensor , which energy density scales like @xmath87 then both systems should be considered on the constant energy level @xmath88 or the constant @xmath89 can be absorbed by the new hamiltonian @xmath90 and @xmath91 is considered on the zero energy level .",
    "let us concentrate on the flat models to analyze the similarities to the yang - mills systems . while the standard cosmological model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath92 the phantom cosmological model is @xmath93    the crucial difference between system ( [ eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) lies in the definiteness of their kinetic energy forms .",
    "it is indefinite and has the lorentzian signature for the standard model , and it is positive definite for the phantom model . as a consequence",
    "we obtain that the configuration space for the standard model is @xmath94 whereas the condition @xmath95 determines the domain of the configuration space admissible for motion for the phantom model .",
    "note that if @xmath96 ( the model with the spontaneously symmetry breaking ) then this domain is bounded by four hyperbolas in every quarter of plane @xmath97 .",
    "the same situation can be obtained for the model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking ( @xmath98 ) and dark radiation ( @xmath99 ) .    the flat phantom model with the spontaneously symmetry breaking is well known as the yang - mills systems which have been analyzed since the pioneering paper by savvidy @xcite . for this system",
    "the lyapunov exponents were found @xcite and the poincar sections were obtained @xcite .",
    "the spatially flat universes filled with the yang - mills fields exhibit chaotic oscillations of these fields @xcite .",
    "this system was also investigated by using the gaussian curvature criterion @xcite .",
    "let us apply this criterion to the non - flat phantom model .",
    "the potential function takes the following form @xmath100 according to this criterion the periodic and quasi - periodic orbits appear in the domains of the configuration space in which the gaussian curvature of a diagram of the potential function is positive .",
    "the line of zero curvature separates these domains from the instability regions where the curvature is negative .",
    "if the total energy of the system @xmath80 increases the system will be in a region of negative curvature for some initial conditions and the motion is chaotic .",
    "let us consider the dynamical system in an autonomous form in the form @xmath101 then we linearized around the special solution and we obtain equation @xmath102 where @xmath103 builds the jacobian and @xmath104 is the deviation vector connecting the points on two nearby trajectories corresponding the same value of parameter @xmath33 . in our case @xmath105 ,",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 then the local instability of nearby trajectories are determined by eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix , i.e. the effective potential @xmath109 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath110 @xmath111 therefore the necessary condition for local instability is that at least one of the eigenvalues is positive @xcite .",
    "these positive values decide about the local instability of trajectories .",
    "note that the negative sign of the gaussian curvature of potential @xmath109 is the sufficient condition of local instability @xcite @xmath112 we can see that test  ( [ eq:22 ] ) of negative curvature adopted in our case gives to @xmath113 .",
    "however it is not a sufficient condition for the chaos .",
    "it should be pointed out that this criterion has a purely local character in contrast to the lyapunov exponent .",
    "moreover the compactness of a region admissible for motion is required for chaos existence .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the toda criterion is only the measure of the local instability of nearby trajectories @xcite .",
    "therefore the presented analysis of the order - chaos transition should be combined with the poincar sections and other deeper indicators of the chaotic behavior .",
    "to make the numerical analysis we need to distinguish the the model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking ( @xmath98 ) and the model with the spontaneously symmetry breaking ( @xmath114 ) . in both cases",
    "the system is considered on the some energy level .",
    "we would like to stress out why we use the nonintegrability criterion instead of standard measure like the lyapunov exponents or poincar sections .",
    "the main reason is that in analogy to castagnino et al.s work @xcite we can find a monotonous function along a trajectory .",
    "this excludes the property of the recurrence the trajectories or topological transitivity in the standard wiggins chaos definition .",
    "then @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) is a monotonous function of the time parameter along the trajectories and trajectories escape to infinity for arbitrary initial conditions . in this case",
    "it is impossible to construct the poincar sections .",
    "it is obvious for any curvature and positive values of @xmath21 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the phase space as well as the configuration space is unbounded in this case .",
    "in contrast to classical chaotic systems there is invariant compact chaotic set for this system .",
    "it does not mean the system is non - chaotic as it does not follow the wiggins definition of chaos .",
    "the essence of this phenomenon has different nature .",
    "the system is oversensitive with respect to small change of initial conditions like in chaotic scattering processes .",
    "the typical case of the model is a class of models without the spontaneously symmetry breaking @xmath120 in this case the domain admissible for motion is unbounded . for the classical mechanical systems with chaos",
    "there are chaotic sets of trajectories on a compact invariant submanifold .",
    "however it does not mean that the system with an unbounded region admissible for motion is nonchaotic because the essence of chaotic behavior is of different nature .",
    "the system can be oversensitive with respect to small changes of initial conditions  the key ingredient of chaos . in this respect",
    "the system is similar to chaotic scattering processes @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems to be natural to use the methods of investigation of scattering processes .    the class a model does not possess the property of sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "moreover , there are no fractal structures of basin boundaries in the phase space .",
    "because the scattering of trajectories in the potential well is present , we deal with the nonchaotic scattering process . in more details",
    "it will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the different chaotic behavior was found in the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) color field in the flat bianchi i spacetime @xcite .",

    "it was showed that the eym systems are also an example of chaotic scattering . because the lyapunov exponents are coordinate dependent",

    "the methods of chaotic scattering are more suitable .",
    "they are extremely useful in this context because of noncompact phase space ( also the configuration space)the major obstacle of the standard analysis of chaos .",

    "note that we can observe chaotic behavior in some cases of the conformally coupled scalar field in the flat universes , when we consider the system on non - zero energy level .",
    "physically it means that the universe is filled with radiation matter .",
    "the reason for which the flat universes with scalar field are non - chaotic lies in lack of invariant measure of chaotic behavior in the general relativity @xcite . in general the standard chaos indicators like lyapunov exponents or kolmogorov - sinai entropy depends on time parameterization . in general relativity there",
    "is freedom of choice of the lapse function which defines reparameterization of time .",
    "the hamiltonian is given modulo the lapse function .",
    "therefore if we consider the hamiltonian frw system with scalar field on zero energy level it is possible that in the hamiltonian constraint @xmath14 i @xmath229 appear only in the combination @xmath230 .",

    "there is no place for chaos ( even the models with the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the new picture appears if the system is described on a non - zero energy level .",
    "then the motion of the system is in the 3-dimensional submanifold of the 4-dimensional phase space .",
    "but in general case there is no possibility of choosing the lapse function in such a way that @xmath14 i @xmath229 contribute in the hamiltonian constraint by the hubble function .    among the conformally coupled models there are in principal two types of behavior .",
    "first , chaotic scattering process takes place for case @xmath114 ( the spontaneously symmetry breaking ) . in this case trajectories",
    "possess the property of topological transitivity which guarantees their recurrence in the phase space and the scattering process takes place around the origin .",
    "it is similar to the chaos appeared in the yang - mills theory . exploring this analogy to this system we calculate a gaussian curvature of the potential function which measure local instability of nearby trajectories .",
    "we proof that this curvature is negative . because the configuration space is bounded in this case the mixing of trajectories is observed .",
    "second , in the opposite case of @xmath98 we characterize dynamics in the system in terms of symbolic dynamics . no fractal structure in the space of initial conditions was found and conclude that the scattering process has not the chaotic character .",
    "we also found that the universe filled with conformally coupled scalar field is accelerating without the positive cosmological constant . in principle , there are two sources of this acceleration .",
    "the acceleration is driven by negative energy density and coefficient of equation of state @xmath208 is greater than @xmath232 .",
    "alternatively , energy density is positive and the coefficient of equation of state can be smaller than @xmath232 .",
    "the latter there is crossing of @xmath233 .",
    "of course , for the explanation of snia data apart from the acceleration of the universe itself , the rate of acceleration is also crucial .",
    "the system with phantom scalar field coupled conformally to gravity in the frw universe can be treated as scattering process with chaotic and nonchaotic character . the generic feature of this class of systems with the spontaneously symmetry breaking is the chaotic scattering of trajectories .",
