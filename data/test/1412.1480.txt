    "clearly , a nuclear outflow is being driven out from the gc .",
    "yet only a handful of gc sightlines have published uv spectroscopy that constrains the kinematics , ionization state , and elemental abundances of the nuclear outflow , including two agn directions @xcite and several stellar directions @xcite . however , none of these uv studies have probed a full sightline through the front and back sides of the fbs within 20  of the gc , where the @xmath6-ray emission , x - ray emission , and ( presumably ) wind activity is strongest .",
    "the only such sightline with published data is the _ optical _ spectrum of the blue supergiant ( @xmath1=1.7 , 6.6 , @xmath7=21@xmath85kpc ) , which shows complex multi - component and profiles spanning @xmath0300kms@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we have initiated an observing program with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to study the gas in the gc region ( defined here as @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) with uv spectroscopy ( program ids 12936 and 13448 ) .",
    "the quasar  ( @xmath11=0.184 , @xmath1=10.4,+11.2 , also known as ) is the lowest latitude and smallest impact parameter to the gc ( @xmath12=2.3kpc ) of any agn in our sample .",

    "was observed on february 10 2014 with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ hst _  for a total of five orbits .",
    "the observations used the g130m/1291 and g160m/1600 grating / central wavelength settings , all four fp - pos positions , and exposure times of 4846s for g130 m and 8664s for g160 m .",
    "individual exposures were aligned in velocity space using the centroids of known low - ion interstellar absorption lines , and then co - added following the same procedures as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra have a velocity resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath020kms@xmath4 , a signal - to - noise ratio near the absorption lines of interest of @xmath01220 ( per resolution element ) , an absolute velocity scale uncertainty of @xmath05kms@xmath4 , and cover the wavelength interval 11331778 , with small gaps between detector segments at 12791288 and 15871598 .",
    "the spectra were normalized around each absorption line using linear continua and for display are rebinned by seven pixels ( one resolution element ) , though the voigt - profile fits ( described below ) were made on the unbinned data .",
    "we obtained several deep  21 cm pointings of the  direction using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) under nrao program gbt/14b-299 , with the goal of detecting the hv components in emission .",
    "multiple scans of  were taken on october 3 and october 4 2014 with the vegas spectrometer in frequency - switching mode , for a total of 35 minutes of integration .",
    "the data were taken by frequency - switching either 3.6 or 4.0mhz , resulting in an unconfused velocity range of at least 760kms@xmath4  about zero velocity at an intrinsic channel spacing of 0.151kms@xmath4 .",
    "the spectra were hanning smoothed , then calibrated and corrected for stray radiation using the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "one of the receiver s two linear polarizations ( plnum=1 ) gave consistently superior instrumental baselines so only those data were used .",
    "a fourth - order polynomial was removed from emission - free portions of the final average .",
    "the resulting spectrum has an rms brightness temperature noise of 17.5mk in a 0.30kms@xmath4  channel , giving a 1@xmath13 sensitivity to a line 40kms@xmath4  wide ( chosen to be typical of galactic hvcs ) of @xmath14()=1.1@xmath1510@xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the cos spectra of  show four absorption components ( see figure 2 ) , centered at @xmath2=@xmath3235 , @xmath35 , + 130 , and + 250kms@xmath4 .",
    "absorption is seen in low - ionization ( , , ) , intermediate - ionization ( ) , and high - ionization ( , , ) species , though the relative strength of absorption differs between components .",
    "the @xmath3235 , @xmath35 , and + 130kms@xmath4  components show absorption in the low , intermediate , and high ions , whereas the + 250kms@xmath4  component is seen in the low- and intermediate ions only ( no , , or ) .",
    "emission in the gbt spectrum is only seen in the @xmath35kms@xmath4component ; in the other three components no  detection is made down to a sensitive 3@xmath13 upper limit @xmath14()@xmath183.3@xmath1510@xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the ionic column densities in the absorption components are given in table 1 .",
    "these were determined by fitting voigt profiles to the data with the vpfit softwarerfc / vpfit.html ] , using simultaneous fits to all available lines of a given ion .",
    "foreground gas in the rotating disk of the galaxy produces absorption at a range of lsr velocities , and a simple model of galactic rotation can be used to predict the maximal allowed velocities for a given latitude and longitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , assuming cylindrical co - rotation .",
    "absorption detected _ outside _ this velocity interval can be attributed to inflow or outflow . toward  the minimum and maximum lsr velocities",
    "are @xmath00kms@xmath4  ( at a distance of 0.0kpc ) and + 174kms@xmath4  ( at 8.8kpc ) , respectively .",
    "therefore : + ( 1 ) the strong @xmath35kms@xmath4  component centered can be ( either partially or completely ) explained by foreground gas in the galactic disk .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the + 130kms@xmath4  component corresponds to distances of 7.1 and 9.9 kpc for co - rotation and so could also be tracing galactic material at @xmath19-distances of 1.4 and 1.9kpc , respectively .",
    "however , for distant inner galaxy sightlines , the assumption of co - rotation breaks down at @xmath20kpc @xcite , potentially because the gas has been cleared out by a wind . thus the + 130kms@xmath4  component might trace a nuclear outflow , but we can not conclusively determine its origin . +",
    "( 3 ) the @xmath3235 and + 250kms@xmath4  components are at least 235 and 76kms@xmath4  away from co - rotation , respectively , and are therefore of most interest for a nuclear outflow . in the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) ,",
    "their velocities are @xmath3190 and + 295kms@xmath4 , assuming the rotation velocity at the solar circle is + 254kms@xmath4  @xcite , and where @xmath21=@xmath2 + 254sin@xmath22cos@xmath23 .",
    "the velocities of these two components are consistent with an origin on the front ( approaching ) and back ( receding ) sides of a biconical nuclear outflow emanating from the gc , a scenario modeled in section 4 and discussed in section 5 .",
    "we note that the observed low - velocity high - ion absorption ( , , and ) is strong compared to other ( non - gc ) galactic halo sight lines @xcite .",
    "in particular ,  shows a @xmath00.5dex excess in low - velocity column density , which may be another sign of gc activity .",
    "we develop simple numerical models to explore the kinematic predictions of a biconical nuclear outflow .",
    "the models are based on the outflow models of @xcite .",
    "we assume the outflow is an non - rotating expanding bicone centered on the gc with a constant mass flux .",
    "a population of @xmath24 test particles is inserted at the base of the outflow , with a uniform filling factor .",
    "the three principal free parameters in the models are the initial outflow velocity @xmath25 , the full opening angle @xmath26 of the bicone , and the velocity profile .",
    "we take @xmath26=110  based on the bicone seen in the _ rosat _ 1.5kev image ( figure 1 ) and investigate the value of @xmath25 needed to explain the @xmath3235 and + 250kms@xmath4  components .",
    "we explore two cases for the velocity profile : constant - velocity ( the simplest case ) , and momentum - driven , where the outflow climbs ballistically out of the galactic potential after being given an initial impulse ( e.g. by ram pressure from a hot wind ) . in the latter case",
    "we use the formalism of @xcite and @xcite to express the velocity as a function of radius from the gc .",
    "we assume the outflow reaches a radial distance of at least 4kpc , distant enough to ensure the  sightline fully intercepts the bicone ( see figure 3 , middle panel ) .",
    "the models are initially computed in the gsr reference frame , but are transformed into the lsr frame for comparison with the data .",
    "for both the constant - velocity and momentum - driven cases , 100 realizations of the models are created , and for each one a line - of - sight with the  coordinates was generated and the kinematic structure measured .",
    "the models do not account for the physical or kinematic properties of the external gaseous medium that confines the flow .",
    "the models are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we find @xmath27kms@xmath4 ; lower velocities do not account for the @xmath3235kms@xmath4  component .",
    "figures 3a ( top view ) and 3b ( side view ) show the velocity structure of the outflow as observed from vantage points outside the galaxy .",
    "these plots illustrate the correspondence between lsr velocity and distance along the line - of - sight .",
    "the velocity fields are asymmetric with respect to the vertical because of the transformation from the gsr to lsr frame , i.e. because we are observing the outflow from a co - rotating frame at a fixed distance .",
    "figure 3c shows the distribution of outflow velocities projected onto the  line - of - sight drawn from 100 realizations of each of the two models .",
    "discrete kinematic structure is seen in any single realization of the model ( not shown in figure ) , but the component velocities differ substantially between any two model runs , so we show the distribution to indicate the _ range _ of velocities predicted .",
    "there are several points to note from the model velocity distributions .",
    "first , the distributions are fairly flat for both constant - velocity and momentum - driven winds , which reflects our choice of model in which gas exists with uniform filling factor within the outflow , not just at the edges .",
    "the prediction of outflowing gas with lsr velocities near 0kms@xmath4  could explain the 0.5dex excess in low - velocity high - ion absorption seen toward .",
    "second , the distributions are _ asymmetric _ around zero , ranging from @xmath0250kms@xmath4  ( this velocity is a consequence of the requirement that we explain the @xmath3235kms@xmath4  component toward ) to @xmath0 + 550kms@xmath4   for the constant - velocity wind , and @xmath0 + 300kms@xmath4  for the momentum - driven wind .",
    "this asymmetry is a projection effect arising because of the finite distance between the sun and the gc ( the near - field effect ) .",
    "third , the momentum - driven wind model is more successful in reproducing the range of velocity components seen toward than the constant - velocity wind model , since the latter predicts gas in the range @xmath0300600kms@xmath4 , which is not observed .",
    "models in which gas flows out preferentially along the edges of the cone are also consistent with the data , but are outside the scope of this letter . in summary ,",
    "the simple momentum - driven biconical wind model is able to reproduce the velocities of the hv components toward .",
    "the _ hst_/cos spectrum of , a qso lying only 15.2  from the gc in a direction of enhanced x - ray and @xmath6-ray emission intercepting the base of the northern fb , shows uv metal - absorption - line components at @xmath2=@xmath3235 and + 250kms@xmath4  ( corresponding to @xmath21=190 and + 295kms@xmath4 ) , velocities which can not be explained by gas in the low halo of the inner galaxy co - rotating with the disk .",
    "a further component at + 130kms@xmath4  is also difficult to explain via co - rotation .",
    "none of the components shows 21 cm emission in our gbt spectrum down to sensitive levels of @xmath14()@xmath183.3@xmath1510@xmath16@xmath17  ( 3@xmath13 ) , which indicates the hydrogen is mostly ionized .",
    "the kinematics of these components can be explained in a scenario where cool swept - up gas is entrained on the near- ( blueshifted ) and far- ( redshifted ) side of a biconical outflow from the gc .",
    "there are several arguments supporting the biconical outflow explanation : ( 1 ) the _ rosat _ x - ray imaging and _ fermi _ @xmath6-ray imaging both clearly indicate the presence of a biconical structure centered on the gc and intersected by the  sightline ; ( 2 ) simple kinematic models of a biconical outflow ( section 4 ) naturally reproduce the presence of both negative- and positive - velocity gas components ; ( 3 ) such models also explain the excess low - velocity high - ion absorption ; ( 4 ) the mg13 results demonstrate a population of  clumps existing closer to the gc with kinematics consistent with a biconical outflow ; ( 5 ) although we can not rule out the possibility that individual hv absorbers arise in unrelated foreground or background hvcs , which have a sky covering fraction in uv metal lines of @xmath06880% @xcite , a _ chance alignment _ of two unrelated hvcs at close - to - symmetric velocities of @xmath3235 and + 250kms@xmath4   would be needed to emulate the profiles of a biconical outflow ; ( 6 ) given the low latitude of the  sightline ( @xmath23=+11.2 ) , explaining the @xmath3235 and + 250kms@xmath4  components as being regular ( non - gc ) hvcs would require unusually large ( @xmath51000kms@xmath4 ) vertical inflow or outflow velocities , because of the projection factor sin @xmath23 .",
    "this makes it highly unlikely that the  hv components are due to regular hvcs or to tidally - stripped material like the magellanic stream , which have much lower vertical flow velocities ( @xmath28100200kms@xmath4 ) .    in the biconical outflow interpretation ,",
    "the hot wind phase is feeding the fbs with new plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the cool low - ion gas represents swept - up material entrained in the outflow .",
    "we stress that our _ hst_/cos observations do not directly probe the hot phase , but instead probe cool ( @xmath29k ) entrained gas via the low ions and transition - temperature ( @xmath30k ) gas via the high ions , which may trace the boundaries between the cool gas and the hot wind .",
    "the cool outflowing gas has already been detected , albeit closer to the gc with a much lower wind velocity , via the mg13 population of  clouds . despite the disruptive instabilities that can destroy cold filaments and clouds on short timescales ,",
    "simulations show that such structures can survive in the hot wind fluid if stabilized by magnetic fields or other mechanisms @xcite .",
    "our models find the outflow velocity is @xmath5900kms@xmath4 ; such a flow must be @xmath02.54.0myr old to reach 2.3kpc , the impact parameter of the  sightline .",
    "this wind age is consistent with the timescale of energy injection that created the fbs , whether via agn jets @xcite , feedback from nuclear star formation @xcite , accretion flows onto sgra@xmath31 @xcite , or a spherical outflow from sgra@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it is also compatible with the observed h@xmath26 emission from the magellanic stream , which is consistent with an origin following a seyfert flare at the gc 13myr ago @xcite . in our upcoming work",
    ", we will analyze the uv spectra of other gc targets , including foreground stars at a range of distance and background agn at a range of latitude , both inside and outside the fbs . a large sample of sightlines is needed to fully characterize the extent and nature of the galactic nuclear outflow .",
