    "optical spin injection and detection are very efficient due to well - established spin selection rules.@xcite the transport of spin can be studied directly with high temporal and spatial resolution .",

    ", the optically injected holes quickly lose their polarization and recombine with majority carriers , leaving behind a purely electronic spin packet.@xcite in intrinsic samples with an externally applied electric field , holes are spatially separated from the electrons , and the transport is dominated by drift of spin - polarized electrons in the field.@xcite in spin - grating experiments , interference of two oppositely polarized laser beams results in polarization modulation  without intensity modulation , across the laser spot  which is typically much bigger than the grating period . since the excited carrier density is uniform , no carrier diffusion occurs .",
    "spin diffusion in this configuration is not influenced by holes.@xcite finally , in spin - transport experiments using surface acoustic waves , spatially modulated piezoelectric fields of surface acoustic waves separate and move spin - polarized carriers . since electrons and holes are trapped at the minima and maxima of the acoustic wave , respectively , holes are separated from electrons over macroscopic distances.@xcite in all these cases , since the influence of the holes is suppressed , spin transport is dominated by the drift and diffusion of spin - polarized electrons , analog to unipolar carrier transport .    ) and holes ( @xmath0 ) are injected in gaas qws by a circularly polarized pump pulse . right after the hole spin relaxation , the carrier system is composed of spin - up electrons , spin - down electrons , and holes , within the excitation spot .",

    "a portion of the transmitted probe pulse is reflected by a beam splitter to a silicon photodiode to detect electron density .",
    "the spin density is detected by analyzing the polarization state of the other portion of the transmitted probe pulse by an optical bridge composed of a quarter - wave plate ( @xmath1 ) , a wollaston prism , and a balanced detector.,width=283 ]    in this paper , we report theoretical and experimental studies of diffusion of optically injected spin - polarized carriers in an intrinsic semiconductor without an externally applied electric field . in this case , the spin diffusion is strongly influenced by the presence of the holes . in the experiments ,",
    "spin - polarized electron - hole pairs are excited in gaas quantum wells ( qws ) by a tightly focused and circularly polarized laser pulse .",
    "since hole spin relaxation is shorter than a few picoseconds,@xcite after a short transient process , the carrier system has three components , spin - up electrons , spin - down electrons , and holes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "all three species diffuse in the quantum - well plane and interact with each other .",
    "figure 1b illustrates the carrier system at a later time .",
    "although holes are unpolarized , they influence the diffusion of spin - polarized electrons via the coulomb attraction .",
    "basically , the rate of diffusion is controlled by the slow holes , while the highly mobile electrons quickly adjust to neutralize the holes .",
    "this forces both spin - up and spin - down electrons to diffuse in the same direction , in marked opposition to unipolar spin packets in which electrons of opposite spin orientations diffuse in opposite directions .",
    "we study this triple - polar diffusion process by a pump - probe technique .",
    "dynamics of electron density and spin density are spatially and temporally resolved by measuring carrier - induced changes in the transmission of a linearly polarized probe pulse [ fig .",
    "we observe a sub - linear - expansion process of the area of the spin density packet , while the simultaneously measured electron density packet expands linearly .",
    "this indicates that the spin transport can not be described as a classical diffusion process with a constant diffusion coefficient .",
    "the spin diffusion is significantly slower than the ambipolar carrier diffusion i.e. , diffusion of holes screened by electrons .",
    "our theoretical analysis , based on a three - component drift - diffusion equation , shows that the long - time behavior of the spin density can be understood in terms of a spin relaxation rate that grows with decreasing density .",
    "this behavior is consistent with a model of dyakonov - perel relaxation limited by the coulomb scattering between the carriers .",
    "however , the short - time behavior of the diffusion , where the spin diffusion coefficient decreases significantly with time , remains for the time being beyond the reach of our drift - diffusion theory , and will be the subject of further investigation .",

    "the sample is cooled to 80  k. spin - polarized carriers are excited by a circularly polarized 250-fs pump pulse with a central wavelength of 1550  nm obtained from an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a ti : sapphire laser at 80  mhz .",
    "the circular polarization is achieved by a broadband quarter - wave plate and a linear polarizer , with a purity better than 97% on the sample .",
    "the pump pulse is tightly focused to excite carriers with a gaussian spatial profile of @xmath3=1.5  @xmath4 m ( full width at half maxima ) through two - photon absorption , with an excitation excess energy of about 40  mev .",
    "the density of spin - up electrons excited , @xmath5 , is approximately three times higher than the density of spin - down electrons , @xmath6 , owing to selection rules for two - photon absorption of circularly polarized light.@xcite the advantage of using two - photon absorption process instead of one - photon absorption to excite carriers is that , due to a small two - photon absorption coefficient , the peak electron density is uniform across the quantum wells since the intensity of the pump pulse does not attenuate significantly as it propagates through the sample .",
    "the carrier and spin dynamics are monitored by simultaneously measuring electron and spin density profiles as functions of time by using a spatially and temporally resolved pump - probe technique .",
    "the total electron density , @xmath7 , is measured by focusing a linearly polarized 100-fs probe pulse on the sample with a spot size of 1.5  @xmath4 m [ fig .",
    "the probe pulse is obtained from the ti : sapphire laser that is used to pump the optical parametric oscillator , and is tuned to @xmath8 heavy - hole excitonic resonance ( 803  nm ) to efficiently probe carriers based on well - established excitonic absorption saturation caused by free carriers.@xcite the differential transmission , @xmath9/t_0 $ ] , i.e. , the normalized difference between transmission in the presence of carriers [ @xmath10 and without them [ @xmath11 , is measured by reflecting a portion of the transmitted probe pulse to a silicon photodiode [ see fig .",
    "this quantity is directly proportional to the electron density under our experimental conditions ( see discussion below ) . a lock - in amplifier",
    "is used to detect the signal with the pump intensity modulated at 821  hz by a mechanical chopper .",
    "spin density , @xmath12 , is measured by analyzing carrier - induced circular dichroism of the same probe pulse , i.e. , the absorption difference of right- and left - hand circularly polarized probe pulses in the presence of spin - polarized carriers .",
    "the linearly - polarized probe pulse is composed of two circular components . due to",
    "spin - selection rules , each component preferentially senses one spin system.@xcite by using a quarter - wave plate ( @xmath13 ) , the two circular components are converted to two orthogonal linear polarizations , which are then separated by a wollaston prism and sent to two photodiodes of a balanced detector .",
    "the output of the balanced detector is proportional to the difference between the differential transmissions of the two circular components , @xmath14 , which is proportional to the spin density @xmath15.@xcite    in order to deduce the actual electron and spin densities from the measured differential transmission signals @xmath16 and @xmath14 , separate measurements are performed with the same set - up , but with a pump pulse of a central wavelength at 775  nm , which is obtained by the second - harmonic generation of the 1550-nm pulse .",
    "this pump pulse excites carriers via one - photon absorption . the linear relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "is verified by measuring @xmath16 as a function of the energy fluence of this pump pulse , which is proportional to the electron density in the linear regime .",
    "furthermore , we measure the absorption coefficient of the sample at this pump wavelength by comparing the incident , reflected , and transmitted powers of the pump pulse .",
    "this allows us to determine the number of photons absorbed by the sample for a given pump energy fluence .",
    "since other absorption processes are much weaker than the interband absorption , approximately the same number of carriers is excited .",
    "therefore , we obtain the proportionality constant between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the constant of proportionality between the spin density @xmath15 and @xmath14 is similarly deduced , using in addition the well - established fact that the one - photon absorption of circularly polarized light tuned close to the band gap of gaas excites electrons with a spin polarization of @xmath18.@xcite",

    "it is worth mentioning that , in the experiment , due to a finite size of the probe spot , the measured profiles shown in fig .",
    "2b are actually convolutions of the probe spot and the actual electron density profiles .",

    "the decrease in the slope with time is more pronounced at higher densities .",
    "meanwhile , the simultaneously obtained expansions of the electron density profile ( not shown ) are all linear and similar to fig .  2c . to approximately compare the rates of spin diffusion and carrier diffusion , we perform linear fits to the data with @xmath27 ps ( solid lines in fig .  3 ) .",

    "for the present experiment the expected value of @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "the number of spin - up electrons is three times larger than the number of spin - down electrons , owing to selection rules for two - photon absorption of circularly polarized light.@xcite then , _ if the spin relaxation time is neglected _ we see immediately  by direct substitution  that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ spe_asym_s_dd_ud2 ] ) is @xmath70 in other words , the spin density and the ordinary density diffuse at exactly the same rate , controlled by @xmath25 .",
    "it should be noted that this result holds irrespective of the value of the spin coulomb drag coefficient .",
    "the ambipolar spin diffusion in our configuration is in sharp contrast with the case of _ unipolar _ spin packets in spin - grating experiments.@xcite in those experiments , two laser pulses that are oppositely linearly polarized are used to excited carriers .",
    "since the interference does not introduce any intensity modulation of the light , the total electron density and hole density excited are not modulated .",
    "hence , there is no density gradient to cause diffusion of holes and electrons .",
    "however , the interference gives rise to spatial modulations of the light _",
    "polarization _ , resulting in periodic variations in spin density of electrons .",
    "the excited spin grating decays due to the diffusion of spin - up and spin - down electrons from high density to low density regions , within the laser spot . in this case , the same theory predicts the spin diffusion constant to be @xmath71 , given by eq .",
    "( [ spindiffusionconstant]).@xcite in this _ unipolar _ spin diffusion regime , the requirement of charge neutrality forces the electrons of opposite spin orientations to move in opposite directions : spin coulomb drag arises from this relative motion . in the ambipolar spin- diffusion process , the spin - density profile overlaps with the hole density profile , and charge neutrality is ensured by the holes .",
    "thus , the electrons move in the same direction regardless of spin - there is no relative motion and therefore no spin coulomb drag , and the diffusion is controlled by the ambipolar diffusion coefficient .",
    "the above solution  ( [ solutiontrivial ] ) was found for the initial condition  ( [ initialcondition1 ] ) but we have checked that , even if the spin density is not initially proportional to the density , it eventually becomes proportional to the density at sufficiently long times .",
    "we conclude that the experimental observation of an apparently decreasing spin diffusion coefficient can not be explained within the framework of the drift - diffusion theory , unless one is willing to include the spin relaxation time .",
    "further , it is easy to see that a _ homogeneous _",
    "spin relaxation time ( @xmath53 independent of density and hence of position ) will not change the situation , for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ spe_asym_s_dd_ud2 ] ) in the presence of such a relaxation time is simply @xmath72 there is now decay of the spin due to spin relaxation in addition to the global decay of carrier and spin densities due to electron - hole recombination .",
    "in view of the above discussion , we now examine the possibility of explaining the experimental data in terms of non - homogeneous spin relaxation .",
    "suppose , for instance , that the spin relaxation rate were larger at lower density , i.e. , larger in the tails of the spin packet than at its center .",
    "this would produce the impression of slower spin diffusion , since the outward diffusion of the spin would be hidden by the more rapid decay of the spin at the edges ( fig .",
    "5 ) . to verify this idea ,",
    "we measure the spin relaxation time as a function of peak electron density by using the same pump - probe technique . the results shown in fig .  7 confirm this conjecture ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the spin relaxation time is larger for packets of higher density , suggesting that @xmath53 increases with decreasing density .",
    "however , these are measurements of the lifetime of the spin packet as a whole , whereas in the drift - diffusion theory we need a position - dependent spin relaxation rate , determined by the local density .     for illustrative purposes only),width=302 ]    we have developed a model for the position dependence of the spin relaxation rate along the following lines .",
    "first , we notice that electron - impurity effects or spin - orbit interactions with the lattice could not account for the spatial variation of @xmath53 within the packet , since the impurity environment and the crystalline environment are uniform over the region occupied by the packet .",
    "what is not uniform is the frequency of electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - hole ( e - h ) collisions .",
    "because the coulomb interaction is screened and thus effectively becomes of short range , we can say that the carriers near the center of the packet experience an electronic environment of higher density , and their scattering rate is accordingly higher than in the tails of the packet , where they experience an electronic environment of lower density .",
    "how does the variation in the carrier - carrier scattering time translate into the observed spatial variation in the spin relaxation rate ?",
    "a plausible answer comes from the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism.@xcite in this mechanism , the spin relaxation is primarily due to the spin - orbit interaction with the lattice . in gaas",
    "the primary mechanism is the independent precession of each electron in the dresselhaus @xmath73-dependent effective magnetic field@xcite @xmath74 where the parameter @xmath75 for gaas , @xmath76 is the effective mass of electrons in the conduction band , and @xmath77 is the band - gap energy .",
    "notice that the effective magnetic field depends on the momentum @xmath78 of the electron .",
    "e - e and e - h collisions change the momentum of the electron , and thus change the direction and magnitude of @xmath79 .",
    "this hinders the process of spin relaxation , especially in regions where momentum - changing collisions are frequent , i.e. high - density regions .",
    "a standard analysis for cubic systems leads to the conclusion that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is related to the momentum relaxation time by the effectiveness of the scattering event on the randomization of the axis of @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the component of @xmath84 perpendicular to the spin axis , @xmath85 is the one - particle energy , and the angular bracket denotes a thermal average in momentum space .",

    "this is admittedly a significant approximation as the electrons are degenerate above @xmath93@xmath86 .",
    "while numerical accuracy may be improved , qualitative aspects are generalizable .",
    "our results are shown in fig .  6 , where the momentum relaxation times due to e - e and e - h scatterings are compared to the background scattering due to impurities , which is density independent .",
    "these values have been obtained for a typical thermal value of @xmath94 m@xmath88 with a screening wave vector of @xmath89 m@xmath88 . applying matthiessen s rule ,",

    "( [ dpformula ] ) is being applied on a microscopic scale . at this point ,",
    "the earlier approximation of a spatially uniform @xmath37 can be justified .",
    "whereas the range in spin relaxation time for @xmath96 varies by as much as 600 ps , the electron - hole recombination time only varies by 30 ps . clearly , the spatial dependence of the recombination rate is swamped off by the spatial dependence of the spin relaxation .",

    "the spin diffusion rates with and without spin coulomb drag are also compared .",
    "the differences are rather small , reflecting the fact that the slowing down of the spin is mostly apparent , i.e. due to the loss of spin in the edges rather than to the relative motion between up and down spin components .",
    "nonetheless , a small effect is visible and goes in the direction of further reducing the apparent spin diffusion .",
