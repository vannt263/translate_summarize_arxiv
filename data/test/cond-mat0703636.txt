    "idealized models of random networks provide an important tool for characterizing real - world networks such as communication , infrastructure , and social networks @xcite . for example",
    ", the emergence of hubs in heterogeneous networks is a consequence of a `` rich - gets - richer '' mechanism .",
    "this phenomenon arises in networks that grow via preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "most network growth models are based upon sequential addition of nodes and subsequent attachment to existing nodes according to a prescribed mechanism .",
    "this framework does not allow for removal of nodes .",
    "in reality , there are two types of networks .",
    "one type of networks including for example citation networks may only expand , while another type of networks such as friendship networks may either expand or contract .",
    "indeed , individuals may join or leave a social group @xcite .",
    "the same is true for technological networks such as the world - wide - web because websites may disappear .",
    "there is substantial theoretical understanding of the structure of strictly expanding networks , but much less is known about networks that may also contract @xcite . in the latter case , it is typically impossible to construct closed equations for quantities such as the degree distribution because removal of nodes generates memory or correlations .    in this paper , we introduce a simple network growth process with addition and deletion of nodes and show that it is possible to obtain closed equations for several structural properties of the network . in our growing network model , nodes may be added or deleted .",
    "when a node is added to the network , it is attached to a randomly selected existing node .",
    "when a node is deleted , its daughters are attached to its parent .",
    "this process is relevant for phylogenetic trees , namely trees that document the ancestries of distinct biological species @xcite because in the process of evolution , mutation events generate new nodes while extinction events result in deletion of existing nodes @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the in - component size distribution and show that this quantity obeys a closed evolution equation .",
    "we analytically obtain many characteristics of this distribution including the generating function , the moments , and the tail behavior .",
    "the in - component size distribution decays algebraically and the characteristic exponent varies continuously with the addition rate .",
    "such behavior is in contrast with preferential attachment networks where this exponent is fixed .",
    "next , we obtain closed equations for the height distribution that characterizes the distance between a node and the root .",
    "this distribution obeys poisson statistics .",
    "other structural characteristics such as the diameter of the network and the degree of the most connected node follow directly from this quantity .",
    "in general , deletion leads to a condensation phenomena where a single node is connected to a finite fraction of all nodes , while the rest of the nodes have only a finite degree .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the addition - deletion process is introduced in section ii .",
    "the in - component size distribution and related quantities such as the fraction of dangling nodes are discussed in section iii .",
    "next , in section iv , the height distribution and related quantities including the diameter are described .",
    "the degree distribution is analyzed using an approximate theory and numerical simulations in section v. section vi contains a brief summary .",
    "finally , appendices [ alpha ] and [ aggr ] contain several technical derivations .",
    "in the addition - deletion process , initially there is one seed node , and then , the network grows via addition of nodes and shrinks via deletion of nodes as follows .    1 .   * the addition process . * with rate @xmath0",
    ", a new node is added and it links to a randomly selected node ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is an egalitarian attachment process as the new node is equally likely to link to any one of the existing nodes .",
    "2 .   * the deletion process . * with rate @xmath1 , a randomly selected node ( together with its outgoing link ) is deleted .",
    "the parent of the deleted node inherits all the incoming links of the deleted node ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this inheritance mechanism preserves ancestral relations as is the case in phylogenetic trees : when a species goes extinct , its immediate descendants are linked to its immediate ancestor .",
    "we stress that the addition process and the deletion process are completely independent of each other and that in the deletion process all links are removed with an equal probability .",
    "this addition - deletion process preserves the complexity of the graph since nodes and links are added and deleted in pairs .",
    "thus , starting with a single seed node and no links , the network has a tree structure .",
    "the seed node can not be deleted ( or the ancestry would be destroyed ) and therefore , the seed is the root of the tree .",
    "the average total number of nodes at time @xmath5 , @xmath6 , evolves according to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , this quantity grows linearly with time and since @xmath8 , @xmath9 the total number of links , @xmath10 , follows from @xmath11 and therefore , @xmath12 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the case of growing networks , @xmath13 . in this case",
    ", the size of the network increases indefinitely with time and fluctuations are negligible in the long time limit .",
    "the total number of nodes grows diffusively and is subject to large fluctuations in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the in - component of a node @xmath15 is the set of all nodes which are connected to @xmath15 via a path of directed links . in the context of a phylogenetic tree ,",
    "the in - component is simply the set of all descendants .",
    "let @xmath16 be the average number of nodes with an in - component of size @xmath17 .",
    "in our definition , the in - component includes the node itself , and therefore @xmath18 .",
    "the in - component size distribution evolves according to @xmath19 \\!+\\!\\frac{k}{l}\\left[c_{k+1}\\!-\\!c_k\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first three terms correspond to changes caused by node addition .",
    "new nodes generate a new in - component of size one and thus , the first term . in - components",
    "grow by one when a node links to any of the nodes in that in - component and the next two terms account for this augmentation .",
    "the corresponding attachment rate is the addition rate @xmath0 normalized by the total number of links @xmath20 .",
    "the last two terms correspond to node deletion .",
    "deletion of any one of the @xmath17 links in an in - component of size @xmath21 generates an in - component of size @xmath17 and hence the gain term .",
    "similarly , deletion of any one of the @xmath17 nodes in an in - component of size @xmath17 decreases the in - component size by one and hence the loss term .",
    "all nodes except for the root may be deleted and accordingly , the deletion rate is normalized by the total number of links @xmath22 . by summing equations ( [ ck - eq ] )",
    "one can verify that the total number of nodes @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in the long time asymptotics where the difference between the total number of nodes and the total number of links is negligible .",
    "therefore , we replace @xmath22 with @xmath20 in ( [ ck - eq ] ) .",
    "we also make the transformation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fraction of nodes with in - component degree equal to @xmath17 and @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath26 satisfies the difference equation @xmath28\\!+\\!k(c_{k+1}\\!-\\!c_k).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the tail of this distribution can be obtained using a continuum approximation , that is , through replacement of differences with derivatives : @xmath29 , etc .",
    "this change transforms the difference equation ( [ ck - eq ] ) into the differential equation @xmath30 the solution of this equi - dimensional equation is a power - law @xmath31 as @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the in - component size distribution has a power - law tail .",
    "the exponent @xmath32 varies continuously with the addition rate .",
    "the characteristic exponent is minimal , @xmath33 , for the well - understood case of random recursive trees ( @xmath34 ) where deletion is irrelevant @xcite .",
    "the exponent diverges in the more interesting limit of marginally growing networks ( @xmath14 ) where deletion is as strong as addition .",
    "addition - deletion networks differ from strictly growing networks where the exponent characterizing the in - component size distribution is independent of the details of the attachment mechanism , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus the deletion process qualitatively changes the network structure .",
    "the moments provide complementary information about the in - component size distribution . of course ,",
    "the first moment satisfies @xmath36 as seen by summing .",
    "equation describes the evolution as a function of the total number of nodes rather than time .",
    "since we are interested in the asymptotic behavior , we again replace @xmath22 with @xmath20 in ( [ ck - eq ] ) . solving eq .",
    "( [ m1-eq ] ) , we find that the first moment is proportional to the number of nodes , .",
    "hence the average in - component size is linear in the addition rate , .    similarly , the second moment obeys @xmath37 there are three types of asymptotic behavior @xmath38 the proportionality constant @xmath39 depends on the initial conditions .",
    "these asymptotic behaviors are consistent with the algebraic decay ( [ beta ] ) : the second moment grows linearly when @xmath40 , it increases super - linearly when @xmath41 , and it acquires a logarithmic correction in the marginal case @xmath42 .",
    "the generating function @xmath43 contains complete information about the in - component size distribution .",
    "normalization implies @xmath44 and since @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ck - eq ] ) by @xmath47 and summing over @xmath17 , we arrive at a first order differential equation for the generating function @xmath48 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath49 . the homogeneous part of equation admits the solution @xmath50 .",
    "we make the transformation when , and then the auxiliary function @xmath51 satisfies .",
    "integration of this equation yields the generating function @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the lower limit of integration was chosen to assure that @xmath54 is finite .",
    "one can verify that in agreement with the normalization requirement .",
    "a similar calculation gives the generating function in the range @xmath55",
    "@xmath56    the large-@xmath17 behavior is encoded in the @xmath57 behavior of the generating function .",
    "first , we confirm the power - law tail ( [ beta ] ) by using ( [ fx - sol - a ] ) .",
    "second , we obtain the corresponding proportionality constant @xmath58 the appendix details the analysis leading to this result .     versus inverse of the addition rate @xmath59 ( solid line ) .",
    "also shown is the large-@xmath0 asymptotic behavior @xmath60 ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    conversely , the small-@xmath17 behavior is reflected by the @xmath61 behavior of the generating function .",
    "the fraction of dangling nodes , that is , nodes with no incoming links , is given by @xmath62 and by differentiation of the generating function ( [ fx - sol - b ] ) we readily find @xmath63 the integral can be expressed via the hypergeometric function , @xmath64 , or alternatively as the power series @xmath65 .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 is a monotonically decreasing function of the addition rate @xmath0 and is roughly linear in @xmath59 ( figure [ fig - dangling ] ) .",
    "it is maximal for marginally growing networks ( see subsection a below ) , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the exponential integral @xcite .",
    "the fraction of dangling nodes is minimal for random recursive trees , @xmath69 .",
    "in general , over half of the nodes are dangling nodes .",
    "the in - component size distribution can be calculated recursively for small @xmath17 by using , , etc .",
    "we now investigate the limits @xmath14 and @xmath70 in detail .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ ck - eq ] ) becomes @xmath71 for marginally growing networks ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "repeating the steps leading to ( [ ck - eq - cont ] ) yields the second order linear differential equation @xmath72 the tail of the in - component size distribution has a stretched exponential tail @xmath73 a result that can be obtained using the wkb technique .",
    "this sharp decay is consistent with the divergent @xmath74 .    to find the generating function , we repeat the steps leading to ( [ fx - sol - a ] ) .",
    "the governing equation ( [ fx - eq ] ) becomes @xmath75 , and the solution of this equation is .",
    "the generating function can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral @xmath76 from which the fraction of dangling nodes ( [ c1-sol-1 ] ) follows .",
    "the second limiting case , @xmath34 , corresponds to random recursive trees .",
    "now , the in - component size distribution satisfies the recursion equation @xmath77 unlike in the general case , this simpler equation can be solved recursively starting at @xmath78 : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , etc .",
    "we thus recover the well - known result @xcite @xmath82 alternatively , one can obtain the distribution from the generating function @xmath83 .",
    "another important structural characteristic is the height of a node , that is , the number of links separating a given node from the root @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 be the average number of nodes with height @xmath17 at time @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity evolves according to @xmath85 for @xmath18 .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath86 and the boundary conditions are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the first term on the right - hand side accounts for gain due to node addition and the next two terms describe changes due to node deletion .",
    "the factor @xmath17 reflects that deletion of a node of height @xmath17 reduces the heights of all of its descendants by one .",
    "again , the addition and the deletion rates are normalized by the total number of nodes and the total number of links , respectively .",
    "one can verify that the total number of nodes @xmath89 satisfies .    following the above analysis of the in - component size distribution ,",
    "we study the long time asymptotic behavior of @xmath90 , the fraction of nodes with height @xmath17 , using the transformation @xmath91 normalization implies @xmath92 and the boundary condition is now @xmath93 since @xmath87 .",
    "let us substitute ( [ hk - def ] ) into the rate equation ( [ hkt - eq ] ) .",
    "the distribution function @xmath90 satisfies the recursion relation @xmath94 this equation was obtained by adding @xmath95 to both side of ( [ hkt - eq ] ) .    in this case , it is convenient to use the exponential generating function , defined via @xmath96 multiplication of the recursion relation ( [ hk - eq ] ) by @xmath97 and summation over @xmath17 leads to the first order ordinary differential equation @xmath98 the generating function is found by integration of this equation subject to the boundary condition @xmath99 , @xmath100 using the definition we find that the height distribution function is poissonian @xmath101    the moments of the height distribution can be found by differentiation of the generating function ( [ gz ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 , and therefore the average node height is equal to the average in - component size , @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , fluctuations in the height are obtained from the second moment @xmath104 , and hence , the variance is @xmath105 this variance is sufficient to characterize the behavior in the vicinity of the average , where the poissonian height distribution becomes gaussian .",
    "we can immediately deduce a number of characteristics using the height distribution .",
    "there are @xmath106 nodes at height @xmath17 with incoming links from the @xmath95 nodes at height @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the average in - degree @xmath107 of nodes at height @xmath17 is @xmath108 . using @xmath87 and ( [ hk - sol ] ) we find @xmath109 the second result shows that the average degree is inversely proportional to the height .",
    "the root , with its macroscopic degree , is the most connected node whereas all other nodes have a microscopic degree .",
    "hence , the root is a giant hub .",
    "the degree of the root is maximal for marginally growing networks , @xmath110 , and it decreases indefinitely as @xmath0 increases .",
    "therefore , deletion must be responsible for this condensation phenomena .",
    "indeed , since the attachment rate to each node is @xmath111 , addition can be responsible for at most @xmath112 of the @xmath113 connections as is the case for random recursive trees @xcite .",
    "we conclude that emergence of the giant hub is due to deletion .",
    "consider now the highest node .",
    "the maximal height @xmath114 is determined from the extreme statistics criterion @xmath115 . using the poisson distribution ( [ hk - sol ] ) and the stirling formula @xmath116",
    ", the highest node grows very slowly with the network size , @xmath117 .",
    "remarkably , the maximal height is independent of the addition rate @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotically , the diameter of the network @xmath118 is twice the maximal height @xmath119 for strictly growing random trees , the diameter exhibits a logarithmic growth independent of the attachment mechanism , @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "however , the diameter can be affected by the topology .",
    "if every new node links to @xmath121 existing nodes , this strictly growing network is no longer a tree ( for @xmath122 ) and @xmath123 .",
    "this result @xcite is again very robust , namely it holds for strictly growing networks with reasonable attachment mechanisms and for all @xmath122 .",
    "equation shows that deletion qualitatively affects the growth of the diameter .",
    "surprisingly , despite their distinct topologies these strictly growing networks and the addition - deletion networks have similar diameters .",
    "finally , we address the average distance between two nodes , @xmath124 . since the degree of the root is proportional to the total number of nodes @xmath20 , a path connecting two randomly selected nodes almost surely includes the root . as a result ,",
    "the average distance is asymptotically equal to twice the average height @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast with the in - component size distribution and the height distribution , it is impossible to construct closed equations for the degree distribution and we perform an approximate analysis .    when a node with in - degree @xmath126 is deleted , the in - degree of the parent @xmath127 is augmented by @xmath128 .",
    "this is simply the aggregation process @xcite @xmath129 the aggregation rate is proportional to the in - degree of the parent node because any of the daughter nodes can be deleted .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath130 reflects that the probability of picking the deleted node is inversely proportional to the number of nodes and the probability of picking the parent node is inversely proportional to the number of links .",
    "let @xmath131 be the average number of nodes with in - degree @xmath17 at time @xmath5 ( the out - degree is always one ) .",
    "the total number of nodes and the total number of links are given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the degrees of neighboring nodes are completely uncorrelated , the quantity @xmath134 obeys the nonlinear rate equation @xcite @xmath135.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial condition is @xmath136 and the boundary condition is @xmath137 .",
    "the first three terms represent addition events .",
    "these terms are linear and thus , exact .",
    "the last three terms account for deletion events .",
    "these terms are non - linear as they represent two node interactions .",
    "moreover , the gain term has a convolution structure , reflecting the aggregation process .",
    "of course , the aggregation process becomes exact in the limit @xmath34 where deletion becomes irrelevant . by summation of the rate equation",
    "we recover @xmath138 .",
    "following our above analysis , we study the fraction of nodes with in - degree @xmath17 , @xmath139 . making the transformation @xmath140 , the degree distribution satisfies",
    "@xmath141 we analyze this hierarchy of equations using the generating function @xmath142 .",
    "the normalizations @xmath143 imply . by multiplying the recursive equations by @xmath47 and summing over @xmath17",
    ", we find that the generating function obeys the nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath144 this equation is consistent with the normalization conditions .     nodes and @xmath145 .",
    "roughly 90% of the nodes have a degree smaller or than .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the moments of the degree distribution defined by @xmath146 are obtained by successive differentiation of the generating function . in particular , the high - order moments grow rapidly although they do remain finite ( appendix b ) @xmath147^n ( n!)^2,\\ ] ] as @xmath148 . using these asymptotics we deduce ( see appendix b ) that the tail of the degree - distribution decays as a stretched exponential @xmath149 with @xmath150/\\sqrt{r}$ ] .    how well does this approximation compare with addition - deletion networks ?",
    "in addition - deletion networks , the root has a macroscopic degree .",
    "in other words , it is a condensate that contains a finite fraction of all nodes . in the aggregation process ( [ agg ] )",
    "all clusters are finite , as seen from @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that all nodes are treated in the same way . introducing a fixed node that can not be deleted",
    "should significantly improve the approximation .",
    "we also examined the degree distribution using monte carlo simulations of the aggregation process ( [ agg ] ) and the addition - deletion process .",
    "we find that when the degree is very small , the aggregation process approximates the addition - deletion process very well ( figure [ fig - ak ] ) . for small degree",
    "this agreement holds independent of @xmath0 . however , this approximation is poor when the degree is large .",
    "for addition - deletion networks , the degree distribution follows a power law behavior ( figure [ fig - tail ] ) @xmath152 as @xmath3 .",
    "hence , degree - degree correlations are negligible for small degrees but substantial for large degrees .",
    "indeed , highly connected nodes are long lived and thus , involve strong memory .",
    "independent realizations in a network with @xmath153 nodes and @xmath145 .",
    "the decay exponent is @xmath154,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    addition - deletion network can be simulated using an efficient algorithm that is linear in the network size . throughout the growth process",
    "we keep track of all nodes , whether they have been deleted ( passive nodes ) or not ( active nodes ) . in an addition event",
    ", an active node is added and it links to a randomly selected active node . in a deletion event , an active node is marked passive .",
    "when the required network size is reached , passive nodes are removed in reverse chronological order to preserve the ancestral relations .",
    "simulations of the aggregation process are performed as follows .",
    "the system consists of aggregates , each with a given size . in an addition step",
    ", an aggregate of size zero is added and simultaneously , the size of another , randomly chosen aggregate increases by one . in a deletion step",
    "one aggregate is chosen with probability proportional to its size and it merges with another randomly chosen aggregate according to ( [ agg ] ) .",
    "we have studied networks which undergo a biased growth  new nodes are added at a certain rate and old nodes are deleted at a smaller rate in such a way that the ancestry is preserved .",
    "this growing network model is relevant to biological and technological networks that preserve ancestral relations between nodes .",
    "our main conclusion is that it is possible to characterize the structure of such networks analytically .",
    "for instance , the in - component size distribution has a power - law tail and the characteristic exponent varies continuously with the addition rate .",
    "we have also shown that the height distribution obeys poisson statistics .",
    "additional properties including the fraction of dangling nodes and the average degree as a function of height have been obtained as well .",
    "interestingly , the addition - deletion process results in a giant hub that is connected to a finite fraction of the nodes in the system .",
    "this fraction decreases to zero as deletion becomes weaker , showing that the deletion process causes this condensation phenomena .",
    "we have also seen that the degree distribution evolves by an aggregation process since the parent node inherits all incoming links of a deleted node . treating the underlying aggregation process as completely random",
    "is valid only at small degrees because degree - degree correlations become significant at large degrees .",
    "constructing closed equations for this aggregation process from which the degree distribution can be calculated is an outstanding challenge .",
