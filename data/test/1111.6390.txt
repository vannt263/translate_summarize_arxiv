    "this interference is analogous to the interference between two lasers at different frequencies : interference fringes are observed provided that the time window of the detector is sufficiently small so not to resolve the detuning between the lasers @xcite . as in the case of two independent lasers ,",
    "there is no well defined phase offset : the relative phase is defined only for a single experimental run , while the average over a statistically significant number of runs gives no interference pattern @xcite .",
    "differing from the situation of two laser beams @xcite , however , photon scattering here creates correlations among the scattered photon , the corresponding outcoupled atom , and the quantum gas .",
    "this correlation is a form of a which - way information , that in general washes out any interference in the photon flux @xcite and can be considered as a form of photon - atoms entanglement @xcite .",
    "oscillations in the photon flux , and hence interference , can be recovered if ( i ) the beam of atoms outcoupled from one well overlap spatially with the wave function of the atoms in the second trap and ( ii ) if there are either initial correlations between the atoms in the two wells or if they both possess a non - vanishing condensate fraction .    condition ( i ) corresponds to a quantum eraser @xcite : when it is fulfilled , in fact , the outcoupled atom is no more entangled with the scattered photon .",
    "we will see in the following that it can be fulfilled for certain geometries and after a certain time , corresponding to the time needed for the outcoupled atoms to travel to the second well .    condition ( i ) alone is however not sufficient .",
    "the photon is not only correlated with the outcoupled atom , but also with the scattering system .",
    "therefore , only when either the atoms in left and right system are correlated ( via e.g. tunneling events which may wash out the which - way information @xcite ) or when these correlations are partly classical , as it occurs when there is a finite condensate fraction in both systems , then interference can be reestablished .",

    ", they have been discussed in terms of josephson junction , taking into account the possibility that the outcoupled atoms from one condensate can be then retrapped in the second well by means of an inverse raman process .",
    "the discussion we just reported provides a quantum optical interpretation of the phenomenon , that is valid for short times , when the quantum state of the scattering atoms is not substantially perturbed by the scattering process .",
    "we now analyse the onset of oscillations in time .",

    "this overlap vanishes at time @xmath153 , i.e. , when the outcoupling lasers are switched on ( recall that the two clouds initially do not overlap ) .",

    "the amount of visibility and which - way information are related by an inequality @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to determine a visibility of the oscillating signal , as it contains information on the properties of the scattering systems .",
    "a visibility can be defined for sufficiently long times , averaging over several oscillating periods after the instant @xmath164 , and will be proportional to the amplitude of the oscillations of the photon flux , hence to the product of the condensate fractions of both systems .",
    "we remark , once again , that oscillations can be observed only in a single experimental run , while they will disappear after performing an ensemble average .",
    "therefore , this behaviour can only be measured in systems , whose properties are not deeply modified by the outcoupling of atoms .",
    "when this is not verified , the presence of a condensed fraction in the right system can be revealed by performing an ensemble average over a sufficient large number of experiments , in which the signal is monitored for sufficiently short times , warranting that the properties of the quantum gas have not been significantly modified , and taking the statistical distribution of the intensity of the photon flux at a given instant of time .",
