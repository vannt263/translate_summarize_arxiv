    "the connection between core collapse supernovae and neutron stars @xcite has had a solid observational footing for almost forty years , due largely to the discovery of young radio pulsars in supernova remnants ( snrs ) like vela @xcite and in the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "energetic young pulsars like these are strong radio and x - ray sources , and often power synchrotron nebulae called pulsar wind nebulae or pwne @xcite that are indirect markers of pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the idea that young neutron stars resemble the crab pulsar came to dominate the search for the products of supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , though , young neutron stars have been revealed in a wide variety of manifestations , from anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft @xmath2-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , to nearby thermal and radio quiet neutron stars , to long period radio pulsars with high inferred magnetic fields . as exemplified by the identification of the central compact object ( cco ) in the snr @xcite ,",
    "much of this diversity has come from x - ray observations .",
    "while this diversity is clearly demonstrated observationally , theory and simulation can not yet constrain the fundamental birth properties of neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models still have difficulties achieving explosions , much less following the activity in the post - collapse object in any detail .",
    "* hereafter ) have attempted to address our lack of understanding of stellar death and neutron star cooling by defining a volume - limited ( @xmath3  kpc ) sample of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , examining the neutron stars that they contain , and outlining a survey designed to detect or significantly constrain neutron stars in the remaining remnants .",
    "the primary subsample discussed in is one where the snr diameter is @xmath4 , so that the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ can observe a significant fraction of the snr interior with its acis - i detector and hence cover the area where neutron stars would be with a reasonable range of velocities ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the velocity perpendicular to the line of sight ) . also discuss two other subsamples of snrs : one with diameters @xmath7 for which _ xmm - newton _  is suitable ( and which we will present in a forthcoming paper ) , and one with @xmath8 .",
    "it is this subsample of the six largest snrs from that we consider here .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in   [",
    "sec : snrs ] we give brief summaries of the six snrs discussed here . in ",
    "[ sec : bsc ] we describe our identification of candidate x - ray sources in and around the snrs . in ",

    "however , with no estimate of the spin - down rate ( and hence no spin - down age ) , the period seems rather large to be associated with an snr ( it would require an unusual but not unheard of magnetic field of @xmath27  g ) , and no definite claim of an association can be made @xcite .",

    "@xcite searched snr  g74.0@xmath288.5  for promising x - ray point sources that might be compact objects , and identified two , one of which they later concluded was an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) on the basis of its long - term variability , x - ray spectrum , and radio counterpart @xcite , and the other of which they conclude may be a neutron star .",
    "the inner @xmath32 were searched for radio pulsars by @xcite down to a 430  mhz flux limit of 0.3  mjy , but given the size of snr  g74.0@xmath288.5  the lack of detection was not very constraining ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "snr  g205.5 + 0.5 , also known as the monoceros nebula , is a @xmath46 radio shell .",
    "the systemic velocity of optical line emission puts the snr at a distance of 0.8  kpc @xcite , although distances up to 1.6  kpc are preferred by low - frequency radio data that show the snr within the mon  ob2 association @xcite .",
    "the age is likely @xmath47  kyr , as inferred from fits to x - ray data @xcite .",
    "snr  g330.0 + 15.0 , the lupus loop , is a low surface brightness radio shell approximately @xmath48 in diameter .",
    "non - equilibrium fits to the x - ray data and comparison with the column density of the nearby remnant of sn  1006 suggest a distance of 1.01.2  kpc and an age of 50  kyr @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _  imaging of the entire fields of the large - diameter snrs listed in table  [ tab : snrs ] is impractical because of their sizes . their proximities ( @xmath49  kpc ) ,",
    "though , means that we do not need the high sensitivities of _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _  to achieve the same luminosity limit as in .",
    "we therefore used the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey bright source catalog ( hereafter bsc ; @xcite ) for our source selection .",
    "this was a survey of the entire sky with the position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) aboard _",
    "rosat_.    the positional accuracy of the pspc does not approach that of _ chandra _  or even _ xmm - newton _  ( typical uncertainties are @xmath50 ) , and the observations are not as deep as the pointed _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_observations used for the other snrs . nonetheless , the bsc is useful .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : snrs ] , its limit of @xmath51 in the pspc is actually of roughly comparable depth to our _ chandra _  observations in  @xmath52  when the smaller distances and column densities of the snrs in this paper are taken into account . while the x - ray positions do not in all cases allow unambiguous optical identifications , the relative brightness and softness of the x - ray sources compared to those in means that very often stars from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) or 2mass @xcite can be identified as counterparts .",
    "we selected the bsc sources within twice the nominal radii ( for elliptical sources , we took the semi - major axes ) of the snrs in table  [ tab : snrs ] ( as defined by their positions and sizes given by @xcite ) that had @xmath53 and were listed as unextended ( a value of 0 in the ` ext ` column of the bsc catalog ) . searching outside the remnants",
    "allowed us to find neutron stars that have overtaken the snr shocks  not an uncommon occurrence @xcite in snrs of the ages considered here ( 1030  kyr ) .",
    "this gave us all of the x - ray sources listed in table  [ tab : srcs ] .",
    "for the sake of comparison between sources , we plot the distribution of hardness ratios in figure  [ fig : hard ] .      in our analysis",
    ", we rejected those bsc sources that were identified as extended .",
    "this was for several reasons : we eliminated peaks in diffuse background emission that may have been identified as discrete sources , and we eliminated large extended objects such as galaxy clusters .",
    "practically , point sources offer much better astrometry and are better suited to counterpart identification .",
    "however , in some sense our selection was less than ideal .",
    "we would have eliminated any bright pwne , although these might have been identified by previous searches .",
    "also , source confusion makes our resulting luminosity limits less constraining than they might otherwise be , as two nearby point - sources could have been identified as a single extended source and hence been rejected .",
    "given the relatively low space density of bsc sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] ) this should not be a major effect , but it should still be noted .",
    "in contrast , our _ chandra _  observations do not suffer from any confusion limitations .",
    "one might ask if the diffuse emission from the snrs themselves will limit the depth of the bsc in the snr interiors . we have found in general that this is not the case .",
    "figure  [ fig : dens ] shows the density of bsc sources ( both point - like and of all sizes ) within different radii from the snr centers . while the inner reaches of the snrs have few sources and therefore poor statistics , in no case is there a statistically significant deficit of point sources inside the snr .",
    "there might be a slight deficit inside snr  g156.2 + 5.7  or snr  g160.9 + 2.6 , but these are also the smallest of the snrs and therefore have the fewest total sources .",
    "similarly , in figure  [ fig : bg ] we show the average background count - rates determined when extracting the sources plotted in figure  [ fig : dens ] , with the same binning .",
    "two of the snrs ( g65.3 + 5.7  and g74.0@xmath288.5 ) do show background increases in the interiors , two do not ( g205.5 + 0.5  and g330.0 + 15.0 ) , and two are uncertain due to few counts ( g156.2 + 5.7  and g160.9 + 2.6 ) , but even an increase of a factor of three above the mean background rate ( @xmath54 ) would give only @xmath55 within the 90% confidence radius of a pspc source ( for 0.3  kev ) which is a factor of 10 less than the minimum source count - rate for the bsc . therefore the diffuse snr emission should not have significantly affected the bsc source detection , and it is unlikely that there were any point sources that were missed .      besides the bsc , we took advantage of x - ray observations in the literature to identify additional sources for _ chandra _  followup .",
    "these were : for snr  g74.0@xmath288.5 , ax  j2049.6 + 2939 ( from _ asca _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and for snr  g205.5 + 0.5 : _ einstein _",
    "sources 1 , 3 , and 6 from @xcite , known as 1e  0627.4 + 0537 , 1e  0630.9 + 0611 , and 1e  0636.8 + 0517 , respectively .",
    "once we had assembled the list of x - ray sources , we then examined the publicly available surveys ( dss , 2mass , and nrao vla sky survey limit of the nvss . ]",
    "[ nvss ; @xcite ] ) , as well as examination of simbad and the relevant literature . with these sources of information",
    ", we were able to identify likely counterparts to 41 of the 50 sources in table  [ tab : srcs ] .",
    "we list the relevant data ( x - ray and optical ) of the identifications in table  [ tab : srcs ] , with a summary of all identifications and additional notes in table  [ tab : id ] .",
    "the separations between the nominal x - ray and optical positions were consistent with the predicted x - ray position uncertainties ( fig .",
    "[ fig : offset ] ) .",
    "there are a number of cases where there were multiple stars within the x - ray error circles , some of which were known to be physically associated with each other ( as noted in simbad ) . in these cases",
    "we list multiple possible counterparts in table  [ tab : srcs ] .",
    "the true source of the x - ray emission may be any one of the stars , or may in fact come from the interactions between them .",
    "while the identifications were made only on the basis of positional coincidence with bright stars , in many cases we can be additionally confident .",
    "this is because the stars are so bright ( @xmath56  mag ) that the chances of a false association are negligible or the stars are of types known to have x - ray emission ( e.g. , t tauri stars ) . to aid in the evaluation of our identifications ,",
    "we plot the cumulative number density of 2mass sources for each snr in figure  [ fig : stars ] . for a typical position uncertainty of @xmath50",
    ", we expect that all identifications with 2mass sources brighter than @xmath57  mag will be real ( chance probability @xmath0% ) , and even for sources brighter than @xmath58  mag the identifications will be probable ( chance rates @xmath59% ) .",
    "we note , though , that while 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037  is consistent with having an association with one of the identified 2mass sources , the association is not secure .",
    "chandra _  followup observation likely would have been definitive as it was for the majority of the ambiguous sources discussed in section  [ sec : cxo ] , but due to an oversight on our part this source was not selected for followup _ chandra _  observations .",
    "we therefore discuss 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037  in extra detail in section  [ sec : rxsd ] .    given the uncertainties in spectrum and foreground column density , virtually all of the x - ray sources are consistent with being stars ( as opposed to active galaxies ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fxk ] ) .",
    "we show 2mass images of the x - ray sources with optical counterparts indicated in figures  [ fig : opt1][fig : opt12 ] .",
    "the nine bsc sources that had no obvious optical counterparts ( excluding 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037 , as mentioned above ) , plus the four sources from   [ sec : addl ] , were selected for _ chandra _  followup observations . here , as in , we selected the exposure times ( 36  ksec ) based on the known column densities to the snrs ( tab .",
    "[ tab : snrs ] ) and a blackbody spectrum with @xmath60  kev .",
    "the positions are known to sufficient accuracy to allow use of the acis - s3 ccd @xcite .",
    "depending on the source brightnesses , however , we were concerned about photon pileup for some of the sources , so we used the @xmath61- or @xmath62-subarray modes ( which also provides improved timing information ) , depending on the positional uncertainties .",
    "a log of the observations is in table  [ tab : cxo ] .    in most of the cases ,",
    "the _ chandra _  observations revealed nothing extraordinary . in the case of the bsc sources",
    ", the _ chandra _  data typically showed that the bsc position was significantly off and/or the counterpart was faint ( figs .",

    "extragalactic nebula : :    the x - ray emission is much more compact than is typical for galaxy    groups or clusters ( even clusters at @xmath1451 have    @xmath146 ; @xcite ) , and the spectrum    is wrong ( thermal plasma models do not fit ) . early - type galaxy : :    the size is similar to what is often seen for early - type ( e and s0 )    galaxies . in those galaxies the x - ray emission comes from a    combination of hot gas ( plasma with @xmath1471.0  kev ; @xcite ) and the superposition of many hard    x - ray point sources ( whose spectra are power - laws with    @xmath148 )  reasonably compatible with the    observed spectrum of 1rxs  j193458.1 + 335301 .    +    for these galaxies , the hard x - ray luminosity scales reasonably well    with the integrated @xmath111 or @xmath149 band    luminosities as @xmath150    or @xmath151 , where the x - ray luminosity is in the    0.38.0  kev band and all luminosities are corrected for extinction    @xcite ; the scatter in this ( from a sample of 14 galaxies ) is a    factor of 23 ( there is more scatter in @xcite , but their work    concerns the soft emission more than the hard emission , and the    scatter is still only a factor of @xmath152 ) .",

    "we believe that the 2mass source is primarily due to source a , given the position coincidence and the extreme redness of a compared to b or c. if this is the case , though , then a has the relatively blue color of @xmath227  mag , but this could be partly due to the difficulties of measuring an extended source from images with drastically different seeing ( 2mass versus magic @xmath109-band ) .",
    "the ir colors of 2masx  j15014110@xmath284038093 are similar to the brighter galaxies in known clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , 2masx  j15014110@xmath284038093 could be the central galaxy of an unknown cluster .",
    "the x - ray temperature is reasonably high , implying a high luminosity ( @xmath228 ; @xcite ) , so this source can not be part of a nearby , low-@xmath229 group",
    ". however , the value of @xmath125 is lower than those of most known clusters @xcite , and is more similar to those of low-@xmath229 systems @xcite .    while 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  is compatible with the sizes and spectra of early - type galaxies , and there is an extended optical / ir source near the peak of the x - ray emission , the scenario is not entirely consistent .",

    "[ eqn : flux ] is @xmath230  mag ) .",
    "this is far greater than the variation seen among galaxies .",
    "we do not believe that the difference can be due to an excess of soft emission in 1rxs  j193458.1 + 335301  or 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : flux ] refers only to the contribution of hard point sources ) , as the spectra of 1rxs  j193458.1 + 335301  and 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  are hard and similar to the prototypical sources assumed in @xcite and when one fits primarily for the soft emission ( as in @xcite ) one finds a similar relation to that of @xcite .",
    "it is possible that 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  is an over - luminous elliptical galaxy , such as those discussed in @xcite , as the size , optical / x - ray flux ratio , and luminosity are similar to these sources ( @xmath231 ; @xmath232 assuming @xmath233 ) , but again there are difficulties : the temperature of 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  is considerably higher than those of @xcite , and the value of @xmath125 is too low .",
    "we see that no scenario is entirely consistent for 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815 .",
    "pwne , isolated elliptical galaxies , and galaxy clusters all have problems .",
    "we believe it likely that 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  does have an extragalactic origin , as 2masx  j15014110@xmath284038093 looks like an elliptical galaxy and it is probably associated with the x - ray emission : there are 39 extended 2mass sources within @xmath234 of 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815 , giving a false - association rate of 0.005% for a source within @xmath235 . however , it is not clear exactly what 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  is . as with 1rxs",
    "j193458.1 + 335301 , deeper x - ray observations and optical spectroscopy should be conclusive for 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815 .",
    "we have fully investigated the population of _ rosat _  bsc point sources in six large - diameter snrs .",
    "our identifications of counterparts to 50 of the 54 sources are quite secure : in most cases the positional coincidence between the x - ray and optical / ir sources has been augmented by identification of an abnormal stellar type ( variable , t tau , binary , etc . ) , by the extreme brightness ( and hence rarity ) of the optical source , or by a previous classification in the literature .",
    "this conclusion echoes that of @xcite , who searched for older neutron stars using _ rosat _  and found only previously identified neutron stars , along with 17 sources that are definitely not neutron stars and 13 that are probably not .",
    "the remaining sources , as discussed in section  [ sec : remain ] , are more intriguing .",
    "however , none of them is likely to be a neutron star associated with one of the snrs in table  [ tab : snrs ] . to begin with , all are outside their snrs . while this is not impossible for older sources and high velocity neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it lessens the chance of association .    for 1rxs  j193458.1 + 335301  and 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  the x - ray morphologies rule out associations , since any pwne outside the snrs would likely have elongated bow - shock appearances , in contrast to what we see ( of course , 1rxs  j193458.1 + 335301  and/or 1rxs  j150139.6@xmath28403815  could be extragalactic ) .",
    "1rxs  j205042.9 + 284643  and 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037 , neither of which has a _",
    "chandra _",
    "detection , are more uncertain .",
    "1rxs  j205042.9 + 284643  is likely a flare star .",
    "1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037  does not have a provisional classification but is probably extragalactic in origin .",
    "since we have ruled out ( to some degree of certainty ) neutron stars in all six snrs considered here , we can then follow and draw the x - ray luminosity limits on a cooling diagram .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : cool ] . to account for the uncertainties of 1rxs  j205042.9 + 284643and 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037 , both in snr  g74.0@xmath288.5",
    ", we have adjusted the luminosity of that snr from table  [ tab : snrs ] to correspond to @xmath236  above the count - rates of both of the uncertain sources and therefore a more secure limit .",
    "further x - ray observations of 1rxs  j205812.8 + 292037  would very likely detect counterparts ( for 1rxs  j205042.9 + 284643 , it might have only been included in the bsc due to a flare , and therefore significantly deeper x - ray observations may be necessary ) . with secure counterparts ,",
    "the limit for snr  g74.0@xmath288.5  would decrease by a factor of 3 .",
    "the limits in figure  [ fig : cool ] are not as uniform or as constraining as those from .",
    "the lack of uniformity is due to the sample construction : the different distances and column densities of the snrs make the bsc limit of @xmath237 translate into different luminosities .",
    "so , snrs g74.0@xmath288.5 , g330.0 + 15.0 , and g65.3 + 5.7  all have reasonably tight limits ( and those of snr  g74.0@xmath288.5could get better ) .",
    "snrs g160.9 + 2.6  and g205.5 + 0.5  have loose limits primarily due to uncertain distances : we have used the upper limit of 4  kpc for snr  g160.9 + 2.6  and the full range of 0.81.6  kpc for snr  g205.5 + 0.5  in figure  [ fig : cool ] .",
    "finally , snr  g156.2 + 5.7  is more highly absorbed than the other snrs .    while all of the limits are below the luminosities of central sources in cas  a , , and ( and are therefore in concordance with our original survey design from ) , some are further below than others .",
    "the utility of these limits is somewhat lessened , though , as the snrs are all reasonably large and are older ( 1030  kyr ) than the sources in ( 310  kyr ) . therefore the cooling curves have descended , and there are other snrs that have similar or even lower neutron star luminosities ( , , for the snrs with tighter limits , and , snrs  , , and for the remaining snrs ) , although 5/7 of these sources have x - ray pwne that increase their luminosities by a factor of @xmath152 .    in one sense ,",
    "though , the limits here are tighter than those of . by using the bsc to go to twice the snr radii , we have virtually eliminated the possibility that there are high - velocity neutron stars in these snrs ( as discussed in   [ sec : ext ] confusion is most likely not a limiting factor in detecting x - ray sources ) , while in we only searched a portion of the snr interiors .",
    "it is of course possible that the sn explosions were type  ia or produced black holes , but as discussed in these alternate scenarios are not very likely for an ensemble .",
    "therefore , while not as tight as those of ( or e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , our limits are still useful .",
    "they are not below all detected neutron stars , so do not require appeals to exotic physics or cooling processes , but they conclusively demonstrate that there is a significant range in the observed luminosities of neutron stars , even including experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is clear that the neutron stars of a single age must be able to produce a luminosities differing by a factor of @xmath238 .",
    "whether the unknown parameter that controls the luminosity is one of the usual culprits ( mass , rotation , composition , magnetic field ) or something entirely different is not known .",
    "it is also clear that there is a significant number of objects that do not show non - thermal emission and would therefore not go on to evolve as traditional radio pulsars .",

    "<S> these snrs are nearby , with typical distances of @xmath0  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore used the _ rosat _  bright source catalog and past observations in the literature to identify x - ray point sources in and near the snrs . </S>",
    "<S> out of 54 sources , we were immediately able to identify optical / ir counterparts to 41 from existing data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained _ chandra _  snap - shot images of the remaining 13 sources . </S>",
    "<S> of these , 10 were point sources with readily identified counterparts , two were extended , and one was not detected in the _ chandra _  observation but is likely a flare star . </S>",
    "<S> one of the extended sources may be a pulsar wind nebula , but if so it is probably not associated with the nearby snr . </S>",
    "<S> we are then left with no identified neutron stars in these six snrs down to luminosity limits of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these limits are generally less than the luminosities of typical neutron stars of the same ages , but are compatible with some lower - luminosity sources such as the neutron stars in the snrs cta  1 and ic  443 . </S>"
