    "similar to the black holes , wormholes in @xmath1dimensions also constitute informative objects to help us learn more about their higher dimensional counterparts .",
    "same is also true for the thin - shell wormholes ( tsws ) mv1 which are constructed from an energy - momentum at the throat through cut - and - paste technique satisfying the proper junction conditions .",
    "we recall that the history of tsws started with the visser s construction in a @xmath2dimensional flat minkowski spacetime @xcite . at the same time he extended the idea to the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite . in his book @xcite and work with poisson @xcite they introduced into physics the terminology of tsws first . in the latter work they considered also the stability of a tsw .",
    "ever since , there have been extensive attempts to understand different features of the new kind of wormholes . for a short list of such attempts",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite and references cited therein . among the works on tsw we see generalizations to higher @xcite , lower @xcite dimensions and to the extend of lovelock gravity lovelock .",
    "the theory has also been considered in cylindrical symmetry cylin , dilaton theory @xcite and so on .",
    "the common feature of all these extensions is that the bulk spacetimes are all static .",
    "we are well - aware about the difficulties in rotating thin - shell wormholes ( rtsw ) .",
    "for this reason we restrict ourselves in this study to the relatively simpler case of @xmath1dimensions .",
    "the absence of gravitational degrees of freedom , namely , weyl curvature in the lower dimension enforces us to add new physical parameters such as cosmological constant , electric / magnetic charge , scalar charge and rotation .",
    "our aim in this study is to consider rtsws in @xmath1dimensions .",
    "the metric function contains the square of angular momentum @xmath3 which does nt distinguish the cases of @xmath4 for angular momentum .",
    "we recall that rotating tsws constructed from kerr black hole in @xmath2dimensions have been considered in @xcite and their geodesics have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "also rotational effects for collapsing thin - shells in @xmath1 and @xmath5dimensions have been considered in detail in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    in our analysis of tsws",
    "we observe that the off - diagonal components of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath6 and related components of the surface energy - momentum at the throat @xmath7 vanish in case we assume counterrotating components of shells at the throat .",
    "the gas pressures from the upper and lower shells cancel each other to modify the equation of state to the extend that it becomes equivalent to a static case .",
    "we may draw a rough analogy from the rotating earth .",
    "due to the non - inertial effects curly geodesics of winds i.e. the coriolis effect matching at the equator are counter - circular in different hemispheres .",
    "if the two hemispheres of our earth were counterrotating instead of corotating the curly motions should be identical .",
    "counterrotation at the throat in the case of tsws allows us to choose a simpler surface energy - momentum tensor and study the stability condition .",
    "we can choose , for instance , a linear gas ( lg ) equation of state ( eos ) at the junction in which the pressure is linearly related to the mass density .",
    "for such a lg the counterrotating components make the tsw more stable .",
    "increasing angular momentum magnitude i.e. the relative rotation stabilizes the tsw further .",
    "our next attempt toward a stable tsw is to assume a velocity dependent perturbation of the lg .",
    "it is observed that our stability argument is restricted by the linear perturbation alone in which at the equilibrium radius ( @xmath8 ) we have the initial conditions @xmath9 once we assume that @xmath10 the perturbed throat grows exponentially to make the tsw unstable .",
    "this behavior is proved explicitly .",
    "the @xmath1dimensional rotating baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( rbtz ) black hole solution is @xcite@xmath11 in which@xmath12and@xmath13herein @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mass and angular momentum of the rbtz black hole .",
    "we note that in order to have two horizons @xmath17 . to construct the thin shell wormhole we use the method of cut - and - paste introduced in @xcite .",
    "according to this method we take two copies of the bulk @xmath18 with the line elements@xmath19and we paste them at an identical hypersurface @xmath20 for convenience we move to a corotating frame by introducing @xmath21 on each side separately . the line elements in both sides",
    "become@xmath22 ^{2}.\\end{gathered}\\]]the product manifold is complete with one boundary at the hypersurface @xmath23 which we shall call the throat . on the throat",
    "the line element is given by@xmath24to make the israel junction conditions @xcite satisfied , first of all we have @xmath25 followed by@xmath26 in which a @xmath27 stands for the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath28 next , the einstein s equations ( israel junction conditions ) on the hypersurface become@xmath29 in which @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32is the extrinsic curvature with embedding coordinate @xmath33 . also the normal unit vector is defined as @xmath34the surface energy - momentum tensor of the throat is chosen to be a perfect fluid type gas with@xmath35here @xmath36 is the energy density of the shell , @xmath37 is the tangential pressure at the throat and @xmath38 is the shell s velocity .",
    "we note that in rotating system in both sides of the throat @xmath39 and therefore @xmath40 which means that @xmath41diag@xmath42 .",

    "[ n_{+}^{\\varphi } \\left ( r\\right ) + n_{-}^{\\varphi } \\left ( r\\right ) \\right ] } { r } & \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\dot{r}^{2}+f}}{r}% \\end{array}% \\right ) .\\]]having @xmath47 diagonal implies that @xmath48 which consequently admits @xmath49 this in turn implies that the upper - shell and the lower - shell are counterrotating , i. e. they spin in opposite directions .",
    "this configuration is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "( we should add that thin - shells in @xmath2dimensions with counterrotating kerr black holes have been constructed before in @xcite . ) on the other hand , since @xmath50 appears in @xmath51 , it does not create any problem in having the other conditions satisfied .",
    "therefore @xmath52@xmath53are the only left israel equations to be satisfied . with the assumption @xmath54",
    "therefore the problem becomes equivalent to the static ( i.e. non - rotating ) case . at the equilibrium state",
    "where @xmath55 with @xmath56 one gets@xmath57and@xmath58one observes easily that the energy conditions are not satisfied since @xmath59 the rest of the paper investigates the role of the angular momentum on the stability of the tsw .",
    "from eq . ( 15 ) one finds@xmath60which can be written as @xmath61with @xmath62 also , from ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , it is a simple task to show that@xmath63if we try to perturb the tsw from its equilibrium point , this relation must be satisfied . to keep our analysis as general as possible , we consider @xmath64 in which @xmath65 is a well defined function of @xmath66 .",
    "one can show that @xmath67 and therefore the first nonzero term of expansion of @xmath68 about @xmath8 is @xmath69 given by@xmath70 in which @xmath71 and where quantities with a subindex @xmath72 implies they are calculated at the throat @xmath73 the equation of motion of the throat , for small perturbation , becomes@xmath74or equivalently@xmath75 in which @xmath76 therefore for @xmath77 the motion of the throat is oscillatory with angular frequency @xmath78 which implies that tsw is stable . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath79 motion is exponential type and hence the throat upon the perturbation is unstable . in the following sections we shall consider a specific eos i.e. @xmath80 and for fixed values of mass and @xmath81 we study the effect of the angular momentum @xmath82 on stability of the wormhole .",
    "the eos of a lg is given by @xmath83 in which @xmath84 is a constant parameter .",
    "one observes that for the cases @xmath85and@xmath86@xmath87 and the equilibrium is stable . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the stability region with respect to @xmath84 and @xmath88 in the same figure the result for different @xmath16 are compared .",
    "as one can see , increasing the value of @xmath16 increases the region of stability .",
    "therefore the rtsw supported by a perfect fluid with an eos of the form of lg , becomes more stable .",
    "let s comment that , different eos may also be investigated but in this work lg is enough to show the contribution of the angular momentum .     and",
    "@xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and various values for the angular momentum @xmath92 the value of @xmath16 is given from the top to the bottom as : @xmath93 and @xmath94 we note that for @xmath95 the bulk possesses a degenerate horizon ( extremal black hole ) and for @xmath96 the bulk solution is not a black hole .",
    "the stability region for each case is shown with an arrow . according to this figure ,",
    "one concludes that the bigger angular momentum , the more stable rtsw .",
    ", width=264 ]      in this section we apply the small velocity perturbation method which is based on the assumption that the eos of the fluid supporting the wormhole after the perturbation is same as when the wormhole is at its equilibrium . from this assumption one finds from eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16)@xmath97which yields the equation of motion for the throat after the small speed perturbation as@xmath98equivalently this amounts to @xmath99which admits @xmath100using the explicit form of @xmath51 and upon integration yields @xmath101perhaps it would be much easier to comment on @xmath102 if we could find a closed form for it but even in this form one can see that the motion is not oscillatory .",
    "this means that although the speed of the throat does not increase dramatically with respect to @xmath102 the equilibrium is not stable .",
    "for a tsw in 2 + 1-dimensions it is observed that by pasting two counterrotating shells at the throat the off - diagonal elements of the surface energy tensor @xmath47 ( and related @xmath103 ) vanish .",
    "that is , although @xmath104 and @xmath105 are not affected the gluing procedure sets @xmath106 this amounts to the mutual cancellation of the upper and lower pressure components of the fluid , leaving only the pressure component @xmath107    the effect of the rotation on the geometry , however , remains intact as it depends on the square of the angular momentum ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "stability of a counterrotating tsw for a gas of linear equation of state turns out to make the tsw more stable . for very fast rotation",
    "the stability region grows much larger in the parameter space . for a velocity dependent perturbation ,",
    "however , it is shown that tsw is no more stable .",
    "that is , perturbation of the throat radius ( @xmath8 ) that depends on initial speed ( @xmath108 ) , no matter how small , does nt return to the equilibrium radius @xmath8 again .",
    "although our work is confined to the simple @xmath1dimensional spacetime it is our belief that similar behaviors are exhibited also by the higher dimensional tsws ."
