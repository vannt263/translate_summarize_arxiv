    "the possibility of deviating from such a simple yet effective model has been widely considered throughout the literature , _",
    "e.g. _ by taking into account less symmetric backgrounds or by introducing less ideal matter sources .",
    "for instance , in the context of generalizing the type of fluid that sources the cosmological evolution , one could think of introducing dissipative terms in the energy - momentum tensor , in order to take into account nonequilibrium effects in the fluid(s ) .",
    "a first approach for describing nonequilibrium thermodynamic effects in a relativistic context was given by eckart @xcite .",
    "unfortunately such a theory presents noncausal features , admitting superluminal propagation of the dissipative signals : this pathology lead other authors to seek for a second - order , causal extension , which could be identified in the so - called israel ",

    "@xcite , and have been shown to agree with is not far from equilibrium ) . in the present paper we work along these lines , by including in the dynamics of an expanding metric a nonequilibrium contribution to the equilibrium pressure @xmath3 of the fluid , in the form of a bulk viscous pressure @xmath4 ( some previous studies on the topic can be found _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that , in considering a homogeneous and isotropic background , other dissipative processes with directional character ",
    "heat transfer and shear viscosity  do not contribute to the dynamics .",
    "the model governing the evolution of bulk viscous pressure that we choose to consider is a nonlinear extension of israel - stewart s model ( nis from now on ) , presented for the first time in @xcite and further analysed in @xcite .",
    "apart from the relaxational time @xmath5 typical of is causal theory , the nis introduces a characteristic time @xmath6 for nonlinear effects such that , when @xmath7 , one recovers is .",
    "the phenomenological nature of such a model has been made clear in the original work and the general conditions underlying the hydrodynamic description ( at the foundation of all the previously mentioned models ) are also understood : for instance , one has to be aware that the requirement that the mean interaction time @xmath8 between fluid particles be less than the time scale @xmath9 set by cosmological expansion ( where @xmath10 is the expansion scalar ) could cease to hold in the case of accelerated expansion . +",
    "the main task of the present work , carried out by means of a dynamical system approach , is to describe the space of solutions of an expanding frw spacetime in presence of a double - fluid source : a pressureless dust component and a viscous radiation component whose bulk pressure is governed by the nis model .",
    "we do not necessarily focus on the viability of the results in terms of observational consistency ; rather we choose to explore in a more general way the impact of the specific nonlinear model on the past and future dynamics .",
    "+ we first present the background setting and the model in sec.[one ] ; we then analyse the corresponding dynamical system in sec.[two ] , where critical points of the system are identified and their stability assessed ; in sec.[gen ] we give interpretation of the results in terms of cosmological models and finally we give some concluding comment in sec.[conc ] .",
    "our analysis takes place in standard general relativity , hence einstein s field equations ( efe ) @xmath11 are considered a valid starting point . from now on we will adopt the convention @xmath12 .",

    "has an effective pressure @xmath20 , where the first term is the equilibrium part whereas @xmath4 is the nonequilibrium contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ the bulk viscous pressure . by specifying the metric and the matter content of the model we are then able to write down the relevant equations for the system .",
    "first of all , the friedmann constraint equation coming from efe , @xmath21 allows us to disregard the evolution of the dust component and hence to focus only on the evolution for the energy density of the viscous fluid : by imposing energy - momentum conservation and making use of the constraint we have that @xmath22 moreover , from efe we obtain the raychaudhuri equation @xmath23 where we made use again of eq ..    the introduction of a viscous pressure begs for a specification of its nature and behaviour through some evolution equation .",

    "the nonlinear character of the nis model is expressed by the term in round brackets and it is governed by a relaxational time @xmath6 : if such characteristic time @xmath7 , we recover is theory .",
    "the nonlinear term itself is inversely proportional to the entropy production rate in the fluid and hence , for thermodynamic consistency , has to be positive .",

    "in order to write the evolution equations in the form of an autonomous system , we define the following dimensionless variables : @xmath37 we define also a new time variable @xmath5 through @xmath38 , whose action on the variables will be denoted by a prime .",

    "it is immediately clear from eq .",
    "that the system is ill - defined in the subspaces z@xmath42 and @xmath43 so , apart from locating the critical points , we will need to study the behaviour of the system in a neighborhood of such planes in the phase space : this will be done through a numerical analysis .",
    "note also that the singular behaviour in z @xmath44 will prevent this variable to change sign during the evolution : in the following we will focus on the part where z @xmath45 .    in the case",
    "when @xmath46 , eq .",
    "gives z @xmath47 , as can be seen also from the definition in eq .",
    ": the dimensionality of the system is thus reduced from 3 to 2 and the analysis is formally equivalent to the one carried out in @xcite . with regard to this case",
    "we will just report some general considerations in sec .",

    "we start by locating and analyzing the critical points with finite values of the coordinates in the phase space .",

    "the scale factor of the model in that point will be @xmath52 .",
    "the energy density and viscous pressure in such a model would attain , respectively , the constant values @xmath53 + in the invariant set @xmath54 ( _ i.e. _ where @xmath55 ) we find a finite critical point of this kind : @xmath56 requiring positivity of z imposes either @xmath57 or @xmath58 , but only in the former case @xmath59 lies in the physical region of the phase space given by the constraints on the variables .",
    "thus , considering the bound on @xmath32 found previously , the existence of this critical point is subject to the condition @xmath60 also in @xcite possibility of exponential inflation was found in this range of velocities .",
    "the location of @xmath59 does not depend on @xmath1 , but the stability properties depend crucially on the exponent . by studying the linearized system around the point",
    "we conclude that @xmath59 is a stable attractor for @xmath61 and an unstable saddle for @xmath62 . in the following",
    "we will assume validity of the bound eq.([vbound ] ) , because the dynamics results to be richer .",

    "the dynamics now takes place in 2-dimensional invariant subsets ( @xmath74 ) of the original 3-dimensional problem , one subset for each value of z.    defining the constant @xmath75 , we have the following system of equations : @xmath39\\label{red1}\\\\   \\tilde{\\pi } ' & = - 4\\ , c_b^2\\ , \\omega \\left [ 1+\\frac{\\tilde{\\pi}\\ , \\omega^{1/2}}{3\\ \\text{z}_0 } \\left ( \\omega+\\frac{3\\ , k^2}{4\\ , c_b^2}\\ \\tilde{\\pi } \\right)^{-1 } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\    & \\ \\ \\ + 3 \\frac{\\tilde{\\pi}^2}{\\omega}\\left(\\omega - \\frac{5}{8}\\right ) - ( 1-\\omega)\\tilde{\\pi}\\label{red2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "a future de sitter attractor is possible but a fine tuning of the parameters is needed .",

    "in translating the properties of the phase space elements in terms of cosmological models we choose to disregard the trajectories emerging from the boundary of the unphysical region ( shaded in gray in all the figs . ) .",
