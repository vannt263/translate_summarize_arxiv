    "synchronization of chaotic systems has been an active research area in recent years  @xcite . now the notion of synchronization of chaotic systems is extended far beyond complete synchronization between identical systems@xcite , and various kinds of nonlinear synchronization have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a significant extension is _ generalized synchronization _ ( gs )",

    "observed data is a challenging problem , especially in biology ; e.g. , for study on nonlinear interdependence observed in binding of different features in cognitive process  @xcite and epilepsies in the brain  @xcite . in",
    "unidirectionally coupled systems , a way to detect gs is to make an identical copy @xmath5 of the response system @xmath4 driven by the common signal from the driver system @xmath3 , then investigate whether orbits of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 coincide after transient  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very difficult to prepare an identical copy of the response system , and this approach does not give any information on the structure of the synchronization manifold @xmath6 in the state space . on the other hand , several indices have been proposed  @xcite , to quantify nonlinear dependence between @xmath3 and @xmath4 based on a local relation between them . while the usefulness of these indices were shown in some examples  @xcite , those approaches are still ad - hoc , lacking systematic methods for unifying the local relation of different regions in the state space .",
    "recently , _ kernel methods _ have been attracting much attention in the machine learning community as powerful tools for analyzing data with high nonlinearity  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel approach for analyzing gs based on _ kernel canonical correlation analysis _",
    "( kernel cca )  @xcite which is a version of the kernel methods  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that the kernel cca provides a suitable index for measuring the nonlinear interdependence , and gives global coordinates characterizing the synchronization manifold @xmath7 of gs .",
    "note that the latter has not been addressed in conventional studies on the analysis of gs .",
    "the proposed method does not require explicit knowledge on the underlying equations behind time series .",
    "although we restrict our attention to the analysis of numerical experiments here , it is also applicable to experimental data .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce a formulation of the kernel cca .",
    "sections  3 and 4 provide several successful applications of the kernel cca for treating gs . in section  5",
    ", it is demonstrated that the nonstationary change of the coupling strength between two chaotic systems can be captured by the proposed approach . in section  6",
    ", we discuss an issue on the choice of kernel parameters .",
    "our conclusion is given in section  7 .",
    "canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) is a multivariate analysis method to find a pair of vectors that maximize the correlation coefficient between projections of signals onto them  @xcite .",
    "cca is useful for detecting a linear relation between a pair of multidimensional data sets , but can not deal with the case like gs where there is a high nonlinear relation between two data sets . extending the ability of cca for analyzing",
    "data with nonlinearity , kernelization of cca has been proposed by several researchers  @xcite .",
    "an intuitive formulation of the kernel cca is as follows . for a pair of multivariate variables @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the kernel cca seeks a pair of nonlinear scalar functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that an estimator of the correlation coefficient @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is maximized .",
    "methods based on the expression  ( [ rho_f ] ) of the generalized correlation coefficient have a long history  @xcite .",
    "however the use of the kernel approach gives a notable progress in the subject , with a remarkably simple and flexible way of treating  ( [ rho_f ] ) .",
    "the essence of the kernel methods is an assumption that nonlinear functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are well approximated by linear combinations of _ kernels _ on data points @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a training data set of @xmath8 .",
    "examples of kernels are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23  @xcite .",

    ", the dependence of the expressions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the given data @xmath20 brings some ad - hoc nature to the method .",
    "the assumption is , however , equivalent to the assumption that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are minimum norm functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) .",
    "it is proved by invoking _",
    "representer theorem _ in the theory of rkhs  @xcite . substituting ( [ fg ] ) into ( [ rho_f ] ) , and replacing covariance @xmath26 and variances @xmath27 with empirical averages over the data set @xmath20 , the kernel cca reduces to the maximization of @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the _ gram matrices _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined with the given sample .",
    "the gram matrix contains relevant topological information of data points in the state space . for simplicity",
    ", we tentatively assume that the averages of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are zero . later we will show that subtraction of the averages from data can be done in an implicit way and does not cause any technical difficulty .",
    "a naive generalization of cca leads to the maximization of @xmath36 subject to @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "taking derivatives of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 from the constraint , the kernel cca is formulated as the following generalized eigenvalue problem : @xmath45 there is , however , a difficulty when the gram matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 are invertible . by multiplying both sides of ( [ kcca_1 ] ) by @xmath48 from the left hand side",
    ", we have @xmath49 substituting ( [ invert_case_beta ] ) into ( [ invert_case_alpha ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 which gives a trivial solution @xmath51 .",
    "such a situation is not uncommon , because the gram matrix is invertible when a gaussian kernel is used and data points are distinct each other .",
    "thus the naive kernelization ( [ kcca_1 ] ) of cca does not provide useful information on the nonlinear dependence .    to overcome this problem",
    "we introduce small regularization terms in the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ rho_2 ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are quadratic norms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the rkhs defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 is its parameter .",
