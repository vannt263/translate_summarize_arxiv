    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) are a nonperturbative means of studying qcd in the continuum .",
    "this is illustrated in the overview provided by ref.@xcite .",
    "a strength of the approach is that the chiral limit ; viz . , the domain of physical pion masses , is directly accessible .",
    "indeed , with the established existence of a systematic , nonperturbative and symmetry - preserving truncation scheme @xcite the dses were used to prove that the pion is simultaneously a goldstone mode and a bound - state of effectively massive constituents @xcite .",
    "moreover , the exact nature of those dressed - quark and dressed - antiquark constituents is explained by the dses @xcite .",
    "namely , the quark - parton of qcd acquires a momentum - dependent mass function that at infrared momenta is larger by two orders - of - magnitude than the current - quark mass , an effect which owes primarily to a heavy cloud of gluons that clothes a low - momentum quark .- point schwinger functions for ghosts and gluons experience analogous nonperturbative modification in the infrared @xcite .",
    "] this is illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] .",
    "since a weak coupling expansion of the dses generates every diagram in perturbation theory , it is straightforward to ensure that model - dependent assumptions are restricted to infrared momenta .",
    "one can therefore turn a comparison of dse predictions with data into a probe of the long - range interaction between light - quarks in qcd ; namely , a unique means of exploring light - quark confinement . in large part",
    "this study is the same as drawing a map of the infrared behaviour of the qcd @xmath2-function .",
    "it is a fact too often ignored that the potential between infinitely heavy quarks measured in numerical simulations of quenched - qcd  the static potential  is not related in any known way to the confinement of light - quarks .",
    "dressed - quark mass function , @xmath3 : solid curves  dse results , obtained as explained in refs.@xcite , `` data ''  numerical simulations of unquenched lattice - qcd @xcite . in this figure one observes the current - quark of perturbative qcd evolving into a constituent - quark as its momentum becomes smaller .",
    "the constituent - quark mass arises from a cloud of low - momentum gluons attaching themselves to the current - quark .",
    "this is dynamical chiral symmetry breaking : an essentially nonperturbative effect that generates a quark mass _ from nothing _ ; viz .",
    ", it occurs even in the chiral limit.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "since the gap equation is so fundamental to understanding hadron physics we reproduce it here : @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents a poincar invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath6 the regularisation mass - scale @xcite , @xmath7 is the dressed - gluon propagator , @xmath8 is the dressed - quark - gluon vertex , and @xmath9 is the quark s @xmath6-dependent bare current - mass .",
    "the vertex and quark wave - function renormalisation constants , @xmath10 , depend on the gauge parameter .",
    "the solution ; namely , the dressed - quark propagator , can be written @xmath11 wherein the mass function , @xmath12 , illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] , is independent of the renormalisation point , @xmath13 . the solution is obtained from eq.([gendse ] ) augmented by the renormalisation condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the running mass : @xmath16 with @xmath17 the lagrangian - mass renormalisation constant . in qcd the chiral limit",
    "is strictly defined by @xcite : @xmath18 which states that the renormalisation - point - invariant current - quark mass @xmath19 . in this limit",
    "it is possible to unambiguously define the gauge invariant vacuum quark condensate in terms of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this fact emphasises that gauge covariant quantities contain gauge invariant information .    the question of whether @xmath12 has an expansion in current - quark mass around its chiral - limit value bears upon the radius of convergence for chiral perturbation theory . with this question",
    "one is asking whether it is possible to write @xmath21 on a measurable domain of current - quark mass .",
    "it was found @xcite that such an expansion exists for @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 can be reported as follows : for a pseudoscalar meson constituted from a quark , @xmath24 , with mass @xmath23 and its antiparticle , @xmath25 , @xmath26gev . since physical observables , such as the leptonic decay constant of a pseudoscalar meson ,",
    "are expressed in terms of @xmath12 , it follows that a chiral expansion is meaningful only for @xmath27gev@xmath28 .",
    "is never within the domain of uniform convergence .",
    "] this entails , e.g. , that it is only valid to employ chiral perturbation theory to fit and extrapolate results from numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd when the simulation parameters provide for @xmath29gev@xmath28 .",
    "lattice results at larger pion masses are not within the domain of convergence of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is a fact in qcd and this amplifies the importance of the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the existence of a sensible truncation of the dses has enabled proof via that identity of a body of exact results for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "they relate even to radial excitations and/or hybrids @xcite , and heavy - light @xcite and heavy - heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "the results have been illustrated using a renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation @xcite , which also provided a prediction of the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite .",
    "implications for neutral pseudoscalar mesons have been elucidated @xcite . in the general case",
    "the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity is written @xmath30 wherein : @xmath31 are the generators of @xmath32 ; the dressed - quark propagator @xmath33diag@xmath34 $ ] is matrix - valued ; @xmath35 is the matrix of renormalised ( running ) current - quark masses and @xmath36,$ ] where the trace is over flavour indices .",
    "the inhomogeneous axial - vector vertex in eq.([avwti ] ) , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total momentum of the quark - antiquark pair and @xmath39 the relative momentum , satisfies a bethe - salpeter equation , and likewise the pseudoscalar vertex , @xmath40 .    the final term in eq.([avwti ] ) expresses the non - abelian axial anomaly .",
    "it involves @xmath41 wherein the matrix element represents an operator expectation value in full qcd and @xmath42 is the topological charge density operator , where @xmath43 is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "it is plain and important that only @xmath44 is nonzero .",
    "it is fundamentally important that while @xmath45 is gauge invariant , the associated chern - simons current , @xmath46 , is not .",
    "it follows that in qcd no physical state can couple to @xmath46 and hence that physical states can not provide a resolution of the so - called @xmath0-problem ; namely , they can not play any role in ensuring that the @xmath47 is not a goldstone mode .    in thinking about the @xmath0-problem",
    "it is only necessary to focus on the case @xmath48 because if that is not so , then following ref.@xcite it is clear that the @xmath47 is certainly a goldstone mode .",
    "@xmath49 is a pseudoscalar vertex and can therefore be expressed @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation([avwti ] ) can now be used to derive a collection of chiral - limit , pointwise goldberger - treiman relations , important amongst which is the identity @xmath51 where @xmath52 is obtained in solving the chiral - limit gap equation .",
    "it is now plain that if @xmath53 then @xmath54 .",
    "this being true , then the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation for the @xmath47 does not possess a massless solution in the chiral limit .",
    "the converse is also true ; namely , the absence of such a solution requires eq.([caleb ] ) .",
    "hence , eq.([caleb ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of a massless @xmath47 bound - state .",
    "it is the chiral limit that is being discussed , in which case @xmath55 if , and only if , chiral symmetry is dynamically broken .",
    "hence , the absence of a massless @xmath47 bound - state is only assured through the existence of an intimate connection between dcsb and an expectation value of the topological charge density .",
    "reference@xcite derives a range of corollaries , amongst which are mass formulae for neutral pseudoscalar mesons , and presents an _ ansatz _ for the bethe - salpeter kernel that enables their illustration . despite its simplicity ,",
    "the model is elucidative and phenomenologically efficacious ; e.g. , it predicts @xmath56@xmath47 mixing angles of @xmath57 , @xmath58@xmath56 angles of @xmath59 , and a strong neutron - proton mass difference of @xmath60 .",
    "partly because attention to this sector has only recently increased , the current level of expertise in studying baryons is roughly the same as it was with mesons more than ten years ago ; viz . , model building and phenomenology .",
    "we are a little ahead of that game , however , because much has been learnt in meson applications ; e.g. , as outlined above , a veracious understanding of the structure of dressed - quarks and -gluons has been acquired .    in quantum field theory",
    "a nucleon appears as a pole in a six - point quark green function .",
    "the pole s residue is proportional to the nucleon s faddeev amplitude , which is obtained from a poincar covariant faddeev equation that adds - up all possible quantum field theoretical exchanges and interactions that can take place between three dressed - quarks .",
    "this is important because modern , high - luminosity experimental facilities employ large momentum transfer reactions ; viz .",
    ", @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the nucleon s mass , and hence a veracious understanding of contemporary data requires a poincar covariant description of the nucleon .",
    "a tractable truncation of the faddeev equation is based @xcite on the observation that an interaction which describes mesons also generates diquark correlations in the colour-@xmath63 channel @xcite .",
    "the dominant correlations for ground state octet and decuplet baryons are @xmath64 and @xmath65 diquarks because , e.g. : the associated mass - scales are smaller than the baryons masses @xcite , namely ( in gev )  @xmath66_{0^+ } } = 0.74 - 0.82 $ ] , @xmath67 ; and the electromagnetic size of these correlations is less than that of the proton @xcite  @xmath68_{0^+ } } \\approx 0.7\\,{\\rm fm}$ ] , which implies @xmath69 based on the @xmath70-meson/@xmath71-meson radius - ratio @xcite .    the faddeev equation s kernel is completed by specifying that the quarks are dressed , with two of the three dressed - quarks correlated always as a colour-@xmath63 diquark . binding is then effected by the iterated exchange of roles between the bystander and diquark - participant quarks .",
    "a ward - takahashi - identity - preserving electromagnetic current for the baryon thus constituted is subsequently derived  @xcite .",
    "it depends on the electromagnetic properties of the axial - vector diquark correlation .",
    "a study of the nucleon s mass and the effect on this of a pseudoscalar meson cloud are detailed in @xcite .",
    "lessons learnt were employed in a series of studies of nucleon properties , including form factors @xcite .",
    "the calculated ratio @xmath72 passes through zero at @xmath73gev@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the analogous ratio for the neutron was calculated @xcite . in the neighbourhood of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the neutron s electric radius .",
    "the evolution of @xmath72 and @xmath77 on @xmath78gev@xmath28 are both primarily determined by the quark - core of the nucleon .",
    "while the proton ratio decreases uniformly on this domain @xcite , the neutron ratio increases steadily until @xmath79gev@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "weighted nucleon pauli / dirac form factor ratio , calculated using the framework of ref.@xcite and presented with @xmath80gev : solid curve  neutron ; dashed curve  proton .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a form factor ratio motivated by ideas from perturbative qcd @xcite is depicted in fig.[nf2f1 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is interpreted as a mass - scale that defines the upper - bound on the domain of so - called soft momenta in the perturbative analysis .",
    "a plausible value for such a quantity is @xmath81 @xcite.gev corresponds to a length - scale @xmath82fm and it is not credible that perturbative qcd is applicable at ranges greater than the proton s radius . ]",
    "it is interesting that the model of ref.@xcite yields neutron and proton ratios which cross at @xmath83gev@xmath28 .",
    "the model s prediction for truly asymptotic momenta is currently being explored .    stimulated by the possibility that nature s fundamental `` constants",
    "'' might actually exhibit spatial and temporal variation @xcite , we have begun to explore the current - quark - mass - dependence of the nucleon magnetic moments .",
    "this complements work on hadron @xmath84-terms @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for the quark - core contribution to this variation can be expressed through the following ratios evaluated at the physical current - quark mass : @xmath85 it is likely that pseudoscalar meson contributions will increase these values by a factor of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) can only be veraciously understood in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the dses provide a natural vehicle for the exploration of these phenomena .",
    "dcsb is a singularly effective mass generating mechanism . for light - quarks it far outweighs the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is understood via qcd s gap equation , which delivers a quark mass function with a momentum - dependence that connects the perturbative domain with the nonperturbative , constituent - quark domain .",
    "the existence of a sensible truncation scheme enables the proof of exact results using the dses . that the truncation scheme is also tractable means",
    "the results can be illustrated , and furnishes a practical tool for the prediction of observables .",
    "the consequent opportunities for rapid feedback between experiment and theory brings within reach an intuitive understanding of nonperturbative strong interaction phenomena .",
    "it can be argued that confinement is expressed in the analyticity properties of dressed schwinger functions . to build understanding",
    "it is essential to work toward an accurate map of the confinement force between light - quarks and elucidate if / how that evolves from the potential between two static quarks . among the rewards",
    "are a clear connection between confinement and dcsb , an accounting of the distribution of mass within hadrons , and a realistic picture of hybrids and exotics .",
    "it is important to understand the relationship between parton properties on the light - front and the rest frame structure of hadrons .",
    "this is a challenge because , e.g. , it is difficult to see how dcsb , a keystone of low - energy qcd , can be realised on the light - front .",
    "parton distribution functions must be calculated in order to learn their content .",
    "parametrisation is insufficient",
    ". it would be very interesting to know how , if at all , the distribution functions of a goldstone mode differ from those of other hadrons .",
