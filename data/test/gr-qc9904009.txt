    "the numerical evolution of neutron stars in full general relativity has been the focus of many research groups in recent years @xcite .",
    "so far , these studies have been limited to initially non - rotating stars .",
    "however , the numerical investigation of many interesting astrophysical applications , such as the rotational evolution of proto - neutron stars and merged neutron stars or the simulation of gravitational radiation from unstable pulsation modes , requires the ability of accurate long - term evolutions of rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we thus present here the first study of hydrodynamical evolutions of rotating neutron stars in the approximation of a static spacetime .",
    "this approximation allows us to evolve relativistic matter for a much longer time than present coupled spacetime plus hydrodynamical evolution codes .",
    "since the pulsations of neutron stars are mainly a hydrodynamical process , the exclusion of the spacetime dynamics has only a limited effect and allows for qualitative conclusions to be drawn .",
    "the rotational evolution of neutron stars can be affected by several instabilities ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if hot protoneutron stars are rapidly rotating , they can undergo a dynamical bar - mode instability @xcite . when the neutron star has cooled to about @xmath1k after its formation",
    ", it can be subject to the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability @xcite and it becomes an important source of gravitational waves .",
    "it was recently found that the @xmath2 @xmath0-mode has the shortest growth time of the instability @xcite and it can transform a rapidly rotating newly - born neutron star to a crab - like slowly - rotating pulsar within about a year after its formation @xcite . in this model , there are two important questions still to be answered @xcite : what is the maximum amplitude that an unstable @xmath0-mode can reach ( limited by nonlinear saturation ) and is there any transfer of energy to other stable or unstable modes via non - linear couplings ?",
    "such questions can not be answered by computations of normal modes of the linearized pulsation equations , but require non - linear effects to be taken into account .",
    "we therefore need to develop the capability of full non - linear numerical evolutions of rotating stars in general relativity .",
    "our present 2-d ( axisymmetric ) code uses high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) finite - difference schemes for the numerical integration of the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review of applications of hrsc schemes in relativistic hydrodynamics ) . in a similar context to the one presented here",
    "let us note that such schemes have been succesfully used before in the study of the numerical evolution and gravitational collapse of non - rotating neutron stars in 1-d @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , based on pseudospectral methods , has been presented in @xcite .",
    "using our code in 1-d time - evolutions we can accurately identify specific normal modes of pulsation . in 2-d",
    "the code is suitable for the evolution of rotating stars , with the additional complication of having to pay special attention to an angular momentum - loss at the ( non - spherical ) surface of the star , as we will show below .",
    "our initial models are fully relativistic , stationary and axisymmetric configurations , rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the metric in quasi - isotropic coordinates @xcite is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are metric functions ( gravitational units are implied ) . in the non - rotating limit the above metric reduces to the metric of spherical relativistic stars in isotropic coordinates .",
    "we assume a perfect fluid , zero - temperature equation of state ( eos ) , for which the energy density is a function of pressure only .",
    "the following relativistic generalization of the newtonian polytropic eos is chosen : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 is the energy density , @xmath12 is the rest - mass density , @xmath13 is the polytropic constant and @xmath14 is the polytropic exponent .",
    "the initial equilibrium models are computed using a numerical code by stergioulas & friedman @xcite which follows the komatsu , eriguchi & hatchisu @xcite method ( as modified in @xcite ) with some changes for improved accuracy ( see @xcite for a comparison with other codes ) .",
    "the code is freely available and can be downloaded from the following url address : http://www.gravity.phys.uwm.edu/code/rns .",
    "the equations of ( ideal ) relativistic hydrodynamics are obtained from the local conservation laws of density current , @xmath15 and stress - energy , @xmath16 @xmath17 with @xmath18 for a general eos @xmath19 .",
    "this choice of the stress - energy tensor limits our study to perfect fluids .    in the previous expressions @xmath20",
    "is the covariant derivative , @xmath21 is the fluid 4-velocity and @xmath22 is the specific enthalpy @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the specific internal energy , related to the energy density @xmath11 by @xmath25    with an appropriate choice of matter fields the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics constitute a ( non - strictly ) hyperbolic system and can be written in a flux conservative form , as was first shown in @xcite for the one - dimensional case .",
    "the knowledge of the characteristic fields of the system allows the numerical integration to be performed by means of advanced high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) schemes , using approximate riemann solvers ( godunov - type methods ) .",
    "the multidimensional case was studied in @xcite , within the framework of the 3 + 1 formulation .",
    "further extensions of this work to account for _ dynamical _ spacetimes , described by the full set of einstein s non - vacuum equations , can be found in @xcite .",
    "fully _ covariant _ formulations of the hydrodynamic equations ( i.e. , not restricted to _ spacelike _ approaches ) and also adapted to godunov - type methods , are presented in @xcite .    in the present work we use the hydrodynamic equations as formulated in @xcite .",
    "specializing for the metric given by eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , the 3 + 1 quantities read @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lapse function ( the tilde is used to avoid confussion with the metric potential @xmath7 ) and @xmath28 is the azimuthal shift .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are written as a first - order flux conservative system of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the state vector of evolved quantities , the radial and polar fluxes and the source terms .",
    "more precisely , they take the form @xmath32 the source terms can be decomposed in the following way @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , \\tilde{\\alpha}\\left[t^{\\mu t}\\frac{\\partial\\log\\tilde{\\alpha } } { \\partial x^{\\mu } } - t^{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^t_{\\mu\\nu}\\right]\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 .",
    "the definitions of the evolved quantities in terms of the  primitive \" variables ( @xmath37 ) are @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the relativistic lorentz factor @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the 3-velocity components are obtained from the spatial components of the 4-velocity in the following way @xmath42 explicit expressions for the non - vanishing christoffel symbols for metric  ( [ metric ] ) , appearing in the source terms of the hydrodynamic equations , are presented in @xcite .",
    "as stated before , our numerical integration of system ( [ hydro_system ] ) is based on godunov - type methods ( also known as hrsc schemes ) . in a hrsc scheme",
    ", the knowledge of the characteristic fields ( eigenvalues ) of the equations , together with the corresponding eigenvectors , allows for accurate integrations , by means of either exact or approximate riemann solvers , along the fluid characteristics . these solvers , which constitute the kernel of our numerical algorithm , compute , at every interface of the numerical grid , the solution of local riemann problems ( i.e. , the simplest initial value problem with discontinuous initial data ) .",
    "hence , hrsc schemes automatically guarantee that physical discontinuities appearing in the solution , e.g. , shock waves , are treated consistently ( the _ shock - capturing _ property ) .",
    "hrsc schemes are also known for giving stable and sharp discrete shock profiles .",
    "they have also a high order of accuracy , typically second order or more , in smooth regions of the solution .",
    "we perform the time update of system ( [ hydro_system ] ) according to the following conservative algorithm : @xmath43 index @xmath44 represents the time level and the time ( space ) discretization interval is indicated by @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the  hat \" in the fluxes is used to denote the so - called numerical fluxes which , in a hrsc scheme , are computed according to some generic flux - formula , of the following functional form ( suppressing index @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 notice that the numerical flux is computed at cell interfaces ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicate the left and right sides of a given interface .",
    "quantities @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath0 denote the eigenvalues , the jump of the characteristic variables and the eigenvectors , respectively , computed at the cell interfaces according to some suitable average of the state vector variables .",
    "generic expressions for the characteristic speeds and eigenfields can be found in @xcite .",
    "our code has the ability of using different approximate riemann solvers : the roe solver @xcite , widely employed in fluid dynamics simulations , with arithmetically averaged states and the marquina solver @xcite , which has been extended to relativity in @xcite .",
    "the computations presented here were obtained using marquina s scheme .    a technical remark : the equilibrium star is supplemented by a low - density uniform atmosphere , which is necessary for computing non - singular solutions of the hydrodynamic equations everywhere in the computational domain .",
    "after each time - step we reset the atmosphere s density and pressure to their initial values , avoiding unwanted accretion of matter onto the star .",
    "the influence of the atmosphere is thus restricted to the surface grid - cells .",
    "since our code uses spherical polar coordinates , it can also be employed to study the evolution of non - rotating stars in 1-d . in the evolution of initially static non - rotating stars , we observe the following properties ( note that our numerical grid is eulerian ) :    1 .",
    "small - amplitude radial pulsations are triggered by the truncation errors of the finite - differencing scheme .",
    "the radial pulsations are dominated by a set of discrete frequencies , which correspond to the normal modes of pulsation of the star .",
    "the numerical viscosity of the finite - difference scheme damps the pulsations and the damping is stronger for the higher frequency modes .",
    "the presence of a constant density atmosphere affects the finite differencing at the surface grid - cells , which increases the numerical damping of pulsations and also causes a continuous but very small drifting of the density distribution .",
    "the initial amplitude of the radial pulsations and the small drift in density converge to zero at a second order rate with increasing resolution .",
    "the value of the density in the atmosphere region has a large effect on the damping of the pulsations .",
    "if it is too large , the damping is strong . to minimize this effect",
    ", we typically set the density of the atmosphere equal to @xmath54 times the density of the last grid point inside the star .",
    "we study the numerical evolution of a nonrotating @xmath55 relativistic polytrope with @xmath56 .",
    "the star is immediately set into radial pulsation , triggered by the finite difference truncation errors .",
    "the time - evolution of the radial velocity @xmath57 , computed at 25% of the star radius using a grid of 400 zones , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nonrot1 ] .",
    "the vertical axis is dimensionless ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the radial velocity is initially a very complex function of time .",
    "as we will show next , the pulsation consists mainly of a superposition of normal modes of oscillation of the fluid .",
    "the high frequency normal modes are damped quickly and after 20ms the star pulsates mostly in lowest frequency modes . because these oscillations are caused only by the truncation errors ,",
    "the magnitude of the radial velocity is extremely small . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nonrot1 ] it is only a few times larger than the non - zero residual velocity around which the star is oscillating .",
    "this residual velocity converges to zero as second order with increased resolution .",
    "the small - amplitude radial pulsations in the non - linear , fixed spacetime evolutions correspond to linear normal modes of pulsation in the relativistic cowling approximation , in which perturbations of the spacetime are ignored .",
    "a fourier transform of the density or radial velocity time - evolution can be used to identify the normal mode frequencies .",
    "[ fig_nonrot2 ] shows the fourier transform of the radial velocity evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nonrot1 ] .",
    "the normal mode frequencies stand out as sharp peaks on a continuous background .",
    "the width of the peaks increases with frequency .",
    "the frequencies of radial pulsations identified from fig . [ fig_nonrot2 ] are shown in table [ tab_radial1 ] .    to compare the obtained frequencies to linear normal mode frequencies",

    "[ tab_radial1 ] we present the results of this comparison .",
