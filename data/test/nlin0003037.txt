    "we apply this general theory assuming @xmath11 to be unitary and of finite dimension @xmath12 .",

    "if @xmath16 is unitary , @xmath20 is self reversive , meaning that its coefficients satisfy _ n - j(k )  =  ( -1)^n      this condition alone forces the eigenvalues of @xmath11 at fixed @xmath13 to be symmetric with respect to the unit circle : if @xmath10 is an eigenvalue , then @xmath21 is an eigenvalue too . of course",

    "these formulae relate @xmath20 with the traces of powers of @xmath16 which , in turn are related semiclassically to periodic orbits and to the smoothed density of states @xcite .",
