    "simulations of lattice qcd use either the quenched or the partially quenched approximations , where internal fermion loops are omitted or at least suppressed by giving the dynamical ( ` sea ' ) quarks a mass heavier than that of the propagating ( ` current ' ) quarks @xcite .",
    "such an approximation turns out to be necessary , since presently available update algorithms with dynamical fermions tend to slow down rather dramatically if the fermion mass is taken light . from a physical point of view",
    "this unwanted feature does not come as a surprise , as it reflects the very nonlocal nature of the fermion determinant .",
    "the quenched and the partially quenched approximations amount thus to a suppression or reduction of the nonlocal self - interaction of the gluon configuration brought by the sea quarks .",
    "though this seems reasonable , there are specific problems brought by the quenched and to a milder extent the partially quenched approximations : it has been noted very early that quenched qcd lacks reflection positivity @xcite which is just the euclidean analog of unitarity .",
    "this means that green s functions computed in the quenched theory can not be rotated back to minkowski space and hence there is no hamiltonian formulation .",
    "attempts to construct a low - energy theory adapted to the quenched and partially quenched approximations have shown that these constructs give rise to unphysical degrees of freedom which persist in low energy observables and render the whole theory sick , if the chiral limit is taken @xcite .",
    "the computational overhead , though , of full qcd with phenomenological quark masses is so dramatic that without tremendous progress at the algorithmic front both the quenched and the partially quenched approximations are likely to stay with us for the foreseeable future .",
    "since the ultimate goal simulating full qcd is fixed , any potential alternative to the standard path ` quenched  partially quenched  full qcd ' can only imply a different starting point and/or a different way to interpolate between the measure one starts with and the full one . ideally , one would like to begin with a measure which keeps costs per configuration essentially at the quenched level , but tries to incorporate as much of the fermion dynamics brought by the functional determinant as possible .",
    "a specific attempt in this direction goes with the name ` topologically unquenched qcd ' @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to split the functional determinant into two factors @xmath3 the first of which is computationally cheap and as good an approximation to the whole determinant as possible .",
    "this factor is then absorbed into the measure .",
    "on the other hand , the right hand factor is too expensive to be determined for each link update and henceforth this second factor is either discarded of or just included into the observable .",
    "of course , this concept can only work if it is possible to come up with a simple ( i.e.  computationally cheap to evaluate ) and reasonably accurate choice for the first factor .    in the original publication",
    "@xcite it was proposed to define the first factor as the determinant of a suitably chosen background which shares with the actual configuration nothing but the overall topological charge .",
    "below two modifications are proposed , but the basic concept remains the same : the first factor in ( [ detfac ] ) is nothing but a statistical guess of the total determinant which uses as input only global gluonic quantities . the first suggested change concerns the size of the database the guess is based on . originally the idea was to compute the first factor in each topological sector once  on a well chosen configuration @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was already mentioned that in practice it proves useful to construct the guess as the geometric average of the determinants of few configurations which are quite typical both in their gauge action and in the logarithm of their determinant .",
    "here it is suggested to feed the database with the combination @xmath4 for each ` complete ' configuration , i.e.  after the entire lattice has been swept through a few times .",
    "the point is that the ` complete ' configurations are those which are used for measurements , i.e.  those in which the determinant emerges as a byproduct of the dirac operator inversion and thus comes for free . ] .",
    "the second suggested change concerns the argument being used to ` read out ' the guess for the first factor in ( [ detfac ] ) from the database .",
    "the original proposal was to make a guess based on @xmath0 only . in the present work it is eventually proposed to use the combined input from @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the basic idea is still , when a specific link update is proposed , _ not to compute _ the change in the determinant implied , but rather to use the databases knowledge regarding the determinant ratio the proposed change in the gluon configuration brings _ on average_. the original task to compute , for each local link update , a _ global fermionic _",
    "quantity is thus traded for the task to compute the actual change in one or two _ global gluonic _ quantities .",
    "the latter , however , reduces to the stunningly simple task to determine , for each link update , one or two _ local gluonic _ quantities , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 can easily be kept track of by computing , for each proposed update , the corresponding contribution from the staple around the link under consideration , before and after it is modified . in other words ,",
    "the connection between the desired global quantity and the readily accessible local gluonic quantity is made via a two - step procedure : the database stores the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. on a global - to - global basis . in an updating sweep the actual value of these integrated quantities is constantly kept track of   a task which , at any time , requires only looking at the lattice versions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the immediate neighborhood of the link under consideration .",
    "the price to pay is that the guess for the change in the determinant the proposed link update would bring about is not accurate but only correct on average .    from this outline",
    "it is clear that the concept can only work if there is a correlation in fact , for practical purposes , a sufficiently strong correlation between the logarithm of the determinant and , on the other side , the combination of topological index and gluonic action of a configuration generated in a monte carlo process .",
    "in addition , a few practical issues must be resolved , e.g. the question how each configuration can be assigned a topological index in a such a way that the costs ( in terms of cpu time ) for its determination are small compared to the savings from the fewer determinant evaluations .",
    "while the idea of ` topologically unquenched qcd ' was originally put forth  @xcite and successively advertised  @xcite with a strong focus on theoretical aspects ( merely arguing that in the continuum a correlation between the functional determinant and the topological index is to be expected from the instanton liquid model  @xcite ) , a fair assessment of its potential can only come from a practical test . since it is desirable to have direct comparison to simulation data obtained with an exact algorithm in the full theory , a first account may well stem from a test implementation in a suitable model field theory .    a toy theory where the issue of ` topological unquenching ' can be studied without having to worry about many technical aspects of the implementation ( which do indeed matter in qcd ) is the massive multi - flavour schwinger model , i.e.  qed(2 ) with @xmath9 light degenerate fermions .",
    "the physics of this theory resembles in many aspects qcd(4 ) slightly _ above the phase transition _ ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited in the second of them ) , i.e.  the chiral condensate vanishes ( in the chiral limit ) and the expectation value for the polyakov loop is real and positive .",
    "like in qcd the gauge fields in the continuum version of the schwinger model quantized on the torus fall into topologically distinct classes @xcite , i.e.  they can be attributed a topological index .",
    "the latter agrees with the number of left- minus right - handed zero - modes of the massless dirac operator , i.e.  the index theorem holds true .",
    "a closer look reveals , however , that there is no precise analog of the instanton , i.e.  no topologically nontrivial solution which is both a local minimum of the classical action and localized in space - time .",
    "there are ` instantons ' , i.e.  topologically nontrivial minima of the classical action , but they are completely delocalized . on the other hand , there are ` vortices ' , i.e.  topologically nontrivial localized objects , but they do not represent local minima of the classical action .",
    "an obvious consequence for the intended test is that ` topological unquenching ' can only work here , if it relies only on very general features , shared by a broad class of qcd inspired theories .    in order to test the ` topological unquenching ' idea , i have chosen to implement the schwinger model with 2 dynamical staggered fermions both with the full and with the ` topologically unquenched ' measure , as well as the quenched approximation . in all three cases the unimproved gauge action @xmath10 has been used . to compare the three theories to each other 2000/4000/4000 ( full/ topologically unquenched/ quenched ) independent configurations",
    "have been generated on a lattice with volume @xmath11 with periodic / thermal boundary conditions .",
    "the common coupling is @xmath12 and the fermion mass is @xmath13 ( everything in lattice units ) .",
    "these values are chosen such that the ` pion ' ( pseudo - scalar iso - triplet ) has a mass has the dimension of a mass and , unlike in qcd , the power by which @xmath14 depends on @xmath15 is specific for @xmath16 , the general formula is @xmath17 . ]",
    "@xmath18 as to fit into the box .",
    "the formula used is the prediction by the bosonized ( strong - coupling ) version of the theory ( see refs .  cited in @xcite ) , which seems adequate , as @xmath19 .",
    "since the staggered dirac operator is represented by a small ( @xmath20 ) matrix with 5 entries per row or column , i have decided to compute the determinants exactly , using the routines zgefa and zgedi from the linpack package .",
    "finally , since the staggered formulation has a remnant degeneracy , a square root ( in two dimensions ) must be taken to get an object associated with @xmath21 in the continuum .",
    "for the topological charge , i have implemented both the lscher geometric definition @xmath22 and the rescaled naive @xmath23 with @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "a configuration is assigned an index and used for measurements only if the geometric and the naive definition , after rounding to the nearest integer , agree  which , at @xmath25 , holds true for more than @xmath26 of all configurations .",
    "this fraction being so high means that in practice an assignment can be done _ without cooling _ by simply taking @xmath27 and rounding it to the nearest integer @xmath28 .",
    "of course , this means that some configurations are assigned an index which , strictly speaking , are nt continuum - like enough as to have one , but , since the latter fraction is so tiny , such a simple definition may be tried first .",
    "+   +     +   +     +   +    in order to find out whether the ` topological unquenching ' shortcut has a chance to provide a reasonable approximation to the full theory it seems useful to check whether the underpinning assumption a correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath29 holds true in the full theory . the result which merely extends work initiated in the literature @xcite is shown in figs .  1 and  2 .",
    "from the scatter plots one notices that @xmath27 tends to accumulate near integer values , both in the full and the quenched theories .",
    "the obvious difference is that @xmath30 reaches up to  3 in the quenched approximation , but up to  2 in the full theory , i.e.  quenching results in a broadening of the distribution of topological indices if @xmath31 is kept fixed .",
    "the center of the clouds representing the gauge action in a given topological sector shifts upwards , if @xmath30 increases .",
    "regarding the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 one realizes that the center of the clouds at @xmath32 in the central plot on the l.h.s .  of fig .",
    "1 is substantially higher than the center of the cloud at @xmath33 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same correlation holds true even in the quenched approximation , as one can see from the central plot on the r.h.s .  of fig .  1 .",
    "the difference is just that in the quenched updating process this information hasnt been made use of . in order to assess the shifts on a more quantitative level",
    ", the same information is presented in figs .  2 and  3 in the form of histograms for the full and the quenched theories , respectively .",
    "they show the distribution of the gauge action [ per plaquette ] , of @xmath34 times the logarithm of the staggered determinant [ per plaquette , after an overall shift to have it centered at zero in the topologically trivial sector ] and of the weighted sum [ first plus twice the second , @xmath35 . the latter quantity represents the total action the full sample was generated with , while in the quenched case it is an artificial construct .",
    "considering the situation in the full theory first ( fig .",
    "2 ) , one realizes that going from a configuration with @xmath33 to another one with @xmath36 the gauge action per plaquette increases , on average , by 0.0134 , 0.0213 . in the same transition minus the log of the single - flavour determinant per plaquette increases , on average , by 0.0082 , 0.0157 .",
    "hence in the simulation with a staggered pair the total action increases by 0.0299 , 0.0527 .",
    "this means that in the full theory the functional determinant is more efficient in suppressing the higher topological sectors than the gauge action .",
    "considering the analogous shifts in the quenched run ( fig 3 . ) , a transition @xmath37 increases the gauge action per plaquette by 0.0038 , 0.0309 .",
    "simultaneously the sign - flipped logarithm of the single - flavour determinant per plaquette increases by 0.0032 , 0.0100 . in spite of numerical values being",
    "somewhat different , the basic phenomenon happens to be the same in either theory : going from the lowest to the highest sector , only the shift in the distribution of the log of the determinant is comparable to its total width , the shift in the gauge action is almost negligible on the scale of its total width . hence the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath30 seems to be a robust phenomenon superseeding the choice of measure in the functional integral .",
    "+    from the discussion above it is clear that knowing the topological index @xmath28 of a configuration allows for a ( modestly accurate ) ` guess ' of its functional determinant .",
    "if , in addition , a correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath1 holds true , a more accurate guess would become possible .",
    "the result of an investigation in the full theory on this topic is shown in fig .",
    "the first three plots show the sign - flipped logarithm of the single - flavour determinant ( normalized per plaquette ) as a function of the gauge action ( per plaquette ) for @xmath38 .",
    "one finds that within a given topological sector these two quantities are indeed correlated .",
    "besides the vertical shift discussed above , a transition @xmath39 implies a slight reduction in the slope of the regression line . from this one",
    "concludes that , to a first approximation , the functional determinant leads to a _ reweighting of the topological sectors _ and to a _ sectorally different renormalization of @xmath31_. the last plot in fig .",
    "4 shows that , without separation into different topological sectors , the correlation is weaker and the statement that the functional determinant results in an overall - renormalization of @xmath31 is less useful .",
    "a practical issue in a ` topologically unquenched ' simulation is the strategy adopted for building up the databases knowledge about @xmath40 as function of @xmath28 in the simple form of the method or as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath41 in the more elaborate form .",
    "the point is that the desired correlation parameters [ offset and slope in the linear dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath41 for fixed @xmath28 ] are those in the full theory , but doing first a run with the full measure is , of course , not an option .",
    "the practical answer is that the ` topologically unquenched ' algorithm builds up knowledge about the situation as it emerges in the ` topologically unquenched ' run itself .",
    "first one starts with a quenched pre - pre - thermalization , thereby acquiring knowledge about offsets and slopes in the quenched theory .",
    "+    next follows a pre - thermalization phase where the number of ` topologically active ' flavours increases , by small fractional steps , from zero to the desired number of dynamical flavours .",
    "accordingly , the databases values for offsets and slopes will tend closer towards those appropriate in the full theory . finally , the system is given time to thermalize with the true number of ` topologically unquenched ' flavours , before actual measurements take place .",
    "5 shows the offsets for the centers of the distributions of the gauge action , the sign - flipped logarithm of the single - flavour functional determinant and the total action in a ` topologically unquenched ' 2-flavour system , data being collected during the measurement phase .",
    "as expected , numerical values lie in between those in the quenched and in the full theory ( see figs .  2 and  3 ) .",
    "in order to assess the implications for physics the ` topological unquenching ' idea brings about , the static quark - antiquark potential has been determined using the full , the quenched and the ` topologically unquenched ' measure .",
    "+   +    in the latter case , the more elaborate version has been used , i.e.  the database keeps track of the best linear fit for @xmath40 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath41 .",
    "the result is presented in the l.h.s .  of fig .",
    "as one can see , the quenched potential raises linearly short - distance tail . ] , while in the full theory the test charges get seriously screened at large distance .",
    "the ` topologically unquenched ' recipe generates a sample in between ; the potential as it emerges from the unaltered sample shows insufficient yet nontrivial screening at long distances .",
    "what constitutes the primary difference between the samples is shown in the r.h.s .  of fig .  6 : the distribution of @xmath27 is much broader in the quenched chase ( middle ) than in the full theory ( top ) , while",
    "the ` topologically unquenched ' run ( bottom ) nearly reproduces the full distribution .    up to this point the option of eventually including the ` correction factor ' [ i.e.  the @xmath43-fold power of the second factor in ( [ detfac ] ) ] into the observable has not been used .",
    "an attempt to reconstruct the potential in the full theory from the ` topologically unquenched ' sample by including this factor into the observable yields the result shown in the l.h.s .  of fig .  7 .",
    "a detailed comparison shows that the potential agrees ( within error bars ) with the one obtained from the full sample .",
    "the only difference between the first plots in fig .",
    "6 and  7 is a technical one : the full potential reconstructed from the ` topologically unquenched ' sample was cheaper , in terms of cpu time , by a factor @xmath44 than the one won from the full sample .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that it was not clear a priori that including the correction factor into the observable would be an option .",
    "the point is that the correction factor is the ratio of two determinants each of which scales exponentially with the total lattice volume .",
    "this means that the extra fluctuations brought by the ` correction factor ' grow exponentially as the lattice gets large . in the present example",
    "the distribution of the log of the correction factor is sufficiently narrow as to allow for a reconstruction of the full potential .",
    "as one can see from the r.h.s .  of fig .",
    "7 the majority of the configurations has a log between -3.2 and 0.0 , i.e.  most configurations receive a reweighting factor between @xmath45 and 1 . at fixed @xmath46",
    "this width grows linearly with @xmath47 , thus making such a reweighting impossible for sufficiently large @xmath47 .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that even on a large lattice the part of the functional determinant which has been absorbed into the ` topologically unquenched ' measure results for most observables in an improvement on the quenched approximation ( see fig .",
    "6 again ) .",
    "an extreme ` counterexample ' where the part of the functional determinant which has been absorbed into the ` topologically unquenched ' measure does not result in any improvement at all is shown in fig .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov line is still zero , like in the quenched theory , whereas in the full theory it is real and positive . in this case",
    "the entire shift between the quenched and the full theories emerges from the factor which , in the ` topological unquenching ' framework , is considered a ` correction factor ' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this particular test is extremely hard to pass , because the difference between the quenched and the full theories is much more severe than in the case of qcd .",
    "this holds true because the quenched schwinger model is always in the confined phase , while the full multiflavour schwinger model is always in the deconfined phase ",
    "regardless of the actual temperature . in other words : the effect of the determinant in the massive multiflavour schwinger model is not merely renormalizing masses and lengths ; quenching results in qualitative changes for any values of @xmath46 , making it a more drastic approximation than in qcd .",
    "+    it is interesting to elucidate the physical reason why at least for the standard observable of the heavy quark potential ` topological unquenching ' results in a substantial improvement of the behaviour at long distance . to this end",
    "the configurations generated in the full theory have been re - analyzed in different classes , according to the absolute value of their topological index @xmath28 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "9 , the ` sectoral ' potentials for @xmath48 and @xmath49 differ quite drastically . comparing the l.h.s .  of fig .",
    "9 to the first plot in fig .",
    "6 one notices that the sectoral potential with @xmath48 almost agrees with the unseparated ` true ' potential .",
    "the big surprise , however , is that the error bars are smaller now , even though the ` topologically trivial ' potential emerges from a subset of the configurations used for the full potential .",
    "it seems that in this particular case the higher sectors primarily add some ` noise ' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the topologically trivial sector does not always yield the right result . in a previous run in a ( physically ) larger box ,",
    "the ` topologically trivial ' potential was found to lie substantially below the true potential @xcite , i.e.  a strict constraint to the trivial sector would not always prove beneficial .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation in qcd with @xmath50 , where leutwyler and smilga have shown that in a sufficiently small box ( @xmath51 ) the partition function is dominated by the topologically trivial sector , whereas in a sufficiently large box ( @xmath52 ) a global quantity like @xmath0 has vanishing influence on physical variables @xcite . in this language",
    "the current simulation is in the regime @xmath53 whereas the previous one @xcite should likely be associated should be traded for @xmath54 . ] with @xmath55 . from the combined simulation data it is natural to conjecture that , if the box - volume increases gradually so as to leave the regime @xmath53 , _ several mutually inconsistent sectors _ start to yield _ sizable contributions _ ; only as @xmath56 goes beyond  1 , the differences between the sectoral contributions start fading away",
    ". since the regime @xmath57 is not uncommon in current lattice simulations , it seems desirable to respect the relative weight of the different topological sectors in the full theory  even if importance sampling is done w.r.t .  to a different measure .    summarizing our investigations in the massive multiflavour schwinger model",
    ", one might say that the basic concept of ` topological unquenching ' including the first factor in ( [ detfac ] ) into the measure results for several observables in a substantial improvement on the quenched approximation at virtually no costs , whereas the option of including the second factor into the observable is likely to be limited to very small lattices .",
    "finally , a few comments and speculations on a possible extension of the ` topological unquenching ' idea to qcd are in order .",
    "it is clear that the basic feature the approach relies on a correlation between the logarithm of the determinant and one or several global gluonic quantities which may be kept track of from looking at their respective local changes holds true in the case of qcd too .",
    "what is not so clear is whether this correlation is strong enough as to make this a practical way of guessing the change in the logarithm of the determinant if a link in a phenomenological simulation is updated .",
    "of course , there is the possibility that further quantities , besides @xmath0 and @xmath58 , are found which correlate with the determinants logarithm , thus allowing for a more accurate guess .",
    "an obvious question , however , is which definition for the @xmath59 operator should be chosen on the lattice , since , with any practical implementation , @xmath0 is not an integer .",
    "to make the situation even worse established techniques to render a configuration more continuum - like [ e.g.  blocking inverse - blocking cycles , link fuzzing or cooling ] are known to cause any field - theoretic definition of the topological charge ` jump ' one or several times about roughly integer values until it finally settles close to an integer . from a physical point of view , however , such a stability requirement is not really useful as it leads to a determination of the topological charge in a configuration which agrees in its instanton content with the original one only modulo instantons smaller than a certain critical radius @xmath60 , as discussed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "it is thus preferable to apply as little cooling as possible and to allow for some uncertainty , but to strive for the topological charge of the original configuration . in other words : in the ` topological unquenching ' context there is no need for the peaks and valleys in the @xmath27-distribution to be so much pronounced as in the beautyful plot shown in fig .",
    "any determination which results in a distribution which takes values in the valleys not more than half of the values in the neighboring peaks will do fine for ` topological unquenching ' purposes .",
    "if improved operators are used , both @xmath61 and @xmath59 should be dealt with in comparable manner .",
    "it is believed that even with moderate improvement one or two cooling sweeps will be sufficient to satisfy the valley - peak - criterion for current @xmath31-values . in practical terms",
    "more cooling sweeps would be unpleasant anyways , since 2 cooling sweeps require permanently carrying along the 1- and 2-cooled versions of the actual configuration in order to minimize time spent on local cooling , when an individual link is updated .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the situation improves with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "eventually , for sufficiently high @xmath31 , even the wilson action and the corresponding unimproved @xmath59 operator will satisfy the criterion , thus allowing for a way to keep track of @xmath0 which does not require cooling at all .",
    "regardless of how much local cooling is needed for @xmath31-values used over the next few years , what is important is the following : since the computational overhead of the ` topologically unquenched ' over the quenched approximation stems entirely from local efforts to keep track of the topological charge , costs per configuration get increased by a fixed factor and the number of cooling cycles . with 2 sweeps and not more than next - to - nearest neighbor couplings , it might be @xmath62 . ] which is independent of the size of the lattice .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the effect of accidental ` misidentifications ' of the topological charge on the ` topologically unquenched ' sample : in the extreme case where the charge determination yields a normal distributed random number which has nothing to do with the actual configuration the simple version of the algorithm finds no correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 and produces , for this reason , a quenched sample . under the same circumstances the more elaborate version finds just a modest linear correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath58 and produces , for this reason , a quenched sample with an overall - rescaled @xmath31 ( see fig .  4 , last plot ) .",
    "in this paper the idea of ` topological unquenching ' has been transformed into a general scheme applicable to qcd inspired theories : the algorithm tries to ` guess ' the change in the determinant a proposed link update would bring .",
    "this is done using statistical information how the logarithm of the determinant correlates with global gluonic quantities like @xmath63 and @xmath58 which may easily be kept track of by looking at their respective local changes . compared to the quenched approximation ` topological unquenching ' seems to bring considerable improvement if the observable under consideration depends sensitively on the structure of the long - range green s functions in the full theory and if , in addition , the simulation is done in the small ( @xmath64 ) or intermediate ( @xmath65 ) leutwyler smilga regime .",
    "obviously , a test - implementation like the one presented in this study can not prove that the idea of ` topological unquenching ' would be successful in the case of qcd .",
    "nevertheless , the method seems interesting because of its sampling speed and its potential field - theoretic virtues : even an expensive formulation respecting chiral symmetry may be used for the sea - quarks and the latter do naturally have exactly the same mass as the current - quarks .",
    "it is hoped that these features look promising enough as to persuade at least one lattice group to give ` topological unquenching ' a try for the case of qcd .",
