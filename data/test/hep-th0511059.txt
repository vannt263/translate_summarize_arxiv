    "the noncommutative chern - simons theory has been intensively studied during the last years . among the most important results obtained",
    "so far are the vanishing of the ultraviolet / infrared ( uv / ir ) infrared divergences for the pure chern - simons theory @xcite and the quantization of the chern - simons coefficient @xcite .",
    "there were also some indications that , in the axial gauge , the pure chern - simons theory is actually a free field theory @xcite . besides all these theoretical developments , a relation of noncommutative chern - simons theory to the fractional quantum hall effect has also been pointed @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we investigated various interactions of the noncommutative chern - simons field with the matter with special concern on the existence of dangerous uv / ir singularities . for the supersymmetric model , we found that the cancellation of uv / ir infrared divergences occurs even when matter is included , either in the adjoint or in the fundamental representation ( in the former case , this happens only in a particular gauge ) .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our line of research by looking at two natural extensions of our previous results .",
    "first , we extend the investigations of @xcite to the non - abelian case .",
    "as we shall prove , similarly to other four- and three - dimensional noncommutative supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite , the cancellation of uv / ir singularities , generated in the nonplanar part of the quantum corrections , demands that the gauge group generators are in the fundamental representation of the @xmath0 group .",
    "we recall that this is the same requirement found for the consistency of noncommutative gauge models at the classical level @xcite .",
    "second , we will calculate the finite one - loop quantum corrections to the effective action of the supersymmetric theory ( see @xcite for a similar calculation in the non - supersymmetric case , as well as @xcite for an extensive study of the commutative theory ) . in particular , this will allow us to determine the finite changes in the coefficient of the chern - simons term and the structure of the effective action of the model .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate the finiteness of the pure gauge sector if the generators are in the fundamental representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of matter is considered in section [ sec2 ] where we prove that finiteness in the adjoint representation also requires the gauge superfield to be in a special gauge .",
    "the one loop calculation of the finite contributions to the quadratic part of the effective action is done in section [ sec3 ] .",
