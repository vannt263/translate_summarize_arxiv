    "due to the low average plasma @xmath1 the structure of the corona is determined by the coronal magnetic field .",
    "knowledge of the structure of the coronal magnetic field is therefore of prime importance to understand the physical processes in the solar corona .    at the present time there is no general method available which allows the direct and accurate measurement of the magnetic field at an arbitrary point in the corona , although some progress has been made using radio observations above active regions ( e.g. ) .",
    "we therefore have to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field from measurements taken at photospheric or chromospheric level .    if we want to do this we have to make assumptions about the current density in the corona .",
    "the low average plasma @xmath1 allows us to assume that to lowest order the magnetic field is force - free , i.e. the current density is aligned with the magnetic field . with a few exceptions ( e.g. ;",
    "; ; ; ) , most of the extrapolation and reconstruction methods proposed so far are based on this assumption including the use of potential fields ( @xmath2 ) ( e.g.  ; ; ; ; ) , linear force - free fields ( e.g. ; ; ; ; ; ) and nonlinear force - free fields ( e.g.  ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "ideally , the information contained in a ( perfect ) vector magnetogram together with the force - free condition would be sufficient to calculate the coronal magnetic field .",
    "however , despite the increasing availability of vector magnetogram data , we are still far from this ideal situation due to both the quality of the data and to the difficulty of the calculation .",
    "it is therefore still easier to use line - of - sight magnetograms as input for potential or force - free extrapolation .",
    "potential fields are completely determined by fixing the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field @xcite , but do not necessarily give good fits to observed emission structures . in the case of linear force - free fields , the normal ( e.g. ) or line - of - sight component @xcite is not sufficient to determine the field uniquely and one has the freedom to choose a value for the linear force - free parameter @xmath0 . even though some methods have been suggested to determine @xmath0 by using the ambiguity of the full linear force - free solution to fit vector magnetogram data @xcite , the usual method is to try to choose the value for @xmath0 in such a way that a subset of the field lines matches the observed emission pattern as good as possible ( e.g. ) .",
    "so far , our information about the emitting plasma structures has been largely limited to two - dimensional projections of intrinsically three - dimensional objects .",
    "however , within the next few years the stereo mission will hopefully give us the possibility to get three - dimensional information about the coronal plasma structures , in addition to magnetogram data which are routinely taken by ground- or space - based instruments .",
    "in the present paper we want explore the possibility to determine a value of @xmath0 for a linear force - free field by comparing the reconstructed magnetic field to the observed three - dimensional structure of coronal plasma loops .",
    "this is done by defining one or several three - dimensional curves in space representing the spatial structure of the observed loops , and a mathematical measure of the deviation of the reconstructed magnetic field lines from these three - dimensional space curves .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is then determined by minimising the deviation from the observed loops .",
    "we emphasise that this is to be considered as a first step only and that a generalisation of the method to non - linear force - free fields is planned . as the stereo mission is yet to be launched ,",
    "the method is tested using the loop shapes deducted by from applying dynamic stereoscopy to the solar active region noaa 7986 using soho / mdi and soho / eit data taken on 29 , 30 and 31 august 1996 .",

    "a brief description of the method used to calculate the linear force - free fields is given in section [ constalpha ] .",

    "conclusions and an outlook to future research is given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "our aim is to develop a method of coronal magnetic field reconstruction based on linear force - free fields which uses as input photospheric line - of - sight magnetograms and which optimises the value of the force - free parameter @xmath0 in such way that the resulting field fits the three - dimensional shape of a coronal loop .",

    "the details of these steps used in the method are the following .",

    "the generalisation to several loops is straightforward and will be briefly explained in section [ multiple ] .",

    "we emphasize that the use of @xmath10 as a parameter is only one way of parametrizing the space curve , in this case using a multiple of the loop arc length .",
    "for comparison of @xmath14 with other 3d space curves it makes sense to use the same parameter for the other space curves because it ensures that any measure of the distance ( in the mathematical sense of a norm ) between two curves will vanish if the curves coincide . of course , the parametrisation of the other 3d space curves is in principle completely arbitrary , but we believe that for the methods described in this paper our choice is the most practicable one .    1 .   the observed photospheric ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field @xmath3 is used as boundary condition for the magnetic field calculation",
    "we start by calculating the potential field ( @xmath15 ) corresponding to the given magnetogram .",
    "3 .   at later steps during the iteration @xmath0 will be non - zero and we have to calculate the linear force - free field corresponding to the value of @xmath0 and the boundary condition given by the ( line - of - sight ) magnetogram .",
    "we use the method of for determining the linear force - free field .",
    "details are described in section [ constalpha ] .",
    "4 .   based on the magnetic field @xmath16 calculated in step 3 , we calculate a field line @xmath17 starting on or close to the given stereoscopic loop . in this paper",
    "we have taken either the top of the observed loop or one of the foot - points as starting point for the integration .",
    "we emphasize that the method will also work if the known section of the observed loop does not start at the photosphere . in this case",
    "the integration starts at one end point of the observed loop section and ends at the other end point .",
    "the arc length of the calculated field - line is then normalised to a fixed value @xmath13 corresponding to the length of the observed space curve .",
    "the information about the observed loop in the corona is provided in the form of a three - dimensional space curve @xmath14 .",
    "the arc length of the loop is normalised to the same value ( @xmath13 ) as the field - line calculated in step 4 .",
    "6 .   in this step",
    "the quality of the reconstructed field is assessed by comparing the observed loop and the reconstructed magnetic field . in the ideal both space curves would be identical , but this can not be generally expected due to possible errors in the observations and the fact that only a linear force - free field is used here .",
    "+ in this paper we use two different methods to assess the quality of the reconstructed field and determine an optimal value for @xmath0  : 1 .",
    "a simple way to compare the two space curves is to use one observed foot - point as start - point for calculating @xmath18 and to determine the @xmath0 which minimises the distance between the second foot - point of @xmath19 and @xmath9 , i.e. to minimise @xmath20 ( eric priest , private communication ) . whereas this ensures that one of the foot - points of the two space curves is identical and the other foot - point as close as possible to the observed location , the curves as such could have totally different shapes . +",
    "this method works only if complete loops including the foot points are actually known .",
    "2 .   a more sophisticated way to optimise the magnetic field is to compare the full 3d structure of the observed and one or several reconstructed space curves ( field lines ) .",
    "the reconstructed space curves @xmath18 are determined by first selecting one or several starting points for the field line integration and then integrating the field lines passing through these points numerically .",
    "the starting points for the integration can be either points on the observed loop , e.g. the top or the end points of the observed curve , or other points close by .",
    "we then compare the calculated and the observed curves by integrating their spatial distance along the complete length of the curves from @xmath11 to @xmath12 leading to + @xmath21 the value of @xmath0 for the best fitting field line is then determined by minimising @xmath5 . if several field lines are compared with the same observed curve , the total minimum of all field lines is chosen .",
    "a possible variant not used in the present paper is to minimise the sum of all individual @xmath5 for a set of field lines . + this method",
    "can also be applied to loop sections in cases where the complete loop has not been observed .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the method becomes less and less meaningful with decreasing length of the observed loop sections .",
    "+ @xmath5 as defined above is dimensionless and its value also provides a measure of how much the reconstructed field line and the observed space curve differ for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have normalised @xmath5 to by the length of the observed loop ( or loop section ) so that the values of @xmath22 should be more or less independent of the loop length . in this case values of @xmath22 of the order of or less than unity",
    "indicate good fits , whereas higher values of @xmath5 indicate bad fits .",
    "+ it can be useful to calculate @xmath5 for different values of @xmath0 to determine suitable initial values for a newton iteration to determine the minimum of @xmath5 ( see next step ) .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath0 is determined by minimising @xmath5 .",
    "this is done by calculating the zeros of @xmath23 .",
    "as we are interested in the absolute minimum of @xmath5 the knowledge gained in the previous step is very helpful to see whether there are several minima , and which values of @xmath0 are useful as starting points .",
    "+ @xmath24 and @xmath25 are calculated numerically . if the current @xmath0 minimises @xmath5 ( yes arrow in figure [ algorithm ] )",
    "the optimal linear force - free solution has been found .",
    "+ if the minimum has not been found to within the desired accuracy ( no arrow in figure [ algorithm ] ) , the next iteration step is carried out ( see step 8) .",
    "a new value for @xmath0 is determined by a newton - raphson iteration step @xmath26 this new value for @xmath0 is then used as input for the field solver ( step 3 ) .",
    "the iteration is continued until @xmath5 has been minimised to the desired degree of accuracy .",
    "the resulting magnetic field can be considered as the optimal linear force - free magnetic field under the constraints that it satisfies the boundary conditions given by the magnetogram and that it minimises the difference between a particular field line and the observed loop shape .",
    "we use the method of for calculating the linear force - free field for a given magnetogram and a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "this method gives the components of the magnetic field for a semi - finite column of rectangular cross - section in terms of a fourier series .",
    "the observed magnetogram which covers a rectangular region extending from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in @xmath29 and @xmath27 to @xmath30 in @xmath31 is artificially extended onto a rectangular region covering @xmath32 to @xmath28 and @xmath33 to @xmath30 by taking an antisymmetric mirror image of the original magnetogram in the extended region , i.e. @xmath34",
    "the advantage of taking the antisymmetric extension of the original magnetogram is that the extended magnetogram is automatically flux balanced .",
    "the method has the further advantage that a fast fourier transformation ( fft ) scheme ( see also ) can be used to determine the coefficients of the fourier series . for more details regarding this method see , and a comparison of the performance of the method with other reconstruction methods has been given by .",

    "further fourier coefficients could be taken into account if very small scale structures have to be resolved , which is not the case in the present paper .",
    "we use the si - system throughout the paper , with the exception of the magnetic field strength to which we refer in gauss ( @xmath43 gauss = @xmath44 tesla ) . due to the antisymmetry of the extended magnetogram",

    "in principle the method described in section [ program ] could be tested by using any reasonable three - dimensional space curve as a model loop shape .",
    "however , we considered it more challenging to apply the method to a more realistic situation . before the launch of the stereo mission , true stereoscopic data will not be available , and we therefore used the loop shapes determined by using the method of dynamic stereoscopy .",
    "dynamic stereoscopy uses the solar rotation to get different viewing angles at different observation times to derive the three - dimensional loop shapes .",
    "the fundamental assumption of dynamic stereoscopy is that the shapes of the loop structures vary only very slowly over the period of time of the observations .",

    "in addition we notice that loop 9 is nearly potential and belongs to neither of these subgroups .",
    "we point out that for these loops the foot - point method and the loop distance method lead to similar optimal values of @xmath0 as can be seen by comparing the first and the last two rows of table [ table1 ] .    to assess the possible differences between fitting single loops and groups of several loops ,",
    "we minimised the sum of the individual @xmath22 s over the loop subgroups , @xmath85 , @xmath86 loop number , for both subgroups identified above .",
    "as the loops in the two subgroups are individually fitted best by @xmath0 values with opposite sign , it does not make sense to try and fit both groups simultaneously .",
    "this is an obvious limitation of the method imposed by the linear force - free field extrapolation which can only be overcome by non - linear force - free field extrapolation allowing for a spatial variation of @xmath0 .",
    "we found the optimal values of @xmath87 for subgroup 1 and @xmath88 for subgroup 2 .",
    "as in the individual cases the sign of @xmath89 for the two loop subgroups is different . the value of @xmath0 for subgroup 1 is slightly lower than the average value of the optimal @xmath0 for that subgroup ( @xmath90 ) . for the second subgroup , the optimal value of @xmath0 has to be compared to an average of the individual values of @xmath91 .    .",
    "lower panel : loops 13,16,17,20,21 and fitted magnetic field lines for @xmath88 , width=302 ]    .",
    "lower panel : loops 13,16,17,20,21 and fitted magnetic field lines for @xmath88 , width=302 ]    the values of @xmath76 for the optimal group @xmath0 for each loop in a group are only slightly larger ( about @xmath92 ) than the optimal values for single loop optimisation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the magnetic field close to subgroup 1 can be represented with a reasonable accuracy by a linear force - free field with @xmath87 and the field of subgroup 2 by @xmath88",
    ". a three - dimensional view of the loops and the fitted field lines is shown in figure [ groups ] where the upper panel corresponds to subgroup 1 and the lower panel to subgroup 2 .",
    "the observed loops are indicated by thick lines and the optimised reconstructed field lines by thin lines .    as can be clearly seen in figure [ groups ]",
    "the main difference between the loops in the two subgroups is that all loops in subgroup 1 have a negative inclination angle with the vertical whereas all loops in subgroup 2 have a positive inclination angle ( see also table 1 in ) . as shown above this",
    "corresponds to a positive value of @xmath0 for subgroup 1 and a negative @xmath0 for subgroup 2 .",
    "figure [ groups ] also shows that the two subgroups occupy different spatial regions although their foot points are generally not too far apart .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that all the results presented in this section depend on the circular loop extrapolation used by .",
    "therefore all derived @xmath0 values can be considered only as accurate as the shape of the corresponding loop used for the determination of @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", extrapolations based only on small observed parts of loops have to be regarded with great caution .",
    "however , we were mainly interested in testing our method and under the assumption that the extrapolated loops are correct , the method seems to give consistent results .",
    "in this paper we undertook a first step towards including three - dimensional information from stereoscopic observations into a reconstruction of coronal magnetic fields from photospheric magnetic field measurements . due to the low plasma @xmath1 in the solar corona force - free magnetic fields can be used and in the present paper , we restricted our analysis to linear force - free fields for simplicity .",
    "the extrapolation method uses the line - of - sight photospheric magnetic field as a boundary condition .    as the coronal plasma has a very high conductivity , the magnetic field",
    "is frozen into the plasma .",
    "therefore one can assume that the coronal plasma structures also outline the magnetic field .",
    "this is the fundamental assumption of our method .",
    "the idea of our reconstruction method is to take both the photospheric magnetogram and the three - dimensional stereoscopic information into account to derive the magnetic field configuration in the solar corona .",
    "the magnetogram provides information regarding the strength and the distribution of the magnetic fields , whereas the three - dimensional loop shapes restrict the current density .",
    "the method works iteratively in that we first calculate a magnetic field configuration from the line of sight magnetogram for a given value of @xmath0 without considering the stereoscopic information . to test the configuration we compare a magnetic loop of this magnetic field with the stereoscopic observations .",
    "this can be done in various ways of which we have presented two ( foot - point method and loop distance method ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is then systematically optimised by minimising the difference between the observed and the reconstructed loop shape .",
    "we have applied this method to loops deduced by using the method of dynamic stereoscopy for the active region noaa 7986 observed with soho / mdi and eit on 1996 august 30 . for the future",
    "we are planing to apply our method to data taken by the secchi instrument aboard the stereo mission .",
    "the results obtained for the data are promising , but indicate the need for improving the method further by the use of non - linear force - free fields .",
    "work along these lines is in progress and will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we thank bernd inhester , fabrice portier - fozzani , eric priest and rainer schwenn for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank the referee for insightful comments .",
