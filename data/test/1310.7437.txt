    "with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) successfully running since 2009 , the two mayor experiments , atlas and cms , discovered a new particle compatible with the higgs boson of the standard model , with a mass of 126 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , they have been collecting data and looking for signals beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the case of supersymmetry ,",
    "mainly r - parity conserving models have been considered . among the last ones , in ref .",
    "@xcite a search for supersymmetric events with two leptons ( electrons and/or muons ) was made .",
    "these events are produced from decays of heavy neutralinos or charginos into the lightest neutralino ( lightest supersymmetric particle , lsp ) via a slepton . in a simplified model where the slepton has a mass half way between the heavy neutralino / chargino and the lsp , a 200 gev bound on the chargino mass is obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite a search for neutralino decaying into a gravitino and a photon was performed in an r - parity conserving gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking model .",
    "looking for di - photon events with missing energy , a limit of 805 gev for the gluino mass when the neutralino is heavier than 50 gev was set . in ref .",
    "@xcite a sbottom pair was searched , with each sbottom decaying into a bottom quark and a neutralino .",
    "no signal was observed setting a bound of 60 gev for the neutralino mass and 390 gev for the sbottom mass .",
    "other r - parity conserving searches for supersymmetry can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for atlas and ref .",
    "@xcite for cms",
    ". these results mainly point to upper limits for gluino and squark masses which are starting to reach the 1 tev level .    in the r - parity violating scenario , in ref .",
    "@xcite a displaced vertex is looked for in association with a muon , found in the decay of a neutralino .",
    "the non - observation of an excess placed limits on the production cross section as a function of the neutralino lifetime . in ref .",
    "@xcite a massive particle decaying into an electron and a muon is searched , with no excess found .",
    "this places limits on a stau that decays via trilinear r - parity violating couplings , setting a model dependent lower bound on the stau mass of 1.32 tev . in ref .",
    "@xcite supersymmetry was searched in the channel with jets and an isolated lepton without the observation of an excess .",
    "this was interpreted in the bilinear r - parity violation ( brpv ) model in the tree - level dominance scenario , and exclusion limits where set in the gaugino - scalar mass plane ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for example , the gaugino mass has to be larger than 340 gev for low scalar masses , and for low gaugino masses the scalar mass has a lower bound that reach around 900 gev .",
    "although the lhc experiments have not found evidence for supersymmetry , the available experimental information is ruling out important sectors of the theory , specially where colored particles are light .",
    "at least two mayor scenarios are not challenged yet : split supersymmetry ( ss ) and r - parity violation .",
    "first , in split supersymmetry @xcite all scalar particles are very heavy , with the exception of a sm - like higgs boson .",
    "the idea behind this model is to keep two of the best phenomenological features of supersymmetric theories , namely the unification of gauge couplings and the existence of a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "the price to pay is the abandon of the supersymmetric solution to the naturalness problem .",
    "since squark are not seen yet at the lhc , this scenario acquires strength .",
    "second , although signals for r - parity have been searched for , the constraints are strongly model dependent .",
    "in brpv for example , the search reported in @xcite is interpreted in brpv within the tree - level dominance scenario . in this case ,",
    "tree level contributions to neutrino mass matrix dominates over the one - loop corrections . but",
    "this needs not to be the case , and in other scenarios the interpretation of the search results would have to be re - done .",
    "in fact , in a different scenario the decay of the neutralino into a muon and two jets could be very suppressed .    in the original version of split supersymmetry , where only one higgs doublet remains light ,",
    "it is not sufficient to add brpv to generate acceptable neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "one way to fix this problem would be the inclusion of a gravity motivated term to the neutrino mass matrix @xcite . a different approach is to keep two higgs doublets light with all the sfermions masses at a high scale , scenario known as partial split supersymmetry ( pss ) @xcite . in this scenario , despite the fact that the lightest neutralino is unstable due to the presence of brpv , the gravitino is a viable dark matter candidate @xcite .    in pss , after integrating out the sfermions , new couplings are generated between the gauginos , higgsinos , and light higgs bosons .",
    "these couplings are called @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , and have boundary conditions at the split supersymmetric scale @xmath7 that relate them to the gauge couplings .",
    "they run independently to the weak scale acquiring values that differs from coupling to coupling , running that has been neglected up to now . in this article",
    "we find the rge for these couplings in pss , and estimate the effect they produce in the neutrino observables .",
    "in pss the higgs sector is the same as in the mssm , with two higgs doublets @xmath8 and @xmath9 , each acquiring vacuum expectation values @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the higgs potential is also equal to the one in the mssm .",
    "the presence of brpv implies that the sneutrinos acquire a vev , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , one for each generation of sneutrinos .",
    "if we do not decouple yet the sfermions , the minimization conditions for the scalar potential are the ones in the mssm - brpv model @xcite .",
    "the tadpole condition for the two higgs boson vevs are given by , @xmath14 while the three tadpole conditions associated to the sneutrino vevs are condensed into the following equation , @xmath15 most of the notation in these equations is the usual one , although we note that @xmath16 are the supersymmetric brpv mass terms in the superpotential , and that @xmath17 are the bilinear soft terms associated to the former , analogous to the term @xmath18 which is related to the cp - odd higgs mass @xcite .    in pss sfermions masses",
    "are pushed up to a scale @xmath19 , and eq .",
    "( [ tadpolei ] ) implies that @xmath20 , assuming that the other terms are smaller .",
    "this can be achieved in theoretical models as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the two conditions in eq .",
    "( [ tadpoleud ] ) can be met for a given set of vacuum expectation values if appropriate values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are chosen , solving for these masses in the tadpole conditions . even if the cp - odd higgs mass is larger than @xmath23 ( but much smaller than @xmath7 ) , the first condition in eq .",
    "( [ tadpoleud ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , even in the case where the split supersymmetric scale is very large , eq .",
    "( [ tadpoleud ] ) can be satisfied if @xmath25 .",
    "all these considerations imply that the scalar potential can have a minimum with a given set of vevs for the case of very large sfermion masses , provided the soft mass parameters satisfy the tadpole equations . under these conditions ,",
    "the mass eigenstate sfermions are integrated out .",
    "in particular , the sneutrino mass eigenstates that are integrated out have , by construction , a higgs component .",
    "conversely , the remaining higgs bosons fields at the low scale , have a sneutrino component .",
    "this is crucial for the neutrino mass generation mechanism to work .",
    "now we work in the low energy effective model where the sfermions are integrated out . as in any supersymmetric model with brpv , in pss gauginos and higgsinos mix with neutrinos forming a @xmath26 mass matrix . in the base @xmath27",
    "we group the mass terms in the lagrangian @xmath28 where we divide the mass matrix into four blocks , @xmath29 , \\label{x07x7}\\ ] ] the upper - left block corresponds to the neutralino sector , @xmath30 .",

    "the mixing between neutralinos and neutrinos is given by the block @xmath34.\\ ] ] the relevant terms in the lagrangian that account for this mixing matrix are , @xmath35 where we see the supersymmetric mass parameters @xmath16 , which mix higgsinos with neutrinos . the higgs - gaugino - lepton term proportional to @xmath36",
    "are induced in the low energy theory after the sleptons are integrated out , contributing to the gaugino - neutrino mixing when the higgs acquire a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the nature of the @xmath36 terms can be understood as follows . above the scale @xmath37 the higgs scalars gauge",
    "eigenstates mix with the sneutrinos gauge eigenstates , both the real parts ( cp - even ) and the imaginary parts ( cp - odd ) .",
    "if we call @xmath38 and @xmath39 the component of the @xmath40-th real - part - sneutrino inside the cp - even higgs bosons mass eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , it has been proved that they satisfy @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with analogous relations for the imaginary - part - sneutrinos @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of a non - zero @xmath36 term in eq .",
    "( [ lss2hdmrpv ] ) indicates that the low energy fields we call higgs bosons , in fact have a small sneutrino component .",
    "the sneutrinos are not completely decoupled from the low energy theory below @xmath7 , but continue living inside our higgs bosons .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath36 is proportional to the sneutrino vev , implies that if the @xmath45 breaking is switch off , the @xmath36 disappears .    if eq .",
    "( [ x07x7 ] ) is block diagonalized , a neutrino effective mass matrix is generated , @xmath46 , \\label{treenumass}\\ ] ] with , @xmath47 this matrix , whose matrix elements we denote @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the tree - level contribution in eq .",
    "( [ treenumass ] ) , has only one non - vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "quantum corrections must be included in order to generate a solar as well an atmospheric mass difference .",
    "the quantum corrected neutrino effective mass matrix becomes , @xmath50 the @xmath51 coefficient is generated at one - loop and in pss , with @xmath52 , the important contributions are from loops with neutral higgs bosons , resulting in @xcite @xmath53 in addition , the @xmath54 coefficient receives small one - loop corrections we do not display , and there is a coefficient @xmath55 that mixes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but can be tunned to zero by choosing an appropriate substraction scale .",
    "notice that the neutrino mass terms satisfy the two requisites a majorana neutrino mass should .",
    "first , lepton number is violated , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ lss2hdmrpv ] ) by both terms @xmath16 and @xmath36 .",
    "second , this neutrino mass vanishes in the limit where @xmath45 symmetry is restored , as we see from @xmath58 definition that @xmath59 as @xmath60 , and from eq .",
    "( [ cinpss ] ) that @xmath61 in the same limit .",
    "notice also that the general theorem shown in ref .",
    "@xcite is also satisfied in our model .",
    "the theorem states that for a majorana neutrino mass to be non - zero in a supersymmetric model , a `` majorana '' sneutrino mass should be present also .",
    "this means a mass splitting between the real and imaginary sneutrino masses . remembering that our sneutrinos live in the low energy higgs fields",
    ", this means that the contribution from the higgs loops should vanish if @xmath62 .",
    "this is satisfied in our model because the above limit is equivalent to @xmath63 , and from eq .",
    "( [ cinpss ] ) we see that the @xmath51 term goes zero in this limit .",
    "one of the neutrinos remains massless , and the experimental result @xmath64 implies @xmath65 implies , @xmath66 further approximated results can be obtained if one of the terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 dominates over the other .",
    "the tree - level dominance scenario is the most commonly assumed @xcite , and corresponds to the case @xmath69 .",
    "one of the guiding principles of split supersymmetry is gauge unification .",
    "it is expected that above the scale @xmath70 particles interactions are governed by a gauge theory based on a single gauge group .",
    "therefore we impose the unification of the three gauge couplings at @xmath70 .",
    "the starting point is at the weak scale , @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we run the couplings @xmath74 and @xmath75 until they meet at a scale we define as @xmath70 . at that point",
    "we impose @xmath76 and run back @xmath77 to the weak scale , where we impose that the strong coupling constant satisfy the experimental constraint @xmath78 @xcite .    as a working example we take @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 , and find @xmath81 gev with @xmath82 , in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the running of the three gauge coupling constans can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gauge ] .      in the same working scenario",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ gaugino ] the higgs - higgsino - gaugino couplings @xmath31 .",
    "the top three curves correspond to @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , the third one shown for comparison .",
    "above @xmath7 the three coincide as it should be in the mssm , and below @xmath7 they separate for as much as @xmath86 in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "the lower three curves correspond to @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , and they can differ for as much as @xmath89 in this scenario . considering the high precission for the measurements of neutrino mass differences , these rge effects will have an impact as we will show next .",
    "it is clear that the larger @xmath7 the larger the rge effects on the gaugino couplings @xmath31 .",
