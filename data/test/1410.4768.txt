    "the strong confinement along the vertical direction perpendicular to the layer suggests an effectively two - dimensional description along the remaining two lateral dimensions . besides the electron - electron interactions ,",

    "quantum dots can be regarded as _ artificial atoms _ , albeit with a central potential different from the nuclear coulomb attraction .",
    "their excitation spectra are probed by electronic and optical measurements , also under the influence of additional magnetic fields , which gives rise to a landau - level structure .    with the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in systems of interacting electrons in quasi two - dimensional systems , many theoretical approaches for studying interacting electrons",

    "expressions for the coulomb matrix elements are given in @xcite .",
    "in the popular _ configuration interaction _ ( ci ) approach a diagonalization of the hamiltonian including the coulomb - interaction is done with respect to a product basis of single - particle slater determinants .",
    "convergence is generally checked by systematically enlarging the size of the basis set , for instance by increasing the value of the cut - off energy up to which all states are included for the non - interacting system @xcite .    with increasing number of basis states , the computation of all interacting matrix - elements and the final diagonalization of the hamiltonian quickly exhausts computer resources .",
    "thus a reduction of the basis set while maintaining accuracy is required for studying the excitation spectra of few body systems .",
    "if the reduction is based on underlying group - theoretical properties , an exact decomposition of the basis set into irreducible blocks is possible .",
    "a diagonalization of the smaller blocks is more easily achievable and the decomposition provides physical insight into the system .",
    "one example is the separation of the spatial part of the wavefunction from the spinor states for electrons .",
    "if we require that the product of spatial and spin - part represents electrons ( antisymmetric states ) , the basis set is decomposed into separate spin states .",

    "more than 3 electrons stop and do not exploit additional properties of the basis set , such as a decomposition into relative and ( interaction - free ) center - of - mass ( _ cm _ ) states .",
    "the separation of the basis set into a product state of relative and center - of - mass part is of particular use if the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-electron system is given as a sum of operators acting on center - of - mass and relative coordinates respectively . for electrons confined to a two - dimensional plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field",
    "this separation of the hamiltonian is possible as long as the confinement potential in the two - dimensional plane does not lead to an admixing of relative and center - of - mass coordinates @xcite . for molecular or atomic systems moving in three dimensions across uniform magnetic fields , additional couplings between relative and center - of - mass coordinates occur , i.e.  the motional stark effect @xcite .",
    "the importance of a systematic separation of relative coordinates from the center - of - mass excitation for studying correlated two - dimensional electron systems for three electrons was pointed out early by laughlin @xcite and noticed recently again for more than three electrons @xcite .",
    "laughlin s trial wave function by construction is expressed only in relative coordinates and can be interpreted and numerically handled similar to a classical plasma of interacting particles @xcite .",
    "we note that both in many - electron and nuclear physics , the interactions between the particles are exclusively functions of relative coordinates .",
    "then the same shift vector applied to any single particle coordinate does not change the hamiltonian . by the well - known noether theory of symmetry it then follows that the total momentum @xmath1 of the system is conserved . for an unusual but powerful example of a conserved quantity we refer to @xcite .",
    "relative coordinates , in contrast to the single particle coordinates , are free of the @xmath2 coordinate . in quantum mechanics ,",
