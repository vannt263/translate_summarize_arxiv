    "a knowledge of circumstellar disk evolution is crucial to understanding the planet formation process .",
    "the current paradigm predicts that optically thick accretion disks left over from star formation should dissipate as material is accreted , photoevaporated , or driven out of the system , leaving a remnant or debris disk formed by collisions between large bodies in a nascent planetary system @xcite .",
    "studies of how these circumstellar debris disks evolve in the planet - forming zone from 1 to 10 au , where the disk emission emerges in the mid- and far - infrared , have been limited by the sensitivity of the previous space - based infrared missions , iras and iso .",
    "the small number of f and a stars within their reach has undermined attempts to determine the frequency of excess emission .",
    "claims of decreasing amounts of excess emission with age @xcite or an upper limit to the age of stars with debris disks @xcite have been disputed by others who question the s / n of the excesses in question and/or the reliability of age estimates for nearby field stars @xcite .",
    "the solution to this problem is to survey for debris disks around stars in young clusters of reliable and disparate ages .",
    "the high sensitivity of the _ spitzer _ mips instrument at last puts this goal within reach for nearby young clusters .",
    "the use of m47 , a young galactic open cluster , as a calibration target during the _ spitzer _ in - orbit checkout has provided an early opportunity to perform such a survey .",
    "messier 47 ( ngc 2422 ) is a reasonably compact ( core radius 30 arcmin , @xcite ) cluster of several hundred stars @xcite at galactic latitude 3@xmath4 and distance around 450pc ( see discussion in sec [ memb ] ) .",
    "its age of @xmath5 myr @xcite , is approximately the same as that of the pleiades .",
    "stromgren photometry of m47 indicates that its metallicity is also similar to that of the pleiades and @xmath6 per clusters @xcite . despite its proximity to the galactic plane",
    ", m47 has a small measured reddening of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a region around m47 was observed with mips @xcite as a verification of the scan map parameters during the in - orbit checkout period ( ads / sa.spitzer#0007427328 ) .",
    "the sky coverage is non - uniform : the effective exposure time varies over the combined @xmath8 map , from a minimum of 100 seconds at the edges to a maximum of about 600 seconds in the central @xmath9 strip .",
    "the data were reduced using the instrument team data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "the 24@xmath0 mosaic is shown in fig .",
    ". it is oversampled by a factor of two , i.e. , the pixel size is 1.27@xmath10 .",
    "the sky coverage was not optimized for the 70@xmath0 array , and only a few ( possibly extragalactic ) sources were detected at this wavelength .",
    "thus , all our analysis has focused on the 24@xmath0 data .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using the daophot package @xcite .",
    "the signal aperture radius and inner and outer sky radii were set at 3.5 , 9 and 18 pixels ( 4.5@xmath10 , 11.5@xmath10 , and 23@xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "a 0.73 mag aperture correction was applied to the measured values after examining the trend of the signal with aperture size on well isolated stars and in synthetic images .",
    "final magnitudes were put on a scale where zero magnitude at 24@xmath0 is at 7.3 jy .",
    "a total of 1093 objects was detected with @xmath11 < 12.0 $ ] ( 0.12mjy ) and s / n@xmath12 .      for the three possible m47 members with largest @xmath2 $ ] excesses ( p1121 , p369 and p922 , sec [ lt ] ) , optical spectra were obtained for us by j. liebert in february 2004 using the blue channel of the 6.5-m multiple mirror telescope spectrograph . with the 1@xmath13 slit ,",
    "the resolution was 3.6 @xmath14 and the wavelength coverage was 3640  6790  .",
    "exposure times were 4 , 4 and 5 min for p1121 ( v=12.7 ) , p922 ( v=14.5 ) and p369 ( v=16.2 ) respectively , at airmass 1.8 .",
    "to interpret our results , we need to determine which 24@xmath1 m sources are members of the cluster .",
    "our first test for membership is the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "to construct such a diagram , we need to determine the cluster distance .",
    "a distance of 497 @xmath15 pc is indicated by four b stars with hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath16 vs. @xmath17 diagram is consistent with this distance and an age of 100 myr .",
    "estimates from stromgren photometry include : @xcite : @xmath18 pc ( 28 b - a stars ) ; @xcite : 425 pc ( 11 f stars ) ; @xcite : @xmath19 pc ( average ) and @xmath20 pc ( median ) ( 36 b - f stars ) .",
    "we adopt a distance of 450 pc and @xmath21 . because the prisinzano et al .",
    "list of cluster members is incomplete above 3.5m@xmath22 , we added 11 bright stars near the cluster turn - off , taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our photometrically selected sample of m47 members detected at 24@xmath1 m then consists of 66 objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we confirmed probable membership for 63 of these 66 stars by proper motion analysis .",
    "the ucac2 @xcite , act @xcite , acc @xcite , and tycho @xcite catalogs provided data for all the possible cluster members except p369 ( which is relatively faint ) .",
    "only p1218 is ruled out as a probable member , but p1078 has large errors in its proper motion and its status is unclear .",
    "all the remaining stars have appropriate proper motions for cluster membership : @xmath23 mas / yr , @xmath24 mas / yr .    we detected at 24@xmath0 all m47 members lying within the boundaries of our mosaic and brighter than @xmath25 mag ( spectral type @xmath26f5 , 1.5m@xmath22 ) and a few as late as @xmath26k .",
    "accurate astrometry for the cluster members is available both from @xcite , who quote errors of @xmath27 , and 2mass , with typical errors @xmath28 @xmath29 . at 24@xmath1 m , _ spitzer _ positions are accurate to @xmath26 @xmath30 , but the dominant term is an offset in the scan direction that remains fixed for a campaign .",
    "it we take this offset out , the positional agreement between cluster members and 24@xmath1 m counterparts is better than @xmath31 .",
    "the total probability of even one chance coincidence between random 24@xmath1 m source and any cluster member whose photospheric flux is above our detection limit ( 0.12mjy ) is about @xmath32 . for objects brighter than 1mjy at 24@xmath1 m ,",
    "the probability of such a coincidence is @xmath28 0.25% ( take 195 instead of 1093 ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that there are any chance identifications for the brighter sources .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows @xmath33 vs. @xmath2 $ ] for these stars .",
    "the histogram of @xmath2 $ ] colors for the majority of m47 stars can be described by a gaussian centered at @xmath2 = 0.11 $ ] mag and with fwhm 0.26 mag ( @xmath34 mag ) . at these long wavelengths , for pure photospheric emission one expects @xmath2 = 0 $ ] virtually independent of spectral type .",
    "our distribution is shifted by @xmath35 0.11 mag relative to this value ; however , the offset is within the systematic error of our photometry ( @xmath26 0.10 mag , arising from uncertainties in absolute calibration ( up to 10% ) and in the aperture correction ) , and the scatter is of the order of the random error of our photometry ( 0.03 - 0.08 mag ) .",
    "we therefore define excess stars as those lying redwards of @xmath36)_{excess } = 0.11 + 3\\sigma = 0.44 $ ] mag .",
    "the majority of m47 stars ( 55 out of 66 ) have 24@xmath0 fluxes consistent with a pure photospheric origin or at most a small excess .",
    "the remaining stars form two groups : early - type stars with 0.6 @xmath28 @xmath2 $ ] @xmath28 2.5 and three late - type stars with extreme excesses @xmath2 $ ] @xmath37 1 .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists parameters of 8 m47 hot stars with 24@xmath0 excess ( out of 33 total having @xmath38 , which is characteristic of a - b stars ) .",
    "the most extreme one  v378 pup (= hip 36981 )  is a blue straggler and emission - line star , the only star in our sample that also shows a nir excess ( dougherty & taylor 1994 ) .",
    "the incidence of substantial 24@xmath1 m excesses is large : 24% of the early - type stars have excesses @xmath37 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "all of these stars are brighter than 1mjy , so the possibility of a chance coincidence with another source is very small .",
    "it has been known since iras ( @xcite , @xcite ) that the fraction of stars with infrared excesses in the field is the highest among b and m stars .",
    "this result is consistent with the high incidence of excesses among the early - type stars in m47 . in the case of emission - line stars ,",
    "the excess is explained by free - free processes in the extended gaseous envelopes / disks @xcite .",
    "the nature of the excess in non - emission - line stars is not well established : dust condensed after mass - loss episodes , dust from interstellar cirrus , and dust from circumstellar disks may all contribute @xcite .",
    "the pleiades provide a natural comparison with m47 .",
    "we identified probable pleiades members by searching for stars within 1.5 degrees of ra 03:47:00 and dec + 24:07:00 ( 2000 ) and with proper motions within 7mas / yr of 17.9 , -43.2 mas / yr respectively in ra and dec .",
    "we used the iras fsc and psc to identify infrared excesses in these stars .",
    "our preliminary analysis of pleiades _ spitzer _ data shows that all the possible excess stars we found in this manner are surrounded by 0.@xmath395 - 1@xmath39 extended halos that contaminate the iras measurements .",
    "since the surface brightness from the cirrus between m47 stars is an order of magnitude less than in the pleiades , we doubt that such halos exist around m47 stars . in addition , at the distance of m47 such halos would be resolved by the mips 6@xmath13 beam  contrary to our observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this shows the importance of m47 as a 100 myr benchmark in disk evolution , since interpretation of pleiades fir data may be severely complicated by cirrus emission .",
    "as one moves to later spectral types , the vega phenomenon becomes very rare at wavelengths of 25@xmath1 m and shorter .",
    "for example , @xcite list 462 stars with possible excesses in the iras catalog . if we take dwarf stars later than f3 and earlier than k7 , brighter than v = 8 , and at absolute galactic latitude @xmath37 10@xmath4 ( to avoid confusion with galactic emission ) , then there are no stars with candidate excesses greater than 1.5 magnitudes at 25@xmath1 m .",
    "@xcite report a similar study , with similar results .",
    "these studies searched to the full depth of the sao star catalog , making chance associations a possibility . as a more stringent test",
    ", we took a complete sample of f and g dwarfs selected to have v magnitudes that would predict photospheric fluxes of 0.5 jy or brighter at 25@xmath1 m ( and thus likely to be measured well by iras ) .",
    "this limit was set at v = 4 for f0 to f4 , v = 4.5 for f5 to f8 , and v = 5 for f9 to g8 .",
    "for these stars , we searched the iras psc for high quality measurements , and if no detection was reported there , checked if the star was listed in the fsc .",
    "of a total of 59 stars with good iras measurements , none had an excess greater than 0.3 magnitudes in [ 12 ] - [ 25 ] .",
    "similarly , @xcite found only two f or g dwarfs in the bright star catalog ( which goes to @xmath40 6.5 ) with moderate ( @xmath26 0.5 mag ) 25@xmath1 m excesses ( hr 506 and hr 818 ) , and most recently , @xcite found one k dwarf ( hd191408 ) with excess of 0.5 mag in their 25pc volume limited survey",
    ".    therefore our discovery of three late type m47 stars with excesses @xmath2 = 1 - 4 $ ] mag ",
    "p1121 , p922 , p369  is very surprising . to clarify their nature",
    ", we obtained the optical spectra of these stars shown in fig .",
    "we used spectral standards from the nstars database to classify our spectra .",
    "p369 turned out to be a reddened ( a@xmath41 mag ) k0 iii - iv slightly metal poor star , with radial velocity @xmath42 km / s .",
    "it is also the only member candidate without a confirming proper motion measurement .",
    "thus , we believe it is a background giant . on the other hand , p922 and p1121 have radial velocities consistent with cluster membership .",
    "their spectral types are k1.5 v and f9 iv - v respectively , as expected from their positions on the cluster color - magnitude diagram .",
    "both show signs of moderate chromospheric activity in caii k and h lines ( level  k  on scale of @xcite ) , which is a bit higher than observed in 800 myr old hyades stars ( r. o. gray 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "no emission is seen in h@xmath6 but slight infilling is present in h@xmath3 for p1121 . in conclusion ,",
    "p922 and p1121 have spectral signatures of young main sequence stars consistent with being m47 members ( in addition to their proper motions and photometric characteristics ) .",
    "p922 is close to the 24@xmath1 m detection limit and its photosphere would be below that limit , so the probability of a chance coincidence of an unrelated source with some cluster member to produce a similar `` system '' is @xmath26 8% . although p922 is only slightly below the photospheric detection limit , in this calculation we have included all known cluster members within the _ spitzer _ image ( @xmath26380 ) .",
    "therefore , a chance coincidence is possible but not highly likely .",
    "p922 possesses an excess at 24@xmath0 similar to the extreme debris disk stars such as @xmath43 lep ( a2 vann , 370 myr ) .",
    "p1121 is an exceptionally interesting object .",
    "all the indicators ( photometry , spectral type , proper motion , radial velocity ) place it within the cluster . its image ( fig.[fig1 ] )",
    "is point - like with no indication of extended emission in its vicinity .",
    "it is 7mjy at 24@xmath1 m and it is above our photospheric detection limit , so the probability of any chance association of a source this bright ( 25 out of 1093 total ) with a cluster member is only @xmath260.03% .",
    "if it is bright at longer wavelengths , it might have a disk as massive as seen in @xmath3 pic !",
    "it is also possible that it is surrounded by a less - massive disk lying much closer to the star than is typical . at the age of p1121 , poynting - robertson drag should have cleared out most of a thick , primordial disk .",
    "it is more likely the disk has been renewed by planetesimal collisions .",
    "this possibility is particularly interesting given the arguments that the solar system went through a phase of disk clearing , planet building , and violent planetesimal collisons for its first few hundred myr @xcite .",
    "we find substantial infrared excesses at 24@xmath1 m in 10 stars that are members of the 100 myr old cluster m47 .",
    "the most interesting example is p1121 , which is of spectral type f9 iv - v , yet has @xmath44 $ ] @xmath26 3.7 .",
    "if this excess is due to a debris disk , it likely has a large mass and is a very rare object judging from iras and iso observations of the debris - disk phenomenon .",
    "we are grateful to jim liebert and curtis williams for obtaining spectra of the ir - excess stars , richard gray and chris corbally for help with spectral classification , and eric mamajek for useful discussions .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer observatory , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
