    "just a couple of years after the introduction of the concept of ( non - abelian ) gauge fields , in his classical paper utiyama @xcite already intended to interpret general relativity as a gauge theory , in which the lorentz group emerges as the gauge group of transformations taking locally defined orthonormal bases to orthonormal ones .",
    "then mller @xcite formulated general relativity as a dynamical theory of frame fields , and in this new form einstein s theory showed indeed remarkable resemblance to yang  mills theories .",
    "this similarity of the two theories made it possible to import techniques developed in one field to the other ( see e.g. @xcite ) , yielded a deeper understanding of both ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or motivated the search for a proper gauge theoretic foundation of general relativity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the concept of charge density of non - abelian gauge fields appeared to be similar to the ( ill - defined ) concept of the energy - momentum density of the gravitational field : the vanishing of the gauge - covariant divergence of the ( gauge - covariant ) non - abelian charge 4-current ( e.g. of the fermionic matter ) in itself does _ not _ yield any gauge - covariant notion of conserved charges .    to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "tod @xcite introduced the notion of quasi - local charges in non - abelian yang ",
    "mills theories , following the analogous twistorial definition of quasi - local energy - momentum and angular momentum of penrose in general relativity .",
    "his construction is based on the use of the holomorphic _ and _ anti - holomorphic cross sections of a hermitian vector bundle .",
    "hence the original construction could give a well defined notion of charge in theories _ with ( pseudo-)unitary gauge groups _ ( or subgroups of them ) .",
    "however , the lorentz group is not such a group , thus , to be able to see the closest analogy between general relativity and proper non - abelian gauge theories as it could be possible , it would have to be considered the latter with the lorentz ( or its covering group , the @xmath0 ) gauge group .",
    "therefore , we need to generalize the notion of charge of tod to arbitrary gauge groups , or at least to the groups above .    in general relativity the energy - momentum and ( relativistic )",
    "angular momentum take the form of 2-surface integrals , like the charge in maxwell theory . however , in einstein s theory there are ten additional quantities ( and in the coupled einstein  maxwell system 16 quantities ) , taking the form of 2-surface integrals on spherical cuts of future null infinity , which are _ absolutely conserved_. these are the newman ",
    "penrose ( or np ) quantities @xcite . though their meaning is still not quite well understood , in the linear approximation they appear to characterize the radiation profile of the _ incoming radiation _ ,",
    "while in stationary configurations they are connected with the multipole structure of the source .",
    "thus the analogy between einstein s theory and the non - abelian gauge theories raises the question if the np quantities can be introduced in yang ",
    "mills theories , and whether or not they are conserved . though there is an argumentation that the analogous np quantities can not be conserved @xcite ,",
    "as far as we are aware no such mathematical analysis of the question has been given .",
    "although the charges and the np type quantities are conceptually different physical quantities , technically they are similar . thus it seems natural to consider both .",
    "therefore , the aim of the present paper is twofold : first , to generalize tod s definition of quasi - local charges to arbitrary gauge group and investigate the resulting expression in the standard small sphere and large sphere limits .",
    "the second is to form the analog of the np quantities and clarify the conditions of their conservation .    mostly to fix the notation , in section 2 , we review the theoretical background and recall some basic facts that we use .",
    "then , in section 3 , we introduce the general notion of the self - dual / anti - self - dual charge integrals .",
    "we will see that the notion of electric and magnetic charges can be formulated and studied in terms of these more naturally and easier than the original charge integrals of the field strength . in subsection 3.2",
    "we summarize the key points of tod s construction for hermitian vector bundles , and its generalization for arbitrary vector bundles and connections is suggested in subsection 3.3 , using _ either _ anti - holomorphic or holomorphic cross sections of the vector bundle .",
    "here it is also shown that for globally trivializable bundles the modified construction also gives vanishing magnetic charges .    in subsection 3.4 .",
    "the limit of the quasi - local charge integrals are calculated in three limits .",
    "first , the charges are associated with small spheres near a point .",
    "we show that _ in the first two non - trivial orders the electric charge integral is independent of the actual construction _ , i.e. has some universal nature .",
    "the solution of the field equations near a point with the necessary accuracy is given in appendix [ sub - a.1 ] .",
    "then we calculate the spatial infinity limit .",
    "we show that under the standard boundary conditions for the gauge fields this limit is finite and constant in time , i.e. these define _ conserved _ total charges . in the case of the vanishing total magnetic charges the total electric charges in the holomorphic and in the anti - holomorphic constructions coincide .",
    "we also calculate the null infinity limit of the general charge integrals .",
    "we show that there is _ no _ reasonable definition for the total charges at _ null infinity _ that , for semisimple gauge groups , could be conserved in general radiative configurations . there can be charge conservation only in special ( e.g. not radiative ) field configurations or for gauge groups whose lie algebra contains a non - trivial solvable ideal , provided the charges are introduced in the anti - holomorphic construction .",
    "the holomorphic construction appears naturally at _ past _ null infinity .",
    "section 4 .",
    "is devoted to the newman ",
    "penrose type quantities .",
    "first we show that for semisimple gauge groups _ no _ reasonable definition yields conserved np type quantities in the generic , radiative configurations , and their conservation can be expected only in special configurations or for special gauge groups . we also calculate them in special stationary field configurations and find that they are built from the expansion coefficients of the field strength with dipole and higher moments . to be able to do these calculations we had to increase the accuracy of the asymptotic solutions of the yang  mills equations of newman @xcite by two orders .",
    "these solutions are given in appendix [ sub - a.2 ] .",
    "the signature of the spacetime metric is @xmath1 , and in connection with the spin weighted spherical harmonics we use the conventions of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a real or complex vector bundle over the spacetime manifold @xmath3 with an @xmath4 dimensional real or complex vector space @xmath5 as the typical fiber , let @xmath6 , @xmath7 , be a locally defined frame field on some open @xmath8 , i.e. at each point @xmath9 the vectors @xmath10 , ... , @xmath11 span the fibre @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",

    "the dual frame field will be denoted by @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 and @xmath17 hold .",
    "clearly , such a frame field is not unique , and we allow the vector basis to be transformed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a function on @xmath20 taking its values in some subgroup @xmath21 of @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this yields the transformation @xmath24 of the dual frame field on @xmath20 , where @xmath25 .",
    "thus we think of the set of the frames above as a principal fibre bundle @xmath26 with structure group @xmath21 , and the matrices @xmath27 provide the free action of @xmath21 on @xmath28 .",
    "let a connection @xmath29 be given on @xmath2 .",
    "this can be specified by its action on the vectors @xmath30 of the frame field , yielding the connection 1-form @xmath31 on @xmath20 .",
    "the connection is a @xmath21connection if @xmath32 , as a locally defined matrix valued 1-form , takes its values in the lie algebra @xmath33 of the lie group @xmath21 .",
    "the curvature ( or field strength ) , also in the local frame field on @xmath20 , is the @xmath33 valued 2-form @xmath34 , which satisfies the bianchi identity @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is already gauge - covariant , and globally well defined .",
    "mills equations with gauge group @xmath21 and gauge - covariant source current @xmath37 are    @xmath38    these equations imply , in particular , that the spacetime _ and _ gauge - covariant divergence of @xmath39 is vanishing , and hence its spacetime divergence in itself is not : @xmath40 . therefore , by taking the flux integral on some spacelike hypersurface @xmath41 , it is the @xmath42-divergence free and _ not _ gauge - covariant current @xmath43 that should be used to define charge .",
    "thus it is more convenient to use the non - gauge - covariant form    @xmath44    of the field equations .",
    "in the rest of the paper we frequently use the matrix notation instead of writing out the boldface ( matrix lie algebra ) or abstract fiber indices explicitly .",
    "for example , equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) takes the form @xmath45)=-4 \\pi j_a$ ] .",
    "if we fix a basis @xmath46 in the lie algebra @xmath47 , @xmath48 , then we can write @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we define the structure constant @xmath51 of @xmath33 in this basis in the usual way by @xmath52 .",
    "then the definitions yield @xmath53 , and that the gauge - covariant derivative of any field e.g. with components @xmath54 can also be written in the form @xmath55 .",
    "the expression between the parentheses is just the gauge - covariant derivative on the vector bundle defined via the adjoint representation of @xmath21 as an abstract lie group , i.e. in which the typical fiber is @xmath33 as its abstract lie algebra .",

    "our aim is to modify tod s construction in such a way that ( 1 ) the gauge group can be arbitrary , ( 2 ) the number of the electric and the magnetic charges ( at least in the generic case ) be just @xmath111 , and ( 3 ) the charges be real for real bundles and connections ; but at the same time keeping the advantageous properties of the original construction ( especially the vanishing of the magnetic charges for globally trivializable bundles ) .    in principle",
    "there are several ways to ensure the correct number of charges .",
    "the first is to consider those cross sections whose components @xmath135 and @xmath136 in a _ local _ frame field @xmath6 ( as real or complex @xmath137 matrix valued functions on the domain of the frame field ) take their values in the matrix lie algebra @xmath33 . in this case",

    ". then it would be the ( all together @xmath142 ) functions @xmath140 and @xmath143 that would have to be restricted appropriately to depend only on @xmath142 parameters in the generic case . though conceptually this appears to be the most natural approach , it turns out that this framework is less flexible as it is more difficult to prove statements ( e.g. the vanishing of the magnetic charges for globally trivializable bundles ) than e.g. in the third one below .",
    "another strategy is to build the charge integrals from the curvature and the fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 _ in the adjoint representation _ ,",
    "i.e. when the typical fiber @xmath5 of the bundle @xmath2 is @xmath33 as an abstract lie algebra , and it is the structure constants that provide the matrix representation of a basis of @xmath33",
    ". however , the kernel of the action of the lie algebra on itself via the adjoint map is not trivial , it is the center of the lie algebra .",
    "thus this construction may work e.g. for semisimple lie algebras , but it would not yield any charge e.g. for abelian lie algebras .",
    "the third possibility is to construct the charge integrals in a vector bundle based on a representation in which the dimension @xmath4 of the fiber space is just @xmath111 ( though the representation is _ not a priori _ the adjoint one ) . since typically the dimension of the classical lie algebras grows with the _ square _ of the dimension of their defining representation , the representation space with the dimension of the lie algebra appears to provide enough room for a faithful representation . restricting the original construction of tod in this way we get the correct number of charges . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we follow this strategy , but , instead of @xmath144 and @xmath75 , we formulate our conditions in terms of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we search for @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the form @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , where @xmath120 and @xmath149 are anti - holomorphic while @xmath150 and @xmath151 are holomorphic .",
    "if the bundle and the connection are real , then @xmath120 and @xmath149 are anti - holomorphic cross sections of the _ complexified _ vector bundles @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively , and the tilde denotes complex conjugation . in terms of their locally defined components these conditions are    @xmath154    then clearly @xmath155 is anti - holomorphic and @xmath156 is holomorphic .    next let us calculate the integrand of @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath157 , by forming total derivatives and using ( [ eq:3.4.a ] ) and ( [ eq:3.4.b ] ) , the integrand of @xmath158 $ ] is    @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and , for the sake of brevity , we used the matrix notation . for general anti - holomorphic @xmath145 and holomorphic @xmath146 we could not prove more .",
    "if , however , we use the special form of @xmath162 and @xmath146 given in terms of @xmath120 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 and using ( [ eq:3.4.a ] ) and ( [ eq:3.4.b ] ) again , we obtain    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is the intrinsic levi - civita derivative operator on @xmath63 .",
    "thus if @xmath102 is globally trivializable and hence the connection 1-form @xmath32 can be chosen to be globally defined on @xmath63 , then the right hand side of ( [ eq:3.5 ] ) is also globally defined , yielding identically vanishing magnetic charges .",

    "we saw in subsection [ sub-3.4.3 ] that the constants @xmath310 represent the total charges .",

    "the definition of the charge matrix @xmath438 holds , i.e. @xmath439 is always an eigenvalue with eigenvector @xmath310 .",

    "however , since @xmath333 is a finite matrix , it may have only finitely many eigenvalues , and hence only finitely many coefficients @xmath432 can be non - zero . nevertheless , since the total ( electric ) charges @xmath310 can be specified freely , in general no eigenvalues of @xmath333 has the form @xmath445 for some @xmath339 .",
    "therefore , apart from the exceptional cases in which the charges have this structure , the expansion coefficient functions @xmath303 and @xmath446 are combinations only of the spherical harmonics @xmath447 and @xmath448 , respectively .",
    "thus the general solution of the homogeneous equation contains non - trivial @xmath452 for @xmath454 only if the matrix @xmath455 is chosen to be very special .",

    "thus , to summarize , in the present special stationary case the asymptotic field equations can be integrated completely and these solutions ( with the second order accuracy , i.e. keeping only @xmath459 , @xmath460 and @xmath291 ) can be indexed by the freely specifiable total ( electric ) charges @xmath310 and the expansion coefficients @xmath440 and @xmath461 ( and , in the complex case , by @xmath462 and @xmath463 , too ) .",
    "other parameters may occur in the solutions ( viz .",

    "we obtain that      moreover , if @xmath333 has an eigenvalue @xmath474 for some @xmath475 then @xmath476 are its eigenvectors while @xmath477 for all @xmath478 ; otherwise the coefficients @xmath452 are vanishing for all @xmath479 .",

    "similarly , @xmath480 is determined only up to the general solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath481 .    if the only eigenvector of @xmath333 with zero eigenvalue is the charge vector @xmath310 , then @xmath441 and @xmath482 , which imply that @xmath483 .",
    "( for the sake of simplicity we assume that the structure constants are real . )",
    "hence @xmath350 is either an arbitrary combination of the eigenvectors of @xmath333 with eigenvalue @xmath349 or zero , while @xmath480 is a solution of @xmath481 .",

    "thus the configurations for @xmath503 are always generic .    from the point of view of general relativity",
    "the most interesting choice for @xmath33 is the abstract lorentz lie algebra @xmath358 .",
    "we choose its basis @xmath504 to be the standard one , i.e. in which @xmath493 is the basis above for @xmath355 while @xmath505 , @xmath506 and @xmath507 are the ` boost generators ' such that @xmath508=0 $ ] , @xmath509=e_6 $ ] , ... etc . in this basis",
