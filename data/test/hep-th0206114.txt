    "the macroscopically observable vacuum energy shift , associated with a quantum field , is the regularised difference between the vacuum expectation value of the corresponding hamiltonian with and without the external conditions demanded by the particular physical situation at hand . at the one - loop level , when the external conditions are represented by boundary conditions ,",
    "this leads to the usual casimir effect @xcite  see ref .",
    "@xcite for an updated review on the theoretical and experimental aspects of this remarkable phenomenon .",
    "the physical fact that only bound states of quarks are experimentally observed , led to the model - dependent idea of the total confinement of the quark fields , through the so - called bag model . in general , the bag is modeled by the interior of a spherical shell within which the quarks and gluon fields are confined .",
    "there are several important calculations concerning the vacuum energy associated with the spherical bag model @xcite , as well as results concerning the influence of different boundary conditions imposed on the confined fermionic and gluonic fields @xcite .",
    "planar bag models with standard mit boundary conditions ( no fermionic currents through the surface of the bag ) have been also considered in the literature , in particular , the case of a massless fermionic field was considered in ref . @xcite and its extension to @xmath0 dimensional",
    "was discussed in ref .",
    "the massive case in three spatial dimensions was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the context of the evaluation of the zero point energies associated with confined quantum fields , some configurations ,",
    "which depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold and its dimensionality , and the specific boundary condition imposed on the quantum field on certain surfaces , lead to relatively simple spectra , easy to deal with , but others lead to rather complex ones .",
    "the heart of the matter in these calculations is the ( physically meaningful ) evaluation of the spectral sum that results at the one - loop level from the definition of the casimir energy .",
    "this evaluation requires regularization and renormalization , and recipes for accomplishing this task range from the relatively simple cutoff method , employed by casimir himself @xcite , to a number of powerful and elegant generalised zeta function techniques @xcite .",
    "contour integral representations of spectral sums are a great improvement in the techniques of evaluating zero - point energies ; they are especially useful when the spectra are not simple , and have been employed profusely before @xcite .    here , our aim is twofold .",
    "first , with the same objectives as in refs . @xcite in mind , we want to generalise to @xmath5 dimensions a simple and effective way of evaluating the one - loop vacuum energy under external conditions , based on well - known theorems of complex analysis , namely , the cauchy integral formula and the mittag - leffler expansion theorem in one of its simplest versions @xcite .",
    "the method we will present , although very simple , is of sufficient generality so as to be successfully applied to a variety of cases .",
    "second , we want to apply our basic formula to the case of the @xmath5 dimensional slab - bag , in which the quark field is constrained into a region bounded by two infinite hyperslabs separated by a fixed distance @xmath6 .",
    "mit boundary conditions ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) will be imposed on the quantum field .",
    "there are no fermionic field oscillations outside the interior region of the slab - bag , a situation that must be compared with the one in which the boundary conditions split the spacetime in several regions , and the zero - point oscillations of the relevant quantum fields are present in all of them .",
    "this example is one of the simplest one can think of that leads already to a relatively complex spectrum , and serves as a convenient test of the calculational tool that we present here .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the method , and get the basic formula . in sect .",
    "3 , we apply our main result to the problem in hand , and obtain its exact solution in terms of whittaker functions . finally , we consider some particular limits and check coincidence with some other results .",
    "the last section is devoted to final remarks .",
    "we employ natural units ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "consider a quantum field living in a @xmath0 dimensional ultrastatic flat spacetime under boundary conditions imposed on two hyperplanes of area @xmath8 kept a distance @xmath6 apart .",
    "hence the motion along one of the spatial directions , say , the @xmath9-axis , is restricted .",
    "suppose that the condition @xmath10 holds .",
    "at the one loop - level , the ( unregularised ) casimir energy is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a dimensionless factor that counts the number of internal degrees of freedom of the quantum field under consideration , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-th real root of the transcendental equation determined by the boundary conditions , @xmath6 is a chararacteristic length along the @xmath9 direction , and @xmath17 is the mass of an excitation of the quantum field .",
    "a simple integral representation of @xmath18 can be written if we make use of cauchy s integral formula .",
    "in fact , it is easily seen that @xmath19 where in principle @xmath20 is restricted to be a jordan curve on the @xmath21-complex plane with @xmath22 , consisting of a semicircle of infinitely large radius , whose diameter is the entire real axis . taking ( [ cauchy ] ) into ( [ unregenergy ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath23 in order to proceed we must be able to perform ( in a physically meaningful way , as mentioned above ) the discrete sum in ( [ unregenergy2 ] ) .    consider a complex function @xmath24 of a single complex variable z , symmetrical on the real axis and such that its roots are simple , non - zero and symmetrical with respect to the origin of the complex plane .",
    "the assumption that the origin is not a root of @xmath24 is not a restrictive one , because if @xmath25 happens to be a root of @xmath24 , we can always divide @xmath24 by some convenient power of @xmath26 in order to eliminate zero from the set of roots , without introducing any new singularity .",
    "let us order and count the roots of @xmath24 in such a way that @xmath27 now define the following meromorphic function @xmath28 where the prime indicates that the term corresponding to @xmath29 must be omitted from the sum .",
    "the following properties of @xmath30 are straightforward : ( i ) @xmath30 has first order poles which are determined by the roots of @xmath31 : ( ii ) the corresponding residua are all equal to one .",
    "taking into account property ( [ symmetry ] ) , we see that @xmath30 can be rewritten as @xmath32 let us consider now the function @xmath33 .",
    "we can state that @xmath34 where the prime stands for ` derivative with respect to @xmath26 ' .",
    "in fact , the function @xmath35 has the same simple poles as the originally defined @xmath30 , and also the same residuum at each pole .",
    "hence , we can invoke the mittag - leffler theorem , to conclude that eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) is true up to an entire function which does not contribute to the evaluation of the vacuum energy .",
    "it then follows that we can write @xmath36 = \\sum _ { n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{2z}{z^{2}+\\lambda _ { n}^{2}}.\\ ] ]    in order to make use of eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) , we first link the dimensionless complex variable @xmath26 to the auxiliary complex momentum variable @xmath21 , through the relation @xmath37 hence @xmath38 and @xmath39 notice that @xmath40 is explicitly omitted on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ sumsum ] ) .",
    "changing variables ( @xmath41 ) , we obtain for the unregularised casimir energy the following expression @xmath42 , \\ ] ] which can be integrated by parts to yield @xmath43 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\label{unregenergy3 } \\\\ & & +   \\alpha \\left ( d\\right ) \\ , \\frac{l^{d-1}}{2}\\int \\frac{d^{d-1}p_{\\bot } } { ( 2\\pi ) ^{d-1}}\\int _ { \\gamma } \\frac{dq}{2\\pi } \\log \\left [ k(z)\\right ] .\\label{eintegral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the integration is now performed on an open curve which lies on the riemann surface of the integrand the projection of which on the @xmath21-complex plane is the curve @xmath20 .",
    "this curve begins at a point in the second quadrant very close to the imaginary axis and very far from the origin , describes an arc of a circle counterclockwise until it meets the real axis , then proceeds to the right along the real axis towards a point very far from the origin , where it starts to describe another arc of circle counterclockwise until it meets again the imaginary axis ( fig .",
    "the first term on the rhs of ( [ eintegral ] ) contributes with a phase which cancels out with a phase coming from the second term , being the final result real .",
    "the second term still needs regularization and in order to accomplish this we split the function @xmath44 in two parts@xmath45 with the following properties : ( i ) all terms whose integrals diverge when @xmath46 are in @xmath47 and ( ii ) all terms whose integrals diverge when @xmath48 are in @xmath49 , ( iii ) the symmetry@xmath50 holds .",
    "then , we can write@xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\int _ { \\gamma _ { 1}}\\frac{dq}{2\\pi } \\log \\left [ k_{1}\\left ( z\\right ) \\right ] + \\int",

    "the integrals over @xmath54 , are evaluated along the different parts , @xmath55 , of the curve @xmath20 and , owing to the symmetry of the construction , their sum is equal to the integral of @xmath56 along the total path @xmath57 ; this yields a phase that , as remarked above , cancels the phase coming from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eintegral ] ) .",
    "the other two integrals are reduced to their contribution along the real axis , and we can write @xmath58 , \\ ] ] where all along the real axis @xmath26 does not change its sign and is a function of @xmath59 and @xmath17 given by @xmath60 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ unregenergy4 ] ) gives the _ regularised _ confined vacuum energy .",
    "we can proceed a little bit further , still without specialising eq .",
    "( [ unregenergy4 ] ) .",
    "first we make use of @xmath61 and rescale the integration variable according to @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 , \\ ] ] where now @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "let us change the integration variable , according to @xmath66 .",
    "then it follows that the regularised vacuum energy is given by @xmath67 .\\ ] ] equation ( [ mainresult ] )  or if one wishes eq .",
    "( [ unregenergy4 ] )  is our main result .",
    "it is not hard to realize that this result holds for arbitrary boundary conditions imposed on the field on flat surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath68 axis .",
    "however , due to the subtraction of the zero root from the set of all roots , an extra multiplicative factor of 2 will be needed when dealing with topological periodic or antiperiodic conditions .",
    "the function @xmath69 can be constructed from the boundary conditions , as we will see explicitly in the next section .",
    "as an example of the usefulness of ( [ unregenergy4 ] ) , let us apply it to a massive fermion field confined within an hypothetical hyperbag with mit boundary conditions imposed on the field , on the @xmath9 axis .",
    "it can be shown that , for this relatively simple bag model , the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are determined by the roots of the function @xmath71 , defined by @xcite@xmath72 therefore we can choose @xmath73 as @xmath74 where we have divided @xmath75 by @xmath76 because @xmath77 is a root of @xmath78 .",
    "we can easily prove that for the case at hand the roots of @xmath73 are all real .",
    "now , we construct @xmath79 in accordance with @xmath80 it follows that we can write @xmath81 and@xmath82 notice that the symmetry given by eq .",
    "( [ symmetry2 ] ) is obeyed as it should . for a fermionic quantum field in @xmath0 dimensions , we have @xmath83 , where the factor @xmath84 takes into account the existence of particle and antiparticle states , while @xmath85 counts the number of different spin states and is given by @xmath86 , for @xmath87 odd , and by @xmath88 , for d even .",
    "therefore the regularised vacuum energy of the fermion field is @xmath89 .\\ ] ] setting @xmath90 we readily obtain the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite . equation ( [ mitdenergy ] ) can be integrate by the following procedure .",
    "first we make use of@xmath91 which holds for @xmath92 , and write eq .",

    ", we must evaluate eq .",
    "( [ mitenergy ] ) numerically ( which can be done very quickly ) or consider some special limits .",
    "the limit @xmath107 is determined by the behavior of the whittaker function on the positive real axis for small values of the argument . for completeness , we state some facts concerning this function and relevant to our purposes in the appendix .",
    "it follows then that , for @xmath107 , the casimir energy is given by @xmath108 setting @xmath90 we obtain the well known result due to johnson @xcite , namely@xmath109 equation ( [ smallze ] ) is also in agreement with the analysis of de paola , rodrigues and svaiter for the @xmath0 dimensional slab - bag for massless fermions @xcite .",
    "this can be easily verified by setting @xmath110 and making use of the duplication formula for the gamma function @xcite@xmath111 with @xmath112 . for @xmath90 , in order to compare our result with one obtained by @xcite in this limit we take into account the second term of the small @xmath26 approximation of the whittaker function ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the result is then @xmath113 where @xmath114 which is approximately half of the value obtained in @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have derived a general regularised expression , eq .",
    "( [ unregenergy4 ] ) , for the evaluation of the casimir energy of a quantum field in a flat manifold under the influence of boundary conditions , imposed on the field on flat surfaces , or topological conditions constraining the motion along a particular spatial direction .",
    "then we have applied the main result to the case of a massive fermionic quantum field confined by a planar @xmath5 dimensional slab - bag with mit boundary conditions . an exact result for the confined fermionic vacuum energy",
    "was obtained in terms of the derivative of the whittaker function with respect to a dimensionless parameter .",
    "approximate expressions for the vacuum energy were obtained in the limits of small and large values of the parameter @xmath119 .",
    "the authors have verified explicitly that the simple eq . ( [ unregenergy4 ] ) works perfectly well in several other instances .",
    "for example , it also holds when the @xmath9 direction is compactified by the imposition of topological conditions , periodic or antiperiodic , on the quantum field along that direction .",
