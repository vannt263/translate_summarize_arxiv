    "the electrons that carry charge current in electronic circuits also have spins . in non - ferromagnetic samples ,",
    "the spins are usually randomly oriented and do not play a role in the behavior of the device . however ,",
    "when ferromagnetic components are incorporated into a device , the flowing electrons can become partially spin polarized and these spins can play an important role in device function . due to spin - based interactions between the ferromagnets and electrons , the orientations of the magnetization for",
    "ferromagnetic elements can determine the amount of current flow . by means of these same interactions , the electron spins can also influence the orientations of the magnetizations .",
    "this last effect , the so - called spin transfer torque , is the topic of the following series of articles .",
    "the goal of these articles is to provide an introduction to the topical scientific issues concerning the theories , experiments , and commercial applications related to spin transfer torques .",
    "these articles are written by some of the leaders in the study of spin transfer torques and we hope that they will be useful to beginning students starting their study as well as of interest to experts in the field .",
    "the authors of the succeeding articles were asked to consider the field from their particular point of view , and to provide a `` preview ''  including discussion of interesting unsolved problems  rather than merely a review of completed work .",
    "hopefully , when taken together these articles provide a broad and representative view of where the field is and where it may be going .    the goal of the present article is to provide basic background and context for the succeeding articles .",
    "we start with a very brief history of the field and provide references to background material .",
    "then , in section [ sec : ferro ] , we introduce aspects of ferromagnetism that are important to the discussion , particularly for transition - metal ferromagnets , and discuss how spin polarized currents arise .",
    "section [ sec : stt ] describes how spin transfer torques can be understood as resulting from changes in spin currents .",
    "section [ sec : multi ] explains some of the issues associated with how spin transfer torques affect magnetic - multilayer devices and tunnel junctions .",
    "section [ sec : wires ] describes how they affect domain walls in magnetic nanowires .",
    "finally , section [ sec : outlook ] introduces the succeeding articles in the context provided by the rest of this article .",
    "the first work to consider the existence of spin transfer torques occurred in the late 1970 s and 1980 s , with berger s prediction that spin transfer torques should be able to move magnetic domain walls @xcite , followed by his group s experimental observations of domain - wall motion in thin ferromagnetic films under the influence of large current pulses @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon did not attract a great deal of attention at the time , largely because very large currents ( up to 45 a ! ) were required , given that the samples were quite wide  on the scale of mm .",
    "however , with advances in nanofabrication techniques , magnetic wires with 100 nm widths can now be made readily , and these exhibit domain wall motion at currents of a few ma and below .",
    "research on spin - transfer - induced domain wall motion has been pursued vigorously by many groups since the early days of the 21st century @xcite .",
    "the present state of studies of spin - torque - driven domain wall motion is described in the articles by beach , tsoi , and erskine , by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer , and by ohno and dietl .",
    "widespread interest in magnetic nanostructures began in 1986 with the discovery of interlayer exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "interlayer exchange coupling @xcite is the interaction between the magnetizations of two ferromagnetic layer separated by an ultrathin , non - ferromagnetic spacer layer .",
    "of particular interest was the discovery of antiferromagnetic coupling in the fe / cr / fe system by grnberg et al . because it led shortly thereafter to the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect by grnberg s group and fert s group @xcite .",
    "grnberg and fert shared the 2007 nobel prize in physics for this discovery .",
    "gmr is the change in resistance that occurs when the relative orientation of the magnetizations in two ferromagnetic layers changes .",
    "for example , when the magnetizations of two fe layers separated by cr are antiparallel to each other as they are when antiferromagnetically coupled , the sample has a relatively large resistance .",
    "the magnetizations of the fe layers can be brought into parallel alignment by an external magnetic field , and this decreases the resistance . at intermediate angles , the resistance is also intermediate between these maximum and minimum values .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : gmr ] . the overall size of the change in resistance is typically up to a few 10 s of percent , which is `` giant '' compared to the @xmath0 1  % magnetoresistance changes of pure magnetic metals by themselves ( due to anisotropic magnetoresistance @xcite ) .",
    "most of the early work on gmr focused on the sample geometry in which the current flows in the plane ( cip ) of the multilayer sample .",
    "another geometry , first explored in 1991 @xcite has the current flow perpendicular to the planes ( cpp ) of the multilayer and gives larger fractional resistance changes @xcite .",
    "the cpp geometry is of particular interest in the present context because spin transfer effects are more important than they are in the cip geometry .    in studying the gmr effect ,",
    "et al_.  discovered in 1990 that the interlayer exchange coupling oscillates as a function of the thickness of the spacer layer @xcite .",
    "the oscillations could be quite dramatic ; up to sixty changes in sign of the coupling were seen in single wedge - shaped samples allowing the simultaneous study of a range of thicknesses @xcite .",
    "comparison of the oscillations with calculations @xcite confirmed that this coupling was an exchange interaction mediated by the electrons in the spacer layer and that the oscillation periods were determined by the geometry of the spacer layer s fermi surface .    in 1989 , slonczewski @xcite calculated the interlayer exchange coupling for the case in which the spacer layer is an insulating tunnel barrier .",
    "while there were no measurements of exchange coupling across insulators at the time , his article has two features of particular interest in regard to spin - torque physics .",
    "first , slonczewski calculated the exchange coupling by determining the spin current flowing through the tunnel barrier .",
    "a spin current flows even with zero applied bias across the tunnel junction whenever the magnetizations of the two electrodes are non - collinear , and the source of the exchange coupling can be understood to be the transfer of angular momentum from this spin current to each magnet .",
    "the second feature of interest is that he considered the additional coupling that results when a voltage is applied across the junction .",
    "this was the first calculation of a spin transfer torque in a multilayer geometry with current flowing perpendicular to the plane . however , there was little immediate experimental follow - up , because the technology for making magnetic tunnel junctions at that time was still rather primitive , and provided only tunnel barriers that were too thick to permit the large current densities needed to excite spin - torque - driven magnetic dynamics .    the papers most influential in launching the study of spin transfer torques came in 1996 , when slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite independently predicted that current flowing perpendicular to the plane in a metallic multilayer can generate a spin transfer torque strong enough to reorient the magnetization in one of the layers .",
    "since the metallic magnetic multilayers used for gmr studies have low resistances ( compared to tunnel barriers ) , they could easily sustain the current densities required for spin transfer torques to be important .",
    "slonczewski predicted that the spin transfer torque from a direct current could excite two qualitatively different types of magnetic behaviors depending on the device design and the magnitude of an applied magnetic field : either simple switching from one static magnetic orientation to another or a dynamical state in which the magnetization undergoes steady - state precession .",
    "his subsequent 1997 patent @xcite was remarkably far - seeing , providing detailed predictions for many of the applications that are currently being pursued .",
    "measurements of current - induced resistance changes in magnetic multilayer devices were first identified with spin - torque - driven excitations in 1998 by tsoi _",
    "et al_. , for devices consisting of a mechanical point contact to a metallic multilayer @xcite , and in 1999 by sun in manganite devices @xcite .",
    "observation of magnetization reversal caused by spin torques in lithographically defined samples occurred shortly thereafter @xcite .",
    "[ fig : switching ] shows comparisons between spin - torque - driven magnetic switching and magnetic - field driven switching for a metallic multilayer and a magnetic tunnel junction .",
    "phase - locking between spin - torque - driven magnetic precession and an alternating magnetic field was detected in 2000 @xcite and direct measurements of steady - state high - frequency magnetic precession caused by spin torque from a direct current were made beginning in 2003 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : oscil ] shows an example of voltage oscillations due to spin - torque - driven magnetic precession .",
    "the article by berkov and miltat describes some of these results and shows to what extent it is currently possible to make a detailed comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "the article by silva and rippard discusses some of the open questions pertaining to spin - torque - driven precession in the point - contact sample geometry .    at the same time that interest was beginning to grow regarding spin transfer torques in metallic multilayers , so was the interest in magnetic tunnel junctions , starting with the observation in 1995 of substantial tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr , the difference in resistance between parallel and antiparallel orientation for the electrode magnetizations of a magnetic tunnel junction ) at room temperature @xcite .",
    "most of the early studies used aluminum oxide as a tunnel barrier . since",
    "aluminum oxide barriers are heavily disordered it is difficult to study them theoretically . in 2001 ,",
    "et al_.  and mathon and umerski calculated the tunneling properties of the fe / mgo / fe system @xcite , which can be lattice - matched and potentially well - ordered .",
    "they found that the symmetry of the system and the relevant electronic states lead to the possibility of an extremely large tmr . in 2004 , values of tmr greater than those observed for aluminum oxide barriers were published @xcite and the values of tmr demonstrated experimentally have continued to increase rapidly until this day .",
    "techniques have now been developed to make both aluminum oxide and mgo tunnel barriers sufficiently thin to support the current densities needed to produce magnetic switching with spin transfer torques @xcite .",
    "work is underway to investigate spin - torque - driven precession in tunnel barriers , as well .",
    "one reason for the interest in spin - torque effects in tunnel junctions is that tunnel junctions are better - suited than metallic magnetic multilayers for many types of applications .",
    "tunnel junctions have higher resistances that can often be better impedance - matched to silicon - based electronics , and tmr values can now be made larger than the gmr values in metallic devices .",
    "the science and technology of spin transfer torques in tunnel junctions are discussed in the articles by katine and fullerton and by sun and ralph .",
    "the possibility of commercial application has been a strong driving force in this field from the beginning .",
    "grnberg @xcite filed a german patent for applications of gmr in 1988 even before the effect was published in the scientific literature , and the phrase `` giant magnetoresistance '' now appears in over 1500 us patents .",
    "devices based on the gmr and tmr effects have already found very widespread application as the magnetic - field sensors in the read heads of magnetic hard disk drives , and a non - volatile random access memory based on magnetic tunnel junctions has recently been introduced .",
    "slonczewski s 1997 patent @xcite for devices based on spin transfer torques has been referenced by 64 subsequent patents .",
    "applications of spin transfer torques are envisioned using both types of magnetic dynamics that spin torques can excite .",
    "magnetic switching driven by the spin transfer effect can be much more efficient than switching driven by current - induced magnetic fields ( the mechanism used in the existing magnetic random access memory ) .",
    "this may enable the production of magnetic memory devices with much lower switching currents and hence greater energy efficiency and also greater device density than field - switched devices .",
    "the steady - state magnetic precession mode that can be excited by spin transfer is under investigation for a number of high - frequency applications , for example nanometer - scale frequency - tunable microwave sources , detectors , mixers , and phase shifters .",
    "one potential area of use is for short - range chip - to - chip or even within - chip communications .",
    "spin - torque - driven domain wall motion is also under investigation for memory applications .",
    "parkin has proposed a `` racetrack memory '' @xcite which envisions storing bits of information using many domains arranged sequentially in a magnetic nanowire and retrieving the information by using spin transfer torques to move the domains through a read - out sensor .",
    "the article by katine and fullerton discusses in detail the opportunities and challenges for potential applications .",
    "there are several books that can provide more background information for this set of articles on spin transfer torques .",
    "one resource is the four volume series _ ultrathin magnetic structures _ edited by heinrich and bland @xcite .",
    "these volumes contain articles on almost all aspects of magnetic thin films and devices made out of them .",
    "another useful book , written at a more pedagogical level , is _ nanomagnetism : ultrathin films , multilayers and nanostructures _ , edited by mills and bland @xcite .",
    "the three volume series _ spin dynamics in confined magnetic structures _ edited by hillebrands , ounadjela , and thiaville covers dynamical aspects of magnetic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "the five volume set , handbook of magnetism and advanced magnetic materials , edited by kronmller and parkin , covers the entire field of magnetism including the topics of interest here @xcite .",
    "_ concepts in spin electronics",
    "_ , edited by maekawa , provides another recent overview @xcite .",
    "finally , the journal of magnetism and magnetic materials published a collection of review articles including several on topics related to magnetic multilayers in volume 200 @xcite .",
    "specific chapters in these books and other review articles on spin transfer torques will be mentioned throughout this article .",
    "_ the origin of ferromagnetism .",
    "_ ferromagnetism occurs when an electron system becomes spontaneously spin polarized . in transition metals , ferromagnetism results from a balance between atomic - like exchange interactions , which tend to align spins , and inter - atomic hybridization , which tends to reduce spin polarization .",
    "an accurate accounting of both effects is quite difficult @xcite .",
    "however , a qualitative understanding is straightforward . in isolated atoms ,",
    "hund s rules describe how to put electrons into nearly degenerate atomic levels to minimize the energy .",
    "hund s first rule says to maximize the spin , that is , to put in as many electrons with spins in one direction into a partially filled atomic orbital before you start adding spins in the other direction .",
    "the energy gain that motivates hund s rule is that pauli exclusion keeps electrons with the same spin further apart on average , thereby lowering the coulomb repulsion between them .",
    "this energy is called the atomic exchange energy . in accordance with hund",
    "s first rule , essentially all isolated atoms with partially filled orbital levels have non - zero spin moments .",
    "non - zero values of orbital angular momentum can also contribute to the magnetic moment of isolated atoms . in solids , on the other hand , electron states on neighboring atoms hybridize and form bands .",
    "band formation acts to suppress the formation of magnetic moments in two ways .",
    "first , hybridization breaks spherical symmetry for the environment of each atom , which tends to quench any orbital component of the magnetic moment .",
    "second , band formation also inhibits spin polarization .",
    "if one starts with a system of unpolarized electrons and imagines flipping spins to create alignment , then there is a kinetic - energy cost associated with moving electrons from lower - energy filled band states to higher - energy unoccupied band states . as a result , most solids are not ferromagnetic .",
    "there are , of course , exceptions .",
    "for example in materials with tightly bound 4f - orbitals , the hybridization is so weak that those levels do become spin polarized much as they do in the atomic state . the transition metal ferromagnets iron , cobalt , nickel , and their alloys , having partially filled d - orbitals , are the exceptions of particular interest in these articles .",
    "the transition metal ferromagnets have both strong exchange splitting and strong hybridization .",
    "the exchange splitting can stabilize a spin - polarized ferromagnetic state , even in the presence of band formation , by generating a self - consistent shift of the majority - electron - spin band states to lower energy than the minority - electron - spin states , so as to more than compensate for the kinetic - energy cost associated with the formation of the polarization .",
    "_ models of ferromagnetic materials . _",
    "the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite accurately describes much of the important physics in these systems .",
    "it treats the atomic - like exchange and correlation effects in mean field theory and treats the hybridization exactly . without any fitting parameters it accurately predicts @xcite many of the properties of transition metal ferromagnets like the magnetic moment . in this approach ,",
    "the electron density and spin density are the fundamental degrees of freedom and the wave functions are formal constructs that allow calculation of the density . as such",
    ", there is no formal justification for using the lsda wave functions as the physical wave functions .",
    "however , the wave functions are a solution to an accurate mean field theory ( lsda ) and in practice they can serve as a good approximation to the real wave functions in many cases",
    ". many calculations of spin transfer torques are based on using the wave functions found from the lsda ; see in particular the article from haney , duine , nez , and macdonald for examples .",
    "there are two simplified models of ferromagnetism that are sometimes used to give descriptions of the physics of spin transfer torques and for calculations .",
    "the first is the free - electron stoner model .",
    "this assumes that the electron bands for spin - up and spin - down electrons have a relative shift in energy due to an exchange interaction but otherwise they both have a free - electron dispersion , @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the pauli spin matrix and @xmath3 is the exchange splitting .",
    "the second simplified model is the s - d model .",
    "it was originally introduced @xcite to describe local moment impurities in a non - magnetic host .",
    "the `` s '' electrons describe the delocalized conduction band states of the host and the `` d '' electrons describe the localized magnetic states , which are weakly coupled to the s electrons .",
    "frequently , each d electron shell is treated as a local moment @xmath4 , which interacts with the conduction - electron spin density @xmath5 through a weak local interaction @xmath6 .",
    "neither the stoner model nor the s - d model are well - justified approximations for describing the transition - metal ferromagnets .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] for a comparison of the band structures of these two models with a more realistic band structure for co computed using the lsda .",
    "the simplified models can be very useful for illustrating physical concepts , and sometimes for estimates , but they are far from realistic .",
    "the band structure in transition - metal ferromagnets is considerably more complicated than that of a single free - electron band as assumed in the stoner model . as for comparisons to the s - d model , in real materials",
    "the hybridization within the d bands and of the d bands with the s bands are quite strong , and so the d electrons can not be considered localized .",
    "on the other hand , the s - d model is one of several models that have been used to describe ferromagnetic semiconductors , like those discussed in the article by ohno and dietl . in these systems ,",
    "the mn substitutions are believed to act very much like local moments .",
    "the origins of spin - polarized currents in magnetic devices and the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect can be understood as consequences of the difference in band structures for the majority - spin and minority - spin states in magnets , as predicted by lsda calculations and illustrated in a over - simplified way by the exchange splitting in the free - electron stoner model .",
    "spin - polarized currents can come about because the spin - dependent electron properties in ferromagnets allow magnetic thin films to act like spin filters .",
    "consider the example of cr / fe multilayers in which gmr was first discovered . for electrons incident from cr into a fe layer ,",
    "minority spins have a greater probability to be transmitted through the fe film than majority spins , due to differences scattering caused by the band - structure mismatch at the interface and also due to band - structure - induced differences in the strength of scattering from defects and impurities in the fe layer @xcite .",
    "therefore the current transmitted through the fe layer in a cr / fe / cr device is partially spin - polarized in the minority direction , while the current reflected from the layer is partially polarized in the majority direction .",
    "many other factors can also affect the ultimate polarization of the currents , including the layer thickness and the spin flip scattering rates .",
    "once in a non - ferromagnetic metal like cr or cu , a spin - polarized current persists on the scale of the spin diffusion length , typically on the order of 100 nm or more in cu and about 5 nm in cr .",
    "when two fe layers in a cr / fe multilayer are spaced more closely than this and have parallel magnetic moments , minority electrons have a high probability of being transmitted through both layers , resulting in a relatively low overall device resistance even though the majority electrons are scattered strongly . in effect , the minority electrons `` short out '' the structure , giving a low resistance .",
    "when nearby magnetic layers have antiparallel moments , both majority and minority electrons scatter strongly in either one layer or the other , and the resulting resistance is higher .",
    "this is the origin of gmr .",
    "other combinations of normal metals and magnetic layers can act similarly , although for combinations like cu / co or cu / ni it is the majority electrons that are more easily transmitted through the magnetic layer , rather than the minority electrons @xcite .",
    "a number of different theoretical approaches have been used to calculate the transport properties of magnetic multilayers and their gmr @xcite .",
    "these techniques will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : multi ] .",
    "_ micromagnetics .",
    "_ in order to describe the equilibrium configuration of the magnetization in a ferromagnet , or the dynamical response to an applied magnetic field or a spin - transfer torque , it can be important to take into account that the magnetization distribution may become spatially non - uniform .",
    "micromagnetics @xcite is a phenomenological description of magnetism on a mesoscopic length scale designed to model such non - uniformities in an efficient way . it does not attempt to describe the behavior of the moment associated with each atom , but rather adopts a continuum description much like elasticity theory .",
    "its utility arises because the length scales of interest in magnetic studies are frequently much longer than atomic lengths .",
    "atomic scale calculations become impractical in this case .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the magnetization direction aligns itself with an effective field , which can vary as a function of position .",
    "there are generally four main contributions to this effective field : the externally applied magnetic field , magnetocrystalline anisotropy , micromagnetic exchange , and the magnetostatic field .",
    "each of the fields is most easily described in terms of an associated contribution to the free energy .",
    "the total effective field is then the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetization @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy arises from the spin - orbit interactions and tends to align the magnetization with particular lattice directions . generally speaking the anisotropy field",
    "is a local function of the magnetization direction and has a different functional form for different lattices and materials .",
    "the micromagnetic exchange @xcite is the interaction that tends to keep the magnetization aligned in a common direction , adding an energy cost when the magnetization rotates as a function of position .",
    "the magnetostatic interaction is a highly non - local interaction between the magnetization at different points mediated by the magnetic field produced by the magnetization .",
    "together , the four free energies can be written @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath12 is the exchange constant , and @xmath13 is the anisotropy constant .",
    "here we have taken the specific example of a uniaxial anisotropy with an easy axis along @xmath14 . the total effective field derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mumage ] ) is @xmath15 the atomic - like exchange , which drives the formation of the magnetization and which is not explicit in these expressions , places a strong energetic penalty on deviations of the magnitude of @xmath16 away from @xmath11 .",
    "this interaction is generally taken into account by treating @xmath16 as having the fixed length @xmath11 .",
    "_ magnetic domains .",
    "_ the interactions within eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mumage ] ) and ( [ eq : mumagh ] ) can compete with one another in determining the orientation of @xmath17 as a function of position .",
    "different interactions can dominate on different spatial scales , with the consequence that the magnetic ground state is often spatially non - uniform , containing non - trivial magnetization patterns even in equilibrium .",
    "the micromagnetic exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy both represent relatively short - ranged or local interactions .",
    "the micromagnetic exchange tends to keep the magnetization spatially uniform and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can tend to keep it directed in particular lattice directions . for the energy functional above , with uniaxial anisotropy ,",
    "those directions are @xmath18 . for the materials of interest for spin transfer applications",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is frequently weak and does not play an important role ( although there are exceptions @xcite ) .",
    "anisotropies in spin transfer devices are more commonly the result of the sample shape .",
    "magnetostatic interactions favor magnetization orientations aligned in the plane of thin - film samples and along the long axis of samples with non - circular cross - sections . because of the dipole pattern of long - ranged magnetic fields , the magnetostatic interaction can also favor antiparallel alignment of the magnetization in distant parts of a sample , and this can cause the magnetization pattern to become non - uniform . on short",
    "length scales the magnetostatic interaction is relatively weak in comparison to micromagnetic exchange .",
    "however the magnetostatic interaction is long - ranged so that it can eventually dominate in large enough samples .",
    "this causes the magnetization pattern to depend on the sample size . for magnetic thin - film samples smaller than about 100  nm to 200  nm in diameter ,",
    "the ground state is approximately ( but not exactly ) uniform , with the micromagnetic exchange dominating the magnetostatic interactions @xcite . for samples slightly bigger than this ,",
    "magnetostatic interactions become more important and the ground state can be a vortex state . for still larger samples , the magnetization pattern may break up into regions which have different magnetic orientations but within which the magnetization is roughly uniform .",
    "these regions are called domains @xcite .    the border region between domains",
    "is referred to as a domain wall . here",
    "the magnetization rotates over a relatively short distance from one domain s orientation to the other s .",
    "the more gradual is this rotation , the less the cost in exchange energy .",
    "however , wider domain walls deviate from the low - energy orientation for magnetocrystalline anisotropy over a larger volume , and therefore cost more anisotropy energy .",
    "the domain wall width is determined by a compromise which minimizes the total energy of exchange + anisotropy , and can be characterized roughly by the scale @xmath19 .",
    "this length is strongly material dependent , ranging from @xmath0  1  nm for hard magnetic materials to more than 100  nm for soft magnetic materials . in cases with weak anisotropy ,",
    "domain wall widths are determined by a competition between exchange and magnetostatic interactions .",
    "the domain wall width can also depend on sample geometry , and in a narrow contact between electrodes the wall width can be narrowed in proportion to the contact diameter @xcite .    in thin - film wires ,",
    "typical of those used to study current - induced domain wall motion , domain walls typically take one of two structures , `` transverse '' walls or `` vortex '' walls . on either side of the wall ,",
    "the magnetization lies in - plane and points along the length of the wire to minimize the magnetostatic energy , and there is a net 180@xmath20 rotation of the magnetization at the wall . in a transverse wall , the magnetization simply rotates in the plane of the sample from one domain to the other .",
    "however , the competition between the micromagnetic exchange energy and the magnetostatic energy causes the wall width to be narrow ( on the scale of the exchange length , @xmath21 4  nm to 8  nm , where @xmath12 is the prefactor of the micromagnetic exchange in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mumage ] ) and @xmath11 is the saturation magnetization ) on one edge of the wire and wide ( on the scale of the width of the wire ) on the other edge .",
    "a vortex wall is even more complicated . here , the magnetization wraps around a central singularity @xcite , the vortex core , giving a circulating pattern to the magnetization .",
    "the competition between these two wall structures is studied in ref .",
    "beach , tsoi , and erskine describe how the detailed structure of domain walls plays a crucial role in their motion when they are driven by either an applied magnetic field or a spin transfer torque .",
    "_ magnetic dynamics in the absence of spin transfer torques .",
    "_ when a magnetic configuration is away from equilibrium , the magnetization precesses around the instantaneous local effective field . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "the magnetization distribution stays on a constant energy surface . in order to account for energy loss , landau and",
    "lifshitz @xcite introduced a phenomenological damping term into the equation of motion and gilbert @xcite introduced a slightly different form several decades later . both forms of the damping move the local magnetization vector toward the local effective field direction : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath24 is the landau - lifshitz damping parameter , and @xmath25 is the gilbert damping parameter .",
    "these two forms are known to be equivalent with the substitutions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in spite of this equivalence ,",
    "there has been an ongoing debate about which is more correct .",
    "this debate has been rekindled with the interest in current - driven domain wall motion ( one of the present authors is guilty of contributing to the debate ) and is mentioned in the articles by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer and by berkov and miltat .",
    "part of the fervor of the debate arises from the fact that it is not experimentally testable .",
    "appropriate equations of motion can be formulated with either form of damping at the expense of slight modifications to other terms in the equation of motion .",
    "this point is discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : wires ] . note that both the precession and damping terms rotate the magnetization , but do not change its length .",
    "this is consistent with treating the magnetization as having a fixed length .",
    "there have been many attempts to compute the damping parameters from models for various physics processes @xcite .",
    "some mechanisms are intrinsic to the material , such as those due to magnetoelastic scattering @xcite , and others are considered extrinsic like two - magnon scattering from inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "it appears that a model due to kambersky @xcite for electron - hole pair generation describes the dominant source of intrinsic damping in a variety of metallic systems including the ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite and transition metals @xcite primarily of interest for spin transfer torque applications . for a magnetic element in metallic contact with other materials",
    ", there can also be a contribution to the damping from `` spin - pumping ''  the emission of spin - angular momentum from the precessing magnet via the conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "magnetization dynamics is most easily investigated using the macrospin approximation .",
    "the macrospin approximation assumes that the magnetization of a sample stays spatially uniform throughout its motion and can be treated as a single macroscopic spin . since the spatial variation of the magnetization",
    "is frozen out , exploring the dynamics of magnetic systems is much more tractable using the macrospin approximation than it is using full micromagnetic simulations .",
    "the macrospin model makes it easy to explore the phase space of different torque models , and it has been a very useful tool for gaining a zeroth - order understanding of spin - torque physics",
    ". however , for many systems of interest , even ones with very small magnetic elements , the macrospin approximation breaks down . for a full understanding of magnetic dynamics ,",
    "a micromagnetic approach is therefore necessary .",
    "the article by berkov and miltat discusses some of the circumstances in which the macrospin approach is and is not a reasonable approximation to the true dynamics .    for analyses of magnetic domain wall dynamics , there is a different simplified description that can sometimes be useful for qualitative understanding , as an alternative to full micromagnetic calculations .",
    "the walker ansatz @xcite restricts the variation in the domain wall to uniform translations , uniform rotations out of plane , and in some versions a uniform scaling of the wall width . for the simplest version , the dynamics of the domain wall",

    "the article by beach , tsoi and erskine discusses when this approximation is valid and when it is not for current - induced domain wall motion .    in some situations",
    "it is useful to consider the dynamics of a magnetic sample in terms of the normal modes of the system , known as spin waves or magnons , instead of directly integrating the equations of motion at every point on a closely spaced grid designed to model the sample , as is usually done in micromagnetic calculations .",
    "a spin wave is a small amplitude oscillation of the magnetization around its average direction . in macroscopic magnetic systems ,",
    "the spectrum of spin waves is essentially continuous as a function of frequency , but when thin - film magnetic elements are shrunk to the scale of 100 nm in diameter , the spin wave spectrum becomes measurably discrete @xcite .",
    "in fact , the recent development of spin - transfer - driven ferromagnetic resonance has made it possible to measure the frequencies of these normal modes within individual nanostructures @xcite .",
    "interestingly , calculations show that uniform precession , of the type assumed in the macrospin approximation , is generally not a true normal mode because the magnetostatic field is generally not uniform across the sample .",
    "an analysis in terms of the normal modes can provide a strategy for simulating magnetic dynamics that is more efficient than standard micromagnetic simulations and somewhat more accurate than the macrospin approximation .",
    "the dynamics of a magnetic excitation can be approximated by expanding the excitation using a finite set of normal modes as a basis set , and determining the time dependence based on the dynamics of the individual modes and their nonlinear couplings , rather than by integrating the full equation of motion directly . in cases when the lowest - frequency most - spatially uniform normal mode dominates the magnetic dynamics , the results are typically very similar to the predictions of the simplest macrospin descriptions . the relevance of the spin wave modes is discussed in the articles by berkov and miltat and by sun and ralph .",
    "thus far we have discussed the dynamics of magnets in the absence of the spin transfer torque .",
    "spin transfer torques arise whenever the flow of spin - angular momentum through a sample is not constant , but has sources or sinks .",
    "this happens , for example , whenever a spin current ( created by spin filtering from one magnetic thin film ) is filtered again by another magnetic thin film whose moment is not collinear with the first . in the process of filtering , the second magnet necessarily absorbs a portion of the spin angular momentum that is carried by the electron spins .",
    "changes in the flow of spin angular momentum also occur when spin - polarized electrons pass through a magnetic domain wall or any other spatially non - uniform magnetization distribution . in this process ,",
    "the spins of the charge carriers rotate to follow the local magnetization , so the spin vector of the angular momentum flow changes as a function of position . in either of these cases ,",
    "the magnetization of the ferromagnet changes the flow of spin angular momentum by exerting a torque on the flowing spins to reorient them , and therefore the flowing electrons must exert an equal and opposite torque on the ferromagnet .",
    "this torque that is applied by non - equilibrium conduction electrons onto a ferromagnet is what we will call the spin transfer torque .",
    "its strength can be calculated either by considering directly the mutual precession of the electron spin and magnetic moment during their interaction ( an approach discussed in the article by haney , duine , nez , and macdonald ) or by considering the net change in the spin current before and after the interaction ( the approach we will emphasize ) .",
    "our discussion in this section will consist of two parts .",
    "first we will consider how it is that a spin - polarized current can apply a torque to a ferromagnet .",
    "this will be straightforward  since a torque is simply a time rate of change of angular momentum , considerations of angular momentum conservation can be used to relate the spin transfer torque directly to the angular momentum lost or gained by spin currents .",
    "we will use two simple toy models to illustrate some of the physics involved in this process .",
    "the second part of our discussion will describe how to incorporate the spin transfer torque into the equation of motion for the magnetization dynamics .",

    "first , the transverse ( perpendicular to @xmath47 ) spin component of the reflected spin current density is equal to zero .",
    "since the total spin current density is continuous at the interface , this means that all of the of the transverse component of the incident spin current density is transmitted through the interface ; none is reflected . in this toy model",
    ", this result follows from our assumption that for spin up electrons the height of the potential - energy step at the interface is zero , so that the reflection amplitude for spin up electrons is zero and the reflected part of the wavefunction is purely spin down . for models",
    "in which both components of spin experience a non - zero potential - energy step , some of the incident @xmath46 component of the spin current density will be reflected .",
    "however , for many of the materials combinations used commonly in metallic gmr devices , like cu / co , cu / ni , or cr / fe , one of the spin components actually does have a reflection amplitude close to zero over a large part of the fermi surface @xcite , so it is a reasonable approximation in these cases that almost all of the transverse ( @xmath46 ) component of the spin current density will be transmitted into the ferromagnet .",
    "the second important point of physics illustrated by the model concerns what happens to the transverse component of the spin current density after it enters the ferromagnet .",
    "the oscillatory @xmath40 and @xmath69 terms in the transmitted spin current density represent precession of the spin about the @xmath47 axis as a function of position as it penetrates through the magnet . in any model",
    "in which there is a difference in exchange energy between majority and minority spin states , the two spin components of a wavefunction for a given eigenvalue @xmath73 must have different kinetic energies , so that @xmath78 and the spin state inside the magnet will precess .",
    "the same phenomenon is therefore present in more rigorous models .",
    "one can view this effect as simply the precession of the spin in the exchange field of the magnet .",
    "the period of the precession , @xmath79 is very short for a typical transition metal ferromagnet , on the scale of a few atomic lattice spacings .",
    "this is important because in real 3-dimensional samples many electrons are incident on the magnetic layer from a variety of directions , corresponding to states from all parts of the fermi surface , and therefore different electrons take different paths through the magnetic layer .",
    "even if all of the electrons begin with perfectly aligned spins at the normal - metal / ferromagnet interface , electrons reaching a given depth inside the magnet will have traveled different path lengths to get there .",
    "the result is classical dephasing .",
    "electron spins that have traveled different path lengths will have precessed by different angles around the @xmath47 direction , and therefore their @xmath40 and @xmath70 components will not add constructively .",
    "for locations more than a few atomic lattice constants into a magnetic layer , when one sums over electrons from all relevant parts of the fermi surface in calculations that include first - principles computations of the transmission amplitudes @xcite , the transverse ( to @xmath47 ) components of the spins average to zero . as a consequence of this classical dephasing , there is no net transmission of transverse spin angular momentum through the ferromagnet .",
    "the transverse angular momentum that enters into the ferromagnet is effectively absorbed within a few atomic layers from the interface .    for a full calculation of the spin torque at an interface in a real 3-dimensional sample ,",
    "it is important to take into account not just propagating wavefunctions , but also evanescent scattering states at the interface .",
    "if our toy model # 2 is generalized to three dimensions , evanescent scattering wavefunctions are required in cases where the incident electron approaches the interface from a glancing angle , so that the part of the kinetic energy associated with the perpendicular wavevector is less than the step height @xmath3 . in calculations with more realistic band structures ,",
    "both evanescent and propagating scattering states can couple to incident bloch states more generally , and it is necessary to take the evanescent states into account to guarantee the continuity of the wavefunction and its first derivative on the atomic scale .",
    "although evanescent scattering states do not carry charge current , they do carry spin current , so that they can contribute a significant spin torque even when the net charge flow through the interface is zero .",
    "this point can be illustrated by our toy model if we consider a case in which the spin - dependent step heights are sufficiently high that both of the spin components are completely reflected .",
    "the transmitted and reflected parts of the scattering wavefunction are then @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are decay constants for the evanescent states in the ferromagnet . because the transmission and reflection amplitudes are now complex , with ( in general ) different complex phases for spin up and spin down electrons , the transmitted and reflected spin current densities will contain @xmath83 as well as @xmath46 components .",
    "the transmitted spin current density also decays exponentially to zero as a function of the penetration distance into the ferromagnet .",
    "what this means is that , in effect , the electron penetrates into the ferromagnet a distance on the order of @xmath84 and precesses around the exchange field as it does so , so that when it emerges from the magnet it is rotated away from its original orientation .",
    "consequently , during the process of reflection an electron can apply a torque to the magnet in both the in - plane and perpendicular directions .    in calculations with realistic band structures for normal - metal / ferromagnet interfaces , when one sums over the fermi surface to determine the total value of the transverse part of the reflected spin current there is significant ( but not perfect ) classical dephasing , so that the overall net flow of reflected transverse angular momentum is close to zero @xcite .",
    "this means that the incident transverse angular momentum that couples into the evanescent states can not end up flowing away from the interface through the reflected states . instead ,",
    "this transverse spin angular momentum is deposited in the interfacial region of the ferromagnet via the torque from the evanescent states .",
    "this contribution to the torque , which is not directly mediated by the propagating states , can be described as due to spin filtering . if one accounts for the evanescent states when constructing the scattering states but then ignores their contribution to the spin current , the spin - filtering contribution corresponds to the resulting interfacial discontinuity in the part of the spin current density carried by just the propagating states .",
    "the net result of the classical dephasing that occurs for both transmitted and reflected electron waves at a normal - metal / ferromagnet interface is that the total transmitted and reflected spin currents , summed over all relevant states on the fermi surface , are approximately collinear with the ferromagnetic layer s magnetization ( in the @xmath47 direction , in our toy model ) .",
    "since , to a good approximation , no transverse angular momentum flows away from the magnet , this collinearity means that approximately the _ entire _ incident transverse spin current is absorbed near the normal - metal / ferromagnet interface , and the spin transfer torque ( eq .  ( [ eq : pillbox ] ) ) becomes @xmath85    in terms of the parameters used in our first toy model above , it is correct to say that when summing or averaging over all contributions from around the fermi surface that to a good approximation for a typical metallic interface the dephasing leads to @xmath86 , and to a somewhat less - accurate approximation @xmath87 , so that on average for our one electron @xmath88 and the spin torque acting on the magnet per unit area is equal to the full component of incident spin current that is transverse to the ferromagnet s moment .    the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intabsorb ] ) is a good approximation for metallic interfaces , like cr / fe or cu / co , but the processes that lead to the simple form @xmath89 may be different for magnetic semiconductors or for tunnel junctions like fe / mgo / fe .",
    "most electrons that scatter from tunnel barriers reflect , whether they are majority or minority .",
    "in addition , tunneling is dominated by electrons that are largely from particular parts of the fermi surface , so the classical dephasing processes that are important for metallic junctions may be weaker in tunnel junctions .",
    "in fact , there is good evidence that @xmath90 in tunnel junctions , so that for large applied biases there can be a significant spin torque component in the @xmath70 direction ( perpendicular to the plane defined by the incoming electron spin and the ferromagnet s moment ) @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in the article by sun and ralph .    before moving on to consider how the spin torque will affect the ferromagnet s magnetization orientation , we wish to re - emphasize one last important point .",
    "spin currents can flow within parts of devices even where there is no net charge current .",
    "consequently , a spin transfer torque can also be applied to magnetic elements that do not carry any charge current @xcite .",
    "we have already noted two examples of this effect , in slonczewski s original calculation of interlayer exchange coupling in a magnetic tunnel junction @xcite and in our toy model # 2 for the case when both spin - up and spin - down components of the wavefunction are completely reflected .",
    "another important example occurs in multiterminal normal - metal / ferromagnet devices , which are designed so that a charge current flows only between two selected terminals , but diffusive spin currents may also flow throughout the rest of the device .",
    "the groups of johnson , van wees , and others have demonstrated non - local spin accumulation in nonmagnetic wires using multiterminal devices @xcite .",
    "kimura et al .  have used a similar lateral device design to demonstrate spin - torque - driven switching of a thin - film magnetic element which carries no charge current @xcite .",
    "one can view this effect as due simply to a flow of spin - polarized electrons penetrating by diffusive motion into a magnetic element and transferring their transverse component of spin angular momentum , while an equal number of electrons exit the magnet with an average spin component collinear with the magnet so that they give no spin torque . in this way",
    "there can be a non - zero net spin current and therefore a non - zero spin torque on the magnet , even when there is no net charge current . thus far the switching currents required in the devices of kimura _",
    "et al_.  are larger than those needed to switch comparable magnetic elements in standard magnetic - multilayer pillar devices , because the magnitude of the spin current densities achieved in the lateral devices ( per unit injected charge current ) is smaller than in the multilayers .",
    "_ spin transfer torque and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation .",
    "_ to calculate the effects of the spin transfer torque on magnetic dynamics , in practice a term @xmath91 is generally simply inserted as an additional contribution on the right side of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : llg ] ) ) . however",
    ", this step deserves some careful consideration , as it involves a few subtle points of physics .",
    "first , this insertion assumes that the all of the angular momentum transferred from the transverse spin current density acts entirely to reorient the orientation of the ferromagnet rather than , for example , being absorbed in the excitation of short - wavelength magnon modes or being transferred directly to the atomic lattice .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable approximation for describing the experiments performed to date ; however , as we note below , the existing spin - torque measurements in metallic multilayer samples are not particularly quantitative .    a second simple matter",
    "to keep straight is the sign of the torque .",
    "an electron s magnetic moment is opposite to its spin angular momentum @xmath92 , where @xmath4 is the total spin and @xmath93 , and likewise in transition metal ferromagnets the magnetization is generally opposite to the spin density @xmath94 , where @xmath5 is here the spin density and @xmath95 is typically in the range -2.1 to -2.2 @xcite .",
    "we have defined @xmath96 as a time rate of change of angular momentum . since the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation",
    "is stated in terms of magnetization , the contribution of the spin transfer torque should enter this equation with a sign opposite to the change in angular momentum . in the end",
    ", the sign of the spin transfer torque is such as to rotate the spin angular momentum density of the ferromagnet toward the direction of the spin of the incoming electrons , or equivalently to rotate the magnetization of the ferromagnet toward the direction of the moment of the incoming electrons .",
    "a third , potentially much more consequential , subtlety involves the orbital contribution to the magnetization .",
    "if we assume that all of the angular momentum in the ferromagnet is due to its spin density , then conservation of angular momentum implies that the effect of spin transfer torque on the magnetization can be described simply by inserting @xmath97 into the right side of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : llg ] ) ) . here",
    "@xmath98 is the volume of the ferromagnet ( free layer ) over which the spin torque @xmath96 is applied .",
    "ignoring any orbital contribution is a reasonable first - order approximation , because the orbital moments in transition metal ferromagnets are largely quenched by the strong hybridization of the d electrons .",
    "however , spin - orbit coupling does give rise to a weak orbital moment , typically less than a tenth of the spin moment as indicated by the deviation of @xmath95 from -2 . in a more precise treatment that takes the orbital contribution into account ,",
    "the total angular momentum density would be @xmath99 , and the magnetization would be @xmath100 , so that there might not be any simple proportionality between the total angular momentum density and @xmath101 .",
    "this would necessitate a significantly more complicated picture , as described in more detail immediately below .",
    "however , in most analyses of spin transfer torques , the potential effects of orbital moments are ignored , and it is assumed that the spin torque is simply described by eq .",

    "this is done either by making this layer much thicker than the other , so that it is more difficult to excite by spin torque , or by fabricating it in contact with an antiferromagnetic layer , which produces an effective field ( `` exchange bias '' ) and increases the damping , which both act to keep the ferromagnetic layer pinned in place .",

    "small device sizes are also convenient for understanding spin - torque - generated magnetic dynamics because the macrospin approximation can become a reasonable approximation , and of course small devices are desired for many applications .",
    "two general experimental approaches are used to direct current flow through an area @xmath124  nm wide in a magnetic multilayer .",
    "one is to make electrical contact to an extended multilayer substrate in a `` point contact '' geometry , made either mechanically with a very sharp tip @xcite or using lithography techniques @xcite .",

    "spin pumping refers to the fact that a precessing magnetization can produce a non - zero spin current density in a magnetic device , in addition to the spin current density generated directly by any applied bias .",
    "the total spin torque on the moving magnetization should be determined from the divergence of the total spin current arising from both sources . however , typically the primary effect of spin pumping is merely to increase the effective damping of the ferromagnet in a way that is independent of bias ( although it may depend strongly on the precession angle @xcite ) , so that spin pumping can be taken into account approximately just by renormalizing the damping constant .",
    "then the spin transfer torque even on a moving magnetization configuration can be determined , approximately , from the divergence of just the bias - dependent part of the spin current density .",
    "once the spin torque is calculated , the response of the magnetization is generally determined by inserting this torque as an additional contribution to the classical landau - lifshitz gilbert equation of motion ( eq .  ( [ eq : llg ] ) ) .",
    "the article by haney , duine , nez , and macdonald describes this consensus approach as the `` bookkeeping theory . ''",
    "spin pumping can also be incorporated into fully self - consistent solutions without too much extra difficulty , because spin pumping is local in time , depending only on @xmath101 and @xmath134 , and it can be calculated within the same type of theoretical framework needed for calculating the direct bias - generated spin torque @xcite .",

    "these processes are incorporated into the transport calculations as boundary conditions between the solutions of the transport equations in each layer , and the results are spin - dependent interface resistances @xcite ( or conductances ) . for spins that are not collinear ,",
    "transmission and reflection give rise both to boundary conditions on the transport calculations and also give the spin transfer torque . in the drift - diffusion approach ,",
    "the non - collinear boundary conditions are that the transverse spin current is proportional to the transverse spin accumulation @xmath135 where @xmath14 is the interface normal , @xmath136 is a characteristic velocity , @xmath137 is the transverse spin accumulation , and the @xmath138 superscript indicates that the transverse spin density and spin current are evaluated in the non - magnet as they are both zero in the ferromagnet .",
    "this boundary condition has a straightforward interpretation .",
    "since the interface acts as an absorber of any transverse spin component that scatters from it , there is no out - going spin current to cancel the incoming spin current , so there must be a net accumulation of transverse spins in the non - magnet near the interface . since the incident transverse spin current is equal to the spin transfer torque it is also the case that the transverse spin accumulation is proportional to the spin transfer torque .",
    "the relation leads some authors to discuss separate spin current and spin accumulation mechanisms for the spin transfer torque .",
    "however , from this discussion , we see that the two are intimately related , and the spin transfer torque can be fully accounted for in terms of the spin current ; there is not an extra separate contribution from spin accumulation .    for the case of a symmetric two - magnetic - layer device with a metal spacer , slonczewski @xcite calculated the spin transfer torque using a simplified boltzmann equation grafted with circuit theory .",

    "the sign of the torque observed experimentally agrees with the sign predicted by theory .    a sample excited into a state of dc - driven magnetic precession naturally emits a substantial microwave - frequency signal at its electrical contacts .",
    "the resistance is changing at microwave frequencies and a dc current is applied , so by ohm s law a microwave voltage is generated .",

    "these enhanced thermal magnetic oscillations can be measured accurately in tunnel junctions @xcite . in both tunnel junctions and metallic devices , room temperature thermal fluctuations",
    "can also cause magnetic switching to occur at currents that are well below the intrinsic zero - temperature threshold current for spin - transfer - driven instabilities ( eq .  ( [ eq : criti ] ) ) . in order to determine the intrinsic critical current for switching , it is necessary to make direct measurements of switching on the typical time scale of ferromagnetic precession near 1  ns , or measure the switching current as a function of temperature and extrapolate to zero temperature , or measure the statistics of switching using current pulses of various lengths and",
    "extrapolate to the ns scale .",
    "the linewidths of the microwave signals generated by spin - torque - driven magnetic precession appear to be governed largely by thermal fluctuations that produce deviations from perfectly periodic motion @xcite .",
    "point contact devices , in which magnetic precession is excited in a local area of an extended magnetic film can produce narrower linewidths than typical nanopillar devices @xcite , perhaps because the micromagnetic exchange coupling to the extended film makes them less susceptible to thermal fluctuations .",
    "if the effects of thermal fluctuations can be reduced or eliminated , it is likely that the ultimate limit on the linewidths of spin - torque nano - oscillators will be chaotic dynamics of the magnetization @xcite .    in terms of theory",

    "it is possible to include thermal effects into full micromagnetic simulations , but the calculations become quite time consuming and it is very difficult to capture meaningful statistics .    _ on the perpendicular component of the spin torque vector . _ in discussing the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intabsorb ] ) , _ i.e_.  that one expects essentially all of the transverse spin angular momentum incident onto a normal - metal / ferromagnet interface to be absorbed in producing the spin torque , we made the point that this was only approximately correct ; it is not exact .",
    "the most important caveat is that classical averaging over the fermi surface need not necessarily eliminate all transport of transverse spin density away from the interface , particularly for the reflected part of the scattering wavefunction ( or for very thin magnetic layers in transmission ) .",
    "one consequence is that the amplitude of the `` in - plane '' component of the torque can differ somewhat from eq .",
    "( [ eq : intabsorb ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is the possibility of an additional contribution due to the spin torque in the form @xmath166 oriented perpendicular to the plane defined by @xmath101 and @xmath153 , rather than within this plane as in eq .",

    "the out - of - plane torque component is sometimes referred to as an `` effective field '' contribution because its form is similar to the torque that would result from a field aligned with the fixed layer magnetization .",
    "it can be viewed as a consequence of a small amount of average precession into the @xmath69 direction for reflected electrons in our toy models from section [ sec : stt ] .",
    "calculations incorporating transmission and reflection coefficients computed by _ ab initio _ techniques find that the perpendicular component of the torque is small for the materials generally used in metallic multilayer devices . for electrons of a given energy , the out - of - plane component of spin transfer",
    "is predicted to be less than 10  % , and typically 1  % to 3  % of the in - plane component @xcite .",
    "the final magnitude of the bias - dependent part of the out - of - plane torque is expected to be smaller still , due to a cancellation that arises when computing the bias dependence .",
    "this cancellation is maximal in the case of a symmetric n / f / n / f / n junction , where it can be understood from a simple symmetry argument .",
    "consider a junction whose layer structure is perfectly symmetric about a plane at the midpoint of the device , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geomperp ] .",
    "assume that the magnetic moments of the two ferromagnetic layers are oriented in the plane of the sample layers , with an arbitrary angle @xmath48 between them .",
    "when a bias is applied to the junction , the resulting spin current density in each lead ( each of the outer n layers ) will be aligned with the magnetization of the neighboring ferromagnetic layer provided that the electrons that transmit into the lead from the rest of the devices are completely classically dephased . in this case , the spin currents in the outer n layers are oriented in the plane of the two magnetizations , and an out - of - plane spin component of the spin current density can exist only in the middle n layer .",
    "if there are no sources or sinks of angular momentum except for the spin torques applied to the magnetic layers ( _ e.g. _ , we assume that there is no angular momentum lost to the excitation of short - wavelength spin wave modes ) , then angular momentum conservation allows the perpendicular component of spin torques on the ferromagnetic layers to be determined solely from the out - of - plane spin current traveling between the magnetic layers . as a consequence",
    ", the out - of - plane spin torques on the two magnetic layers must be equal and opposite .",
    "( to be clear , our argument applies only to the perpendicular component of the spin torque and not the in - plane component , because the in - plane spin component of the spin - current density is not zero in the outer n layers , and hence the in - plane spin torques on the ferromagnetic layers are not generally equal and opposite . )    for an applied bias such that electrons flow from left to right , suppose that the perpendicular spin torque on the right magnetic layer has the value @xmath168 .",
    "now imagine that the bias is reversed , so that electrons flow from right to left .",
    "because of the symmetry of the device , the spin current density in this case can be determined from the first case simply by an appropriate rotation ; the answer is that both the direction of the out - of - plane spin component that flows between the two layers and the direction of its flow are reversed , so that ( multiplying the two negative signs ) the out - of - plane spin current density is actually _ the same _ as in the first case .",
    "consequently , the perpendicular spin torque acting on the right magnetic layer due to electrons flowing right to left will again be @xmath168 , the same magnitude and the same sign as for the perpendicular torque on the same ( right ) magnetic layer due electron flow from left to right .",
    "it follows that the perpendicular spin torque on a magnetic layer in a perfectly - symmetric junction is an even function of the bias @xmath169 , as long as conservation of angular momentum can be applied to the spin - transfer process and the classical dephasing processes are complete .",
    "consequently , there is no contribution that is linear in @xmath169 at zero bias in a symmetric junction , in spite of the fact that _ ab initio _ calculations show that electrons at a given energy incident onto a magnetic interface can give non - zero contributions to the perpendicular torque .    in a more microscopic picture",
    ", one can see how this result comes about by considering a calculation in which the total perpendicular spin torque is determined by integrating the contributions from all electrons incident onto the symmetric junction from both sides .",
    "following the logic of the symmetry argument above , the perpendicular torque due to incoming electrons in the energy range @xmath170 incident from the left should be the same , @xmath171 , as for electrons of the same energy incident from the right , as long as we assume that the effect of the applied bias on the scattering potential is sufficiently weak that the electron transmission and reflection amplitudes do not depend explicitly on @xmath169 . for a symmetric junction ,",
    "any applied voltage bias will offset the electron chemical potential on the two sides of the device by @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , if we consider only elastic scattering processes , the bias - dependent part of the perpendicular torque can be calculated by subtracting the contributions of electrons in the energy range @xmath173 to @xmath174 that are no longer incident on the junction from one side , and adding the contribution of the extra electrons in the range @xmath174 to @xmath175 that are incident from the other side : @xmath176 the contributions from the states in the energy ranges @xmath173 to @xmath174 and @xmath174 to @xmath175 cancel to first order in @xmath177 , so that the lowest - order contribution to the perpendicular spin torque should go only as @xmath178 , symmetric in @xmath169 with no linear term . even at non - zero biases",
    "the perpendicular component of the spin torque is probably very small in most metallic multilayers .",
    "predictions for non - zero values of the perpendicular torque typically arise only under the assumption of coherent transport between ideal interfaces , but in real devices this coherence is generally not present due to interface disorder @xcite .    for tunnel junctions , the bias - dependent part of the out - of - plane spin torque is predicted to be larger than for metallic multilayers @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question as to how well our symmetry argument applies to tunnel junctions , because the current may be dominated by a small part of the fermi surface .",
    "in such systems , classical dephasing may not be as complete and therefore in principle a small linear - in-@xmath169 out - of - plane torque may remain even for a symmetric junction .",
    "in addition , for tunnel junctions at high bias , angular momentum loss from hot electrons to the excitation of short - wavelength spin waves might become significant , which would invalidate our arguments because they are based on angular momentum conservation between the conduction electrons and the approximately uniform magnetization mode .",
    "nevertheless , a tight - binding calculation designed to model a symmetric magnetic tunnel junction ( in the absence of any short wavelength spin - wave excitations ) did predict a bias dependence @xmath179 @xcite , consistent with the symmetry argument . for a tunnel junction device with a non - symmetric layer structure none of the symmetry arguments apply , and in this case one should expect that there may be a perpendicular spin torque with a linear dependence on @xmath169 near zero bias .",
    "the potential absence of complete classical dephasing in magnetic tunnel junctions , the consequences of spin - wave excitation by hot electrons , and the effects of non - symmetric layer structures are all interesting questions for future theoretical work , as is the effect of disorder on the out - of - plane torque .",
    "the experimental literature regarding the perpendicular component of spin torque contains some contradictory results .",
    "recent spin - transfer ferromagnetic resonance measurements ( st - fmr ) on metallic nife / cu / nife devices find no sign of a perpendicular torque at the level of 1  % of the in - plane torque @xcite , in agreement with the theoretical expectations .",
    "however , zimmler",
    "_ et al_.  interpreted a measurement on co / cu / co devices @xcite of a non - zero slope _",
    "vs_.  current for the critical magnetic field for switching @xmath180 at 4.2 k as demonstrating a perpendicular torque linear in @xmath169 with a magnitude about 20 % of the in - plane torque .",
    "we are skeptical of this interpretation , and suspect that the observation might be an artifact of heating .",
    "the measured slope of @xmath180 was not actually constant as a function of @xmath141 as would be expected from a perpendicular torque , but rather the slope of @xmath180 was approximately zero except for combinations of current polarity and magnetic orientation for which the spin torque decreases the effective magnetic damping .",
    "this asymmetric rounding of the critical field line can be viewed as a signature of thermally induced fluctuations @xcite , in that a decreased effective damping can increase the amplitude of thermal fluctuations and therefore decrease the measured switching field at non - zero temperature .",
    "et al_.  attempted to correct for this temperature effect in their analysis , but did not consider that the temperature might be varying as a function of current due to heating at 4.2 k.    spin - transfer fmr measurements on symmetric magnetic tunnel junctions differ from experiments on magnetic multilayers in that the perpendicular torques found in the tunnel junctions are significant @xcite . in agreement with our symmetry argument and with more detailed calculations @xcite",

    "the article by sun and ralph describes in more detail the similarities and differences between spin torques in metal multilayers and tunnel junctions .",
    "_ comparison between theory and experiments .",
    "_ while there is a general consensus about the correct approach for calculating spin transfer torques in magnetic multilayers , there is as of yet no fully quantitative comparison between theory and experiment in metallic multilayers .",
    "the primary difficulty is that the torques themselves are generally not measured directly , but only the resulting dynamics as inferred from the time dependent resistance .",
    "spin - transfer - driven ferromagnetic resonance may eventually enable more direct quantitative measurements , but so far this has not been achieved for the in - plane component of the spin - torque in metal multilayers . as described in the article by berkov and miltat , attempting to infer the dynamics of a magnetic sample from its time dependent resistance is highly non - trivial and may hide the details of the torque .",
    "the problem is particularly complicated because it is difficult to determine simply from resistance measurements the degree to which spin - torque induced excitations are spatially non - uniform .",
    "the most sophisticated calculations can make very good qualitative predictions concerning , for example , the different types of dynamical modes ( static or precessional ) that are observed experimentally .",
    "however , they currently do not match experiment well in more quantitative comparisons , for instance in comparing to the current - dependent amplitude of the microwave signals emitted in the steady - state precession regime ( see the article by berkov and miltat ) .",
    "another complication is that there is still some variation experimentally between the behaviors of nominally identical samples .",
    "this degree of variability has improved since spin transfer effects were first measured , so that quantities like switching currents and precession frequencies now show good reproducibility . however , other quantities , _ e.g. _  microwave linewidths and the positions of transitions between different precession modes , are much more variable .",
    "the variability that still exists highlights the importance of achieving improved control over materials and lithography .",
    "in this section we provide a very brief introduction to current - induced domain wall motion . this section is brief compared to the previous section because the articles by beach , tsoi , and erskine , by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer , and by ohno and dietl together provide a rather comprehensive introduction , review , and summary of open questions for this topic .",
    "experimentally , current - induced domain wall motion is typically studied in lithographically defined , narrow magnetic wires .",
    "the wires are frequently curved or the ends are designed to make it possible to controllably introduce a domain wall into the wire using an applied field . in early experiments , the positions of the domain walls were imaged using techniques such as magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) @xcite or scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis ( sempa ) @xcite .",
    "measuring the positions before and after a current pulses allows estimates of the wall velocities .",
    "alternatively , the locations of the wall could be determined in real time using the magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) @xcite or electrically using gmr sandwich structures @xcite or through the extra resistance due to anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) in a domain wall @xcite . using these various techniques , experimentalists can determine the wall velocity as a function of current and applied magnetic field and compare with theoretical predictions .",
    "the level of the comparison is discussed in detail in the article by beach , tsoi , and erskine .    to a first approximation ,",
    "understanding current - induced domain wall motion is quite simple @xcite .",
    "assuming that the electron spins adiabatically follow the magnetization direction , the divergence of the spin current in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdef ] ) gives a torque ( actually a torque density , but for the rest of the article we refer to it simply as a torque ) on the magnetization of @xmath182 .",
    "here , @xmath183 is a vector in the current direction with magnitude @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the polarization of the current .",
    "if the current is uniform , this torque density simply translates the domain wall in the direction of electron flow with a speed @xmath186 .",
    "there are several factors that complicate this simple description .",
    "these factors are described in the three articles by beach , tsoi , and erskine , by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer , and by ohno and dietl .    the degree to which the spins adiabatically follow the magnetization has been computed in several models @xcite .",
    "the deviations are small except for rather narrow domain walls . when they are non - negligible , there is an additional torque in the @xmath187 direction .",
    "this torque is referred to as a non - adiabatic torque because it derives from the inability of the electron spins to adiabatically follow the magnetization direction .",
    "much of the debate on the theoretical description of current - induced domain wall motion is associated with how to describe the damping and whether there is an additional torque in the direction of the non - adiabatic torque @xcite that arises from the same processes that lead to damping .",
    "this torque , while not related to a true non - adiabatic torque is still sometimes called a non - adiabatic torque .",
    "alternatively , sometimes it is called the beta term , because @xmath188 is the dimensionless parameter that is frequently used to characterize its strength .",
    "this contribution is extensively discussed by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer .",
    "one technical aspect , whether the adiabatic spin transfer torque can be derived from an energy functional , is addressed in the article by haney , duine , nez , and macdonald .",
    "one of the present authors believes that their argument is incorrect , but disagreement is one of the things that makes an issue an open question .    just as the dynamics of the free magnetic layers in nanopillars",
    "are complicated by the possibility of spatially non - uniform magnetization patterns , so are the dynamics of domain wall motion complicated by non - trivial wall structures . when the domain patterns distort , the motion is no longer simple .",
    "domain walls distort in response to non - adiabatic torques , damping , and the presence of non - uniformities in the sample .",
    "the non - uniformities are frequently described as pinning centers .",
    "they have been studied extensively in the context of field driven domain wall motion as discussed by both beach , tsoi , and erskine and ohno and dietl .",
    "much experimental effort is spent on trying to minimize and understand the effects of these pinning centers .",
    "in this article , we have tried to highlight some of the open questions in the study of spin transfer torques and provide background material for the succeeding articles . as katine and fullerton describe , spin transfer torques should start having commercial impact in the very near future , but there are still important scientific issues to work through .",
    "it seems likely that tunnel junctions will be an important system for applications of spin transfer torques .",
    "sun and ralph discuss what is known about spin transfer torques in magnetic tunnel junctions as well as what we still need to learn .",
    "the dynamics that result from spin transfer torques is the topic of the articles by berkov and miltat and by silva and rippard .",
    "the former focuses primarily on the nanopillar geometry with a free layer that is patterned to have a finite extent .",
    "the latter focuses on the fabricated nanocontact geometry in which the free layer is part of an extended thin film . both show that the agreement between theory and experiment is still incomplete .",
    "the developments in current - induced domain wall motion are more recent than those in magnetic multilayers and tunnel junctions , so applications are still more uncertain . as beach , tsoi , and erskine describe , the experiments are rapidly becoming more sophisticated and more meaningful results are appearing .",
    "tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer describe the rapid progress in the theory of spin transfer torques in these systems .",
    "it is likely that experimental progress will challenge these theories and more work will be required .",
    "most research on spin transfer torques has focused on transition metal ferromagnets , but there are other potentially interesting materials systems .",
    "ferromagnetic semiconductors are potentially exciting because they have magnetizations much smaller than transition metal magnets , so that their moments might be manipulated using spin transfer from much smaller currents than transition metal magnets . while the feasibility of a room - temperature dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor remains to be established , there are fascinating scientific questions to be understood about these materials and their interactions with current .",
    "ohno and dietl describe the measurements of current - induced domain wall motion in a dilute magnetic semiconductor and a theory that can be used to characterize the electrical and magnetic properties of these systems .",
    "haney , duine , nez , and macdonald describe a different way of computing spin transfer torques and apply it to novel systems .",

    ", the threshold for spin - torque - driven excitations is given by a particular current density , so that the critical current scales @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the device radius .",
    "reorientations produced by the current - induced oersted field will generally occur at a particular field magnitude @xmath194 , so that the threshold current for field - generated reorientations scales @xmath195 , approximately .",
    "therefore a sufficiently small device radius is needed if one desires that the threshold for spin - torque excitations should occur at a lower current than thresholds for magnetic - field - driven reorientations .",
