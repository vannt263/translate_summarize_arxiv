    "signals comprised of stream of pulses play a key role in many engineering applications , such as ultrasound imaging and radar ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in some applications , the signal under examination is known to be real and non - negative . for instance , in single - molecule microscopy we measure the convolution of positive point sources with the microscope s point spread function @xcite .",
    "another example arises from the problem of estimating the orientations of the white matter fibers in the brain using diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . in this application ,",
    "the measured data is modeled as the convolution of a sparse positive signal on the sphere , which represents the unknown orientations , with a known point spread function that acts as a low - pass filter @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses its attention on the model of _ positive stream of pulses_. in this model , the measurements are comprised of a sum of unknown shifts of a kernel @xmath0 with positive coefficients , i.e. @xmath1=\\sum_{m}c_{m}\\mathbf{g}\\left[k - k_{m}\\right]+\\tilde{\\mathbf{n}}[k],\\quad k\\in\\mathbb{z},\\quad c_{m}>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a bounded error term ( noise , model mismatch ) obeying @xmath3\\right|\\leq\\delta$ ] .",
    "we do not assume any prior knowledge on the noise statistics .",
    "the pulse @xmath0 is assumed to be a sampled version of a scaled continuous kernel , namely , @xmath4:=\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\sigma n}\\right)$ ] , where @xmath5 is the continuous kernel , @xmath6 is a scaling parameter and @xmath7 is the sampling interval .",
    "for instance , if @xmath0 is gaussian kernel , then @xmath8 denotes its standard deviation .",
    "the delayed versions of the kernel , @xmath9 $ ] , are often referred to as _ atoms_. we aim to estimate the set of delays @xmath10 and the positive amplitudes @xmath11 from the measured data @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the sought parameters of the stream of pulses model can be defined by a signal of the form @xmath13:=\\sum_{m}c_{m}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\left[k - k_{m}\\right],\\quad c_{m}>0,\\label{eq : x}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is the one - dimensional kronecker delta function @xmath15:= \\begin{cases } 1 , & k=0,\\\\ 0 & k\\neq 0 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] in this manner , the problem can be thought of as a sparse deconvolution problem , namely , @xmath16=\\left(\\mathbf{g}\\ast\\left(\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{n}\\right)\\right)[k],\\label{eq : model1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes a discrete convolution and @xmath18 $ ] is the error term .    the one - dimensional model can be extended to higher - dimensions . in this paper",
    "we also analyze in detail the model of two - dimensional positive stream of pulses given by @xmath19 & = & \\left(\\mathbf{g_{2}}\\ast\\left(\\mathbf{x_{2}}+\\mathbf{n}\\right)\\right)\\left[\\mathbf{k}\\right],\\label{eq : model2}\\\\   & = & \\sum_{m}c_{m}\\mathbf{g_{2}}\\left[\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right]+\\tilde{\\mathbf{n}}[\\mathbf{k}],\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20\\in\\mathbb{z}^{2}$ ] and @xmath21 is a two - dimensional pulse . as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the pulse is defined as a sampled version of a two - dimensional kernel @xmath22 by @xmath23=\\mathbf{g_2}\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{\\sigma_{1}n_{1}},\\frac{k_{2}}{\\sigma_{2}n_{2}}\\right)$ ] .",
    "the signal @xmath24:=\\sum_{m}c_{m}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\left[\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right],\\quad c_{m}>0,\\label{eq : x2}\\ ] ] defines the underlying parameters to be estimated , where here @xmath25 denotes the two - dimensional kronecker delta function . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume throughout the paper that @xmath26 .",
    "many algorithms have been suggested to recover @xmath27 from the stream of pulses @xmath28 .",
    "a naive approach would be to estimate @xmath27 via least - squares estimation .",
    "however , even if the convolution as in ( [ eq : model1 ] ) is invertible , the condition number of its associated convolution matrix tends to be extremely high .",
    "therefore , the recovery process is not robust ( see for instance section 4.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "suprisngly , the least - squares fails even in a noise - free environment due to amplification of numerical errors .",
    "we refer the readers to figure 1 in @xcite for a demonstration of this phenomenon .",
    "a different line of algorithms includes the well - known prony method , music , matrix pencil and esprit , see for instance @xcite .",
    "these algorithms concentrate on estimating the set of delays .",
    "once the set of delays is known , the coefficients can be easily estimated by least - squares .",
    "these methods rely on the observation that in fourier domain the stream of pulses model ( [ eq:1 ] ) reduces to a weighted sum of complex exponentials , under the assumption that the fourier transform of @xmath0 is non - vanishing .",
    "recent papers analyzed the performance and stability of these algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , as the fourier transform of the pulse @xmath0 tends to be localized and in general contains small values , the stability results do not hold directly for the stream of pulses model .",
    "furthermore , these methods do not exploit the positivity of the coefficients ( if it exists ) , which is the focus of this work .",
    "in recent years , many convex optimization techniques have been suggested and analyzed thoroughly for the task super - resolution .",
    "super - resolution is the problem of resolving signals from their noisy low - resolution measurements , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the main pillar of these works is the duality between robust super - resolution and the existence of an interpolating polynomial in the measurement space , called _",
    "dual certificate_. similar techniques have been applied to super - resolve signals on the sphere @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and to the recovery of non - uniform splines from their projection onto the space of low - degree algebraic polynomials @xcite .",
    "the problem of recovering a general signal @xmath27 ( not necessarily non - negative ) robustly from stream of pulses was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the duality between robust recovery and the existence of an interpolating function holds in this case as well .",
    "particularly , it turns out that robust recovery is possible if there exists a function , comprised of shifts of the kernel @xmath0 and its derivatives , that satisfies several interpolation requirements ( see lemma [ lemma : q ] ) . in this case , the solution of a standard convex program achieves recovery error ( in @xmath29 norm ) of @xmath30 , for some constant @xmath31 that depends only on the convolution kernel @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that the support of the recovered signal is clustered around the support of the target signal @xmath27 .",
    "the behavior of the solution for large @xmath32 is analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main insight of @xcite is that the existence of such interpolating function relies on two interrelated pillars .",
    "first , the support of the signal , defined as @xmath33\\text{\\ensuremath{\\neq}}0\\right\\ } $ ] , should satisfy a _ separation condition _ of the form @xmath34 for some kernel - dependent constant @xmath35 which does not depend on @xmath32 or @xmath8 .",
    "in the two - dimensional case , the separation condition gets the form . ]",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37\\in\\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] and @xmath38 .",
    "the second pillar is that the kernel @xmath0 would be an _",
    "admissible kernel_. an admissible kernel is a function that satisfies some mild localization properties .",
    "these properties are discussed in the next section ( see definition [ def : kernel ] ) .",
    "two prime examples for admissible kernels are the gaussian kernel @xmath39 and the cauchy kernel @xmath40 . in @xcite , the minimal separation constant @xmath41 which is required for the existence of the interpolating function ( and hence , for robust recovery ) was evaluated numerically to be 1.1 and 0.5 for the gaussian and cauchy kernels , respectively .",
    "inspired by the recent work on super - resolution of positive point sources @xcite , this work focuses on the model of positive stream of pulses .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we prove that in this case the separation condition is no longer necessary to achieve stable recovery .",
    "we generalize and improve the results of @xcite as discussed in detail in section [ sec : main - result ] .",
    "particularly , we show that positive signals of the form ( [ eq : x ] ) can be recovered robustly from the measurements @xmath28 ( [ eq : model1 ] ) and the recovery error is proportional to the noise level @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the recovery error grows exponentially with the density of the signal s support .",
    "we characterize the density of the support using the notion of rayleigh - regularity , which is defined precisely in section [ sec : main - result ] .",
    "the recovery error also depends on the localization properties of the kernel @xmath0 .",
    "a similar result holds for the two - dimensional case .",
    "we use the following notation throughout the paper .",
    "we denote an index @xmath43 by brackets @xmath44 $ ] and a continuous variables @xmath45 by parenthesis @xmath46 .",
    "we use boldface small and capital letters for vectors and matrices , respectively .",
    "calligraphic letters , e.g. @xmath47 , are used for sets and @xmath48 for the cardinality of the set .",
    "the @xmath49 derivative of @xmath5 is denoted as @xmath50 . for vectors ,",
    "we use the standard definition of @xmath51 norm as @xmath52\\right|^{p}\\right)^{1/p}$ ] for @xmath53 .",
    "we reserve @xmath7 to denote the sampling interval of ( [ eq:1 ] ) and define the support of the signal @xmath27 as @xmath54\\text{\\ensuremath{\\neq}}0\\right\\ } $ ] .",
    "we write @xmath55 to denote some @xmath43 satisfying @xmath56 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : main - result ] presents some basic definitions and states our main theoretical results .",
    "additionally , we give a detailed comparison with the literature .",
    "the results are proved in sections [ sec : proof_main_th ] and [ sec : proof_th2 ] .",
    "section [ sec : numerical - experiments ] shows numerical experiments , validating the theoretical results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the work and aims to suggest potential extensions .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that the underlying one - dimensional signal @xmath27 can be recovered robustly from a stream of pulses @xmath28 if its support satisfies a separation condition of the form ( [ eq:1dseparation ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , this work deals with non - negative signals and shows that in this case the separation condition is not necessary . specifically , we prove that the recovery error depends on the density of the signal s support .",
    "this density is defined and quantified by the notion of rayleigh - regularity .",
    "more precisely , a one - dimensional signal with rayleigh regularity @xmath57 has at most @xmath57 spikes within a resolution cell :    [ def : rayleigh]we say that the set @xmath58 is rayleigh - regular with parameters @xmath59 and write @xmath60 if every interval @xmath61 of length @xmath62 contains no more that @xmath57 elements of @xmath63 : @xmath64    equipped with definition [ def : rayleigh ] , we define the sets of signals @xmath65 we further let @xmath66 be the set of signals in @xmath67 with non - negative values .    if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 . if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 .",
    "besides the density of the signal s support , robust estimation of the delays and amplitudes also depends on the convolution kernel @xmath0 .",
    "particularly , the kernel should satisfy some mild localization properties . in short ,",
    "the kernel and its first derivatives should decay sufficiently fast .",
    "we say that a kernel @xmath0 is _ non - negative admissible _ if it meets the following definition :    [ def : kernel]we say that @xmath0 is a non - negative admissible kernel if @xmath72 for all @xmath45 , and :    1 .",
    "@xmath73 and is even . 2",
    "there exist constants @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "there exist constants @xmath76 such that 1 .",
    "@xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "now , we are ready to state our one - dimensional theorem , which is proved in section [ sec : proof_main_th ] .",
    "the theorem states that in the noise free - case , @xmath81 , a convex program recovers the delays and amplitudes exactly , for any rayleigh regularity parameter @xmath57 .",
    "namely , the convolution system is invertible even without any sparsity prior .",
    "additionally , in the presence of noise or model mismatch , the recovery error grows exponentially with @xmath57 and is proportional to the noise level .",
    "[ th : main]consider the model ( [ eq : model1 ] ) for a non - negative admissible kernel @xmath0 as defined in definition [ def : kernel ] .",
    "then , there exists @xmath35 such that if @xmath82 and @xmath83 the solution @xmath84 of the convex problem @xmath85 satisfies @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88    for sufficiently large @xmath41 and @xmath32 , the recovery error can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant that depends only on the kernel @xmath0 and @xmath57 .    in order to extend theorem [ th : main ] to the two - dimensional case , we present the equivalent of definitions [ def : rayleigh ] and [ def : kernel ] to two - dimensional signals . notice that the two - dimensional definition of rayleigh regularity is not a direct extension of definition [ def : rayleigh ] and is quite less intuitive . in order to prove theorems [ th : main ] and [ thm : main2 ] , we assume that the support of the signal could be presented as a union of @xmath57 non - intersecting subsets , which satisfy the separation conditions of ( [ eq:1dseparation ] ) and ( [ eq:2dseparation ] ) , respectively . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "this property is implied directly from definition [ def : rayleigh ] . however , this property is not guaranteed by the two - dimensional extension of definition [ def : rayleigh ] .",
    "see figure [ fig : counter_exp ] for a simple counter - example .",
    "therefore , in the two - dimensional case the rayleigh - regularity of a signal is defined as follows :    [ def:2dray]@xcite we say that the set @xmath91 is rayleigh - regular with parameters @xmath59 and write @xmath92 if it can be presented as a union of @xmath57 subsets @xmath93 that are not intersecting and satisfy the minimum separation constraint ( [ eq:2dseparation ] ) .",
    "namely ,    * for all @xmath94 , @xmath95 , * for all @xmath96 , @xmath97 satisfies : for all square subsets @xmath98 of side length @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "this figure presents an example for a set of 8 points that can not be decomposed into 4 non - intersecting subsets that meet the separation condition as in ( [ eq:2dseparation ] ) , although each resolution cell contains at most 4 points .",
    "consider a square resolution cell ( in @xmath101 sense ) of size @xmath102 .",
    "note that indeed each resolution cell contains at most 4 points .",
    "nonetheless , this set of points can not be described as 4 non - intersecting sets that satisfy the separation condition . specifically , the distance ( in @xmath103 norm ) of the black point is smaller than @xmath104 from the other 7 points , meaning it has to be in a separate subset from the others .",
    "on the other hand , there is no triplet of points that comprises a legal subset .",
    "therefore , the property of definition [ def:2dray ] is not a consequence of the two - dimensional version of definition [ def : rayleigh ] . ]",

    "particularly , we stress the chief differences from @xcite which served as inspiration for this work .    *",
    "this work deviates from @xcite in two important aspects .",
    "first , our stability results is much stronger than those in @xcite .",
    "particularly , our main results hold for signals with @xmath57 spikes within a resolution cell . in contrast , the main theorems of @xcite require signals with @xmath57 spikes within @xmath57 resolution cells .",
    "second , our formulation is not restricted to kernels with finite bandwidth and , in this manner , can be seen as a generalization of @xcite .",
    "this generalization is of particular interest as many kernels in practical applications are not band - limited . * in @xcite",
    ", it is proven that robust recovery from general stream of pulses ( not necessarily non - negative ) is possible if the delays are not clustered . here",
    ", we show that the separation is unnecessary in the positive case and can be replaced by the notion of raleigh regularity .",
    "this notion quantifies the density of the signal s support .",
    "* we derive strong stability guarantees compared to parametric methods , such as prony method , matrix pencil and music .",
    "nevertheless , we heavily rely on the positiveness of signal and the density of the delays , whereas the parametric methods do not have these restrictions .",
    "we also mention that several previous works suggested noise - free results for non - negative signals in similar settings , however they do not derive stability guarantees @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that the necessary separation between the delays drops to zero for sufficiently low noise level .",
    "the proof follows the outline of @xcite and borrows constructions from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 be s solution of ( [ eq : cvx ] ) and set @xmath127 .",
    "observe that by ( [ eq : cvx ] ) @xmath128 is finite since @xmath129 .",
    "the proof relies on some fundamental results from @xcite ( particularly , see proposition 3.3 and lemmas 3.4 and 3.5 ) which are summarized by the following lemma :    [ lemma : q ] let @xmath0 be a non - negative admissible kernel as defined in definition [ def : kernel ] and suppose that @xmath130",
    ". then , there exists a kernel - dependent separation constant @xmath35 ( see ( [ eq:1dseparation ] ) ) and a set of coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 such there exists an associated function of the form @xmath133 which satisfies : @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the constants associated with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath137    the non - negativity property , @xmath138 for all @xmath45 , does not appear in @xcite , however , it is a direct corollary of the non - negativity assumption that @xmath72 for all @xmath45 .",
    "the interpolating function ( [ eq : q_form ] ) also satisfies the following property which will be needed in the proof :    [ claim : qh ] let @xmath84 be s solution of ( [ eq : cvx ] ) and set @xmath127 .",
