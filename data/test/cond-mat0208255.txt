    "recently there was a considerable amount of studies of the pseudogap phenomenon observed in a variety of experiments on the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) @xcite .",
    "there are two main theoretical interpretations which are presently widely considered in the literature : ( i ) the pseudogap as a precursor of the emerging pairing fluctuations , and ( ii ) the pseudogap understood in terms of some new ( hidden ) ordering taking place in a vicinity of the superconducting phase .",
    "some selective overview can be found e.g.  in the recent monograph @xcite .    among theoretical attempts to explain the pseudogap effect of htsc materials there is a model of itinerant electrons or holes which coexist and interact with the local bound pairs ( hard - core bosons ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the pseudogap has been foreseen within this boson fermion ( bf ) model a long time before the convincing experimental data became available ( see the last paragraph in section iv of the ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "pseudogap phase of the bf model is a manifestation of the pairing - wise correlations which start to appear in a system when the transition temperature @xmath4 is approached from above ( the precursor type interpretation ) . on a microscopic basis",
    "it means that below a certain temperature @xmath5 fermions start to couple into the pairs .",
    "these are , however , weakly ordered in phase due to the small superfluid stiffness .",
    "the phase coherence sets in at a sufficiently low temperature @xmath6 and then the true superconducting transition occurs .",
    "presence of the incoherent ( @xmath7 ) or the coherent ( @xmath8 ) fermion pairs is accompanied by either the pseudogap or the true superconducting gap formed around the fermi energy @xmath9 .    in general ,",
    "some advanced methods of the many body theory are required to explore a pseudogap phase within any model .",
    "it is because the single - particle and the two - particle correlations are then of equal importance .",
    "they should be properly treated taking account of possible feedback effects between both channels in a controlled way . in a context of the bf model",
    "such requirements were obtained so far via : a ) the selfconsistent perturbative investigation @xcite , b ) the dynamical mean field theory @xcite , and c ) the flow equation study @xcite .",
    "some alternative way was studied by micnas _",
    "et al _ @xcite who considered the kosterlitz - thouless criterion for determination of the superconducting transition @xmath10 and identified @xmath5 with the mean field estimate @xmath11 .",
    "authors were able to reproduce qualitatively the uemura type plots @xmath4 versus @xmath12 .    in this short paper",
    "we extend our previous study @xcite to analyze the pseudogap shape and its variation with temperature .",
    "direct consequences of the particle - hole asymmetric pseudogap are illustrated on an example of the stm current conductance .",
    "we consider the bf model which is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the boson energy , @xmath16 is the chemical potential .",
    "the second quantization operators @xmath17 refer to the conduction band particles ( electrons or holes ) and @xmath18 to the composite hard - core bosons ( for instance they can represent the trapped electron pairs @xmath19 ) .",
    "itinerant fermions propagate between the lattice sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 via the hopping integral @xmath22 whereas bosons are assumed to be infinitely heavy .",
    "the hard - core property of bosons means that either @xmath23 or @xmath24 boson is allowed to occupy a given lattice site .",
    "this local constraint can be formally expressed @xcite through the following semi - bosonic commutation relations @xmath25",
    "= \\delta_{i , j } \\left(1 - 2b_{i}^{\\dagger}b_{i}\\right)$ ] and @xmath26 = 0=\\left[b_{i}^{\\dagger},b_{j}^{\\dagger}\\right]$ ] .",
    "mechanism of superconductivity and all the other forms of correlations in the bf model ( [ bf ] ) are caused by the boson fermion charge exchange potential @xmath27 . by decaying into the fermion pairs ,",
    "bosons gain effectively some mobility .",
    "if temperature decreases below the critical value @xmath4 then ( for @xmath28 ) some fraction of bosons gets `` frozen '' into the be condensate @xmath29 . for @xmath30 ,",
    "fermions are simultaneously driven into the broken symmetry superconducting state .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the energy gap in the superconducting fermion subsystem is @xmath31",
    ".    for temperatures slightly higher than @xmath4 there exist many bosons which occupy the small momenta @xmath32 states . because of the interaction @xmath33",
    ", these boson states @xmath34 are strongly mixed with the fermion states @xmath35 @xmath36 and thereby the life time of fermions might be reduced , especially for @xmath37 . in consequence",
    ", we expect that the fermion density of states might be suppressed near @xmath9 .    with the on - site boson fermion interaction given in ( [ bf ] )",
    "one can generate only the isotropic gap / pseudogap .",
    "of course , the htsc materials are characterized by the anisotropic order parameters of the @xmath38-wave symmetry with a possible admixture of the @xmath39-wave component @xcite . to capture this aspect",
    "it is enough to introduce the intersite coupling @xmath40 when both , the superconducting gap @xcite and the pseudogap @xcite become anisotropic .",
    "here we only discuss the results for the isotropic case but , at a price of more difficult numerical computations , the same procedure can be easily extended to the anisotropic pairing .",
    "in order to determine the effective fermion and boson spectra of the model ( [ bf ] ) we utilize the flow equation technique proposed by wegner @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind is to disentangle the coupled boson and fermion subsystems via a sequence of canonical transformations @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a continuous parameter .",
    "we start at @xmath43 by putting @xmath44 , and proceed till @xmath45 , when we want to obtain @xmath46 .",
    "all the way , from @xmath43 to @xmath45 , we adjust the operator @xmath47 according to the wegner s prescription @xcite . in practice , disentangling of fermion from boson subsystem can be done within an accuracy of the order @xmath48 @xcite . to simplify the matters we neglect the hard - core constraint and use the pure bosonic relations",
    "@xmath49 \\simeq \\delta_{i , j}$ ] which should be valid for small boson concentrations @xmath50 .",
    "after the disentangling procedure is finished we obtain the following structure for the boson contribution to the effective hamiltonian @xmath51 .",
    "the initial boson energy @xmath15 is thus transformed into the dispersion @xmath52 which is characterized by the width proportional to @xmath53 and the effective boson mass comparable with the mass of fermions @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 part , on the other hand , is given as @xmath55 .",
    "renormalization of @xmath56 with respect to the initial dispersion @xmath57 takes place mainly around @xmath58 .",
    "there is also induced the long range fermion - fermion interaction @xmath59 which has somewhat unusual resonant - like character as shown in figs 7 and 8 of @xcite for the bcs @xmath60 and for the density - density @xmath61 channels .",
    "previously @xcite we discussed the fermion spectrum only on a basis of the quasiparticle energy @xmath56 .",
    "however , in some cases , a considerable influence may also arise from the fermion - fermion interactions .",
    "these interactions are in principle small , @xmath62 is of the order @xmath53 , so we can treat them perturbatively .",
    "the effective dispersion @xmath63 is for @xmath64 given by @xmath65 at @xmath66 one should also consider the other contribution coming from the bcs channel @xmath60 .",
    "we restrict our attention only to the normal phase ( @xmath64 ) .    in the left h.s .",
    "panel of figure [ figure1 ] we show the density of fermion states @xmath67 . note , that there appears a pseudogap which deepens with a decreasing temperature @xmath68 .",
    "the pseudogap structure has a clear particle - hole asymmetry at all the temperatures .",
    "asymmetry finally disappears at very high temperatures @xmath69 ( not shown here ) .",
    "the boson density of states @xmath70 is much less affected by a varying temperature ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) . however , upon decreasing @xmath68 we observe ( see the right h.s.panel of figure [ figure1 ] ) a considerable redistribution of boson occupancy @xmath71 , here @xmath72 is the bose einstein distribution . by comparing both the panels of figure [ figure1 ]",
    "we notice that the pseudogap builds up when bosons start populating the low energy states @xmath73 .",
    "asymmetry of the pseudogap structure is mainly controlled by the boson concentration @xmath74 .",
    "here is a simple argumentation .",
    "if the boson energy is located in a center of the fermion band ( @xmath75 ) , then for the exactly half - filled fermion and boson subsystems they both must have symmetric spectra . in particular , the pseudogap would then become symmetric too .",
    "for the situation presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we have @xmath76 , so it can only be the boson concentration @xmath74 responsible for the asymmetry of @xmath77 .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented in the future publication .",
    "our results , in particular effects of the particle - hole asymmetry , can be well illustrated by calculating the single particle tunneling current @xmath78 .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath79 as a function of bias voltage @xmath80 is a direct probe of the density of states below and above the fermi energy .",
    "we use the following expression for the stm current @xmath81 , \\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 stands for the fermi dirac distribution . as",
    "usually , we neglect the energy @xmath83 and @xmath84-dependence of the tunneling matrix @xcite .    in figure [ figure2 ]",
    "we show the conductance @xmath85 of the stm current ( [ j ] ) obtained for the same set of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we obtain the negative - positive asymmetric characteristics because , at low t , the conductance is roughly proportional to the density of states @xmath77 .",
    "our results agree very well with the experimental data reported by renner _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to pass through @xmath4 ( we solve the flow equations using the one dimensional tight binding dispersion @xmath57 @xcite when @xmath86 ) . however , for the realistic @xmath28 , we expect the asymmetry to survive even at @xmath66 as seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "let us point out the main features of the pseudogap probed experimentally by the stm conductance @xcite : ( i ) it is asymmetric , ( ii ) its magnitude ( the peak to peak distance ) is almost temperature independent , and ( iii ) the pseudogap deepens with a decreasing temperature while the coherence peaks gradually start to appear .",
    "the bf model is capable to reproduce all these features ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "some other theoretical concepts discussed in the literature to explain @xmath85 , e.g.  @xcite and references cited therein , are dealing with the physics which microscopically is very close to the bf model ( [ bf ] ) .    * acknowledgment * t.d .  kindly acknowledges hospitality of the j.  fourier university and centre de recherches sur les trs basses temperatures in grenoble , where this study was carried out .",
