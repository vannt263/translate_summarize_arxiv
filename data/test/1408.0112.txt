    "it is also found that the frequency never reaches the drake and lee semi - collisionless expression of , @xmath143 which are also plotted as horizontal dot - dashed lines , although a qualitative agreement as a function of the pressure gradient is seen i.e. with a larger background pressure gradient a larger maximal frequency is seen .",
    "it is also noted that the collisionality threshold at which the mode changes the sign of its rotation is a function of the pressure gradient , with a higher threshold seen at higher background gradients . while the mode start to be stabilised at a lower collisionality , the opposite relation .",
    "using the global version of the gyrokinetic code , gkw , the tearing mode has been studied in the linear regime for experimentally relevant paramerters in three dimensional , toroidal geometry for the first time .",
    "the collisionality , equilibrium temperature , density and current gradients were varied and their effects on the mode stability and frequency were analysed .",
    "the main results can be summarised as follows :    * the tearing mode growth rate scales with the resistivity close to the @xmath0 scaling as calculated by fitzpatrick @xcite in the semi - collisional , high @xmath128 regime as opposed to the semi - collisional scaling of @xmath147 found in the kinetic treatment of drake and lee . *",
    "the stability of the mode follows closely the stability calculated in cylindrical geometry performed by wesson et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis differs in that multiple rational surfaces may be present within the domain and so allows double tearing modes and toroidal coupling of modes , a process which is known to be destabilising , as such more modes are excited in our global toroidal treatment . *",
    "the mode is seen to rotate at the electron diamagnetic frequency when a pressure gradient is present , as is characteristic for the drift - tearing mode .",
    "however , this is a function of the collisionality and the sign of the rotation frequency is seen to change at a sufficienty high collisionality . * a residual non - zero , mode frequency ,",
    "is found for the classical tearing mode in three dimensional toroidal geometry , even when equilibrium pressure gradients are not included . suppressing toroidal drift effects",
    "recovers a zero mode frequency . * pressure gradient stabilisation of the mode is apparent , even though @xmath82 which determines the effective stabilisation , is small .",
    "linear mode evolution is valid only when the generated magnetic island is small compared to the resonant layer width , which in these simulations were smaller than the ion gyroradius .",
    "however , the mode frequency is important for the non - linear evolution of the magnetic island and in particular the polarisation current drive of the tearing mode , and its neoclassical modification , the neoclassical tearing mode , particularly when the magnetic island is small @xcite .",
