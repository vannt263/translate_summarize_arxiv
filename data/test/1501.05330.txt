    "measurements of the masses and radii of neutron stars provide unique information on the equation of state of matter at densities above the nuclear saturation density .",
    "extremely accurate mass measurements in binary systems can be obtained through dynamical methods ( see , e.g. , stairs 2006 ; demorest et al .",
    "however , without independent determinations of the radii of these neutron stars , these measurements provide only limits for the equation of state .",
    "in contrast , an accurate measurement of the radius of even a single neutron star can provide strong constrains on the equation of state of neutron star matter ( lattimer & prakash 2001 ; zel & psaltis 2009 ; read et al . 2009 ) .",
    "thermonuclear x - ray bursts observed from low mass x - ray binaries have proven to be one of the most suitable events that can be used to measure both the radii and the masses of neutron stars ( see , e.g. , van paradijs 1978 , 1979 ; damen et al . 1990 ; lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ; zel 2006 ) . using high signal - to - noise x - ray data and",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy allows a measurements of the apparent radius during the cooling segments of the bursts .",
    "in addition , time - resolved spectroscopy during a photospheric radius expansion burst enables a measurement of the eddington luminosity for each source . combining these two measurements leads to an uncorrelated determination of the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "thanks to the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , which provided more than 15 years of observations of bursts ( galloway et al .",
    "2008 ) , it has now become possible to not only make neutron star mass and radius measurements using observations of specific systems ( see , e.g. , zel , gver , & psaltis 2009 ) but also to quantify the systematic uncertainties in these measurements . in paper",
    "i of these series ( gver , psaltis , & zel 2012a ) , we analyzed more than 13,000 x - ray spectra from 12 different sources and showed that the errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron - star radii due to systematic effects in the cooling tails of x - ray bursts are in the range of @xmath23%@xmath08% . in paper",
    "ii ( gver , zel , & psaltis 2012b ) , we used all the archival photospheric radius expansion bursts and found that for sources from which a large number of bursts are observed , systematic uncertainties in the determination of the eddington flux are at the 5%@xmath010% level .    in this paper , we focus on a third possible source of systematic uncertainty , which is the absolute flux calibration of the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board rxte .",
    "absolute flux uncertainties affect the normalization of the spectra obtained during bursts and therefore the measurement of both the apparent radii and of the eddington flux .",
    "determining the absolute flux calibration of an x - ray detector requires a major effort from any instrument team and all x - ray observatories put large amount of resources into in - flight calibrations of their detectors .",
    "however , these efforts are hindered by the fact that almost all x - ray sources in the sky that may be used as standard candles often show unpredicted variability over both long and short time scales ( see , e.g. , wilson - hodge et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein for the recent activity of the crab nebula ) .",
    "additionally , complications due to significantly different responses of different detectors , both in terms of effective areas and the energy ranges that the detectors are sensitive to , become a major hurdle and restrict the inter - calibration efforts .",
    "furthermore , the often unknown intrinsic spectral shape of the astronomical objects being used for the calibration makes the problem even more complex .",
    "simultaneous observations of sources with well known intrinsic spectra by two or more x - ray detectors that have different energy responses allow us to better understand and quantify the systematic uncertainties in the absolute flux calibrations of individual detectors .    in the early days of high energy astrophysics ,",
    "the crab nebula was seen as the ideal stellar source for the calibration of various instruments . compiling a number of rocket , balloon , and satellite observations performed between 1964 and 1972 ,",
    "toor & seward ( 1974 ) concluded that the diffuse x - ray emission should be steady at least for the time period they analyzed , since any variation in the pulsar emission larger than 10% at a few kev would have been detected . with these limits",
    ", they assumed that the crab is a steady source and provided a `` universal '' power - law amplitude and photon - index with their relevant uncertainties . in the following years",
    ", these values were often cited and used as a reference point to calibrate the performance of various instruments .",
    "norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) even proposed a specific mission called _ excalibur _ to continuously monitor the crab nebula using two pinhole cameras one with a ccd and another with a proportional counter to measure the spectrum of the nebula with an accuracy @xmath32% over the energy range 0.8@xmath020  kev .",
    "such a mission could , in principle , be a reliable inter - calibration reference for subsequent detectors .    using the crab as a standard source , kirsch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) compared the xmm - newton / epic - pn measurements of the spectrum of crab with those from all the other modern x - ray satellites .",
    "in particular , they found that although the photon index inferred from xmm - newton / epic agrees within errors with the toor & seward ( 1974 ) value , the normalization derived from epic - pn is significantly lower than that from the rest of the instruments .",
    "they also noted that , with the new generation of instruments , crab is becoming a source that is too bright and too extended to be used as a standard calibration source . in a similar , later study , weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2010 ) investigated possible departures from a single power - law of the intrinsic spectrum of crab for rosat / pspc , rxte / pca , and the xmm - newton / epic - pn , which would affect the instrument calibrations . using the high statistical quality of the rxte / pca data",
    ", these authors concluded that they would have been able to detect significant deviations from a simple power - law spectrum but they did not find any evidence for such a deviation .    with the advancement of imaging detectors and considering the brightness of the crab for the onboard ccds , searches for new calibration sources and techniques started .",
    "in order to coordinate and improve the efforts on inter - calibration , a group of instrument teams formed the international astronomical consortium for high - energy calibration ( iachec , sembay et al . 2010 ) .",
    "one of the recent results of this group demonstrates that in the 2.0@xmath07.0  kev range , epic - pn measures systematically lower fluxes than the chandra acis , by 11.0@xmath10.5% ( nevalainen et al .",
    "2010 ) , using a sample of 11 nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "the difference is smaller yet still significant when acis is compared with epic mos1 and mos2 , with differences at 3.0@xmath10.5% and 6.0@xmath10.5% , respectively ( nevalainen et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements of neutron star masses and radii have been predominantly performed with rxte .",
    "launched in 1995 and operated until 2012 , rxte / pca has always been calibrated against the crab nebula ( jahoda et al .",
    "2006 ; shaposnikov et al .",
    "2012 ) together with an onboard calibration source used mainly for channel - to - energy conversion . throughout the mission , any possible variations in the crab , as the one reported by wilson - hodge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , were assumed to be averaged out ( shaposnikov et al .",
    "2012 ) ; this issue will be discussed further in section  [ variable_source ] . because the pca was intrinsically calibrated against the crab and because it is a non - imaging instrument , inter - calibration of the pca has always been a challenge , especially as more and more sources such as clusters of galaxies or similarly soft and relatively dim objects ( i.e. , rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 ) started to be used as standard candles .",
    "time resolved x - ray spectra extracted during thermonuclear x - ray bursts observed from low mass x - ray binaries offer a different opportunity in determining the systematic uncertainties caused by calibrations of different detectors . since the early studies of x - ray bursts , it has been shown that the burst x - ray spectra can statistically be modeled with blackbody functions ( see , e.g. , swank et al .",
    "1977 ; lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ; galloway et al .  2008 ) . in paper",
    "i , we analyzed more than 13,000 x - ray spectra extracted from the cooling tails of x - ray bursts observed from 12 different sources and showed that a planckian function can statistically fit the vast majority of the observations .",
    "the high count rates of rxte and the large number of bursts allowed us to show that any deviation from a planckian spectrum is limited to @xmath4 in the 2.5@xmath025.0  kev range .",
    "this almost unique characteristic of burst spectra make them ideal for testing our ability to convert countrate spectra to bolometric fluxes .",
    "furthermore , because the obtained spectral parameters are directly related to neutron star mass - radius measurements , results obtained from an analysis of x - ray burst data can be directly converted to uncertainties in the measurements of neutron star masses and radii .    using simultaneous rxte , chandra x - ray observatory ( chandra ) , and xmm-_newton _ observations of x - ray bursts from gs  1826@xmath0238",
    ", we quantify the differences in the measurements of the apparent surface area of the thermal emission when using different detectors with independent calibrations .",
    "we describe our method in section  2 , which is based on predicting the observed chandra and xmm-_newton _ countrates using time resolved spectral parameters obtained from rxte / pca .",
    "section  3 details the analysis of the data from different x - ray satellites .",
    "finally , in sections  4 and 5 we present our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the rapid evolution of the effective temperature during the cooling tails of thermonuclear x - ray bursts demands very short exposure time observations for direct comparison of spectral data that are obtained simultaneously .",
    "the short exposures require very high countrates and , hence , detectors with large photon collecting areas .",
    "this has been a unique property of rxte / pca but can not be achieved by the other instruments that we are going to compare its results against .",
    "therefore , we formulated an approach that does not rely on directly comparing the extracted spectra of x - ray bursts simultaneously observed with two ( or more ) x - ray satellites .",
    "instead , we first analyze the rxte data by performing time resolved x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "we extract spectra for short intervals ( 0.25@xmath02.0  s depending on the countrate ) and fit these data with blackbody functions . based on the obtained @xmath5 values",
    ", we then calculate the likelihood for a wide range of spectral parameters that cover the @xmath15@xmath6 range of the best fit values .",
    "we use this range of individual parameter pairs ( blackbody temperature and normalization ) to create simulations of chandra or xmm-_newton _ x - ray spectra and then to calculate the total rxte - predicted countrate in a given energy range .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty in these countrates by taking into account the posterior likelihoods of the rxte / pca parameters for each simulation . finally , we compare this predicted countrate with the countrate actually observed by chandra or xmm-_newton _ in the same energy range , taking into account all the associated uncertainties .    assuming that there are no calibration uncertainties , the chandra and/or xmm-_newton _ count rates that were predicted by analysing the rxte observation should be in perfect agreement with the actual count rates observed with these satellites . a systematic offset on the other hand ,",
    "would imply a discrepancy in the overall calibration of either or both detectors .",
    "it is evident that this method allows for the detection of a systematic uncertainty caused by the overall flux calibration of detectors and specifically in the determination of the normalization in a particular energy range .",
    "however , the method does not allow us to constrain any calibrational uncertainties in the determination of the spectral shape .",
    "we searched the archival rxte observations to find the best source that can be used for this purpose .",
    "an ideal source should be a frequent burster with a number of simultaneous observations and predictable burst properties .",
    "two low mass x - ray binaries in the archive conform to these conditions : the so - called clockwork burster gs  1826@xmath0238  and 4u  1636@xmath0536 .",
    "the problem with the latter source is that its bursts do not last long enough ( only about 20  s on average ) to obtain sufficient amount of data to infer any systematic trends during the cooling tails of x - ray bursts . on the other hand , with bursts that last on average 130  s ,",
    "gs  1826@xmath0238  provides a significant amount of counts to be used for this purpose .",
    "gs  1826@xmath0238   was first discovered with the ginga satellite ( makino et al .",
    "1988 ; tanaka   1989 ) .",
    "first conclusive detections of thermonuclear x - ray bursts from this source came from bepposax observations ( ubertini  et  al .",
    "1997 ) , although x - ray bursts may have been observed from this source earlier by oso  7 ( markert et al .  1977 ) and oso  8 ( becker et al .",
    "1976 ) . using 2.5 years of monitoring observations by bepposax , during which 70 x - ray bursts were detected , ubertini  et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported that the x - ray bursts show a quasi - periodicity of 5.76  hr , a remarkable characteristic of this source .",
    "later , using 260 x - ray bursts observed with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on board bepposax over 6 years , cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the burst recurrence time is indeed stable but decreases as the persistent flux increases .",
    "a total of 40 x - ray bursts were observed with the rxte between 1997 - 2003 ( galloway et al .",
    "2008 ) . during this time interval ,",
    "the persistent flux steadily increased as the burst recurrence time decreased ( galloway et al .",
    "another remarkable feature of the x - ray bursts observed from this source is their similarity . although the initial decay time - scale and the burst fluence show slight variations with persistent flux , the observed x - ray burst light curves are nearly identical and reproducible ( galloway et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the nearly identical light curves of individual bursts , predictable recurrence times , and , finally , already existing simultaneous observations with other x - ray satellites ( chandra and xmm- _ newton _ ) make gs  1826@xmath0238   an ideal target to understand and quantify the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of neutron - star masses and radii introduced by the uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration of rxte / pca .",
    "in this study , we use data from three different x - ray satellites .",
    "gs  1826@xmath0238  was observed simultaneously by chandra and rxte for the first time in 2002 , where three x - ray bursts were recorded .",
    "we present the analysis of these bursts below . furthermore , rxte observed the system in 2003 simultaneously with xmm-_newton_. during this observation , 7 x - ray bursts were detected with rxte .",
    "we analyze here 5 of these events because , during one of the remaining bursts , xmm-_newton _ was affected by high energy particle background ( burst # 28 ) while the other burst was only partially observed and did not have high time resolution data with rxte / pca ( burst # 29 ) .",

    "1st orders ) .",
    "the zeroth order data for this observation is saturated due to the high countrate of the source and the nominal frame time of 1.7  s.    even for the grating arms , pile - up was significant during the peak of the bursts . in order to correctly carry out the comparison between the rxte and chandra observations , we opt to correct for pile - up the _ predicted _ chandra countrates based on the rxte spectra , as opposed to correcting the observed chandra countrates .",
    "because rxte observations have better statistics , this forward folding of the correction does not unnecessarily inflate the uncertainties .",
    "we applied a pile - up correction procedure that is described in the appendix , which was developed based on the understanding of the detector properties and calibrated against independent data .",

    "3 .   in order to take into account the uncertainties in the rxte / pca modeling",
    ", we used the posterior likelihoods over the parameters for each spectral fit to calculate the uncertainty in the total predicted countrates .",
    "4 .   finally , we compared the observed chandra hetg / acis - s or xmm-_newton_/epic - pn countrates to the countrates predicted using the rxte / pca spectral fits . for this comparison , we binned the countrates to match the time resolution of each data set and subtracted the persistent flux level of the source from the burst emission . during the chandra observation , the nominal frame time was 1.7  s. the time resolution of the epic - pn observation was much higher .",
    "we , therefore , binned the epic - pn data to match the varying exposure time of rxte spectra .        in figures",
    "[ comp_ch ] , [ comp_xmm1 ] , and [ comp_xmm2 ] , we show the time evolution of the source countrate during each x - ray burst simultaneously observed with rxte and chandra in the 2.5@xmath08.0  kev range or with rxte and xmm-_newton _ in the 2.5@xmath010.0  kev range . in principle",
    ", all of the calculated ratios should be equal to unity within their formal uncertainties , if there are no systematic calibration differences .",
    "it is already evident from this figure that this is indeed the case between rxte and chandra but that there is a systematic calibration offset between rxte and xmm-_newton_.    to explore in more detail the calibration differences between the three instruments and whether such differences evolve with countrate , we performed two analyses .",
    "first , for the xmm-_newton_/epic - pn data , for which we infer the largest systematic calibration offset , we created histograms of the ratios of the predicted and observed countrates with varying start times compared to the burst start times ( see figure [ phtest2 ] ) .",
    "if there were a significant countrate dependence of the calibration offset , we would have seen a significant change in the distribution of calculated ratios at later stages of these bursts .",
    "however , it is evident from figure  [ phtest2 ] that there is no such time dependent change in the ratios .",
    "second , in order to quantify the level of offset between the three instruments , we followed the bayesian procedure described in papers i and ii and outlined below for completeness .",
    "we calculated the ratio @xmath14 between the observed and predicted countrates for each time bin in the 30@xmath0120  s interval after the start of every burst together with its formal uncertainty .",

    "this distribution is our model for the underlying systematic flux calibration offset between the instruments .",
    "if there are no calibration differences , the centroid should be equal to one , to within @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of measurements , and the dispersion should tend to zero .",
    "a significant offset in the flux calibration between two instruments will move @xmath25 away from unity , but keep the dispersion consistent with zero . on the other hand ,",
    "a large dispersion can not be produced by an overall flux calibration offset .",
    "instead , it likely points to effects such as an inadequate modeling of the pile - up correction , of the energy response of the detector(s ) , or of the astrophysical properties of the source .",

    "if the efficiencies of the detectors were constant in time , the results of this comparison would be applicable to all the bursts observed thoughout the durations of the missions .",
    "however , the responses of the detectors evolve with time for a number of reasons ( e.g. , gas leakage , charge transfer inefficiency ) . this evolution is typically accounted for using smooth , time - dependent models of the response parameters of the detectors .",
    "these parameters are determined by fitting the models to regular observations of the cosmic sources with known brightness and spectral shape or using internal calibrations sources ( e.g. epic cameras ) . as an example",

    "2013 ) throughout the mission .",
    "the smooth models of the evolution of the detector response clearly can not reliably capture the true evolution , which is expected to have a stochastic component .",

    "however , for many of the sources we used for neutron - star radius measurements in papers i and ii , the burst flux measurements were carried over many epochs spanning the lifetime of rxte . in this case , as we will show below , this potential calibration uncertainty should not be treated as a separate source of systematic uncertainty as it is already inherently part of the measured scatter of observed fluxes .    to demonstrate this point , we compute the mean and the variance of the ( burst ) flux measured by an instrument ( e.g. , rxte / pca ) . let the source flux for each burst be @xmath37 , with a mean of @xmath38 and an intrinsic dispersion @xmath39 .",

    "as we describe in the appendix , the effect of pileup is unlikely to change the value of this ratio in a statistically significant way .",
    "in contrast , we found a 14.0@xmath10.3% difference between the fluxes inferred using xmm-_newton_/epic - pn and rxte / pca .",

    "acis flux measurements are significantly higher than epic - pn , by 11.0@xmath10.5% .",
    "similarly , the difference in the flux measurements between the epic - pn and mos detectors has been noticed earlier ( see e.g. , mateos et al .",
    "2009 and xmm - newton calibration documents xmm - newton - soc - cal - tn-0018 and xmm - newton - soc - cal - tn-0052 ) ; mos yields fluxes that are approximately 7% higher than epic - pn ( see also read et al . 2014 ) .",
    "most recently , using 64 clusters of galaxies , schellenberger et al .",
    "( 2014 ) showed that the effective area cross - calibration uncertainty between acis and epic - pn is energy dependent and in the 2@xmath07  kev range stabilizes at a 15% level a similar result is also presented by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "given that the calibration errors of the detectors may be variable in time , it is possible that the excellent agreement between rxte and chandra is a coincidence .",
    "we showed , however , that even in this case , the spread of the measured burst fluxes reported in papers i and ii already accounts for this potential systematic uncertainty .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that , while an overall bias may still exist in the measurements , potential time - dependent flux calibration uncertainties do not increase the error budget of the radius measurements we reported in these earlier papers .",
    "one final consideration is whether the difference in the measured flux between xmm-_newton _ epic - pn and the other two instruments also affects the neutron star radii determined through the observations of quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the flux levels in question are very different in the observations of these dim sources : they are approximately six orders of magnitude below the peak burst fluxes and the crab nebula , and about three orders of magnitude below other typical calibration sources ( e.g. , clusters of galaxies ) . given the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra that is achieved with even the longest observations of quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries , it is not possible to discern any measured flux differences between instruments , even if this difference persisted at the 14% level .",
    "this supports the lack of evidence for flux differences presented in the earlier studies ( catuneanu et al .",
    "2013 ; heinke et al .",
    "2014 ; guillot et al .",
    "2013 ) , which compared neutron star radii derived from the quiescent sources using xmm-_newton _ and chandra data .",
    "to account for pileup in the chandra hetg / acis - s spectra , we used a correction that was developed independently by one of the co - authors , herman marshall , for mildly piled - up calibration data .",
    "the approach relies on the measurement of counts per pixel around the ir - m and si - k edges , at which the spectral response changes rapidly . denoting the observed counts per detector pixel per frame in wavelength bin @xmath60 as @xmath61",
    ", we define the degradation of the effective area as        the value of the parameter @xmath63 and the uncertainty associated with its determination was found using an observation of mk  421 ( observation i d 4148 ) performed on 26@xmath027 october 2002 with the letgs / acis - s for over 91  ks .",
    "the data were downloaded from _ tgcat _ ( huenemoerder et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the countrate spectra were rebinned by a factor of two so that each spectral bin corresponds closely to one acis pixel .",
    "the source was extremely bright so that there were of order 5000 counts per spectral bin in both the + 1 and -1 orders near 2  kev .",
    "the count spectrum was divided by the arf obtained from tgcat to generate spectra in photons/@xmath64/s /   for both the @xmath65 and @xmath66 orders . when the two orders are compared ( see the top panel of figure  [ final_overplot ] ) without being corrected for pileup , there are clear edges at ir - m ( 6.0   ) and si - k ( 6.74   ) in the effective - area - corrected spectra .",
    "these features arise from differential pileup , where @xmath61 may increase significantly over a few spectral resolution elements at an edge in the effective area of the instrument , causing increased pileup and a larger fractional loss of events with a corresponding decrease in apparent photon flux .",
    "we devised a model - independent method for estimating the parameter @xmath63 in equation  ( [ eqa1 ] ) , which depends on the very smooth and slowly varying photon spectrum of mk  421 . using the ratio of fluxes in the 5.5 - 5.9    range to those in the 6.1 - 6.5   range ( straddling the ir - m edge ) , we compute the value of @xmath63 that matches the ratios based on the average @xmath40 values in the two narrow bands .",
    "we find @xmath67 for @xmath66 and @xmath68 for @xmath65 and , therefore , adopt @xmath69 and a range of acceptable values that are @xmath70 away from this value .",
    "figure  [ final_overplot ] shows the sensitivity of the spectral inversion to @xmath63 ; for @xmath71 , the spectra still show edges , while , for @xmath72 , the data are over - corrected to form an excess over a smooth spectral model .",
    "( a global spectral fit to a double power law indicates that the photon spectrum should drop monotonically by only 1% per   through this wavelength range , so the assumption that the fluxes are equal should be good to 1% . )    using equation  ( [ eqa1 ] ) , which is verified to @xmath73 cts / frame / pixel , a @xmath74% uncertainty in @xmath63 results in at most a @xmath75% uncertainty in @xmath76 , which is smaller than the expected calibration uncertainty in @xmath77 .",
    "this method required the hrma effective area correction implemented in 2005 , which corrected the ir - m edge caused by a thin contaminant layer on the hrma .",
    "note that , the correction given in equation  ( [ eqa1 ] ) is valid for low to modest pileup , i.e. , @xmath78  cts / frame / pixel and the data used to compute the coefficient @xmath63 ranged up to about 0.10 cts / s / pixel .",
    "this yields a maximum correction of about 50% .    in our comparison between rxte and chandra",
    ", we took into account the pileup losses in the predicted countrates rather than correcting the observed rates for pileup . if we denote by @xmath79 the number of photons per detector pixel per frame that should have been recorded in wavelength bin @xmath60 in the absence of pileup , we can then invert the above expression to obtain                                      houck , j.  c. , & denicola , l.  a. 2000 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 216 , astronomical data analysis software and systems ix , ed .",
