    "analog network coding ( anc ) extends to multihop wireless networks the idea of linear network coding @xcite , where an intermediate node sends out a linear combination of its incoming packets . in a wireless network ,",
    "signals transmitted simultaneously by multiple sources add in the air .",
    "thus , each node receives at its input a _",
    "noisy sum _ of these signals , _",
    "i.e. _ a linear combination of the received signals and noise .",
    "a communication scheme wherein each relay node merely amplifies and forwards this noisy sum is referred to as analog network coding @xcite .",
    "the rates achievable with anc in layered relay networks is analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the achievable rate is computed under two assumptions : ( a ) each relay node scales the received signal to the maximum level possible subject to its transmit power constraint , ( b ) the nodes in all @xmath5 layers operate in the high - snr regime , where @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the received signal power at the @xmath9 node .",
    "it is shown that the rate achieved under these two assumptions asymptotically ( in source power ) approaches network capacity .",
    "the authors in @xcite extend this result to the scenarios where the nodes in at most one layer do not satisfy these assumptions and show that achievable rates in such scenarios still approach the network capacity as the source power increases .",
    "however , requiring each relay node to amplify its received signal to the upper bound of its transmit power constraint results in suboptimal performance of analog network coding in general , as we show in @xcite .",
    "further , even in low - snr regimes amplify - and - forward relaying can be capacity - achieving relay strategy in some communication scenarios , @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to analyze the performance of analog network coding in general layered networks , without the above two assumptions on input signal scaling factors and received snrs .    analyzing the performance of analog network coding without such assumptions however , results in a computationally intractable problem in general @xcite",
    "therefore , to compute the maximum achievable anc rate in general communication scenarios , in @xcite we establish a result that significantly reduces the computational complexity of this problem .",
    "further in @xcite , we propose a greedy scheme to bound from below the optimal rate achievable with analog network coding in general layered networks . for general layered relay networks ,",
    "these two results allow approximating the optimal anc rates within a constant gap from the cut - set upper bound asymptotically in the source power .",
    "these results not only allow us to exactly characterize the optimal anc rate in a class of symmetric layered networks that can not be addressed using existing approaches under the assumptions a and b , but allow us to do so in a computationally efficient manner .    in this paper",
    "we introduce another approach to reduce the computational complexity of approximating the maximum achievable anc rate in general layered networks .",
    "the proposed approach is based on the notion of _ network simplification _ , introduced in @xcite to characterize fraction of the capacity of the gaussian @xmath1-relay diamond network when only @xmath0 out of @xmath1 available relay nodes are used .",
    "previously , in _ cooperative communication _ literature as in @xcite , the notion of network simplification has been used in the amplify - and - forward relay networks to characterize the achievable rates . however , such prior work used network simplification in a restricted sense ( selecting the _ best _ single relay node among @xmath1 relays ) and considered simple network topologies ( the source communicating with the destination via a single relay node ) .",
    "in contrast , we provide the optimal anc rate characterization in much general communication scenarios where any number @xmath0 of relay nodes in a layer are used ( @xmath10 ) and the source communicates with the destination over any number @xmath5 of layers of relay nodes ( @xmath11 ) . in this sense , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to characterize the performance of network simplification in such general layered amplify - and - forward relay networks .",
    "we show that in the gaussian @xmath1-relay diamond network ( layered network with a single layer of relay nodes @xmath12 ) and a class of symmetric layered networks , the network simplification allows us to maintain achievable rates within small additive and multiplicative gaps of the maximum anc rate achievable when all relays in a layer are used . along with our previous results in @xcite , where we establish that analog network coding",
    "is a capacity achieving strategy in some communication scenarios , the results in this paper establish that in those scenarios using fewer nodes in each layer , we can still maintain achievable rates within small additive and multiplicative gaps to the capacity .",
    "further our results indicate that in general layered networks , the maximum achievable anc rate can be tightly approximated with much lower computational complexity than with existing schemes .",

    "computing the maximum end - to - end rate achievable with analog network coding in general layered relay networks is an important but computationally intractable problem .",
    "previously , this problem is addressed under certain assumptions on input signal factors and received snrs at the relay nodes . however , such assumptions lead to suboptimal end - to - end performance in general , and in certain communication scenarios it is desirable to compute the optimal rates without such assumptions .",
    "we introduce an approach based on the notion of _ network simplification _ to approximate the optimal anc rate within small additive and multiplicative gaps in the gaussian @xmath1-relay diamond network and a class of symmetric layered networks while simultaneously reducing the computational complexity of solving this problem .",
    "one of our main contributions is a result that states that in a layered network , each layer increases the additive gap between the optimal performance of analog network coding without and with network simplification by @xmath3 and similarly , the multiplicative gap by @xmath4 . to the best of our knowledge",
