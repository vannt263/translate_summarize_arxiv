    "the naked reissner - nordstrm ( r - n ) singularity is a classical general relativistic solution in electrovacuum . the solution is expected to have a very limited meaning , due to the fact that such singularities can not be created neither by a gravitational collapse , nor by dropping a charge into the black hole . ( according to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture general naked singularities should be prohibited in general theory of relativity , although there are indications that by including quantum effects the violations of the conjecture could be considered @xcite . ) moreover , a naked singularity created from some exotic initial data conditions should become quickly neutralized ( classically , or via quantum pair production ) .",
    "some results also indicate that if one considers electro - gravitational perturbations the r - n naked singularity becomes linearly unstable @xcite .",
    "however it was discovered that the scalar field scattering problem on such a singular background can be still well defined @xcite , since the waves remain regular at the origin .",
    "( however , the back reaction of the given scalar field configuration might still excite some of the unstable electro - gravitational modes and this would eventually lead to a breakdown of the perturbation approach . ) despite the nice regularity property of the scattering problem , the spacetime is non - globally hyperbolic and the time evolution of the fields is not unique @xcite .",
    "this means one has to specify an additional boundary condition at the singularity to obtain a fully unique time evolution .",
    "another way of seeing the problem is through the language of operators : one can understand the spatial part of the wave operator as a positive symmetric operator acting on a @xmath4 hilbert space , and then obtain the scalar field dynamics through a suitable positive self - adjoint extension of such a symmetric operator @xcite .",
    "( one `` preferred '' way in which such a self - adjoint extension can be always realized is through the so called friedrich s extension @xcite , which will also be the case of this paper . ) anyway , after uniquely specifying the dynamics , one should be able to characterize the scattering by a set of characteristic oscillations , the quasi - normal modes .",
    "low damped quasi - normal modes are in general used as a possible source of information about potential astrophysical objects ( such as neutron stars , black holes ) , and the highly damped modes are potentially interesting from the point of view of quantum gravity @xcite . since a lot of work was devoted to the problem of quasinormal modes of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , it might be interesting to observe what happens if one transits from the r - n black hole case to the r - n naked singularity case ( with a reflective boundary condition ) .",
    "information about `` what happens '' shows how many features of the quasinormal modes of the black hole spacetimes are specific to the black holes themselves and what features survive much more general conditions .",
    "let us also give one concrete example why asking what happens with the quasinormal modes of the naked r - n singularity might be interesting : in the black hole case the behavior of the asymptotically highly damped modes is widely suspected to be linked to the properties of the black hole spacetime horizon(s ) , ( or more specifically it is considered to carry information about _ quantum _ black holes ) .",
    "what does then happen with the asymptotically highly damped modes in case there are _ no _ horizons present ?",
    "( if the behavior of the highly damped modes in case of r - n naked singularity would , for instance , resemble the behavior of the highly damped modes of the black hole , it would be a disturbing fact from the point of view of the popular conjectures linking the modes to the horizon s quantum area spacing .",
    "moreover , investigating the r - n naked singularity from this point of view is especially attractive , as the r - n naked singularity is obtained by a continuous transition in the @xmath5 parameters from the r - n black hole spacetime . )",
    "thus , briefly , we hope that despite the fact that most likely the r - n naked singularity model does not correspond to a realistic physical situation , there are still many interesting things one can learn from such a model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the second section we analyse the problem of the uniqueness of the time evolution of scalar fields on a r - n naked singularity background . in the sections",
    "three and four we analyse the properties of the effective potential for the scalar fields scattering and the geometrical optics ( eikonal ) limit of such a scattering problem . in the fifth section",
    "we define analytically solvable potentials that can give good approximations to the problem of the low damped qnm frequencies ( such that characterize the given scattering problem ) . in the sixth section we use those analytical approximations to derive semi - analytical results for the qnm frequencies in the eikonal limit . in the seventh section we use the numerical characteristic integration to obtain the low damped frequencies for the low values of @xmath3 . in the eighth section we analyse what happens with",
    "the asymptotically highly damped modes and we suggest that in case of naked r - n singularity such modes do _ not _ exist ( as one might expect considering some presently popular conjectures @xcite ) .",
    "we give the final conclusions in the section nine .",
    "we provide also appendices with more detailed results and some further suggestions for the analytical approximations of the problem .",
    "in this section we will follow the standard analysis of the scalar field evolution in a curved background .",
    "( as an example of such an analysis see the treatment of schwarzschild black hole perturbations in @xcite . for a review that presents also such techniques",
    "see for example @xcite . )",

    "if there exists only one solution of the equation , such that it is linearly independent from the solution bounded at infinity and in the same time it is bounded at @xmath25 then these two solutions uniquely define the green s function .",
    "if all the solutions of are singular at 0 , there is no solution ( bounded in @xmath21 ) of the given initial value problem such that it can be laplace transformed ( this can be taken as an indication that there is no solution at all ) .",
    "if both of the linearly independent solutions are regular at 0 , and ( at least ) two different green functions lead to a function in the domain of the inverse laplace transform , then there is no _ uniquely _ defined solution to the initial value problem . in the `` worst '' case",
    "there are infinitely many solutions , given by arbitrary linear combination of @xmath22 , that are linearly independent to the solution bounded at @xmath24 .",

    "unfortunately for the case of r - n naked singularity ( @xmath27 ,   @xmath28 ) both of the linearly independent solutions @xmath22 are regular at 0 and the problem is underdetermined .",
    "it is easy to show that both of the solutions are regular at the origin .",

    "the fact that the problem is underdetermined is not surprising , since the space - time is _ not _ globally hyperbolic and anything can fall out at any time from the singularity .",
    "this means the singularity has `` hair '' ( carries some other information beyond the metric ) and the quasi - normal modes obviously depend on the  hair \" . let us add here that , as we already mentioned in the introduction , the `` hair '' of the singularity relates to the existence of many different self - adjoint extensions of the `` hamiltonian '' operator in the equation .",
    "( in @xcite one can find a nice analysis of the uniqueness of the self - adjoint extensions of such operators for many different types of naked spacetime singularities including the r - n naked singularity . )",
    "is there any intuitive physical condition that we can further impose on the fields , that will uniquely select the appropriate green s function ?",
    "at least to get the geometrical optics continuous extension of the black hole case one can impose the condition that nothing falls in or out of the singularity .",
    "this means there is neither absorption nor superradiation in the scattering and the s - matrix of the k - g field is a unitary operator .",
    "what does this condition mean ?",

    "( one might argue that it will be enough to claim that the fields and their first @xmath21 derivatives should be real at zero , but that does not put any general constraint on the normal modes . )",

    "this translates to @xmath58=0.\\ ] ] but since both @xmath59 ( see ) and fourier - like transform given by should not map non - zero functions to zero , one obtains the condition @xmath60 .",
    "this means we compose the relevant wave packet only from the following modes : @xmath61 the same line of reasoning applies to the condition @xmath56 and the wave - packets that fulfill such condition must be composed entirely from modes given as ( @xmath62 ) : @xmath63 for @xmath64 , we have the coefficient @xmath65 and the solution @xmath66 behaves as a constant for @xmath67 ( with the value set to 1 ) , which means that the condition does not make strictly sense ; in such case the modes are given simply by the function @xmath66 .",
    "this shows that the condition of s - matrix being a unitary operator gives additional constraints on the green s function .",
    "the previous conditions mean that we shall consider only a linear space of wave - packets formed purely from modes that vanish at zero , or a linear space of wave - packets formed purely from modes whose first @xmath21 derivatives vanish at zero .",
    "( of course one can not superpose wave - packets formed from modes having the vanishing radial derivative at 0 with wave packets formed from modes that are vanishing at 0 , since the 4-current does not linearly depend on a wave - function . )",
    "so let us pick one of those two types of modes , fix the particular green s function and employ the following reasoning : since @xmath68 is conserved and the coefficients in the equation are everywhere outside 0 a smooth function of @xmath21 , the function @xmath69 , arising from compactly supported initial data could be unbounded in time only in the case the wave - packet becomes concentrated around the singularity and slowly growing asymptotically with time into delta function @xmath70 but this scenario is prevented by the boundary condition that `` nothing flows in or out of the singularity at any time '' .",
    "this means we expect the solution to be bounded with respect to both time and space and all the reasoning based on the assumption of the existence of laplace transform is justified .",
    "further in the text we will employ the field vanishing condition at 0 .",
    "( this boundary condition at the singularity corresponds to what is known as friedrich s extension of a symmetric operator . )",
    "thus the quasinormal modes will relate to the scattering problem following from the time evolution determined by the boundary condition @xmath71 . but everything that we will do in the following text can be repeated for any other meaningful normal modes boundary condition giving another time evolution of the fields . the general dependence of the quasi - normal modes ( characteristic oscillations ) on such a boundary condition ( given by some linear combination @xmath72 ) describes the way the quasi - normal modes depend on the  hair \" of the singularity . since the quasi - normal modes are the ones that carry astrophysical information about the astrophysical sources , their dependence on the  hair \" of the singularity ( in some simplifying sense given by the complex parameter @xmath73 ) has a potential astrophysical importance ( of course in case naked singularities have any astrophysical importance ) .",

    "first let us have a look at the geometrical optics ( eikonal ) limit of the klein - gordon equation , which is valid for @xmath97 .",
    "in particular what does the geometrical optics limit tell us about the fundamental mode ?",

    "below : the same , but this time for @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "there is no secondary peak in this case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from the black hole qnm - s boundary conditions one can see that such massless particles decaying from their unstable orbit and eventually escaping either to the b - h horizon , or the infinity represent the fundamental qnm - s in the @xmath97 ( geometrical ) limit",
    ". one can observe ( see the discussion later ) that the same holds in the naked singularity case . in the @xmath97 case the fundamental mode of the massless perturbations",
    "is described by the picture of a particle decaying from its unstable `` photon '' orbit .",
    "( note that in the naked singularity case the stable photon orbit makes the particle decaying inwards oscillate around the stable orbit . )",
    "this should suggest that in the geometrical optics limit    1 .",
    "one shall expect continuity of the fundamental mode ( as a function of @xmath127 ) when turning from the black hole to the naked singularity case , 2 .   for @xmath128",
    "there is a clear indication that there do not exist low damped quasi - normal modes .",
    "the way how to understand the continuity ( for @xmath97 ) of the fundamental mode as one transfers from the black hole case to the naked singularity case could be the following : consider the partial s - matrix @xmath129 . within",
    "the s - matrix one can look for poles on the complex plane : obviously any of the poles must be necessarily non - real . for the relativistic time dependence convention chosen as  @xmath130   the poles with @xmath131 must be purely imaginary ( as a result of the given hamiltonian being a symmetric operator ) and they represent bound states with the non - relativistic energies given as @xmath132 .",
    "the poles with @xmath133 represent quasinormal frequencies .",
    "some of the quasinormal frequencies correspond to the resonances in the phase factor related to the partial s - matrix , and the wave packets formed out of the resonance energies represent quantum particles tunnelling out of the potential valley ; for the non - relativistic quantum particles ( for example ) with the decay rate given as @xmath134 . now in the naked singularity case the fundamental mode is represented by a resonance that has a low enough energy ( at the level of the smaller peak ) and gets trapped in the potential valley in between the peaks for some time and then radiated away .",
    "the larger peak behind the smaller peak is hugely dominant ( large @xmath3 ) and effectively acts to the wave packet as an infinite barrier .",
    "there are probably much higher resonance energies related to higher qnm frequency overtones that are determined by the higher peak , but left unaffected by the details of the small peak .",
    "so there are two different effective regimes for the quasinormal modes , in the first regime they are sensitive only to the details of the smaller peak , in the second regime they are sensitive only to the details of the larger peak .",
    "this splitting disappears in the case of small @xmath3-s since the two peaks are of comparable heights and effectively interfere .",
    "let us finish this section with one more remark : in the black hole case one can relate the fundamental mode to the peak of the potential ( independently of @xmath97 ) following the way of thinking in @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves @xmath135 is for quasinormal modes 1 .",
    "the same happens for real @xmath136-s , when the energies @xmath137 are close ( `` almost at '' ) to the peak of the potential .",
    "so for `` almost '' real @xmath137 ( fundamental mode ) the continuity of the ratio of reflected and transmitted amplitudes analytically continued to the complex plane suggests that the real part of the frequency should be near the square root of the peak of the potential .",
    "( this intuition is then to some extend confirmed also semi - analytically , such as by the ferrari and mashhoon approach using the poeschl - teller potential @xcite , or by using the inverted harmonic oscillator potential . ) in the case of a naked singularity life is not so easy ( in the reduced 1d problem we have no transmitted amplitudes ) , so this simple logic fails .",
    "( one can say luckily it fails as if it remained valid one would also for @xmath97 expect a discontinuity in the fundamental mode as one jumps from the black hole to the naked singularity .",
    "this is because the second , dominant peak suddenly appears in the domain of the @xmath76 coordinate , due to the fact that the domain of @xmath76 discontinuously jumps when passing from the black hole to the naked singularity case . )",
    "certainly one can say that any of the quick fits , such as were done in the black hole case do not lead to anything close to the numerical data obtained in this paper .",
    "in this section we want to suggest some ways to model the naked singularity scattering ( with a general time evolution ) by solutions of the equation with @xmath138 replaced by analytically solvable potentials .",
    "the reasons are the following : first , this section serves as a basis for the analysis of the  @xmath97   cases provided in the section [ largelsection ] .",
    "second , it demonstrates that the naked singularity scattering is _ in principle _ treatable via analytical approximations and thus shows the general power of analytical techniques .",
    "( also the approximations obtained here might produce some future results for the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "for some further calculations see the appendix [ a ] .",
    "furthermore , for a very nice overview of the results for the quasi - normal frequencies and related transmission resonances of the analytically tractable potentials see @xcite . )",
    "third , it might bring more insights into the physics obtained through the exact scalar field potential .",
    "the key point is to split the scalar field potential into different domains and approximate it on each of those domains ( or directly the solution of the equation ) by a different , analytically solvable potential .",
    "then one has to impose the standard procedure : the logarithmic derivatives of the solutions on different domains must be glued on the domain s boundary .",
    "we might add here that since the analytically solvable potentials are typically fitted by the parameters of the peaks one expects such approximation to work for the modes that are _ not _ too damped ( the _ low _ damped qnm modes ) .",
    "the approximation _ can not _ be taken too seriously for the _ highly _ damped modes .",
    "let us suggest modeling all the solutions of the relevant cases as follows :      for this case it might be interesting to consider the morse potential .",
    "( for the definition and origins of all the potentials used in this section see also @xcite . ) on the other hand the infinite valley behind the one and only peak may not be well modelled by only a finite valley that is behind the peak of the morse potential .",
    "thus we consider the solution in the region ` behind' morse potential region to be given as for @xmath139 and the logarithmic derivative gluing condition originates from :    1 .",
    "@xmath140  : use function given as ( for the details see equation ): @xmath141 2 .",
    "@xmath142  : use the appropriate solution of the equation with the morse potential : @xmath143    here @xmath144 is a point most conveniently chosen where the morse potential is 0 ( for any arbitrary @xmath3 there is such point for @xmath145 ) .",
    "this means @xmath144 can be analytically given as @xmath146 let us make here one remark : instead of approximating the original scalar field equation for @xmath67 one can consider taking the equation in the @xmath25 approximation .",
    "this leads to the following : @xmath147 the equation has solutions @xmath148 .",
    "the solution such that fulfills @xmath149 must have @xmath150 .",
    "this approximation of the solution we think to be less exact as the approximation given as , as it is in fact effectively only the first non - zero term of the power series expansion of taken at 0 .",
    "( for such reasons we decided to use in our analytical approximations the approximate solution . )",
    "let us consider now the limit of large @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", since the peak already lies close to 0 and the change in the highest power of inverted @xmath76 becomes more and more dominant ( with higher @xmath3-s ) , one might simplify the approximation given in case [ one ] , by using the following potential :    1 .",

    "the expense of the simplicity is that the approximation by such potential might be slightly less exact than by using the morse potential , but one still expects it to be accurate enough .",
    "if one does not want to neglect the second smaller peak ( so one is interested in resonances related to the valley between the two peaks ) , the analytically treatable potential describing all the resonances ( and also higher damped qnm frequencies ) could be :    1 .",
