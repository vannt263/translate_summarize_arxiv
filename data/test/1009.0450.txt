    "we have extended the search of @xcite for periodicities in the intensities of x - ray sources using light curves produced by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed data accumulated during the first 8.5 years of the mission and detected 41 periodicities and 5 possible periodicities or quasiperiodicities .",
    "two of the periodicities detected in their search likely represent neutron star spin and @xmath1 represent the precession of tilted accretion disks or other phenomena that produce superorbital periods .",
    "the 33 other periodicities are believed to represent evidence of the orbital motion of a close - binary star system .",
    "most of the orbital periods were associated with high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) where the normal type star is either a supergiant or a be star .",
    "eight of the periodicities were associated with the orbital periods of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and one was associated with a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "the search of @xcite was one of the most comprehensive searches for periodicities in the range of hours to years in the x - ray intensities of the bright galactic x - ray sources .",
    "however , relatively few new periods were found in the course of the search in spite of the conventional wisdom that nearly all of the bright galactic sources are accreting binaries with periods in the range of sensitivity of the search .",
    "the orbital periods of many galactic sources are still not determined , and so searches for evidence of these presently unknown orbital periods remain of interest .",
    "the present search improves on the sensitivity achieved in the earlier search through the analysis of light curves obtained over a longer course of time , i.e. nearly 14 years as opposed to 8.5 years , and through two major changes in the analysis techniques .",
    "we have also analyzed subintervals of the mission - long data sets .",
    "a preliminary report of the results of this work was presented in @xcite .",
    "the asm consists of three scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) mounted on a rotating drive assembly @xcite .",
    "each ssc acts as a coded - aperture camera and comprises a position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) that detects x - ray photons and provides one - dimension position information via the charge - division technique .",
    "the entrance window of each pspc has a total geometric area of about 68 @xmath2 .",
    "a mask that is perforated with a pseudorandom pattern of open slits is held 30 cm above the pspc entrance window .",
    "the mask open fraction is close to 50% .",
    "the field of view of each ssc is @xmath3 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the asm observations have almost entirely been made as series of 90-s exposures known as dwells . in each",
    "dwell the aspect of the assembly of sscs is held fixed . for each exposure , a coded - aperture analysis of the data from each ssc yields intensity estimates of the sources that are listed in a catalog ( hereafter the asm catalog ) and that fall within that ssc s field of view .",
    "the intensity estimates are derived for each of four spectral bands which nominally correspond to photon energy ranges of 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 , 5 - 12 , and 1.5 - 12 kev and typically achieve a sensitivity of a few ssc counts s@xmath4 ( the crab nebula produces intensities of 27 , 23 , 25 , and 75 ssc counts s@xmath4 in the 4 bands , respectively ) .",
    "any given source has been viewed in a large number , e.g. , 30,000 to 100,000 , of the 90-s exposures over the @xmath0 years of operation of the asm .",
    "each exposure generally yields intensity estimates for the four spectral bands .",
    "the present search has been carried out , except where otherwise noted , using the asm data acquired from the beginning of operations in early 1996 through 2010 january 28 ( mjd 55224 ; modified julian date = julian date @xmath5 2,400,000.5 ) .",
    "the coded - aperture analysis is applied to all asm observations .",
    "the results are sorted source - by - source , filtered , and used to construct light curve files for each of 571 potential sources for each of the four energy bands .",
    "the intensity measurements contained in these files are the input data for the present periodicity search .",
    "the instrument properties have changed over the 14 years of operation in orbit because of at least three effects .",
    "first , the gain of ssc 1 ( of sscs 1 - 3 ) increased at about 10% per year for the first 13 years or so because of a leak in the counter entrance window ( the rate of increase appears to have moderated in year 14 ) .",
    "this has resulted , first , in progressive reductions in the effective sensitivity of ssc 1 in the 5 - 12 kev band and , recently , to some extent in the 3 - 5 kev band because in the last few years the pulse heights of higher energy events are often saturated and thus unusable .",
    "the second of the effects is present because the one - dimensional position - sensing capability of the proportional counters is based on the charge - division technique and the resistivity of carbon - coated quartz - fiber anodes . the process of event detection in the counters results in the redistribution or removal of the carbon .",
    "the resistivity of each anode thus evolves over time generally becoming larger and less uniform , and so the functions that relate charge ratio to position have changed over the course of the mission .",
    "third , in the last few years there is often a high background of events that have pulse heights that suggest that they are due to the detection of al k@xmath6 photons .",
    "we do not understand in detail why this is happening but we speculate that it may be due to leakage of ultraviolet radiation through the al - coated kapton thermal shields that are immediately above the coded mask plates .",
    "uv radiation would produce photoelectrons at the counter body surfaces that happen to be , by design of the instrument , at potentials of approximately @xmath7 kv .",
    "the photoelectrons would be accelerated toward and would hit , e.g. , the aluminum collimators that are near the ground potential . some fraction of the al k@xmath6 photons that would be produced by this process would then be detected .    both the gain changes and charge ratio to position calibration changes are accounted for in detail in the detector model used in our coded - aperture analysis .",
    "however , the calibrations are imperfect and the derived source intensities are therefore somewhat affected by systematic errors on both short and long time scales .",
    "the coded aperture analysis is also designed to eliminate the effects of backgrounds that are smooth and slowly - varying with regard to position in the detector ; this is largely but not entirely effective .",
    "searches for periodicities where large numbers of measurements are involved have generally proceeded by averaging the measured intensities in equally - spaced time bins , fourier transforming the resulting time series , producing a power density spectrum by taking the absolute square of the complex amplitude for each frequency , and searching for peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "our search largely follows this outline but we have implemented a few significant modifications as described below . in some searches for periodicities , a lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ;",
    "see also @xcite ) is used in place of a fourier transform , but , when large numbers of measurements and time bins are being analyzed , the differences between the two are not important except at extremely low frequencies . for the present analyses ,",
    "the conventional discrete fourier transform is adequate so we do not make use of the lomb - scargle variation .",
    "we employ two unusual strategies with the goal of improving the search sensitivity .",
    "the first strategy involves the use of weights such as the reciprocals of the variances in fourier and other types of analysis since the individual asm measurements have a wide range of associated uncertainties . since in the present instance the amplitudes in the fourier transforms may be regarded as statistical averages , they may be better determined by the use of appropriate weights .",
    "this is discussed briefly in @xcite and at greater length in @xcite .",
    "these two reports also discuss the use of weights which involve the intrinsic source variability , but we do not use such weights in the work reported herein .",
    "the second strategy stems from the fact that the observations of the source are obtained with a low duty cycle , i.e. , the window function is sparse but nevertheless highly structured .",
    "the properties of the window function , in combination with the presence of slow variations of the source intensity , act to hinder the detection of variations on short time scales .",
    "the window function power density spectrum ( pds ) has substantial power at high frequencies , e.g. , 1 cycle d@xmath4 and 1 cycle per spacecraft orbit ( @xmath8 minute period ) .",
    "since the data may be regarded as the product of a ( hypothetical ) continuous set of source intensity measurements with the window function , a fourier transform of the data is equivalent to the convolution of a transform of a continuous set of intensity measurements with the window function transform .",
    "the high frequency structure in the window function transform acts to spread power at low frequencies in the source intensity to high frequencies in the calculated transform ( or , equivalently , the pds ) .",
    "this effectively raises the noise level at high frequencies .",
    "thus , in most of our analyses , a smoothed version of the light curve is subtracted from the binned data prior to the fourier analysis .",
    "the details of the analysis of each asm dwell - by - dwell light curve are as follows .",
    "the time of each intensity measurement was adjusted to approximately remove the effects of the motion of the earth around the solar system barycenter and the adjusted times were used to assign the measurements to equally - spaced time bins of duration 5 minutes ( 0.0034722 d ) or more .",
    "weights are used in averaging those measurements that fall into a given time bin .",
    "the @xmath9 measurements that fall into the time bin which is labelled by the index @xmath10 are denoted with index @xmath11 that runs from 1 to @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the @xmath11th measured source intensity in a time bin by @xmath12 and its associated 1-sigma uncertainty by @xmath13 .",
    "the averaging in this stage uses weights @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a selected weighting index ( see values in table  [ tbl : mthds ] ) .",
    "the weighted - average intensity in bin @xmath10 is then @xmath16 for convenience we denote the denominator of this expression by @xmath17 so that @xmath18 where it should be understood that @xmath19 for those time bins that contain no measurements .",
    "the @xmath17 s are used to weight the time bins in the subsequent analysis .",

    "the smoothed version is given by a time bin by time bin ratio in which the numerator is computed by convolving a kernel function with a weighted version of the binned light curve .",
    "the denominator is computed by convolving the same kernel function with a weighted version of the window function .",
    "the value of the @xmath10th bin of the smoothed data is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the kernel function , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the above defined functions of the time bin index @xmath10 , and `` @xmath24 '' denotes convolution",
    ". the kernel function @xmath21 may be either a gaussian or a box function .",
    "in the case of the gaussian kernel , the full width at half maximum response is taken to be equal to the smoothing time parameter .",
    "the gaussian is calculated out to @xmath25 standard deviations from its center . in the case of the box function ,",
    "the box width is taken to be twice the smoothing time parameter .",
    "the convolution is accomplished using fourier transforms .",
    "we repeated the analyses using seven different values of the smoothing time parameter ( see table  [ tbl : tmscls ] ) to optimize the sensitivity in each of several different frequency ranges . in each case",
    "the smoothed light curve was subtracted from the unsmoothed light curve , weights were applied , and the results were fourier transformed . in symbols , this part of the analysis produces a filtered light curve described by : @xmath26 where the weights @xmath27 are given by @xmath28^{k_b / k_a}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 is a second weighting index .",
    "weight index values are given in table  [ tbl : mthds ] .",
    "we also did the analysis without subtracting a smoothed version of the light curve .",
    "the unweighted average of the set of @xmath30 s which correspond to bins with nonzero exposure is computed and then subtracted from each of the @xmath30 values for those bins . the resultant array is extended with zeroes by a factor of four and fourier transformed .",
    "the extension of the array yields oversampling in the frequency domain .",
    "the oversampled transform is converted into a power density spectrum which is normalized to have an average value of unity .",
    "the normalized power spectra are compressed by saving the average and maximum values for sets of contiguous frequency bins ; the number of contiguous bins depends on the frequency range and smoothing time parameter ( see table  [ tbl : tmscls ] ) .",
    "we found that for the analyses where short smoothing time scales were used , i.e. , time scales of 0.3 , 0.9 , and 3.0 days , the compressed power spectra have a non - white appearance .",
    "the effect is strongest for the shortest smoothing time scale , i.e. , 0.3 days .",
    "it is not clear how to apply a threshold for detection of a periodicity in a nonwhite spectrum .",
    "therefore we added a procedure ( to the code that performs the compression described above ) to compute a `` background '' average power around each compressed frequency bin , and to then obtain whitened maximum values .",
    "each whitened maximum value is then the ratio of a maximum value in an unwhitened compressed spectrum to the corresponding background average .",
    "the resulting whitened spectra generally appear to have little systematic structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : whiten ] ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : mthds ] lists , at the highest level , the variations of the analysis method that we have used .",
    "we found that the results from the methods where both weighting and filtering were applied ( `` wtgs '' , `` wtgs - v4 '' , `` wtgs - v8 '' , and `` wtbx '' ) were almost always nearly equal or superior to the results obtained with the other methods ( `` unwt '' , `` wt '' , `` ungs '' ) . a typical , i.e. ,",
    "not the extreme best case , of the differences is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pdscalc ] .",
    "therefore we did not search for significant peaks in the power spectra obtained using the latter methods .",
    "the `` wtgs '' , `` wtgs - v4 '' , `` wtgs - v8 '' , and `` wtbx '' methods were all applied to the 1.5 - 12 kev band light curves , but the results generally produced power spectra that were quite similar in terms of both detailed appearance and sensitivity .",
    "therefore only the `` wtgs '' method was applied to the other three energy bands .",
    "the results from the four energy bands are , in some cases , quite different from each other .",

    "we make the assumption that the powers in the whitened spectra computed as described above similarly follow an exponential distribution . in the present case",
    "it is not clear how to precisely compute the number of independent bins that we examined because 1 ) some of the power spectra for a given source involve the same data and differ only on account of slight variations in the analysis procedure , and 2 ) there is a significant degree of dependence among the powers in an oversampled power spectrum .",
    "although it is not fully justified on an a priori basis , we simply estimate the number of independent bins @xmath31 by the product of the number of frequency bins that would have applied if the fourier spectrum had not been oversampled , the number of energy bands analyzed ( 4 ; this neglects the non - independent bins among the four slightly different analyses of the 1.5 - 12 kev band ) , and the number of sources ( 571 ) .",
    "the neglect of the oversampling factor and the multiple similar analyses of the sum band does not appear to have led to significant underestimates of the detection thresholds , and , thus , this procedure appears to be justified .",
    "we have chosen a detection threshold @xmath32 for previously unknown periodicities to limit the expected number of false detections @xmath33 produced by statistical fluctuations ( based on the assumption that the powers are exponentially distributed ) in the power spectra calculated using a given smoothing time parameter .",
    "thus we have @xmath34 so that @xmath35 the values of @xmath32 are given in table  [ tbl : tmscls ] for @xmath36 .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : whiten ] and [ fig : pdscalc ] , the window functions of the light curves often contain strong peaks at or close to particular frequencies .",
    "even though the analysis procedure tends to minimize the appearance of these frequencies in the whitened power spectra , there are occurrences of peaks at these frequencies . in the analyses done with filtering based on smoothing time scales of 10.0 days and under , we ignore all peaks in the frequency ranges @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 d@xmath4 .",
    "for the other analyses , we ignore all peaks in the frequency ranges @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 d@xmath4 .",
    "a substantial fraction of the 571 potential sources are extragalactic targets such as active galactic nuclei , extended galactic targets such as supernova remnants , or x - ray binaries that have been in quiescence since the beginning of the rxte mission and for which we have no expectation of finding detectable periodicities .",
    "the power spectra of these sources act effectively as controls that show the actual statistics of the power spectra and that bring attention to periodicities that must be the product of statistical fluctuations or artifacts .",
    "indeed , the search procedure described here was tailored in part by examination of the results on the `` controls '' .",
    "furthermore , since it would be difficult to understand the reality of peaks that exceed the detection threshold in the power spectra of these sources , the effective number of sources must be less than 571 .",
    "we have not adjusted the significance thresholds downward to account for this effect .    since we searched large numbers of bins , the thresholds for the detection of previously unreported periodicities given in table  [ tbl : tmscls ]",
    "when a periodicity has previously been reported , it may be confirmed even if the power at or very close to the previously reported frequency is below the threshold given in the table .",
    "uncompressed power density spectra are useful for precise estimation of the frequencies of the detected periodicities .",
    "since the uncompressed spectra were not saved in the original analysis for smoothing time scales less than or equal to 30.0 days , the analyses that produced the most significant detection of each periodicity were repeated , if necessary , and the resulting uncompressed spectra were saved . for each periodicity",
    "a small frequency range around the major peak was fit with a gaussian to obtain estimates of the central frequency , its uncertainty , and the peak width .",
    "the uncertainty in the frequency may be estimated based on the result of horne and baliunas ( 1986 ) that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the length of the time interval covered by the light curve and @xmath53 is the peak power in a normalized pds .",
    "we also use the simple estimate @xmath54 which , in most cases , should be a conservative upper limit to the uncertainty ( but , if the periodicity persisted for only a fraction of the time covered by the light curve , the uncertainty could be larger than this value ) . in the estimates of frequencies and periods that we present below ,",

    "( 8) is given first and the uncertainty derived using eq .",
    "( 9 ) is given second in square brackets .",
    "in the present search we find clear evidence of the periodicities in gro j1008@xmath557 and ss 433 that have been previously detected in the asm data but had not been detected in the analysis reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of the 9.56-day period of 4u 2206 + 543 , but did not find evidence of variation with a period of @xmath55 days .",
    "such variation was first reported by @xcite .",
    "since we now find clear evidence of variation at the @xmath55-d period , we report its detection herein .    in the previous section",
    ", we noted that periodicities at previously identified frequencies can be found with better sensitivity than periodicities at undetermined frequencies .",
    "therefore we examined the power spectra for peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the periods listed in the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite and thereby identified evidence of the presence of a number of periodicities that were not found by @xcite .",
