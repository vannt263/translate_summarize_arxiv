    "quantum two level systems ( qubits ) strongly coupled to mechanical resonators can function as hybrid quantum systems with several potential applications in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "the physics of these systems can be well described with the tools of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) , in which an atom is strongly coupled to photons in an electromagnetic cavity .",
    "such qubit - mechanical mode interactions are key ingredients for quantum logic with ion traps @xcite , and have been used to generate non - classical states of a mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , phonons or mechanical vibrations couple to a wide variety of well - studied quantum systems , and are therefore , considered a promising means to coherently interface qubits across disparate energy scales @xcite . in the context of solid state emitters ,",
    "mechanical hybrid systems were first proposed @xcite , and subsequently demonstrated @xcite with the electronic states of quantum dots .",
    "such a mechanical hybrid quantum system with negatively charged nitrogen vacancy ( nv(- ) , hereafter referred to as nv ) centers in diamond , in particular , would benefit from their long spin coherence times @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that in the strong spin - phonon coupling regime , phonons can be used to mediate quantum state transfer , and generate effective interactions between nv spins @xcite .",
    "strong coupling of an nv spin ensemble to a mechanical resonator can also be used to generate squeezed spin states @xcite , which can enable high sensitivity magnetometry @xcite .",
    "seminal experiments on coupling nv spins to mechanical oscillators relied on magnetic field gradients @xcite .",
    "more recently , owing to the development of single crystal diamond nanofabrication techniques @xcite , the effect of lattice strain on the nv ground state spin sublevels has been exploited to couple nvs to mechanical modes of diamond cantilevers @xcite , and bulk acoustic wave resonators fabricated on diamond @xcite .",
    "strain - mediated coupling is experimentally elegant since its origin is intrinsic to a monolithic device , and it does not involve functionalization of mechanical resonators , or precise and stable positioning of magnetic tips very close to a diamond chip",
    ". however , current demonstrations are far from the strong coupling regime due to the small spin - phonon coupling strength provided by strain from relatively large mechanical resonators . in this work",
    ", we present an important step towards strong coupling by incorporating photostable nvs in a diamond cantilever with nanoscale transverse dimensions , and demonstrate a single phonon coupling rate of @xmath1 hz from dispersive interaction of nv spins with the resonator .",
    "this is a @xmath2 improvement over existing nv - strain coupling demonstrations . in our experiments ,",
    "we first detect the effect of driven cantilever motion on nvs as a broadening of their electron spin resonance ( esr ) signal , and through follow - up measurements , establish this to be strain - mediated coupling to the mechanical mode of interest .",
    "subsequently , we use spin echo to probe the temporal dynamics of nvs in the cantilever , and precisely measure the spin - phonon coupling rate . in the conclusion , we discuss subsequent device engineering options to further improve this coupling strength by @xmath3 , and reach the strong coupling regime .",
    "in analogy with atom - photon interactions in cqed , the key requirement for applications that rely on strong qubit - phonon coupling is that the co - operativity of the interaction exceed unity @xcite    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is the single phonon coupling rate , @xmath6 is the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical mode of interest , @xmath7 is the intrinsic mechanical damping rate , and @xmath8 is the qubit dephasing rate . for strain - mediated linear coupling , the single phonon coupling rate",
    "is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the strain due to zero point motion , and @xmath11 is the strain susceptibility , an intrinsic property of the qubit . the spin triplet ground state of the nv has a relatively small @xmath12 ghz / strain @xcite , since the three spin sublevels share the same orbital wavefunction .",
    "the effect of strain on these levels is proposed to be a filtered down effect from stronger perturbations to the orbitals themselves , particularly from spin - orbit coupling to the excited state @xcite , and a change in spin - spin interaction energy in the deformed ground state orbital @xcite .",
    "thus , engineering the mechanical mode to provide large @xmath10 is essential to achieve large @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , for the fundamental out - of - plane flexural mode of a cantilever of width @xmath13 , thickness @xmath14 , and length @xmath15 , we can use euler - bernoulli beam theory @xcite to show that    @xmath16    this sharp inverse scaling of @xmath10 with cantilever dimensions highlights the importance of working with small resonators .",
    "it is analogous to the @xmath17 scaling of the single photon rabi frequency in cqed , where @xmath18 is the electromagnetic mode volume . to achieve the strong coupling condition in eq .",
    "[ cooperativity ] , assuming an nv spin coherence time @xmath19 ms , a mechanical quality factor @xmath20 , and cryogenic operation temperatures ( 4k or lower ) , cantilevers of width @xmath21 nm and length @xmath22 @xmath23 m ( corresponding mechanical frequency , @xmath24 few hundred mhz ) that provide @xmath25 few hundred hz are required . towards this end ,",
    "our devices in this work have @xmath13 of the order of a few hundred nm .",
    "this is typically the length scale at which proximity to surfaces begins to deteriorate the photostability of the nv charge state .",
    "incorporating photostable nv centers close to surfaces @xcite , particularly in nanostructures with small transverse dimensions such as nanophotonic cavities @xcite , has been found to be a considerably challenging task in recent years . to prevent charge state blinking and photo - ionization of nvs under optical excitation @xcite , high quality surfaces with low defect density , and appropriate surface termination are necessary .",
    "recent advances in annealing and surface passivation procedures @xcite have significantly improved the ability to retain photostable nv centers generated by ion implantation even after fabrication of nanostructures around them @xcite . using these techniques in combination with our angled reactive ion etching ( rie ) fabrication scheme @xcite ( details discussed in appendix a )",

    "the classical effect of driving the mechanical mode on the nv ground state is frequency modulation of the two transitions between @xmath37 and @xmath38 levels . from the strain susceptibilities measured in [ 8 ] , and finite element calculations on our structures ,",
    "we anticipate a frequency modulation comparable to the esr linewidth , when the mechanical mode is driven to an amplitude of @xmath51500 nm .    at the chosen nitrogen ion implantation density , we expect @xmath52 nv centers within our confocal laser spot .",
    "esr measurements are performed on such an nv ensemble at a fixed position in the cantilever , and simultaneously , the flexural mode shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) is driven by supplying an rf voltage to the piezo actuator at the resonance frequency @xmath49 .",

    "thus , at a given location in the cantilever , all four nv classes experience the same axial and transverse strain amplitudes , and hence experience identical transition frequency modulation .",
    "effects of inhomogeneous coupling strength due to implantation straggle , and varying lateral position within the confocal laser spot are addressed in appendix b. low microwave power was used to prevent power broadening , and retain near native linewidths in the esr .",

    "the hyperfine structure is washed out , and at 0 dbm , the overall esr dip is even broader .",
    "such broadening of the esr signal with progressively larger mechanical amplitude is expected , since the measurement sequence involves dwelling at each microwave frequency sample for many ( @xmath57 ) cycles of the mechanical oscillation period . as a result",
    ", we would expect to average over the ac modulation of the microwave transition , and detect an overall broadening determined by the modulation amplitude .        to verify that the esr broadening arises from the mechanical mode",
    ", we perform the same measurement at a fixed drive power of -12 dbm , and multiple drive frequencies around resonance . the slight asymmetry in the driven mechanical response ( fig . [",

    "dynamic actuation and transduction of single crystal diamond resonators up to frequencies of 50 mhz was achieved with dielectric gradient forces in @xcite , and up to 6 ghz was achieved by using cavity optomechanics in @xcite . given these developments , we anticipate that the major engineering challenge for strain - mediated strong spin - phonon coupling will be the ability to maintain photostable nvs in nanostructures with extremely small widths ( the current state - of - the - art being nanobeams with @xmath74 nm in @xcite ) . another challenge is the demand for high q - factors in the @xmath75 range from small resonators , which are usually challenging to engineer for high q @xcite .",

    "taking into account the roughly linear variation of strain along the length of the cantilever , we expect a @xmath83 variation in coupling strength within the confocal spot due to lateral distribution of nvs . this is less than the order of the error in the fitted estimate for @xmath73 .",

    "<S> nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers can couple to confined phonons in diamond mechanical resonators via the effect of lattice strain on their energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> access to the strong spin - phonon coupling regime with this system requires resonators with nanoscale dimensions in order to overcome the weak strain response of the nv ground state spin sublevels . in this work , we study nvs in diamond cantilevers with lateral dimensions of a few hundred nm . </S>",
    "<S> coupling of the nv ground state spin to the mechanical mode is detected in electron spin resonance ( esr ) , and its temporal dynamics are measured via spin echo . </S>",
    "<S> our small mechanical mode volume leads to a 10 - 100@xmath0 enhancement in spin - phonon coupling strength over previous nv - strain coupling demonstrations . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important step towards strong spin - phonon coupling , which can enable phonon - mediated quantum information processing and quantum metrology . </S>"
