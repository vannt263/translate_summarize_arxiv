    "the existence of self - organized critical dynamics in complex systems has traditionally been demonstrated through numerical simulation of certain classes of cellular automata referred to as sandpile models @xcite .",
    "non - linear , spatio - temporal dynamics is always essential for the emergence of soc behavior , but the details of this dynamics for a specific natural system is often poorly understood and/or not accessible to observation . in many cases the information available is in the form of time - series of spatially averaged data like stock - price indices , geomagnetic indices , or global temperature data . for scientists who deal with such data a natural question to ask is : are there specific signatures of soc dynamics that can be detected from such data ?    in this letter we shall report some results which provide a partial answer to such a question",
    ". some important statistical features of the toppling activity are common to most weakly driven sandpile models described in the literature , and these are used to formulate a stochastic model for the toppling activity signal . a benchmark case against which",
    "our results are tested , is a numerical study of the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) sandpile @xcite .",
    "a crucial step in our work is a re - scaling of the dynamical variables which allows a natural passage to the thermodynamic ( continuum ) limit .",
    "we demonstrate that this leads to new results concerning soc scaling laws .",
    "we find that the probability density function ( pdf ) for the toppling activity is a stretched exponential or close to the bramwell - holdsworth - pinton distribution @xcite , depending on whether the sandpile is so slowly driven that avalanches are well separated , or it is driven so hard that several avalanches run simultaneously .",
    "the pdf for avalanche durations is unique in the thermodynamic limit , but is not a power law , unless we redefine the meaning of an avalanche to be the activity burst between successive times for which the activity rises above a positive threshold .",
    "implementing such a threshold yields an exponent for the avalanche duration pdf of 1.63 , in agreement with @xcite , but in contradiction to @xcite .",
    "it also gives power - law quiet - time statistics as in @xcite and thus refuting the claim in @xcite that soc implies power - law distributed avalanche durations , but poisson - distributed quiet times .",
    "the sandpile models considered in this short paper deal with a @xmath0-dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites each of which are occupied by a certain integer number of quanta which we conveniently can think of as sand grains .",
    "the dynamics on the lattice is given by a toppling rule which implies that if the number of grains on a site exceeds a prescribed threshold , the grains on that site are distributed to its nearest neighbors .",
    "if the occupation number of some of these neighbors exceed the toppling threshold these sites will topple in the next time step , and the dynamics continues as an avalanche until all sites are stable .",
    "the details of this toppling rule can vary , but a useful theory for a broad class of natural phenomena should not be very sensitive to such detail .    in natural systems",
    "the soc dynamics is usually driven by some weak random external forcing . in sandpile models",
    "this can be modeled by dropping of sand grains at randomly selected sites at widely separated times . in numerical algorithms this is often done by dropping sand grains only at those times when no avalanche is running .",
    "this ensures that the drive does not interfere with the avalanching process .",
    "usually it will then only take a few time steps from one avalanche has stopped until a new starts , so for a large system the quiet times between avalanches will appear insignificant compared to their durations .",
    "a more physical drive would be to drop sand also during avalanches .",
    "if the dropping rate is slower than the typical duration of a system - size avalanche the drive would still not interfere with the avalanche dynamics , but the quiet times would depend on the statistical distribution of dropping times , which is typically a poisson distribution . in many natural systems , however , avalanching occurs all the time , corresponding to a higher driving rate . in such cases , and also because there will always be noise in time - series data , we can not identify the start and termination of an avalanche from a zero condition of our observable . in practice",
    "we have to define avalanches as _ bursts _ in the time series identified by a threshold on the signal @xcite . in a sandpile simulation",
    "such bursts are correlated and therefore the quiet times between the bursts are power - law distributed even if the dropping of sand grains is chosen to be a poisson process . hence if focus is on modeling features that can be detected in observational data we shall think of avalanches as activity bursts starting and terminating at a non - zero threshold value . moreover , one of the main results of this work is that power - law shape of the pdf for avalanche duration is true _ only _ if one defines avalanches in this way .",

    "the sandpile evolves in discrete time steps labeled by @xmath11 , and the number of sites whose occupation number exceeds the toppling threshold at time @xmath12 is called the toppling activity @xmath13 .",
    "the toppling increment is @xmath14 .",
    "let us define two active sites as dynamically connected if they have at least one common nearest neighbor , and define a connected cluster as a collection of active sites which are linked trough such connections . from numerical simulations of sandpiles we observe that such clusters never consist of more than a few elements and that the instantaneous number of clusters @xmath15 increases in proportion to @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that at each time @xmath12 we can label the clusters by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant depending on the specific toppling rule and the dimension @xmath18 of the sandpile .",
    "we can then decompose the increment @xmath19 into a sum of local increment contributions @xmath20 produced by each of the clusters , i.e. @xmath21 we think of the local increment contributions as random variables which take values in a finite sample space .",
    "indeed , if each cluster @xmath22 only consists of a single overcritical site , then @xmath23 takes values in the set @xmath24 .    as a first step to a stochastic model",
    "we make a mean - field assumption @xcite , which impiles that @xmath20 and @xmath25 are statistically independent for @xmath26 .",
    "then the central limit theorem states that in the limit @xmath27 , @xmath28 the conditional probability density @xmath29 $ ] of an increment @xmath19 , given @xmath13 , is gaussian with variance @xmath30 , where @xmath31 -(e[\\xi_{n , i}|x_n])^2)$ ] .",
    "this has been verified numerically in the two - dimensional btw - model as shown in fig .",
    "the figure demonstrates the need to introduce a conditional probability : the conditional variance of the increments is proportional to @xmath8 and the conditional mean is not zero .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations show that the the conditional mean increment , @xmath32 $ ] , is positive for small @xmath8 , reflecting the natural tendency for the activity to grow when it is small . on the other hand",
    "the mean increment decays exponentially to zero for moderate @xmath8 , and becomes negative when @xmath8 is comparable to the activity of a system - size avalanche , reflecting the limiting influence of the finite system size .",
    "these effects will be incorporated as a drift - term correction to the model , but for now we consider for simplicity of argument a gaussian process with non - stationary increments and no drift term : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a stationary gaussian stochastic process with unit variance . from the numerical sandpile data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we observe that the _ normalized _ toppling process @xmath35 has the characteristics of a fractional brownian walk with hurst exponent @xmath36 on time scales shorter than the characteristic growth time for a system - size avalanche , consistent with a power spectrum which scales like @xmath37 . thus we model the normalized increment process as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a fractional brownian walk with hurst exponent @xmath40 . for the transition to the thermodynamic limit , where time will become a continuous variable",

    "this process has the property @xmath42 .",

    "[ sde ] through an @xmath45-dependent drift term .",
    "however , the distributions of duration and size of sub - system size avalanches ( defined by a threshold @xmath46 ) is not sensitive to this feature of the bwt model .",
    "we have given a detailed treatment of this problem in @xcite .",
    "] where @xmath47 can be interpreted as a fractal dimension of the set of active sites imbedded in the @xmath18-dimensional lattice space .",
    "this property is used to re - scale @xmath13 such that it has a well - defined limit as @xmath48 .",
    "we also have to re - scale the time variable by letting @xmath49 , where @xmath50",

    "( [ stocheq1 ] ) , by introduction of the limit function @xmath56 , reduces to the stochastic differential equation @xmath57 where we have heuristically added a drift term @xmath58 to account for the non - zero mean of the conditional increment .",

    "we consider the avalanche as terminated , and a new , independent realization of @xmath68 is generated and used to produce the next avalanche . from long , stationary time - series generated from the stochastic model and from the sandpile model this way , we can construct pdfs @xmath66 which turn out to give almost identical results for the two models ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the shape of this pdf is universal in the thermodynamic limit : a stretched exponential @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "a different pdf appears if the time - series are constructed by launching the avalanches at random times ( poisson - distributed ) with characteristic time between launches shorter than the growth time of a system size avalanche . in this case",
    "several avalanches may run simultaneously , and @xmath66 from both models are close to the bramwell - holdsworth - pinton distribution , which was claimed to be valid for the toppling - activity in the btw - model in @xcite .",
