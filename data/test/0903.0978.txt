    "active galactic nuclei are powerful sources of radiation in a wide spectral range : from @xmath1 rays to radio waves .",
    "they derive their extraordinary luminosities ( sometimes more than @xmath2 times higher than luminosities of `` ordinary '' galaxies ) from energy release by matter accreting towards , and falling into , a central supermassive black hole ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to the unification model of agn @xcite , their central engine consists of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with mass ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 solar masses @xmath5",
    "@xcite , which is surrounded by an accretion disk that radiates in the x - ray band @xcite . the vast majority of the x - ray sources in the universe are agn .",
    "the integral emission of agn reflects the history of accretion onto smbh over cosmic time .",
    "emission lines are usually seen in the x - ray spectra of agn .",
    "the broad emission fe k@xmath0 spectral line ( 6.46.9  kev , depending on ionization state ) with asymmetric profile ( narrow bright blue peak and a wide faint red wing ) has been observed in a number of type 1 agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "early results from the asca ( _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ )",
    "era suggested that broad relativistic lines might be common in type 1 agn .",
    "however , surprisingly , they have been detected in significant number and their features described in only a small fraction of those sources @xcite .",
    "the first and the best studied one is mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite .    in some cases",
    "the line width corresponds to one third of speed of light , indicating that its emitters rotate with relativistic velocities .",
    "therefore , the line is probably produced in a very compact region near the central black hole of agn and can provide us some essential information about the plasma conditions and the space - time geometry in vicinity of the black hole . consequently ,",
    "if the line is emitted close enough to the smbh , it shows a broad relativistic profile affected by smbh spin @xcite and gravitational redshift ( as well as other general relativistic effects ) @xcite .",
    "several studies have been performed over samples of local agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) , as well as from distant quasars @xcite in order to characterize the fe k@xmath0 emission .",
    "@xcite performed a spectral analysis of a sample of 26 type 1 to 1.9 seyferts galaxies ( @xmath6 ) observed by _ xmm - newton_. they found that a relativistic line is significantly detected in a half of their sample ( 54@xmath710 percent ) with a mean equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath8  80  ev , but around 30% of selected agn showed a relativistic broad line that can be explained by the emission of an accretion disk .",
    "accretion disks could have different forms , dimensions , and emission , depending on the type of central black hole , whether it is rotating ( kerr metric ) or non - rotating ( schwarzschild metric ) .",
    "they represent an efficient mechanism for extracting gravitational potential energy and converting it into radiation , giving us the most probable explanation for the main characteristics of agn ( high luminosity , compactness , jet formation , rapid time variations in radiation and the profile of the fe k@xmath0 spectral line ) .    here",
    "we discuss the x - ray radiation from relativistic accretion disks around supermassive black holes , supposed to exist in the centers of agn .",
    "especially , we discuss the fe k@xmath0 line profile which originates from the accretion disk . moreover , we also present some effects which can disturb the fe k@xmath0 profile , such as : perturbations in the disk emissivity , absorbtion by warm absorbers and gravitational microlensing .",
    "the aim of this chapter is to present a short overview of results of some recent investigations in this field , and it is divided into the following six sections : _ active galactic nuclei as hosts of supermassive black holes _ - where the main features , classification and unified model of active galaxies are briefly presented , _ space - time geometry in vicinity of supermassive black holes _ - where the basic definitions of schwarzschild and kerr metrics are given , _ accretion disk around a supermassive black hole _ - where we explain the standard model of an accretion disk , including its emission , accretion rate , luminosity , structure and spectral distribution , _ supermassive black holes and x - ray emission _ - where the focus is on the modeling of the observed x - ray radiation from relativistic accretion disk around a supermassive black hole of agn in both the fe k@xmath0 spectral line and x - ray continuum , _ variability of x - ray emission around supermassive black hole _ - where we present the main causes of rapid and irregular variability of the x - ray emission which can be due to disk instability , reflecting in perturbations of its emissivity , or it could be caused by some external effects , such as gravitational microlensing and absorption by x - ray absorbers , and finally _ conclusion _ - where the most important results from previous sections are pointed out and their brief summary is given .    finally , we should note that a huge number of papers devoted to investigation of the x - ray emission of agn was published in the last two decades , so it was not possible to mention all of them here , but more details and references can be found in review papers such as e.g. @xcite , etc .",
    "active galaxies differ from the so called `` normal '' galaxies in the amount of energy emitted from their nuclei .",
    "the term _ active galactic nuclei _ ( agn ) refers to the energetic phenomena in the central region of a galaxy which can not be solely or directly produced by stars .",
    "the nebular - like emission spectra of ngc 1068 , ngc 4051 and ngc 4151 , with h@xmath0 , [ o ii ] @xmath93727 , [ ne iii ] @xmath93869 and [ o iii ] @xmath10 4363,4959,5007 were observed by @xcite , but the first classification of these objects was made by @xcite .",
    "he recognized these objects as a class of galaxies with strong and high - excitation optical emission lines localized in the nuclei .",
    "active galaxies have been the subject of an intensive astrophysical investigations for the last 3  4 decades . as the most luminous objects with one of the most powerful energy release rates and with the most compact dimensions , agn are of the great interest in modern astrophysics .",
    "agn ( i.e. quasars ) are the brightest objects in the universe and thus , these objects are important for the studies of the early universe and cosmology in general .",
    "for instance , studies of their luminosity functions or quasar host galaxies are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies in general .",
    "the class of active galaxies contains many different objects , such as quasars , gigantic elliptic radio galaxies , luminous spiral seyfert galaxies , blazars , etc .",
    "agn are the most luminous objects in the universe and they have luminosities in the range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , that can be @xmath14 times greater than in the case of a typical galaxy .",
    "apart from their great luminosities , agn are emitting in the broad band of electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the observed emission of agn is in the continuum and in lines , from the @xmath1 and x domains to the far infrared and radio bands ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the characteristics of agn is violent and fast variability observed in different parts of electromagnetic spectra .",
    "fast changes in the agn brightness are observed sometimes just for a couple of days , e.g. in the case of galaxy ngc 4151 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the emission regions in the agn have small dimensions ( from only couple of light days up to couple of light months ) .",
    "also , the brightness of agn can be so high that the brightness of the host galaxy can be neglected in the total brightness ( for instance in the case of quasars ) .",
    "consequently , they are compact regions which could not be directly observed in the most bands of electromagnetic spectrum . therefore , agn and their physical / kinematical properties are indirectly studied through the analysis of their spectra .",
    "in contrast to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an ordinary galaxy ( that represents a sum of stellar spectra , thus the most of its luminosity comes within no more than one decade of frequency ) , agn emit across the broad range of frequencies ( of order @xmath3 hz ) . the agn continuum in a number of high - luminosity sources peaks in the ultraviolet , i.e. in the so called big blue bump ( bbb ) @xcite .",
    "the bbb is attributed to the thermal emission from an optically thick region of the accretion disk @xcite , or from optically thin regions , i.e. free - free emission @xcite .",
    "the observed sed in agn is remarkably different from the thermal ( black - body ) spectrum of a star or a regular galaxy @xcite .",
    "this featureless continuum observed in agn characterizes the main source of energy input and suggests that the mechanisms that produce it are common to all types of agn .",
    "the sed can be approximated with the power law function @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the spectral index @xcite .",
    "the observed continuum of a typical seyfert 1 galaxy is very strong compared with seyfert 2 galaxies ; as a result seyfert 1 galaxies appear to be more luminous than seyfert 2-s .",
    "some agn have the sed almost flat from the infrared to x - ray part of the spectrum , so that the spectral index is @xmath16 , although it is usually steeper . in the radio band ,",
    "the brightness of active galaxies is usually an order of magnitude higher than of normal galaxies .",
    "but still , even if it is so intensive , the radio luminosity is never higher more than 1% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "another property of agn is strong x - ray flux , with the x - ray continuum produced by lower energy photons which are compton scattered to higher energies by relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the power emitted in the x - ray emission is three or four times larger in agn than in normal galaxies @xcite , therefore the x - emission can indicate the presence of agn .    today",
    ", it is widely accepted that the mechanism which powers agn is accretion onto supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , i.e. the greatest part of the continuum emission comes from an accretion disk and its corona .",
    "the mass of the supermassive black hole is estimated to be from @xmath3 to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the center of an agn there is a supermassive black hole with an accretion disk surrounded by gas and dust in the form of a torus .",
    "there are also other emitting regions present in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole , such as ionized gas clouds that produce intensive emission lines or jets of matter that are mostly visible in the radio band , but sometimes they can also be seen in the optical band .",
    "the kinematics of these regions is very complex as well as the physical processes that produce such specific spectra of these objects . in the central part",
    ", there are mainly three emitting line regions : fe k@xmath0 ( in the x - ray range ) , broad and narrow line emitting regions ( blr and nlr , respectively ; in optical / uv spectra ) .    in the optical and uv band ,",
    "the total flux of emission ( and occasionally absorbtion ) lines contributes from several percent to tens of percent of the continuum flux .",
    "the existence of the broad and narrow emission lines comes from the fact that an agn contains two separated emission line regions with different kinematics , density , ionization , optical thickness and radiation transfer .",
    "the basic characteristics of the blr and nlr can be described as follows :    -    blr is a compact region , with dimensions from only couple of light days up to couple of light weeks @xcite , that is located in the vicinity of the black hole ( @xmath181 pc ) .",
    "the structure of this region is very complex and most likely it consists from at least two separated subregions ( see e.g.@xcite , etc ) .",
    "the ionized gas in this region is of relatively high density ( @xmath19 ) and temperature @xmath20 k. emitters are moving with high velocities , up to 10000 km / s . in this region",
    "the broad emission lines ( bels ) from allowed transitions are formed .",
    "nlr extends even up to 1 kpc far from the central source @xcite .",
    "the density in this region is significantly smaller ( @xmath21 ) than in the blr , while the temperature is on the same order of magnitude as in the blr . from this region",
    "the narrow emission lines ( nels ) arise , indicating a random motion of the emitting gas smaller than 1000 km@xmath22 .",
    "nels are often coming from the forbidden transitions .",
    "the physical properties of this region are much closer to the properties of emission nebulae than to the blr .    according to the different characteristics mentioned above ,",
    "there are several classes of agn .",
    "the first group of stellar systems with active nuclei consists of seyfert galaxies .",
    "these are spiral galaxies with very bright nuclei which spectra have strong emission lines of neutral and multi - ionized emitters .",
    "the presence of highly ionized emission lines indicates the existence of a non - stellar ionization continuum .",
    "the presence or absence of bels ( i.e. blr ) has been historically used to separate seyfert galaxies into two classes .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies have broad permitted ( h i , he i and he ii ) and narrow permitted and forbidden lines ( such as [ o iii ] @xmath95007 ) , while seyfert 2 galaxies have only narrow permitted and forbidden lines @xcite .",
    "this simple seyfert classification scheme can be further sub - divided according to specific spectral properties @xcite , as e.g. seyfert galaxies with intermediate balmer profiles are classified as seyfert 1.5-s with apparent narrow balmer line components superimposed on broad wings .",
    "many low luminosity galaxies have a nucleus that resembles the seyfert 2 nucleus , but with the spectrum that shows the forbidden lines from lower ionization states .",
    "therefore , these galaxies are called low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions , i.e liners .",
    "active galaxies which emit intensively in the radio band are so called radio galaxies ( rg ) .",
    "radio galaxies are dominantly elliptic galaxies that are divided into two morphologically different types : fr i and fr ii .",
    "the classification is done according to the relative position of the surface brightness maximum ( called the hot spot ) in the radio lobes .",
    "for example , in the fr i radio galaxy the distance between the hot spot in the radio lobes is less than half of the maximum diameter of the radio source , while in the fr ii type this distance is larger @xcite . like seyfert galaxies , radio galaxies can be divided into subgroups according to the widths of their emission lines , i.e. narrow line radio galaxies ( nlrg ) that emit narrow emission lines characteristic for seyfert 2 galaxies , and broad line radio galaxies ( blrg ) that emit broad lines as seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "being the most powerful sources in the universe , quasars belong to the group of active galaxies with the absolute magnitude @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "these quasi stellar ( quasars ) objects emit intensively in the radio domain and their spectrum shows broad emission lines significantly redshifted . in this group of agn there are also quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) which have the same observed properties as quasars , except they are weak radio sources . besides , there is a group of qsos with broad absorption lines , so called broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) .    finally , the separate class of agn are so called bl lacerte ( lacs ) objects .",
    "bl lacs are nuclei of elliptical galaxies that emit highly variable and polarized radiation , and have a non thermal optical continuum and a strong radio emission . with this group of galaxies ,",
    "we often connect another type of agn , optically violently variable ( ovvs ) quasars .",
    "the ovvs , in contrast to bl lacs which have featureless continuum , emit broad optical emission lines characteristic for quasars .",
    "both these groups of objects are often referred to as one class called blazars .      as it was mentioned above , all types of agn have some common properties .",
    "it is widely accepted that central engine of an agn is accretion onto supermassive black hole .",
    "first observational evidence in favor of a unified model of agn was spectropolarometric observations of seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found broad balmer lines and fe ii emission , characteristic of a seyfert 1 spectrum , in the polarized spectrum of ngc 1068 .    in the unified model of agn @xcite both types of seyfert galaxies are intrinsically the same .",
    "the difference in spectral characteristics appears due to different angle of the visibility of the central regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig23_1 ] ) .",
    "a geometrically and optically thick dusty molecular torus - like structure surrounds the central source , as well as the blr ( see fig .",
    "therefore the visibility of the nuclear engine depends on viewing angle with respect to the torus .",
    "the broad - line polarization in seyfert 2-s is probably due to electron scattering .",
    "this picture is consistent with the differences observed between continuum fluxes of the seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "following the unified model , the line - of - sights to seyfert 2 galaxies ( or narrow line objects ) are obstructed by optically thick material corresponding to hydrogen column densities of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for column densities @xmath25 , photons above a few kev can penetrate the torus creating an un - obstructed view of the nuclear source . in this case",
    "the source is called _",
    "compton thin_. for column densities @xmath26 , only high energy x - ray emission ( tens of kev ) can pass through the obscuring material @xcite .",
    "but in the case @xmath27 even high energy x - rays , above a few tens of kev , are compton scattered and the nuclear source is completely hidden from our direct view .",
    "therefore , by observing near the edge - on torus , one can detect narrow line objects , with weak ( or without ) x - ray emission ; while by observing near the face - on torus , one can detect blazars or ovvs .",
    "the broad line objects can be detected if one observes an inclined torus .",
    "as it was shown in the previous section , according to unified model of agn , in their heart there is a supermassive black hole with mass up to @xmath17 , surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "a black hole is a region of space - time around some collapsed mass which gravitational field became so powerful that nothing ( including electromagnetic radiation ) could escape from its attraction , after crossing the certain boundary called the event horizon @xcite .",
    "all black holes in nature are commonly classified according to their mass as : supermassive black holes ( with masses @xmath28 ) , intermediate - mass black holes ( @xmath29 ) , stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath30 ) , mini and micro black holes ( @xmath31 ) . in this chapter",
    "our focus will be on supermassive black holes located in the centers of agn , because they are surrounded by accretion disks which x - ray radiation is the main subject of this discussion .",
    "space - time geometry in vicinity of a supermassive black hole depends on its type ( more precisely , on its angular momentum ) , being either non - rotating , where the local space - time geometry is described by schwarzschild metric , or rotating , where the kerr metric determines the geometry of local space - time .",
    "the term black hole was introduced in 1969 by the american scientist john wheeler , but the predecessor of the modern idea of black holes emerged in the late eighteenth century .",
    "it was independently developed by the british geologist john michell in 1783 and the french mathematician and astronomer pierre - simon laplace in 1796 .",
    "this idea was based on newton s theory of gravity and particle theory of light , and is commonly referred to as a dark star .",
    "a dark star is , according to michell , a sufficiently massive and compact star which have such a strong gravitational field that the corresponding surface escape velocity equals or exceeds the speed of light .",
    "therefore , any light emitted from the surface of such star would be dragged back by the gravitational field and we would not be able to see it , but we could still feel its gravitational attraction @xcite .",
    "after the wave theory of light was founded , the idea about a dark star was forgotten since , according to the wave theory , it was not clear that light could be affected by gravity at all .",
    "modern theory of black holes was founded in the twentieth century , more precisely in 1915 , shortly after einstein introduced the theory of general relativity , when the german physicist and astronomer karl schwarzschild found a particular exact solution to the einstein field equations , for the limited case of a single spherical non - rotating mass .",
    "the implications of the general relativity to the stellar evolution were firstly understood by subrahmanyan chandrasekhar in 1928 @xcite .",
    "he calculated a maximum limit for the mass of a star , above which the star would not be able to support itself ( by repulsion of electron degeneracy pressure which arises from pauli exclusion principle ) against its own gravity , after it had used up all its fuel .",
    "this limit ( @xmath32 ) is nowadays known as the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "if a star s mass is less than this limit , it can eventually stop contracting at a final state known as a `` white dwarf '' @xcite .",
    "a similar discovery was made in 1932 by the russian scientist lev davidovich landau .",
    "he found that there is another limiting mass ( @xmath33 ) , for which the corresponding final state is much smaller than a white dwarf and which would be supported against its gravity by the exclusion principle repulsion between neutrons and protons , rather than between electrons .",
    "such stars are therefore called neutron stars @xcite .",
    "all these results led to a surprising conclusion that a star which mass is above the chandrasekhar limit , when it comes to the end of its fuel , could experience a catastrophic gravitational collapse to a point with an infinite density .",
    "american scientist robert oppenheimer was the first who explained in 1939 that , according to general relativity , stars above @xmath34 would at the end of their lives collapse into black holes , due to reasons given by chandrasekhar @xcite .    with the discovery of qsos in the early 60s , the speculations about how their enormous luminosities could be produced within such a small region occurred .",
    "thermonuclear reactions were not enough efficient , and therefore , they were quickly eliminated . hoyle and",
    "fowler suggested in 1963 that such luminosities could be produced during the collapses and disintegrations of stelar - type objects with masses of @xmath35 @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "soon , it became clear that the energy source was gravitational .",
    "for example , wheeler suggested a mechanism in which gravitational singularity at the center of a galaxy converted the falling matter into energy @xcite .",
    "zeldovich , novikov and salpeter proposed in 1964 the release of energy through accretion due the growth of a massive object at the center of a galaxy , while lynden - bell in 1969 made an attempt to explain the phenomena observed in qsos and seyfert galaxies in terms of a black hole formalism @xcite .",
    "a crucial event for the acceptance of black holes was the discovery of pulsars by jocelyn bell in 1967 , because it was the clear evidence of the existence of neutron stars , and therefore , confirmation of chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the first detection of a solar mass black hole came in 1972 , when the mass of the rapidly variable x - ray source cygnus x-1 was proven to be above the maximum allowed for a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the first convincing evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes is the discovery of the fe @xmath37 spectral line in x - ray spectrum of seyfert galaxy mgc-6 - 30 - 15 by @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the black hole theory is very well established , mainly due to the contributions of numerous authors during the second half of the twentieth century , like roy kerr , werner israel , john wheeler , brandon carter , roger penrose , stephen hawking and many others .",
    "schwarzschild metric describes the space - time geometry in spherically symmetric gravitational field around a time - steady non - rotating black hole in vacuum .",
    "the solution of the einstein field equations under these conditions was found by karl schwarzschild in 1916 @xcite .",
    "if we denote the schwarzschild radius which corresponds to a mass @xmath38 by @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant and @xmath41 is the speed of light ) , then the squared element of space - time interval @xmath42 in the case of schwarzschild metric is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the time coordinate measured by a stationary clock at infinity ( which must be distinguished from the proper time @xmath45 , measured by a clock moving with the particle ) , @xmath46 is the radial coordinate , @xmath47 is the colatitude ( angle from north ) in radians and @xmath48 is the longitude in radians .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq31_1 ] ) that schwarzschild metric depends only on the mass @xmath38 through the schwarzschild radius @xmath49 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric has an infinite space - time curvature ( i.e. a singularity ) at @xmath50 . in the case",
    "when @xmath51 this metric is reduced to the minkowski metric of flat space - time : @xmath52 .    if the complete mass @xmath38 collapses below its schwarzschild radius @xmath49 , then it will form a spherically symmetric schwarzschild black hole .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole has no charge or angular momentum and it can be distinguished from any other schwarzschild black hole only by its mass .    to a first approximation ,",
    "the matter surrounding a black hole may be assumed to rotate in circular keplerian orbits with velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath53 . therefore , taking into account that a maximum allowed rotation velocity is speed of light ( @xmath54 ) , one can obtain so called gravitational radius @xmath55 : @xmath56 which is usually used as a unit for distance around a black hole .",
    "roy kerr , a new zealand mathematician , found an exact solution of the einstein field equations of general relativity in the case of gravitational field outside an uncharged rotating black hole .",
    "the properties of kerr solution , known as kerr metric , are given in numerous papers and books ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore , here we will present only its definition and some basic features , necessary for the further discussion .",
    "contrary to the schwarzschild case , the kerr metric is no longer spherically symmetric . in the case of a rotating black hole with mass @xmath38 and angular momentum @xmath57 ,",
    "this metric is given by ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 above definition is given in boyer - lindquist coordinates for @xmath60 .",
    "as it can be seen from expressions ( [ eq32_1 ] ) and ( [ eq32_2 ] ) , in addition to black hole mass @xmath38 , the kerr metric also depends on its specific angular momentum @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 because any additional angular momentum would increase the energy of the black hole and , therefore , its mass @xcite . in the case of a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath63 , it reduces to the schwarzschild metric .    by solving the equation @xmath64 and taking only a root with @xmath65 sign",
    ", we obtain the radius of event horizon of a black hole : @xmath66 thus , when @xmath63 then @xmath67 ( because we assumed that @xmath60 ) , whereas when @xmath68 ( i.e. for a maximally rotating black hole ) then @xmath69 .",
    "the minimum allowed radius @xmath70 of a stable circular equatorial orbit , or so called marginally stable orbit , is given by the roots of the equation @xcite : @xmath71 , where the upper sign refers to co - rotating orbits , while the lower one to counter - rotating orbits . in the case of schwarzschild metric ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73 , whereas for a maximally rotating black hole ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "rotating black holes are surrounded by a region called the ergosphere , in which there can be no static observers and the negative energy orbits are possible @xcite .",
    "also , there is a general relativistic effect known as frame - dragging , according to which a rotating black hole drags the space - time around itself , but such effects will not be discussed here in more details .",
    "some observed quasars have luminosities of up to @xmath77 erg / s @xcite . the corresponding total energy emitted during the lifetime of such quasars",
    "can be estimated to @xmath78 erg , assuming that their minimum age is about @xmath79 years and that their luminosities do not change significantly over the lifetime @xcite .",
    "only two known mechanisms could produce such enormous amount of energy : nuclear fusion and accretion .",
    "the maximum efficiency @xmath80 ( defined as the mass fraction of fuel that is converted into energy , according to @xmath81 ) of thermonuclear reactions is @xmath82 .",
    "@xcite showed that this value is too low to explain such high energies of @xmath83 erg .",
    "accretion is the only remaining mechanism which can yield larger @xmath80 .",
    "its maximum efficiency is about @xmath84 for a non - rotating black hole and @xmath85 for a maximally rotating one @xcite .",
    "therefore , agn release their enormous energy by matter accreting towards , and falling into , a central supermassive black hole .",
    "if the cold matter , which was initially at rest and without magnetic field , was subjected to free radial infall it would accrete to the central black hole without any energy release or observational effects @xcite . however , in the case of agn the accreting matter has a significant angular momentum which does not allow its free infall . at the marginally stable orbit of central black hole with mass of @xmath86 ,",
    "the specific angular momentum is @xmath87 , which is much less even in comparison to a typical galaxy where the speciffic angular momentum of orbiting material is @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "it means that approach of accreting material toward a black hole requires a loss of the greatest fraction of its initial angular momentum .",
    "mechanisms which can contribute to such loss of angular momentum are viscosity , nonaxisymmetric gravitational forces , magnetic forces , etc . @xcite .",
    "since the orbit of minimum energy for fixed angular momentum in any spherically symmetric potential is a circle , the infall of accreting material due to loss of its angular momentum will be in form of successively smaller and smaller concentric circles .",
    "matter traveling along orbits inclined to each other will eventually collide in the plane of intersection , and as a result , the angular momenta of different gas steams will be mixed and equalized .",
    "consequently , all accreting matter will orbit in a single plane and will have the same specific angular momentum at any given radius , meaning that accretion is most likely performed through an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the accreting material is able to approach the marginally stable orbit of central black hole only if there is an efficient mechanism for transporting angular momentum outward .",

    "a significant part of this chapter was devoted to modeling of the observed x - ray radiation in both the fe k@xmath0 spectral line and x - ray continuum .",
    "the modeled x - ray radiation is then used to analyze the several effects of strong gravity in the vicinity of black holes which have the influence on the shapes and intensities of the observed fe k@xmath0 line and x - ray continum .",
    "we showed that the x - ray emission strongly depends on the angular momentum and mass of the central black hole , as well as on several parameters describing the x - ray emitting region in the disk .",
    "this was demonstrated on several examples , showing various aspects of the x - ray emission from the accretion disk around schwarzschild and kerr black holes .",
    "since the x - ray radiation is probably produced in a very compact region near the black holes , such comparison between observed and modeled x - ray radiation can provide us some essential information about the plasma conditions and the space - time geometry in the vicinity of those black holes .",
    "we also studied some possible causes for the rapid and irregular variability of the fe k@xmath0 line and x - ray continuum , observed in the x - ray spectra of some agn .",
    "our results show that , at least , three mechanisms could explain such variability : perturbations of disk emissivity , absorption by warm x - ray absorbers and gravitational microlensing .    taking all this into account",
    ", we can conclude that the x - ray emission from accretion disks of agn can be used as a powerful tool for revealing the physics and geometry in the vicinity of their central supermassive black holes .",
    "but , to use the fe k@xmath0 line profile for such investigations , one should also take into account the effects which can disturb its profile ( such as e.g. absorption , perturbations in the disk and gravitational lensing ) .",
