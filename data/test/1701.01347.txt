    "the formation mechanism of compact objects , neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs ) , is an unsolved problem in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "a model for the formation of such objects requires to perform physically - motivated simulations of the core - collapse supernova , which is computationally challenging ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another possible way to investigate the formation of nss and bhs is to study the birth and evolution of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) hosting a bh or a ns accreting from a stellar companion .",
    "the orbital parameters , peculiar velocities and galactic position of these binaries directly follow from their evolutionary history , and are affected in particular by the conditions at the moment of compact object formation ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .    the measurement of pulsar proper motions ( see e.g. @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; ; @xcite ) , combined with the study of ns - xrbs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , has exposed evidence that some nss receive a low velocity , whereas others a high velocity at formation ( so called _ natal kicks _ , nks ) .",
    "the prevailing idea is that nss are formed either in a standard core - collapse supernova ( sn ) , or in a less energetic type of sn expected for star with small cores .",
    "the latter can take place either as an electron - capture sn or as an iron core - collapse sn with a small iron - core mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the case of bhs , observations are rather scarce and patchy , thus it is not yet possible to discriminate between different models of bh formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "one of our goals is to investigate whether the observed galactic distribution of xrbs hosting a bh ( bh - xrbs ) can reveal something about how bhs are formed .",
    "the main underlying idea is that any offset of a bh - xrb from the galactic plane ( assumed as birth place ) is a signature of some peculiar velocity of the system with respect to the circular galactic motion .",
    "the magnitude of such velocity gives clues on the sn mechanism , in particular on the magnitude of the nk at birth ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of using the galactic position and/or line of sight velocities of a population of xrbs to investigate the formation of compact objects was employed previously for the ns case ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ we covered the topic of bh formation in two previous works . in  @xcite",
    ", we followed the galactic trajectories of a simulated population of bh - xrbs , and investigated which nk distribution gives rise to the observed @xmath0-distribution of bh - xrbs ( where @xmath0 is the height above the galactic plane ) .",
    "the aim was to discriminate between _ high _ and _ reduced _ nks for bhs .",
    "high nks are larger than the nk expected in a standard formation scenario for bhs , in which the bh forms via fallback of material on to the proto - ns and the nk is caused by asymmetries in the sn ejecta . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the nk would conserve the linear - momentum and roughly scale as the nk received by the ns multiplied by the ratio between the mass of the bh and the mass of the ns .",
    "we call these kicks as _ reduced _ or _ momentum - conserving _ nks . if the ns receives a nk of the order of @xmath1 km / s , a @xmath2 bh would get a nk of @xmath3 km / s .",
    "we define _ high _ nks as @xmath4 km / s . in  @xcite",
    ", we found that high nks , comparable to ns nks , were required . in  @xcite , we combined the information from the kinematics and binary evolution of a subset of bh - xrbs to find evidence both for low and high nks .",
    "in this paper , we aim at complementing and extending those previous studies . following up on the work by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of the height above the galactic plane of bh - xrbs is similar to that of ns - xrbs , suggesting that bhs could also receive a _",
    "high _ kick at formation , or even one as high as nss . in this work",
    ", we develop this idea further .",
    "we build synthetic populations of bh- and ns - xrbs and we model their binary evolution and their kinematics in the galaxy , to investigate whether different assumptions on compact object formation ( such as a different distribution for the nk and/or a different amount of mass ejected in the sn ) have an imprint on the observed galactic distribution of bh- and ns - xrbs , and we quantify these effects .",
    "furthermore , we will dedicate part of this work to discuss a method we previously employed to calculate the minimum peculiar velocity at birth of individual bh - xrbs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the difference of the galactic potential value between the observed position @xmath5 and its projection on to the galactic plane was used to analytically derive a lower limit for the peculiar velocity at birth .",
    "this method has been recently challenged by @xcite .",
    "we investigate how robust our estimate is , i.e. how close this estimate is to the true value of the minimal peculiar velocity at birth , how this estimate scales with the distance from the galactic centre , and how it varies for different choices of the galactic potential . + the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : estimate ] we study our estimate for the peculiar velocity at birth of individual bh - xrbs . in section [ sec : bps ] we build synthetic populations of bh- and ns - xrbs for different assumptions on the compact object formation . in section [ sec : results ] we look at the galactic distributions of these synthetic binaries while investigating how they differ , and inferring which nk distribution fits best the observed galactic position of ns- and bh - xrbs . in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss our findings and in section [ sec : conclusion ] we draw our conclusions .",

    "xrbs are thought to originate from binary progenitors born in the galactic plane , the birth - place of most massive stars ( @xcite ) . when the compact object forms , the binary typically acquires a peculiar velocity .",
    "the mass ejection in the sn imparts a recoil velocity to the binary ; the nk adds up vectorially to this velocity , giving the total peculiar velocity of the binary , @xmath6 .",
    "such a systemic velocity adds up vectorially to the local galactic rotation and probably has no preferential orientation .",
    "the full 3d velocity is measured only for a handful of bh - xrbs ( see @xcite ) . for these ,",
    "the integration of the orbit backwards in time can in principle provide an estimate for @xmath6 at birth .",
    "however , uncertainty in the distance and differences in the galactic potential can prevent a unique determination of the initial position ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the full 3d peculiar velocity is not known , one can estimate @xmath6 at birth using a simple model .",

    "] , we expect a trajectory purely perpendicular to the plane to be the one which minimises the initial @xmath6 . in our previous works",

    "recently @xcite argued that the difference in the gravitational potential between the observed location and its projection on to the galactic plane is not an accurate estimate of the required minimum peculiar velocity at birth .",
    "he suggests that there are always possible trajectories different from a purely perpendicular one which require a lower @xmath10 at birth than the one estimated through equation [ eq : estimate ] to reach the same offset from the galactic plane .",
    "we check the validity of our estimate for the peculiar velocity at birth , @xmath11 , for high-@xmath0 sources , performing a monte carlo simulation using the python package for galactic dynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate @xmath12 points , whose initial conditions are set as follows : 1 ) the initial position is at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is uniformly distributed between @xmath15 and @xmath16 kpc ; 2 ) the initial peculiar velocity @xmath17 is uniform between @xmath15 and @xmath18 km / s ; 3 ) the orientation of this velocity is uniformly distributed over a sphere .",
    "we note that since we are only interested in the minimum value of @xmath17 , the shape of the assumed velocity distribution is not important .",
    "we add the circular motion in the galactic disc to the 3d peculiar velocity @xmath6 .",
    "we integrate the orbits in the galaxy for @xmath19 gyr , using a 4th - order runge - kutta integrator , and we check for conservation of energy over the trajectory making sure that the relative error on the energy is less than @xmath20 at the final step .",
    "we record the positions @xmath21 @xmath18 times over the orbit sampling from constant time steps , along with the initial peculiar velocity @xmath17 . from the simulated points , we select only those ones located at @xmath22 at the sampled times , to represent high-@xmath0 sources .",
    "we perform the simulation for three different choices of the galactic potential : model 2 of , @xcite , and the potential from @xcite , which are all multi - component potentials consisting of disc , bulge , and halo .",
    "the @xcite potential is made up of two miyamoto - nagai potentials for disc and bulge , and one pseudo - isothermal potential for the halo .",
    "the @xcite potential is made up of a power - law density profile with an exponential cut - off for the bulge , a miyamoto - nagai potential for the disc , and a navarro - frenk - white profile for the halo .",

    "figure [ fig : density ] shows that our analytical estimate ( eq . [ eq : estimate ] ) successfully describes the value and trend of the minimal peculiar velocity as a function of the galactocentric distance .    in order to better quantify the goodness of our estimator @xmath11 , we compute the ratio @xmath24 using @xmath25 kpc - wide bins in @xmath26 , for those points which reach a height above the galactic plane along their orbit in the range @xmath27 kpc .",

    "our estimate is steeper than the real minimal peculiar velocity for the first two potentials , i.e. , it varies strongly for small variation in @xmath26 .",

    "figure [ fig : density ] also shows that the galactic bulge ( @xmath43 kpc ) is much less populated ( an order of magnitude fewer systems than in regions at larger distance from the galactic center ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this : i ) the bulge volume is small ; ii ) it is unlikely for a binary born in the galactic disc to overcome the strong potential well in its motion towards the galactic bulge .",

    "the peculiar velocity right after the bh formation ( see figure [ fig : vsys ] ) would decrease due to the larger binary mass : by a factor of @xmath211 on average .",

    "the nk distribution of nss can be estimated via proper motion studies of pulsars .",
    "the pulsar birth speed distribution has been estimated as a maxwellian distribution with @xmath212 km / s by @xcite ; however , one should bear in mind the caveats discussed in section [ sec : obsns ] . for bhs , the number of sources with measured 3d space velocity ( @xmath19 ; see @xcite )",
    "is not sufficient to allow for a calibration of their nk distribution .",
    "when comparing the observed bh - xrbs with the synthetic bh - xrbs which result from our population synthesis , we found that the population in which bhs receive high nks best fit the observed data .",

    "we build a population of binaries which evolve into long - period ns - xrbs along the lines of the computational method used for long - period bh - xrbs ( see section [ sec : bps ] ) .",
    "we find that the long - period systems have slightly lower peculiar velocities , which results in a slightly lower scale height ( by a factor of @xmath217 , for every radial distance ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the binary , having lower binding energy , can only survive lower kicks .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , there is evidence for some nss receiving low kicks at birth : nss residing in double - ns systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and nss hosted in a subset of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that electron - capture sne are too fast for large asymmetries to develop , resulting in a modest kick , of a few @xmath176 km / s at maximum .",
    "such kicks are of the order of the low natal kick model we took in our binary population synthesis of section [ sec : bps ] through which we found ( section [ sec : obsns ] ) that high - kick models best fit the galactic distribution of ns - lmxbs : i.e. we did not find any evidence for nss born in an electron - capture sn",
    ". this might be due to a different evolutionary path for the progenitors of ns - lmxbs .",
    "several studies have investigated the type of sn event ( either a standard collapse of the iron core or an electron capture sn ) as a function of the evolutionary state of the helium star progenitor of the ns as well as the characteristics of the binary orbit .",
    "@xcite performed detailed evolutionary sequences of binaries hosting an ns and a helium star .",
    "they found that helium stars with an initial mass of @xmath218 could be stripped of a significant fraction of their mass through case bb mass transfer towards an ns companion when the helium star expands as a giant .",
    "the low - mass core would then form an ns via electron - capture sn , provided the initial orbital period is sufficiently wide .",
    "shorter orbital period would instead result in a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "we can extrapolate this finding to the short - period systems formed by an ns and a low - mass companion studied in our work .",
    "however , we must bear in mind that the stripping effect is less understood for a giant helium star experiencing mass transfer to a low - mass main - sequence star , as indeed mentioned by @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that , heretofore , there is no strong theoretical support for a preference for electron - capture sn in the progenitors of ns - lmxbs .",
    "we also wish to note that the study by @xcite highlighted the impossibility of forming short - period ( less than one day ) ns - lmxbs without large natal kicks at birth ( where for large they chose a maxwellian distribution with an average kick of 300 km / s ) .      in assessing the quality of the fit of our simulations , we used the classical application of the ks - test . in order to test its validity and determine the _ power _ of the test in distinguishing the two hypothesis we draw samples of various sizes from the simulated populations , and we calculate the @xmath188-value distribution of each of these samples , according to the rules described in section  [ s : rules_for_cumul ] .",
    "we find that the probabilities follow the classical ks test ( as expected ) to an accuracy ( @xmath219 ) that is comparable to the poisson noise in our simulations ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "more interesting is the measurement of how often we obtain @xmath188-values smaller then the ones we measured for our observed samples when _ testing the wrong hypothesis _",
    "- i.e. when using a sample drawn from the high ( low ) nk synthetic population and testing the low ( high ) nk hypothesis ( also known as false negative rate ) .",
    "for the bh case , we find @xmath188-values smaller than the ones in table [ tab : dvalues ] in less than @xmath221 of the cases , for the high nk hypothesis , and in more than @xmath222 for the low nk hypothesis .",
    "a particularly interesting fact is that @xmath223 for short - period confirmed + candidate bh - xrbs .",
    "if we accept the @xmath224 confidence level and use the standard 4-to-1 weighting ( i.e. @xmath225 ) , the test we developed has enough power to distinguish between the high- and low - nk hypothesis in this case , and that the high - nk hypothesis is clearly preferable .",
    "this is a _ non_-expected result given the small number of object , and it can potentially dissolve if some of the bh candidates turn out to be ns - xrbs . to calculate what is the optimal number of observed systems to decrease such rate @xmath226 , we draw samples of various sizes from the population synthesis results of model 1 and we test the low - nk hypothesis , and vice - versa . to decrease this rate to the level that in @xmath42 of cases we obtain @xmath227 , we find that it is necessary to increase the size of the observed sample to @xmath3 systems , both in the bh and ns case .",
    "in this work we performed a binary population synthesis study of bh- and ns - xrbs , tracing their binary evolution from the moment of compact object formation until the observed phase of mass transfer , and integrated their orbits in the galaxy .",
    "the main goal was to investigate whether different assumptions on compact object formation manifest themselves in the galactic distribution of the binaries .",
    "we found that these assumptions do affect the scale height of the binaries , which we quantified through their @xmath178 .",
    "in particular , we found that if bhs and nss receive the same nk at birth , nss would still have a larger scale height above the galactic plane , due to the fact that their systemic velocities acquired when the compact object is formed are typically larger , their total binary mass being smaller .",
    "the larger scale height of ns - xrbs with respect to bh - xrbs is clearly seen also in the observed populations .",
    "we also found a clear trend for both populations of increasing scale height for larger galactocentric radii , which should manifest itself , but which is not clearly observed in the current populations ( see figure [ fig : space ] ) .",
    "the main outcome of this study is that when analysing the @xmath0-distribution of the observed bh systems as a function of @xmath26 , the simulated population in which at least some bhs receive a ( relatively ) high nk ( @xmath228 km / s ) fits the data best .",
    "this is in agreement with previous findings by @xcite , who compared the observed and simulated populations of bh - xrbs only in the @xmath0-direction , whereas we compare the 2d distributions , accounting for how the binaries are distributed along the @xmath26-direction as well .",
    "furthermore , we increased the sample of sources adding @xmath229 bh candidates , updated their distances according to the recently published bh catalogue of , and followed the binary evolution of the binaries in a detailed way ( accounting in particular for magnetic braking and tides ) .    in this work",
    "we also checked numerically the validity of a simple one - dimensional analytical estimate for the peculiar velocity at birth of bh - xrbs which we used in our previous works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that this estimate is less reliable for some gravitational potentials for sources in the bulge of the galaxy , i.e at @xmath230 kpc .",
    "this was also shown by @xcite , who studied the kinematics of h 1705 - 250 , a bh - xrb close to the galactic bulge . however , the estimate is robust for systems at galactocentric radii larger than @xmath25 kpc .",
    "@xcite followed the binary evolution of seven short - period bh - xrbs and estimated their minimal peculiar velocity at birth , to conclude that two out of the seven sources were consistent with a high ( or relatively high ) nk at birth .",
    "this conclusion remains valid even in view of the current analysis .",
    "@xcite found that the rms - value of the distance to the galactic plane for bh - xrbs was similar to that of ns - xrbs .",
    "this was suggestive for bhs receiving a kick - velocity at formation .",
    "we revised the distances and updated the sample of bh - xrbs using the catalogue from and we found that ns systems have a larger scale height than bh systems , a trait which is also present in the simulated populations .    finally , we found that the comparison of the data to our simulations is limited by the small number of observed bh - xrbs , and thus that more systems should be found to determine in more detail the nk that bhs receive . in this respect , the possible future discovery of new bh transients with gaia ( @xcite ) , and through dedicated surveys such as the galactic bulge survey ( @xcite ) , are promising .",

    "<S> the aim of this work is to study the imprints that different models for black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) formation have on the galactic distribution of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) which contain these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the root mean square of the height above the galactic plane of bh- and ns - xrbs is a powerful proxy to discriminate among different formation scenarios , and that binary evolution following the bh / ns formation does not significantly affect the galactic distributions of the binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a population model in which at least some bhs receive a ( relatively ) high natal kick fits the observed bh - xrbs best . </S>",
    "<S> for the ns case , we find that a high nk distribution , consistent with the one derived from the measurement of pulsar proper motion , is the most preferable . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse the simple method we previously used to estimate the minimal peculiar velocity of an individual bh - xrb at birth . </S>",
