    "the presence of complex molecules , with typical spectral properties , can be used to precisely probe the environments in which they reside and provide a fairly faithful history of ism molecular clouds .",
    "ir emission lines ( in the range of 3 - 14 @xmath0 m ) have been assigned to c - c and c - h vibration bands of a broad class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest pah , naphthalene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) has been found in carbonaceous chondrites @xcite , suggesting extraterrestrial origin .",
    "although no specific pah molecule has yet been unambiguously identified in space , the infrared emission bands have been observed in nearly all astronomical objects , from highly ionized hii regions to ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",

    "moreover , a large class of unsolved mysteries in astronomy , such as diffuse interstellar bands ( dib ) @xcite , extended red emission ( ere ) @xcite , and the @xmath9   bump \" @xcite trace their origins to large carbon and/or carbonaceous molecules .",
    "single and multi - layer graphene have strong plasmon excitation bumps in the vicinity of the @xmath9  feature @xcite",
    ". however , more work in needed to establish potential connection between these spectral features in astrophysical conditions .",
    "these challenges can not be solved without a strong theoretical input .",
    "development of a comprehensive and detailed theoretical models for the origin and evolution of complex organic molecules such as pahs , fullerenes , and other ordered carbon structures may be crucially important for understanding of the role that prebiotic molecules played on early earth .",
    "most theoretical studies of formation of larger aromatic carbon chains , rings , and cages in ism have been done close to equilibrium and at relatively high particle densities .",
    "naphthalene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) was shown to be potentially formed in ism via a barrierless reaction of phenyl radical ( c@xmath10h@xmath11 ) and vinylacetylene ( c@xmath12h@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that c@xmath7 in ism can form in a top - down manner in successive de - hydrogenation of pahs into graphene @xcite , and formation of defects ( pentagons ) necessary for the synthesis of c@xmath7 .",
    "there are a number of issues associated with this hypothesis of c@xmath7 formation : 1 ) the circumstellar environment of tc1 planetary nebula is distinctly hydrogen poor , 2 ) graphene is only synthesized in the laboratory and is not believed to exist in ism , and 3 ) the proposed formation of carbon cages in ism ( via the 6 to 5 member rings ) was observed in the laboratory only at far from equilibrium conditions .    to our knowledge",
    ", there are no available dynamical simulations of formation of molecules with aromatic rings at astrophysically - relevant conditions , which are not even properly known .",
    "orderly growth of planar carbon structures ( hexagon rings ) from precursor c@xmath13 molecules necessitates low - temperature conditions , where vibrational distortions of the structures during their growth are minimized @xcite . under such conditions no significantly curved ( cage - like ) structures are supposed to form @xcite .",
    "fast inflow of carbon material is needed to form curved carbon clusters and fullerenes ( pentagon rings , ring - stacks , ring fusion ) . in the laboratory , fullerenes are created with remarkable efficiency ( @xmath14 % in a condensing carbon arc ) under less understood far from equilibrium conditions .    in this work ,",
    "we describe an approach to equilibrium by simulating tenuous carbon ( and hydrogen ) gas dynamics to exceeding long times .",
    "different carbon molecular clusters and moieties which form represent steady state local equilibria and are important yardsticks for understanding future time dynamics and equilibration in astrophysical time .",
    "we would like to understand the nucleation and stabilization of carbon chains , rings , and cages of different sizes and moieties in regimes relevant to astrophysics ( cold temperatures and low densities ) , which are orders of magnitude more dilute than those considered under laboratory conditions @xcite .",
    "however , performing such simulations in gaseous conditions , resembling an ism , is a highly challenging task . since the cluster formation times",
    "are long and the systems are large , we can not reasonably investigate them by first principle molecular dynamics methods , unless we focus only on equilibrium structures ; for example , fullerene forms by laser irradiation or arc - discharge methods within one ms to several seconds . by increasing the density of carbon atoms",
    ", we can effectively compress the nucleation time .",
    "however , this time compression enhances the growth and dissociation of the formed clusters due to collisions .",
    "moreover , it dramatically alters the entropic contribution to the cluster gibbs energy and thus influences the cluster form and stability .    here",
    ", we use semiclassical reactive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to model the formation of clusters starting from an elementary carbon ( and hydrogen ) gas . to proceed with the simulations , we need to know the reactive force fields , characterized by appropriate potential functions describing the change of atom hybridization over time .",
    "we use an approximate description of the chemical bonds , and propose analytical fit formulae for the structure formation times .",
    "we apply the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond - order ( airebo ) potential function proposed by stuart @xcite , based on the brenner bond - order potential @xcite .",
    "this potential can be used for chemical reactions and intermolecular interactions in condensed - phase hydrocarbon systems such as liquids , graphite , and polymers .",
    "the potential function is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are repulsive and attractive pairwise potentials between atoms @xmath18 and @xmath19 , separated by @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the bond - order term in a tersoff - type potential @xcite .",
    "the dispersion and intermolecular interaction ( @xmath22 ) are modeled with a lennard - jones ( lj ) 12 - 6 potential having a switching function and a connectivity switch @xcite .",
    "the torsional potential ( @xmath23 ) is proportional to bond weights that contribute to the dihedral angle @xcite .",
    "we model the self - assembly of clusters from c and/or h atom gases using atomistic reactive md simulations with the airebo potential @xcite as implemented in the lammps package @xcite .",
    "the systems are modeled in the nvt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions applied .",
    "the langevin damping method @xcite with a damping coefficient of @xmath24 ps@xmath25 is used to thermalize the systems ; the time step is @xmath26 fs . visualization and analysis of the trajectories are done by vmd @xcite .",
    "the simulations are progressively more computational expensive with increasing temperatures , as finer time steps are required ( scaling is linear with temperature ) .",
    "for instance , it takes @xmath27 hours to simulate @xmath28 c atoms at @xmath29 k for a @xmath30 ns simulation time on a @xmath31-core machine with 2.6 ghz amd opteron processors .",
    "for the same reason higher temperature ( @xmath32 k ) systems are simulated for upto @xmath33 ns .",
    "evidence from theoretical studies suggests that high temperatures are required to transform a flat structure to a curved moiety @xcite .",
    "we examine in our simulations the type of structures that are formed at different temperatures and gas densities .",
    "first , we simulate the nucleation of carbon clusters at different temperatures ( @xmath34 k ) .",
    "we place @xmath35 atoms in a box of @xmath36 nm@xmath37 , giving a carbon particle density of @xmath38 @xmath39 . in the md simulations ,",
    "the system energy is first minimized for a short time ( @xmath40 ps ) . in most implementations of md algorithm ,",

    "after @xmath45 ns , nearly all structures are cages .",
    "although in our simulations ( small systems ) , all carbon atoms form curved structures , for a much bigger system at the same density and at high temperature , predominantly smaller carbon clusters along with few planar and curved moieties form when the system is in or close to equilibrium ( see distribution of cluster sizes section ) .    at @xmath32",

    "long chains can be stabilized at lower temperatures .",
