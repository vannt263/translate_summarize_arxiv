    "observing extra solar planets transiting their host stars has become an important tool for planet detection and is used to obtain and constrain fundamental system parameters : the inclination has to be close to @xmath0 , while the planet to star radius ratio is constrained mainly by the transit depth . also , in combination with spectroscopy , the semimajor axis and the absolute planet and star radii can be obtained as well .",
    "several years ago , when the first results of the _ kepler _ mission were published ( see @xcite for first scientific results , @xcite for an instrument description ) , studying the transit timing became one of the standard techniques in the analysis of transit observations . since space based missions are able to observe many consecutive transit events with a high precision , one can detect even small variations of the transit intervals indicating deviations from a strictly keplerian motion and thus yet hidden planets in the observed system .",
    "furthermore , with the discovery of multi - planetary systems , transit timing variations ( ttvs ) are used to find the masses of the companions without the need of radial velocity measurements due to the influence of planetary interaction on ttvs .",
    "since many planet candidates found in photometric surveys are too faint for radial velocity follow - up even with bigger telescopes , ttv analyses can be considered as a photometric work - around to estimate masses .    although the existence of ttvs can be shown in already known exoplanetary systems , only a few additional planet candidates have been found using ttvs so far ( for recent examples of a proposed additional body indicated by ttv analyses see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is not suprising , since large bodies often can be found using radial velocity measurements or direct transit detections , while small ( e.g. earth - like ) objects result in small ttv amplitudes and therefore high precision timing measurements are needed .",
    "these measurements can already be acquired with medium size ground - based telescopes .",
    "commonly the transit mid - time of each observation is plotted into an observed minus calculated ( o  c ) diagram @xcite , where the difference between the observed transit mid - time and the mid - time obtained using the initial ephemeris is shown versus the observing epoch .",
    "in such a diagram remaining slopes indicate a wrong orbital period , while e.g. periodic deviations from a linear trend indicate perturbing forces .    besides the discovery of small planets , the amount of known massive planets on close - in orbits increased as well .",
    "first studies on a larger sample of planet candidates detected with _ kepler",
    "_ suggest that hot giant planets exist in single planet systems only @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite analysed a larger sample of _ kepler _ hot jupiters and found a few cases where ttvs can not be explained by other causes ( e.g. artificial sampling effects due to the observing cadence ) but the existence of perturbers  additional planets or even exo - moons  in the respective system .",
    "in addition @xcite point toward the planet candidates koi-338 , koi-94 and koi-1241 who are all hot jupiters in multi - planetary systems , as well as the hat - p-13 system with a hot jupiter accompanied by a massive planet on an eccentric outer orbit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the wasp-12 system with a proposed companion candidate found by ttv analysis @xcite .",
    "the origin of those planets is yet not fully understood .",
    "one possible formation scenario shows that close - in giant planets could have migrated inwards after their creation further out @xcite . in that case ,",
    "inner and close outer planets would have either been thrown out of the system , or caught in resonance . in the latter case ,",
    "even small perturbing masses , e.g. earth - mass objects , can result in ttv amplitudes in the order of several minutes ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "though _ kepler _ is surveying many of those systems , it is necessary to look at the most promising candidates among all close - in giant planets discovered so far , including stars outside the field of view of _ kepler_. in our ongoing study of ttvs in exoplanetary systems we perform photometric follow - up observations of specific promising transiting planets where additional bodies are expected .",
    "the targets are selected by the following criteria :    * the orbital solution of the known transiting planet shows non - zero eccentricity ( though the circularization time - scale is much shorter than the system age ) and/or deviant radial velocity ( rv ) data points  both possibly indicating a perturber . * the brightness of the host star is @xmath1mag and the transit depth is at least @xmath2mmag to ensure sufficient photometric and timing precision at 1 - 2 m class ground - based telescopes . *",
    "the target is visible from the northern hemisphere . *",
    "the target has not been studied for ttv signals before .    in the past",
    "the transiting exoplanets wasp-12b @xcite , wasp-3b @xcite , wasp-10b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maciejewski et al .",
    "2014 in prep . ) , wasp-14b @xcite , tres-2 @xcite , and hat - p-32b @xcite have been studied by our group in detail . in most cases , except for wasp-12b , no ttvs could be confirmed .    here , we extend our investigations to search for ttvs in the hat - p-18 , hat - p-19 , hat - p-27/wasp-40 and wasp-21 planetary systems . in section",
    "[ sec : targets ] we give a short description of the targets analysed within this project . section  [ sec : dataaquisitionandreduction ] explains the principles of data acquisition and reduction and gives an overview of the telescopes used for observation .",
    "the modeling procedures are described in section  [ sec : analyses ] , followed by the results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] gives a summary of our project .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all data has been reduced in a standard way by applying dark / bias and flat field corrections using iraf .",
    "the respective calibration images have been obtained in the same night and with the same focus as the scientific observations .",
    "this is necessary especially if the pointing of the telescope is not stable .",
    "when using calibration images obtained with different foci , patterns remain in the images that lead to distortions in the light curve .    besides our own observations , we also use literature data .",
    "this involves data from the respective discovery papers mentioned in section  [ sec : targets ] , as well as data from @xcite in case of hat - p-18b , @xcite in case of hat - p-27b , @xcite and @xcite for wasp-21b , and @xcite for wasp-38b .",
    "the light curve extraction and modelling is performed analogous to the procedure described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the julian date of each image is calculated from the header information of the start of the exposure and the exposure time . to precisely determine the mid - time of the transit event these informations have to be stored most accurate .",
    "the reliability of the final light curve model thus also depends on a precise time synchronization of the telescope computer system .",
    "observing transits with multiple telescopes at the same time enables to look for synchronization errors which would otherwise lead to artifacts in the o ",
    "c diagram ( as shown for hat - p-27b in epoch 415 , see section  [ subsec : ergh27 ] ) .",
    "we use differential aperture photometry to extract the light curve from the reduced images by measuring the brightness of all bright stars in the field with routines provided by iraf .",
    "the typical aperture radius is @xmath3 times the mean full width half maximum of all stars in the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the best fitting aperture is found by manually varying the aperture radius by a few pixels to minimize the photometric scatter .",
    "the final light curve is created by comparing the star of interest against an artificial standard star composed of the ( typically 15 - 30 ) brightest stars in the fov weighted by their respective constantness as introduced by @xcite .",
    "the final photometric errors are based on the instrumental iraf measurement errors .",
    "the error of the constant comparison stars are rescaled by their photometric scatter using shared scaling factors in order to achieve a mean @xmath4 for all comparison stars .",
    "the error bars of the transit star are rescaled afterwards using the same scaling factors ( for further details on the procedure see * ? ? ?",
    "due to atmospheric and air - mass effects transit light curves show trends .",
    "they can impact the determination of transit parameters . to eliminate such effects we start the observation about 1 hour before and finish about 1 hour after the transit itself .",
    "thus we can detrend the observations by fitting a second order polynomial to the out - of - transit data .      to model the light curves we used the transit analysis package ( tap ; * ? ? ?",
    "the modelling of the transit light curve is done by using the exofast routines @xcite with the light curve model of @xcite . for error estimation tap",
    "uses markov chain monte carlo simulations ( in our case 10 times 10@xmath5 mcmc chains ) together with wavelet - based likelihood functions @xcite .",
    "the coefficients for the quadratic limb darkening ( ld ) law used by tap are taken from the exofast / quadld - routine of @xcite that linearly interpolates the ld tables of @xcite .    for comparison",
    "we also use jktebop ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) which is based on the ebop code for eclipsing binaries @xcite . to compare the results with those obtained with tap",
    ", we only use a quadratic ld law which is sufficient for ground - based data . for error estimation we used monte carlo simulations ( @xmath6 runs ) , bootstrapping ( @xmath6 data sets ) , and a residual shift method as provided by jktebop .    as input values",
    "we use the system properties presented in the respective discovery papers ( see table  [ tab : allinputvalues ] for a summary ) . for both light curve fitting procedures we took the original light curve as well as",
    "a threefold binned one .",
    "though the binned light curves result in a lower rms of the fit , no better timing result can be achieved due to a longer cadence .    as free parameters we use the mid - transit time @xmath7 , inclination @xmath8 , and planet to star radius ratio @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the planet and stellar radius scaled by the semimajor axis , respectively ) . in case of tap the inverse fractional stellar radius @xmath12 , in case of jktebop the sum of the fractional radii @xmath13",
    "is fitted as well .",
    "both quantities are an expression of the transit duration and can be transformed into each other according to the following equation : @xmath14 the fitting procedure is applied two times . first keeping the limb darkening coefficients fixed at their theoretical values , and afterwards letting them vary . for tap",
    "we set the fitting interval to @xmath15 . in case of jktebop",
    "we use the option to set the ld coefficients fixed for the initial model , but let them being perturbed for the error estimation .",
    "thus the fitted model does not change , but the error bars are increased .",
    "the eccentricity was fixed to zero for all our analyses .    since all data are obtained using jd@xmath16 as time base , we transform the fitted mid - transit times to bjd@xmath17 afterwards using the online converter provided by jason eastman ( for a detailed description of the barycentric dynamical time see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , we derive the photometric noise rate ( pnr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a quality marker for all light curves , which is defined as the ratio between the root mean square of the model fit and the number of data points per minute . for further analysis we took data with @xmath18 into account",
    "for every light curve we get six different models , four from tap ( for the binned and unbinned data with the ld coefficients fixed and free ) and two from jktebop ( for the binned and unbinned data , ld coefficients set free for error estimation only ) . to get one final result we averaged those six results . as for the errors",
    ", we got four different estimations from tap and 12 from jktebop . as final error value",
    ", we took the maximum of either the largest of the error estimates , or the spread of the model fit results to use a conservative error estimate .",
    "it has to be noted , though , that the spread between the different models has always been below size of the error bars .",
    "binning the light curve threefold using an error weighted mean in principle still leaves enough data points during ingress and egress to be able to fit the transit model to the data while reducing the error bar of an individual measurement .",
    "however , comparing the results of the threefold binned and unbinned data we do not see significant differences , neither in the fitted values , nor in the error bars .    the same counts for the differences between the tap models obtained with fixed ld values and those obtained with the ld coefficients set free to fit .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the influence of the ld model on transit light curves see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for hat - p-18b we obtained five transit light curves ( see fig  [ fig : h18_erg ] ) .",
    "all light curves show some features which could be caused by stellar activity , e.g. spots .",
    "however , the quality of the data does not allow to draw further conclusion .",
    "moreover , there is only a small number of suitable comparison stars available in the respective fov of each observation , hence this could also be an artificial effect .",
    "except for one  but not significant  outlier the differences in the o  c diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : h18_erg ] ) can be explained by redetermining the published period by @xmath19s .",
    "hence we find a slightly larger period compared to the originally proposed period of @xcite .",
    "regarding the transit depth , and thus the planet to star radius ratio , we do not see any changes .",
    "however , having a look at the data provided in the exoplanet transit database ( etd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) one can see that the values for the transit depth reported there vary by several tens of mmag .",
    "such transit depth variations can be caused by close variable stellar companions placed within the aperture due to the pixel scale of our detectors and the defocussing of the telescopes .",
    "thus we took a more detailed look at the long term variability of the parent star . over a timespan of 12 months we obtained 3 images in four bands ( b ,",
    "v , r , i ) in each clear night using the jena 0.6 m telescope . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monitoring_h18 ] , the mean variation of the r band brightness is @xmath20mmag taking the individual error bar of the measurements into account .",
    "however , this variation is too small to be responsible for the seen transit depth variations .",
    "the monitoring of the remaining bands is not shown but leads to a similar result . having a closer look at the light curves listed for hat - p-18b in etd",
    ", one can see that a large number is of lower quality .",
    "this is especially true for those light curves responsible for the spread in the tabulated transit depth .",
    "taking only the higher quality data into account the spread is much smaller .",
    "depending on the quality cut the variation can even reach the order of the error bars of the measurements .",
    "thus we believe that the transit depth variation is negligible .    despite a spread in the data , which can be explained by the quality of the light curves , we do not see any significant difference for @xmath21 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 between the respective observations .",
    "a summary of all obtained parameters can be found in table  [ tab : allnewproperties ] at the end of the paper , as well as a comparison with literature values .      for hat - p-19b we got two light curves using the jena 0.6 m and one light curve from the caha 1.2 m telescope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h19_erg ] ) . in all three cases we obtained high precision data .",
    "the light curves show no artifacts that could be ascribed to e.g. spots on the stellar surface . plotting the mid - transit times into the o ",
    "c diagram , we can redetermine the period by @xmath23s . as for the inclination and the reverse fractional stellar radius we can confirm the values reported in @xcite",
    ". the radius ratio of @xmath24 , however , seems to be smaller than assumed by @xcite ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "hat - p-27b planetary transits were observed six times .",
    "an advantage of a network such as yeti lies within the possibility of simultaneous observations using different telescopes .",
    "this enables us to independently check whether the data is reliable . for hat - p-27b simultaneous observations",
    "could be achieved at epoch 415 using two different telescopes ( antalya 1.0 m and osn 1.5 m ) .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : h27_erg ] the best - fitting transit shapes differ . since some data has been acquired using small telescopes under unfavorable conditions",
    ", this might be an artificial effect .",
    "however , these shape variations can also be seen in the literature data . while @xcite fitted a flat bottom to the transit they observed",
    ", the transit of @xcite shows a rather roundish bottom and so does the @xcite transit . both @xcite and @xcite claim ,",
    "a roundish bottom is in good agreement with a grazing transit .",
    "our most precise transit light curve of hat - p-27b at epoch 415 the osn 1.5 m telescope also shows no flat bottom .",
    "thus , we would agree with the previous authors that the planet is grazing .",
    "the epoch 540 observations also shows a v - shape .",
    "however , due to a connection problem parts of the ingress data is missing , thus precise fits of the transit parameters are not possible .",
    "in addition to our own data we added data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter one only lists system parameters without giving an epoch of observation , thus we artificially put them to epoch 200 . since we do not see any systematic trend in the remaining data , this does not effect the conclusion on the system parameters but improves the precision of the constant fit .",
    "the system parameters @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath21 can be determined more precisely than before taking the errors of the individual measurements into account .",
    "all three parameters are in good agreement with the results of previous authors .",
    "furthermore , we do not see any significant variation .",
    "the larger @xmath21-value of the epoch 540 observations are due to the quality of the corresponding light curve .",
    "looking at the mid - transit time we see that a period change of @xmath27s explains the data quite well .",
    "the mid - transit time of one of the epoch 415 observations was found to be @xmath28min ahead of time , while the other one is as predicted . this way we could identify a synchronization error during one of the observations .",
    "this example shows the importance of simultaneous transit observations .",
    "unfortunately this was the only sucessful observation of that kind within this project ( for a larger set of double and threefold observations see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "four transit light curves of wasp-21b are available , including one light curve from @xcite ( see fig.[fig : w21_erg ] ) .",
    "in addition , the results of the analysis of two transit events of @xcite and one transit observation of @xcite are also taken into account . concerning the o ",
    "c diagram , we found that a period change of @xmath29s removes the linear trend which is present in the data fitted with the initial ephemeris .",
    "as in the previous analyses no trend or sinusoidal variation in the system parameters can be seen .",
    "however , regarding inclination and reverse fractional stellar radius we do see a significant difference between our results and the initial values published by @xcite .",
    "this was also found by other authors before . as discussed in @xcite",
    "this result is a consequence of the assumption of @xcite that the planet host star is a main sequence star , while @xcite found that the star starts evolving off the main sequence and thus its radius increases .",
    "this in turn leads to corrections of the stellar and hence planetary properties .",
    "we presented the results of the transit observations of the extra solar planets hat - p-18b , hat - p-19b , hat - p-27b / wasp-40b and wasp-21b which are part of our ongoing project on gound - based follow - up observations of exoplanetary transits using small to medium sized telescopes with the help of yeti network telescopes . during the past three years we followed these",
    "well chosen objects to refine their orbital parameters as well as to find transit timing variations indicating yet unknown planetary companions .",
    "table  [ tab : allnewproperties ] contains an overview of the redetermined properties , as well as the available literature values , while table  [ tab : fitresults ] lists the results of the individual light curve fits .    in all cases",
    "we could redetermine the orbital parameters .",
    "especially the period could be determined more precise than before .",
    "so far , we can not rule out the existence of ttv signals for the planets investigated within this study due to the limited number of available high quality data .",
    "also the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath30 and inclination have been obtained and compared to the available literature data . despite some corrections to the literature data , we found no significant variations within these parameters . to distinguish between a real astrophysical source of the remaining scatter and random noise as a result of the quality of our data more high precision transit observations would be needed .",
    "hat - p-18b was also part of an out - of - transit monitoring for a spread in the transit depth was reported in the literature that could be due to a significant variability of the transit host star .",
    "regarding our transit data we can not confirm the spread in transit depth .",
    "looking at the quality of the literature data showing the transit depth variation , it is very likely that this spread is of artificial nature .",
