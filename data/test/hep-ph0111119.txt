    "to be able to fully describe hadrons from first principles in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , one needs to be able to compute wave functions and spectra .",
    "progress toward making such a computation in the context of light - cone quantization has been steady  @xcite .",
    "two particular approaches will be discussed here . both make use of the discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) technique pioneered by pauli and brodsky  @xcite for the numerical solution of quantum field theories .",
    "the approaches differ in how the theory is regulated ; one uses pauli  villars ( pv ) regularization  @xcite and the other supersymmetry .",
    "the use of pv regularization with dlcq in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional theories has been developed by brodsky , hiller , and mccartor  @xcite .",
    "the initial work involved simple many - body models  @xcite .",
    "new work discussed here and elsewhere  @xcite is for yukawa theory in a single - fermion truncation .",
    "the essential idea is to include pv particles in the dlcq basis .",
    "cancellation of ultraviolet infinities is then arranged by choosing imaginary couplings or an indefinite metric . in the case of yukawa theory",
    "there are choices to be made about the particle content of the pv sector .",
    "the work to be discussed here used three heavy scalars , two of which have negative norm .",
    "an alternative now under investigation is to use one heavy scalar and one heavy fermion , both with negative norm .",
    "this alternative was suggested by the work of paston _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and has the advantage of being free of instantaneous fermion interactions .",
    "supersymmetric theories are simpler with respect to regularization but require greater care in the numerical discretization .",
    "a key insight to the correct discretization was made by matsumura , sakai , and sakai  @xcite .",
    "they noticed that by discretizing the supercharge @xmath0 and constructing a discrete light - cone energy @xmath1 from the superalgebra , one could retain supersymmetry in the discrete approximation , now called sdlcq  @xcite .",
    "ordinary dlcq discretizes @xmath1 directly and recovers supersymmetry only in the infinite resolution limit .",
    "the sdlcq technique has been refined and applied by pinsky and collaborators  @xcite , initially in 1 + 1 dimensions , but now also in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recent work on ( 2 + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory is discussed here and elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "both approaches rely on dlcq .",
    "all light - cone momentum variables are discretized , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in terms of longitudinal and transverse length scales @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the integrals over wave functions that make up the mass eigenvalue problem @xmath6 are then approximated by the trapezoidal quadrature rule .",
    "this yields a matrix eigenvalue problem which is typically quite large but also quite sparse .",
    "lanczos techniques  @xcite are used to extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the lowest states , even in the case of an indefinite metric  @xcite .    because the longitudinal momentum is always positive",
    ", there exists a positive integer @xmath7 , called the ( harmonic ) resolution  @xcite , such that the total longitudinal momentum is @xmath8 and momentum fractions are given by @xmath9 .",
    "wave functions and the mass eigenvalue problem , where @xmath10 , are naturally expressed in terms of momentum fractions and the resolution @xmath7 .",
    "hence @xmath4 disappears , and @xmath7 effectively takes its place as the resolution scale .",
    "the transverse scale @xmath5 is set by a momentum cutoff and a transverse resolution .",

    "in addition to supersymmetry , we have transverse parity and the kutasov @xmath46 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the mass eigenvalue problem can then be solved separately in each of the 8 symmetry sectors . in the largest calculation to date  @xcite , each sector contained roughly 230,000 basis states .",
    "a variety of results can be seen in ref .",
    "they include a number of studies of the coupling dependence of the mass values , as well as outcomes for structure functions .",
    "one striking feature is that , except for weak coupling , the average particle count for almost all eigenstates is at or near the maximum allowed by the resolution , even for the highest resolution considered .",
    "this means that for strong coupling the method does not capture all of the important pieces of the true eigenstate .",
    "such behavior is likely to be a consequence of dealing with massless constituents without introducing a mass scale through symmetry breaking or other means .",
    "another striking feature is that the average number of fermions in bosonic states has been observed to have a gap between 4 and 6 .",
    "this could only be checked for resolutions where a full diagonalization could be done . however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:<nf > ] , the signal is quite clean for @xmath47 and 3 transverse momentum modes , where the average number is never above 4 unless it is precisely 6 , the maximum allowed ; below 4 there are no gaps at all .",
    "both ordinary dlcq with pauli  villars particles and sdlcq provide the means to compute masses and wave functions for eigenstates in multi - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "these methods will continue to be explored in various contexts , leading eventually to consideration of ( supersymmetric ) qcd .",
    "in fact , paston _",
    "et al_.  @xcite have already obtained a pv - like regularization of qcd that could , in principle , be solved by dlcq ; however , with present computing power the number of fields is probably too large for meaningful calculations .",
    "with qcd as a goal , work on the pv approach will next turn to the alternative regularization of yukawa theory , with one heavy scalar and one heavy fermion  @xcite , in both the one and two - fermion fock sectors .",
    "quantum electrodynamics will also be considered , as a first application to a gauge theory and as something of interest in its own right .",
    "the next step for work with sdlcq is to include a chern ",
    "simons term in super yang  mills theory and thereby give each constituent a nonzero mass .",
    "the extension of the method to 3 + 1 dimensions is also important , as is consideration of supersymmetry breaking .",
