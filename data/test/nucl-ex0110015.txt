    "the yields of the heavy residues @xcite , i.e. , the large remnants of the heavy member of an asymmetric reacting pair of nuclei , are known to comprise a large fraction of the reaction cross section for intermediate energy nuclear collisions . however , there are experimental difficulties in studying the formation of these nuclei in asymmetric reactions using `` normal '' kinematics . the energies of the residues are low ( @xmath415 kev / nucleon @xcite ) and the masses are large . experimental thresholds cause one to miss substantial portions ( @xmath550% ) of the product distributions @xcite",
    ". one can overcome the problem of detecting low fragment energies by studying these asymmetric reactions in `` inverse kinematics '' , i.e. , bombard a low mass nucleus with a large mass nucleus . by using a high resolution spectrometer / detector system to observe the projectile - like fragments ( plfs ) from such reactions",

    "previous studies @xcite , @xcite of the collisions of heavier nuclei at intermediate energies have shown binary dissipative collisions to be the dominant reaction mechanism .",

    "a variety of phenomenological models have been used , with modest success , to describe these collisions @xcite .",
    "the goal of this extension of previous work is to understand quantitatively the reaction mechanism(s ) responsible for residue formation in more symmetric collisions at 20 mev / nucleon .",
    "we shall present evidence indicating that , in addition to the traditional evaporation residues from peripheral collisions , some residues are formed in `` hard '' collisions , possibly resulting from very asymmetric fission and/or imf emission .",
    "the distributions of these residues , which are very proton - rich , can not be fully described by available phenomenological models of these collisions .",
    "although the au + zr reaction has not , to the best of our knowledge , been studied before , there are a large number of studies @xcite , @xcite of the analogous @xmath0au + kr reaction at intermediate energies ranging from 4.9 to 70 mev / nucleon with some studies @xcite at a beam energy of @xmath420 mev / nucleon .",

    "it should be noted that use of the a1200 for very asymmetric collisions with heavy beams ( where the grazing angle is small , i.e. 1 - 2@xmath9 @xcite ) , leads to rather efficient collection of the projectile residues ( that can reach 50% ) at this energy regime .",
    "however , using the a1200 for more symmetric systems , as for the au+zr reaction in this work ( where the grazing angle is 5.5@xmath9 ) , results in substantial loss of residue cross sections , since the measurements are performed near 0@xmath9 , while the residue cross sections are expected to peak at larger angles , close to the grazing angle . in this case , only a small fraction of the residue cross section can be collected ( of the order of a few percent ) . despite this limitation",

    "the measurement of the ionic charge q had a resolution of 0.7 and 0.5 q units for heavy and fission - like residues , respectively . since the ionic charge must be an integer , we assigned integer values of q for each event by setting appropriate windows on each peak of the q spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "using the magnetic rigidity and velocity measurement , the mass - to - charge a / q ratio of each ion was obtained from the expression : @xmath37 now , combining the q determination with the a / q measurement , the mass a was obtained as : @xmath38 ( q@xmath39 is the integer ionic charge determined as above ) with an overall resolution ( fwhm ) of 1.0 and 0.7 a units , again for heavy and fission - like residues respectively .",

    "for example , it was not possible to cleanly separate the beam nuclei from quasielastic fragments",

    "the second bump in the mass yield distribution consists of two groups of fragments ( as can be deduced with the aid of fig .",

    "the radiochemical centroids for near - au residues are close to stability due to the dominance of quasielastic events in this region . in the symmetric fission fragment region",
    "a=90120 , the centroids are in fair agreement with the present data , as they both correspond to fission fragments . in the region",

    "charity @xcite has recently discussed the concept of an `` evaporation residue attractor line''(eal ) .",
    "the eal is a line in the n  z plane that represents the locus of fragment yields produced by the evaporation of neutrons and charged particles from highly excited nuclei .",

    "1b , we show the position of the modified heavy fragment eal for the decay of highly excited heavy nuclei where the primary fragment is near the valley of beta stability .  as shown in this figure , the centroids of the observed yields are similar to the modified eal for this reaction ( a=80160 ) , but the slope of z vs a is not the same .",
    "this similarity in charge distributions for the products from the present reaction and the eal for a = 120160 indicates that these fragments are decay products of highly excited nuclei .    what causes the centroids of the contours in the data to become more n - rich compared to these two prescriptions as the fragment mass decreases ?",
    "a possible answer is the occurrence of fission which produces more n - rich fragments than fragmentation ( residue production ) .",
    "( the two empirical prescriptions @xcite do not include the effects of fission . )",
    "the argument is that at a=100 , a larger fraction of the fragments arise from fission ( fig .",
    "1c ) than at a=150 , thus producing the observed slope of z vs a. evidence for this comes from comparison with the z distributions measured radiochemically for the reaction of 20 mev / nucleon xe with au , where the fission of the au - like nucleus is more prominent ( fig .",
    "the observed centroids of the z distributions for this reaction are more n - rich than the fragments observed in this work .",
    "the definitive data comes from comparing fig .",
    "1b and 1c and noting that as fission ( high velocity events ) becomes more prominent , the charge distribution becomes more n - rich .",
    "one does note that the contours of the observed yields in fig .",
    "1b lie close to the position of the proton dripline ( plotted for odd z nuclei @xcite ) . some of the observed products have 57 more protons than the stable isobar . to examine this point further",

    "2 , an attempt has been made to correct the measured yields for the spectrometer angular acceptance , so that we may obtain estimates of fragment production cross sections , despite the fact that only a small fraction of the cross section was collected in the present measurements .",
    "correction factors for the angular distributions of the fission - like fragments ( a=90160 ) were obtained assuming isotropic binary decay of the primary reaction product . for simplicity , this product was assumed to be a au nucleus with velocity as this observed for the heavy residues ( which , as already mentioned , correspond to @xmath415% linear momentum transfer ) and was assumed to scatter off the target at an angle somewhat inside the grazing angle .",
    "( the grazing angle is 5.5@xmath54 degrees and the scatter angle was taken to be 4.0@xmath54 . )",
    "typical correction factors were 40 , 60 , 90 , 150 for masses a=160 , 140 , 120 , 100 , respectively .",
    "after applying mass - dependent correction factors to the measured yields , the resulting yields were normalized to values of cross sections of non - isomeric independent - yield nuclides from the radiochemical data of the reaction ( 21 mev / nucleon ) @xmath47xe+@xmath0au @xcite .",
    "fragment production cross sections resulted with an estimated uncertainty of a factor of 2 ( due to the correction procedure ) and , for several a values , are presented in fig .",
    "2 .    in examining fig .",
    "2 , we are struck by the large number of nuclide yields measured for each mass number a , when compared to typical radiochemical measurements where , at best , the yields of two or three isobars are measured for each a value .",
    "the measured distributions appear to be rather broad .",
    "the general proton - rich character of these yield distributions indicates that these intermediate energy collisions may be useful for the synthesis of heavy proton - rich nuclei , complementary to the usual practice of synthesizing these nuclei via symmetric compound nuclear reactions involving the pxn exit channel @xcite .",
    "an attempt to produce and identify proton emitting nuclei using the au+zr reaction is described in @xcite .    the velocity vs mass distributions ( fig .",
    "1c ) show the general absence of fusion - like collisions and the prevalence of dissipative collisions .",
    "as already mentioned , one also sees evidence for the occurrence of fission events for a=90120 with velocities higher than that of the beam , corresponding to fission fragments moving forward in the rest frame of the fissioning nucleus ( the spectrometer settings were such that only forward - moving fragments were collected from the two kinematical solutions ) .",
    "in addition , one sees a group of events ( a=120160 ) with rather constant velocity , lower than that of the beam ( by approx .",
    "5% ) corresponding to @xmath4 15% fractional linear momentum transfer ( flmt ) .",
    "the existence of a constant fragment velocity , roughly independent of fragment mass , is not consistent with fission , where the fragment velocity should be inversely correlated with the fragment mass ( as it is for a=90120 for the au - like fragment ) @xcite .",
    "we associate this group of fragments ( a=120160 ) mainly with residues that have emitted one or more imfs in accord with a recent radiochemical study of target - like residues from the @xmath55pb ( 29 mev / nucleon ) + @xmath0au reaction @xcite . from the velocity of this group of fragments ( relative to that of the beam ) we can estimate an average total kinetic energy loss of @xmath4350 mev .",
    "we also note in fig .",
    "1c , that the fragment group a=90120 , along with the fission fragments , contains residues characterized by constant velocity ( as in the a=120160 group ) .",
    "it is rather remarkable that residues with less than half the mass of the projectile nucleus are observed in this reaction .",
    "to gain insight into the underlying reaction mechanisms , we have performed simulations using an appropriate phenomenological model .",

    "we observe that the latter calculation with the acceptance cut does a fair job in describing the z@xmath50 values of the a=160190 residues , but predicts more n - rich fragments , consistent with fission , in the region a@xmath58160 .",
    "thus , the heavy residue group a=120160 seen in the data is not predicted by the calculation , due to the prevalence of fission as a deexcitation channel in the gemini calculation .",

    "1c ) indicate that these fragments ( a=120160 ) are not the result of symmetric fission .",
    "what have we learned from this high resolution experimental study of the residues produced in the reaction 20 mev / nucleon @xmath0au + @xmath1zr ?",
    "two findings seem of particular importance .",
    "they are : ( a ) the observation of surviving residues ( a=120160 ) which appear to result from `` hard collisions '' .",
    "they are relatively neutron - deficient with broad charge distributions and velocity , on average , corresponding to a linear momentum transfer of @xmath4 15% .",
    "( b ) a semi - quantitative description of heavy residue formation in intermediate energy collisions between massive nuclei by the hybrid model of veselsky followed by the statistical deexcitation code gemini was found . however , the calculation was not able to describe the residue group with a=120160 , and gave primarily fission fragments in the whole mass range a@xmath58160 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the support of the a1200 group and operations staff of michigan state university during the measurements and the help of l. hart in the analysis of the data .",
    "one of us ( g.a.s ) is also thankful to m. veselsky for his help in the course of calculations and stimulating discussions . financial support for this work",
