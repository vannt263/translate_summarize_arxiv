    "m = 0 , \\ldots , n-1)\\ ] ]    _ proof : _ the proof is evident from the use of the results obtained in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "the condition 41 imposes a rather weak restriction for the choice of the sampling instants .",
    "in fact , intervals can be specified @xcite , @xcite so that complete reachability ( observability ) is preserved .",
    "we can also remark that , for this kind of system , the _ n_-reachability and _ n_-observability are inseparable concepts .",
    "these systems are either _ n_-reachable and _ n_-observable or , if not , they are neither _",
    "n_-reachable nor _ n_-observable .",
    "it must be noticed that the condition 41 depends exclusively on the characteristic modes and the sampling sequence .",
    "thus , the _ n_-reachability ( _ n_-observability ) for these systems is independent of the chosen realisation .    if the system does not verify the condition _",
    "( b ) _ , then the results obtained will still be valid for the subsystem controllable and observable .    note how reachability involves statements about inputs and states , while observability about outputs and states .",
    "nevertheless , both aspects are related to the same intrinsic system properties .",
    "consequently , the algebraic characterization for reachability and observability can be unified .",
    "in stability theory , it is not enough to know whether a system is stable or unstable but also the degree of stability . in a similar way , it is important to know the degree of observability ( controllability ) of the system ; in the sense that there are different levels of certitude in the process of resolution of the corresponding linear equations .    from a heuristic viewpoint ,",
    "the degree of observability ( controllability ) depends on the spatial relationship among the column vectors of the observability ( controllability ) matrix .",
    "in particular , maximum observability ( controllability ) is obtained when these vectors are mutually orthogonal @xcite .",
    "different geometric structures , which show the evolution in time of the above mentioned vectors , can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , the question is to choose conveniently the sampling instants to obtain maximum orthogonality .",
    "we start from an arbitrary minimal realisation @xmath22 of the given system eqn .",
    "3 . the controllability matrix    @xmath84\\ ] ]    can be easily reduced to the matrix @xmath85\\ ] ]    @xmath86    ( @xmath87 defined as before ) more convenient for the geometric interpretation ; as the factor @xmath88 in eqn .",
    "15 affects only the module of the column vectors but not their spatial position .",
    "analogous results can be obtained making use of the transpose observability matrix .",
    "note that matrix 43 depends exclusively on the system characteristic modes and the sampling sequence ; thus the degree of observability and controllability is independent of the chosen realisation .",
    "now the problem is reduced to a right choice of the sampling instants , in such a way that the vectors @xmath89 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "some qualitative examples are presented :    _ example 1 : _ we are going to consider a 2nd - order model with a pair of complex eigenvalues @xmath90 then @xmath91 = [ exp ( j\\alpha_0)y_0 , exp ( j\\alpha_1)y_0]\\ ] ]    @xmath92 \\qquad ( b > 0)\\ ] ]    @xmath93 defined as before .",
    "as we are in @xmath94 , the geometric interpretation is very simple .",
    "the generic operator @xmath95 applied to the vector @xmath45 can be viewed as follows .",
    "it is a counterclockwise rotation through @xmath96 radians , followed by a stretching ( or shrinking ) of the length of @xmath45 by a factor @xmath97 @xcite .    from this interpretation ,",
    "it is easy to see ( fig .",
    "1 ) that the vectors @xmath98 , will be mutually orthogonal if , and only if ,    @xmath99    in this case , maximum observability ( controllability ) is achieved . in this situation ,",
    "expression 48 coincides with the results obtained by troch @xcite for the same model , when the problem of a minimum transmission of the measuring errors is discussed .    _ example 2 : _ let us now study a 3-order model with a real pole and a complex pair : @xmath100    therefore",

    "the vectors @xmath106 have their origin at the point ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and their end at the points @xmath107 of the parametric curve ( fig .",
    "heuristically we can imagine the same vectors as before ( 2-dimensional example ) pointing upwards from the _ xy_-plane as they have a third component on the _ z_-axis .",
    "given @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the question is now to choose the sampling instant such that the vector @xmath110 obeys its motion law and , simultaneously , is the most orthogonal vector to the other two .",
    "in fact , let @xmath111 be the projection on the _ xy_-plane of the vectors @xmath112 , respectively :    @xmath113    @xmath114    @xmath115    with    @xmath116    the sampling sequence must be selected such that @xmath117    then @xmath118    this number can be understood as the angle of a counterclockwise rotation . to obtain the more adequate value for @xmath119 , we analyse the geometry of this situation .",
    "let @xmath120 be a vector orthogonal to @xmath108 and @xmath121 with its end on the revolution surface .",

    "53 ; then the best value of @xmath119 will be the integer for which the expression    @xmath124    is minimum .",
