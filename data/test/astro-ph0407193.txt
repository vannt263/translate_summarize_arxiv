    "for more than 50 years @xcite , a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaching the main sequence ( ms ) has been the most direct tool for measuring the star formation history in a stellar population .",
    "much of that work focused on the ages of simple stellar populations , such as star clusters , within our own galaxy . by the late 1980s , the leap in sensitivity and photometric precision offered by the widespread use of ccds , coupled with advances in stellar evolution models , allowed accurate estimates for the ages of galactic globular clusters @xcite . in the 1990s , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the subsequent installation of the wide field planetary camera 2 enabled the measurement of star formation histories in more complicated populations throughout the local group . beyond the closest satellites of the milky way , these studies focused on the brighter and younger populations in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "in 2001 , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was installed on hst , and its dramatic improvements in sensitivity , field of view , and sampling enabled dating of the oldest populations out to the edge of the local group .",
    "extremely deep acs imaging of andromeda ( m31 ) showed that its halo is surprisingly younger than our own @xcite , with over half of the halo younger than 11  gyr , and with 30% of the population at intermediate ages of 68  gyr ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the data from such long exposures are also useful for studying transient phenomena ( e.g. , microlensing , supernovae ) and variable stars @xcite . soon",
    "two more deep fields will be obtained in m31 s outer disk and giant tidal stream . because the acs field is extremely small compared to the size of local group galaxies ( e.g. ,",
    "the m31 halo is several degrees across ) , hst can only produce pencil - beam samples in each major component of a nearby galaxy .",
    "m31 s complex substructure , seen in maps of its bright giant stars @xcite , can not be sampled at this depth within the remaining hst lifetime .",
    "there are two near - term avenues for major advances in the study of star formation histories utilizing upcoming optical space missions ( figure 2 ) : the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) .",
    "the james webb space telescope will also make progress , but its infrared bands do not provide as good a temperature lever for ms stars .    as an optical telescope with the sensitivity and sampling of hst , but with a much larger field of view , snap could map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large galaxies like m31 and m33 .",
    "the observing program might consist of two stages : an exploratory stage , where shallow tiles across the galaxy provide secondary age diagnostics on the red giant branch and horizontal branch , and a deep followup stage , providing direct age diagnostics via ms photometry , sampling at a @xmath020% fill factor .",
    "current plans envision 0.1@xmath1 pixels ; 0.05@xmath1 is better suited to surveys of the m31 outer disk , while larger pixels would be restrict this work to the halo outskirts .",
    "its focal plane design ( with many fixed filters ) does not provide an efficient way to obtain two - band photometry over large fields , but the additional bands would provide tighter population constraints .    the optical coronograph version of the tpf , with its @xmath2 meter aperture , will provide high - contrast , high - resolution imaging over tiny fields of view as its prime mission . however , a secondary instrument with a wide field of view could obtain ms photometry in galaxies nearly 4 mpc away .",
    "currently , we are limited to the study of the two giant galaxies in the local group ( our own and andromeda ) plus a handful of smaller galaxies , but the volume of space that could be surveyed with tpf would include the cen - a group and the m81-m82 group ( figure 2 ) , greatly expanding the sample of galaxies .",

    "<S> deep color magnitude diagrams extending to the main sequence provide the most direct measure of the detailed star formation history in a stellar population . with large investments of observing time , hst can obtain such data for populations out to 1 mpc , but its field of view is extremely small in comparison to the size of local group galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation severely constrains our understanding of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the largest galaxy in the local group , andromeda , offers an ideal laboratory for studying the formation of large spiral galaxies , but the galaxy shows substructure on a variety of scales , presumably due to its violent merger history . within its remaining lifetime , hst can only sample a few sight - lines through this complex galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a wide field imager could provide a map of andromeda s halo , outer disk , and tidal streams , revealing the spatially - dependent star formation history in each structure . the same data would enable many secondary studies , such as the age variation in andromeda s globular cluster system , gigantic samples of variable stars , and microlensing tracers of the galaxy s dark matter distribution . </S>"
