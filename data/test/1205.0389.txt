    "four - dimensional conformal field theories have attracted much attention in the last decade , mainly because of their relevance in the context of the ads / cft correspondence and its developments as well as its applications in completely different fields of which condensed matter is an example .",

    "the symmetry is enough to solve the theory @xcite . in four and higher dimensions ,",
    "this is in general not true @xcite , since examples are known of theories with scale but not conformal symmetry @xcite , but meaningful statements can be made as well ( e.g. @xcite for the four - dimensional case ) .",
    "moreover , in the presence of supersymmetry , superconformal invariance puts restrictions on the operator scaling dimensions , independently of the space - time dimensionality @xcite .    for these theories ,",
    "a great deal of information can be obtained from the conformal group , that in four dimensions is @xmath3 and that acts non - linearly on the coordinates , due to the presence of operations such as the inversion and the special conformal transformations .",
    "however , it has been long known that it is possible to formulate the theory in such a way that the conformal group will act linearly on the coordinates , in the same fashion as the angular momentum does .",

    "this approach goes back to @xcite and had applications to m / string theory branes @xcite as well as to more complicated conformal field theories in @xcite ( in particular @xcite generalizes the construction from scalars to more generic tensor fields ) .",
