    "tracing the star formation history ( sfh ) in galactic disks is a crucial aspect of understanding their evolution .",
    "determination of a detailed sfh is practically only possible in the disk of the milky way , and various methods have been developed to do so .",
    "the most common method , introduced by @xcite , is to model the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "model cmds are computed by adopting an initial mass function , a metallicity - age relation , sets of isochrones and iterating the sfh until computed cmds match observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the chromospheric emission intensity in the ca h and k absorption lines in the spectra of f and g stars .",
    "however , due to stellar activity cycles , metallicity effects and other complications , chromospheric emission dating can become very uncertain ( see @xcite for a full discussion ) .",
    "a third method , described by @xcite , is based on the luminosity function of white dwarfs , which preserves details of the sfh . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that a very considerable fraction of the field star population in the milky way disk might have been formed in open clusters .",
    "these dissolve on fairly short timescales due to dynamical effects @xcite so that , even though only a small percentage of the stellar population is actually found in open clusters , the sfh of open clusters might be indicative for the overall sfh of the galaxy . however , since open clusters are typically young , this method can be used to study the sfh only over the last gyr of the evolution of the galactic disk . despite differences in the details ,",
    "the broad result of these studies is that the star formation rate ( sfr ) has been declining slowly for the last 5 gyr , prior to which it was rising slowly , and has been punctuated by bursts of star formation from time to time .    in this study",
    "we analyze a sample of m dwarfs , whose spectra show h@xmath0 emission ( dme ) , which we have drawn from the fourth edition of the catalogue of nearby stars ( cns4 , @xcite ) . like chromospheric",
    "ca h and k emission , h@xmath0 emission is related to magnetic activity in the stars which is in turn regulated by their internal constitution , and in particular by the depth of their convection zones @xcite .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated , using m dwarfs in nearby open clusters , that the period in which the stars show h@xmath0 emission is ( among other stellar properties ) closely correlated with their absolute magnitudes , and ranges from about 10@xmath3 yrs at absolute @xmath4-band magnitude m@xmath5 = 6 to some 10@xmath6 yrs at an absolute magnitude of m@xmath5 = 13 .",
    "after these timescales , the h@xmath0 emission essentially switches off .",
    "we have utilised this effect to reconstruct the sfh of the galactic disk in a new , independent manner .    in galaxy evolution studies ,",
    "the sfr is commonly expressed as a `` schmidt - kennicutt '' power law function of the surface density of the interstellar gas , even though the physical processes leading to this relation are not yet fully understood ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the various concepts ) .",
    "a relation between the sfr and the density of interstellar gas raised to some power was first suggested by @xcite in order to explain that the vertical scale height of young stellar populations in the galactic disk is smaller compared to that of the interstellar gas .",
    "this relation was later modified by @xcite who correlated the sfr observed in other spiral galaxies with the surface densities of their interstellar gas either in concentric rings around the centers of the galaxies or averaged over their entire optical disks .",
    "the sfrs and gas surface densities of the galaxies studied by @xcite are based on present day states of the disks .",
    "similarly @xcite have derived a schmidt - kennicutt relation for the disk of the milky way based on its present day gas content .",
    "they correlated the radial density distribution of the interstellar gas in the galactic disk with the radial variation of the disk s present day sfr , finding a relation which is steeper than the original schmidt - kennicutt relation for other galaxies .",
    "what we address here is whether the schmidt - kennicutt law also holds true in the disk s evolution in the past , particularly over the last 5 gyrs or so .",
    "the m dwarfs permit us to track the sfh , and we use the chemical enrichment history of the galactic disk to reconstruct its gas surface density over time .",
    "our paper is organized as follows :",
    "in the next section we describe our data . in section 3",
    "we derive the sfh and in section 4 we try to establish a schmidt - kennicutt law for earlier epochs of galactic evolution .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "our basic sample consists of 1453 m dwarfs extracted from the cns4 ( 4th catalog of nearby stars ) which are within 25 pc from the sun",
    ". 210 of them are classified as dme .",
    "the emission strength data come from the palomar / msu nearby - star spectroscopic survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this survey was based on an earlier version of the catalogue of nearby stars @xcite .",
    "the dme are binned into half - magnitude intervals of absolute magnitudes from m@xmath5 = 8.75 to m@xmath5 = 12.75 mag and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with star counts in the cns4 of all m dwarfs of the same absolute magnitudes .",
    "the latter were restricted to that sample on which the palomar / msu nearby - star spectroscopic survey is based .",
    "since we want to concentrate here on the thin disk of the milky way , we only use stars with vertical @xmath7 velocities with @xmath8 50 km / s @xcite .    to assess the completeness of our sample",
    ", we have determined the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance from the sun .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] on double logarithmic scales . in a spatially homogeneous sample",
    "the cumulative number of stars grows in proportion to @xmath9 .",
    "this is indicated as solid lines with a slope of 3 in the logarithmic diagram . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] our samples become seriously incomplete beyond 15 pc of the sun ( this was demonstrated already by @xcite with a preliminary version of the cns4 ) , but this incompleteness has only a small effect on the method we use , which depends on the relative numbers of stars with and without h@xmath0 emission , and furthermore such stars have almost the same likelihood of being in the source catalogue .",
    "this can be quantified as follows .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates that the dme are undersampled compared to the entire sample of m dwarfs .",
    "for example , within a radius of 25 pc from the sun 53 percent of nearby m dwarfs in the magnitude range , which we consider here , are catalogued in the cns4 , and 44 percent of the dme in this range are so catalogued . to reach a completeness level",
    "the same as in the complete sample at this distance ( 25 pc ) implies that some 43 dme are missing from the cns4 .",
    "the different sampling rates are almost certainly due to the fact that the m dwarf sample in the cns4 is biased towards high proper motion stars .",
    "dme at the bright end of the luminosity function are very young and have low space velocities .",
    "thus it is very plausible that they are undersampled compared to the entire m dwarf sample .",
    "indeed @xcite have shown that the velocity dispersions of the dme are significantly smaller than the mean velocity dispersions of m dwarfs in the cns4 .",
    "we discuss possible consequences of the effect for our results below .",
    "we note that dme seem frequently to be members of binary or multiple systems .",
    "63% of the dme of our sample are flagged as binaries in the cns4 , whereas only 28% of the m dwarfs without h@xmath0 emission are so flagged .",
    "however we do not attribute any significance to these numbers , because the degree of completeness of the identification of binaries in the cns4 is not known . in a systematic study",
    ", @xcite found that 42%@xmath109% of m dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood are binaries .",
    "unresolved binarity might occasionally shift a star in our sample from one half - magnitude bin into a neighbouring bin , but we expect no systematic effects as a consequence .",
    "next we calculate the _ limiting age _ @xmath11 of the stars in each magnitude bin , using the calibration of @xcite    @xmath12    star formation rates are usually reckoned in terms of surface density per time interval , whereas our sample is confined to within 25 pc of the sun , and samples volume density . to correct our sample from volume to surface density , we note that in the disk s vertical gravitational potential the vertical scale height of stars is known to depend linearly on their vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "we have multiplied the numbers of m dwarfs in each magnitude bin by the @xmath7 velocity dispersion of stars with the same typical ages to obtain the surface density of stars of that age , @xmath13 . for the latter we have adopted the values given for groups 6d , 6c , 6b , 6a , and groups 5 - 2 in table 4 of @xcite .",
    "our derivation of the sfh relies thus on the frequency of m dwarfs observed in the solar neighbourhood and corrected to be representative for a cylinder at the position of the sun and perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "however , the local volume actually samples stars from much more distant parts of the milky way . at the solar annulus , the orbital period around the galactic center , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the angular velocity of the local standard of rest , is @xmath16 220 km / s / 8 kpc = 2.3@xmath1710@xmath18 yrs .",
    "this means that stars with ages of order 10@xmath18 yrs can reach the solar neighbourhood from the other side of the galaxy .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the epicyclic motions of the stars .",
    "the typical sizes of the epicycles can be estimated from the velocity dispersions of the stars @xmath19 in the radial and @xmath20 in the azimuthal directions , respectively , with the relations @xcite",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22 denotes the second oort constant .",
    "if we assume a flat galactic rotation curve , @xmath23 , and use again the velocity dispersions given in table 4 of @xcite , we find for stars with ages @xmath24 = 0.2 gyrs @xmath25 = 240 pc and @xmath26 = 340 pc , rising to @xmath25 = 1.1 kpc and @xmath26 = 1.6 kpc for stars with a mean age of @xmath24 = 2.3 gyrs , which correspond to our oldest age bin .",
    "thus we sample dme in a ring around the galactic center with a width of about one to two kpc , which we term `` the solar circle '' .",
    "the surface densities determined in the previous section depend on how far back the past sfh has been sampled , but are also weighted by the main sequence luminosity function @xmath27 , i.e.  the relative frequency distribution of stars as a function of absolute magnitude . since m dwarfs are so long - lived , their luminosity function can be safely assumed to be unchanging with time . as is customary practice in studies of the sfh",
    "we assume that the sfh has been the same for all m dwarfs in our sample irrespective of mass ( they have masses in the range 0.7 to 0.2 @xmath28 , @xcite ) .",
    "below we compare our results with sfhs determined with other stellar types .",
    "the numbers @xmath29 determined above can be then interpreted as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the present age of the galactic disk , for which we adopt a value of 10@xmath32 yrs , and where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the surface density of the stellar disk and the sfr at the epoch @xmath35 , respectively . in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] we have assumed that the surface density of stellar disk was initially @xmath36 . thus the ratio @xmath37 allows us to determine @xmath38 , which represents the sfh of the disk as a function of time @xmath39 relative to the stellar surface density now ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is shown on logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "the vertical error bars reflect only poisson errors .",
    "the horizontal error bars have been estimated by the scatter of the calibration data points around the linear @xmath41  log(age ) regression line of @xcite .",
    "the calibration is based on 5 open clusters in which the authors have determined the limiting @xmath41 of the dmes .",
    "the ages of the clusters are somewhat uncertain . to their oldest cluster , m67 , @xcite",
    "assign an age of 5.4 gyrs , whereas other determinations find 4 @xmath10 0.5 gyrs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the ages of the younger clusters used by @xcite like the hyades or the pleiadesof with ages of 625 and 130 myrs , respectively , are uncertain on the order of 10 myrs @xcite .",
    "we have fitted to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] in the range of disk age @xmath39 = 5 to 10 gyrs a relation of the form    @xmath42    and find an index of @xmath43 = 2.2@xmath44 .",
    "the star formation rate is then given by    @xmath45    a relation which declines with time .",
    "as can be seen from fig .  3 a constant star formation rate does not fit the data .",
    "as described above , the ratios @xmath46 have to be corrected upwards due to the relative undersampling of the dme .",
    "this affects mainly the younger , bright dme as they have low space velocities . in our view",
    "this explains the irregular pattern of @xmath46 ratios at @xmath39 = 9 and 9.3 gyrs . shifting the latter up to the fitting curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] would require some 39 additional stars .",
    "this is almost precisely the number of stars we have estimated above needed to be added to the dme sample so that it reaches the same level of relative completeness as the entire m dwarf sample . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] such a correction leads to an even better fit of eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] to the @xmath46 data .",
    "the sun and the stars in its vicinity are at present embedded in the `` local bubble '' of the interstellar medium , a cavity with a diameter of about 200 pc filled with hot diluted gas .",
    "the physical conditions of this gas are such that one does not expect any stars to be presently forming within it . however , the local bubble is quite young . @xcite",
    "have recently redetermined its age and found that it was formed about 15 myrs or less ago .",
    "the ages of the dme in our youngest age bin are of the order of 100 myrs so that most of them were born before the local bubble was formed .",
    "our results on the sfh are therefore not affected by the presence of the local bubble today .",
    "unfortunately we can not derive absolute rates for the sfh using our method .",
    "however we can estimate its magnitude roughly by observing that , according to our determination , the surface density of the stellar component of the galactic disk s mass grew by 20 percent of today s surface density over the last 3 gyrs .",
    "@xcite find a local surface density of the stellar galactic disk of 35.5 @xmath28 pc@xmath47 which corresponds to a sfr of 2.4 @xmath28 pc@xmath47 gyr@xmath48 .",
    "the local surface density of interstellar atomic and molecular hydrogen is 6.5 @xmath28 pc@xmath47 @xcite . very interestingly , this combination of parameters places the milky way right on the @xcite relation , even though we use local disk star data , whereas kennicutt s data are radially averaged over the whole disk . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have reproduced the data of @xcite and indicated the location of the milky way in the diagram . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the milky way falls precisely in the region populated by similar galaxy types to it , i.e. sb - sbc .",
    "our determination of the shape of the sfh is consistent with other determinations of the sfh of the milky way disk .",
    "we compare our results in particular with the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite , who modelled the cmd of stars younger than 3 gyrs , and @xcite , who modelled the cmd of nearby stars observed with hipparcos , can be directly compared with our results , because they refer to column densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show on a logarithmic scale @xmath38 as obtained in this work versus @xmath38 , which we have constructed by integrating the sfrs determined by @xcite and @xcite . short duration star bursts in the sfr are effectively smoothed away by the integration procedure .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 also a sfh determined by integrating the sfr derived by @xcite from the age distribution of nearby open clusters .",
    "their local number densities have been corrected to be representative for column densities by multiplying them by the vertical velocity dispersions @xmath49 typical for stars of the same age @xcite .",
    "similarly we have integrated and converted the sfr found by @xcite modelling the cmd of hipparcos stars ( using the data which have been clipped in velocity space ) . over the last 3 gyrs",
    "all sfhs fit excellently together . given the totally different approaches in deriving the sfh",
    "the good agreement is , in our view , quite remarkable . as explained above , the deviation of our data 0.7 and 1 gyr ago from the other sfhs and the fitting formula [ eq3 ] is in our interpretation due to the proper motion bias in the cns4 .",
    "this affects mainly the bright dmes with short limiting h@xmath0 emission ages .",
    "the velocity dispersion of young stars increases with age by factor of 3 @xcite .",
    "thus our older age bins are expected to be more complete as they indeed seem to be . beyond ages of 3 gyrs",
    "the sfh determined by @xcite is consistent with the sfh derived in this work , whereas the sfh by @xcite falls in that age range for unknown reasons systematically below the two other determinations .",
    "finally we show in fig .  5 also a sfh obtained by integrating the sfr of @xcite which is based on nearby f and g stars dated with chromospheric emission ages .",
    "this sfh differs significantly from the other sfhs shown there and is consistent with a constant sfr ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . with the exception of the results by @xcite , the consistent picture of the disk s sfr",
    "is that @xmath38 rises steeply as a function of look - back time @xmath50 until about 5 gyr .",
    "we can not resolve with our data the sfh at earlier epochs of galactic evolution .",
    "however , the other determinations of the sfh summarized in @xcite indicate a turn over of the sfr to an apparently much reduced rate at early epochs .",
    "as @xcite has pointed out , the data ( which we have reproduced in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) suggest a relation between the sfr and the surface density of the interstellar gas @xmath51 of the form    @xmath52    with an index @xmath1 = 1.4 @xmath10 0.15 and a coefficient @xmath53 = ( 2.5@xmath100.7)@xmath1710@xmath54 @xmath55/yr / kpc@xmath56 .",
    "let us consider the gas content of the galactic disk as being regulated by two processes  on one hand interstellar gas is converted into stars , but on the other hand the disk accrets primordial gas ,    @xmath57    the present accretion rate of gas , as inferred from infalling high velocity hi clouds is about 1 @xmath28 pc@xmath47 gyr@xmath48 @xcite , but the rate is unknown for earlier epochs of galactic evolution . in order to constrain the amount of accreted gas we invoke constraints provided by the chemical enrichment history of the galactic disk . in a one - zone model the enrichment or depletion of heavy elements",
    "is described by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 denotes the mass fraction of heavy elements . in eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] , we employed the instantaneous recycling approximation characterized by the yield @xmath60 .",
    "the geneva - copenhagen survey of nearby f and g stars @xcite has shown that the metallicity of the galactic disk has been , within statistical uncertainties , constant over most of its evolution ( `` flat '' ) . in view of contradictory claims by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "@xcite have thoroughly reanalyzed the geneva - copenhagen survey and discussed meticulously all selection effects .",
    "they confirm their earlier conclusion that the age - metallicity relation is indeed flat . assuming this to be the case , equations [ eq2 ] and [ eq7 ] imply then @xmath61 or    @xmath62    the ratio @xmath63 has a value of about @xmath63 = 0.7 @xcite , which is another way of stating that accretion of gas is important for the evolution of the galactic disk .    taking the derivative of eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] we find    @xmath64    if we insert the parameterization of @xmath65 introduced in eq .  [ eq3 ] , eqs .  [ eq4 ] , [ eq8 ] , and [ eq9 ] lead to    @xmath66    with    @xmath67    a comparison of the coefficients shows then that the indices are related by    @xmath68    in the previous section we determined a value of @xmath43 = 2.2@xmath44 , which implies an index of the schmidt - kennicutt law of @xmath1 = 1.45@xmath2 .",
    "this fits , within statistical uncertainties , very well to the index observed by @xcite for the present day sfr in other galaxies .",
    "apparently the sfh of the milky way disk was regulated by the same schmidt - kennicutt law over the last 5 gyrs . at earlier epochs",
    "the slope @xmath43 was probably shallower , which would imply a larger index @xmath1 for the schmidt - kennicutt law .    in deriving eq .",
    "[ eq10 ] we have assumed an accretion rate of primordial gas that compensated exactly the metal enrichment due to star formation so that the metallicity stayed constant during the evolution of the galactic disk , in line with the observations by @xcite .",
    "but many models of the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy predict a mild chemical enrichment of the galactic disk over the last 5 gyrs ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "this is due to less accretion than we assumed .",
    "however , our principal result on the slope of the schmidt - kennicutt law does not depend on the absolute amount of accreted gas .",
    "we note that a ` closed - box ' model with @xmath69 , which is known to lead to a relative distribution of metallicities in the milky way disk quite inconsistent with observations @xcite , implies the same relation as we found in eq .",
    "cosmological models of gas accretion onto galaxies and of the ensuing chemical enrichment history predict accretion rates which decline with time @xcite , similar to the sfr which we found for the last 5 gyrs . thus",
    "a relation of the kind @xmath70 will approximately hold and we argue that our result on the slope of the schmidt - kennicutt relation should be rather robust .",
    "we have used a new method on a sample of m dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood showing h@xmath71 emission in their spectra , to trace backwards the star formation history ( sfh ) of the milky way disk .",
    "the m stars show h@xmath0 emission up until a certain age ( which is a well calibrated function of their absolute magnitudes ) allowing us to reconstruct the rate at which stars have been born in the disk at the solar circle over about half its lifetime .",
    "the star formation history of the galaxy seems to be well resolved over the last 5 gyrs using our m dwarf sample .",
    "we find that the star formation rate ( sfr ) rises continuously when looking backwards to 5 gyr .",
    "this is in very good agreement with other determinations of the star formation history of the galactic disk by different methods .    in order to derive a schmidt - kennicutt law for the local disk",
    ", we have determined the variation of the surface density of the interstellar gas in the galactic disk during the formation and evolution of the disk .",
    "the gas content of the disk is controlled by the competition between the star formation process , on one hand , and accretion of gas from outside the galaxy , on the other hand . since the latter can not be observed directly , we had to infer the amount of accreted gas indirectly . for this purpose",
    "we have invoked the chemical enrichment history of the galactic disk . based on the observation that the metallicity of the galactic disk has remained rather constant during its evolution ( in particular over the last 5 gyr )",
    "we show that the gas infall rate is proportional to the sfr .",
    "we have then correlated the sfr with the surface density of the interstellar gas and found that the correlation followed over the last 5 gyrs a schmidt - kennicutt law with an index of @xmath1 = 1.45@xmath2 .",
    "this agrees , within statistical uncertainties , with the value of @xmath1 = 1.4 found by @xcite for the present day sfr in other galaxies .",
    "it seems that at epochs of galactic evolution earlier than that stars formed at a much reduced star formation rate , which does not follow the schmidt - kennicutt law .",
    "the investigation of the reason for this change of the mode of star formation is beyond the scope of this paper , but we hope to address this question in the future .",

    "<S> we use a new method to trace backwards the star formation history of the milky way disk , using a sample of m dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood which is representative for the entire solar circle . </S>",
    "<S> m stars are used because they show h@xmath0 emission until a particular age which is a well calibrated function of their absolute magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to reconstruct the rate at which disk stars have been born over about half the disk s lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> our star formation rate agrees well with those obtained by using other , independent , methods and seems to rule out a constant star formation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the principal result of this study is to show that a relation of the schmidt - kennicut type ( which relates the star formation rate to the interstellar gas content of galaxy disks ) has pertained in the milky way disk during the last 5 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rate we derive from the m dwarfs and the interstellar gas content of the disk can be inferred as a function of time from a model of the chemical enrichment of the disk , which is well constrained by the observations indicating that the metallicity of the galactic disk has remained nearly constant over the timescales involved . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the star formation rate and gas surface densities over the last 5 gyrs can be accurately described by a schmidt - kennicutt law with an index of @xmath1 = 1.45@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is , within statistical uncertainties , the same value found for other galaxies . </S>"
