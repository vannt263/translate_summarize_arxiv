    "one of the challenges facing the next - generation wireless networks is to cope with the expected demand for data . not only to support high quality of service ( qos ) but also to improve spectral efficiency ,",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm)-based cellular systems have been widely deployed .",
    "an essential requirement for ofdm - based cellular systems , however , is to specify and to enhance the performance of cell - edge mobile users ( mus ) or worst - case mus @xcite . unlike the code division multiple access ( cdma ) cellular system that is robust against interference",
    ", the ofdm - based cellular network suffers from high inter - cell interference ( ici ) at the cell boundary , especially due to the smaller cell size and denser reuse of spectrum in future mobile communications .",
    "there has been a substantial amount of work on evaluating the performance of cell - edge mus or worst - case mus on a regular hexagonal model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , this model is highly idealized and less accurate as the base station ( bs ) can be randomly located to support a large number of mus . to reflect the actual bs deployment , cellular networks",

    "the main purpose of this letter is to serve as a baseline for future research on the performance of the worst - case mu .",
    "modeling the location of the bss by a poisson point process ( ppp ) , we address the performance of the worst - case mu analytically . under i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading on all links , we derive the coverage probability and the spectral efficiency .    to get insights on the performance of the worst - case mu",
    ", we compare our analytical results with those for the typical mu derived by andrews _",

    "our conclusion is that the coverage probability of the worst - case mu decreases down to 23% of that of the typical mu at the target signal - to - interference - ratio ( sir ) @xmath0 db .",
    "the spectral efficiency of the worst - case mu becomes 19% of that of the typical mu .",
    "additionally , we investigate how much the performance of the worst - case mu is improved by applying a coordinated scheduling ( cs ) scheme @xcite .",
    "consider the downlink cellular network consisting of bss and mus .",
    "we assume the locations of the bss by points of a homogeneous ppp @xmath1 on the plane with intensity @xmath2 .",
    "if an mu is associated with the nearest bs , then the resulting coverage areas are divided into voronoi cells and such a partition is called a _",

    "depending on how many nearest bss to a given mu , we can define three types of the mus in the network : an _ inner - cell _ mu is in the voronoi cell with exactly one closest bs .",
    "an _ edge - cell _ mu with two closest bss is on the boundary between two voronoi cells , and a _ worst - case _ mu with three closest bss is in a vertex , where three voronoi cells meet , as shown in fig .",
    "there are no mus with four or more closest bss with respect to a homogeneous ppp @xcite .      for the sake of simplicity and tractability",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the following assumptions :    * each bs transmits a constant power of @xmath3 . *",
    "the fading on all links is i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh distributed with mean @xmath4 . *",
    "an mu can be served by at most one bs . *",
    "no intra - cell interference is present due to orthgonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) .",
    "* the noise power at any mu receiver is @xmath5 .    to investigate the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) for a worst - case mu",
    ", we assume that it is served by one of the nearest bss .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that the worst - case mus still follow a homogeneous poisson point process with intensity @xmath6 .    without loss of generality , we denote the serving bs for the worst - case mu by @xmath7 ( i.e. , the other two bss having the same distance from the worst - case mu are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) . assuming that the worst - case mu is located at the origin , the resulting sinr at its associated bs at a random distance @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the total received interference at the location of the worst - case mu from all bss other than its associated bs .",
    "note that there are two nearest interfering bss located at a distance @xmath10 and the other interfering bss from the distance @xmath14 to the worst - case mu .",
    "the value @xmath15 follows an exponential distribution .",
    "let us derive the _ coverage _ probability of a worst - case mu in the downlink cellular network .",

    "we now explain our main result for the coverage probability of the worst - case mu under i.i.d .",

    "appendix a. @xmath23 in the _ interference - limited _ system , i.e. , the noise power @xmath5 is negligible compared to the total received interference , the probability ( 4 ) can be simplified to @xmath24 if the path loss exponent @xmath25 , the probability ( 5 ) can be further reduced to the following simple - closed form @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "an interesting observation is that the coverage probability of the worst - case mu is independent of the bs density @xmath2 .",
    "even if more bss are deployed , this does not affect the coverage probability of the worst - case mu since the received and interference powers cancel each other out @xcite .",
    "thus , some advanced techniques are needed to increase it .",
    "it is noticeable that the coverage probability of the typical mu is @xmath28 @xcite , which is higher than ( 6 ) .      a coordinated scheduling ( cs ) scheme is considered as a promising technique to mitigate ici @xcite . since coordinated bss can share channel information from the mu , only one bs that has the best channel condition from the mu transmits to the mu to guarantee its performance in a given subframe .",
    "to see the impact of the cs scheme , we focus on the interference - limited system with @xmath25 .",

    "* _ the coverage probability of the worst - case mu in the downlink coordinated scheduling scheme is : @xmath29 _ * proof . *",
    "appendix b.@xmath23 comparing with ( 6 ) , we can see that the better coverage probability is achieved as shown in ig .",
    "a question is how much the probability is improved . in the next subsection ,",
    "we compare ( 7 ) with @xmath28 , that of the typical mu .      ig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the coverage probability versus the sir threshold @xmath30 under i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading on all links with @xmath25 . as noted ,",
    "the coverage probability of the worst - case mu is lower than that of the typical mu . since the received signal decays exponentially with the propagation distance , the worst - case mu experiences large path loss , which decreases the coverage probability of the worst - case mu down to 23% of that of the typical mu at @xmath0db .",
    "given that , by applying the cs scheme , the better coverage probability can be achieved . in terms of the coverage probability , there is a cross - over point between the worst - case mu with the cs scheme and the typical mu at @xmath31db .",
    "below the cross - over point , the enhanced signal quality completely pay off the large path loss , which leads to a better coverage probability compared with that of the typical mu . beyond the cross - over point",
    ", however , the large path loss prevails over the increased signal strength , which causes the coverage probability to decrease dramatically beyond the cross - over point .",
    "overall , the cs scheme improves the coverage probability of the worst - case mu , virtually shifting it to a typical mu .",
    "in this section , we derive the spectral efficiency of a worst - case mu and investigate how much it is improved by the cs scheme .",
    "* proposition 2 . * _ in the interference - limited system with @xmath25 , the spectral efficiency of a worst - case mu located a typical vertex is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 _ * proof . *",

    "significant performance gain can be achieved for the worst - case mu . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some performance degradations in practice due to the latency for coordination @xcite .",
    "also , the area spectral efficiency might be decreased by muting two dominant interferers .",

    "this is the first approach to analytically derive the performance of the worst - case mu , using the stochastic geometry . even if simplifying assumptions",
    "are made , we believe our analysis plays vital roles in analyzing randomly deployed bss and serving as a reference for future research on the performance of the worst - case mu .",
