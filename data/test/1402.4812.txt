    "the formation of black holes during a failed supernova ( sn ) has generally been assumed to lead to a black hole with the mass of the star at the time core collapse is initiated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that this was not true of red supergiants because the hydrogen envelope is so weakly bound that the drop in the gravitational potential created by neutrino losses is enough to unbind the envelope .",
    "radiation hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite confirmed this supposition .",
    "failed sne of red supergiants lead to the formation of black holes with ( roughly ) the mass of the helium core of the star at the time of collapse and not the total mass of the star .",
    "this new expectation is of particular interest because studies of sn progenitors appear to be finding too few massive progenitors ( @xcite ) particularly in the upper end of the red supergiant mass range ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that red supergiant progenitors were missing from @xmath3 to the upper mass limit for stars to explode as red supergiants and become type  iip sne ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) .",
    "this is an interesting mass range for failed sne because theoretical studies indicate that many stellar models in this mass range have density structures that make it more difficult to produce a successful explosion ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other options include changing stellar models so that stars in this mass range do not end their lives as red supergiants ( e.g. @xcite ) or using dusty winds to make them less observable ( e.g. @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "producing failed sne in this mass range also provides a natural explanation for the observed distribution of remnant masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remnant mass function is bimodal between neutron stars with masses near @xmath6 and black holes with masses of @xmath7-@xmath8 , although it is uncertain if the gap in the mass function is truly empty or simply a deep minimum ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this gap is difficult to explain if black holes form by fall back of material in a successful explosion ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the gap is , however , a natural consequence of combining supernovae without fall back , which best explain the masses observed in neutron star binaries ( @xcite ) , with a population of @xmath9 failed supernovae where the typical black hole mass of @xmath10 is simply the typical helium core mass of the failed sne .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the ejection of the envelope would be associated with a relatively long lived ( @xmath11 year ) , modest luminosity ( @xmath12 ) transient largely powered by the recombination of the envelope .",
    "we have been carrying out a search for failed sne using the large binocular telescope following the ideas of @xcite , where we monitor nearby galaxies to see if any stars effectively vanish , potentially with some intervening transient phenomenon .",
    "this survey can easily identify the transients predicted by @xcite , although it is not well suited for identifying the shorter ( @xmath11  week ) shock break out peak associated with the event ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these more massive red supergiants tend to have winds that produce silicate dusts and other products of oxygen - rich chemistry ( see , e.g. , the review by @xcite ) , and , as mentioned earlier , @xcite even propose using this obscuration as a possible means of solving the red supergiant problem identified by @xcite . during the envelope ejection following a failed sne , this same material is going to be ejected _ en masse _ at much higher densities and only moderately higher velocities , so presumably it is also likely to form dust but in much greater quantities .",
    "this leads to the possibility that the optical properties of the transient are greatly modified from the dust free simulations carried out by @xcite .",
    "we already know of one class of transients that successfully cloaks themselves in dust following their peaks , the sn  2008s class of explosive transients from agb stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism here is very different , since the dust in the sn  2008s class is almost certainly dust re - forming in a pre - existing dense wind after being destroyed by the transient ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it does suggest an investigation of whether the visual transient predicted by @xcite will be substantially modified by dust formation and if the ejected dust has any consequences for our understanding of the interstellar medium . in ",
    "2 we model dust formation in these systems to find that the transients are not substantially modified even though they should be very efficient at forming significant masses of very large dust grains .",
    "we discuss the implications in  3 .",
    "a striking property of these transients is the ejection of the hydrogen envelope under conditions that seem remarkably conducive to the formation and growth of dust grains .",
    "the densities are very high compared to stellar winds that easily form dust and the transient luminosities and temperatures are relatively low . following our previous examination of dust formation in luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions ( @xcite ) , we adopt the physically reasonable view that particle nucleation simply occurs once conditions allow nucleation , and that we must then follow the collisional growth of the grains to estimate the resulting opacities and optical depths . from @xcite",
    "we have the transient temperature and luminosity , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the density and velocity profile at some late time @xmath15 for their @xmath16 models with ejecta kinetic energies of @xmath17 and @xmath18  ergs . at these late phases",
    ", we can view the ejecta as being in free expansion , so the velocity @xmath19 is now time independent .",
    "hence , the radius of the material at some other time @xmath20 is simply @xmath21 and at late times the density @xmath22 is related to the mass of the zone by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass in the zone and @xmath25 is the velocity difference across the zone edges .",
    "since the radiation from these transients is cold ( @xmath26-@xmath27  k , @xcite ) , there is no ultraviolet radiation that can stochastically heat dust grains as they try to form ( this is the mechanism that prevents dust formation around hot stars , see @xcite ) .",
    "we need only consider whether the equilibrium temperature of a small grain is lower than the temperature at which grains can form .",
    "this leads to the requirement that dust can only form once the ejecta is more distant than the time - dependent dust formation radius @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the planck mean absorption factor and @xmath30 to @xmath31  k is the dust formation temperature .",
    "we use the values for the smallest grain sizes ( @xmath32 m ) given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dform ] compares the evolution of @xmath33 to the photosphere defined by @xmath34 and to the radius of the outermost ejecta .",
    "we find that the ejecta are inside the @xmath33 until very late in the transient , so the first key result is that dust formation can only affect the late phases of the transient .",
    "note that if the gas is cooling adiabatically , the gas temperature is essentially guaranteed to be lower than the dust formation temperature at the time dust formation commences .",
    "we can normalize the gas temperature such that it has the photospheric temperature when it is at the photosphere , so @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "when the gas temperature reaches the formation temperature , @xmath37 , then the dust temperature ( ignoring planck factors ) due to the radiation field of @xmath38 will always exceed the dust formation temperature unless there is a precipitate drop in the luminosity .",
    "we explicitly checked this point as part of the calculation including the time variability of the luminosity and found that dust formation was always limited by radiative heating rather than adiabatic cooling .",
    "we simply assume that nucleation occurs , and then allow the dust to grow collisionally .",
    "the grain radius grows as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the typical collisional velocity , @xmath41 is the mass fraction of the species condensing onto the grains , @xmath42 is the gas density , and @xmath43 or @xmath17  g  @xmath44 is the bulk density of the graphitic or silicate grains ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if we normalize the density to the value at the formation radius @xmath45 and scale the collision velocities as @xmath46 , then we can integrate equation  [ eqn : rate ] to get the final size of the grains @xmath47 the size at any intermediate time is simply @xmath48\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the time the fluid element started to form dust . because growth is a collisional process",
    ", the rapidly dropping density means that most of the growth occurs between @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as a result ,",
    "the choice for the velocity scaling exponent @xmath53 is unimportant given the other uncertainties and we will simply use @xmath54 . here",
    "we have used a sticking probability of unity and ignored coagulation , where the former slows and the latter speeds growth .",
    "we will scale the amount of condensible material to @xmath55 , since silicate dust formation is more likely than carbonaceous dust given the properties of the winds of these stars . given the temperatures near the dust formation radius , we adopt @xmath56  km / s as a reasonable collision velocity . changing these values allows moderate changes in the grain sizes but leads to no qualitative changes .    as a check",
    ", we can apply this approach to a wind with mass loss rate @xmath57  year@xmath58 and velocity @xmath59  km / s around a star with luminosity @xmath60 .",
    "a silicate grain has an equilibrium temperature @xmath61  k at @xmath62  cm , implying a final grain size of @xmath63 for a constant velocity wind with @xmath64 .",
    "this is the correct order of magnitude for dust formation around an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star with these properties .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath65 m for @xmath66 , while our simple expression would give @xmath67 m .",
    "the estimate is low because the constant velocity assumption underestimates the time spent near @xmath51 as the formation of dust accelerates the flow . for dust formation in the ejecta of a transient ,",
    "this issue does not arise because the velocities are not controlled by the dust formation process .",
    "figure  [ fig : size ] shows the final grain sizes for silicate dust formed by failed sne assuming @xmath61  k. graphitic grains are larger roughly by the ratio of the bulk densities .",
    "the smaller scale structures in figure  [ fig : size ] are caused by fluctuations in the velocity divergence @xmath68 of the individual lagrangian zones in the velocity profile from @xcite that would average out over the expansion time but are present in an instantaneous snap shot of the ejecta .",
    "as expected , these transients offer excellent conditions for the growth of grains , with peak sizes for our nominal parameters on the scale of millimeters . with @xmath69 of ejecta ,",
    "the net dust production is @xmath70 of dust .",
    "there is some freedom to adjust the final sizes by changing the parameters ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 ) in equation  [ eqn : afinal ] , but not enough freedom to change the qualitative result that failed sne should produce a significant mass of very large dust grains .    at",
    "any given time , we can now determine which of the lagrangian zones from the @xcite simulations have passed their dust formation radius , and the size to which the grains have grown since that time .",
    "we then calculate the visual ( v - band ) opacities of these layers using the scaled cross sections @xmath73 .",
    "the optical depth is then @xmath74 where the integral extends from the dust formation radius @xmath33 from equation  [ eqn : rform ] to the outer edge of the star , and the density @xmath75 and grain size @xmath76 are functions of both radius and time .",
    "we separately calculate the absorption @xmath77 and scattering @xmath78 optical depths , again using @xcite and @xcite for the values of @xmath79 , and then use the approximation that the effective total absorption optical depth is @xmath80 .    in practice , as soon as dust formation is permitted , the transient is blacked out , as shown in figure  [ fig : tau ] . this is simply a consequence of the relatively small @xmath51 and the enormous amount of mass  in the first 10 days of this period , @xmath81 of material moves beyond the formation radius of order @xmath82  cm .",
    "this material will have an optical depth of @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the opacity .",
    "typical dusty materials have @xmath85 , which means that the optical depth will be large even if dust formation is very inefficient . as the source vanishes in the optical ,",
    "it would be replaced by a near / mid - ir source with an initial temperature near the dust formation temperature .",
    "it would rapidly become colder and fainter due to the combined effects of the collapsing luminosity and the increasing optical depth .",
    "this phase might be observable for a brief period ( weeks ) with jwst .",
    "despite having very favorable conditions for dust formation , the optical signature of a failed sne from a red supergiant will be little affected by dust formation .",
    "failed sne are , however , very efficient at producing dust compared to successful sne . keeping all else fixed",
    ", the final grain size in equation  [ eqn : afinal ] is @xmath86 because the growth rate at the dust formation radius scales as @xmath87 while the time scale over which the growth occurs is @xmath88 . since for a failed sne @xmath89  km / s and @xmath90 and",
    "for a successful sne @xmath91  km / s and @xmath92 , the nominal final size ratio of @xmath93 gives a sense of the difference .",
    "the hotter radiation temperature of successful sne further favors the failed sne .",
    "the one advantage for the successful sne is that the heavily metal enriched material outside the iron core is also ejected , so some fraction of the ejecta from a sne has a condensible fraction of @xmath94 instead of @xmath95 for the envelope of a red supergiant .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , even the very metal rich ejecta of real sne have slower dust growth rates than the envelope of a failed sn .",
    "the conditions are so favorable for dust formation that the grains formed in this scenario are enormous  up to @xmath96  mm in size .",
    "this is interesting because several recent experiments have found evidence for a significant population of very large extrasolar dust grains .",
    "impact detectors on the _ ulysses _ and _ galileo _ spacecraft ( @xcite , @xcite ) measured a significant flux of large grains entering the heliosphere up to their detection limit of @xmath97 m , and still larger 10 - 30@xmath98 m grains of apparently extrasolar origin have been found by ground - based radar studies of meteoroid re - entry trails ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting rates appear to be consistent with simply extending the roughly logarithmic distribution of grain masses , @xmath99 , ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) well beyond the standard truncation scale of the models for dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at @xmath100 m .",
    "there has been no natural source of these very large grains because even the most extreme stellar winds have natural size cutoffs of order @xmath101 m .",
    "there there are grains with agb star compositions as large as @xmath102 m found in meteorites , but they are rare ( @xcite ) . for still larger grains , ejection from proto - planetary disks may be possible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these failed sne would produce @xmath103 of all dust mass ( assuming sn and stars produce comparable amounts of dust ) with a mechanism that both naturally creates and ejects the grains into the interstellar medium ( ism ) at relatively low velocities so as to minimize sputtering .",
    "quantitatively , this would be too little mass to explain the solar system results . however , there is almost certainly a problem with the solar system abundance normalizations because simply extending the ism size distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) to larger sizes would lead to an abnormal average extinction curve ( @xmath104 ) and require a greater abundance of condensible species ( c , o , fe , etc . ) than is available ( @xcite ) .",
    "possible solutions include a local anomaly in the grain size distribution ( @xcite ) , propagation effects from the ism into the solar system ( @xcite ) or that the source of the grains is not actually extrasolar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the small dust mass fraction from failed sne would not create these problems . @xcite",
    "discuss a means of directly detecting large grains in the ism as a scattered light halo during optical transients . at present",
    ", however , it seems that interest in these large grains has waned  a relation to black hole formation , however bizarre , might provide a motivation to resolve these issues .",
    "i am grateful to e. lovegrove and s. woosley for sharing the results of their simulations so that these calculations could be performed , to n. murray for discussions of large dust grains , and to t.a .",
