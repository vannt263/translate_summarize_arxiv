    "gamma - ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe .",
    "( for reviews see piran 1999 and mszros 2002 . ) a crucial advance in understanding gamma - ray bursts began with the discovery of `` afterglows '' , starting with _ bepposax _ observations in the soft x - ray band of grb 970228 ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ; wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ) .",
    "( for a review of grb afterglows see van paradijs , kouveliotou , & wijers 2000 . )",
    "if grbs were isotropic , then the measured redshifts would imply total explosion energies of @xmath5 ergs ( frail et al .",
    ". theoretical work on relativistic jet expansion , however , shows that one expects a steepening in the decay light curve if one is looking down the axis of a jet as the flow decelerates from a bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the jet beaming angle ( e.g. , rhoads 1997 , sari , piran , & halpern 1999 , panaitescu & mszros 1999 , panaitescu & kumar 2001ab , 2002 ) .",
    "one does in fact see such steepenings in the light curves ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "1999 ; harrison et al .",
    "prior to the time when @xmath8 the expansion is effectively `` spherical '' from the observer s viewpoint because the relativistic beaming is narrower than the jet itself . in other words",
    ", if the grb emission were coming from one spot on a large , relativistically expanding sphere , aimed directly at the observer , the observer would not see any emission from the other parts of the sphere .",
    "after the time when @xmath8 the observer can `` see '' the entire jet , and a faster rate of decline in the luminosity is predicted .",
    "a separate issue that we will address in this work is the sideways or lateral expansion of the jet as the increasing solid angle of the jet enables a larger fraction of the circumstellar medium ( csm ) surrounding the progenitor star to be intercepted and provide decelerating gas .",
    "several groups have claimed that this leads to a faster ( exponential ) decrease in @xmath2 , which acts as an additional agent to diminish the amplitude of the relativistic beaming .",
    "the concept of a `` break '' in the afterglow light curves occurring when @xmath8 has been used to infer the presence of strong beaming in grbs ( frail et al .",

    "( 2001 ) utilize the theoretical framework of sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) which takes the jet evolution to be spherical adiabatic expansion to show that , after correcting the `` isotropic '' energies to account for the specific beaming factor for each burst , the total burst energy reduces to a narrow range centered on @xmath9 ergs .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) give a tabulation of 17 afterglows for which redshifts had been measured , up to 2001 january .",
    "the redshifts range from 0.433 to 4.5 . of these",
    ", 10 also have break times known to within @xmath10% , ranging from 1 d to 25 d. ( in addition , three grbs have listed lower limits on the break time , and two have listed upper limits . )",
    "the combination of redshifts , fluences , and break times lead to estimates of the jet angles @xmath1 ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , with an aggregation near @xmath13 .",
    "( the number of grb s with redshift determinations is currently @xmath14 . for an update of the work described in frail et al .",
    "2001 , see berger , kulkarni , & frail 2003 . )",
    "prior investigations of grb jet expansion have been largely analytical , or involved computational models with some imposed symmetry , typically spherical or axial ( e.g. , rhoads 1997 , 1999 ; sari 1997 , sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ; granot , piran , & sari 1999a ; kumar & panaitescu 2000ab ; panaitescu & kumar 2001ab , 2002 ; granot et al .",
    "these works have tended for the most part to confirm estimates and scalings based on the analytical formalism of blandford & mckee ( 1976=bm76 ) , although for many of the studies the agreement is ( to some extent ) circular , given that they rely at least in part on the bm76 formalism .",
    "kobayashi , piran , & sari ( 1999 ) present results based on a spherically symmetric relativistic lagrangian code .",
    "they identify three regimes during the evolution of the grb jet : ( i ) an acceleration phase during which @xmath15 and @xmath2 increases rapidly to a large value @xmath16 , ( ii ) a coasting phase during which @xmath2 is relatively constant as the mass accumulated from the csm is small compared to that in the jet , and ( iii ) a deceleration phase during which the accumulated mass forces a rapid decrease in @xmath2 .",
    "previous studies using analytical methods divided the evolution into regimes defined by some ordering of distance , velocity , or energy scales ( see table 3 of piran 1999 and figure 7 of mszros 2002 ) .",
    "the main findings that seem to be common to all studies are that the break in the decaying light curve @xmath17 occurs roughly when the deceleration has decreased @xmath2 to roughly the reciprocal of the jet beaming angle , and that the subsequent decrease in @xmath2 is roughly exponential with distance . also , panaitescu & mszros ( 1999 ) present axisymmetric calculations to study the combined effects of the transition from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and the lateral jet expansion .    in other subdisciplines of astronomy",
    "the use of relativistic hydrodynamics codes has been standard for some time .",

    "we study the spatial spreading of the blob both along the direction of propagation and orthogonal to it , as well as the evolution of @xmath2 in space and time .",
    "we also calculate afterglow light curves , taking a simple prescription in which the local emissivity scales with the local pressure .",
    "the model used is that of del zanna & bucciantini ( 2002=db02 ) .",
    "these authors present a simple and efficient numerical scheme for special relativistic hydrodynamics ( srhd ) that does not rely on computationally expensive spectral decomposition ( and the accompanying matrix inversions ) .",
    "the semi - discrete form of the srhd equations is solved , so that time integration can be carried out using a standard runge - kutta method .",

    "this method gives third order accuracy by adaptively adjusting the `` stencil '' , or spatial interval , used for computing differences in the vicinity of a given cell .",
    "db02 present two versions of the fluxes , * f*@xmath22 , where `` hll '' denotes harten , lax , & van leer ( 1983 ) , that are precise but at the same time potentially prone to numerical instabilities , and * f*@xmath23 , where `` llf '' denotes local lax - friedrichs ( cf . lax & liu 1998 ) , that represent a smoother , numerically dissipative flux . for the main application we consider in this work we will utilize the llf fluxes .",

    "the run was halted before the expansion reached the edge of the grid . for the last three times steps , a kink develops in the @xmath33 profile at the center of the sphere because of the prolonged spherical outflow from localized point .",

    "2 , @xmath44 has increased by @xmath473 parts in @xmath48 , and @xmath45 is constant ( to within machine accuracy ) .",
    "we now present results for the case of interest , namely a relativistic blob of material that expands roughly axisymmetrically ( orthogonal to the direction of motion ) as it decelerates from ultrarelativistic to relativistic speeds .",
    "we set up our initial problem as follows : our blob is made to propagate along the positive @xmath35axis through a 3d rectangular grid of @xmath49 cells .",
    "the box measures 5 units along the @xmath50 axis , and 1 unit each along the @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes .",
    "therefore the grid spacing along each axis is 0.01 units .",
    "we explore a variety of configurations for our initial state .",
    "we performed runs in which the blob initially is either a small cone , sphere , or plate , with symmetry about the propagation vector .",
    "the dimensions of the initial blob are optimized , according to its shape , so that @xmath26 grid points out of the @xmath53 in the computational domain initially comprise the blob .",
    "an initial spread is imparted to each fluid element by setting the @xmath51 and @xmath52 components of velocity such that @xmath54 .",

    "we divide this value by two to obtain the half - angle spread @xmath56 radian .",
    "the blob is given a lorentz factor @xmath57 so that the relativistic beaming angle @xmath3 lies within the physical spreading angle @xmath1 of the jet .",
    "we set @xmath58 ( inside the blob ) , @xmath59 ( outside the blob ) , and @xmath60 .",
    "we also perform one trial with @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 at all points .",
    "this is the `` null hypothesis '' run . the effective density contrast perceived in the lab ( i.e. , csm ) frame is @xmath63",
    ". soon after the computation starts , the initial profile relaxes to one in which @xmath64 , therefore the effective density contrast for the early run is @xmath65 .",
    "this is less than expected astrophysically , but required in our computations in order to see significant deceleration of the blob by the time it reaches the end of the grid @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , we must telescope the evolution into the finite dimensions of our grid . from conservation of momentum",
    ", the condition for significant deceleration is that the total swept - up mass - energy roughly equals that in the initial blob .",
    "experimentation using hll fluxes shows that strong internal shocks almost immediately create large - amplitude sawtooth @xmath32 variations within the blob , leading to noisy results .",
    "therefore we utilize the smoother llf fluxes in this work .",
    "we follow the evolution of the blob in terms of both its motion in @xmath50 and its spreading in @xmath51 and @xmath52 . taking a courant number of @xmath67 necessitates @xmath68 time steps for the blob to reach the end of the grid , traveling at @xmath69 .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the box length and grid spacing @xmath70 , from which it follows that the time to traverse the box is @xmath71 units traveling at @xmath72 .",
    "a density contrast of @xmath73 is sufficient to see the desired deceleration from @xmath74 to @xmath75 during a run .    in order to avoid undue complexity in these experiments , that currently are purely hydrodynamic and do not yet contain proper prescriptions for emission from bremsstrahlung and synchrotron processes , we calculate a simple measure of the emissivity by taking the local emission to scale as @xmath34 , which would be expected roughly for optically thin synchrotron emission characteristic of frequencies significantly above the self - absorption frequency .",
    "we avoid the issues of synchrotron self - absorption ( granot , piran , & sari 1999b , 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ) , and of whether the evolution is adiabatic or radiative ( panaitescu & mszros 1998b ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) @xmath40 our calculations are adiabatic .",
    "we calculate effective `` light curves '' for observers at various viewing angles between @xmath76 and @xmath77 from the center of the jet .",
    "the amplification of the photon energy flux is dictated by three factors : ( 1 ) the rate of photon emission is increased by a factor of @xmath2 as one goes from the blob frame to the lab frame .",
    "( 2 ) the individual photons are doppler - shifted so that their lab frame energy is increased by a factor of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the angle between the line of sight and blob s direction of motion .",
    "( 3 ) the photons are focused in the direction of motion , so that an angle of emission ( relative to the direction of motion ) in the blob s frame , @xmath80 , is related to the lab frame angle @xmath79 by @xmath81 .",
    "the differential solid angle @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "thus , the net amplification of the photon energy flux for each fluid element is @xmath83 , similar expressions have been derived previously ( e.g. , granot , piran , & sari 1999a , eqns . [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ; wang , & loeb 2001 , eqns . [ 13 ] , [ 31 ] ) .",
    "the formalisms of granot et al ( 1999a ) and wang & loeb ( 2001 ) also contain a provision for time delays based on the relative positions and velocities of different fluid elements .",
    "the `` time '' of interest in summing the relative emission contributions is the retarded time @xmath84 .",
    "we compute light curves by keeping running totals of the contributions to the flux from 100 slices through the computational domain ( straddling the position of local disturbance in the fluid caused by the advancing blob ) that are orthogonal to the blob velocity vector ( i.e. , cuts in the @xmath85 plane ) and advance in time toward the observer at @xmath86 . over the course of a run",
    "we build up a light curve based on constant retarded times with respect to the observer .",
    "this approach is essential insofar as the photons emitted by a given fluid element outpace the blob itself only slightly .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of physical quantities for the run which begins with a small cone along a cut through the center of the computational box , along the direction of propagation of the blob .",
    "the initial conditions quickly disappear and give way to the deceleration phase noted by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . during the entire evolution",
    "there is a local maximum in @xmath34 in advance of the propagating blob that accompanies the leading pile - up in density .",
    "the region of highest @xmath2 lies within the density minimum that lies just behind this shocked region .",
    "although the initial pressure is small , after the bow shock is fully developed we have @xmath87 throughout the subsequent evolution .",
    "the evolution proceeds in a roughly self - similar manner and the forward / reverse shock system is stable , in accord with analytic estimates ( wang , loeb , & waxman 2002 ) .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show a time series of contour plots in @xmath2 and @xmath32 that follow the blob propagation and radial spreading .",
    "the full 500 grid points along the @xmath50 direction are shown , and each frame represents 240 time steps ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",
    "the leading contours show the density enhancement associated with the shock .",
    "the @xmath32 contours indicate the values 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , while the ( trailing ) @xmath2 contours , indicate values of 1.25 , 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 .",
    "the contours are formed by taking a cut at @xmath89 through the @xmath90 plane .",
    "the initial velocity vector of the blob points toward the top of the plot , with @xmath57 .",
    "one sees a strong bow shock associated with the maximum in pressure at the point where the blob encounters the csm .",
    "the lack of a bow shock in the @xmath2 contours suggests that little or no material in advance of the blob is accelerated to a significant bulk lorentz factor .",
    "as the evolution progresses the deceleration causes the higher @xmath2 contours to disappear , and those that remain become increasingly distorted .",
    "the bilateral symmetry of the contours evident in figures 4 and 5 attests to the power of the third order differencing scheme given in db02 , insofar as the 3d model has no enforced symmetry .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolution of the total rest - mass energy @xmath44 ( dotted ) and total energy @xmath45 ( dashed ) within the grid , over the course of the conical run .",
    "the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been normalized to their initial values .",
    "the curves that extend significantly below an abscissa value of unity indicate the values summed over the grid . at the six faces of the computational box we continually reset the values of all variables to their initial values , and keep track of the differences between those values and the initial ones .",
    "as the run progresses and more high velocity gas reaches the edge of the computational domain and is extracted , there is a net extraction of positive @xmath44 and @xmath45 from the grid .",
    "in addition , there is a low density wake that trails the blob , and therefore at the contact points between the wake and the sides of the grid there is a net extraction of negative @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "from a practical standpoint , the density inside the wake is so small that the net extraction of negative @xmath44 and @xmath45 does not significantly affect the bookkeeping .",
    "the curves in figure 6 that lie close to an abscissa value of unity indicate the summed values for @xmath44 and @xmath45 corrected for both net extracted positive and negative rest - mass energies .",
    "the second panel of figure 6 gives an expanded view of the first panel around the abscissa value of unity .",
    "after doing the bookkeeping on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the extracted gas , conservation of total rest - mass energy and total energy are good to within @xmath91 parts in @xmath92 .",
    "figure 7 shows values of total rest - mass energy within selected high @xmath2 cuts through the computational domain for the initially conical run , and the evolution of the @xmath35component of momentum @xmath93 for five different runs @xmath40 the initial blob as a plate ( `` p1 '' and `` p2 '' ) , sphere ( `` s '' ) , cone ( `` c '' ) , and cone with zero spreading ( `` @xmath94 '' ) .",
    "the weighting function used in evaluating @xmath93 is @xmath95 .",
    "the run p2 uses fewer grid points ( @xmath96 ) than the other runs , thus material shunted aside by the bow shock reaches the edges of the computational domain earlier . in spite of this , the evolution of p1 and p2 is quite similar , i.e. , there is no dynamically significant back reaction on the material inside the computational domain induced by the departing fluid .",
    "as we detail in the discussion section , the drag force on the blob increases as the effective area presented by the blob , which for a roughly constant lateral spreading goes as @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the integral of the relativistic impulse equation @xmath98 provides a solution of the form @xmath99 , where our fitting for the conical run ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ) is shown by the curve labeled `` @xmath103 '' .",
    "the curves in figure 7 showing the variation of the rest - mass energy contained within different @xmath2 cuts follow the values @xmath104 1.001 , 1.01 , 1.1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 . the higher @xmath2 cuts @xmath105 reveal that a negligible fraction of csm matter gets accelerated to significant values .",
    "this is because the curved bow shock shunts material laterally in front of the advancing blob , rather than accelerating it up to a significant fraction of the blob s bulk lorentz factor @xmath106 .",

    "the total accumulated csm gas becomes comparable to that in the initial blob .",
    "if the blob did not spread laterally , this time would occur when the blob had plowed through a density @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the blob would have shed of order its initial momentum by the time it had traveled @xmath65 times its initial length @xmath111 , or @xmath112 units . in practice",
    ", the initially imposed tangential velocity @xmath113 leads to the lateral expansion that effectively increases the cross section for interaction of the blob .",
    "the negligible decrease in @xmath93 for the @xmath94 run demonstrates the importance of this effect .",
    "figure 8 shows the lateral expansion of the blob for the conical run .",
    "the blob edge is computed in each time step by first finding the local maximum in either @xmath32 , @xmath2 , or @xmath114 along the @xmath35axis , and then stepping laterally to the position at which the background ( csm ) value of the relevant quantity has been increased by 10% due to expansion of the blob .",
    "the transient lateral expansion @xmath115 lasting until @xmath116 is unphysical insofar as it occurs during the period of adjustment to the initial density and velocity profiles .",
    "the value of the later spreading rate @xmath117 is basically dictated by the initial @xmath113 value given to the gas .",
    "figure 9 shows the evolution of @xmath93 and @xmath1 as the blob propagates .",
    "the solid curve in the top panel indicates the same weighted value of @xmath93 as shown in fig .",

    "we find a change in the form of the luminosity decrease corresponding to the transition between spherical and jetlike expansion .",

    "because the deceleration in our problem is forced not by the accumulation of gas from the csm but rather the drag force of the csm on the blob , we do not see an exponential decrease in @xmath2 with distance during the deceleration phase , but rather a decrease well - approximated by a cubic dependence that is expected for a roughly constant lateral spreading rate .",
    "many of the previous studies , utilizing the formalism of bm76 in which matter accreted from the csm is added onto the grb shell and facilitates the deceleration , have discussed the sideways expansion of the jet that supposedly occurs near the time that most of the initial kinetic energy of the blob has been shed .",
    "( a qualitative depiction of this effect is shown in fig . 1 of piran 2002 . )",
    "our results do not appear to support this viewpoint .",
    "we find that the csm gas hitting the bow shock does not add significantly to the mass of the jet , but rather is swept back into its wake as the blob passes a given location . in this sense , the relevant factor in determining the deceleration is simply the projected csm surface density relative to that in the blob . as a result , there is no runaway phase of rapid lateral expansion @xmath40 a physical process that has been `` built in '' to some previous theories .",
    "we do not see an abrupt jump in the lateral spreading coincident with the deceleration phase ; the lateral spreading rate is mandated basically by the initial @xmath113 value imparted to the gas .",
    "the pressure - driven lateral expansion is negligible until such time as @xmath168 , which for @xmath169 is so late as to be uninteresting . in the aforementioned works there is a close connection between the transition @xmath170 and the change from spherical to jetlike emission , whereas in our study",
    "there is not .",
    "the break in the light curve produced by emission from the bow shock is due solely to the lessening of relativistic beaming brought about by a slow , uniformly increasing drag from the csm , and the fact that once @xmath3 becomes less than @xmath1 , the observer perceives the finite width of the jet .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) estimates that the lateral spreading speed of the jet should be @xmath171 .",
    "sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) argue for a faster spreading rate @xmath172 .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) divides the dynamical evolution of the blob into two regimes , characterized by a power law decay ( in time ) of the bulk lorentz factor , followed by an exponential decay . during the latter stage , the swept - up mass increases exponentially in time .",
    "panaitescu & mszros ( 1999 ) calculate light curves for observers at varying angles from the jet axis , and calculate separately the effects of including and excluding the lateral jet expansion .",
    "they find that the maxima in the light curves occur substantially later in runs which do not take into account the jet broadening ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . in the analytical models of both rhoads ( 1999 ) and",
    "panaitescu & mszros ( 1999 ) , the physics of mass accumulation from the csm is an integral component of the formalism ; all mass within the solid angle of the expanding shell is assumed to accrete .",
    "workers have applied the results of rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) to the afterglow evolution , however the results of zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) cast doubt on the validity of this exercise , because at the time corresponding to the afterglow emission one anticipates that @xmath173 and the lateral spreading rate would not be governed by the internal sound speed but rather the ballistic motions of the ejecta comprising the blob as they leave the vicinity of the progenitor star .",
    "the blob has a large internal thermal energy @xmath174 as it emerges from the progenitor star , and even by the time the expanding ejecta have become optically thin to their own emission from internal shocks ( producing the grb ) , one still expects @xmath175 . by the ( much later ) time of the afterglow emission ,",
    "however , the blob would have cooled to the point that @xmath176 , which provides the impetus for our initial condition @xmath177 . following the arguments of rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) ,",
    "if the lateral spreading rate were mandated by the internal sound speed , then in our calculations it should be @xmath178 , whereas we find it to be @xmath139 times larger .",
    "the spreading rate basically reflects our initial @xmath113 value .",
    "thus the physics of the lateral expansion is different than in rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) .",
    "how might this result be influenced by systematic effects present in our model ?",
    "one obvious potential shortcoming is the absence of cooling . in this work",
    "we have assumed an adiabatic gas , whereas in reality one might envision the presence of cooling within the shock .",
    "this might then reduce the ability of the shock to deflect the gas as efficiently as it now does , which in our model prevents the acceleration of csm material to lorentz factors approaching that of the blob .",
    "we adopt a relatively small density contrast between material inside the blob and the exterior csm in order to see significant evolution of the blob during the course of the simulation within our eulerian grid .",
    "we have run additional models using @xmath179 , and although these could not be run for sufficient time to see the deceleration phase begin , we find in these runs also a lateral spreading rate @xmath180 , for the same initial @xmath113 values , and negligible accretion of gas from the csm .",
    "we may understand the deceleration of the blob with a simple analytical model .",
    "if we assume that the only significant contribution to @xmath181 is through forward motion , that the drag force varies as @xmath182 , and that @xmath183 , then @xmath184 implies    @xmath185    where @xmath186 , @xmath187 is the cross sectional area for interaction @xmath188 , @xmath189 is the ( constant ) lateral spreading speed ( @xmath180 in our calculations ) , and @xmath190 is a dimensionless number ( typically of order 0.2 in laboratory applications ) . taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 gives    @xmath193    where the blob mass @xmath194 .",
    "the blob volume is given by the number of cells comprising the blob initially ( @xmath26 ) times the volume of an element @xmath195 .",
    "therefore @xmath196 .",
    "integrating gives    @xmath197    where @xmath198 is the initial value of @xmath199 and @xmath200 . from the fitting to @xmath201",

    "a comparison of the curves labelled `` c '' and `` @xmath103 '' in fig .",
    "7 shows that the functional decrease in @xmath201 with @xmath50 is reasonably described by a cubic , as expected if the cross sectional area increases quadratically with @xmath50 , or equivalently @xmath203 .",
    "note that we assumed @xmath204 in this exercise , which is a good approximation for the evolution of interest .",
    "the calculations we present are the first 3d relativistic hydrodynamical calculations of grb jet evolution pertinent to the afterglow phase that do not enforce any special symmetry ( e.g. , spherical or axial ) .",
    "we find that ( i ) the csm gas does not accrete onto the advancing blob , but rather is shunted aside by the bow shock , ( ii ) the decay light curve steepens roughly when one first `` sees '' the edge of the jet @xmath4 , with this effect being strongest for `` face - on '' observers ( confirming previous studies ) , and ( iii ) the rate of decrease of the @xmath35component of momentum @xmath93 is well - characterized by a simple model in which the cross sectional area of the blob increases quadratically with laboratory time ( or distance ) .",
    "the primary impetus for the built - in assumption of accretion of matter in previous studies was the influential work of bm76 in which spherical relativistic expansion was considered .",
    "accretion of gas onto the relativistically expanding shell is obviously justified for spherical expansion , but subsequent grb workers applied the results to the case of the grb jet , in which a thin wedge of material propagates through a low density medium .",
    "in such a situation the natural tendency of material in front of the jet is to be pushed aside and to form a `` channel flow '' around the jet , rather than to accrete .",
    "a separate issue is that workers used the results of rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that give lateral expansion rates of order @xmath86 to explain the phase of afterglow evolution , while it now turns out from the work of zhang et al .",
    "( 2003ab ) that the much smaller internal energy in the afterglow - producing blob would be expected to give a much lower spreading rate , were that the only relevant spreading mechanism .",
    "the evolution of the blob prior to the afterglow epoch , however , in particular its emergence from the progenitor envelope , did encompass a period of much greater @xmath141 during which a large @xmath189 was imparted to the gas . in summary , there is nothing in our results to suggest that bm76 , rhoads ( 1999 ) , and sari et al . ( 1999 ) are not internally consistent , rather it appears that the subsequent application of their results to afterglow evolution may have been inappropriate .    recent semi - analytical work has centered on `` structured '' relativistic jet modeling , wherein one replaces the `` top - hat '' assumption of uniform jet properties , e.g. , lorentz factor and @xmath141 constant within the initial cone angle , with more physically motivated forms in which the physical parameters vary with angle away from the jet symmetry axis @xmath79 ( e.g. , kumar & granot 2003 , granot & kumar 2003 ) .",
    "structured jets represent a refinement in the semi - analytical and analytical work in the sense that unphysical artifacts of the top - hat models are avoided . in this work we allow naturally occurring gradients within the flow",
    "determine the evolution .",
    "in comparing the runs with different starting conditions , for instance , we see that only the gross initial characteristics ( bulk lorentz factor and spreading rate ) are of relevance .",
    "one could impose a structured initial state , in terms of having an angle - dependent relation between , for instance lorentz factor and @xmath79 , and/or @xmath141 and @xmath79 , but one suspects that the initial intricacies would be washed out , just as the initial blob shape is .",
    "one might in fact imagine inverting the problem and using our results to determine physically motivated functional forms for @xmath205 and @xmath206 as input to a structured jet formalism , but in our models the detailed evolution of the physical parameters and the interaction of the blob with the bow shock reveal gross changes along the jet axis .",
    "therefore the motivation for trying to characterize the jet properties as simple functions of @xmath79 , averaged along the axis of the jet , seems questionable . in addition",
    ", one would still be missing important physical effects , such as the non - accretion of the forward csm material .",
    "two obvious refinements , currently being carried out , are to ( i ) treat the problem on a lagrangian grid in which the mesh points follow the blob and are adaptively inserted in regions with strong gradients , so as to be able to explore regimes in which the density contrast between the blob and csm is much larger , and ( ii ) include provisions for realistic bremsstrahlung and synchrotron physics , in order to produce light curves that can be compared directly with observations so as to test different aspects of the theory and thereby constrain the allowed parameter space .",
