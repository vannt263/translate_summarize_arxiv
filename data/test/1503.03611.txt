    "most active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show prominent fe ii  emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the lines appear in several broad bands that represent thousands of individual transitions .",
    "the stronger bands cover the ranges of 40005400   ( hereafter optical fe ii  lines ) , 28003500   and 20002600   ( hereafter uv fe ii  lines ; e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the strongest fe ii  lines ( relative to h@xmath0 ) are observed in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such objects are characterized by : 1 ) narrow ( @xmath1 2000 @xmath2 ) broad emission lines ; 2 ) weak [ o iii ]  line ; 3 ) and steep hard x - ray spectrum . these objects are found usually at the extreme end of the so - called eigenvector 1 sequence @xcite indicating high eddington ratios and several other properties that are not fully understood .    some nls1s show evidence for super - eddington accretion , with @xmath3  @xmath4 1 .",
    "we refer to these objects as super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) .",
    "our earlier work @xcite show that such objects are potentially a new kind of standard candle for cosmology . to test this idea , and to study in more detail the physical properties of extreme nls1s",
    ", we have initiated a large reverberation mapping ( rm ) campaign to measure , accurately , the black hole ( bh ) mass of such sources .",
    "the initial results of this campaign have been published in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) .",
    "the present paper , the third in this series , is dedicated to the study of fe ii  emission lines in our sample of seambh candidates .",
    "a fourth paper , submitted in parallel to this one , presents new data on h@xmath0  time lags and bh mass in five extreme seambhs and focuses on the modification of the @xmath5@xmath6  relationship in agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in the presence of such sources .",
    "the excitation mechanism of the fe ii  emission in agns has been discussed in numerous publications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most of these studies suggest an origin in the broad - line region ( blr ) but the line intensities calculated so far are in poor agreement with most observations .",
    "other suggestions connect these lines to the outer part of the central accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the agreement with observations is still poor . in particular , none of the existing models can explain , satisfactorily , the relative intensity of the uv and optical fe ii  lines and the observed fe ii  spectrum in the range 20002600  .",
    "line variability is an important tool in such studies since it can indicate , given a measured time lag relative to the continuum variations , the location of the fe ii - emitting gas .",
    "such variations have been detected in a number of sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but robust lag measurements were not obtained .",
    "this situation has changed , recently .",
    "@xcite revisited the data of pg 1700@xmath7518 from @xcite and measured the light curve of the optical fe ii  lines .",
    "they obtained a significant time lag relative to the 5100   continuum albeit with a very large uncertainty . @xcite and",
    "@xcite adopted the multivariate correlation function ( mcf ) scheme of @xcite designed for photometric rm .",
    "@xcite studied the nls1 sdssj113913.91 + 335551.1 using rm and found the fe ii  time lag is consistent with the one of the h@xmath0  line . @xcite",
    "measured optical fe ii  light curves , and time lags , for three of the objects in @xcite , one of which is the object studies by @xcite .",
    "they also find somewhat less significant fe ii  time lag for three other sources .",
    "@xcite presents a tentative fe ii  size - luminosity relation and suggest that the fe ii  emission - region size is comparable to that of the h@xmath0line .",
    "@xcite used spectroscopic measurements of optical fe ii  lines and found lags that are 1.5 and 1.9 times longer than the corresponding h@xmath0 .",
    "all these studies confirm the photoionization origin of the fe ii  lines .",
    "the success of the @xcite campaign is due both to the detailed and frequent spectroscopic observations and a novel method they used to correct for the host galaxy contribution to the optical spectra .",
    "this paper presents the results obtained , so far , to measure the time lags of the optical fe ii  lines ( hereafter fe ii  lines ) in our seambh campaign .",
    "we have attempted to detect such lags in 10 of the sources and were able to obtain statistically significant results in nine of them . in six of the newly measured sources , the fe ii  lag is entirely consistent with the h@xmath0  lag and in two others it is considerably longer .",

    "* e.g. ) , all the sources in our sample show strong fe ii  emission lines and high @xmath3 .",
    "this sample is , therefore , different from most agns in the local universe and none of the results presented below should be compared with earlier studies , like @xcite that address the general population properties .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the yunnan faint object spectrograph and camera ( yfosc ) , mounted on the lijiang 2.4 m telescope at yunnan observatory of the chinese academy of sciences .",
    "a longslit with projected width of 2@xmath95 was oriented to take the spectra of the object and a nearby non - varying comparison star simultaneously following , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the comparison star is then used as a standard for flux calibration . for the lijiang 2.4 m telescope ,",
    "the rotator is accurate and the tracking is stable .",
    "thus the object and the comparison star were kept within the slit during the typical 30 min .",
    "the distance between the object and the comparison star along the direction of slit width keeps less than 1 pixel ( 0@xmath9283 ) .",
    "grism 14 was used and yielded spectra covering the wavelength range of 38007200   with a dispersion of 1.8   pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the final spectral resolution , obtained by comparing the width of the [ o iii ]  emission line with the one measured from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) spectrum of the same object , is roughly 500 @xmath2 .",
    "all spectra are extracted in a uniform , large aperture of 8@xmath95 to minimize light losses .",
    "the flux calibration is based on the comparison of the object flux to the comparison star flux in the 2@xmath95@xmath118@xmath95 apertures",
    ". however , the host galaxy flux calibration is different because of the non - stellar image  the galaxy is extended and resolved .",
    "this can result in apparent flux variations due to variable seeing and mis - centering .",
    "this requires a different calibration procedure that has a large impact on the various light curves .",
    "appendix [ sec - host ] gives details of this procedure .",
    "the traditional method to measure the flux of the continuum and the broad emission lines , in most rm studies , is simple integration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a straight line is set between two line - free windows to define the agn continuum , and the flux of the emission line is measured by simple integration above the line .",
    "this method works well for single , strong emission lines , e.g. , h@xmath0 , because there are no ( or only weak ) other emission lines in this range and the wavelength window is narrow enough for the continuum to be approximated by a straight line . in the case of fe ii , neither condition is satisfied .",
    "fe ii  emission consists of thousands of lines that form a pseudo - continuum .",
    "the most prominent features in the optical band are two bumps between 4500 to 5500  : one between h@xmath0  and h@xmath12 , and the other on the red side of [ o iii]@xmath135007 . even for quasars ,",
    "whose host galaxies are extremely faint relative to the agn , it is hard to find `` pure '' continuum windows , and it is inappropriate to assume a straight line over such a wide wavelength range of more than 1000  . the strong host galaxy contribution in most of our objects , and the contamination by other emission lines ( e.g. , he ii  and coronal lines ) , make the situation much worse . appendix [ sec - feintg ] presents the fe ii  light curves measured by the traditional integration method .",
    "all light curves have large scatter , and only less than a half show rough structures .",
    "a simultaneous fitting including the fe ii  emission and all the other spectral components is necessary .",
    "template - fitting is a widely used method to measure fe ii  emission in single - epoch spectra of agns ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a brief overview ) .",
    "input - output simulations show that template - fitting is a reliable measurement of fe ii  emission with equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath4 25   in quasars @xcite .",
    "it is also common to include a host galaxy component into the fitting of type i agns with strong host contribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the method has been adopted , recently , to measure the light curves in a few reverberation mapping studies , and proved to be successful .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the spectra of pg 1700@xmath7518 , using data from @xcite .",
    "they detected a lag of @xmath14 days for fe ii  emission .",
    "@xcite performed a very careful spectral decomposition including a power - law continuum , a host galaxy component , fe iitemplate , and other emission lines ( h@xmath0 , [ o iii ] , he ii , and he i ) . using this technique",
    "they were able to obtain statistically significant reverberation lags of the fe ii  lines in two seyfert 1 galaxies , ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 .",
    "the spectral fitting in the present paper follows the algorithm of @xcite , where several spectral components are fitted simultaneously by minimizing the @xmath15  via levenberg - marquardt method .",
    "all the light curves are obtained directly from the results of the fitting . before fitting ,",
    "we correct the calibrated spectra for galactic extinction and redshift .",
    "we use the @xmath16-dependent galactic extinction law given by @xcite and @xcite and @xmath16 is assumed to be 3.1 . the redshift @xmath17 and @xmath18-band extinction",
    "are taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and @xcite , as listed in papers i and ii .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig - spec382 ] shows the fitting to the spectrum of mrk 382 taken at julian date ( jd ) 2456298 , after galactic extinction and redshift correction .",
    "the fitting is performed in the rest frame wavelength range 41506280  , except two narrow windows around h@xmath12  and he i@xmath135876 .",
    "the two lines are not blended with the major part of fe iiemission , and their study is beyond the scope of the present paper . we keep them out of the fitting to avoid introducing too many unnecessary parameters .",
    "the observed spectra in the fitting windows are plotted in green , while those left out of the fitting are in black .",
    "the fitting includes the following components : ( 1 ) a single power law , ( 2 ) fe ii  emission , ( 3 ) host galaxy .",
    "these three components , which when combined together forms the pseudo - continuum , are plotted in blue .",

    "the summed model is plotted in red .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residual spectrum .",

    "d ) absorption lines from the host galaxy .    limited by the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for the individual - night spectra , there are degeneracies between several pairs of spectral components , including : ( a ) the agn power - law continuum and the host galaxy ; ( b ) fe iiemission and the broad he ii  line ; ( c ) fe ii  emission and the coronal lines .",
    "thus , we first fit the high - s / n _ mean spectrum _ with all parameters set free .",
    "we then fit each individual - night spectrum with the values of some parameters fixed to those obtained from the fitting of the mean spectrum .",
    "the details of each spectral component , and the fitting parameters , are described in the following subsections .",
    "a single power law is used to describe the featureless agn continuum .",
    "it has two parameters : the flux density at 5100   ( @xmath20 ) , and the spectral index ( @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 ) .",
    "there is some degeneracy between the power - law continuum and the host galaxy .",
    "a larger @xmath21 or a higher - flux galaxy ( @xmath23 ) both make the total spectrum redder ( note that the unphysical change in the color of the observed spectrum caused by weather or differential atmospheric refraction is avoided in our observation , as our flux calibration by the comparison star provides differential spectrophotometry in each wavelength bin of the spectrum ; see section [ sec - reduction ] ) .",
    "for our observations , we find that the _ relative flux _ of the galaxy component is the main reason for the change in the total - spectrum slope .",
    "figure [ fig - spec382 ] illustrates this point .",
    "the right panel shows the spectrum of mrk 382 taken at jd 2456299 , just one day after the date of the spectrum shown in the left panel .",
    "apparently , the flux at 5100   is @xmath2430% higher than the day before , and the color is redder .",
    "however , the difference between the @xmath18-band magnitudes of the two nights is only @xmath240.01 mag .",
    "we have therefore adopted an approach based on the assumption that the absolute flux of the host must be constant but the relative flux inside the slit can vary depending on the observing conditions .",
    "this is illustrated in detail in appendix [ sec - host ] .",
    "the conclusion about the agn continuum is in line with several , but not all studies discussing the relation between @xmath21 and luminosity in agns .",
    "most recently , @xcite investigated this issue using the reverberation mapping data of the 17 quasars from @xcite .",
    "they found no strong dependence of @xmath21 on the variability of the luminosity .",
    "thus , in the fitting of each individual - night spectrum , we fix the value of @xmath21 to agree with the best fit to the mean spectrum , and let @xmath20  and @xmath23  free . comparing the left and right panels of figure [ fig - spec382 ] , only the galaxy component changes . in this way ,",
    "the resultant @xmath20  light curve matches the @xmath18-band light curve well ( see appendix [ sec - host ] ) .",
    "our fitting is consistent with no changes in spectral index as a function of luminosity .",
    "there are several optical fe ii  templates available in the literature . among them , two templates , from @xcite and @xcite , are most widely used , both constructed from the spectrum of the nls1 galaxy i zw 1 .",
    "@xcite find that the template from @xcite yields inconsistent he i  emission lines ; significant broad he i  @xmath134922 and @xmath135016 emission lines are needed while he i  @xmath134471 is constrained to have zero flux by the fitting .",
    "we compared these two templates and found that the one from @xcite gives better fitting as judged by the smaller reduced @xmath15 .",
    "no broad he",
    "i  @xmath134922 and @xmath135016 emission lines are needed , which is consistent with the zero flux of he i@xmath134471 .",
    "introducing the two broad he i  lines will add more parameters to the fit and will introduce additional degeneracy between he i@xmath134922 and h@xmath0 .",
    "given this , we chose the fe ii  template from @xcite in this paper .",
    "the fe ii  template is convolved with a gaussian function to be scaled , broadened , and shifted ( see * ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "three parameters , the flux ( @xmath25 ) , the full width at half - maximum ( @xmath26 ) , and shift ( @xmath27 ) , are used for fe ii  emission in the fitting .",
    "we let all the three parameters to be free in the fitting of each individual - night spectrum .",
    "note that , @xmath25  is defined as the flux of the integrated fe ii  emission between 4434 and 4684   from the best - fit fe ii  model , following @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution of our spectra is rather low ( @xmath24500 @xmath2 ) , and in addition our objects are selected to have narrow h@xmath0  emission lines .",
    "thus , it is hard to decompose the h@xmath0  emission line and remove the narrow component that comes from the narrow - line region .",
    "considering that the contribution of the narrow component is weak and supposed to be constant over reverberation timescales @xcite , we treat the entire h@xmath0  emission line as one component .",
    "the entire h@xmath0  profile is modeled by a gauss - hermite function @xcite .",
    "all the five parameters of the gauss - hermite function are set free in the fitting of each individual - night spectrum .",
    "the flux of the line ( @xmath28 ) is calculated from the best - fit model .      besides the strong [ o iii ]  @xmath194959 , 5007",
    ", there are many other narrow emission lines in the wavelength range of our fit spectrum @xcite .",
    "we identify narrow he ii  @xmath134686 , he i@xmath134471 , and several high - ionization forbidden coronal lines . in some objects ,",
    "these narrow lines are so strong that their contamination is non - negligible to the fe ii  measurement .",
    "figure [ fig - spec335 ] shows an individual - night spectrum of mrk 335 and our fit .",
    "the strong coronal lines include in this case [ fe vii ]  @xmath135158 , [ fe vi ]  @xmath135176 , [ n i]@xmath135199 , [ ca v ]  @xmath135309 , [ fe vii ]  @xmath135721 , and [ fe vii]@xmath136086 .",
    "adding these lines significantly improve the fit .",
    "the intensities of the narrow lines differ from one object to the next . for each object , we first identify narrow lines in the mean spectrum by testing the goodness of fit . only lines that are identified in the mean spectrum are included in the fitting of individual - night spectra .",
    "each narrow emission line is modeled by a gaussian .",
    "these lines are coming from the narrow - line region and hence do not vary on the campaign time scale .",
    "thus , we constrain them to have the same velocity width and shift with those of the [ o iii ]  @xmath135007 line .",
    "the flux ratio relative to [ o iii ]  @xmath135007 is also kept constant , as given by the best fit to the mean spectrum ( the flux ratio of [ o iii]@xmath134959 to @xmath135007 is fixed to the theoretical value of 1/3 ) , in order to avoid the degeneracy between these lines and fe ii .",
    "only the flux , velocity width , and shift of [ o iii ]  @xmath135007 are set free .",
    "the broad he ii  @xmath134686 emission line is strong in the spectrum of some objects in our sample .",
    "figure [ fig - spec335 ] shows an example .",
    "the line , plotted in cyan , is much broader than h@xmath0 , and strongly blueshifted .",
    "such a line profile is common for high - ionization lines in nls1s and consistent with that of the ultraviolet ( uv ) he ii  @xmath131640 line in sdss spectra @xcite .",
    "it is even more prominent in the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectra of our objects , indicating large variability similar to the results in previous he ii  reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the broad he ii  line is heavily blended with fe ii  emission .",
    "the high - ionization lines in agn are often asymmetric @xcite , but there is no other high - ionization line in the wavelength range of our spectra to constrain the profile of he ii  line .",
    "we first fit the line profile in the mean spectrum using a single gaussian .",
    "we then kept the width and the shift in the individual - night spectra but leave the line intensity as a free parameter .",
    "the intensity variation of the he ii  lines in our sample will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "here we only note that the procedure described above seems to be consistent with the observations , and , in general , the lag of this line is much shorter than the h@xmath0  lag .",
    "following @xcite , we use single simple stellar population models from @xcite as templates for the galaxy component . for most objects in our sample , the instantaneous - burst model with an age of 11 gyr and solar metallicity ( @xmath29 ) provided sufficiently good fit to the mean spectrum and consistent flux ratio compared with the measured _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images ( see papers i and ii ) . in a few cases ( mrk 335 , mrk 142 , and mrk 42 )",

    "<S> this is the third in a series of papers reporting on a large reverberation - mapping campaign aimed to study the properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with high accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> we present new results on the variability of the optical fe ii  emission lines in 10 agns observed by the yunnan observatory 2.4 m telescope during 20122013 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect statistically significant time lags , relative to the agn continuum , in nine of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> this accurate measurement is achieved by using a sophisticated spectral fitting scheme that allows for apparent flux variations of the host galaxy , and several narrow lines , due to the changing observing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> six of the newly detected lags are indistinguishable from the h@xmath0  lags measured in the same sources . </S>",
    "<S> two are significantly longer and one is slightly shorter . combining with fe ii  lags reported in previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , we find a fe ii  radius  luminosity relationship similar to the one for h@xmath0 , although our sample by itself shows no clear correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the results support the idea that fe ii  emission lines originate in photoionized gas which , for the majority of the newly reported objects , is indistinguishable from the h@xmath0-emitting gas . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a tentative correlation between the lag and intensity of fe ii  and h@xmath0  and comment on its possible origin . </S>"
