    ". however , the practical realisation of atom - cavity quantum computing schemes usually requires @xmath0 s above @xmath7 to achieve single - operation fidelities above @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the only alternative are probabilistic quantum computing schemes .",
    "these promise fidelities above @xmath8 even when @xmath9 but rely either on the detection of single photons @xcite or on the observation of macroscopic fluorescence signals @xcite .",
    "because of being conditional , they require relatively high photon detection efficiencies and cavity mirrors with low absorption coefficients . using currently available experimental setups to entangle atoms in optical cavities with a very high fidelity therefore requires a different approach than previously proposed in the literature .",
    "recently it has been pointed out by several authors @xcite that it is possible to generate entanglement in a controlled way by simply _ cooling _",
    "qubits into well - defined , highly entangled states .",
    "the main idea behind this approach is to design laser fields such that the target state becomes the stationary state of the system .",
    "state preparation schemes based on this idea are expected to tolerate much higher spontaneous decay rates than proposals which do not use dissipation in this way . moreover , when cooling a system into an entangled state , the fidelity of the state preparation no longer depends on the initial state of the system which makes the entanglement generation more robust against errors .",

    "every ground state of the system other than the target state couples resonantly and sufficiently strong to rapidly decaying excited states .",

    "it consists of two atoms simultaneously trapped inside an optical cavity .",
    "the main decay channels in this system are the spontaneous emission of photons from the excited atomic state @xmath10 with decay rate @xmath5 and the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors with decay rate @xmath4 .",
    "both atoms are driven by external laser fields which couple respectively to the 01 and the 12 transition . in the following ,",
    "we design the detunings and rabi frequencies of these laser fields such that the stationary state of the atom - cavity system is to a very good approximation given by the maximally entangled atomic ground state @xmath11 while there is no photon inside the cavity .",
    "as we shall see below , individual laser addressing of the atoms is not required .",
    "the entangling scheme proposed in this paper uses an energy shift of the target state which is due to a non - zero atom - cavity coupling constant @xmath3 as well as spontaneous emission from excited states .",
