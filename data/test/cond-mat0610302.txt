    "one of the hallmarks of biological systems is their tremendous specificity in binding reactions between receptors and ligands . on the molecular level ,",
    "a prominent example is antigen - antibody recognition , which allows our immune system to react to pathogens in a highly specific way . although traditionally much attention has been devoted to the biochemical aspects of receptor - ligand binding , physical concepts are equally important in this context . in particular , a physical transport process is required to bring receptor and ligand to sufficient proximity for binding .",
    "a helpful concept is the notion that transport has to lead to the formation of an _ encounter complex _ , which then can react to form the final receptor - ligand complex @xcite . in the language of stochastic dynamics , the formation of the encounter complex is a first passage problem which can be treated with appropriate tools from statistical physics . in many situations ,",
    "the transport process is simple diffusion .",
    "however , more complex situations also exist , like the setup in affinity chips , where ligands are transported by hydrodynamic flow into a reaction chamber loaded with receptors @xcite .    in cell adhesion , the physical transport processes required for specific bond formation tend to be even more complex , because here receptors and ligands are attached to surfaces and their movement is determined by the dynamics of the objects they are attached to . one important example in this context are white bloods cells ,",
    "which circulate the body with the blood flow and whose receptor - mediated binding to ligand - coated walls is usually studied experimentally in flow chambers @xcite . in order to fight pathogens in the surrounding tissue , white blood cells have to extravasate from the blood vessels .",
    "initial binding is provided by transmembrane receptors from the selectin family binding to carbohydrate ligands on the vessel walls . here , the probability to form an encounter complex is determined by the translational and rotational movement of the cell as determined by hydrodynamic , thermal and other external forces .",
    "similar situations also arise in microbiology , when bacteria adhere to the intestinal wall @xcite , in malaria infection , when infected red blood cells adhere to the vessel walls @xcite , in the initial stages of pregnancy , when the developing embryo adheres to the uterus @xcite , and in biotechnology , e.g. , when sorting cells on microfluidic chips @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we address this situation theoretically by combining methods from hydrodynamics and stochastic dynamics . in",
    "we show the situation which is theoretically analyzed in the following . a spherical particle with radius @xmath0 moves with hydrodynamic flow in positive @xmath1-direction at a height @xmath2 above a wall .",
    "the simplest possible flow pattern is linear shear flow with shear rate @xmath3 . for the usual dimensions in flow chamber experiments with white blood cells ,",
    "this is the relevant flow profile . in the absence of external forces",
    ", there is no reason for the particle to drift towards the wall and the formation of an encounter complex has to rely completely on thermal diffusion . in many situations of interest , however , there are forces pushing the particle towards the wall , e.g. , gravitational or electric forces . in physiological blood flow ,",
    "cell density is high and the driving force for encounter is provided mainly be hydrodynamic or contact interactions with other cells . for the sake of computational simplicity and for conceptual clarity , here we consider the simplest case of a force driving the particle onto the wall , namely a constant gravitational force directed in negative @xmath2-direction .",
    "therefore , we introduce a mass density difference @xmath4 between the particle and the surrounding fluid . again",
    "this is the relevant situation in flow chamber experiments , which are usually done with a diluted solution of cells , thus ruling out a dominant role for cell - cell interactions .",
    "receptors are modeled as patches on the particle surface , while ligands are modeled as patches on the boundary wall .",
    "the formation of an encounter complex is then identified with the first approach of any pair of receptor and ligand patches which is smaller than a prescribed capture radius @xmath5 . the underlying stochastic process is rather complex due to position - dependent mobilities resulting from the hydrodynamic equations .    in order to solve the corresponding mean first passage time problem ,",
    "here we use computer simulations of the appropriate langevin equation .",
    "a short report of some of our results has been given before @xcite .",
    "we start in by introducing the relevant concepts from hydrodynamics at small reynolds numbers , in particular the friction and mobility matrices resulting from the stokes equation for a rigid particle in linear shear flow above a wall . in",
    "we combine these results with concepts from stochastic dynamics in order to arrive at a langevin equation describing particle motion subject to hydrodynamic , gravitational and thermal forces . due to the position - dependent mobility functions",
    ", we deal with multiplicative noise , that is special care is needed to derive and interpret the noise terms . in our numerical scheme",
    "is applied to a sphere falling in shear flow .",
    "the comparison of the measured stationary height distribution function with the exact solution provides a favorable test for our numerical treatment . in",
    "we show that for the case of homogeneous coverage of sphere and wall the mean first passage time to contact can be solved exactly , again in excellent agreement with our numerical procedure . in",
    "we explain why the choice for the initial height is not essential . in the next two sections ,",
    "we present and explain our simulations results , first for movement restricted to two dimensions in and then for the full three dimensional case in .",
    "we finally conclude in by discussing the biological and biotechnological relevance of our results .",
    "due to their small sizes , the hydrodynamics of cells is in the low reynolds number regime . using a typical cell size @xmath6 m and a typical velocity v = mm / s ( that is the flow velocity at a distance @xmath7 to a wall with linear shear flow of rate @xmath8 100 hz ) , the reynolds number is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 g/@xmath11 and @xmath12 pa s are density and viscosity of water , respectively .",
    "therefore , we essentially deal with the stokes equation for incompressible fluids : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fluid velocity field , @xmath15 is the pressure field and @xmath16 is the force density on the fluid by the particle . here , we use the induced force picture , i.e. , the fluid equations of motion are extended to the interior of the particle and the particle is replaced by an appropriate force density @xmath16 acting on the fluid @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed flow field has to satisfy the homogeneous version of as well as no - slip boundary conditions at the wall . in this paper",
    ", we use the simplest possible example , namely linear shear flow , @xmath17 .",
    "the effective flow field in the region occupied by the rigid sphere reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the translational and rotational velocities of the sphere , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the position of its center , @xmath0 the sphere radius and @xmath21 the theta step - function .",
    "the particle is subject to forces and torques which follow from the force density as @xmath22 because we consider a rigid object , higher moments of the force density are not required in our context . for the unperturbed flow at the mid - point of the sphere , we make the following definitions : @xmath23 where the vector @xmath24 is called _ vorticity _ and the tensor @xmath25 _ rate of strain tensor_. because we restrict ourselves to linear shear flow , all higher moments of the unperturbed flow vanish .    due to the linearity of the stokes equation",
    ", a linear relationship exists between the force density @xmath16 and the driving flow , which is the difference between real and unperturbed flows @xcite .",
    "specified for the first moments of the force density , it leads to the relation @xmath26 where the _ shear force _",
    "@xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "it results from the perturbation of the flow by the presence of the wall and vanishes for free flow .",
    "the two matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are conveniently written as @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are the symmetric _ friction matrices _ and the superscripts t , r and d stand for _ translational _ , _ rotational _ and _ dipolar _ , respectively . in order to obtain the translational and rotational velocities of the sphere as a function of the hydrodynamic forces and torques",
    ", we have to invert : @xmath33\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symmetric matrix @xmath34 is called _",
    "mobility matrix_. it is convenient to define the mobility tensors through @xmath35 in order to calculate the friction and mobility tensors for the special case of a sphere in linear shear flow above a wall , we follow the procedure from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the friction tensors @xmath32 introduced in and the mobility tensors @xmath36 introduced in are expressed in terms of scalar functions together with irreducible tensors formed form the kronecker symbol @xmath37 , the levi - civita symbol @xmath38 and the normal vector @xmath39 .",
    "the scalar friction and mobility functions are not known analytically , but can be obtained to high accuracy by the following numerical scheme .",
    "one introduces the variable @xmath40 , where @xmath0 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath2 is its height above the wall .",
    "thus , @xmath41 can take values from the interval @xmath42 $ ] . in the limit @xmath43 , that is far away from the wall",
    ", one can expand the friction functions in powers of @xmath41 . in the limit @xmath44 , that is close to the wall",
    ", analytical results can be obtained with lubrication theory . in order to cover the whole interval ,",
    "the two limit solutions are matched using a pad summation scheme @xcite .",
    "more details of this implementation are given in appendix [ appendix : mobility ] .",
    "in contrast to the tabulated finite element results from ref .",
    "@xcite , this implementation gives correct results for any possible configuration .",
    "the motion of a particle subject to thermal , hydrodynamic and direct external forces like gravity is called _ stokesian dynamics _ @xcite . in this section",
    "we derive the corresponding stochastic differential equation ( _ langevin equation _ ) .",
    "the langevin equation will allow us to base our statistical treatment on the repeated simulation of individual trajectories . because we are interested in the over - damped ( stokes )",
    "limit , we can neglect inertia in newton s second law : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are hydrodynamic , direct and thermal forces acting on the sphere .",
    "an analogous balance exists for the torques . for the following , forces and torques as described above",
    "are united in one symbol .",
    "for example , from now on the symbol @xmath49 denotes @xmath50 , a six - dimensional vector comprising force @xmath49 and torque @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denotes the six - dimensional particle translational / rotational velocity vector .",
    "+ in the absence of brownian forces , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "inserting this into then gives @xmath55 and the particle trajectory can be found with a simple euler algorithm as @xmath56 .    in the presence of brownian motion , the situation is more complex , because thermal noise leads to terms of the order @xmath57 and special care has to be taken to include all terms up to order @xmath58 . due to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , for our problem gaussian white noise reads @xmath59 here , the subscript @xmath41 corresponds to the fact that the thermal force @xmath60 is a random process . the left part of states that the forces that the fluid exerts on the particles are equally distributed in all directions so there is no net drift due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the right part of states that forces at different times are not correlated , which is a good approximation because the diffusive forces act on a much faster time scale than the hydrodynamic forces .",
    "because the mobility matrix @xmath61 is position - dependent , we deal with so - called _ multiplicative noise_. since the @xmath62-correlation in can be considered to be the limit of a process with an intrinsic time scale for thermal relaxation , which is much faster than the time scale of hydrodynamic movement , the stratonovich interpretation of the stochastic process is appropriate @xcite .",
    "this means that for each time step , the mobility functions have to be evaluated at @xmath63 ( rather than at @xmath64 as in the it interpretation ) .",
    "the stratonovich interpretation also implies that the rules for integration and coordinate transformation are the same as for the riemann integral in non - stochastic calculus .",
    "the presence of the thermal noise converts the position function @xmath64 into a random process @xmath65 .",
    "multiplicative noise can result in additional drift terms .",
    "we therefore write the langevin equation as @xmath66 where in comparison to the deterministic equation we have added both the gaussian white noise @xmath67 ( to be interpreted in the stratonovich sense ) and some drift term @xmath68 .",
    "the drift term @xmath68 can be derived by requiring to be equivalent to the appropriate smoluchowski equation .",
    "the details of these calculations are given in appendix [ appendix : gradient_term ] .",
    "the result is @xmath69 for additive noise , that is for position - independent mobility functions , the additional drift term would vanish . in the case of position - dependent mobility matrices , the noise term @xmath67 alone would lead to a drift of the particle towards regions of lower mobility ( that is towards the wall , where mobility vanishes due to the no - slip boundary condition ) .",
    "this drift , however , is exactly compensated by the additional term @xmath68 .    for the following ,",
    "it is useful to non - dimensionalize . for length , the natural scale is sphere radius @xmath0 . for time , we use @xmath70 , which is the time needed to diffuse the distance @xmath0 . for force , we use @xmath71 , the stokes force at velocity @xmath72 , that is in linear shear flow a distance @xmath0 away from the wall .",
    "the scalar friction and mobility functions appearing in @xmath61 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 , also become dimensionless as explained in appendix [ appendix : mobility ] .",
    "the langevin equation now reads @xmath73 where the _ pclet number _ @xmath74 measures the relative importance of deterministic to brownian motion . in the limit",
    "@xmath75 the particle only exhibits diffusive motion and in the limit @xmath76 it is no longer subjected to diffusion .",
    "the second dimensionless parameter @xmath77 measures the relative importance of direct forces / torques versus the shear force / torque . measuring the time in units of the diffusive time scale is appropriate for pclet numbers of order ten or less . for simulations with larger pclet numbers it is more suitable to scale time with the inverse shear rate @xmath78",
    "this has the effect of dividing by @xmath79 .    in order to solve numerically",
    ", it has to be discretized with respect to time .",
    "the appropriate euler algorithm can be derived by first rewriting in the it - version , which adds another drift term to the equation .",
    "as explained in appendix [ appendix : euler ] , the two drift terms together lead to the result @xmath80 its discretized version is simply @xmath81\\delta t + { { \\mathbf g}}(\\delta t ) + \\mathcal{o}(\\delta t^2)\\ .\\ ] ] this final result has been derived before in a different way by brady and bossis @xcite . for vanishing shear flow",
    ", it also agrees with the classical result by ermak and mccammon @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : euler ] , we describe the algorithms used to implement , in particular the algorithm to generate the thermal forces @xmath82 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we consider a sphere whose density is slightly larger than that of the fluid . due to this density difference",
    "@xmath4 a constant drift towards the wall exists .",
    "as we will see later , this drift ensures that on average the sphere will bind to the wall in finite time .",
    "the two independent parameters defined in for this model system are @xmath79 and @xmath83 , with the earth acceleration constant @xmath84 m / s@xmath85 . for later considerations , it is convenient to introduce also the parameter @xmath86 , which we call the _ pclet number in @xmath2-direction_. @xmath79 and @xmath87 represent the strengths of the hydrodynamic and gravitational forces in respect to the thermal force , respectively . out of the three parameters @xmath79 , @xmath88 and @xmath87 , only two are independent , because @xmath89 .",
    "we first consider the path of a sphere falling in shear flow after it has been dropped at some initial height",
    ". illustrates the effect of the pclet number by showing some representative simulation trajectories .",
    "for @xmath90 the motion of the sphere is purely deterministic and only governed by the parameter @xmath88 . in the diffusive limit @xmath91",
    ", the sphere makes a pure random walk ( except for the drift in @xmath2-direction due to the gravitational force ) .",
    "as the mobility matrix does only depend on the height of the sphere above the wall ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : mobility ] ) , the motion in the @xmath2-direction is independent of the position in the @xmath92-plane and the orientation of the sphere . therefore , it can be treated separately .",
    "the probability density @xmath93 for the sphere to be at height @xmath2 at time @xmath41 is the solution to a one dimensional smoluchowski equation @xmath94 this equation can not be solved analytically as the mobility function @xmath95 is not known in closed form . in we show numerical solutions obtained by simulating the equivalent langevin equation .",
    "one clearly sees that first the @xmath62-function at @xmath96 is broadened due to diffusion and then develops into a stationary solution which has its maximum at the wall .",
    "this stationary solution has a simple analytical form which follows from by integrating @xmath97 : @xmath98 thus , the stationary solution is simply the barometric formula , as it should be for thermodynamic reasons .",
    "we also find that the first two moments ( mean and variance ) are the same : @xmath99 in the limit of vanishing gravitational force ( @xmath100 ) , the probability distribution becomes flat and the probability of finding the sphere does not peak at the wall anymore .",
    "if the sphere and the wall are homogeneously covered with receptors and ligands , respectively , an encounter complex is established whenever the sphere comes sufficiently close to the wall . the mean time which elapses after the sphere is set free at some initial position until an encounter complex is established is then identical with the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) for a sphere dropped at initial height @xmath101 to reach the height @xmath102 .",
    "note again that the motion in @xmath2-direction is independent of the values of the other coordinates . for a particle diffusing in an interval @xmath103",
    "$ ] , with @xmath102 being an absorbing boundary and @xmath104 a reflective boundary , the mfpt @xmath105 to reach @xmath102 when started at @xmath106 $ ] is the solution to the following ordinary differential equation @xcite @xmath107 in our case , @xmath108 .",
    "the drift term is @xmath109 and the diffusive term @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a scalar mobility function as explained in appendix [ appendix : mobility ] .",
    "the general solution to is @xcite @xmath112 this , can be reduced up to an integral over @xmath113 : @xmath114 thus the dependence of @xmath115 on @xmath87 , the only parameter in this problem , is obtained exactly .",
    "it is important to note that the compact form for the mfpt in is a result of the constant vertical force . for a more general vertical potential force @xmath116 with a potential @xmath117 , can be reduced to @xmath118 this equation shows that the potential must satisfy the condition @xmath119 for the mfpt to be finite .",
    "this holds true , e.g. , for the gravitational force studied here or for the interaction of a charged object with an oppositely charged wall , but not , e.g. , for a lennard - jones potential .",
    "the integral over the scalar mobility function @xmath120 can easily be calculated numerically as @xmath120 behaves well in the full range of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact @xmath121 can be approximated by its leading term from the lubrication analysis , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "we then find @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a numerical analysis shows that the approximation deviates only by a few percent from the exact solution .",
    "thus , @xmath115 is logarithmically divergent if the absorbing point is close to the wall , @xmath124 , and linearly divergent if the starting point is at infinite height , @xmath125 .    for a sphere",
    "homogeneously covered with receptors each having a capture radius @xmath5 , the mean time for forming an encounter complex is @xmath126 .",
    "this time will serve as a useful limiting result in some of the considerations presented in the next sections .",
    "the exactly known result provides also a good test for the algorithm we implemented . in a the mfpt obtained from simulation experiments and from quadrature of",
    "are compared .",
    "the two results agree very well ( see appendix [ appendix : error ] for a discussion of the statistical and systematic errors of the simulation results ) . in b",
    "we show the numerically obtained distribution of first passage times .",
    "one clearly sees that the larger @xmath87 , the stronger they peak around the mean .",
    "we conclude the case of homogenous coverage by noting that in order to obtain dimensionalized results , one has to multiply the mfpt by the diffusive time scale @xmath127 .",
    "this result does not depend on shear rate @xmath3 because vertical and horizontal motion are decoupled and rotational motion is not relevant here .",
    "however , it depends on viscosity @xmath128 , which sets the time scale for vertical motion .",
    "if one switched off thermal fluctuations , the falling time would be exactly the same as the mfpt from , but this is a special result for constant force and not true in general .",
    "if one removed the wall , the translational symmetry in @xmath2-direction would not be broken and the mfpt would be @xmath129 , that is the logarithmic term in would be missing .",
    "we now turn to spatially resolved receptor coverage , that is we consider a sphere which is covered by @xmath130 equidistantly spaced receptor patches . for the moment being , the wall is still considered to be homogeneously covered with ligands .",
    "the mfpt @xmath131 now will depend on the initial position @xmath132 and the initial orientation @xmath133 as well as on the absorbing boundary @xmath134 in diffusion space .",
    "the latter is given by the special receptor and ligand geometry .",
    "in an experimental setup with linear shear flow it is possible to measure only particles which have been initially at a certain height .",
    "this is due to the fact that their average velocity as obtained from the solution of the stokes equation depends on their height in a unique way @xcite .",
    "however , it is almost impossible to prepare a certain initial orientation @xmath133 or @xmath92-position relative to the ligands .",
    "therefore , the quantity of interest to us will be a mfpt which is averaged over all possible initial orientations @xmath133 and all initial positions @xmath92 , which will be denoted as @xmath135 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath136 on the initial height for @xmath137 can be derived exactly . for homogeneous ligand coverage",
    "the quantity of interest is @xmath138 where @xmath134 is the absorbing hyper - surface in @xmath139-space and @xmath140 a normalization constant .",
    "absorption is only possible if @xmath141 , thus if we look at some intermediate height @xmath142 , then @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the conditional probability to pass the height @xmath145 with the orientation @xmath146 when starting with the initial orientation @xmath133 at @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath147 is independent of the initial orientation and can be calculated by means of .",
    "now averaging over the initial orientation gives @xmath148t(\\vec{\\theta}_m ,    z_m | c)\\\\ \\nonumber    & = t(z_0 | z_m ) + { \\frac{1}{v_{\\vec{\\theta}}}}\\int d^3    \\vec{\\theta}_m\\ ; t(\\vec{\\theta}_m ,    z_m |",
    "c ) = t(z_0 | z_m ) + { \\langle t(\\vec{\\theta}_m , z_m | c ) \\rangle}_{\\vec{\\theta}_m}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if the orientation - averaged mfpt is known for some initial height @xmath137 , then the mfpt for any other initial height @xmath149 can be calculated by means of equations and . in , this result",
    "is verified by simulations for the two - dimensional case , that is the sphere can only move in the @xmath150-plane and rotate only around the @xmath151-axis , compare . due to the decomposition , the initial height is not essential . in the following ,",
    "we therefore will always use the value @xmath152 , that is the sphere has to fall by one radius until it hits the substrate for the first time .",
    "we now study the effect of shear rate for heterogeneous receptor distribution if the sphere is restricted to move only in two dimensions .",
    "then , the receptor patches can be equidistantly distributed over the circumference as illustrated in .",
    "each receptor patch has a capture height of @xmath5 and a width of @xmath153 .",
    "the 2d receptor density is then @xmath154 .",
    "orientation is now represented by a single angle @xmath155 .",
    "the absorbing boundary @xmath134 is illustrated in . for each receptor patch , binding can occur over a range @xmath156 , which consists of two parts .",
    "the inner part is valid already for @xmath157 and reflects the overlap due to a finite @xmath5 .",
    "the outer part is results from a finite @xmath158 .",
    "together this leads to @xmath159 .",
    "the receptor patches establish a periodicity with period @xmath160 .",
    "as the number of receptor patches grows , this period decreases and one finally achieves overlap .",
    "then , encounter becomes possible for all values of @xmath155 , that is we are back to the case of homogeneous receptor coverage . in our case of non - homogeneous coverage",
    ", the mfpt depends on @xmath161 and @xmath101 . for the following simulations @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath152",
    "is chosen unless other values are explicitly mentioned .",
    "a shows the mfpt as a function of the pclet number @xmath79 .",
    "note that in the log - log plot , an apparent plateau appears at small value of @xmath79 , although in a linear plot there would be monotonous decay .",
    "three regimes can be distinguished . for @xmath164 ( _ diffusive limit _ ) the transport by the imposed shear flow is negligible and only diffusive transport is present . for very large values of @xmath79 , @xmath165 plateaus at the value given by independent of @xmath130 . in this limit",
    "the time for rotation to any certain orientation is negligible compared to the mean time to fall down close to the wall , therefore , the result for rotational symmetry is recovered . between these two limits",
    "the mfpt decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath79 .",
    "b shows the data from a plotted as a function of the receptor density @xmath166 .",
    "the larger @xmath79 the less pronounced is the dependence of @xmath165 on @xmath130 . for @xmath164 , however , @xmath165 strongly depends on @xmath130 .",
    "the latter relation is better illustrated in c. there , at @xmath164 , @xmath165 is shown for a wide range of @xmath130 .",
    "the simulations were done for fixed patch size @xmath158 but for four different values of the capture radius @xmath5 ( cf . ) . for @xmath167",
    ", @xmath165 reaches the value given by . as described by",
    ", @xmath165 is the smaller the larger @xmath5 is .",
    "an increase in the number of receptor patches @xmath130 leads to a strong decrease for the mfpt , however , no special scaling behavior can be observed .",
    "it is remarkable that the limiting value for the case of homogeneous receptor coverage is already reached for @xmath168 .",
    "the larger the capture radius @xmath5 the more pronounced is this effect .",
    "this can be understood by observing that the effective patch size as given by the angle @xmath169 ( see ) is monotonically increasing with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "we next try to qualitatively understand the effect of shear rate for the simulation results shown in a. in general , it is very hard to separate the effects of diffusion and convection .",
    "the time for binding at @xmath164 is determined purely by diffusion effects and will be denoted by @xmath170 . as shear flow increases , the rotation of the sphere is increasingly dominated by convection .",
    "we now derive a convection time @xmath171 which competes with the diffusion time @xmath170 at large pclet number .",
    "for very large pclet number , we expect the mfpt to be the sum of the homogeneous result from plus this additional time @xmath171 .",
    "an important question then is at which @xmath79 the convection time @xmath171 become smaller than the diffusion time @xmath170 .    on order to estimate @xmath171",
    ", we note that the main effect of increased shear rate is faster rotation in the direction of flow .",
    "once a receptor has rotated by an angle @xmath160 such that it opposes a ligand on the substrate , there is some probability @xmath172 that the sphere is at the correct height that an encounter can occur .",
    "if no encounter occurs with the complementary probability @xmath173 , the sphere has to rotate about another angle @xmath174 until the next receptor points downwards .",
    "supposing the time , @xmath175 , to rotate about the angle @xmath174 is large enough that there is no correlation between the height of the sphere before and after the rotation , then , an encounter occurs again with probability @xmath172 ( therefore this analysis also does not hold at very large @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , the mean time @xmath171 for encounter is @xmath176 where the series has been summed up by means of the geometric formula . in the last term we assumed that the probability @xmath172 for the proper height is small due to a small capture distance @xmath5 .",
    "it follows from the stationary probability distribution @xmath177 given by : @xmath178 the time @xmath179 to rotate about half of the angle @xmath174 is approximately @xmath180 . therefore , we get @xmath181 in this analysis , the convection time @xmath171 scales inversely with the number of receptor patches @xmath130 and the pclet number @xmath79 . as @xmath79 increases , @xmath171 gets smaller than @xmath170 and then dominates the overall outcome . comparing to the simulation data for @xmath164 shows that this crossover occurs in the range @xmath182 and that the corresponding value of @xmath79 increases with increasing receptor number @xmath130 , exactly as observed in the simulation data over the full range of @xmath79 .",
    "however , the exact scaling of this data is not @xmath183 for large @xmath79 as predicted by . in practice ,",
    "the decay is somehow slower due to correlations between the height of the sphere at two successive instances of a receptor pointing downwards , which we have neglected in our analysis .",
    "we briefly comment on the effect of the downward driving force , that is @xmath87 . above",
    ", we have found that in two cases , homogeneous coverage from and convection - dominated rotation from , the mfpt scales inversely with @xmath87 .",
    "this scaling behavior is indeed found in the simulations , except that for very large values of @xmath87 , the mfpt approximates a constant value ( data not shown ) .",
    "the reason is that the larger @xmath87 , the smaller the mean time to fall below the height @xmath184 . as indicated by",
    ", then the sphere stays below this height until an encounter occurs .",
    "this implies that in this limit , the mfpt depends only on rotational motion and the falling motion is irrelevant",
    ".    we now introduce spatially resolved ligands into the 2d - model .",
    "a shows the model definition : the ligand patches are considered to have the same radius @xmath185 as the receptor patches and they are located at a distance @xmath186 from each other .",
    "this results in a one - dimensional ligand density given by @xmath187 .",
    "the mean first passage time will now also depend on the initial @xmath1-position , @xmath188 , where @xmath134 is the hypersurface in @xmath189 space where a receptor patch touches a ligand patch .",
    "but similarly as in the above section in regard to initial orientation , the dependence on the initial @xmath1-position is of minor interest and therefore , we will discuss the mfpt averaged over the initial position and orientation , denoted by @xmath190 .",
    "b shows that by varying the pclet number we can identify the same three regimes for all ligand - densities as before . for @xmath75 in the limit of pure diffusive transport",
    ", @xmath190 approaches a finite value , depending on @xmath191 and @xmath192 . with increasing @xmath79 , @xmath193 decreases monotonically and finally for @xmath194 reaches the value of the mfpt in the limit of homogeneous receptor and ligand coverage .",
    "in contrast to above , however , in this limit the shear flow not only restores rotational invariance of the sphere , but in addition also translational invariance of the substrate .",
    "a provides more details for @xmath190 as a function of @xmath192 in the diffusive limit ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "we find that in the range @xmath195 the mfpt is almost not affected by ligand concentration : as long as the ligand patches are sufficiently close to each other , a receptor patch touching the wall will most probably find a ligand before diffusing away again .",
    "the situation changes completely with small ligand density . for @xmath196",
    "the averaged mean first passage time @xmath190 scales with the ligand density @xmath192 as @xmath197 .",
    "this can be understood by calculating the position - averaged mfpt @xmath198 for a particle diffusing in an interval @xmath199 $ ] with diffusion constant @xmath200 , which gives @xmath201 .",
    "this suggests that the quadratic scaling with @xmath186 results from the diffusive motion between adjacent ligand patches .",
    "b summarizes our results for the dependence of the 2d mfpt @xmath190 on ligand density @xmath192 and receptor density @xmath191 in the diffusive limit .",
    "clearly there exists a large plateau around the value for the case of homogeneous coverage @xmath202 .",
    "this implies that if ligands and receptors patches are not too strongly diluted , the mean encounter time is still close to the optimal value given by . on the other hand",
    "if the number of receptor and/or ligand patches is highly reduced the mean encounter time is strongly increased .",
    "we finally turn to the full 3d - situation , that is the sphere may diffuse about all three axes as described by and .",
    "receptors are located in spherical patches which are randomly distributed over the sphere .",
    "each receptor patch has a radius @xmath158 and a height ( capture length ) @xmath5 .",
    "that is the appropriate generalization of the situation shown in for the 2d - case .",
    "thus , for @xmath130 receptor patches the receptor density is @xmath203 ( for @xmath204 ) .",
    "in contrast to the preceeding sections where the receptor patches could be regularly distributed over the circumference , this is no longer possible on the surface of a sphere .",
    "therefore , we distribute the patches randomly over the sphere with equal probability for each position , with a hard disk overlap algorithm making sure that no two patches overlap @xcite .",
    "one has to bear in mind that then for small @xmath130 two different distributions may have slightly different binding properties . this effect becomes weaker for larger @xmath130 , therefore in the following we will only use @xmath205 .",
    "the quantity we measure in our simulations is now @xmath206 in the case of homogeneous ligand coverage and @xmath207 in the case that the ligands are located in spherical patches on a 2d - lattice .",
    "thus , we average the mfpt over the initial orientations and positions as explained above .    in order to explore the dependence of @xmath206 on @xmath130 and @xmath79 we first simulated the receptor ligand encounter in the case of homogeneous ligand coverage @xmath208 . in order to average over the initial positions we started each run with a randomly chosen initial orientation .",
    "after 100 runs we generated a new distribution , thus averaging out also the effect of different receptor distributions . in order to achieve reasonable statistics , we typically used 100,000 runs .",
    "our results are shown in a. again we find three different regimes as a function of the pclet number @xmath79 .",
    "this proves that qualitatively the basic results of the 2d - treatment remain valid in 3d .",
    "however , in detail there are important differences .",
    "in contrast to the 2d results presented above , @xmath206 in the limit @xmath209 is no longer given by if @xmath130 is small . that is due to the fact that for @xmath76 the receptor patches effectively behave as ring - like structures .",
    "the rotation of such a ring about the @xmath1- or @xmath151-axis is not affected by @xmath79 and thus still depends on diffusion . for large @xmath130",
    "the rings cover the whole sphere and for @xmath76 @xmath206 is again given by .",
    "in b we plot the @xmath75 limit of @xmath206 as a function of the number of receptor patches @xmath130 , for different values of the capture radius @xmath5 . the fitted straight line for @xmath210 shows that @xmath206 approximately behaves like @xmath211 . neglecting effects of curvature ,",
    "the average distance between two receptors patches is @xmath212 and the mean time to diffuse that distance is @xmath213 .",
    "this provides a simple explanation for the observed scaling behavior . for high @xmath130 ,",
    "the mfpt reaches a plateau value , given by .",
    "this plateau value depends on @xmath5 and is the smaller the larger @xmath5 .",
    "also the crossover from the asymptotic behavior at small @xmath130 to the plateau at large @xmath130 is shifted with increasing capture radius @xmath5 towards smaller @xmath130 .    in c",
    "we show the effect of a finite ligand density @xmath192 at @xmath164 . for the simulations we distributed the ligands in circular patches of radius @xmath214 on a quadratic lattice with lattice constant @xmath186 , thus , resulting in a ligand density @xmath215 . in our implementation , the intersection between the receptor patch and the wall is approximated by an appropriate circle , because it is easy to check if this circle overlaps with the ligand patch .",
    "the fits given in c show that for small @xmath192 , the mfpt scales as @xmath216 . because the curves for different @xmath130 appear to be rather similar , in the inset we plot the ratio of different pairs of these curves . as this results in approximately constant plateaus ,",
    "we conclude that the scaling with ligand density is hardly effected by @xmath130 . as in 2d , the inverse scaling with ligand density can be understood in simple terms by noting that the mfpt to diffusional capture scales like @xmath217 . at a coverage around @xmath218 ,",
    "saturation occurs as it did for receptor coverage .",
    "we finally discuss the influence of the receptor geometry described by the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath158 . because @xmath79 changes the mfpt in a monotonous way , it is sufficient to study the diffusive limit @xmath219 .",
    "a and b show @xmath206 as a function of @xmath158 for @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively . in order to obtain smooth curves , in this case",
    "only one receptor distribution was used for all runs .",
    "we find that the curves can be fitted well to the function @xmath222 where the second term is the homogeneous result from .",
    "this means that even for vanishing receptor size @xmath223 the mfpt remains finite .",
    "this makes sense because above we have shown that the effective patch size is determined both by @xmath158 and @xmath5 . in detail , showed that capture occurs over the solid angle @xmath224 with @xmath225 . for small @xmath5 and @xmath158 ,",
    "this allows us to define an effective patch size @xmath226 where we have used @xmath227 .",
    "suppose now that the sphere diffuses over the time @xmath228 until a receptor patch points downwards , then it may encounter a ligand with a probability @xmath172 that is given by the normalized area of one effective receptor patch : @xmath229 if no encounter occurs , the sphere has to diffuse again a time @xmath228 until the next encounter can occur .",
    "this leads to the mean encounter time @xmath230 .",
    "putting everything together gives with @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "if checked against our simulation results , we indeed find that the fit parameter @xmath104 is an increasing function of @xmath5 , but varies only slightly with @xmath130 .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath233 scales approximately as @xmath183 and varies with @xmath5 , also consistent with the above analysis . in c @xmath206",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath158 for several values of @xmath5 and @xmath234 .",
    "one clearly sees that increasing @xmath158 has a much smaller impact on @xmath206 than a comparable increase in @xmath5 , which is qualitatively well described by the preceeding analysis .    in a and b the receptor density",
    "is varied over almost four orders of magnitude by changing @xmath158 , but the largest measured decrease for @xmath206 is only by a factor four .",
    "in contrast , an increase of the receptor density by one order of magnitude due to ten - fold more receptor patches leads to a decrease of @xmath206 by almost also one order of magnitude .",
    "however , this is only true as long as @xmath130 is not too large , as for large @xmath130 @xmath206 saturates at the limiting value of homogeneous receptor coverage ( cf .",
    "the crossover from the @xmath235 behavior to the saturation should take place when the average distance between two receptor patches @xmath236 becomes comparable to the size of one receptor patch .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath237 or @xmath238 .",
    "this estimate predicts that the crossover takes place between several tens to several hundreds of receptor - patches , depending on @xmath5 , in agreement with the data shown in b.",
    "in this paper we have calculated the mean first passage times ( mfpt ) for initial encounter between spatially resolved receptors on a brownian particle in linear shear flow and spatially resolved ligands on the boundary wall .",
    "our main results were obtained by repeated simulations of the discretized langevin equation .",
    "each data point shown corresponds to at least 100,000 simulation runs .",
    "it is important to note that these simulations are very time consuming because we resolve objects of the size of @xmath239 , that is for @xmath36m - sized particles we resolve the nm - scale .    in general",
    ", we found that the mfpt was always monotonically decreased when the pclet number was increased .",
    "that means that a particle which is covered with receptors in a way that it binds well to ligands already in the diffusive limit is even better suited to initiate binding at finite shear rate . in our simulations we modeled the receptor geometry using three parameters :",
    "the number of receptor - patches @xmath130 , the radius of the receptor patches @xmath158 , and the capture radius @xmath5",
    ". the efficiency of binding is mainly increased by @xmath130 , but only up to a saturation value of the order of hundred .",
    "an increase of @xmath158 leads only to a weak enhancement of binding efficiency .",
    "the influence of @xmath5 to the mfpt is threefold : i ) it reduces the mean falling time , ii ) it increases the effective patch size , and iii ) according to the stationary probability distribution for the @xmath2-direction , it becomes more probable for the sphere to be within the encounter zone when @xmath5 is increasing .",
    "an additional but more indirect effect of receptor protrusions is that the further the cell is away from the wall , the faster it can rotate ( even in the diffusive limit ) due to the larger mobility . as shown by rotations",
    "play a role only within binding range , i.e. , for @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , a large @xmath5 lets the cell also benefit from faster rotations . summarizing our findings in regard to receptor geometry",
    "we conclude that the most efficient design for particle capture under flow is to cover the particle with hundreds of receptor patches ( @xmath130 above threshold ) , each with a rather small area ( small @xmath158 ) , but formed as a protrusion ( large @xmath5 ) .",
    "indeed , this strategy seems to be used by white blood cells , which have evolved intriguing mechanisms both on the molecular and cellular scale in order to adhere effectively to the endothelium under the conditions of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "the typical size of white blood cells is @xmath240 m and they are covered with a few hundreds of protrusions ( _ microvilli _ ) with the receptors ( most notably l - selectin ) localized to the microvilli tips @xcite .",
    "in general , the microvilli of white blood cells are much more complex than the parameter @xmath5 in our model : they are rather long ( typical length 350 nm , that is @xmath241 ) and have their own physical properties ( e.g. , very flexible in the transverse direction and viscous in the longitudinal direction ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that elevation of the receptors above the main cell surface seems to be a major design principle for white blood cells .",
    "in fact , the same strategy appears to be used also by malaria - infected red blood cells , which are known to develop a dense coverage with elevated receptor patches ( _ knobs _ ) on the cell surface @xcite .",
    "a typical value for the cell radius is 3.5 @xmath36 m @xcite .",
    "the knobs have a typical height of 20 nm , a radius of about 90 nm and a distance of 200 nm ( for red blood cells infected by single parasites ) @xcite .",
    "this dense and elevated coverage suggests that like the white blood cells , the malaria - infected red blood cells also function in the regime of homogeneous coverage .    in order to discuss the motion of white blood cells in more detail , it is instructive to consider the parameters for a typical flow chamber experiment . in aqueous solution and at room temperature ,",
    "@xmath10 g/@xmath11 , @xmath12 pa s , and @xmath242 .",
    "then , the dimensionless parameters determining cell motion become @xmath243 where @xmath0 is given in @xmath244 , @xmath4 in units of g/@xmath11 and the shear rate @xmath245 in units of 1 per seconds ; @xmath58 is the diffusive time scale . for leukocytes in flow chambers we typically have @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 , thus , for the two pclet numbers we get @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively",
    "then , @xmath251 , that is the effect of hydrodynamic deterministic motion will be very strong .",
    "the experimental time scale is given by the time for transversing the field of view , which is about 3 s at a shear rate of 100 hz and length of 670 @xmath36 m .",
    "the diffusive time scale @xmath58 for leukocytes is about 600 s ( 10 min ) , which reflects their large size and shows that diffusive motion is by far not sufficient to initiate binding .",
    "binding becomes more favorable in the presence of convection . for a start height of one radius above the wall ( @xmath152 ) ,",
    "our calculations give a mfpt of about 5 s , that is much less than the diffusive time .",
    "however , this is still much larger than the experimental time scale .",
    "this proves that only those cells have a chance to bind that flow very close to the wall , exactly as observed experimentally . in vivo",
    ", white blood cells therefore depend also on other mechanisms driving them onto the substrate , including contact and hydrodynamic interactions with other cells .",
    "these effects have been studied in detail before .",
    "for example , munn and coworkers have shown that adhesion of leukocytes close the the vessel wall in post - capillary venules is enhanced by red blood cells passing them @xcite .",
    "king and hammer have shown , using an algorithm capable of simulating several cells , that already adherent leukocytes can recruit other leukocytes via hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "the results presented here , when specified to leukocytes , show that indeed these mechanisms are crucial for effective leukocyte capture under flow .",
    "our results also suggest that leukocytes are sufficiently large that thermal fluctuations are not dominant .",
    "this changes when studying smaller particles , e.g. , receptor - covered spheres with @xmath252 m , whose binding also has been investigated with flow chambers @xcite .",
    "shows that the pclet numbers scale strongly with particle radius @xmath0 , therefore , these beads are subject to much stronger thermal fluctuations than leukocytes . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been verified that indeed in equilibrium such particles obey the barometric distribution from . in ref .  @xcite it was found that the adhesion probability @xmath253 is proportional to the ligand - density , @xmath254 . with @xmath255",
    "it follows that @xmath256 as found by our simulations in the limit of low ligand densities .    throughout this paper",
    "we have considered the generic case of a constant downward acting force due to a density difference between the sphere and the surrounding fluid . in future work",
    "it might be interesting to examine also other forces which can easily be done in the framework presented here .",
    "as the addition formula for falling and rotational mfpt was not derived under the assumption of a specific force , it is also true for non - constant forces . for general potential forces",
    "the falling time has then to be replaced by .",
    "also the rotational mfpt is influenced by a vertical force via the stationary height distribution .",
    "neglecting gravitational force and considering only short - ranged forces like van der waals or electrostatic forces would result in infinite mfpts for the setup of the halfspace .",
    "this problem , however , can be solved by using an additional wall acting as an upper boundary @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assumed a rigid brownian particle . for cells",
    ", elastic deformations might be relevant .",
    "for free flow , a simple scaling estimate shows that the critical value for the shear rate leading to substantial deviations from the spherical shape is @xmath257 @xcite , where @xmath258 pa and @xmath259 nm are young modulus and thickness of the cellular envelope , respectively .",
    "the fact that the young modulus e appears here indicates that cells tend to passively deform less than vesicles , whose elasticity is characterized rather by the bending rigidity @xcite .",
    "the scaling estimate leads to a critical shear rate of @xmath260 hz , which is above the value of a few @xmath261 hz ( corresponding to @xmath262 for white blood cells ) which often provides an upper limit in flow chamber experiments .",
    "similar but more complicated scaling arguments can be made for lubrication forces which arise when the cell approaches the wall @xcite .    to fully understand the rate of association between a receptor - covered particle in shear flow and a ligand - covered wall , our analysis",
    "should be completed by the implementation of an adhesion scenario , which in general should also include molecular determinants like residence times and receptor flexibility .",
    "if one assumes that a bond between two encountering molecules is formed with a certain rate , then , the mfpt for encounter as reported here should be a good approximation for the mean adhesion time in the limit of zero shear rate , because in this limit the duration of each encounter should be sufficiently long for the formation of an adhesion contact .",
    "then , the proper knowledge of the mfpt could also be used to design a cell sorting experiment .",
    "suppose one has a mixture of different cells each bearing some receptors and the wall is covered with one kind of ligand .",
    "then , the cells are flowed into the chamber and flow is stopped .",
    "certainly , only cells that bear receptors which fit to the ligands can attach to the wall .",
    "if the flow is then turned on again , the attached cells will be separated from the other cells .",
    "if the no - flow period is much shorter than the mfpt , only a few cells can attach .",
    "if the no - flow period is much longer than the mfpt , attached cells might already start to spread and are therefore difficult to remove .",
    "only if the no - flow period is of the order of mfpt one gets an appreciable number of weakly attached cells . in this sense",
    "our theoretical analysis might be essential for appropriate biotechnological applications .",

    "in order to solve numerically we use an euler algorithm . as the physical situation requires to use the stratonovich interpretation of the noise term @xmath301 , the displacement @xmath326 of a particle from time @xmath41 to time @xmath327 depends on the position of the particle at time @xmath328 , which is not known at time @xmath41 . as usual",
    ", this problem is solved by rewriting the langevin equation in the it - version .",
    "then the noise term can be evaluated at time @xmath41 and as a compensation an additional drift term @xmath329 is added to @xcite . because @xmath330 , we arrive at . in this equation , the random displacements @xmath331 must satisfy @xmath332 following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath333 is calculated from a weighted sum of normal deviate random numbers @xmath334 satisfying @xmath335 .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath338 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the euler method , instead of normal deviate random variables any uncorrelated random variable @xmath339 can be chosen , as long as they fulfill the required relation for the first moments @xmath340 .",
    "thus , it is much faster to generate the random numbers according to @xmath341 , with @xmath342 being uncorrelated random variables uniformly distributed in @xmath42 $ ] . for the calculation of the random numbers we use the pseudo random number generator ran3 from the numerical recipes @xcite .    calculating the new configuration after each time - step using ( [ langevin - euler ] ) is straightforward for the spatial degrees of freedom . for the update of the orientation of the sphere we use a coordinate system spanned by three orthonormal basis - vectors @xmath343 .",
    "the origin of this coordinate system shall be identical with the center of mass of the sphere and the relative orientation of this system and of the sphere are kept fixed .",

    "[ sec:2d ] and [ sec:3d ] typically @xmath355 iterations where chosen resulting in statistical errors in the range of @xmath356 .",
    "error - bars in these sections refer to the statistical error .    the systematic error for the mean first passage time calculated by use of an euler algorithm scales with @xmath357 , although the error of the particle position is only of the order of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "thus to decrease the systematic error by a factor of 10 one must increase the numerical cost by a factor of 100 .",
    "one way to obtain accurate results at moderate numerical cost is to measure the mean first passage time for various intermediate numerical time steps .",
