    "the recent advance in modern cosmology due to new and improved telescopes and techniques seems to overthrow the long - lasting paradigm or hope of an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe . from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "@xcite , along with studies of large scale structure ( lss ) , @xcite and the lyman @xmath1 forest @xcite ( ly@xmath1 ) etc .",
    "it is inferred that the universe consists of roughly 30 % matter ( cold dark matter , cdm and ordinary matter ) and 70 % dark energy .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the apparent magnitude of type ia supernovae ( sne ) have been used by two collaborations @xcite to estimate the values of the total matter energy density @xmath2 , which includes cdm , and the density in dark energy , e.g.  @xmath3 .",
    "type ia sne are believed to be so - called standard candles , i.e.  they show a very small scatter in intrinsic luminosity after empirical corrections @xcite , and by measuring the apparent magnitudes , the cosmology - dependent luminosity distance can be inferred .",
    "the supernovae look fainter than they would in an eds universe favouring both a non - zero @xmath3 and @xmath4 . combined with cmb data from boomerang and maxima @xcite",
    ", they end up at approximately the same values as the above - mentioned cmb , lss and ly@xmath1 measurements .",
    "however , there is a number of potential systematic errors that can contaminate the measurements .",
    "first , inter- and/or intra - galactic dust may obscure the light from the sne and make them look fainter .",
    "this has been investigated in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is also still unclear whether there is any evolution of the sn brightness with redshift .",
    "many potential sources of evolution have been proposed , such as differing progenitor composition @xcite or host galaxy morphology ( and thereby redshift ) dependence @xcite just to name a few .",
    "furthermore , if photons can oscillate into axions , the sne will also look fainter due to the reduced number of received photons .",
    "this has been addressed e.g.  in reference @xcite .",
    "a fourth possible contaminant is magnification or de - magnification by gravitational lensing . having a large sample of sne",
    "this can be corrected for statistically @xcite , but when studying single sne , the lensing effects need a careful treatment .",
    "this was the case with the farthest known sn so far , sn1997ff , at a redshift of 1.7 .",
    "the vicinity of the line - of - sight to this sn was unusually dense in galaxies and modelling of the individual lens galaxies was required .",
    "this was done by @xcite who conclude a large possible magnification depending on the lens masses and concentrations .",
    "bentez et al .",
    "@xcite conclude a magnification of 0.34@xmath50.12 mag .",
    "in this paper we present the well - known multiple lens - plane method applied to the calculation of the magnification of any point- or extended source .",
    "section [ sec : lensing ] describes this method in a general way .",
    "furthermore , we model the lenses as spherically symmetric navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) or singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) halos and the lensing properties of these are described in sections [ subs : nfw ] and [ subs : sis ] . for more information on",
    "under which circumstances each halo type is appropriate , see e.g.  reference @xcite . the method and models",
    "are manifested in a ` fortran 77 ` program , q - let , obtainable from the author upon request or it can be downloaded at ` http://www.physto.se/~cg/qlet/qlet.htm ` .",
    "the program is described in the text in section [ sec : program ] . in reference",
    "@xcite , an early version of q - let was used to estimate the magnification of the abovementioned sn1997ff .",
    "section [ sec : ramone ] describes the application of the code to the recently discovered supernova sn2003es .",
    "this section introduces the multiple lens - plane method and gives the important equations needed in the study of multiple light deflection . for more details , see reference @xcite .",
    "we also describe the lensing properties of the nfw and sis halo profiles .",
    "we start by projecting the mass of each massive object ( e.g.  galaxy ) onto a plane at the respective object redshift . in the @xmath6:th plane",
    ", this gives a surface mass density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the impact parameter of the light - ray in each plane ( see figure [ fig : mullens ] ) .",
    "the justification for this projection is that the light is deflected only in the very vicinity of the lens in most cases and then travels practically unimpeded until it reaches the observer or another lens , situated far away from the preceding one .      from figure",
    "[ fig : mullens ] , where most quantities are defined , we see that the position of the light - ray in each plane can be obtained recursively from the observed position @xmath9 through @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular diameter distance between redshifts @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . with @xmath16 lens - planes",
    "we find the source position as @xmath17 . for convenience",
    "we use , in each plane , dimensionless quantities defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary scale length in the @xmath6:th plane which , if chosen as @xmath20 , makes @xmath21 the angular impact parameter in each plane .",
    "furthermore , the _ convergence _ is @xmath22 where ( in geometrised units ) @xmath23 is called the _",
    "critical density _ due to its relation to the ability of a lens to produce multiple images .",
    "if we also define @xmath24 , the _ scaled deflection potential _ @xmath25 , needed for the magnification and defined through @xmath26 becomes @xmath27 in these units where @xmath28 is the source position , the lens equation is given by @xmath29      we now want to find the magnification as a function of image position .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the jacobian matrix of the lens equation @xmath31 furthermore we need @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this gives @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the 2@xmath412 unit matrix .",
    "the @xmath42:s can be found by recursion and by noting that @xmath43 ; @xmath44 finally , the magnification is given by @xmath45 negative values of @xmath46 indicates images of reversed parity relative to the unlensed image .      the use of the navarro - frenk - white model calls for a brief description of its lensing properties .    before projection onto the lens plane ,",
    "the nfw profile is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are scale parameters that can be determined once e.g.  the mass is specified , @xmath50 is the radial co - ordinate",
    ". the projected surface mass density will be circularly symmetric and we no longer need vector notation on the impact parameter but instead choose @xmath51 as the radial co - ordinate with the origin at the lens centre . if we choose @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dimless1 ] ) ) and define @xmath53 , then @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the deflection angle is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the magnification will be given by @xmath59^{-1}.   \\label{eq : mag5}\\ ] ] a flaw of this model is that the total mass diverges when integrated out to infinity .",
    "however , this is not too serious since the deflection angle only is sensitive to the mass inside the impact radius , and the magnification is sensitive to this mass and the convergence at this point ( for circularly symmetric lenses ) .",
    "thus all mass outside the impact radius is unimportant .",
    "a single nfw halo gives either one or three images , where the primary image has @xmath60 , the secondary @xmath61 and the tertiary @xmath62 .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere model , also used here , is based on the assumption that the dark matter in the halo behaves as particles in an ideal gas trapped in their gravitational potential .",
    "the gas is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium and the resulting density profile before projection ( in geometrised units ) is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the particles .",
    "if we choose @xmath65 the equations for convergence , deflection angle , intrinsic source position and magnification become very simple for this model : @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 as with the nfw model , the sis will give an infinite mass when integrated to infinity but the argument above regarding deflection angle and magnification also holds here .",
    "when considering a single sis halo it can give either one or two images depending on the impact parameter .",
    "primary images have @xmath60 and secondary have @xmath61 .",
    "the quick lensing estimation tool , q - let is a ` fortran 77 ` code written in order to quickly be able to estimate the lensing effects on a point source or an extended object .",
    "the structure of the code is as follows    * read the input datafile and sort the planes * check if parameter values are allowed * present a choice between a point- or an extended source with elliptical image shape , alternatively a square grid ( see section [ subs : output ] ) * compute magnifications and positions of light rays * present a choice of how to output the results    a used supplied datafile contains the cosmological parameters , the source redshift and position and the lenses redshifts , positions , velocity dispersions _ or _ masses and finally their halo type .",
    "the mass should be @xmath70 , i.e.  the mass within the radius ( @xmath71 ) within which the average energy density is 200 times the critical density at the lens redshift .",
    "a point source must be put at the origin . for the case of an elliptical image",
    ", the origin will be put at the source centre and the ellipse will be centered at user specified co - ordinates which should be taken as ( 0,0 ) if an elliptical image only is studied .",
    "the possibility of putting the ellipse off - origin is useful to study e.g.  a sn that is offset from its host galaxy centre and the galaxy shape is to be investigated .",
    "the sn is put at the origin and the host galaxy central co - ordinates are given as input . if a square grid ( see section [ subs : output ] ) is used , it will be centered at @xmath72 .",
    "the angular positions of the lensing galaxies should of course be assigned with respect to this origin and should be given in arcseconds .",
    "the velocity dispersions and masses should be given in @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "see section [ subs : input ] for an example of an input file .",
    "if only @xmath70 is given for a sis lens , this mass will be used to calculate the corresponding velocity dispersion since @xmath75 is the parameter used to determine the lensing strength for this halo type . if , on the other hand , only @xmath75 is given for a nfw lens , this velocity dispersion will be used to calculate the corresponding @xmath70 for a * sis * lens and assuming @xmath76 is the same for the nfw halo for a discussion of the validity of this . ] .",
    "this is done since the lensing properties of the nfw halo depends upon @xmath70 in our calculations .",
    "if , for some reason , both the mass and velocity dispersion are given , the mass ( velocity dispersion ) will be ignored for the sis ( nfw ) lens .",
    "all distances are computed using the filled beam approximation and it is also with respect to an homogeneous universe that the magnification is given .      due to computational complications ( and perhaps lack of connection to reality ) there are some approximate restrictions on the input parameters . however , these restrictions do not severely limit the usefulness of the code as can be seen in table [ tab : restr ] where the allowed parameter ranges are presented . furthermore , some of them are not very strict and depends on the values of the other parameters making these ranges approximate only . especially extremely low or high hubble parameters ( @xmath77 or @xmath78 might lead to problems .",

    "if instead wishing to see e.g.  what an intrinsically elliptical source looks like in the image plane , you make the cut using the 4:th and 5:th columns , even though the grid in the source plane is not evenly distributed it will be possible as long as it covers the area where the cut is made .",

    "as the host galaxy seems to be an elliptical , it is most likely a type ia sn @xcite .",

    "this is done in order to see that the observed elliptical shape is not contrived from an intrinsically very complicated shape that is never observed in reality .",
    "the normalisation of the velocity dispersion is quite poorly known @xcite and we choose to present the magnification as a function of this normalisation . for the host galaxy shape calculation we used a value of @xmath109 km / s , obtained as an average in reference @xcite for a mixture of galaxy morphologies .",
    "however , the shape is not distorted very much even with @xmath99 as high as 300 km / s , although it is translated and more strongly magnified .",
    "the result on the magnification is found in figure [ fig : rammag ] .",
    "we have used models where all halos are assumed to be either of nfw or sis type .",
    "the figure also shows the result both when including the four gh galaxies and when excluding them .",
    "as is seen , in the region of @xmath99 between 150 and 200 km / s , i.e.  around 170 km / s , the magnification varies between roughly 1.08 and 1.27 depending on the the model and the presence of the gh galaxies .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude shift of @xmath110 mag , a significant change that could dominate the uncertainty ( the intrinsic magnitude spread in type ia sne is roughly between 0.1 and 0.2 mag @xcite ) .",
    "note also that higher @xmath99 have been obtained e.g.  in reference @xcite , where a value for the sis of roughly 275 km / s was obtained for the dark matter in ellipticals .    in figure",
    "[ fig : move ] , we display the intrinsic ( unlensed ) position relative to the observed position at ( 0,0 ) , depending on @xmath99 and the model ( nfw / sis and gh incl./gh excl . ) .",
    "we see that the shift is only weakly depending on the halo type for this lens system under our assumptions .",
    "finally , we show the intrinsic shape of the host galaxy for a @xmath99 of 170 km",
    "/ s @xcite in figure [ fig : ramell ] .",
    "this plot _ also _ shows the small difference in deflection between nfw and sis halo models under our assumptions .",
    "the shapes were computed including the gh galaxies .",
    "the axis ratios of both the nfw and sis case are roughly 0.9 , making them perfectly normal e1 galaxies so no constraints on the magnification or model can be inferred from the host galaxy shape .",
    "one of the approximations that may be criticised is the fact that we extend the halos out to infinity .",
    "however , the lensing effect at large impact radii is very small . for sn2003es ,",
    "the lenses with large impact radii contribute very little to the total magnification which is dominated by galaxies no .",
    "631 and 662 .",
    "putting @xmath70 of the nfw equal to that of the sis for a given velocity dispersion is not obviously a good approximation .",
    "the most likely measured quantities are the luminosity or velocity dispersion of the lens and the luminosity may be used to estimate a velocity dispersion either via the tully - fisher or faber - jackson relation .",
    "when a velocity dispersion is obtained , the best way would be to use it directly on the nfw profile .",
    "however , as opposed to the sis , the nfw velocity dispersion depends on the radius . by following okas and mamon in reference",
    "@xcite it is possible to obtain the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath111 , for well resolved sources , or , for small or distant sources , the `` aperture velocity dispersion '' , @xmath112 , which is the average over an aperture centered on the object .",
    "we calculated both these quantities as a function of radius and found that @xmath112 did not fall off dramatically .",
    "as an example , in a case where we put the sis velocity dispersion ( @xmath113 ) to 170 km / s to get the parameters for the nfw and then compute the corresponding nfw velocity dispersions , @xmath112 varies roughly by @xmath114% and @xmath115% around 170 km / s between radii @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion varies more , @xmath118% to @xmath119% in the same range .",
    "however , at a radius of _ roughly _",
    "@xmath120 , there is a quite small scatter around the sis value of less than @xmath12115% .",
    "this seems to be valid for a large range of redshifts and velocity dispersions .",
    "it also seems valid in low @xmath122- and low density universes .",
    "thus in almost all cases it is possible to find a radius at which @xmath123 , with this radius being roughly equal to @xmath120 .",
    "inverting the velocity dispersion - mass relation for the nfw is quite time - consuming , and this , along with the ambiguity due to the dependence of @xmath75 on radius and the fact that the difference seems not to be significant , motivates using the simpler conversion via the sis .",
    "however , if this conversion is unsatisfactory , it is always possible for the user to supply @xmath70 instead , in which case of course no conversion is needed .    for the irregular galaxies we have used the faber - jackson relation which is valid for ellipticals .",
    "an approximation which is difficult to say to what extent it affects the results , and in which direction . using",
    "the tully - fisher relation on the irregulars would increase the magnification even further , but at most by @xmath12115 - 20% .",
    "whether the halo models we use are good descriptions of real halos is still under debate .",
    "we are using spherically symmetric models , which might be an oversimplification but the ellipticity of the dark matter in the observed halos is in practice very seldom known ( see e.g.  reference @xcite for the effects of ellipticity in lensing ) .",
    "so , unless some new model is very different from the sis and nfw , the results for sn2003es is likely to remain .",
    "we have found that sn2003es is likely to have been significantly magnified by gravitational lensing , a fact that must be taken into account when trying to use this ( likely type ia ) sn to infer cosmological parameters .",
    "either a more thorough analysis of the lensing galaxies is needed to take the effect into account or the sn should be used only to set a lower limit on the distance or maybe even be excluded from the sample if not having large statistics . in that case some sne are likely to be de - magnified and the effect can be assumed to average to @xmath124 . the fact that the intrinsic shape of the host galaxy looks perfectly normal makes it practically impossible to use this shape to put constraints on the magnification of sn2003es .",
    "if an extremely unusual shape would have been obtained , it could perhaps have affected the reliability of the model .",
    "we have presented the multiple lens - plane method of gravitational lensing along with its implementation in q - let , a ` fortran 77 ` code that can be used to quickly estimate the lensing effects on either a point source or to obtain the intrinsic shape of an elliptical image .",
    "a square grid in the image plane is also possible for user - defined image shapes .",
    "the code was applied to sn2003es , a sn ( most likely type ia ) discovered in the hdf - n . using both nfw and sis type halos and estimating the velocity dispersions from the observed luminosities via the faber - jackson and tully - fisher relations we found that sn2003es is likely to have been significantly magnified by gravitational lensing and that this problem should be addressed in detail before using sn2003es in estimates of the cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> q - let is a fortran 77 code that enables a quick estimate of the gravitational lensing effects on a point- or an extended source . </S>",
    "<S> the user provided input consists of the redshifts , angular positions relative to the source , mass or velocity dispersion estimate and halo type for the lens galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the considered halo types are the navarro - frenk - white and the singular isothermal sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the code uses the so - called multiple lens - plane method to find the magnification and intrinsic shape of the source . </S>",
    "<S> this method takes into account the multiple deflections that may arise when several mass accumulations are situated at different redshifts close to the line - of - sight .    </S>",
    "<S> the q - let code is applied to the recently discovered supernova , sn2003es , which is likely to be of type ia as its host galaxy is classified as an elliptical . </S>",
    "<S> we find that sn2003es is likely to have been significantly magnified by gravitational lensing and that this should be considered in high-@xmath0 studies if this sn is to be used to determine the cosmological parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> q - let was motivated by the supernova searches , where lensing can be a problem , but it can also be applied to any simple lens system where a quick estimate is wanted , e.g.  the single lens case . </S>"
