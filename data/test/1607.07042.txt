    "muons have been undispensible probes in fundamental ( and applied ) physics for a long time .",
    "their completely unexpected discovery is ascribed to anderson and neddermeyer.@xcite muons have already been seen earlier by kunze@xcite albeit without claiming detection of a new particle .",
    "actually muons were until the 1940s mostly considered to be the predicted and searched for pions . in 1960 muonium ( mu ) , the hydrogen - like bound state of a positive muon and an electron ( @xmath2e@xmath3 ) , was unambiguously detected by hughes and coworkers.@xcite muons and mu continue to play a role of utmost importance in precision tests of the standard model of particle physics as well as in the search for new physics beyond it .",
    "they can be produced in comparatively large quantities , they live long enough for many applications and they decay sufficiently fast in a parity violating , self polarization - analyzing weak process ( @xmath4 ) which makes them most versatile .",
    "actually , the discovery of parity violation ( pv ) in nuclear @xmath5 decay@xcite was instantaneously followed by the demonstration of pv in muon decay.@xcite later it has been shown that the v - a structure of the standard model weak interaction follows already solely from muon decay experiments , including inverse muon decay.@xcite the reader will find an excellent review on fundamental muon physics@xcite and many references concerning the important role of low momentum muons , pions and neutrons in precision physics in ref .  .",
    "below , a brief status update on muon activities at psi is presented without explicitly connecting to the standard - model extension ( sme ) and its coefficients.@xcite however , given the fact that all precision experiments acquire time stamped data sets , a wealth of opportunities exists for corresponding analyses .",
    "psi s hipa complex with its unique beam power provides the largest intensities of low momentum pions , muons and ultracold neutrons to fundamental physics experiments .",
    "the arrangement of the pion production targets as part of the beam optics of the proton beam onto the continuous spallation neutron source sinq at psi guarantees a highly efficient pion and muon production .",
    "the full proton beam intensity can be used while about 70% of the beam continues with only a small energy loss to the spallation target of sinq .",
    "most of the recent particle physics experiments used low momentum beams of both polarities ( @xmath2 , @xmath6 ) for measurements with stopped muons in low mass targets .",
    "prime examples of such efforts yielded ( i ) the new limit of @xmath7 ( 90% c.l . ) for the charged lepton flavor violating decay @xmath8 by the meg collaboration,@xcite using @xmath9/s @xmath2 of about 28mev / c ( 4mev kinetic energy ) stopping after some degrader in an about 200@xmath10 m thick polyethylene target and ( ii ) the measurements of 2s-2p lamb shift transitions in muonic hydrogen and deuterium by the crema collaboration,@xcite stopping about 600/s @xmath6 of only 3kev kinetic energy in a 20 cm long target filled with about 1hpa of h@xmath11 or d@xmath11 , respectively , and determining the nuclear rms charge radii of both proton and deuteron to about @xmath12 precision .",
    "these two experiments were conducted at hipa s @xmath13e5 beamline ( see the beamline overview map@xcite ) which presently is the world s highest intensity low momentum muon beam for particle physics .",
    "even slightly higher intensities are obtained at the @xmath10e4 beam@xcite which is usually dedicated to condensed matter studies with muon spin rotation ( @xmath10sr ) but has recently also been applied to study mu production into vacuum.@xcite a very successful series of experiments was conducted by the mulan,@xcite mucap,@xcite and musun@xcite collaborations , initially in the @xmath13e3 and later in the @xmath13e1 beam areas.@xcite the 1ppm measurement of the positive muon lifetime by mulan resulted in a 0.5ppm determination of the fermi coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "mucap measured the @xmath6 lifetime in a high - purity protium target and determined the singlet capture rate to 1% and by that the weak pseudoscalar coupling @xmath15 of the proton to 7% .",
    "musun is under way to determine the muon capture rate on deuterons by the same technique .",
    "various new muon experiments are under way and progress has recently been reported at psi s annual particle physics users meeting.@xcite the meg ii experiment aims at a sensitivity to @xmath8 of @xmath16 . the mu3e collaboration pursues a search for the charged lepton flavor violating decay @xmath17 in two phases , first aiming at @xmath18 and later @xmath19 at the new himb .",
    "studies for himb already benefit conventional meson target designs.@xcite himb will provide @xmath20/s below 30mev / c to the phase-2 mu3e experiment . the beamline will open up new possibilites for statistically limited muon experiments in general . the muse collaboration will compare muon and electron scattering on hydrogen at the @xmath13m1 beamline@xcite and decisively test the difference in rms charge radii obtained so far by electron scattering and ordinary hydrogen spectroscopy versus the muonic atom result.@xcite the crema collaboration has meanwhile finished data taking on the 2s-2p lamb shift transitions in @xmath21he and is now turning to the laser spectroscopy of the ground state hyperfine splitting in h and @xmath22he .",
    "also spectroscopy of heavy muonic atoms is regaining interest , e.g. , the mux collaboration is setting out to measure the charge radii of @xmath23ra and other heavy , radioactive isotopes .",
    "a lot of progress is also being made by the mucool collaboration with the development of a very high brightness beam of slow @xmath2.@xcite together with ref .",
    "this development will allow for an improved measurement of the mu 1s-2s transition@xcite and pave the way for a test of the free fall of mu,@xcite the mass of which is dominated by the antimatter , second generation lepton .",
    "illuminating discussions with colleagues , especially at cpt16 , and continued support of psi s accelerator and beam line groups and psi / eth technical services , the swiss national science foundation ( 200020_159754 ) and the eth zrich ( eth-35 14 - 1 ) are gratefully acknowledged ."
