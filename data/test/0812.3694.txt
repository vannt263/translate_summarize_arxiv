    "quantum information protocols have been demonstrated experimentally in both the discrete - variable ( dv ) and so - called continuous - variable ( cv ) settings .",

    "cv quantum information is experimentally appealing because sophisticated squeezed light experiments have led to claims of successful quantum information protocols such as teleportation  @xcite , key distribution  @xcite , and memory  @xcite , but the theoretical status of cv quantum information is challenged by unresolved issues concerning quantum error correction  @xcite , non - distillability  @xcite , no - go theorems for quantum computation  @xcite , and the absence of full security proofs for key distribution .",
    "cv information processing has also been studied for classical models , including the now named blum - shub - smale machine @xcite and continuous turing machines @xcite .",
    "these models are of background relevance to the research into cv quantum information and are referenced here for contextual purposes .    in this paper , we establish a sound theoretical framework for studying quantum algorithms and apply this framework to study the cv analogue of the early dv quantum algorithm , known as the deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) algorithm  @xcite . the problem solved by dj algorithm is the following .",

    "the best classical algorithm requires @xmath2 evaluations in the worst case .",

    "if the function is accessible on a quantum computer as a quantum oracle , then the dj algorithm is exact and requires just one evaluation to solve the problem .",
    "our focus here is on the cv analogue of the dj algorithm , and we are inspired by the braunstein and pati formulation  @xcite of the cv dj algorithm ; however , our work differs from theirs in that ours relies only on logical states that are elements in the hilbert space and thus provides a strict cv version of the dj problem .",
    "we introduce a particular model for the computation of the dj problem in a cv setting . within the constraints of this model",
    ", our analysis shows that the cv dj algorithm is necessarily probabilistic and its performance must therefore be compared to the classical case where bounded error is tolerated and not to the classical deterministic case .",
    "we choose the dj algorithm for the following reasons .",
    "two types of quantum algorithms dominate the field , those that implement a version of the hidden subgroup problem and those that use a version of grover s search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "an early example of the former is the deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) algorithm  @xcite , which is amongst the oracle class of problems  @xcite that have been important in demonstrations of quantum speed - ups . finally the cv dj algorithm has a head start in the work of braunstein and pati so our analysis can build on their concepts  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : background ] , we review the dj algorithm . although this algorithm is well known , our review serves as a foundation for careful construction of the cv version of this algorithm .",
    "furthermore we compare the dj algorithm s performance against both deterministic and probabilistic strategies , especially because the cv case can only be properly compared against probabilistic strategies because the cv dj algorithm can never be deterministic .",
    "our description of the dv dj algorithm comprises three steps so that these steps can be discussed separately during the construction of the cv analogue .",

    "overcoming this challenge enables us to recognize that perfect encoding results in the inability to determine if the encoding is of a constant string or balanced in a single execution of the algorithm .",
    "we show that this probabilistic nature of the algorithm is the result of an uncertainty relation between the continuous representation and its fourier - transform dual representation .    in sec .",

    "a deterministic algorithm corresponds to submitting queries in the form of @xmath7-bit inputs and obtain the one - bit output for each query .",
    "there are  @xmath6 unique input strings , but the promise of balanced versus constant functions implies that only @xmath30 are required to determine whether the given function is balanced or constant , with certainty .",
    "the reason that fewer than @xmath30 queries is insufficient is that only @xmath31 queries may reveal all output bits being the same , suggesting a constant function , whereas the remaining @xmath31 outputs could all be the opposite of the first @xmath31 queries .      in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : deterministic ] , we saw that fewer than @xmath30 queries is insufficient for a deterministic algorithm , but that case seems highly unlikely .",
    "more formally , fewer than @xmath30 queries will identify most of the balanced functions as non - constant in much fewer than @xmath30 queries .",
    "here we ask the question about how many queries are required if we are prepared to tolerate a small number of errors .",
    "in fact a probabilistic algorithm achieves an exponentially small error of @xmath4 with a number of queries that is only linear in  @xmath5  @xcite . to understand how a probabilistic algorithm can help ,",
    "consider that , although a single query with a random input provides no information , two queries with two random inputs can be highly informative .",
    "if the output from the second query differs from the first output , then the function is proved not to be constant and therefore must be balanced .",
    "if , on the other hand , the second output is the same as the first , then the outcome is not certain , but the more times the outputs are the same , the more confident one can be about the function being constant .",

    "we thus conclude that the construction employing both control and target qubits is not strictly necessary .",

    "<S> we establish a framework for oracle identification problems in the continuous variable setting , where the stated problem necessarily is the same as in the discrete variable case , and continuous variables are manifested through a continuous representation in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this formalism to the deutsch - jozsa problem and show that , due to an uncertainty relation between the continuous representation and its fourier - transform dual representation , the corresponding deutsch - jozsa algorithm is probabilistic hence forbids an exponential speed - up , contrary to a previous claim in the literature .    </S>",
