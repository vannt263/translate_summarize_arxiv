    "the notion of graph - like legendrian unfoldings was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it belongs to a special class of the big legendrian submanifolds which zakalyukin introduced in @xcite .",
    "there have been some developments on this theory during past two decades@xcite .",
    "most of the results here are already present , implicitly or explicitly , in those articles . however , we give in this survey detailed proofs as an aid to understanding and applying the theory .",
    "moreover some of the results here are original , especially theorem 4.14 which explains how the theory of graph - like legendrian unfoldings is useful for applying to many situations related to the theory of lagrangian singularities ( caustics ) .",
    "moreover , it has been known that caustics equivalence ( i.e. , diffeomorphic caustics ) does not imply lagrangian equivalence .",
    "this is one of the main differences from the theory of legendrian singularities . in the theory of legendrian singularities ,",
    "wave fronts equivalence ( i.e. , diffeomorphic wave fronts ) implies legendrian equivalence generically .",
    "one of the typical examples of big wave fronts ( also , graph - like wave fronts ) is given by the parallels of a plane curve .",
    "for a curve in the euclidean plane , its parallels consist of those curves a fixed distance @xmath0 down the normals in a fixed direction .",
    "they usually have singularities for sufficiently large @xmath1 their singularities are always legendrian singularities .",
    "it is well - known that the singularities of the parallels lie on the evolute of the curve .",
    "we draw the picture of the parallels of an ellipse and the locus of those singularities in fig.1 .",
    "moreover , there is another interpretation of the evolute of a curve . if we consider the family of normal lines to the curve , the evolute is the envelope of this family of normal lines .",
    "we also draw the envelope of the family of normal lines to an ellipse in fig.2 .",
    "the picture of the corresponding big wave front is depicted in fig.3 .",
    "the evolute is one of the examples of caustics and the family of parallels is a wave front propagation .",
    "we can observe that the graph is a smooth surface in @xmath2 but it is multi - valued .",
    "moreover , each @xmath3 is non - singular but @xmath4 has singularities .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is a big wave front but not a graph - like wave front .      in this subsection",
    "we respectively interpret the focal set ( i.e. , the evolute ) of a hypersurface as the caustic and the parallels of a hypersurface as the graph - like momentary fronts by using the distance squared functions ( cf .",

    "we now define families of functions in order to describe the focal set and the parallels of a hypersurface in @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath26 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath29 , where we denote that @xmath30 is the set of positive real numbers .",
    "we call @xmath31 a _ distance squared function _ and @xmath32 an _ extended distance squared function _ on @xmath9 .",
    "denote that the function @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .                as a consequence of proposition 5.6 , we have the following : @xmath49 @xmath50 we can naturally interpret the focal set of a hypersurface as a caustic .",
    "moreover , the parallels of a hypersurface are given as a graph - like wave front ( the momentary fronts ) .",
    "for a hypersurface @xmath6 , the distance squared function @xmath51 is a morse family of functions and the extended distance squared function @xmath52 is a non - degenerate graph - like morse family of hypersurfaces .      by proposition 4.5 ,",
    "it is enough to show that @xmath31 is a morse family of hypersurfaces . for any @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 , where @xmath55",
    ". we shall prove that the mapping @xmath56 is a non - singular at any point .",
    "the jacobian matrix of @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the inner product of @xmath25 .",

    " 2 ) , we can define a lagrangian submanifold germ whose generating family is the distance squared function @xmath31 of @xmath9 as follows : for a hypersurface @xmath6 where @xmath55 , we define @xmath69 by @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    on the other hand , by the method for constructing the graph - like legendrian unfolding from a graph - like morse family of hypersurfaces ( cf .",

    "we now briefly describe the theory of contact with foliations .",
    "here we consider the relationship between the contact of submanifolds with foliations and the @xmath80-class of functions .",
    "let @xmath81 be submanifolds of @xmath25 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 be immersion germs and @xmath84 be submersion germs .",
    "for a submersion germ @xmath85 , we have the regular foliation @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 ; i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "we say that _ the contact of @xmath89 with the regular foliation @xmath90 _ at @xmath91 is of the _ same type _ as _ the contact of @xmath92 with the regular foliation @xmath93 _ at @xmath94 if there is a diffeomorphism germ @xmath95 such that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 for each @xmath99 .",
    "in this case we write @xmath100 .",
    "we apply the method of goryunov@xcite to the case for @xmath80-equivalences among function germs .",
    "then we have the following proposition :    ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) let @xmath81 be submanifolds of @xmath25 with @xmath101 ( i.e. hypersurfaces ) , @xmath83 be immersion germs and @xmath84 be submersion germs . then @xmath100 if and only if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath80-equivalent .",
    "on the other hand , we define a function @xmath104 by @xmath105 for any @xmath106 , we write @xmath107 and we have a hypersphere @xmath108 for any @xmath109 it is easy to show that @xmath110 is a submersion . for any @xmath111 , we consider @xmath112",
    ". then we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the hyperspheres @xmath116 are tangent to @xmath9 at @xmath117 . in this case",
    ", we call each one of @xmath118 a _ tangent hypersphere _ at @xmath117 with the center @xmath119 however , there are infinitely many tangent hyperspheres at a general point @xmath117 depending on the real number @xmath120 if @xmath121 is a point of the focal set ( i.e. , @xmath122 for some @xmath123 ) , the tangent hypersphere with the center @xmath121 is called the _ osculating hypersphere _ ( or , _ curvature hypersphere _ ) at @xmath117 which is uniquely determined .",
    "for @xmath124 we also have regular foliations @xmath125 whose leaves are hyperspheres with the center @xmath126 such that the case @xmath127 corresponds to the tangent hypersphere with radius @xmath128 moreover , if @xmath129 then @xmath130 is the osculating hypersphere . in this case",
    "@xmath131 is a singular foliation germ at @xmath48 which is called an _ osculating hyperspherical foliation _ of @xmath9 at @xmath117 ( or , @xmath48 ) .",

    ". let @xmath144 @xmath145 be hypersurface germs .",
    "we consider distance squared functions @xmath146 of @xmath147 , where @xmath148 we write @xmath149 , then we have @xmath150",
    ". then we have the following theorem :    let @xmath151 @xmath145 be hypersurface germs such that the corresponding graph - like legendrian unfolding germs @xmath152 are @xmath153-legendrian stable ( i.e. , the corresponding lagrangian submanifold germs @xmath154 are lagrangian stable ) , where @xmath155 are centers of the osculating hyperspheres of @xmath147 respectively .",
    "then the following conditions are equivalent :                          we remark that if @xmath178 and @xmath179 are lagrangian equivalent , then the corresponding caustics are diffeomorphic .",
    "since the caustic of @xmath180 is the focal set of a hypersurface @xmath181 the above theorem gives a symplectic interpretation for the contact of hypersurfaces with family of hyperspheres .",
    "moreover , the @xmath153-diffeomorphism between the graph - like wave front sets sends the maxwell stratified sets to each other .",
    "therefore , we have the following corollary .              recently the author has discovered an application of the theory of graph - like legendrian unfoldings to the caustics of world sheets in lorentz space forms . in the theory of relativity",
    ", we do not have the notion of time constant , so that everything that is moving depends on the time .",
    "therefore , we have to consider world sheets instead of spacelike submanifolds .",

    "we say that a non - zero vector @xmath190 is _ spacelike , lightlike or timelike _ if @xmath191 @xmath192 or @xmath193 , respectively . here , @xmath194 is the induced pseudo - scalar product of @xmath195 we only consider the local situation here .",
    "let @xmath196 be a timelike embedding of codimension @xmath197 where @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) is an open subset and @xmath200 an open interval .",
    "we write @xmath201 and identify @xmath202 and @xmath203 via the embedding @xmath204 here , the embedding @xmath11 is said to be _ timelike _ if the tangent space @xmath205 of @xmath202 at @xmath206 is a timelike subspace ( i.e. , lorentz subspace of @xmath207 ) for any point @xmath208 .",
    "we write @xmath209 for each @xmath210 we call @xmath211 a _ spacelike foliation _ on @xmath202 if @xmath212 is a spacelike submanifold for any @xmath210 here , we say that @xmath212 is _ spacelike _ if the tangent space @xmath213 consists only spacelike vectors ( i.e. , spacelike subspace ) for any point @xmath214 we call @xmath212 a _ momentary space _ of @xmath211 .",
    "we say that @xmath215 ( or , @xmath11 itself ) is a _ world sheet _ if @xmath202 is time - orientable .",

    "the lightlike hypersurface of a spacelike submanifold in a lorentz space form has been defined and investigated in @xcite .",

    "we remark that the situation is different from the riemannian case .",
    "the lightlike hypersurface is a wave front in @xmath188 , so that the focal set is the set of legendrian singular values . in the riemannian case ,",
    "the focal set is the set of lagrangian singular values . in the lorentzian case",
    ", we consider world sheets instead of a single spacelike submanifold .",
    "since a world sheet is a one - parameter family of spacelike submanifolds , we can naturally apply the theory of wave front propagations .",

    "one of the motivations for investigating this case is given in the brane world scenario ( cf .",
    ", @xcite ) . there ,",
    "lightlike hypersurfaces and caustics along world sheets have been considered in the simplest case .",
