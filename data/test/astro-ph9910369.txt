    "the high signal to noise ratio spectra obtained with the 10 m keck telescope have revealed the presence of civ absorption lines associated with 75% of the lines with column densities @xmath15 and 90% of the ones with @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the lines with @xmath16 show only an order of magnitude range in ionization ratios .",
    "these observations indicate that , although of low metallicities , these clouds are not made of pristine material , which in turn suggests the existence of a very first generation of massive stars contaminating the intergalactic medium with heavy elements ( @xcite ) as they turned supernovae .    a possible association with galaxies which could also explain their metal content as processed gas is unclear ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "at low redshift , where the detection of galaxies is fairly complete to low - luminosity , a consensus appears that the largest column density  systems are distributed more like galaxies than the low column density ones ( @xmath17 or rest equivalent width @xmath18   ; see @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence that lower column density systems also correlate with galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though impey et al . found that it is not possible to assign uniquely a galaxy counterpart to an absorber , and that there is no support for absorbers to be located preferentially with the haloes of luminous galaxies .",
    "extrapolations of these  cloud - galaxy correlations to @xmath19 ( in the general context of galaxy and density perturbation distributions ) are consistent with observed  cloud clustering properties , which have only revealed signals on very small velocity scales ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1997 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",

    "theoretically , mcdonald & miralda - escud ( 1999 ) calculated the correlation function in three dimensions for the  forest between lines of sight separated by @xmath36 arcmin , suggesting that such a method could be used to measure cosmological parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .    on larger scales , correlated  absorption between lines of sight separated by several tens of arcmin",

    "a marginal correlation in the  forest has been suggested on the @xmath39 scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise ,  forest correlations on large angular scales have remained largely unexplored .",
    "a parallel analysis of the same south galactic pole spectra as used here was carried out by liske et al .",
    "it uses a new method to study correlations based on the statistics of transmitted flux .",

    "@xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ) and an analytical study ( @xcite ) suggest that  clouds are associated with filaments or large , flattened structures , similar to zeldovich pancakes , associated with low overdensity of the dark matter distribution ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "such structures may be detectable as correlations in the  forest toward groups of adjacent qsos .",
    "detailed analyses for the observable effects of such @xmath47 comoving mpc scale structures toward groups of qsos on the sky have not been performed , though much smaller scales ( @xmath48 comoving mpc ) have been considered ( @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the   forest toward ten @xmath49 qsos concentrated within a @xmath39 diameter field near the sgp is used as a probe for the existence of @xmath47 comoving mpc scale structures transverse to the lines of sight . in  2 , we review the observational data used in the analysis . in  3 , we describe the statistical tests made , and the results we obtained .",
    "we discuss the implications of the correlations we find in  4 . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "the location of the qsos on the sky and details of the observations and reductions are presented in paper  i. the instrumental resolution was @xmath52  , which allows us to resolve lines with a velocity difference of @xmath53  at @xmath54 . the signal to noise ratio per 1   pixel reaches up to 40 between the  and ly @xmath55 emission lines .",

    "the mean 1@xmath21 uncertainty in wavelength centroids is @xmath56 .",
    "the sample used for the analysis contains all the  lines with rest equivalent widths @xmath57   detected at the 5@xmath21 significance level and which lie between the  and   emission line wavelengths . however , we have excluded lines that belong to known metal absorbers ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) or lie within @xmath58  from the background qso .",
    "the latter condition has been set to avoid uncertainties introduced by the `` proximity effect '' ( which reduces the line number density and the equivalent widths of the lines ) .",
    "the line sample is thus a subset taken from table 2 of paper  i , and consists of 383  lines at @xmath59 .",
    "however , we note that completeness is only reached over the whole set of spectra for lines with @xmath60   .",
    "it is now generally accepted that there are very few ly-@xmath50 lines with @xmath61  lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , all lines with @xmath62   observed here have @xmath63 . figure  [ fig : coneplot ] presents the locations and rest equivalent widths of the absorbers projected onto the right ascension and declination planes .",
    "each individual line of sight shows no unusual distribution of absorption systems with redshift or rest equivalent width .",
    "we used the program sewage ( sophisticated and efficient @xmath64 and gamma estimator ) , kindly provided to us by dobrzycki ( 1999 ) .",
    "the redshift number density of @xmath65   lines is consistent with a power law distribution ( @xcite ) @xmath66 , with a maximum likelihood value @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding rest equivalent width distribution is consistent with @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "we find no large voids in any line sample defined by a minimum rest equivalent width , following the method described in ostriker , bajtlik , & duncan ( 1988 ) .",
    "the instrumental resolution of @xmath52   makes the minimum detected separation in a single spectrum between lines of strongly different strengths to be @xmath70 , which corresponds to 1.01.7 @xmath14 comoving mpc along the line of sight over @xmath71 .",
    "the two closest lines of sight in our sample are 6.1 arcmin apart ( toward q00422656 and q00422657 , whose common ly@xmath50 forest coverage lies in the range @xmath72 ) or 5.2  @xmath14 comoving mpc in the plane of the sky . therefore , despite the unprecedented number of close lines of sight , we do not expect that our study would _ a priori _ bring any new result for structure on small scales : on the one hand , a few high signal to noise ratio spectra  already existing in the literature  would be sufficient to reveal structures larger than 5 @xmath14 comoving mpc ( e.g. @xcite ) , and on the other , spectra of close quasar pairs have already been studied to search for ( and find ) structure at the @xmath73 mpc scale ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the angular separation between any two lines of sight actually ranges from 6.1 to 69.2 arcmin ( 5.2@xmath14 to 52.7@xmath14 comoving mpc ) . between two and seven lines of sight probe",
    "any given redshift over @xmath74 .",
    "the  forest spectral coverage corresponds to a region with a depth of 470 @xmath14 comoving mpc along the line of sight .",
    "the following subsections describe the statistical analysis we performed to search for structures in the  forest spanning two or more lines of sight . in  [ subsec : controls ] , we detail the construction of random control samples of  forest spectra and line lists , which are free of correlations .",
    "the control samples will be used to determine the significance of any features we find in various forms of the  forest correlation function and redshift distribution .",
    "we then test for structures extended in three dimensions (  [ subsec:3d_structures ] ) and in the plane of the sky (  [ subsec : plane_sky ] ) .",
    "we realize that the spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio of the spectra are barely adequate for the study of the dense ly-@xmath50 forest at @xmath75 . in addition , the specific , irregular arrangement of detection windows in redshift space and lines of sight could create a subtle pattern of aliasing on large scales , comparable to the separation between lines of sight and the extent that each spectrum probes along the line of sight . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we created control samples free of correlations between absorbers .",
    "these control samples should have characteristics as similar as possible to the observed spectra .",
    "this section describes how we reached that goal .",
    "we simulated the data directly from the  absorber distribution functions in  column density and doppler parameter as recently determined using keck ",
    "hires spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "since they provide the distribution characteristics for 3 different mean redshifts , interpolation functions are needed to accommodate the fast redshift evolution of the different parameters involved .",
    "we find that the following functions described well the data in the redshift range @xmath76 .",
    "their validity is doubtful outside this range .",
    "the number density of ly-@xmath50 clouds per unit absorption length @xmath77 and per unit column density @xmath78 is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 in order to reproduce the break in the column density distribution observed at @xmath82 ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite ) , we randomly eliminated 75% of the @xmath83 lines with @xmath84 .",
    "although the data show a more gradual break with redshift , we find that this simple method is good enough for our purpose to produce control samples .",
    "the doppler parameter distribution is described by a gaussian with a cut - off at low @xmath85 values : @xmath86 the doppler parameters depend on @xmath87 in the following way : @xmath88 @xmath89 the low cut - off value @xmath90 , independently of redshift .",
    "a random process is used to determine the wavelengths of the lines so that their distribution is poissonian in redshift .",
    "the mean redshift density is set to be equal to the value expected by integrating equation  ( [ eq : f_z ] ) over the column density range @xmath91 at the given @xmath87 ; we use the relation @xmath92 , which is valid for the value @xmath93 adopted by kim et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , so that the simulations are independent of the cosmological parameters .",
    "values for the column density and the doppler parameter @xmath85 were then independently attributed to each line , following the distributions described above .    given the redshift , column density and doppler parameter for each line ( the _ input line list _ ) , voigt profiles can be calculated .",
    "the resulting high - resolution spectrum is then convolved with a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) of 2  fwhm , and rebinned so that its sampling is equivalent to the corresponding individual qso spectrum which it simulates .",
    "photon and read - out noise have been added so that the final spectrum has a signal to noise ratio comparable , at each wavelength , to that of the corresponding observed spectrum .",
    "such a method naturally accounts for cosmic variance .",
    "we used the same software to search automatically for absorption lines in the simulated spectra as we did for the observed data ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) .",
    "we derived for the simulations and the data the redshift distribution index @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 , rest equivalent width distribution index @xmath64 defined by @xmath96 and the distribution of the total number of lines with rest equivalent width @xmath97 .",
    "we also compared @xmath94 and @xmath64 to values from bechtold ( 1994 ) .",
    "her total sample consists mainly of her medium resolution sample ( spectral resolution generally between 50 and 100   fwhm , @xmath98 @xmath99 detection limit , weighted by redshift coverage , of 0.172  ) , which is higher resolution and only marginally noisier than ours ( @xmath100  fwhm , mean @xmath98 @xmath99 detection limit of 0.165  ) .",
    "the redshift index @xmath94 for the simulations agrees well with the values from bechtold and the independence of @xmath94 with resolution ( parnell & carswell 1988 ) , and is consistent with our observed data ( figure  [ fig : gammavsw0 ] ) .",
    "the rest equivalent width index @xmath64 for the simulations is consistent with our data ( figure  [ fig : wstarvsw0 ] ) .",
    "the bechtold data indicate a larger number of low @xmath99 lines relative to high @xmath99 lines than in our sample , as expected for the difference in spectral resolution .",
    "the distribution of the total number of lines @xmath97 is very consistent with the simulations ( figure  [ fig : nvsw0 ] ) .",
    "we used between 100 and 1000 synthetic spectra as controls for the calculations in this paper .",
    "we used two different methods to search for correlations of   forest absorbers in three dimensions : ( 1 ) the two point correlation function , and ( 2 ) the redshift number density .",
    ". two point correlation function : _ we constructed the two point correlation function in three dimensions as in paper  i. however , we did not use the estimator @xmath101 of davis & peebles ( 1983 ) , in which the observed data ( @xmath102 ) are cross - correlated with a randomly generated data set ( @xmath103 ) to provide the normalization for the distribution for the absorber pairs .",
    "the absorption line density is so high in the higher redshift portion of our data that we would not be able to detect absorber separations much smaller than observed .",
    "rather , we used the @xmath104 estimator , and computed the average and first moment about the mean of the two point correlation function directly from the simulations .",
    "we found no significant signal in the observed data , nor in any subset of the data as a function of redshift or rest equivalent width detection threshold .",
    "we performed a heuristic check that our algorithm would indeed reveal any clustering , by creating an artificial cluster in the simulated data .",
    "the artificial cluster was produced by adding a 100% overdensity of absorbers in the redshift range @xmath105 into the input line list used for a set of simulated spectra ; these absorbers are common and identical for all quasars of a given set . their characteristics ( @xmath106 were obtained following the same procedure that produces the input line list described above .",
    "the redshift range is the best - sampled one in our data , as it is probed , at least partially , by six qso sightlines for which we have high signal to noise ratio spectra .",
    "this artificial cluster would cover approximately @xmath107 comoving mpc@xmath42 on the plane of the sky , and span @xmath108 comoving mpc along the line of sight ; it would be as extended along the line - of - sight as the  groups described in paper  i , and slightly wider on the plane of the sky .",
    "we produced 100 simulated sets of spectra with such an artificial cluster , and determined the corresponding three dimensional correlation function in the same way as for the observed data .",
    "due to line blending , the mean number of `` detected '' lines in the artificially overdense region increases only by 27% , compared to the mean number of lines in the simulated spectra with no artificial cluster .",
    "however , the mean rest equivalent width of the lines in that interval increases by 41% from @xmath109   to @xmath110  , but is not detected significantly since the first moment about the mean is @xmath111 in both cases .",
    "similarly , we created artificially clustered data sets with overdensities of 25% and 100% at @xmath112 .",
    "we do not find any evidence for a significant signal in three dimensional two point correlation function for any of the artificially correlated cases .",
    "redshift number density : _ for a second test , we computed the redshift distributions of the observed absorbers toward all lines of sight in our sample .",
    "we compare the observed number of absorbers @xmath113 with the expected mean and first moment about the mean from the simulations @xmath114 , @xmath115 , to define a significance level @xmath116 .",
    "the data produce no significant features in for a variety of rest equivalent width detection thresholds ( figure  [ fig : dndzobssim ] ) .",
    "the most significant feature is an overdensity of lines ( @xmath117 ) at @xmath118 which is strongest when weak lines ( @xmath119  ) are included in the sample .",
    "this redshift range partially includes the one covered by a group of  absorbers found in paper  i , whose corresponding   lines have already been removed from our sample .",
    "we therefore find no significant evidence for an overdensity of absorbers in a given redshift interval in the observed data .",
    "to test the sensitivity of the redshift distribution to the presence of clustered  lines , we also calculated  for the three artificially clustered data sets .",
    "only the 100% overdense case at @xmath118 produces a detectable signal ( at @xmath120 level ) in the line number density ( figure  [ fig : artcluster ] ) .",
    "we do not detect any significant structures extended in three dimensions in the observed data , and also conclude that the three dimensional two point correlation function is a less sensitive indicator of clustering in the  forest in three dimensions than the redshift number density .",
    "in contrast to the two point correlation function in three dimensions , the two point correlation function in velocity space @xmath121 has successfully revealed ( apparent ) clustering ( as there is no way to separate out peculiar velocities ) in the  forest between lines of sight on the scale of up to 3 arcmin ( @xcite ) . in order to extend the exploration of such correlations on scales up to 69 arcmin , we calculated @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the velocity difference between two lines detected at @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the spectra of two _ different _ quasars , where @xmath126 is the speed of light .",
    "we computed the first moment about the mean  directly from the simulated control sample line lists .",
    "a 50  bin size was chosen , which is more than 3 times larger than the typical error on the determination of the observed lines centroid .",
    "it is large enough so that each bin contains on average at least 67 lines drawn from the control sample .",
    "this test is sensitive for structures with large transverse extent in the plane of the sky , but not necessarily large extent along the line of sight .",
    "if we include the entire redshift range of our data sample , the most deviant feature of the two point correlation function @xmath128 is a @xmath129 excess of pairs with @xmath130    absorption lines and velocity differences @xmath131 ( figure  [ fig : twoptcorrz215326 ] ) .",
    "we then divided the sample using criteria based on the redshift , rest equivalent width and angular separation between the different lines of sight to search for the origin of this possible signal .",
    "limiting the line redshifts to the range @xmath127 reveals an overdensity of line pairs significant at the @xmath132 confidence level ( figure  [ fig : twoptcorrz260326 ] and table  [ tab - zdependence_50ltdvlt100 ] ) : our observations provide 79 pairs of @xmath130   lines in the @xmath133 velocity bin , an excess of 42% compared to a mean and @xmath134 dispersion of only @xmath135 derived from the control sample .",
    "the probability of finding such an excess in _ any _ bin is @xmath136 .",

    "the ks test and the distribution of variances indicate that the probability of the observed nearest neighbor distribution arising from a random distribution of absorbers is small , though the exact probability is difficult to determine because the estimates between the two methods differ by a factor of 360 . a better understanding of the signal can be obtained with a more detailed model , which we describe in the next section .",
    "the origin of the correlation is mysterious if the result is taken at face value , that is , if the excess of pairs really occurs at @xmath201 , and does not actually peak at @xmath202 .",
    "indeed , all physically plausible models which we have considered , i.e. sheets , filaments or any other connected structures spanning 30 arcmin on the sky , that would give a signal between @xmath201 at large angular separation , would also give a signal between @xmath203 at small @xmath181 .",
    "since the number of line pairs per bin is comparable at @xmath204 and 30 arcmin , any such model would lead to a signal of similar strength in these two velocity bins .    as the accuracy of the line wavelength",
    "is thought to be of the order 13 , if the ` real ' correlation is actually at @xmath205 , the effect of underestimating the accuracy of the line center measurement would _ a priori _ only broaden the peak of the correlation , not its centroid .",
    "however , the blending of several ly@xmath50 lines due to the low spectral resolution can account for the observed @xmath206 of the correlation peak if the signal to noise ratio is not very good .    in order to test this hypothesis , we modified the generation of the simulated spectra described in ",
    "[ subsec : controls ] .",
    "specifically , we changed the way the input line list is produced before the creation of the voigt profiles , in such a way as to introduce a correlation between the different lines of sight , while conserving the mean density of ( input ) lines per unit redshift .",
    "first , we produced a new input line list following the same parameters as the ones described in ",
    "[ subsec : controls ] , but extending over the redshift range whose limits are the minimal and maximal redshifts covered by our spectra .",
    "let us call this input line list the full - range line list , @xmath207 , where @xmath208 . similarly , let us call the input line list for the spectra @xmath209 , with @xmath210 , where @xmath211 identifies the quasar .",
    "two additional input parameters are needed : @xmath212 , which describes the percentage of input lines to be common to each new input line list , and @xmath213 , which gives the velocity dispersion of the common line lists along the different lines - of - sight .",
    "the new input line list @xmath214 for the quasar @xmath215 is created in the following way .",
    "it is the union of two sets of lines .",
    "the first set of lines is common to each quasar .",
    "it originates from the full - range line list @xmath216 : each line @xmath217 has a probability @xmath212 to be included in each new line list @xmath214 ; the values of @xmath218 and @xmath219 are identical in each @xmath214 , but the redshift @xmath220 is modified to include a peculiar velocity , whose value follows a gaussian distribution with the velocity dispersion @xmath213 .",
    "the second set of lines is unique to each quasar and comes from the line lists @xmath221 : each line @xmath222 has a probability @xmath223 of being included ( as it is ) in the line list @xmath214 .",
    "the rest of the procedure is then identical to the one described in ",
    "[ subsec : controls ] .",
    "it is important to note that the percentage of common lines in the input line list is not necessarily reflected in the ` observed ' line list , as mentioned in  [ subsec:3d_structures ] .",
    "the blending due both to the intrinsic width of the lines and to the 2    spectral resolution ( 1 ) leads relatively weak lines to disappear into the wings of stronger lines , and ( 2 ) makes several lines with small wavelength separation appear as one .",
    "these effects are revealed in the results of the following test .",
    "we computed the value of the two point correlation function for different values of @xmath212 and @xmath213 by creating 1000 simulations for each pair @xmath224 considered .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma_sigma ] presents some of the results , expressed in confidence level in the second bin ( @xmath225 ) _ vs. _ the confidence level in the first bin ( @xmath226 ) . in each case , the asterisk symbol indicates the values obtained with the observed data .",
    "the top left panel shows the results when no line is ( arbitrarily ) common between the different lines - of - sight : as expected , there are very few cases where a false positive signal is detected . in this set of 1000 simulations , there is only 1 case when a value is larger than @xmath227 in either of the two bins .",
    "we also note two other false positive cases of negative correlation , also at greater than the 3@xmath185 level .",
    "if 10% of the lines are common @xmath228 to each line - of - sight with a velocity dispersion of @xmath229 ( top middle panel ) , then the correlation is detected at the @xmath227 level in at least 1 of the two first bins in only about 4% of the cases , with the detection in the 2nd bin alone accounting for 25% of these cases .",
    "even if 20% of the lines are common with @xmath230 , the correlation function does not consistently show any significant signal : moreover , the quadratic sum of the significance level in the two first bins does not reveal any signal at more than 3@xmath185 in 64% of the cases .",
    "cccccccccc & 0.2 & 2.5 & 7.4 & 7.0 & 8.7 & 17.2 & 33.8 & 22.2 & 40.2 +    as can be seen in the different panels , the effect of increasing the number of common lines @xmath212 is to move the set of points approximately along the diagonal of equal confidence limits towards larger values , while a larger velocity dispersion increases their spread perpendicular to this direction and reduces the number of bins with significant signals .",
    "these simulations , whose results are summarized in table [ tab : probability ] , show that it is unlikely that the signal that we detect is a statistical fluke ; on the contrary , it probably indicates that a significant number of lines are common between the different lines - of - sight with a velocity dispersion probably larger than @xmath231 .",
    "unfortunately , the limited spectral resolution of our data does not allow us to quantify this result better .",
    "we have searched for correlations among a sample of 383 @xmath130   ( 5@xmath21 detection threshold )  absorbers ranging over @xmath59 in front of 10 qsos separated by @xmath232 , an angular separation an order of magnitude greater than for any other study for more than a simple pair of qsos .",
    "our statistical tests have consisted of the three dimensional two point correlation function , the redshift distribution , and the two point correlation function in redshift space .",
    "we have found no evidence for clustering in the the three dimensional two point correlation function , and no anomalies in the absorber redshift distribution .",
    "in fact , we find that the three dimensional two point correlation function is less sensitive to clusters of   absorbers than .",
    "we have calculated the two point correlation function in velocity space and find a signal of @xmath233 with significance @xmath132 at velocity separation @xmath234 for a subsample at @xmath127 and @xmath130  .",
    "its significance rises to @xmath235 if the rest equivalent width is restricted to @xmath236 , but tends to weaken with increasing minimum values of @xmath99",
    ". however , given the limited sample size , we do not draw any stronger conclusion than that the significance of the signal does not strongly increase with the minimum value of @xmath99 .",
    "additional simulations show that blending due to the low spectral resolution of our spectra may often destroy any signal even if most of the lines are common between the lines of sight .",
    "however , they also show that if any signal is detected in any of the first few bins , it is unlikely to be due to chance .",
    "instead , such a signal very often reveals the presence of an underlying correlation . if the correlation that we find is only the strongest part of an underlying distribution , which may extend over a larger range in velocity space , then the analysis of a larger and higher resolution data sample should confirm the reality of the feature .",
    "physically , a correlation at such a small velocity dispersion could arise from the apparent collapse of structures along the line of sight ( the `` bulls - eye effect '' , @xcite ; @xcite ) , reducing their apparent extent in velocity space .",
    "furthermore , if such structures contain  absorbers on the scale of 1030 arcmin , or 8.726 ( 1340 ) @xmath14 comoving mpc for @xmath11 ( 0.2 ) , then density gradients within the structures could explain the difference between the clustering of strong absorbers that crotts & fang found on small angular scales , and of weaker absorbers which we find on larger scales .",
    "overdensities and underdensities on the scale of a few tens of comoving mpc have been identified along individual lines of sight ( @xcite ) , so similar features in the plane of the sky are plausible .",
    "oort ( 1981 , 1983 , 1984 ) suggested that correlated  absorption on @xmath237 scales could be the signature of high redshift superclusters arising from  pancake \" formations .",
    "simulations of the growth of cosmological structures ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ) indicate that structures ( e.g. filaments / sheets ) of dark matter and gas extend up to several mpc , forming a  cosmic web \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "such structures produce  absorption up to 7 comoving mpc from luminous galaxies or groups of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of simulations can yield quantitative predictions for the  forest correlation function in the larger context of galaxy formation ( on scales of @xmath238 mpc , @xcite ) , and permit the recovery of power spectrum of density perturbations ( on scales of up to @xmath239 mpc , @xcite ) , though at present , the small size of the simulation boxes does not permit similar predictions on the scale probed by our data .",
    "our observations indicate that structures coherent over more than 7 comoving mpc may well exist in the  forest at @xmath240 .",
    "as simulations become more advanced and box sizes increase , it will be possible to compare model structures to those of the scale we find in our data .",
    "the correlations of the  lines in velocity space imply large scale structure extending over 30 arcmin , or about @xmath241 comoving mpc for @xmath242 .",
    "the comparison between   absorbers on such wide angular scales provides a unique tool to probe the evolution of large scale structure at high redshift . with 810 m class telescopes",
    ", it will be possible to survey fainter qsos , which would provide a much higher density per unit area on the sky and thus enable a much more detailed probe of the correlation behavior of qso absorption systems .",
    "it will also be possible to detect routinely bright galaxies in the vicinity of such correlated absorbers , to reveal more details about the relationship between the two sorts of objects and to the distribution of matter in general .",
    "we appreciate useful conversations with a. crotts , v. icke , v. khersonsky , j. liske , p. mller , p. petitjean , p. shaver , a. szalay and r. van de weygaert , and hospitality from european southern observatory through its visitor program .",
