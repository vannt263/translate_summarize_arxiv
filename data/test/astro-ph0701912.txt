    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are the most important standardized candles for cosmology , and have been used to discover dark energy and the accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "this was facilitated by the realization that supernovae with broader lightcurves are intrinsically brighter , while those with narrow lightcurves are dimmer @xcite . various schemes exist to correct sn ia luminosities based on their lightcurve shape  here we use the `` stretch '' method , in which the time axis of a template lightcurve is multiplied by a scale factor @xmath6 to fit the data @xcite .    some properties of sne ia",
    "have been found to correlate with environment  brighter supernovae with broader lightcurves ( high @xmath6 ) tend to occur in late - type spiral galaxies @xcite , while dimmer , fast declining ( low @xmath6 ) supernovae are preferentially located in an older stellar population , leading to the conclusion that the age of the progenitor system is a key variable affecting sn ia properties @xcite .",
    "the fact that supernovae occur at a much higher rate in late type galaxies , and that the sn ia rate is proportional to the core - collapse rate is another indication that age plays an essential role . following this previous work , @xcite model sne ia as consisting of two populations",
    " a `` prompt '' component whose rate is proportional to the star formation rate of the host galaxy , and a second `` delayed '' component whose rate is proportional to the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "* hereafter s06 ) tie all of these results together using data from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , finding that slow declining , brighter sne ia come from a young population and have a rate proportional to star formation on a 0.5 gyr timescale , while dimmer , faster declining supernovae come from a much older population with a rate proportional to the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "s06 and @xcite predict that the sne ia whose rates are proportional to star formation will start to dominate the total sample of sne as cosmic star formation increases with redshift . since these sne are intrinsically brighter , the mean luminosity of the population should increase with redshift .",
    "here we use the two - component sn ia model of @xcite and the stretch distribution for each component from snls data ( s06 ) to quantify the expected magnitude of this effect .",
    "we then compare the predicted evolution in lightcurve stretch to sn distributions from the snls and the higher - z sn search @xcite .",
    "@xcite parameterize the supernova rate in a galaxy as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total stellar mass in the galaxy , @xmath9 is the star formation rate , and a and b are constants .",
    "these authors use the supernova rates in galaxies of different morphologies and colors to derive values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "s06 use an alternate method  they fit galaxy models to snls @xmath12 host galaxy photometry to derive masses and star formation rates . then , using the cosmic star formation history of @xcite , s06 predict the rate of sne from each component versus redshift in their fig . 10 . note",
    "that here we adopt the same definition of @xmath13 as s06  it is the mass turned into stars and does not include mass loss from supernovae .    the prompt and delayed sn ia components",
    "have different stretch distributions ( s06 ) . to determine the stretch of each sn , here we use the sne from s06 , though we fit a new lightcurve template to the data using the sifto method @xcite . because stretches are always defined relative to the @xmath14 template lightcurve , stretch values",
    "should only compared within a publication . however , the stretches derived here are approximately 4% larger than those in , largely due to the use of a narrower @xmath14 template .",
    "all sne from passive galaxies ( i.e. those with no measurable star formation rate ) were assigned to the @xmath10 component .",
    "star forming galaxies have sne ia from both components , so the @xmath10 distribution from passive galaxies was scaled by mass and subtracted from the distribution of sne ia from star forming galaxies , leaving the @xmath11 distribution ( as in s06 ) .",
    "the resulting distributions , and gaussian fits are shown in figure  [ abdist ] .",
    "note that to conserve the total number of sne one should add the sne subtracted from the @xmath11 distribution back to the @xmath10 distribution  this is unnecessary for our purposes because the relative heights of the gaussians are normalized as a function of redshift in the next step .    to estimate the expected stretch evolution with redshift , we take the observed @xmath10 and @xmath11 distributions and scale them to the predicted relative values with redshift from fig . 10 of s06 .",
    "increasing cosmic star formation with redshift produces a larger fraction of sne from the prompt component .",
    "stellar mass as a function of redshift is determined by integrating the star formation history from the earliest times , so the total stellar mass , and the number of sne from the a component , decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "the net result is that in the @xmath15 model the mean stretch increases from 0.98 at @xmath16 to 1.04 at @xmath5 .",
    "one caveat is that in the @xmath15 model there is no time dependence for the @xmath10 component .",
    "sne ia from 10 gyr old progenitors are just as likely as sne ia from 3 gyr old progenitors .",
    "if 10 gyr - old sne ia are actually more rare , the @xmath15 model will overpredict the number of @xmath10-component sne at @xmath16 , as they result from stars formed during the high star formation rate in the early universe ( see discussion in s06 ) . as an alternative to the @xmath15 model we tested the two component sn ia delay time distribution from @xcite , which has an exponential decrease in supernova probability from the delayed component with time .",
    "the drawback of this model is that the probability distribution is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "also , rather than the 50 - 50 split between prompt and delayed sne chosen by @xcite , here we scale each component by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 values measured by s06 .",
    "this gives similar results to the @xmath15 model , predicting a shift in mean stretch from 0.98 to 1.02 from @xmath0 .",
    "in figure  [ gaussreal ] we compare the predicted stretch distributions from the @xmath15 model to the observed stretch distributions in three redshift bins from the low redshift data used by , the snls data in s06 , and the data of the higher - z supernova search @xcite .",
    "all lightcurves have been refit here using the same method .",
    "we also tested the data against the modified @xcite model , but we did not find it to be a better predictor of sn evolution with redshift ( table  [ table ] ) .",
    "ccccc 0 - 0.1 & 0.81 & 0.63 & 15% & 39% + 0.1 - 0.75 & 0.64 & 0.83 & 30% & 28% + 0.75 - 1.5 & 0.60 & 0.84 & 52% &",
    "35% +    each survey has different selection effects ",
    "the most serious for the current study is malmquist bias , the tendency to discover only the brightest members of a group near the detection limit of a magnitude - limited survey . to minimize the effect , for each of the high redshift searches we only consider supernovae from a reduced volume so that none of the supernovae used are near the magnitude limit .",
    "the snls regularly discovers sne ia out to @xmath17 , but here we use only the subset with @xmath18 , where malmquist bias is minimal .",
    "similarly , we only use @xcite sne with @xmath19 , where the authors report their sample is complete @xcite .",
    "lowering the redshift cuttoff to @xmath20 does not change the average stretch for the highest - z sample , but it reduces the sample size from 20 to 13 , and thus decreases the significance of the results .    as an additional protection against selection bias , we only consider sne with @xmath21 .",
    "sne ia with @xmath22 are both dim and spectoscopically peculiar , like sn 1991bg @xcite , and have not yet been detected at @xmath23 , probably because of a combination of malmquist bias and spectroscopic selection bias @xcite  as redshift increases , and the angular size of the host galaxy decreases , and it becomes more and more difficult to spectroscopically identify such faint supernovae when blended with their bright , often elliptical , hosts .",
    "this cut removes 3 sne ia from the low - z sample [ other low - z sne are already removed because we only consider hubble - flow sne ia , with @xmath24 , to be consistent with ] .    in all cases",
    "we use only sne ia with at least 4 lightcurve points , and at least one detection before 10 rest - frame days after maximum light in the @xmath11-band , so that stretch is accurately measured .",
    "figure  [ gaussreal ] shows that the average observed stretch increases with redshift , from @xmath25 at a median redshift of @xmath26 , to @xmath27 at @xmath28 , and @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "simultaneously the percentage of sne ia with @xmath31 decreases from 24% to 15% to 1.4% .",
    "the ks test gives a 2% probability that the lowest and highest redshift sample are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the predicted distributions from the @xmath15 model are overplotted .",
    "the observed trends match the predictions of the empirically - based models  with increasing redshift fewer low - stretch sne ia are observed , and the mean sn ia stretch increases .",
    "we find the same result when this analysis is repeated with the salt and salt2 lightcurve fitters .",
    "these results are also consistent with the findings of , that the low - z sample had an average stretch 97% that of snls sne .",
    "estimate distances from sne ia using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the distance modulus , @xmath34 is the peak @xmath11-band magnitude , @xmath35 is a color , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are parameters fit by minimizing residuals on the hubble diagram",
    ". found @xmath39 , so a drift in average stretch of @xmath40 from @xmath26 to @xmath30 results in a 12% drift in average intrinsic sn ia luminosity over this redshift range .",
    "evolution in the sn population will not necessarily bias cosmological studies , since sne are only used in this way after correction for lightcurve shape .",
    "however , we can no longer assume that any deficiencies in lightcurve width correction schemes will average out under the assumption the distribution of sne is similar over all redshifts .",
    "if there is a systematic residual between low stretch and high stretch sne when they are stretch corrected , this could cause a bias in the determination of cosmological parameters as the population evolves .    to test an extreme case of evolution , we fit the equation of state parameter for dark energy , @xmath3 and the matter density , @xmath41 using the data from , ( dashed lines in fig .  [ lowhighs ] ) and compared it to a fit using the same data , but retaining only @xmath42 sne ia at @xmath43 and only @xmath44 sne ia at @xmath45 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the strongly evolving subset gives estimates for @xmath3 and @xmath41 consistent with the full set , although the errors are larger because there are fewer sne in the subset .",
    "one worry with an evolving population is that stretch - magnitude or color - magnitude relations may evolve , i.e. @xmath37 or @xmath38 derived at one redshift may not be appropriate at another .",
    "the values derived here for the strong evolution subset and the full set are consistent , but again a strong test awaits a larger data set .    measuring changes in @xmath3 with time will require much stricter control of potential evolutionary effects .",
    "possible biases depend critically on the exact nature of the evolution , the experimental design , the cosmology , and how the time variable component of @xmath3 is parameterized  e.g. @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 @xcite . however , a good rule of thumb is that to keep systematic errors significantly below statistical errors for a mission such as snap , the corrected magnitudes of sne ia should not drift by more than 0.02 mag up to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there are not enough well measured sne ia in the literature to determine whether or not stretch correction works to this level of precision .",
    "after stretch correction , the rms scatter of sne ia around the hubble line is @xmath49 mag in the best cases .",
    "therefore @xmath50 sne ia are required in each of several stretch or redshift bins to determine whether biases remain at the 0.02 level after correction .",
    "such precise tests will soon be possible by combining data from large surveys underway at low and high redshift .",
    "we have shown that there is some evolution in the average lightcurve width , and thus intrinsic luminosity of sne ia from @xmath16 to @xmath5 , although significant evolution is found only over a large redshift baseline .",
    "this evolution is consistent with our predictions from the @xmath15 model  as star formation increases with redshift , the broader - lightcurve sne ia associated with a young stellar population make up an increasingly larger fraction of sne ia .",
    "though we have taken steps to minimize the effects of malmquist bias , it is possible that residual effects play some role in increasing average stretch with redshift .",
    "however , the net effect on cosmology studies is the same no matter the underlying cause . in either case , there is increased pressure on the light curve shape calibration method to correct for the evolution in sn ia properties with redshift .",
    "@xcite found that sne ia still give evidence for an accelerating universe even if sne ia are not corrected for stretch .",
    "this was possible because the difference in a universe with dark energy and one with @xmath51 is large  0.25 magnitudes at @xmath52 , whereas the population evolution seen here implies that average sn ia magnitudes should increase by 0.07 mag over the same redshift range .",
    "however , discriminating between dark energy models requires much more precise control of sn ia magnitudes over a larger redshift baseline .",
    "most theoretical studies addressing possible sn ia evolution have focused on metallicity .",
    "although theorists have proposed various mechanisms that could conceivably alter the properties of sne ia as the average metallicity changes with cosmic time @xcite there is no consensus regarding which effects are important or even the sign of these effects .",
    "observational studies have found no evidence that metallicity affects the properties of sne ia @xcite .",
    "instead , it is more likely that age differences between the two populations ( and thus almost certainly the mass of the secondary star ) play a role in the evolution of the observed stretch distribution with redshift @xcite .",
    "prompt sne ia are thought to be brighter because they produce more @xmath53ni .",
    "if the chandrasekhar - mass model describes most sne ia , they must then produce less intermediate mass elements , assuming that the amount of unburned material is negligible in normal sne ia .",
    "we therefore predict that high redshift sne ia will have less ca and si .",
    "this is confirmed by the most intensive study of high redshift sn ia spectra @xcite .",
    "one concern raised by these findings is that pathological sne ia such as sn 2001ay @xcite , sn 2002cx @xcite , sn 2002ic @xcite , and snls-03d3bb @xcite , which do not obey typical lightcurve shape correction schemes , are associated with star formation . since star formation density increases by a factor of ten from @xmath16 to @xmath5 @xcite , at high redshift",
    "these pathological supernovae will be an order of magnitude more common .",
    "thus the conventional wisdom that all high redshift supernovae will have counterparts at low redshift @xcite only holds if sample sizes are much larger than those currently used for cosmology . only 20 sne  ia have published lightcurves at @xmath17 , and only @xmath5450 sne ia at @xmath55 have sufficient data to be cosmologically useful . fortunately , thus far it has been possible to identify these outliers so that they do not affect cosmological analyses , but future studies requiring increased precision must be vigilant of the effects of an evolving sn ia population ."
