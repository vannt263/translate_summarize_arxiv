    "in the late 70 s , montonen and olive discovered that a given four dimensional gauge theory might be described using different sets of elementary fields @xcite .",
    "the fields in one of this set create the standard perturbative spectrum of the theory ( photon , w bosons , quarks ,  ) , while the fields in the `` dual '' set correspond to the solitonic states ( dyons ) .",
    "an example of such a phenomenon was observed even before in some two dimensional theories @xcite .    since then , a natural and exciting question arose : can we find theories where the description in terms of the solitonic states is the same ( same field content and symmetries in the lagrangian ) as the description in terms of the perturbative states ? answering this question requires to understand the strong coupling behaviour of the gauge theories under study , since exchanging electrically charged perturbative states with magnetically charged solitonic states amounts to inverting the gauge coupling constant due to the dirac quantization condition .",
    "this was out of reach in the 70 s , though some important progress was made .",
    "first , it was realized that the natural arena for electric - magnetic duality was yang - mills theories with extended supersymmetries @xcite .",
    "second , it was pointed out that in order to have dyons of spin 1 , which could be the dual of the w bosons , @xmath1 supersymmetry seemed to be required @xcite .",
    "actually , an exact electric - magnetic duality , combined with the dirac quantization condition , implies that the @xmath8 function must vanish .",
    "this is indeed the only case where the electric coupling @xmath9 and the magnetic coupling @xmath10 , being constant , have the same behaviour under the renormalization group flow .",
    "the @xmath1 theory is known to be conformally invariant at the quantum level , perturbatively @xcite as well as non - perturbatively @xcite . at the perturbative level , this property is shared with some @xmath2 theories @xcite , which are believed to be finite even non - perturbatively at least when the rank of the gauge group is one .",
    "the latter theories are strongly believed to have , together with the @xmath1 theory , an exact electric - magnetic duality symmetry ; we will study them below .",
    "there are various ways to test these duality conjectures .",
    "one of them , advocated in @xcite , consists of looking at the ( hyper)elliptic curve from which the low energy physics can be deduced , and check whether some sensible duality transformations can be defined in order to insure exact electric - magnetic duality symmetry .",
    "another approach has been to look at the free energy @xcite .",
    "but the most popular test certainly is to determine the content of a particular sector of the hilbert space , the bps sector , and to check whether it is compatible with duality @xcite . to study solely the bps states",
    "is not too restrictive .",
    "actually , all the perturbative and known stable solitonic states are bps states . moreover ,",
    "this is in general a very accurate test .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the bps spectra of the asymptotically free @xmath2 theories certainly do not have the same symmetries as the associated ( hyper)elliptic curve .",
    "there are also some technical reasons to study the bps spectra .",
    "an exact quantum mass formula is known for these states , stemming from the fact that they lie in small representations of the supersymmetry algebra and thus saturate the bogomolnyi bound @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical quantization can give reliable results when one can go continuously from weak coupling to strong coupling without altering the stability of the states , which is the case for instance in the @xmath1 theory . and",
    ", what is maybe their most intriguing property , it seems that the bps spectra can be computed completely once one knows the low energy structure of the theory , that is all the information about these spectra seems to be contained , in a very hidden way , in the ( hyper)elliptic curve .    in this paper",
    ", i will study in detail the bps spectra of two @xmath2 theories having zero @xmath8 function .",
    "the first one will be the so(3 ) gauge theory with one flavour of bare mass @xmath11 , which reduces to the @xmath1 theory when @xmath12 , and the second one will be the su(2 ) gauge theory with four hypermultiplets whose bare masses will be taken to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the fact that these seemingly very different theories can be treated in parallel stems from the fact that their low energy effective action are formally identical .",
    "i will use a method whose spirit originated in @xcite and which is completely understandable in the framework of non perturbative field theory  la seiberg - witten @xcite .",
    "this will lead to a natural and rigorous proof that the spectra of both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 theories are self - dual when the bare masses are zero .",
    "we will also see how the duality can still work in the massive theories though , as it will be shown , the spectra are no longer in general self - dual _ at a given point _ in the moduli space .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 some generalities on the theories under study",
    "are recalled .",
    "particular emphasis is put on the quantum numbers carried by the solitonic states , as suggested by a semiclassical analysis , and it is explained why they are compatible with an exact duality symmetry . in section 3 , after a short presentation of the seiberg - witten curves whose exactitude will be our unique , very mild hypothesis , some of the physical ideas which are at the basis of the present work are presented .",
    "this leads to a limpid understanding of _ why _ states having any magnetic charges must exist in the theory , and also gives a flavour of what the spectra in the massive cases look like .",
    "it appears that in some regime , the magnetic charge is quantized much as if it were a periodic variable , while only one value of the electric charge is allowed . though the spectrum does not appear in general as being self - dual at a given point in moduli space",
    ", it is argued that it is nevertheless perfectly compatible with an exact s duality of the massive theories .",
    "it is also pointed out that semiclassical reasonings might be able to account for the curious disappearance of all but very few states in some regions of moduli space , a phenomenon first discovered in @xcite at strong coupling . in order to prove the complete sl@xmath15 invariance of the spectra , the consideration of theories with non zero bare @xmath16 angle is needed .",
    "this is done in section 4 .",
    "we also discuss the appearance of superconformal points in some particular theories . in section 5 ,",
    "the uniqueness of the states is proven , as required by duality . in section 6 , a general presentation of the curves of marginal stability , across which the bps spectra may be discontinuous ,",
    "these curves are then used in section 7 to rigorously establish the existence of all the @xmath0 states , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 relatively prime integers , in the massless theories .",
    "finally , in section 8 , a general physical argument is presented which shows that the theories under study must have at least an exact @xmath5 duality symmetry . in particular",
    ", the bps spectra of the _ massless _ theories must be invariant under the monodromy group @xmath5 of the _ massive _ theories .",
    "we then deduce that the vector @xmath6 states exist in the massless @xmath7 theory . in appendix",
    "a , the computation of the seiberg - witten periods is presented , and in appendix b the curves of marginal stability are used to prove the existence of some particular states required by duality in the massive theories .",
    "as already noted in the introduction , one easy way to check whether a given theory may be , or can not be , self - dual , is to look at the quantum numbers carried by the states which are supposed to be transformed into each other by an electric - magnetic rotation .",
    "for example , the w bosons must be the dual of a charged particle having spin one in the one monopole sector .",
    "the very existence of such a spin one solitonic state is already a non trivial test of duality and was proven in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper will be to extend this kind of result to all the electric and magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "in addition to the electric and magnetic charges , there is another abelian quantum number , which we will call the @xmath17 charge , which plays an important r^ ole , since it also appears in the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra and thus in the bps mass formula .",
    "the aim of this section is to explain the relations that may exist between these quantum numbers , and also to discuss the way one should compute the @xmath17 charges .",
    "the theory whose matter content is one @xmath2 adjoint `` quark '' hypermultiplet will be called hereafter the so(3 ) theory .",
    "this matter multiplet consists in two chiral @xmath18 superfields @xmath19 , which correspond in terms of ordinary fields to one dirac spinor @xmath20 and two complex scalars @xmath4 and @xmath21 in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the microscopic lagrangian also contains one yang - mills @xmath2 multiplet ( one vector field @xmath22 , two majorana spinors @xmath23 and @xmath24 and one complex scalar @xmath25 ) .",
    "when the bare mass @xmath11 of the matter multiplet is zero , we recover the @xmath1 theory . when @xmath26 , the moduli space of vacua is a coulomb branch where the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to u(1 ) by a non zero higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath27 . when @xmath12 and @xmath1 , we have other equivalent coulomb branches , permutted by the su(4)@xmath28 symmetry , corresponding to the other scalar fields having a vev .",
    "in addition to the u(1)s associated to the electric @xmath29 and magnetic @xmath30 charges , the theory has an abelian u(1 ) global symmetry @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with corresponding charge @xmath17 .",
    "classically , the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra is @xmath33 where @xmath9 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "semiclassically , the electric charge @xmath29 is @xmath34 , @xmath35 integer , up to terms coming from cp violation ( like a standard witten term proportional to the bare @xmath16 angle ) .",
    "the magnetic charge is given by the dirac quantization condition , @xmath36 for an integer @xmath37 .",
    "we will loosely call in the following the integers @xmath35 and @xmath37 the electric and magnetic charges .",
    "the mass of a bps state @xmath38 will then be @xmath39 for instance , an elementary quark @xmath40 has a tree level mass @xmath41",
    ". the exact quantum formula for @xmath42 can be found .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it can be cast in the form @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the dual variable of @xmath45 and can be , at least in principle , computed very explicitly as a function of a gauge invariant coordinate @xmath46 on the moduli space ( @xmath46 is @xmath47 up to a constant ) @xcite . at the tree level",
    ", we have @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a very convenient combination of the gauge coupling @xmath9 and the theta angle @xmath16 which has a simple transformation law under s duality .",
    "note that @xmath50 is not renormalized since the @xmath8 function is zero .",
    "together with the mass @xmath11 and the coordinate on the moduli space @xmath46 , it is the only parameter in the theory .",
    "the constants @xmath51 in ( [ cc ] ) are only indirectly related to the physical @xmath17 charges @xcite , but can be computed very explicitly , see below .",
    "this theory differs from the preceding one by its matter content .",
    "now we have four @xmath2 hypermultiplets @xmath52 , @xmath53 , transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "we will limit ourselves , for reasons that will become clear in section 3 , to the case where two of these hypermultiplets are massless , say @xmath14 , and the other two have identical masses @xmath13 .",
    "the global non abelian symmetry of the theory is then @xmath54 ( concerning the occurence of the universal cover spin(4 ) of so(4 ) instead of so(4 ) itself for the symmetry associated with the two massless hypermultiplet , see the next subsection ) .",
    "this shows that some states are likely to come in doublets in this theory , as we will see later .",
    "the moduli space of vacua has again a coulomb branch where dyons can exist , in addition to higgs branches which we will not study .",
    "the formula ( [ cccl ] ) is still valid along the coulomb branch , but now we will have in general @xmath55 , @xmath35 integer , instead of @xmath56 , because the gauge group is really su(2 ) and no longer so(3 ) in this theory .",
    "the elementary quarks have @xmath57 for instance .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17 charge will correspond to the transformations @xmath58 , @xmath59 for the quarks @xmath60 and @xmath61 simultaneously .    at a given point on the moduli space of vacua",
    ", the parameters of the theory will be @xmath11 and a generalized unrenormalized gauge coupling @xmath62 .",
    "note the difference between this definition and the corresponding one in the so(3 ) theory .",
    "the advantage of this choices will become apparent in section 3 .",
    "moreover , in order to keep the formula ( [ cc ] ) in the same form in the two theories , we will define here the parameter @xmath45 by @xmath63 .",
    "these different sets of conventions were already used in @xcite and allow to make the formal similarity between the two theories under study very explicit , see section 3 .      from the semiclassical point of view , the solitonic states appear as bound states of a supersymmetric quantum mechanics describing the low energy dynamics of interacting dyons @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables of this supersymmetric quantum mechanics correspond to zero modes of the elementary fields of the quantum field theory . in a @xmath37 monopole configuration , there are @xmath64 real bosonic zero modes .",
    "the four zero modes that are present for all @xmath65 correspond to the center of mass motion ( three modes ) and to the global electric charge ( one periodic mode ) .",
    "the other @xmath66 zero modes describe the relative motions and electric charges . to these bosonic zero modes",
    "are associated some fermionic one . from callias index theorem",
    "@xcite we know that the two adjoint majorana spinors of the @xmath2 vector multiplet will give @xmath67 complex zero modes @xmath68 , @xmath69 , carrying spin @xmath70 .",
    "the other fermionic zero modes come from the matter fermions and differ in the so(3 ) and @xmath7 theory .      there , the adjoint fermions in the matter multiplet will yield @xmath67 additional complex fermionic zero modes @xmath71 .",
    "these zero modes carry spin @xmath70 and @xmath17 charge @xmath72 .",
    "the quantization of the four @xmath73 and @xmath20 fermionic zero modes corresponding to @xmath74 yields to a spectrum of @xmath75 states .",
    "when @xmath12 , this correspond to a full short @xmath1 multiplet .",
    "this shows that monopoles @xmath76 may be the dual of the w bosons . when @xmath77 , there are some additional zero modes .",
    "however it will become clear in the following sections that the @xmath77 stable bound states that exist in the theories under study all have the same quantum numbers as the @xmath76 monopoles ( in some sense , they can be generated by a continuous deformation of the @xmath76 monopoles or of the elementary excitations ) .",
    "this means that for the stable states , the additional zero modes play no rle , and thus we will discard them in the following .    when the mass @xmath11 is set to a non zero value , the @xmath1 multiplet splits into three parts corresponding to states having the same @xmath17 charge and thus the same mass . more precisely , from the sixteen states of the @xmath1 multiplet we get : eight states corresponding to one @xmath2 vector multiplet , which may be the dual to the @xmath2 w bosons @xmath78 ; four states corresponding to one - half of a cpt self conjugate @xmath2 hypermultiplet ( the other half is obtained by quantization in the @xmath79 monopole sector ) , which may be the dual of one component of the adjoint elementary quark , say @xmath80 ; and four states which may be the dual to @xmath81 .",
    "this is summarized in table 1 .",
    "[ states1 ]    .the sixteen states of a @xmath1 multiplet , with their spin and @xmath17 charge .",
    "@xmath82 is the a priori unknown @xmath17 charge of the state @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath2 content of the @xmath1 multiplet is also indicated . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass],[cc ] ) appears , in addition to the electric and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath37 , a term @xmath84 proportional to the mass .",
    "the computation of @xmath51 for each bps state is crucial in order to have quantitative predictions for the physical masses , as we will need in the following .",
    "however , the meaning of the constant @xmath51 is not clear at first sight .",
    "it can not be identified with the physical @xmath17 charge , because the latter has a non trivial dependence on the higgs expectation value due to the spontaneous breaking of cp invariance .",
    "this is , for the @xmath17 charge , a similar effect as the witten phenomenon for the electric charge @xcite , and was discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the non trivial part of the physical @xmath17 charge is actually automatically included in the periods @xmath45 and @xmath44 , and is responsible for the constant shifts these variables can undergo under duality transformations .",
    "this possibility is related to the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath44 are period integrals of a meromorphic one form having poles with non zero residus @xcite , see appendix a. the constants @xmath51 are thus simply a constant part of @xmath17 not already included in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "they can always be determined by consistency considerations , see section 4.4 and the discussion in section 5 .",
    "in this section , some arguments are presented which lead to a clear physical understanding of _ why _ states with any magnetic charges must exist in the theories we are studying , in the context of quantum field theory alone .    we will heavily rely on the seiberg - witten low energy effective action , encoded in the elliptic curve presented in @xcite . thus this section begins with a brief review of this result , emphasizing that it is by now established at a high level of rigour , and above all _ does not _ rely on any duality assumption .",
    "this short survey will also serve to set our notations .      because of @xmath2 supersymmetry , the variables @xmath86 and @xmath45 , which not only completely determine the form of the low energy effective action ( up to two derivatives and four fermion terms ) , but also enter the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass ] ) , must be analytic functions of the gauge invariant coordinate @xmath46 on the coulomb branch @xcite .",
    "these analytic functions have branch cuts and sl@xmath15 monodromies due to singularities caused by charged particles becoming massless for some values of @xmath46 .",
    "the number and type of singularities occuring on the coulomb branch can most easily be found by analyzing the theory in a limit where the mass @xmath11 is very large compared to some scale @xmath87 which represents the dynamically generated scale of the asymptotically free theory we obtain after integrating out the supermassive hyper(s ) .",
    "quantitatively , this limit corresponds to @xmath88 with @xmath89 let us focus for concreteness on the so(3 ) theory . in this regime , and at scales of order @xmath87 , the theory must look like the pure gauge theory , since the ultra - massive quarks must decouple .",
    "the singularity structure of the pure gauge theory was already greatly deduced in @xcite , and it was recently studied at an even higher degree of rigour @xcite .",
    "the result is that , without making any duality assumption , one can prove that we have two singularities at strong coupling whose monodromy matrices are conjugate to @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we must have at scales of order @xmath11 , where a tree level analysis must be valid when @xmath91 , an additional singularity coming from an elementary quark becoming massless .",
    "the monodromy matrix is here again conjugate to @xmath90 , as can be deduced with the help of the @xmath8 function of the low energy theory @xcite , or even directly in the microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "actually , the monodromy transformation for @xmath92 around a singularity at @xmath93 due to a state @xmath94 becoming massless is @xmath95 where @xmath96 searching for an elliptic curve of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a polynomial of degree three , whose moduli space will reproduce the singularity structure described above , is then a fairly simple mathematical exercice .",
    "the solution is unique and given by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 and    @xmath101    the discussion above was for the so(3 ) theory , but as noted in @xcite , the singularity structure and thus the curve is exactly the same in the @xmath102 theory , provided one chooses bare masses @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the matter hypermultiplets , uses the different sets of convention introduced in section 2.1 , and expresses the curve in terms of a dimensionless constant @xmath50 which is @xmath105 only at the tree level but receives one loop as well as non perturbative corrections @xcite . though this useful relation will allow us to study the so(3 ) and the @xmath102 theories in parallel , be careful that it is only a formal one .",
    "for instance , only even , @xmath106-instantons corrections exist in the @xmath102 theory , whereas all @xmath107-instantons contribute in the @xmath108 theory . with our conventions",
    ", these corrections will both be proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "there are also important differences at the level of the spectra .",
    "one of them is that in the so(3 ) theory , a state @xmath110 may correspond to a vector multiplet ( w bosons ) , whereas in the @xmath102 theory the ws are labeled as @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , due to the flavour symmetry , the singularities in the @xmath7 theory are produced by su(2 ) doublets of hypermultiplets becoming massless .",
    "the general form of the monodromy matrices ( [ monomat ] ) remains valid since if the solution for the periods is noted @xmath112 for the so(3 ) theory , it will be @xmath113 for the @xmath7 theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 appearing in ( [ curve ] ) is a good gauge invariant coordinate on the coulomb branch , which is related to the physical expectation value @xmath114 by a formula of the form @xmath115 the @xmath116 correspond to instanton corrections @xcite .",
    "we conventionally extracted the combination @xmath117 because it tends towards the physical parameter @xmath118 under the renormalization group flow towards the pure gauge theory or the @xmath119 massless theory ( [ rg ] ) .",
    "the transformation properties of the parameters @xmath120 of the theories under s duality can easily be read from the curve ( [ curve ] ) . under a general sl@xmath15 transformation given by a matrix @xmath121",
    "we have @xmath122 the fact that these strong - weak coupling transformations can be coherently implemented on the curve ( [ curve ] ) is already a non - trivial evidence that the theories may be self - dual @xcite .",
    "below , we will investigate the transformation properties of the variables @xmath86 and @xmath45 ( or equivalently of the electric @xmath123 and magnetic @xmath124 charges ) .",
    "this will give rise to predictions on the bps spectra .",
    "checking that these predictions are indeed true will be the main goal of the forecoming sections .      in the remainder of section 3",
    ", we will set the bare @xmath16 angle to zero .",
    "the very interesting physics associated with the possibility of having a varying real part in @xmath50 will be considered in section 4 .",
    "to guess what the analytic structure ( position of the singularities and of the branch cuts ) looks like , it is simplest to choose the parameters so that we are not far away from the pure gauge theory ( or massless @xmath125 ) , where we easily control what is going on . at strong coupling",
    ", we have two singularities on the real axis , at points @xmath126 and @xmath127 such that @xmath128 , with an analytic structure already worked out in @xcite .",
    "moreover , at weak coupling , we have a quark becoming massless at @xmath129 , with the following asymptotics for @xmath86 and @xmath45 : @xmath130 the exact location of the singularities @xmath131 can be found by setting the discriminant of the curve ( [ curve ] ) to zero , @xmath132    [ figure1 ] = 14.7 cm    we have @xmath133 .",
    "we choose the position of the branch cut for the logarithm appearing in the asymptotics ( [ asympq ] ) in such a way that it does not disturb the analytic structure of the pure gauge theory .",
    "this is the most natural choice , since the existence of a singularity at a scale @xmath134 can not influence the physics at scale @xmath87 . in figure 1",
    "are also indicated the quantum numbers of the particles becoming massless .",
    "note that due to a `` democracy '' between the dyons @xcite , the most general choices for the electric and magnetic charges of these states are @xmath135 where @xmath136 corresponds to the singularity @xmath137 and @xmath35 is any integer .",
    "our choice is @xmath138 .",
    "note also that due to the cuts , the particle becoming massless at @xmath126 is described by two different sets of integers , @xmath139 or @xmath140 , depending on whether one looks from the @xmath141 or @xmath142 half - plane .",
    "this shows that one must introduce two different monodromy matrices at @xmath126 , @xmath143 the other monodromy matrices are @xmath144 it is now possible to study the transformation properties of @xmath112 ( or equivalently of @xmath145 ) under duality .",
    "the naive guess would be that @xmath92 transforms exactly according to the corresponding sl@xmath15 matrix @xmath146 acting on the parameters of the microscopic theory as in ( [ dualt ] ) .",
    "however , we will see that this is not true in general .",
    "we must introduce an sl@xmath15 matrix @xmath147 which acts on the low energy effective action ( i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) while @xmath146 acts on the microscopic parameters .",
    "this subtlelty stems from the fact that the monodromy group associated with the curve ( [ curve ] ) is @xmath5 , the subgroup of sl@xmath15 consisting in the matrices congruent to the identity modulo 2 .",
    "the only straightforward and correct statement that can be done is thus that @xmath148 mod 2 .",
    "moreover , in the massive theories , @xmath44 and @xmath45 can also pick up some constants under a duality transformation .",
    "this is allowed by the form of the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass],[cc ] ) , since a shift in @xmath44 or ( and ) @xmath45 can be reabsorbed in a shift of @xmath51 .",
    "a very similar and related phenomenon occurs when one is studying the duality transformations of the low energy theory @xcite , but one must keep in mind that by now we are studying duality transformations of the whole , microscopic , theory .",
    "let us be more concrete .",
    "what we want to deduce is a formula relating the dual theory solution characterised by the parameters @xmath149 given by ( [ dualt ] ) and whose periods are @xmath150 to the original solution described by @xmath151 .",
    "let us focuss in this section on the transformation @xmath152 .",
    "the analytic structure of @xmath153 can be readily deduced from the one of @xmath112 depicted in figure 1 . indeed , as @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the effect of the duality transformation will simply be to exchange the singularities at @xmath129 and @xmath126 while the singularity at @xmath127 remains fixed .",
    "the dual theory thus has singularities at exactly the same points as the original theory ( a direct consequence of the self - duality of the curve ( [ curve ] ) ) , but the quantum numbers of the states becoming massless at a given point , as well as the position of the branch cuts , are changed , see figure 2 .",
    "[ figure2 ] = 14.7 cm    this is enough to deduce that @xmath157 the shifts by @xmath158 come from the fact that a dyon is exchanged with a quark , and these two states have different @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the s duality transformation does not simply exchange @xmath45 and @xmath44 ( up to a sign , and up to the shifts ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the state becoming massless at @xmath159 is @xmath160 in both formulations , and this state is not self - dual ( is not an eigenvector of s ) .",
    "second , to eliminate the cut between @xmath159 and @xmath161 in the dual formulation ( and thus recover the same structure for the cuts as in the original formulation ) , it is necessary to perform an sl@xmath15 transformation , given on one side of the cut by the monodromy @xmath162 .",
    "this also explains why the transformation law depends on the sign of @xmath163 .",

    "these names deserve some comments . in any case",
    ", one should keep in mind that the bare gauge coupling of the whole ( finite ) theory is very large in the limit ( [ rgdual ] ) .",
    "thus , by strong or weak coupling , we only refer to the effective coupling which governs the low energy physics .",
    "moreover , even in @xmath220 for instance , the effective theory may be strongly coupled ( it is near @xmath159 since there a magnetically charged particle is massless ) .",
    "the point is that the regions in @xmath220 where the coupling is strong can always be joined to other regions in @xmath220 where the coupling is weak , the dyon spectrum remaining unchanged .",
    "indeed , the _ electric _ effective coupling is zero at @xmath161 where the quark is massless .",
    "this suggests that the bps spectrum might be probed in the vicinity of @xmath161 by using standard , `` semiclassical , '' approximation schemes , since we do have in this region a small parameter in the original , `` electric , '' theory . actually , if duality is correct ( and we will prove that its predictions indeed are concerning the dyon spectrum ) , the physics should be the same in the weakly coupled region surrounding @xmath161 in figure 4 as in the strongly coupled region surrounding @xmath185 in figure 3 , and we should be able to account for the `` strong coupling '' jumps of the bps spectrum seen in @xcite by using such methods . however , we will not try to do that here .",

    "however , the states @xmath264 have a mass of order @xmath11 , whereas the states @xmath224 are likely to have a mass of order @xmath87 in the region surrounding the singularities @xmath127 and @xmath129 we are considering . since in the rg flow ,",
    "@xmath182 while @xmath87 is fixed , the decays are impossible and the curves of marginal stability simply indicate that the inverse decay reaction from a @xmath264 to a @xmath224 state is possible .",
    "one might put forward the fact that states having @xmath264 but arbitrarily high electric and magnetic charges could have a mass of order @xmath87 due to a subtle compensation of the terms @xmath265 and @xmath266 in the bps mass formula .",
    "however such fine tuning , which is indeed possible , can only occur for some very special values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 and in some very special and small regions in the @xmath46-plane .",
    "nothing prevents us to avoid these special points and to cross the curve of marginal stability nearby , where the @xmath264 state again have a mass of order @xmath11 .",
    "i wish here to point out that , though we have considered the possibility of these `` fine tuning '' points , they are very likely to be unphysical . indeed",
    ", if states producing these `` fine tuning '' points would exist , the theory would not have a well defined field theory limit under the ( dual ) rg flow .",
    "we have thus obtained the following results : states with any magnetic charges , dual to the dyons @xmath267 , indeed exist , with the correct multiplicities .",
    "thus , though the positions of the branch cuts are completely different in the original and in the dual theories , the deduced spectra are perfectly compatible with duality .",
    "however , we have not yet proven that the states corresponding to @xmath268 are really present ; we simply know that they may be",
    ". this point will be investigated in appendix b.",
    "in the preceding section , we have shown using simple arguments that stable states having any magnetic charge , which are required by s duality , indeed exist .",
    "we were studying theories with non zero bare masses , but it is very tempting to think that these states can be continuously deformed while remaining stable when @xmath269 and thus are at the origin of the existence of states having any magnetic charge in the massless theories as well .",
    "however , we will not obtain in this process all the states required by duality in the massless theories .",
    "for instance in the so(3 ) ( @xmath1 ) theory s duality implies the existence of all the states @xmath201 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 relatively prime . up to now",
    ", we only have the states @xmath270 with @xmath271 , and it is not difficult to realize in the context of the semiclassical approach @xcite that once you have one of these states , then you will also have all the other states @xmath272 , for any integer @xmath212 .",
    "actually , the missing states should come from configurations where states having any @xmath35 and @xmath37 relatively prime are massless at the singularities .",
    "the fact that such configurations must exist is clearly a necessary condition for the self - duality of the theories , and does not follow straightforwardly from the sl@xmath15 invariance of the curve ( [ curve ] ) .",
    "we saw above that for any imaginary value of @xmath50 ( @xmath273 ) , the singularities are produced by states having @xmath274 or @xmath275 alone .",
    "one must then study cases where @xmath276 and find a mechanism to understand how the quantum numbers at the singularities can change .",
    "this is similar to a phenomenon which is known to occur for instance in the massive su(2 ) asymptotically free theories , where semiclassical quarks must `` transmute '' into monopoles in order to account for the singularity structure at strong coupling @xcite . however , there can be an important difference between this kind of transmutation and the one we will see at work below",
    ". we will realize that two kinds of transmutations can occur . in the first kind",
    ", the quantum numbers of the state are changed according to a matrix of the form ( 8) .",
    "we will see in the next subsections that this is the only kind of transmutation that can occur in the theories under study in this paper , because singularities in the moduli space never coincide , see ( [ singpos ] ) . in the second kind of transmutation",
    ", the state transforms according to a matrix which is not of the form ( 8) ( note that , in any case , there are many of them , since the matrices ( 8) are all conjugate to some power of @xmath277 ) .",
    "these transmutations of the second kind are directly related to the necessity for two ( or more ) singularities to coincide for some special values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "these special points are known to lead to superconformal theories @xcite .",
    "let us come back to our problem .",
    "we will soon show that the quantum numbers at the singularities can only be changed by matrices belonging to the _ monodromy _ group @xmath278 ( in the cases under study , we will see that any matrix of @xmath279 can be generated ) .",
    "it is also clear that a necessary condition for the theories to be self - dual is that any state , related to the original states becoming massless by a _ duality _ group transformation , must become massless for some value of the coupling .",
    "if the @xmath136 denote the electric and magnetic quantum numbers of the particles becoming massless in the original configuration , we see that the theory can be self - dual only if @xmath280 where @xmath281 denotes the _ duality _ group . for our purposes , @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "we thus have to check whether any @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 relatively prime , can be generated by acting with a @xmath5 matrix on one of the three states @xmath209 , @xmath160 or @xmath286 .",
    "this is indeed true because sl@xmath287 and that @xmath288 is generated by three transpositions whose corresponding matrices ( already described mod 2 in section 2.2.2 ) can be chosen in order to map a `` fundamental '' state , say @xmath110 , exactly into the three states @xmath110 , @xmath160 and @xmath286 we have at our disposal .      let us start from a configuration , characterized by a certain value of the bare coupling @xmath290 and of the bare mass @xmath11 , and whose analytic structure is of the same type as the one described in figure 1 .",
    "we will allow the monodromy matrices @xmath291 to be of the most general form , provided they satisfy the fundamental consistency conditions @xmath292 to these monodromy matrices correspond states becoming massless , characterized by their electric and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath293 and @xmath51-charge @xmath294 .",
    "note that ( [ consistency ] ) implies via ( [ monomat ] ) , amongst other relations of the same type , @xmath295 actually , as we will only consider configurations which are sl@xmath15 transforms of the original one depicted in figure 1 , sl@xmath15 symplectic invariant relations can be checked or deduced using @xmath296 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",

    "we will not repeat this argument here , but we will rather introduce another idea , which is maybe more heuristic , but has the merit of showing that the structure of the low energy effective action can imply the _ equivalence _ of theories related by some transformations of the monodromy group .",
    "we will elaborate more on this kind of argument in section 8 .",
    "the point is that by sweeping up the @xmath46 plane with the branch cut originating at @xmath161 , as shown in figure 6 , we can generate the transformation : would generate @xmath315 which is equivalent to @xmath316 due to the relations ( [ consistency ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath317    [ figure6 ] = 14.7 cm    doing this on the original configuration of figure 1 is innocent since it will generate a trivial @xmath318 transformation , which is interpreted as an unphysical relabelling of the electric quantum numbers @xmath35 .",

    "this also shows that the physical interpretation of the parameter @xmath50 is no longer the same after analytic continuation : if we choose to still use @xmath50 even after the @xmath16 angle shift , the real part of @xmath50 clearly will no longer be @xmath321 ( or @xmath322 ) .",

    "of course , the physical interpretation of @xmath50 in the two equivalent theories will not be the same .",
    "similar remarks also apply to @xmath46 . to close this discussion , note that the ambiguity in the interpretation of @xmath50 we deal with in this subsection is related to the fact already mentioned in subsection 3.2 that the sl@xmath323 matrix @xmath147 which acts on @xmath112 coincides with the sl@xmath15 matrix @xmath146 which acts on @xmath50 and @xmath46 , _ only up to monodromy transformations .",

    "we are thus able to obtain any matrix of the subgroup of sl@xmath15 generated by @xmath334 and @xmath331 .",

    ", i will briefly discuss below some relations with other approaches .",
    "let me first explain how our line of reasoning can shed light on some aspects of the semiclassical quantization .",
    "i will illustrate this point on the following example .",
    "it is well known in the context of the semiclassical approach @xcite that the existence of dyon - monopole bound states with @xmath343 in the pure @xmath2 gauge theory would violate the self - duality of the @xmath1 theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that such bound states are in one to one correspondence with the cohomology classes of _ holomorphic _ differentials on the reduced ( @xmath66 dimensional ) multimonopole moduli space in the case of the pure gauge theory , while the differentials only need to be harmonic in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that any @xmath343 bound state of the pure gauge theory corresponds to @xmath344 bound states in the @xmath1 theory , the second state corresponding to the antiholomorphic partner of the original holomorphic differential form .",
    "this is in contradiction with @xmath17 duality which predicts the existence of one and only one bound state of given @xmath35 and @xmath37 . from our point of view",
    ", this seemingly purely technical relation between the two theories comes from the fact that they can be joined together by continuously varying the bare mass and the coupling and using the renormalization group flow .",
    "stable states in the pure gauge theory will then yield stable states in the @xmath1 theory , by continuous deformation .",
    "moreover , we do not want any additional @xmath343 state in the @xmath1 theory coming from the pure gauge theory , since we know that such states originate from the existence of dual pure gauge theories configurations .",
    "i wish now to point out one surprising aspect of our derivation , and trace its profound origin in superstring dualities .",
    "all our reasoning is based on a careful study of the low energy effective action of the theories . though it is well known that the latter contains a lot of information about the _ massive _ states ( encoded in the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass ] ) ) in the context of @xmath2 supersymmetric theories",
    ", it might seem astonishing that it also governs the _ formation _ of all the stable bound states ( coming in short multiplets ) .",
    "nevertheless , this fact , which appears for the first time in @xcite , is supported by increasing evidence .",
    "i hope that the present paper will convince the reader that it is both understandable ( if not natural ) and quite general in the field theory framework .",
    "however , a deeper understanding of this phenomenon comes from string theory .",
    "there , in the framework of the heterotic - type ii duality conjecture @xcite , you can argue that the bps states of @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theories correspond to a self - dual non - critical string in six dimensions wrapped along geodesics around the corresponding seiberg - wittern curve @xcite .",
    "the metric on the curve is directly related to a particular seiberg - witten differential , which can in principle be computed unambiguously .",
    "as all these geometric data are contained in the low energy effective action , we understand why it completely determines the bps spectrum . in the case of @xmath1 , the low energy theory as well as",
    "the metric are trivial and the self - duality of the spectrum follows easily @xcite from the assumption that the type iib string gives rise to the @xmath1 gauge theory in some limit .",
    "the cases of some su(2 ) theories , including also very recently the so(3 ) theory studied in this paper , were addressed in @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath7 should also be within the stringy approach capabilities .",
    "our results thus constitute non trivial tests of the string - string duality hypothesis .",
    "we will mainly focus in this section on the @xmath1 theory , in order to avoid tiresome repetitions . in subsection 5.3",
    ", we will nevertheless briefly point out the peculiarities of the @xmath7 theory , which do not yield any new difficulties .      as there is only _",
    "one _ multiplet in the hilbert space of states corresponding to the fundamental @xmath1 multiplet @xmath110 , s duality predicts the existence of only _",
    "one _ @xmath1 multiplet @xmath0 .",
    "as indicated in the table 1 of section 2 , such an @xmath1 multiplet can be decomposed into three parts characterized by their physical s charges @xmath82 , @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "when @xmath12 , we can use cp invariance to show that the existence of a state having @xmath17 implies the existence of another state having @xmath347 , and that in a given monopole sector @xmath348 , @xmath349 .",
    "angle does not influence the physical @xmath17 charge @xcite . ]",
    "uniqueness of the @xmath0 state would therefore imply that @xmath350 , and the three values of @xmath17 that should be realized correspond to the cp invariant combination @xmath351 .",
    "state in the semiclassical picture must be self - dual or anti self - dual . ]",
    "the extremal values @xmath352 and @xmath353 correspond to states belonging to a @xmath2 hypermultiplet , while @xmath354 corresponds to a @xmath2 vector multiplet .",
    "the @xmath0 states we have generated in section 4 in the massive theory correspond to @xmath2 hypermultiplets , having a given charge @xmath355 . because of @xmath1 supersymmetry in the @xmath269 limit , these hypermultiplets will be associated to other states to form whole @xmath1 multiplets @xmath356 or @xmath357 .",
    "the physical @xmath17 charges of a state @xmath358 must be related to the constants @xmath51 appearing in the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra by a relation of the form @xcite @xmath359 where @xmath360 . to determine @xmath361",
    ", one can proceed as follows . when @xmath12 , the solution for @xmath86 and @xmath45 is given by @xmath362 where @xmath363 is the sign of @xmath163 .",
    "the ( unphysical ) cut for @xmath86 comes from the choice we did in section 3 for the position of the branch cut originating at @xmath129 when @xmath364 .",
    "when @xmath364 , we will have @xmath365 however , if @xmath366 , the physical @xmath17 charge contributes to @xmath86 and @xmath45 , even at infinity , by an amount determined by @xmath361 in such a way that @xmath367 @xmath361 can then be computed straightforwardly by using the formulas for @xmath86 and @xmath45 given in appendix a. one must note , however , that the sign of @xmath361 remains arbitrary , since it can be changed by performing a weyl gauge transformation .",
    "this is related to the fact that one can choose equivalently @xmath368 or @xmath369 to be massless at @xmath129 in the configuration of figure 1 .",
    "the convention we will choose hereafter is the following : @xmath368 will be chosen to be massless at @xmath129 when @xmath370 and @xmath369 when @xmath371 ( we will only consider real values of @xmath11 ) .",
    "these conventions will allow us to use the gauge invariance in a convenient way . finally , we have @xmath372 where @xmath373 is the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "this formula implies in particular that the dyons found in section 3 by studying the dual rg flow ( [ rgdual ] ) all have @xmath374 as expected .",
    "it is not disturbing that @xmath17 may undergo a discontinuity from @xmath375 to @xmath376 .",
    "this discontinuity simply reflects the ambiguity associated with cp invariance when @xmath46 or @xmath377 are real .    to be concrete",
    ", we will hereafter consider a particular configuration , obtained from the original configuration depicted in figure 1 by performing the transformation @xmath378 ( see section 4 ) , and which is described in figure 7 .",
    "this amounts to changing @xmath86 into @xmath379 and @xmath45 into @xmath380 .",
    "[ figure7 ] = 14.7 cm    this choice is completely arbitrary : _ all our reasonings will be sl@xmath15 invariant and thus completely general .",
    "_ however , we think that it is more eloquent to deal with states having magnetic charges three , four or seven than simply one , for in this latter case unicity of the states is trivial from the semiclassical point of view .",
    "we already know that the @xmath1 multiplet corresponding to a state @xmath381 becoming massles is unique since the singularities are produced by only one hypermultiplet .",
    "thus , what we need to show is that , for instance , the only allowed values of @xmath51 for a state @xmath382 should be @xmath383 ( charge of the hypermultiplet becoming massless ) together with @xmath384 and @xmath385 ( this would correspond to the case where the physical @xmath17 charge of @xmath386 would be @xmath72 ) or with @xmath387 and @xmath353 ( when @xmath388 ) .",
    "suppose that a state @xmath389 exists in the @xmath1 theory .",
    "when a real mass @xmath11 is turned on , @xmath389 must produce a singularity at any point on the coulomb branch where it is massless , that is where @xmath390 which in the original variables reads @xmath391 to study this equation , at least in the large @xmath392 limit , one can use the asymptotics ( [ limite ] ) for @xmath45 at large @xmath393 .",
    "this suggest that ( [ uni1 ] ) might have solutions only when @xmath394 when @xmath370 and only when @xmath395 when @xmath371 at points @xmath396 more rigorously , using ( [ cptrans ] ) and the monodromy @xmath316 , one can show that @xmath397 for @xmath398 .",
    "moreover , one can easily show using the explicit formulas of @xmath45 and its derivative @xmath399 given in appendix a that , in the case @xmath370 , @xmath45 is a monotonically increasing function for @xmath400 , with @xmath401 ( this latter value is reached at @xmath402 ) , and @xmath403 when @xmath404 .",
    "strictly similar results are true when @xmath371 , which proves that the simple analysis using the asymptotics is valid except concerning @xmath405 , as one may have expected .",
    "as the @xmath406 exist for any @xmath370 when @xmath407 and for any @xmath371 when @xmath408 , a singularity must be associated in the massive theories to any state @xmath389 existing in the massless one , provided @xmath407 ( if @xmath370 ) or @xmath408 ( if @xmath371 ) . from this we deduce that when @xmath370 , which corresponds to the case depicted in figure 7 , the state becoming massless at @xmath161 , having @xmath409 , must have a physical @xmath17 charge @xmath72 ( it is thus associated with states having @xmath405 and @xmath410 when @xmath12 ) , and that no other @xmath389 state having @xmath411 can exist when @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath371 , the state becoming massless at @xmath161 will have @xmath410 and @xmath388 multiplet ( see table 1 in section 2 ) which becomes massless is changed when @xmath11 changes sign with our conventions . ] and we see that no other @xmath389 state having @xmath412 can exist when @xmath12 .",
    "this proves the unicity .",
    "exactly the same reasoning can be applied to the states @xmath413 .",
    "the equation to study is in this case @xmath414 by using again ( [ limite ] ) , we can convince ourselves , and then show rigorously , that when @xmath142 ( [ uni2 ] ) will have solutions when @xmath415 ( for @xmath370 ) or when @xmath411 ( for @xmath371 ) .",
    "this is again perfectly consistent with our previous analysis of the @xmath51 and @xmath17 charges . when @xmath370 , it is the state having @xmath388 which is massless , and we showed that no state @xmath416 with @xmath417 can exist ; when @xmath371 it is the state having @xmath418 which is massless , and we showed that no state with @xmath419 can exist .",
    "thus the @xmath1 multiplet @xmath416 is indeed unique and realizes the values @xmath388 , @xmath354 and @xmath420 as it should .",
    "finally , note that the case of the states @xmath421 and @xmath422 can be easily handled for instance by using the previous results and the @xmath176 type duality transformation ( [ periodstrans ] ) , or by repeating the same analysis as above .",
    "of course , the reasoning will not change whatever configuration of the theory you may choose , and thus we have proven the unicity of the states @xmath0 for any @xmath3 and @xmath4 relatively prime .      in this theory ,",
    "the solution is given by @xmath423 and @xmath424 , and the bare masses of the first and second flavours are equal to @xmath425 .",
    "the uniqueness of the @xmath0 states can then be proven exactly as for the @xmath1 theory .",
    "in particular , a @xmath426 hypermultiplet becoming massless when @xmath364 will again be associated to two other sets of states having physical charges @xmath427 and @xmath428 , or @xmath429 and @xmath430 when @xmath12 , the spin(8 ) flavour symmetry playing the same rle in this theory as @xmath1 supersymmetry in the previous case .",
    "the main novelty is that one also has to study the uniqueness of the vector @xmath6 states .",
    "again one can repeat the arguments of the preceding subsection .",
    "equation ( [ uni1 ] ) will be replaced by @xmath431 from the analysis of the preceding subsection it follows that this equation has solutions for any @xmath51 such that @xmath432 .",
    "moreover , by using the formula for @xmath45 given in appendix a , one can show that @xmath433 when @xmath434 and thus the equation ( [ uni3 ] ) will also have solutions for @xmath435 at least for some values of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the only @xmath6 states , @xmath436 mod 2 , that might exist in the @xmath12 theory must have @xmath354 , as expected .",
    "the same reasoning works for the state @xmath6 such that @xmath437 mod 2 .",
    "however , when @xmath438 mod 2 , one can not exclude directly the states having a physical @xmath17 charge @xmath439 .",
    "this seems to be a peculiarity of the vector particles : at fixed @xmath50 , these vector particles , if they existed , would not necessarily lead to an unphysical singularity , and hence their existence can not be ruled out by this argument alone .",
    "of course , this is not really an obstacle for us . by changing @xmath50 to @xmath440 in the original configuration , we exchange @xmath185 and @xmath159 and thus states @xmath437 mod 2 with states @xmath438 mod 2 , and we can then deduce that necessarily @xmath354 for the latter states .    to prove the unicity",
    ", we still have to check whether only one state exists at given @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath51 . the argument which worked for the @xmath0 states relied on the fact that any of these states can be related to a singularity appearing on the coulomb branch for some values of the coupling , and that we know the multiplicity of the states producing singularities .",
    "this clearly does not work for the @xmath6 states , which are never massless ( when @xmath364 ) and thus never produce a singularity . as an alternative",
    ", we will rely on a semiclassical analysis . in @xcite",
    "was shown that the states @xmath6 indeed exist and are unique _ for @xmath441 .",
    "_ the uniqueness of the @xmath442 states for _ any _ @xmath3 and @xmath4 relatively prime will then follow from the @xmath5 invariance of the theory , see section 8 .",
    "due to the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass ] ) , a bps state is generically stable .",
    "central charge as well as mass conservation indeed impose tights constraints . to see this ,",
    "suppose that a bps state of central charge @xmath42 decay into @xmath3 states of central charges @xmath443 .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath444 and @xmath445 of the @xmath3 relations ( [ cms1 ] ) , only @xmath446 are independent once one takes into account ( [ firstc ] ) , and thus they define a hypersurface of real codimension @xmath446 included in the coulomb branch . in our case where the gauge group is of rank one and thus the coulomb branch of real dimension two , this means that decays into two distinct particles can only occur along real curves , decays into three distinct particles at special points , and decays into four or more distinct particles are likely to be impossible .",
    "suppose we are studying the decay of a state @xmath447 into two states , one of them being @xmath448 . instead of using the original variables @xmath449 , it is convenient to use shifted variables @xmath450 such that @xmath183 .",
    "the equation for the curve of marginal stability can then be cast in the following sl@xmath15 invariant form : @xmath451 the left hand side of ( [ cmseq ] ) does not depend on the final state @xmath448 , and the right hand side is an a priori arbitrary rational number which we will denote by @xmath452 .",
    "we thus see that to a given particle @xmath447 is associated a whole family of curves of marginal stability , @xmath453 , indexed by a rational number @xmath452 .",
    "it is useful at this stage to summarize what we need to show in order to complete our goal , which is to demonstrate that the spectrum of bps states is in perfect agreement with @xmath17 duality both in the @xmath1 and massless @xmath102 theory , and also to prove the existence of the required states in the massive cases studied in section 3 .",
    "+  we need to show that the states @xmath0 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are relatively prime integers , which we have generated by analytic continuation in the _ massive _ theories ( section 4 ) , still exist in the _ massless _ one .",

    "+  we need to show that the states @xmath6 exist in the @xmath102 theory , since they represent the duals of the w bosons in this case .",
    "we did not give any argument in favour of the existence of such states up to now , since they are not associated with any singularity on the coulomb branch .",
    "however , one can establish their existence by using the general argument presented in section 8 , _ and _ by relying on the non trivial semiclassical results obtained in @xcite for states of magnetic charge 2 .",
    "+  finally , we need to show that the dual of the w bosons ( and of the elementary quarks in the @xmath102 theory ) does exist in the dual theory studied in section 3.5 .",
    "there it was only shown that the existence of these states does not lead to any inconsistency .",
    "actually , these dual states exist in the massless theories , and in appendix b we will explain why they must still exist when the bare mass is increased and we follow the rg flow ( [ rgdual ] ) toward the dual pure gauge ( or massless @xmath119 ) theory .",
    "let us end this section by mentioning the formula @xmath454 which corresponds to a cp transformation . note that though this is _ not _ a duality transformation",
    ", it is still perfectly compatible with the bps mass formula ( [ bpsmass ] ) .",
    "this relation is useful to study the symmetries and some particular points of the curves of marginal stability .",
    "in this section , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two relatively prime integers .    in section 4 , strong evidence in favour of the existence of the states @xmath0 in the massless theories",
    "was given : depending on the value of the coupling @xmath50 , when the bare mass is turned on , the singularities on the coulomb branch may be due to any of these states .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the existence of the states was proven only when @xmath364 and @xmath455 .",
    "when @xmath12 and the singularities merge at @xmath456 , all the @xmath0 states become massless and thus degenerate in mass .",
    "though a brutal discontinuity in the spectrum between @xmath364 and @xmath12 seems very unlikely on physical grounds , we would like to argue that the @xmath0 states not only exist at the singularities they are responsible for , but also at other points in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "one way of doing this is to consider a configuration where the @xmath0 state becomes massless , and to study the family of curves of marginal stability associated with the decay of this state .",
    "if @xmath436 mod 2 , we have a family @xmath457 defined by ( cf ( [ cmseq ] ) ) @xmath458 and if @xmath438 mod 2 we have a family @xmath459 , @xmath460 the case of @xmath437 mod 2 is completely similar to the case @xmath436 mod 2 due to ( [ periodstrans ] ) .",
    "we have computed the curves @xmath461 numerically , using the analytic formulas for the periods presented in appendix a , and the result is depicted in figure 8 .",

    "first , let us consider a theory with only one singularity on the coulomb branch .",
    "it could be the massless theories studied above .",

    "a branch cut , _ while keeping all the parameters fixed , _ we show that necessarily two theories connected by the transformation @xmath166 must be physically equivalent .",
    "this kind of argument was already presented in subsection 4.3 . in the case of @xmath1 or @xmath2 with four massless flavours , @xmath472 and",
    "the `` duality '' transformation is nothing but a gauge transformation .",

    "two scenarios can be imagined in this case . in the first one , for some reasons the naive arguments are true , and",
    "thus the monodromy group generated by @xmath334 and @xmath473 corresponds to an exact duality symmetry . in the second scenario ,",
    "the two singularities combine : we choose the branch cut originating at @xmath161 to go through @xmath185 and then to coincide with the branch cut originating at @xmath185 . far away from the singularities ,",
    "we thus only see a branch cut associated with a monodromy matrix @xmath475 which is the product of the two matrices @xmath316 and @xmath476 .",
    "of course the position of this branch cut extending to infinity can be chosen arbitrarily , and thus an exact duality symmetry must be associated with @xmath477 , at least when @xmath478 . in the case of the pure gauge theory ,",
    "@xmath475 expresses the asymptotic freedom and is associated with the invariance of the theory under @xmath16 angle shifts .",
    "finally , let us study the case where three singularities @xmath137 are present on the coulomb branch , with monodromy matrices @xmath291 .",
    "the theory may now have one , two , or three intrinsic scales , corresponding to the distances @xmath479 between the singularities . in the @xmath2 theory with one flavour of quark , we have three singularities at equal distances from each other because of a @xmath480 symmetry acting on the coulomb branch @xcite .",
    "thus we have only one scale @xmath87 at our disposal . the same scenario as the one which prevailed for the pure gauge theory occurs , and we do not have any particular duality symmetry in this theory .",
    "now , the finite theories we are studying in this paper also have three singularities in the coulomb branch , but with the most important property that two independent scales can be introduced and _ any one of the three singularities can be chosen to be arbitrarily far from the other two . _",
    "typically , we are studying a dual rg flow as in ( [ rgdual ] ) , and two of the three singularities ( say @xmath161 and @xmath185 ) are separated by an almost fixed distance @xmath481 while the third singularity ( @xmath159 ) runs to infinity with @xmath11 at a distance @xmath482 , where @xmath11 is the bare mass in the theory .",
    "in such a configuration , as in the case where only two singularities are present , we can not know a priori whether the monodromies @xmath316 and @xmath476 associated with the singularities at scale @xmath87 will correspond to an exact duality symmetry . however , the situation is different for the isolated singularity at scale @xmath11 .",
    "the latter can only be `` screened '' by the singularities at scale @xmath87 .",
    "we think that this is impossible , because it seems very unlikely that the low energy physics at scale @xmath87 could be influenced by a singularity at scale @xmath11 , produced by a particle which is ultra massive at scale @xmath87 ( if it exists ) , and vice - versa .",
    "one might argue that the branch cuts of the three singularities could merge at a new intrinsic scale @xmath483 .",
    "however , the physical origin of this new scale would be very unclear and we will rule out this possibility .",
    "we thus see that the only natural way to interpret the singularity structure is to admit that @xmath311 corresponds to an exact duality symmetry of the theory at least in the configuration where @xmath484 and @xmath485 with @xmath486 . from the point of view of the massless theory , which corresponds to @xmath487",
    ", we have thus an invariance with respect to @xmath311 .",
    "the rle of the three singularities can of course be exchanged due to the sl@xmath15 invariance of the seiberg - witten curve ( [ curve ] ) , and we deduce that the @xmath12 theories have an exact duality group which contains @xmath5 .    in particular , the existence of all the @xmath6 states in the @xmath7 theory will then follow from the existence of the three states @xmath111 ( the w ) , @xmath488 and @xmath489 , which were shown to exist in @xcite using the semiclassical method .",
    "in this paper , we proved rigorously that all the @xmath0 dyon states , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are relatively prime integers , exist in the @xmath1 as well as in the @xmath2 , @xmath7 gauge theories with gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "these states were obtained by analytic continuation of the @xmath490 states which become massless at some points of the coulomb branch when the bare @xmath16 angle is zero . in the process of analytic continuation",
    ", we saw explicitly that the quantum numbers at the singularities can change according to a monodromy transformation .",
    "we also proved the unicity of the dyon states , in perfect agreement with an exact sl@xmath15 duality symmetry .",
    "we also provided a very general physical argument showing that @xmath1 and @xmath2 with four massless flavours must have an exact duality symmetry group which contains the monodromy group of the corresponding massive theories .",
    "this fact together with already known semiclassical results implies the existence of all the @xmath6 vector states in the @xmath7 theory .",
    "the line of reasoning used in this work , particularly the arguments of subsections 4.1 and 8 , is likely to be generalizable to theories having any gauge group , for instance to the case of su(n ) with @xmath491 .",
    "this may answer the open questions in these cases @xcite .    from a very general point of view",

    ", these geodesics must begin and end at the branching points @xmath499 ( see ( [ roots ] ) in appendix a ) .",
    "a link between the two points of view is the following : it is clearly impossible to have a non - null geodesic with the required properties for a state @xmath496 satisfying ( [ conc1 ] ) , since the geodesic would have zero length and this requires its endpoints to coincide , that is to have a singularity . more important",
    ", the existence of a particular point @xmath46 such that ( [ conc1 ] ) is true is likely to prevent the existence of the corresponding geodesic for `` any '' @xmath46 , by continuity . of course subtleties",
    "are associated with the curves of marginal stability , and the vector particles may have a particular status .",
    "in any case , we believe that a complete understanding of the relationship between the two approaches is likely to provide a deeper understanding of @xmath2 theories . it is a pleasure to thank adel bilal for his permanent encouragements and many interesting discussions .",

    "actually , the same general formulas can be used to evaluate the periods of the asymptotically free theories having @xmath500 as well @xcite .",

    "note also that the ambiguity that exists in the definition of @xmath518 , which stems from the fact that @xmath523 is a doubly periodic , even function of @xmath524 , can be absorbed in a redefinition of @xmath509 by using legendre s relation @xmath525 and the fact that @xmath526 for any integers @xmath527 and @xmath528 .",
    "it should be clear that such integrals can only appear in theories with non zero bare masses , since it is only here that jumps in @xmath86 and @xmath45 are allowed @xcite .",

    "this is done in subsection 5.3 .",
    "the solution is then given in 5.4 .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath530 is nothing but the modular parameter of the torus ( [ curve ] ) , and would thus naively be given by @xmath531 .",
    "however , this formula is a priori valid only modulo sl@xmath15 transformations , and some additional constraints must be found from physics .",
    "the first constraint comes from the evaluation of @xmath530 in the limit @xmath404 where it should coincide with @xmath50 , modulo @xmath16 angle redefinitions which correspond to trivial shifts of the electric charge .",
    "this constraint is indeed satisfied with our choices for the homology cycles @xmath532 and @xmath533 .",
    "the second constraint comes from the analytic structure of @xmath530 as a function of @xmath46 , which was described in section 3 in the case of a trivial bare @xmath16 angle .",
    "this analytic structure is most easily studied when one uses the explicit formulas @xmath534 and @xmath535 where the @xmath137 correspond to the positions of the singularities ( [ singpos ] ) .",
    "we then obtain a unique solution , given when @xmath273 by @xmath536 @xmath537 and @xmath399 are also very directly related to the fundamental periods @xmath538 and @xmath539 . before writing explicit formulas",

    "[ figure10 ] = 14.7 cm    in this appendix , we complete the proof of section 3 and show that the spectrum of the dual pure gauge theory ( or dual @xmath125 massless theory ) is in perfect agreement with duality . in section 3 , we already showed that the duals of the @xmath275 monopoles indeed exist outside the curve of marginal stability @xmath562 represented in figure 4 in the theory @xmath177 .",
    "in addition to these states , duality predicts the existence of the duals of the w bosons , and also of the elementary quarks in the case of the @xmath7 theory .",
    "more precisely , we need to prove that in the so(3 ) theory the state @xmath563 indeed exists for @xmath141 outside the curve @xmath562 or equivalently that @xmath564 exists for @xmath142 . in the @xmath7 theory , in addition to the preceding state ( now interpreted as being the dual of the quarks of the massless @xmath125 theory ) , we must have the @xmath565 ( or @xmath566 ) state interpreted as being the dual of the w.    our strategy will be the following : as we already know that all these states exist when @xmath12 , we will simply show that they can not decay outside the curve @xmath562 when the mass is turned on and we follow the rg flow ( [ rgdual ] ) toward the dual pure gauge ( or @xmath125 ) theory . to do this , remark first that the family of curves of marginal stability associated with @xmath563 coincides with the one for @xmath565 , and that the family for @xmath567 is the symmetric of the family for @xmath563 with respect to the real @xmath46 axis .",

    "as argued in section 7 , we will consider only @xmath569 such that @xmath571 and thus @xmath572 or @xmath573 where @xmath107 is any integer .",
    "the corresponding curves are represented in figure b.1 . as there is no curve outside @xmath562 in the lower half - plane , the state @xmath563 ( or @xmath565 ) can not decay in this region .",
