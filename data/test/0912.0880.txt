    "it has been realised over the past decade that the black hole at the centre of a galaxy bulge is no mere ornament but plays a major role in determining the final stellar mass of the galaxy . the process by which this occurs is known as cosmic feedback and it takes place through an interaction between the energy and radiation generated by accretion onto the massive black hole and the gas in the host galaxy .",
    "the ratio of the size of the black hole to that of the galaxy is huge and similar to a person in comparison to the earth , so the details of the feedback process are complex .",
    "the overall picture in terms of energetics is fairly straightforward and two major modes have been identified .",
    "the first is the _ radiative _ mode , also known as the quasar or wind mode , which operates , or operated , in a typical bulge when the accreting black hole was close to the eddington limit .",
    "the second mode is the _",
    "kinetic _ mode , also known as the radio or jet mode .",
    "this typically operates when the galaxy has a hot halo ( or is at the centre of a group or cluster of galaxies ) and the accreting black hole has powerful jets .",
    "it tends to occur at a lower eddington fraction and in the more massive galaxies .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that the growth of the central black hole by accretion can have a profound effect on its host galaxy .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of the galaxy is @xmath1 then the binding energy of the galaxy , which is of mass @xmath2 is @xmath3 .",
    "the mass of the black hole @xmath4 ( tremaine et al 2002 , hring & rix 2004 ) . assuming a radiative efficiency for the accretion process of 10% , then the energy released by the growth of the black hole @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath6 for a galaxy @xmath7 so @xmath8 .",
    "fortunately accretion energy does not significantly affect the stars of the host galaxy , or there would not be any galaxies .",
    "the energy and momentum from accretion do couple with the gas .",
    "the processes involved in that are reviewed here .",
    "silk & rees ( 1998 , see also haehnelt et al 1998 ) point out that a quasar at the eddington limit can prevent accretion into a galaxy at the maximum possible rate ( equivalent to its gas content going into free fall at a rate @xmath9 , so power needed is @xmath10 ) provided that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the thomson cross section for electron scattering and @xmath13 is the fraction of the galaxy mass in gas .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to be isothermal with radius @xmath14 , so that its mass is @xmath15 the argument is based on energy balance .",
    "momentum balance gives an expression ( fabian 1999 , fabian et al 2002 , king 2003 , 2005 , murray et al 2005 ) @xmath16 which is about @xmath17 times larger and more in line with the observed @xmath0 relation for @xmath18 .",
    "there are several ways to derive the above formula . a simple one is to assume that the radiation pressure from the eddington - limited quasar has swept the gas , of mass @xmath19 to the edge of the galaxy .",
    "balancing forces gives @xmath20 i.e. @xmath21 from which the result follows .",
    "the interaction can not rely on radiation pressure on electrons as in the standard eddington - limit formula , since if the quasar is locally at its eddington limit then it must be far below the eddington limit when the mass of the galaxy is included .",
    "( quasars appear to respect the eddington limit , see e.g. kollmeier 2006 . )",
    "the interaction has to be much stronger , either through a wind generated close to the quasar which then flows through the galaxy pushing the gas out , or to dust in the gas , as expected for the interstellar medium of a galaxy ( laor & draine 1993 , scoville & norman 1995 , murray et al 2005 ) .",
    "dust grains embedded in the gas will be partially charged in the energetic environment of a quasar which will link them to the surrounding partially - ionized gas .",
    "@xmath22 is reduced by a factor of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the equivalent dust cross section per proton , appropriately weighted for the dust content of the gas and the spectrum of the quasar .     of dusty gas required for a given effective eddington ratio @xmath25 .",
    "a quasar spectrum and galactic dust fraction is assumed , giving @xmath26 the result for a typical agn operating at @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "a value of 500 is adopted in the text .",
    ", width=268 ]    we find that @xmath23 is about 500 for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio ( fabian et al 2008 ) .",
    "this means that a quasar at the standard eddington limit ( for ionized gas ) is at the effective eddington limit ( for dusty gas ) , @xmath29 of a surrounding object 500 times more massive ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "is this just a coincidence or the underlying reason why @xmath30 ?    ) plane .",
    "dust lanes can occur at large radii at low columns .",
    "the 3 curves indicate different dust to gas ratios relative to the galactic value . on the right",
    "is the plane populated by the swift - bat agn .",
    "the dashed curve is for @xmath22 appropriate for a region of twice the black hole mass expected at a radius of few pc ( fabian et al 2009 ) .",
    "the single point in the forbidden region is a galaxy with an outflowing warm absorber.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] ) plane .",
    "dust lanes can occur at large radii at low columns .",
    "the 3 curves indicate different dust to gas ratios relative to the galactic value . on the right",
    "is the plane populated by the swift - bat agn .",
    "the dashed curve is for @xmath22 appropriate for a region of twice the black hole mass expected at a radius of few pc ( fabian et al 2009 ) .",
    "the single point in the forbidden region is a galaxy with an outflowing warm absorber.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    we have investigated ( fabian et al 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ) whether there are indications of @xmath31 in agn by examining the plane of absorption column density , @xmath32 versus eddington fraction , @xmath33 . most intrinsic cold absorption seen in x - ray spectra originates fairly close to the nucleus ( the required gas mass would otherwise be prohibitive ) .",
    "therefore an agn with @xmath34 is highly sub - eddington for local ionized dust - free gas , but effectively at the eddington limit for dusty gas clouds which are optically thin to dust absorption .",
    "the outer parts of larger optically - thick clouds act as dead weight which increases @xmath35 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the net result is that there should be a forbidden zone in the ( @xmath36 ) plane to the right of the @xmath35 curve .",
    "this is indeed what we see ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "at low column densities there can be absorption from an outer disc or dust lane , so we ignore the region below about @xmath37 .",
    "the observed points show that agn do indeed influence the amount of gas in a galaxy bulge .",
    "the way that gas can evolve on the ( @xmath36 ) plane is that gas which strays into the forbidden zone is pushed outward , reducing @xmath38 as it does so in a shell , sliding along the curve .",
    "gas which is introduced to a galaxy can stay , fuelling both the black hole and star formation , provided both @xmath31 and @xmath22 remain below unity .",
    "repitition of this process should drive @xmath39 . at higher redshifts where the metallicity and dust content was less ,",
    "then this ratio should be proportionately higher .",
    "studies of the ( @xmath40 ) plane at higher redshifts and with large samples may show us how the gas content of galaxies responds and evolves to the action of quasars .",
    "if the repeated action of radiation pressure on dust is responsible for the @xmath0 relation then it must cause the bulge mass @xmath41 or @xmath42 feedback should shape both the black hole and the galaxy bulge and may even lead to the fundamental plane .",
    "if the main interaction is due to winds , not to radiation pressure , then the wind needs to have a high column density , high velocity @xmath43 , high covering fraction @xmath13 , all at large radius @xmath14 .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of a wind is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gravitational radius @xmath46 and @xmath47 to produce @xmath48 scaling the thrust of the wind needs to correspond to the eddington limit ( the wind may need to be dusty ) .",
    "warm absorbers flowing at @xmath49 are insufficient ( blustin et al 2005 ) .",
    "bal quasars flowing at tens of thousands @xmath50 may however be important ( see article in these proceedings by n. arav ) .",
    "the more massive galaxies at the centres of groups and clusters are often surrounded by gas with a radiative cooling time short enough that a cooling flow should be taking place .",
    "the mass cooling rates would be tens , hundreds or even thousands of @xmath51 .",
    "such objects should be significantly growing their stellar mass now , yet they are not .",
    "this is because the massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy is feeding energy back into its surroundings at a rate balancing the loss of energy through cooling ( for reviews see peterson & fabian 2006 , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 , cattaneo et al 2009 ) .",
    "several steps in this feedback process are clearly seen in x - ray and radio observations .",
    "the accretion flow onto the black hole generates powerful jets which inflate bubbles of relativistic plasma either side of the nucleus .",
    "the bubbles are buoyant in the intracluster or intragroup medium , separating and rising as a new bubble forms , if the jet operates more or less continuously ( churazov et al 2001 ) .",
    "this is seen to be the case since a study of the brightest 55 clusters ( fig .  4 ;",
    "dunn et al 2006 ; see also rafferty et al 2006 ) shows that over 70% of those clusters where the cooling time is less than 3  gyr , which need heat , have bubbles , and another 20% have a central radio source .     of energy surrounding each inner bubble , where @xmath52 is the volume of the radio - plasma filled interior ( fabian et al 2006 ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]   of energy surrounding each inner bubble , where @xmath52 is the volume of the radio - plasma filled interior ( fabian et al 2006 ) .",
    "right : unsharp masked image showing the pressure ripples or sound waves .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=235 ]    the kinetic power in the jets can be estimated from the size of the bubbles , the surrounding pressure ( obtained from the density and temperature of the thermal gas ) and the buoyancy time ( which depends on the gravitational potential ) .",
    "the power is high and only weakly correlated with radio power ( the radiative efficiency of many jets is very low at between @xmath53 ) .",
    "the power is usually in good agreement with the energy loss by x - radiation from the short - cooling - time region .",
    "the overall energetics of the feedback process are therefore not an issue .    in the case of the perseus cluster , which is the x - ray brightest in the sky ,",
    "chandra imaging shows concentric ripples which we interpret as sound waves generated by the expansion of the central pressure peaks associated with the repetitive blowing of bubbles ( fabian et al 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "the energy flux in the sound waves is comparable to that required to offset cooling , showing that this is the likely way in which heat is distributed in a quasi - spherical manner .",
    "similar sound waves , or weak shocks , are also seen in the virgo , centaurus and a2052 clusters and in simulations ( ruszkowski et al 2004 ; sijacki & springel 2006 ) .",
    "let us now consider how the apparent close heating / cooling balance has been established and maintained .",
    "the lack of high star formation rates suggests that cooling does not exceed heating by ten per cent or so .",
    "the presence of central abundance gradients and pronounced temperature drops indicates that heating does not general exceed cooling by that much either .",
    "this balance needs to continue over tens to hundreds of bubbling cycles ( each of a 1050  myr or so ) .",
    "a simple 1d feedback cycle seems at first sight possible .",
    "if too much gas starts to cool then the accretion rate should increase making the heating rate go up and vice versa .",
    "however the time scales involved are long , meaning that feedback would be delayed and angular momentum could prevent gas reaching anywhere near the black hole .    studying the details requires the best data on the brightest nearby objects .",
    "x - ray images from chandra and moderate resolution spectra from the xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) show x - ray cool gas in some clusters cores , with temperatures ranging from 5 to 0.5  kev in the nearby centaurus cluster ( sanders et al 2007 ) .",
    "the coolest gas has a cooling time of only 10  myr , yet the spectra show no sign of any lower gas temperature gas ( where ovii emission is expected ) . in this object",
    "the heating / cooling balance looks to hold to a few per cent . how the 0.5  kev gas is prevented from cooling",
    "is not obvious .",
    "the images show that it is clumpy so the question arises as to how it is targetted for heating without its immediate surroundings being overheated .",
    "a similar picture emerges from several other clusters with excellent data .",
    "one solution is that the tight balance is only apparent .",
    "if the jets become too energetic then can they push through the whole cooling region ( e.g. cyg a or ms0735.6 + 7421 ; mcnamara et al 2009 ) and deposit energy much further out .",
    "if cooling dominates then it can feed the reservoir of cold gas seen in many objects , as well as some star formation . the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) at the centre of a1835 at @xmath54 is an extreme example with over @xmath55 of massive star formation ( odea et al 2008 ) .",
    "it is within a factor of two of the highest star formation rate of any galaxy at low redshift ( arp 220 ) .",
    "( without heating , the central intracluster gas in a1835 would be cooling at over @xmath56 , so a balance remains , but not a very tight one . )",
    "reservoir compared with spitzer ir luminosity ( odea et al 2008 ) . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]   reservoir compared with spitzer ir luminosity ( odea et al 2008 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    many bcgs in _ cool core _",
    "clusters ( the ones with the short radiative cooling times ) have extensive optical emission - line nebulosities ( e.g. crawford et al 1999 ) .",
    "the cold gas is mostly molecular as shown by co ( edge 2001 ) and h@xmath57 emission .",
    "ngc1275 at the centre of the perseus cluster is a spectacular example ( fig .",
    "6 ) with its filaments being composed of about @xmath58 of h@xmath57 ( salom et al 2006 ) . star formation happens sporadically in that galaxy with @xmath59 occurring over the past @xmath60 in the se blue loop ( canning et al 2009 ) .",
    "dust is seen in the form of dust lanes and infrared emission , with spitzer observations revealing high ir luminosities ( egami et al 2006 , odea et al 2008 , fig .",
    "6 ) . the dust is presumably injected by stars into the central cold gas reservoir , from where the bubbles drag gas out to form filaments .",
    "much of this ir luminosity is due to vigorous star formation in the bcg , presumably fuelled by a residual cooling flow .",
    "some however could be due to the coolest x - ray emitting clumps , at 0.51  kev , mixing in with the cold gas and thereby cooling non - radiatively ( fabian et al 2002 ; soker et al 2004 ) .",
    "the outer filaments in ngc1275 , may be powered by the hot gas ( ferland et al 2009 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that gas may be cooling from the hot phase of the intracluster medium at a higher rate than otherwise thought .",
    "some of the cooling occurs non - radiatively by mixing .",
    "the gas then hangs around for gyrs as a reservoir of cold molecular dust clouds , forming stars slowly and sporadically .",
    "generally the central agn in bcgs is quite sub - eddington ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the luminous low redshift quasar h1821 + 643 at @xmath62 is a counter - example ( russell et al 2009 ) .",
    "the surrounding gas however seems to be in the same state as for normal cool core bcgs .",
    "an active nucleus interacts with the gas in its host galaxy through radiation pressure , winds and jets .",
    "the consequences can be profound for the final mass of the stellar component of the galaxy as well as the black hole .",
    "the radiative or wind mode was most active when the agn was a young quasar . at that stage",
    "the galaxy had a large gaseous component and the nucleus was highly obscured .",
    "direct observational progress is therefore difficult and slow .",
    "the kinetic mode on the other hand is more easily observed , albeit at x - ray and radio wavelengths , since it is acting now in nearby objects and the surrounding gas is highly ionized .",
    "an attractive possibility is that the radiative mode shaped the overall galaxy and black hole mass at early times and the kinetic mode has since maintained that situation where needed ( churazov et al 2006 ) .",
