    "positronium , an electron - positron bound state , is a particularly simple system which offers unique opportunities for testing our understanding of bound - states in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "because its constituents are much lighter ( by a factor of about 200 ) than any other known charged particles ( muons or pions ) , the spectrum and lifetimes of positronium states can be understood with very high precision within an effective theory of electrons and photons .",
    "comparison of theoretical predictions with experiments constrains a variety of new physics phenomena , such as axions , millicharged particles , paraphotons , etc .",
    "in addition , the opportunity of testing the predictions with high accuracy stimulates development of theoretical tools which can also be applied in other areas of physics , such as qcd .",
    "this talk gives an elementary introduction to basic properties of positronium , reviews some recent improvements in their theoretical description , and briefly touches upon implications for new physics searches .",
    "positronium ( ps ) is an atom resembling hydrogen in many respects .",
    "to first approximation its mass differs from the sum of its constituents masses ( @xmath0 mev ) by the small binding energy , e_b = -m_e ^2 4 - 6.8 ev , which is about half that of hydrogen , because the reduced mass in positronium is @xmath1 .",
    "the ground state and its radial excitations form the so - called gross spectrum , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this picture , based on the non - relativistic schrdinger equation , has to be corrected for relativistic effects . in this talk",
    "we will be concerned entirely with the lowest radial state with zero angular momentum ( @xmath4 wave ) .",
    "it comes in two varieties , depending on the sum of spins of the electron and positron : para - positronium ( p - ps ) with total spin 0 , and ortho - positronium ( o - ps ) , which is a triplet with total spin 1 .",
    "p - ps is slightly lighter , due to the spin - spin interaction .",
    "this difference of masses , called the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) , offers one of the most accurate tests of bound - state theory based on qed .",
    "( for a review of other precisely measured energy intervals in ps see @xcite . )     + ( a ) ( b ) +    the origin of hfs can be best explained with the lowest - order diagrams contributing to this effect , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lowesthfs ] .",
    "they represent two types of interactions : direct and annihilation .",
    "these two effects together give the following difference of energy levels of o - ps and p - ps ( that difference is conventionally expressed in terms of the corresponding frequency @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we will often use @xmath6 to denote the energy intervals ) : ^(0 ) = ( ) ^d + ( ) ^a . the direct interaction diagram [ fig : lowesthfs](a ) represents a magnetic photon exchange which induces a spin - dependent potential v_m = -4m_e^2q^2 [ _ i , q ] [ _ i, q ] , where un - primed and primed @xmath7-matrices act on the electron and positron spinors , respectively .",
    "the difference of expectation values of this potential in o - ps and p - ps states gives ( ) ^d = m_e^4 3 .",
    "the annihilation contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowesthfs](b ) ) shifts only the o - ps energy and we can evaluate it directly from the product of amplitudes of o - ps becoming a photon and of the reverse process . projection on the triplet state can be obtained by taking the trace with the o - ps spin wave function , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the o - ps polarization vector ( @xmath10 ) : ( ) ^a & = & -4(2m_e)^2 |(0)|^2 ( ^ ) ^2 + & = & m_e^44 .",
    "@xmath11 is the square of the ps wave function at the origin and @xmath12 denotes the electron ( or positron ) four - momentum , in which we neglect the spatial components at this level of accuracy ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "adding the two contributions , we find the lowest - order hfs : ^(0 ) = ( ) ^d + ( ) ^a = 7m_e^412 204387 .",
    "[ eq : zerohfs ] this result was obtained in @xcite .",
    "present experimental accuracy requires computing one- and two - loop corrections to this formula .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) +   + ( d ) ( e ) +    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the last column indicates the value of the two - loop coefficient @xmath14 necessary to reconcile a given central experimental value with the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : otheor ] ) .",
    "we see that the most precise ann arbor experiments require an anomalously large value of @xmath14 .",
    "this has been known as the `` o - ps lifetime puzzle . ''",
    "more recent tokyo results , which are at present somewhat less accurate , are in good agreement with the qed prediction with a much smaller @xmath14 .",
    "a new experiment is underway at tokyo , and the data collected so far are in agreement @xcite with the previous result @xcite .",
    "this ongoing effort is expected to provide a measurement of @xmath15 with an accuracy of about 150 ppm , somewhat better than the presently available ann arbor results .",
    "concerning a possible large value of @xmath14 , it should be mentioned that the perturbative coefficients are moderate in qed predictions for other observables studied with high accuracy , such as leptonic anomalous magnetic moments ( @xmath16 ) , or various spectroscopic properties of positronium and muonium .",
    "if there are exceptions , they are caused by widely separated energy scales , such as the electron and muon masses in the muon @xmath16 . in the ps lifetime",
    "such effects arise as logarithms of @xmath17 and have already been accounted for in the leading order .",
    "it has also been argued that the smallness of the complete two - loop non - logarithmic effects in p - ps , which have recently been calculated @xcite , indicates that analogous two - loop effects in o - ps are unlikely to explain the large discrepancy with experiment .",
    "however , this issue remains controversial and can only be clarified by an explicit calculation of @xmath14 , and renewed experimental studies of @xmath18 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the sensitivity of ps decays and hfs measurements to various kinds of new physics . here",
    "we focus on the example of millicharged particles ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the millicharged particles we are interested in here are fermions , similar in properties to the electron , but with an unknown small mass @xmath19 and electric charge @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is electron s charge and @xmath22 ) .",
    "such particles were searched for in decays of o - ps @xcite , where a 90% confidence level upper bound @xmath23 was found for @xmath24 ( this bound is not very sensitive to @xmath19 , except for @xmath19 close to @xmath25 , where it becomes weaker ) . that bound was found by comparing a theoretical prediction for the decay rate of o - ps into a pair @xmath26 of millicharged particles , ( x|x ) = ^2 m_e^66 ( 1+m_x^22m_e^2 ) , with the measured bound on the maximum decay rate of o - ps into invisible particles , @xmath27 .    how does this compare with the sensitivity of hfs to possible extra loops in the photonic vacuum polarization ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloophfs](c ) ) ?",
    "we find that a pair of millicharged particles would have a negative contribution to ps hfs , given by the formula ( millicharged ) & = & ^2 m_e^512 + & & \\ { 13 + 2 ( 1+m_x^22m_e^2 ) } + & & -^2 m_e^3 ^ 515m_x^2 .",
    "we note that the o - ps decay search for @xmath26 has the advantage that the standard model background ( o - ps@xmath28 ) is suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , with presently achievable experimental accuracy , hfs can not compete with o - ps if @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "for this reason we have displayed the simple limiting behavior of the hfs contribution for large @xmath19 .",
    "another potentially interesting observable which might be sensitive to @xmath26 effects is the electron anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "if @xmath31 , the contribution of an @xmath26 loop is a_e(millicharged ) = ^2 ^ 2 m_e^245 ^ 2 m_x^2 .",
    "[ eq : ae ] we can now express the millicharged pair contribution to the hfs by its effect on @xmath32 : ( millicharged ) & = & -3m_e^3 a_e(millicharged ) + & = & -367 ^(0)a_e(millicharged ) , where @xmath33 denotes the lowest order ps hfs , given in ( [ eq : zerohfs ] ) . in the lowest order in @xmath17 we have @xmath34 , so that = -187 a_e(millicharged ) a_e^(0 ) .",
    "since the present agreement of theory and experiment for @xmath32 is at the level of 3 parts in @xmath35 @xcite , we see that the largest compatible effect of millicharged particles in hfs could be of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "this is insufficient to reconcile the theory with experiment since , as we saw in section [ sec : spectrum ] , the observed hfs value is smaller than the theoretical prediction by about 3 mhz , or @xmath37 .",
    "it might , however , be worth noting that the differences of central theoretical and experimental values of @xmath32 and ps hfs have opposite signs , and an @xmath26 pair would decrease both discrepancies .",
    "positronium decays were also used to search for light pseudoscalar bosons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that such searches give much more stringent constraints on the coupling of pseudoscalars to electrons than do present hfs measurements ( by a few orders of magnitude ) .",
    "if pseudoscalars are heavier than o - ps , the relative sensitivity of @xmath32 and ps hfs to such particles was discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed the basic properties of the positronium spectrum and decay modes .",
    "we have seen that there are discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and experimental determinations of the hyperfine splitting ( by 3.3@xmath7 ) and o - ps lifetime ( by about @xmath38 for ann arbor experiments ) .",
    "it is unlikely that new physics effects are responsible for such large differences .",
    "it is also very unlikely that the uncalculated higher - order effects in qed could alone account for such discrepancies .",
    "most likely , both problems could be clarified by new experiments .",
    "while efforts are underway to obtain a more accurate value of the o - ps lifetime , it would also be very useful to re - measure the hyperfine splitting .",
    "i am grateful to s. asai for helpful discussions on o - ps lifetime measurements , to s. davidson and w. marciano for careful reading of the manuscript and helpful remarks , and to k. melnikov and a. yelkhovsky for collaboration on positronium physics .",
    "i thank professor andrzej biaas and professor micha praszaowicz for inviting me to the cracow school of theoretical physics .",
