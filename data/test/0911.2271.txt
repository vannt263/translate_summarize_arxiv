    "at the time when giant planets form , the mass ( 99% ) of the protoplanetary disk is dominated by gas .",
    "dust is a minor constituent of the mass of the disk .",
    "still , it dominates the opacity ; consequently , it is much easier to observe .",
    "therefore , most of the observational constraints of disks have been deduced from the study of dust emission ( e.g. , see chapter by henning et al . ) .",

    "dust signatures are strongly related to dust size . in particular , as soon a dust particle reaches a size close to a decimeter it becomes practically `` invisible '' . for example , a crucial quantity such as the disk dissipation time scale is normally deduced from the decline of the fraction of the sources presenting near - ir ( jhkl ) excess in clusters of increasing ages ( e.g. , haisch et al .",

    "the observational study of the gas in the inner disk is a relatively new emerging topic . only with the advent of ground - based high - spectral resolution infrared spectrographs and space - born infrared spectrographs",
    "has this research become possible .",
    "the main tool used to study the gas in the disk is molecular spectroscopy .",
    "the gas in the disk is heated by collisions with dust , shocks or uv or x - rays from the central star .",
    "the heated molecules populate different rotational and vibrational levels and when they de - excite emission lines are produced .",
    "the key is that these emission lines have the imprint of the physical conditions of the gas where they originated .",
    "important constraints can be derived from emission lines : ( i ) line ratios of different transitions constrain the excitation mechanism ( shocks , uv or x - rays ) and the temperature of the gas responsible of the emission ; ( ii ) if the emitting gas is optically thin , then the measured line fluxes are proportionally related to the amount of molecules present ; therefore , line fluxes can be used to derive column densities and gas masses ; ( iii ) line shapes and spatial extended provide constraints on the size and geometry of emitting region as well as the dynamics of the emitting gas .",

    "an important element that one should always bear in mind when studying molecular emission from disks is the region where the emission observed is produced . as the disk has a radial and vertical temperature and density gradient ( hotter closer to the star and higher in the disk , denser closer to the star and deeper in the disk )",

    "i will follow a discussion inspired by the historical development of the field .      properly speaking h@xmath5 in emission ( 6590  ) from young stars does not trace the gas in the disk . however , since h@xmath5 emission is one of the primary indicators of accretion of gas from the disk onto the star ( e.g. , hartmann et al . 1994 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "1998b ) , h@xmath5 is a robust indicator of a gaseous disk .",
    "in particular , when any other gas tracer fails , h@xmath5 emission tells us unambiguously that there is gas .",
    "its main advantages are : ( i ) it is easy to observe ( a small telescope with a medium resolution r@xmath23000 spectrograph can do it ) ; ( ii ) it is a robust diagnostic ; ( iii ) it can be studied in large samples of objects of diverse brightness in relatively short time .",
    "its main limitations are : ( i ) it does not provide information on the physical conditions of the gas in the disk ( h@xmath5 tells us that there is gas and allows us to deduce the accretion rate , but not much more ) ; ( ii ) if the accretion rate is below 10@xmath6m@xmath7/yr , h@xmath5 in emission is too weak to be observed ; ( iii ) in low resolution spectra of late type stars ( k and later ) , h@xmath5 in emission from accretion can be confused with h@xmath5 due to stellar activity ( typically a line width higher than 100 km / s is required for inferring accretion ) .",
    "h@xmath5 in emission allowed us to confirm that very low mass stars have disks , that relatively old objects still have gaseous disks , and that several transition disks still have gas in their inner disks ( e.g. , sicilia - aguilar et al .",

    "the co band - head emission is characterized by a broad feature at 2.3 @xmath9 m .",
    "its particular shape can be modeled by the convolution of @xmath11=2 - 0 co ro - vibrational emission lines at rest with the double peaked line profile characteristic of emission from a disk .",
    "the main advantages of this diagnostic are : ( i ) it can be studied with a low resolution near - ir spectrographs and ( ii ) it traces the innermost part of the disk .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the densities and temperatures require to be very high to produce the emission .",
    "this is the main reason for why this line has been observed towards only a hand - full of objects .",

    "progress in the sensitivity of millimeter radio telescopes led to the detection in the early 90 s of pure rotational emission ( @xmath12 ) from cold co from t tauri stars ( e.g. , weintraub et al .",

    "millimeter interferometry observations of co permitted to settle the controversy about the existence of circumstellar disks around these objects .",

    "these not trivial characteristics had allowed the survey of relatively large samples of young stars with disks ( e.g. , dent et al .",
    "2005 , andrews & williams 2005 ) , and have permitted the spatially resolved study of the disk structure in several objects ( e.g. , pitu et al .",
    "the main limitation of co emission and other gas tracers in the ( sub)-mm is that they trace the cold gas in the outer part of the disk ( r@xmath120 au ) .",

    "nonetheless , most of the mass of the disk is located in the cold outer part of the disk .",
    "co emission in the ( sub)-mm has important limitations as tracer of gas mass : ( i ) cold co is expected to freeze - out onto dust grain surfaces at low temperatures ( t@xmath020 k ) and high densities ( n@xmath14 @xmath15 ) ; therefore , co is expected to be depleted ; ( ii ) co emission can be optically thick .",
    "both limitations introduce a large uncertainty on the conversion factor ( up to a 1000 ) between the co observed and the real amount of h@xmath3 present in the outer disk .",
    "typically , the ism co / h@xmath3 conversion factor of 10@xmath16 is used .",
    "however , this value is most likely incorrect for disks .",
    "the large uncertainty in the determination of mass of gas affects seriously the empirical estimation of the gas - to - dust ratio .",

    "are widely spaced in energy ( for example the first energy level starts at 510 k ) .",
    "that means that a dedicated observation is required for each h@xmath3 line in order to construct rotational diagrams ( note that in contrast , co lines are closely spaced and several lines are observable within one observation set up ) . moreover , since h@xmath3 emission is produced in warm t@xmath22 k gas , h@xmath3 emission can also originate from shocked gas in outflows and not in the disk ( note that historically h@xmath3 emission has been used to trace shocks ) . finally , the mid - ir region is a challenging window to perform high - sensitivity observations from the ground .",

    "optically thin lte models of the observed lines revealed excitation temperatures @xmath2700 k and an oh emitting region extending up to 1 au .",

    "the study of simple organic molecules in the near and mid - ir is growing .",
    "the main advantage of these diagnostics are : ( i ) they trace the gas in the terrestrial planet forming region of the disks , and ( ii ) they have the potential of constraining the chemical processes in this region . from the observational point of view ,",
    "an additional advantage is that within a single observation set - up , multiple tracers are observable simultaneously .",
    "in addition , the fact that some of the lines are observable from the ground at 3 @xmath9 m open the door to the study of a large number of objects at high spectral and spatial resolution .    one limitation of these gas tracers is that the interpretation of the observations generally requires complex modeling that involves : ( i ) assumptions in the structure of the inner disk ; ( ii ) poorly constrained physical quantities ( e.g. , the uv field , inclination of the inner disk ) ; and ( iii ) poorly constrained physical processes ( e.g. , excitation mechanisms , chemistry , radial and vertical mixing in the disk ) . on the other hand",
    ", these limitations can become an advantage , because , even if observations can be interpreted with different models , observations can also rule out scenarios that are not consistent with the measurements .",
    "it is interesting that future observations of simple molecules in the inner disk could reveal a variety of disk chemistry until now unsuspected .",
    "finally , note that in very short time spitzer will not offer mid - ir spectroscopy anymore .",
    "however , future mid - ir spectrograph miri planned for jwst will be an ideal tool for this research .",
    "in this contribution i have discussed several observational diagnostics that allow to study the gas in protoplanetary disks highlighting the strengths and limitation of each diagnostic . here ,",
    "i summarize important general points that one should bear in mind about observational constraints of gas in disks .",
    "* disks have a radial temperature structure ; therefore , different gas diagnostics are employed for probing different regions of the disk .",
    "uv probes the hottest gas in the innermost disk ( r@xmath331 au , t@xmath12000 k ) , nir and mir probes hot and warm gas in the inner disk ( r@xmath20.1 - 20 au , t@xmath2100 - 2000 k ) , ( sub)-mm probes cold gas in the outer disk ( r@xmath49 au , t@xmath220 - 100 k ) .",
    "note that disks have typical sizes of several hundreds of au . * to observe a line from gas ( in emission or absorption ) the dust in the medium where the line is produced must be optically thin at the observed wavelength , or the gas should be at a higher temperature than the dust . *",
    "an optically thick disk has a vertical temperature structure .",
    "the surface layer is hotter than the interior mid - plane layer .",
    "the dust in the surface layer is optically thin , the dust in the interior layer ( of the inner disk ) is optically thick . in optically thick disks , hot and warm gas emission lines from the uv to the ir are produced in the surface layer .",
    "note that the amount of mass in the surface layer is much smaller than the amount of mass in the interior layer .",
    "gas lines in the ir probe only a limited amount of material .",
    "h@xmath3 lines in the ir are optically thin .",
    "co lines in the ir can be optically thick .",
    "* sub - mm lines trace only the cold outer regions of the disk at r@xmath120 au .",
    "planets usually are not expected to form at this distances .",
    "still , most of the mass of the disk is at r@xmath120 au .",
    "* co in the ( sub)-mm is not a reliable disk gas mass tracer because ( i ) co freezes onto dust grain surfaces , ( ii ) the co / h@xmath3 conversion factor is unknown in disks ( iii ) the emission is likely optically thick . *",
    "be aware that so far we do not measure directly the mass of gas in disks .",
    "we deduce the disk mass from dust continuum emission in the ( sub)-mm from cold dust in the outer disk ( r@xmath120 au ) .",
    "the deduced mass depends on the dust opacity , dust temperature and the dust - to - gas ratio assumed .",
    "the disk mass observed is from material located at r@xmath150 au , and disk evolutionary models are typically of disks of r@xmath050 au .",
    "the mass and surface density profiles of gas at r@xmath020 au are poorly constrained from observations . *",
    "modeling is required to interprete line observations .",
    "conventional assumptions are that the observed gas is at lte and is optically thin .",
    "the rotational diagrams employed for deducing the temperature of the observed gas make use those two assumptions .",
    "to deduce the inner most radius of the observed emission ( i.e. , r@xmath17 ) from line profile modeling , it is required to assume the disk inclination and the dependence of the intensity as a function of radius ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "inclinations are typically deduced from ( sub)-mm imaging and extended to the inner disk . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to deduce independently the inclination ( e.g. , to search for evidence of warps ) we need to assume ( or calculate ) r@xmath17 and @xmath50 . *",
    "most of the gas tracers ( e.g. , h@xmath3 , [ ne ii ] ) can be produced by shocked emission from outflows as well .",
    "high spectral / spatial resolution is required for determine whether the emission is observed at the velocity of the central star and whether it is spatially extended or not .",
    "* gas emission could be excited by collisions with dust grains , shocks and uv or x - rays .",
    "line ratios are generally employed to discriminate between the different excitation mechanisms .",
    "* gas could be present in a disk even when dust emission is weak or not present .",
    "gas emission lines have been observed in the inner regions of transitional disks and in several wtts . *",
    "the study of gas in disks acquired momentum with the advent of high - resolution ground ir spectrographs and high - sensitivity ir spectrographs in space . * a new chapter in gas studies",
    "was recently written with the detection of emission of simple molecules in the inner disks .    at the beginning of the paper",
    "i highlighted some fundamental science questions that required direct observational constraints from the gas in the disk .",
    "to conclude , i would like to address them again from the actual state of the observational study of gas .    _",
    "( i ) how long does the protoplanetary disk last ? _ in general terms ,",
    "disk gas diagnostics are not detected when the signatures of the dust in the disk have disappeared .",
    "thus , as a first approximation the gas in the disk disappears almost simultaneously with the signatures from small dust particles .",
    "nonetheless , we should be aware of a few details : ( a ) with the exception of h@xmath5 emission , there are many sources for which we know that they have a disk , but given sensitivity issues , we are not able to detect any gas tracer ; ( b ) gas has been observed in several wtts stars ( e.g. , h@xmath3 in the uv and nir ) , and in transitional disks ( e.g. , h@xmath3 in the near - ir , co at 4.7 @xmath9 m , [ ne ii ] at 12 @xmath9 m ) ; ( c ) unbiased surveys for hot / warm gas in a large sample of wtts have yet not been performed ; ( d ) surveys of h@xmath5 at high spectral resolution need to be done in larger samples of wtts in star - forming regions of different ages .",
    "if the accretion rate and spectral resolution are low , one can easily miss objects accreting gas at low accretion rates . in summary ,",
    "an estimate of disk gas lifetime independent of dust is still required .    _",
    "( ii ) how much material is available for forming giant planets ? _ on this aspect our hopes are fainter .",
    "several surveys for h@xmath3 emission in the mir showed that the emission is observed only in a handful of objects , and that in these objects the gas is heated by an additional ( to dust collisions ) heating mechanism ( uv , x - ray excitation ) .",
    "although these results confirm our two - layer picture of the disk , in practice these results mean that we are blind to the disk s mid - plane and that we are unable to know directly how much mass is in the giant planet forming region of the disk .",
    "the good news are two fold : ( a ) in objects with data at several wavelengths , an educated guess can be found from modeling the surface density ( see next point ) ; ( b ) at some point the disk should become optically thin -by dust evolution- then we will be able to measure the gas mass .    _",
    "( iii ) how do the density and temperature of the disk vary as a function of the radius ?",
    "_ there is a growing number of sources ( e.g. , tw hya , ab aur ) for which we start to have information from several gas tracers at wavelengths from the uv to the ( sub)-mm . in such sources ,",
    "we can attempt to constrain the disk structure employing a disk model aimed to fit all the available data . therefore , at least for a handful of objects , by modeling multiwavelength spectroscopy , we have the potential to constrain the density and temperature as a function of radius .",
    "however , we should always keep in mind that we observe emission from the disk s surface layer and that the mid - plane temperature and density will be deduced from the model .",
    "hence , the final gas mass deduced will be model dependent .    _",
    "( iv ) what are the dynamics of the disk ? _ in this aspect we had good news . to detect gas lines in the ir we commonly use the highest spectral resolution available . at the present ,",
    "the resolution is sufficiently high to spectrally resolve the lines .",
    "this allows the modeling of the line shape ; therefore , constraints in the dynamics of the emitting gas can be derived .",
    "recently , with the combination of ao and high - resolution spectroscopy , it has been possible to spatially resolve gas disk emission directly or to spatially resolve the spectroastrometric signal with spectra taken at different slit orientations .",
    "so far the observed gas is consistent with gas in keplerian rotation .",
    "this kind of studies should be extended in the future to a larger number of systems .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the ascona planet formation meeting for inviting me to give the observations of gas in disks talk , and to r. nelson , c.p .",
    "dullemond , c. clarke and s. fromang for kindly accepting that i present my talk as in individual contribution in this volume .",
