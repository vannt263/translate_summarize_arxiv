    "the hardy - littlewood maximal operator maps functions of bounded mean oscillation back to bmo .",
    "this is a classical result of bennett , devore , and sharpley @xcite .",
    "in addition to the original approach , which is direct , some alternative proofs relying on the properties of the muckenhoupt weights are available in @xcite .    the present paper is devoted to studying the counterpart of the boundedness @xmath1 in a context that comes from the regularity theory of parabolic partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "the class parabolic bmo is defined through a condition measuring mean oscillation in a special way . as opposed to the ordinary bmo space",
    ", a natural time lag appears in connection with parabolic bmo .",
    "it causes several challenges , many of which have only been addressed very recently ; see @xcite",
    ". roughly speaking , the positive and negative parts of the deviation from a constant only satisfy bounds in disjoint regions of the space time . for a function @xmath2 of space and time to be in @xmath3 , it suffices that @xmath4 see section [ subse : bmo ] for precise definitions .",
    "the condition above leads to many properties similar to those of the ordinary bmo , but it also allows for the possibility of arbitrarily fast growth in the negative time direction .",
    "consequently , the difference between parabolic bmo and its classical counterpart is remarkable .",
    "principal examples of partial differential equations with connection to parabolic bmo are the heat equation and its generalizations , most notably the doubly nonlinear equation @xmath5 logarithms of positive local solutions to , possibly with measure data , belong to parabolic bmo @xcite .",
    "this gives important examples of @xmath3 functions .",
    "a similar relation is also known to hold for elliptic partial differential equations and the ordinary bmo .",
    "consequently , the functions in parabolic bmo relate to those in ordinary bmo in a manner analogous to how supersolutions of the heat equation relate to those of the laplace equation .    the sets @xmath6 in @xmath7    it was already noted by moser @xcite and trudinger @xcite in the 1960s that positive supersolutions of have their logarithms in a parabolic bmo class .",
    "this fact is well - known to people working in the regularity theory of partial differential equations ; see @xcite",
    ". however , the literature on parabolic @xmath0 is still limited , and its history can be recounted quickly .",
    "the seminal papers of moser @xcite and trudinger @xcite established the connection between the partial differential equations and parabolic bmo .",
    "in addition , the parabolic john - nirenberg inequality was proved there .",
    "the proof was simplified in @xcite and extended to spaces of homogeneous type in @xcite .",
    "those papers date back to the 1980s .",
    "a method to derive global estimates from the local parabolic john - nirenberg inequality was developed in @xcite , and it was also used to answer a question about summability of the supersolutions of .",
    "this was in 2014 .",
    "more recent advances in the field are coupled with new trends in the theory of multidimensional one - sided weights ; see @xcite .",
    "the techniques relevant in that context combine argumentation typical to the one - dimensional one - sided weight theory to that of harmonic and geometric analysis of partial differential equations .",
    "the usual challenge is to find a way to compensate the loss of many important tools such as the besicovitch covering lemma and the standard maximal function techniques .",
    "recall that the known results on parabolic @xmath0 include a john  nirenberg type inequality @xcite , a coifman - rochberg type characterization through a special theory of weights @xcite , and geometric local - to - global properties @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to show that the same operator of forward - in - time maximal averages ( see section [ sec : nota ] and figure [ fig2:pararectangle ] ) @xmath8 that generates the parabolic weight theory also maps the class of positive functions in parabolic @xmath0 into itself .",
    "the boundedness of the parabolic forward - in - time maximal operator is consistent with the `` elliptic '' result in @xcite when only positive functions are involved .",
    "namely , the results coincide if we restrict our attention to functions with no time - dependency . in the time - dependent case ,",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] is far more general . on the other hand ,",
    "if we allow the functions under study to be sign - changing , a full analogue of the bennett - devore - sharpley result will be false in the parabolic context .",
    "hence there are indigenously parabolic phenomena involved in our result .",
    "see theorem [ thm : main ] and the related discussion for more precise statements .",
    "we conclude the introduction by briefly describing the structure of the present paper .",
    "it is divided into three main sections and an additional section discussing the one - dimensional analogue of the problem under study .",
    "section [ sec : nota ] is used to set up the notation and to introduce the operators and the function classes we study . in section [ sec :",
    "preli ] , we prove several auxiliary results such as a chain argument , and we also construct a special dyadic grid . these results are needed to solve problems that arise from the time - dependent nature of the main theorems . once all the preparations have been carried out , we prove the main theorems , namely lemma [ lemma : boundedness ] asserting the boundedness of @xmath9 and theorem [ thm : main ] refining the result . at the end of the paper , we show how a simplified argument can be used the prove a slightly stronger result in dimension one .",

    "the cases with @xmath233 and @xmath234 are not very different since the fact that the dyadic grid only approximates the real one only comes into the picture in few occasions . in order to keep the notation more simple , we work on the case with rational @xmath17 , and comment the corrections that should be done with approximate dyadic grid .",

    "we decompose @xmath240 where the components are @xmath241 in case we use the approximate dyadic grid , the stopping rule applies to @xmath242 rectangles while the indicator functions in the decomposition of @xmath2 are left as they are .",
    "recall the details of the dyadic grid from lemma [ lemma : dyadic ] .    by construction , @xmath243 . by the parabolic john - nirenberg inequality ( lemma [ lemma : jn ] and remark [ remark : john - nirenberg ] ) , we have that @xmath244 if @xmath245 is small enough . by elementary properties of the maximal functions @xmath246 by the fact that @xmath247 , the supports of @xmath248 are disjoint , we conclude that @xmath249    moreover , @xmath250 so using the previous computation , we obtain @xmath251 subtracting @xmath252 and letting @xmath253 , we get @xmath254      next consider the function @xmath197 in @xmath255 . for computing the averages , the maximal function only has the region @xmath256 at its disposal .",

    "this completes the proof of the case of small rectangles .      in general , we may estimate the full maximal function @xmath262 by the sum of its two parts : @xmath263 the first term was bounded in the previous subsections , and the second one was the large rectangle case .    up to now",
    "we have proved that if @xmath194 and @xmath37 , then @xmath206 . in order to get the claimed @xmath264 , we still have to show that @xmath265 , that is , @xmath266 compare to the identity .",
    "however , this can be reduced to the case just handled .",
    "take three blocks similar to @xmath267 in the previous considerations : @xmath268 now @xmath269 the second term @xmath270 is clear by the same argument that lead to the large rectangle case inequality . for the first term , we can estimate @xmath271 where the second term is bounded by the very definition of @xmath41 together with the fact @xmath272 , and the first term is dealt with the small rectangle inequality that we proved previously .",
