    "the phenomenon of zitterbewegung ( zb , trembling motion ) , devised in 1930 by erwin schrodinger  @xcite , has been for the last 80 years a subject of controversy and excitement .",
    "the interest in this phenomenon experienced a strong revival in 2005 , when it was demonstrated that the trembling motion can occur also in solids  @xcite . since then there has been a real surge of papers proposing zb in various periodic systems , as reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the nature of zb in solids was investigated and it was shown that , in its `` classical '' form analogous to zb in a vacuum  @xcite , the trembling motion represents oscillations of velocity when an electron moves in a periodic potential of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the situation resembles a roller - coaster : when the train moves upwards gaining the potential energy , it slows down ; when the train goes down losing the potential energy , it accelerates .",
    "however , in the solid state literature the largely prevailing picture is based on the bloch theorem in which electrons are treated as quasi - free particles with a modified ( effective ) mass .",
    "this picture suggests that the electrons move in a solid with a constant velocity .",
    "the same approach is used in the transport theory , in which carrier velocity is assumed constant and equal to  @xmath2 , where  @xmath3 is the wave vector and  @xmath4 is the effective mass . to the author s knowledge , there exist only two textbooks discussing an instantaneous carrier velocity in a crystal : `` wave mechanics of crystalline solids '' by r. a. smith  @xcite and `` semiconductor physics '' by p. s. kireev  @xcite .",
    "the problem arises : how to reconcile the two pictures ?",
    "this is the first purpose of our work .",
    "we show that the above question is related to the difference between carrier s momentum and quasi - momentum in a periodic potential .",
    "our second purpose is to introduce properly an effective mass of carriers . in solid state textbooks the effective mass",
    "is always defined as a quantity relating an external force to carrier s acceleration .",
    "we show that it is by far more useful to define the effective mass as a quantity relating the average carrier velocity to the quasi - momentum  @xmath5 .",
    "the `` velocity mass '' is a scalar for spherical nonparabolic energy bands  @xmath0 , whereas the `` acceleration mass '' is not .",
    "important applications of the velocity mass are indicated .",
    "in addition , we briefly describe a `` semi - relativistic '' behavior of charge carriers in narrow - gap semiconductors including monolayer graphene .",
    "this feature was discussed in the past but gained new significance with `` the rise of graphene ''  @xcite and the advancement of zitterbewegung . to ensure the completeness and continuity of presentation ,",
    "we include in our exposition a few elements which are already known from the literature .",
    "as it stands , the text has both scientific and pedagogical aspects .",
    "we begin by general considerations concerned with the motion of charge carriers in crystalline solids .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron in a periodic potential  @xmath6 is @xmath7 where  @xmath8 is the free electron mass .",
    "the periodicity signifies  @xmath9 for  @xmath10 being a lattice vector .",
    "the velocity operator is given by the hamilton equation @xmath11 the same result is obtained from the relation  @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the acceleration operator is @xmath13   = -\\frac{1}{m_0 } \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial { \\hat{x}}_i } = \\frac{1}{m_0}f_i^{pr},\\ ] ] where  @xmath14 is a periodic force acting on the electron moving in a periodic potential .",
    "equation  ( 3 ) is equivalent to the second newton law of motion in an operator form .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 3 ) that the momentum operator does not commute with the hamiltonian  ( 1 ) , so it is not a constant of the motion . in consequence , the velocity of eq .  ( 2 ) and the acceleration of eq .  ( 3 ) are also not constants of the motion .",
    "it is intuitively clear that , since the potential and the resulting force in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are periodic in  @xmath15 , the acceleration and the velocity will also be periodic functions of  @xmath15 .",
    "this result has an elementary classical interpretation .",
    "classically , the total electron energy is  @xmath16 , so if the potential energy oscillates , the kinetic energy ( i.e. , the velocity ) also oscillates to keep the total energy constant .",
    "this is , in fact , the physical origin of the trembling motion of electrons in crystalline solids , see ref .",
    "the results given in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) apply to any hamiltonian with a scalar potential .",
    "the specificity of a crystalline solid is that the potential is periodic , so the bloch theorem applies .",
    "thus @xmath17 where  @xmath18 is the energy of the  @xmath19-th band depending on the wave vector  @xmath3 .",
    "the bloch state is  @xmath20 in which the bloch amplitude has the same periodicity as the potential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity  @xmath5 is an eigenvalue of the quasi - momentum operator  @xmath22 , which should be carefully distinguished from the standard momentum operator  @xmath23 introduced in eq .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( 1 ) is invariant with respect to transformations possessing the symmetry of the potential and there should exist a constant of the motion corresponding to this invariance .",
    "this constant of the motion is precisely  @xmath5 .",
    "it means that the bloch state  @xmath24 should also be an eigenstate of the quasi - momentum  @xmath25 , i.e. there should be by definition @xmath26 we try to find an explicit expression for  @xmath22 looking for the quasi - momentum operator in the form ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath27 in which  @xmath28 is a function of coordinates .",
    "we have @xmath29 { \\psi_{n\\bm k}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting  @xmath30 we get  @xmath31 , so that eq .",
    "( 5 ) is satisfied if @xmath32 in the second term in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and  ( 8) the differentiation acts only on the expression in parentheses . equation  ( 8) is instructive , as it shows explicitly that the operators of momentum and quasi - momentum are distinctly different . by using eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and  ( 5 ) one easily shows that  @xmath33 , so that the quasi - momentum  @xmath34 is really a constant of the motion .",
    "to say it differently @xmath35=0,\\ ] ] which means that the periodic potential  @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) does not change the quasi - momentum  @xmath22 whereas , as follows from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it periodically changes the momentum  @xmath23 and velocity  @xmath36 .",
    "still , the electron does not radiate because it is in the bloch eigenenergy state .",
    "suppose now that , in addition to the periodic potential  @xmath6 , the electron experiences an additional nonperiodic potential  @xmath37 .",
    "this potential can be due to an external field , an impurity , a defect , etc .",
    "then the total hamiltonian is @xmath38 it is easy to see that @xmath39 where  @xmath40 .",
    "thus the momentum is changed by both periodic and nonperiodic potentials , whereas the quasi - momentum is changed only by the additional nonperiodic potential .",
    "the question arises how to reconcile the oscillating electron velocity  @xmath41 described in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) with the velocity appearing , for example , in the transport phenomena and other kinetic effects in crystalline solids .",
    "the time - dependent instantaneous velocity is given in general in the heisenberg picture by @xmath42 and it is this velocity operator that leads to the trembling motion , see ref .",
    "let us calculate an average of  @xmath43 on the bloch state  @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain by a simple manipulation @xmath44 where  @xmath45 .",
    "thus the average velocity in the bloch state is time independent because of the basic property of eq .",
    "the average velocity has been calculated in various ways , see refs .",
    "below we use the method based on the hellmann - feynman theorem  @xcite .",
    "let us first write the schrodinger equation for the bloch amplitude . as follows from eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 depends parametrically on  @xmath3 .",
    "we have @xmath48 in which the first equality follows from the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "further @xmath49 so that @xmath50 the result  ( 19 ) is simple and important .",
    "it relates the average of instantaneous velocity in the bloch state  @xmath51 to the electron energy  @xmath18 given as a function of the quasi - momentum  @xmath34 .",
    "below we will consider a specific energy band , so we drop the band index  @xmath19 .",
    "now we want to associate the above results with an effective mass of charge carriers in an energy band . in textbooks",
    "one considers standard parabolic and spherical energy bands described by the energy - wave vector relation  @xmath52 , where  @xmath53 is a constant effective mass at the band edge .",
    "it is then shown that such a mass relates carrier s acceleration to an external force .",
    "however , we want to consider a more general case of spherical but nonparabolic energy bands in which the energy depends on the absolute value of the wave vector in an arbitrary way , i.e.  @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , many iii - v semiconducting compounds ( insb , inas , gasb , gaas , inp ) as well as ii - vi compounds ( hgte , cdte , hgcdte , hgse ) and their alloys possess the conduction bands of this type .",
    "in contrast to the procedure adopted in textbooks , we define an effective mass not by a relation between an external force and acceleration , but as a quantity relating the average velocity  @xmath55 to the quasi - momentum  @xmath34 .",
    "thus we _ define the effective mass _ by the equality @xmath56 where  @xmath55 is given by eq .",
    "since  @xmath55 and  @xmath34 are vectors , the mass  @xmath4 is in principle a  @xmath57 tensor .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 19 ) and the sphericity of the band we calculate @xmath58 where in the last term we adopt the sum convention over the repeated coordinate subscript  @xmath59 . using the definition  ( 20 ) ,",
    "the inverse mass tensor is @xmath60 by equating eq .",
    "( 21 ) with eq .",
    "( 22 ) we obtain @xmath61 thus the inverse mass tensor is a _ scalar _ for a spherical energy band @xmath62 the average velocity is finally , see eq .",
    "( 22 ) , @xmath63 recalling that  @xmath64 , see eq .  ( 19 ) , we can write @xmath65 which shows an analogy between the average momentum in the bloch state  @xmath66 and the quasi - momentum . however , it is known that for electrons and light holes in semiconductors there is usually  @xmath67 , so that  @xmath68 .",
    "this shows once again the difference between momentum and quasi - momentum .",
    "equation  ( 25 ) represents the basic formula for velocity used in the description of charge carriers in semiconductors and metals .",
    "here we have obtained this formula with two important qualifications .",
    "first , on the left - hand side we have the _ average velocity _ of a carrier in the bloch state , not the instantaneous velocity considered in the beginning , see eq .",
    "second , on the right - hand side we have the velocity effective mass defined in eq .",
    "this mass depends in general on carrier s energy ( or wave vector ) . since the average velocity  @xmath55 is expressed by the",
    "_ first derivative _",
    "@xmath69 , the velocity effective mass  @xmath4 is also related to the first derivative  @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` acceleration '' effective mass  @xmath70 relating force to acceleration , as introduced in textbooks , is given by the second derivative of energy with respect to  @xmath3 , so this mass does not enter into the basic formula  ( 25 ) , unless one takes the simplest energy band described by  @xmath52 . as is easy to see , in this particular case both masses are equal to  @xmath71 .",
    "we emphasize that the velocity mass , defined in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , is much more useful than the acceleration mass defined in textbooks . in particular , it is the velocity mass that defines carrier s mobility and is measured in various experiments .",
    "we discuss this point below .    to conclude this section , we relate the first derivative  @xmath72 to the group velocity of a carrier in a periodic potential .",
    "let us form a wave packet of bloch states @xmath73 it is assumed that the packet is narrow in  @xmath3 space and it is centered around the value of  @xmath74 .",
    "this means that in the coordinate space the packet extends over several unit cells .",
    "thus the amplitudes  @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( 27 ) are non - vanishing only for small values of  @xmath76 . in consequence",
    ", it is possible to take an average value of  @xmath77 out of the integral sign .",
    "we further have @xmath78 the integrand on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 28 ) is formally identical to that of a free particle and one may apply to this wave packet the well known arguments determining the group velocity , which gives @xmath79 where the derivative is taken at  @xmath80 . thus the average velocity given in eq .",
    "( 19 ) is also the group velocity of the carrier .",
    "now we consider an instructive and sufficiently general example of a band structure in semiconductors in order to illustrate consequences of the above formalism . as mentioned in relation to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and  ( 4 ) , the bloch states are solutions to the eigenenergy equation with the hamiltonian having a periodic potential of the crystal lattice . however , it is known that , for questions related to the band structure near a specific point of the brillouin zone or to problems of carriers in external fields , it is more practical to work with the luttinger - kohn  ( lk ) representation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the lk functions are  @xmath81 , where  @xmath82 are the bloch periodic amplitudes taken at a fixed point  @xmath83 of the brillouin zone .",
    "we take for simplicity  @xmath84 , i.e. the zone center .",
    "it is clear that the lk amplitudes satisfy the eigenenergy equation @xmath85{u_{n 0}}=\\epsilon_{n0}{u_{n 0}},\\ ] ] where  @xmath86 is the energy of the  @xmath19-th band at  @xmath87 .",
    "one can show that the lk functions form a complete orthogonal set , so one can represent a bloch state as @xmath88 in which  @xmath89 are  @xmath3-dependent coefficients .",

    "the band - edge mass  @xmath53 in most semiconducting materials is much smaller than the free electron mass  @xmath8 , so neglecting the free electron term  @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( 32 ) was justified .",
    "it was remarked that the two - band  @xmath112 model  ( 2bm ) for the band structure of semiconductors closely resembles the description of free relativistic electrons in a vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( 33 ) , having the quasi - momentum terms off the diagonal , looks very much like the dirac equation without spin , while the dispersion  ( 34 ) is analogous to the relativistic relation  @xmath113 with the correspondence  @xmath114 and @xmath115 it is easy to determine the maximum velocity  @xmath116 in the 2bm @xmath117 in light of our previous considerations ,  @xmath116 is the maximum average velocity in the bloch state . the value of  @xmath116 can be determined by measuring the energy gap  @xmath97 and the band - edge mass  @xmath53 in a semiconductor material .",
    "it turns out that the velocity  @xmath116 is almost the same in different materials and is given by  @xmath118 cm / s , i.e. it is about 300 times smaller than the maximum velocity for relativistic electrons in a vacuum  @xmath119 . using eq .",

    "one obtains a very good description which confirms the validity of the two - band model for narrow - gap materials .",
    "in particular , one obtains the above mentioned large value of  @xmath127 .    regarding the phenomenon of zitterbewegung we want to emphasize the following subtle point .",
    "if one calculates the velocity operator using the matrix hamiltonian  ( 33 ) :  @xmath133 , the velocity matrix does not commute with the hamiltonian :  @xmath134 , so the velocity depends on time and it is the _ instantaneous velocity _ containing the zitterbewegung , see refs .",
    "@xcite . however , if one calculates the velocity using the energy  ( 34 ) :  @xmath135 , it is the _ average velocity _ not depending on time and given by eq .",
    "this means that the two - band model in the matrix form still `` keeps track '' of the periodic hamiltonian  ( 1 ) from which it originates , because both give the zitterbewegung . on the other hand , in the energy  ( 34 )",
    "the track of periodicity of the original hamiltonian  ( 1 ) is already lost .",
    "one can use the lk transformation to separate the conduction and valence bands in the hamiltonian  ( 33 ) , which gives  @xmath136 corresponding to the above mentioned expansion of the square root in eq .",
    "( 34 ) . in this case",
    "the velocity is  @xmath137 , i.e. it is the average velocity for each band with no zitterbewegung .",
    "thus the two - band model is the simplest  @xmath1 description reproducing the essential features of the initial periodic hamiltonian  ( 1 ) .",
    "finally , we want to consider briefly the important case of monolayer two - dimensional graphene in light of the above discussion .",
    "graphene s band structure near the k point of the brillouin zone is described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath138 where  @xmath118 cm / s .",
    "the above form can be considered to be a special case of the two - band model  ( 33 ) with the vanishing gap  @xmath139 and properly chosen matrix elements  @xmath140 and  @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting energy dispersion is linear in quasi - momentum :  @xmath142 , where  @xmath143 . in view of our semi - relativistic analogy",
    "this case can be considered to be the `` extreme relativistic limit '' .",
    "the matrix velocity operator  @xmath133 does not commute with the hamiltonian  ( 41 ) and the instantaneous velocity contains the zb component  @xcite .",
    "the velocity  @xmath144 represents an average velocity calculated in eq .",

    "this gives , as before ,  @xmath149 , see eq .",
    "one can also write  @xmath150 which means that at the band edge ( called in the literature `` the dirac point '' ) the effective mass is zero , but as the energy increases the mass increases as well .",
    "now let us suppose that an external force is applied along the  @xmath151 direction to an electron characterized by  @xmath152 . according to eq .",
    "( 12 ) there is  @xmath153 . since for  @xmath152 there is  @xmath154 .",
    "thus the change of  @xmath155 due to the external force goes entirely into the change of the mass .",
    "in this section we consider the use of the velocity effective mass in spherical and spheroidal energy bands . at the end",
    "we mention some properties of the acceleration effective mass of charge carriers .",
    "we begin with the velocity mass  @xmath4 which , as mentioned above , is much more useful than the acceleration mass . in our considerations below we",
    "are concerned with the average electron motion related to the quasi - momentum , so we drop the sign of `` average '' over the velocity , i.e. we write  @xmath156 .",
    "the important property of the velocity mass is that it is measured in the cyclotron resonance  ( cr ) .",
    "we first demonstrate it using the classical electron motion in a magnetic field .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath157 where  @xmath158 $ ] is a magnetic field applied along the  @xmath159 direction . using the definition  ( 20 ) of the velocity mass for a spherical band :  @xmath160 , we have @xmath161 since ,",
    "as we showed above ,  @xmath4 for a nonparabolic band depends in general on electron energy , one can imagine that  @xmath4 depends also on time if the energy during the motion as not constant .",
    "however , it is well known that a constant and uniform magnetic field does not do any work , so the electron energy is a constant . for this reason we assumed  @xmath4 not to depend on time in arriving at eq .",

    "( 44 ) and arrive at the second - order differential equation for  @xmath163 , which can be easily solved in terms of trigonometric functions .",
    "instead , we simply guess the solutions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :  @xmath164 and  @xmath165 , in which  @xmath166 is the cyclotron frequency with which the electron circles on the orbit . using the above solutions one obtains from eqs .",
    "( 44 ) and  ( 45 ) the same result @xmath167 thus the cyclotron frequency is determined by the velocity mass  @xmath4 .",
    "the cyclotron orbit can be obtained by integrating the velocity over time , which gives :  @xmath168 .",

    "the same result concerning the velocity mass can be obtained from the quantization of motion in a magnetic field . to be specific",
    ", we use the orbital and spin quantization resulting from the band structure of insb - type iii - v semiconducting compounds .",
    "the band structure includes three levels at the  @xmath169 point of the brillouin zone ( eight bands including spin ) .",

    "thus , again , the cyclotron frequency is determined by the velocity effective mass  @xmath4 .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to the so called `` inverted '' band structure of zero - gap and narrow - gap ii - vi compounds based on hgte and hgse , see  @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", the basic relation for the classical transport theory is  @xmath180 .",
    "this leads to the definition of carrier s mobility  @xmath181 , which involves the relaxation time  @xmath182 and the velocity mass  @xmath4  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the mobility is directly affected by the energy variation of  @xmath183 . some d.c .",
    "transport phenomena at high magnetic fields do not depend on the relaxation time so that , by studying them , one gains a direct access to the mass  @xmath4  @xcite . finally , the free - carrier optics depends on the band structure only through the velocity mass .",
    "and so the reflectivity depends on  @xmath184 , the magneto - reflectivity on  @xmath185 , the faraday rotation is proportional to  @xmath186 and the voigt phase shift to  @xmath187 . here",
    "the brackets denote appropriate averages over electron energies in the band  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of  @xmath183 gives then a direct information on the band structure .",
    "another strong indication , that the velocity effective mass is much more useful than the acceleration mass , is the fact that the corresponding mass is commonly used in the special theory of relativity  ( str ) . in str",

    "it is seen that , using the semi - relativistic analogy :  @xmath193 and  @xmath194 , the relativistic velocity mass has the same energy dependence as the effective velocity mass resulting from the two - band  @xmath112 model , eq .",
    "we mention that the relativistic velocity - dependent mass  @xmath195 is somewhat reluctantly used in str by some authors because of its unorthodox transformation properties , see  @xcite . however , the transformation problem is not relevant for solids .    to conclude our considerations of the velocity mass we treat an important case of ellipsoidal energy bands which occur in semiconducting ii - vi lead salts pbte , pbse , pbs , as well as in silicon and germanium .",
    "such an energy band with arbitrary nonparabolicity can be described by the relation  @xcite @xmath196 where  @xmath197 is a `` reasonable '' function of energy describing the nonparabolicity of the band .",
    "the limiting assumption is that the shape of the ellipsoid does not vary with the energy .",
    "we use the sum convention over the repeated coordinate indices .",
    "the tensor  @xmath198 is symmetric and it can be brought to a diagonal form by an appropriate rotation of coordinates in  @xmath3 space . then the unequal diagonal components  @xmath199 express band s ellipsoidal shape .",
    "an inverse tensor of velocity mass is defined by the relation  ( 22 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the velocity is  @xmath200 , one obtains with the help of eq .",
    "( 50 ) @xmath201 for a parabolic band there is  @xmath202 , and the inverse mass components are numbers .",
    "a spherical band with arbitrary nonparabolicity is described by  @xmath203 , the kronecker delta .",
    "this gives  @xmath204 , [ see eq .  ( 50 ) ] , which is equivalent to the spherical case considered above .",
    "finally , we calculate the inverse tensor of acceleration mass for a spherical nonparabolic band  @xmath0 .",
    "the general expression of the inverse mass tensor relating force to acceleration is well known @xmath205 a simple manipulation gives @xmath206 it is seen that , in contrast to the velocity mass , the acceleration mass is not a scalar quantity even for a spherical energy band .",
    "interestingly , it is the band nonparabolicity that makes the acceleration mass non - scalar . for a standard parabolic band :  @xmath52 , the second term in eq .",
    "( 53 ) vanishes , so that  @xmath207 .",
    "this is identical with the velocity mass for a parabolic band . only in this simple case",
    "the two masses coincide . because of the non - scalar character of the acceleration mass  ( 53 ) the acceleration in a nonparabolic band is not parallel to the force .",
    "this feature is well known in the special relativity , which illustrates once again the semi - relativistic analogy .",
    "we summarize our work by enumerating the main conclusions and indicating the corresponding equations . for a carrier moving in a periodic potential ,",
    "the momentum , velocity , and acceleration are not constants of the motion , see eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) . the quasi - momentum , which is a distinctly different operator from the momentum , see eq .",
    "( 8) , is a constant of the motion in a bloch state , see eq .",
    "the average electron velocity in a bloch state is given by a gradient of the energy with respect to the quasi - momentum  @xmath5 , see eq .",
    "it is this average velocity  @xmath55 which is used in the classical transport theory for charge carriers . a `` velocity effective mass '' is defined as a quantity relating the average velocity to the quasi - momentum , see eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and  ( 21 ) .",
    "the velocity mass for a spherical energy band is a scalar , see eq .",
    "( 23 ) , and it enters into the basic relation for the transport theory , see eq .",
    "( 25 ) . a two - band  @xmath1 model in the matrix form",
    "is the simplest description of the band structure that still keeps track of the periodic potential , see eq .",
    "the two - band  @xmath1 hamiltonian  ( 33 ) and the resulting energy  ( 34 ) bear strong similarity to the description of free relativistic electrons in a vacuum .",
    "in particular , they lead to an analog of the famous einstein relation between the mass and the energy , see eq .",
    "in this perspective , the band structure of gapless graphene can be regarded as an extreme relativistic case .",
    "the velocity effective mass is much more useful than the acceleration mass commonly introduced in solid state textbooks . in particular , it is the velocity mass that is measured in the cyclotron resonance , see eqs .",
