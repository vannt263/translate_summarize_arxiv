    "@xcite and other subsequent theoretical proposals  @xcite , are formulated for the discrete regime .",
    "these proposals require qudits ( multi - dimensional qubits ) for the encoding and distribution of the secret quantum states .",

    ", the secret state is encoded by the dealer by interfering the secret quantum state with one of a pair of epr entangled beams on a 1:1 beam splitter .",

    "the two outputs from this beam splitter , and the second entangled beam , form the three shares to be distributed to the players in the protocol . the second epr entangled beam , although not containing a component of the secret state , does share entanglement with the other two beams .",
    "this entanglement ensures that the quantum features of the secret state can be reconstructed .",
    "the security of the scheme is governed by the strength of the entanglement in the dealer protocol . in the case of finite entanglement",
    ", some information of the secret state can still be retrieved by individual players .",
    "the security can be further enhanced , however , by using additional classical encoding techniques in the dealer protocol .",

    "these reconstruction protocols can be thought of as _ disentangling protocols _ as the secret state is embedded within two states which are epr entangled .",
    "this is analogous to the disentangling protocols in the discrete regime @xcite .",
    "some of these reconstruction protocols are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the specific state reconstruction protocol used in the @xmath7 quantum state sharing scheme depends on the constituent players which form the authorized group .",
    "the authorized group formed when players 1 and 2 collaborate , which we henceforth denote as the \\{1,2 } , can reconstruct the secret state using the _ mach - zehnder protocol _ , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the \\{1,2 } authorized group completes a mach - zehnder interferometer by interfering the shares on a 1:1 beam splitter .",
    "the quadratures of the reconstructed secret are given by @xmath38 since this reconstruction protocol effectively reverses the dealer encoding protocol , the \\{1,2 } authorized group can reconstruct the secret state to an arbitrary precision , independent of the amount of squeezing or additional gaussian noise employed in the dealer protocol .",
    "for the \\{1,3 } and \\{2,3 } authorized groups , more complicated reconstruction protocols are required .",
    "this complexity is due to the asymmetry of the entanglement and gaussian noise in each of the shares in the authorized groups .",
    "the \\{1,3 } and \\{2,3 } authorized groups can , in theory , reconstruct the secret state to an arbitrary precision using a phase insensitive amplifier .",
    "this can be achieved by carefully controlling the inherent noise coupled into the output state as a result of the amplification process , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) .",

    "we term this point the _ unity gain _ point ( analogous to the unity gain point in quantum teleportation @xcite ) . at the unity gain point",
    "the expectation value of the quadrature amplitudes of the reconstructed state is the same as the secret state .",
    "furthermore , the noise contributions do not appear on the quadratures of the reconstructed state . as a result",
    ", the security of the scheme can be arbitrarily increased by either increasing the squeezing or the additional noise in the dealer protocol , without degrading the quality of the reconstructed state .",
    "we point out the significance of the unity gain point , as all the reconstructions protocols presented in this paper can achieve some form of unity gain .",
    "although in theory , this reconstruction protocol can be used to reconstruct the secret to an arbitrary precision , experimentally it is extremely difficult to directly access the second input field of the phase insensitive amplifier .",
    "we now turn our attention to examining more experimentally achievable reconstruction protocols .      in their original proposal ,",
    "tyc and sanders suggested using a pair of optical parametric amplifiers to perform the \\{1,3 } and \\{2,3 } secret reconstructions  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1](c ) .",
    "we term this protocol the _ two optical parametric amplifier protocol_. in this protocol , the two shares are interfered on a 1:1 beam splitter .",
    "the two resulting beams are each noiselessly amplified using phase sensitive optical parametric amplifiers , with amplifying gains of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . after the noiseless amplification , the secret state is reconstructed by interfering the two amplified beams on a second 1:1 beam splitter .",
    "the quadrature of the reconstructed secret can be expressed by @xmath49 where @xmath29 is the amplifying gain of the optical parametric amplifiers , and the coefficients @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 at an amplifying unity gain of @xmath52 , the quadratures of the reconstructed state can be expressed as @xmath44 in the limit of infinite squeezing in the dealer protocol and at unity gain , the secret state is reconstructed to an arbitrary precision .",
    "this scheme requires significant quantum resources , however , with two optical parametric amplifiers in the reconstruction protocol .",
    "furthermore , in the reconstruction protocol these optical parametric amplifiers must have precisely controlled amplifying gains as well as high non - linearity .",
    "experimentally , high non - linearity can be achieved by using high peak power pulsed light sources , either in q - switched or mode - locked setups , or by enhancing the optical intensity within an optical resonator .",
    "however , both of these techniques cause significant coupling of vacuum fields into the output state , resulting in a significant decrease of quantum efficiency .",
    "the pulsed systems often suffer distortion of optical wave fronts in the non - linear medium , resulting in poor optical interference and losses , whilst the resonators couple in vacuum fields via intra - resonator losses , the resonator mirrors and the second harmonic pump field .",
    "for these reasons it is desirable to investigate reconstruction protocols that do not rely on optical parametric amplifiers , but instead utilize linear optics , which are not susceptible to these type of losses and inefficiencies .",
    "an alternative reconstruction protocol that uses linear optics and electro - optic feed - forward to reconstruct the secret state  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( d ) .",
    "we term this protocol the _ single feed - forward reconstruction protocol_. in this protocol the shares are interfered on a beam splitter , where the two resulting output beams are denoted as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the proportion of entanglement and additional noise between share \\{3 } and share \\{1 } ( or \\{2 } ) are not equal , hence , an appropriate beamsplitter ratio must be chosen so that the entanglement and additional noise contributions are proportional on one of the quadratures of the beam splitter output @xmath53 as a result of this interference . in the limit of infinite squeezing or additional noise in the dealer protocol , the optimum beam splitter ratio is 2:1 ( for convenience we will use this beam splitter ratio for the rest of this analysis unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "this interference reconstructs the phase quadrature of the secret state on the phase quadrature of beam splitter output @xmath53 . as a result of this interference the amplitude quadrature @xmath55 obtains additional noise fluctuations .",
    "it is possible to cancel the noise on the amplitude quadrature @xmath55 , however , by recognizing that this noise is correlated with the noise on the amplitude quadrature @xmath56 . by detecting @xmath57 and imparting these fluctuations onto @xmath55 with a well chosen electronic gain @xmath29 via an electro - optic feed - forward loop ,",

    ", the quadratures of the reconstructed secret can be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the optical quadrature gains of the reconstructed secret , given by @xmath60 .",
    "the phase quadrature gain is set by the reconstruction beam splitter ratio 2:1 to be @xmath61 , whilst the amplitude quadrature gain @xmath62 has an additional contribution due to the feed - forward process , which is a function of the electronic gain @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to the optical quadrature gain product @xmath63 as the _ unity gain _ point . at unity gain ,",
    "the quadratures of the reconstructed secret are given by @xmath64 in the limit of infinite squeezing in the dealer protocol , the reconstructed secret is directly related to the secret state via a local unitary parametric operation .",
    "this reconstructed state can only be achieved using quantum resources .",
    "if required , a reverse local unitary parametric operation , can be applied to the reconstructed state to transform the reconstructed secret state into the original form of the secret state . since",
    "this unitary parametric operation is a local operation and requires no entanglement , this shows the quantum nature of the state reconstruction is contained within the feed - forward reconstruction protocol , and not by the subsequent operations .",
    "although the single feed - forward protocol is sufficient for demonstrating the quantum nature of quantum state sharing , it could be inconvenient in practice if the reconstructed state is a unitary transform of the secret state .",
    "it is useful to investigate alternative feed - forward protocols where the reconstructed state is in the same form as the secret state .",

    "double feed - forward reconstruction protocol_. in this protocol , share \\{1 } ( or \\{2 } ) is interfered with a vacuum state on a beam splitter .",
    "the reflectivity of the beam splitter has to be optimized , and in the limit of infinite squeezing or additional gaussian noise in the dealer protocol , the optimum beam splitter ratio is 1:1 ( for convenience we will use this beam splitter ratio for the rest of this analysis unless otherwise stated ) .",

    "we characterize state reconstruction in quantum state sharing by measuring the fidelity between the secret and reconstructed states @xmath77 , which is used in the characterization quantum teleportation experiments  @xcite .",
    "we also characterize the state reconstruction by measuring the signal transfer from the secret to the reconstructed state @xmath78 and the additional noise on the reconstructed state @xmath79 , which is used to characterize quantum teleportation  @xcite and quantum non - demolition experiments  @xcite .",
    "fidelity measures the overlap between the secret and reconstructed states , and can be expressed in terms of the input and the output state as @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "a fidelity of @xmath81 , implies perfect overlap between the secret and reconstructed states and corresponds to state reconstruction with arbitrary precision , whilst a fidelity of @xmath82 implies no overlap between the corresponding states .",

    "the secret state is encoded and distributed to the three players by interfering it with one of the epr entangled beams on a 1:1 beam splitter with a mode - matching efficiency of @xmath138 , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig0 ] . to increase the security of the scheme",
    ", the dealer introduces additional gaussian noise onto the three player shares using electro - optic modulation techniques . an alternative method for introducing this noise",
    "is to modulate the optical parametric amplifier resonator cavities with gaussian noise at the secret state sideband frequency . in our experiment ,",
    "the gaussian noise appears naturally as a result of de - coherence in the optical parametric amplifiers , resulting in mixed output states from the optical parametric amplifiers .",
    "these mixed states can be described as squeezed states with additional noise on the anti - squeezed quadratures .",
    "the additional noise on the epr beams corresponds exactly to equations ( [ dealer1 ] ) , ( [ dealer2 ] ) and ( [ dealer3 ] ) .",
    "experimentally , the variance of this noise can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the power of the 532 nm light used to pump the optical parametric amplifiers .",
    "typically , the additional gaussian noise has a noise variance of @xmath139  db above the quantum noise limit , for a corresponding amplitude quadrature squeezing of @xmath140  db below the quantum noise limit .      for the \\{1,2 }",

    "for the \\{2,3 } authorized group , the secret state is reconstructed using the single feed - forward reconstruction protocol , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( d ) . for this reconstruction protocol , the players shares are interfered on a 2:1 beam splitter with a mode - matching efficiency of @xmath142 . to improve the efficiency of the feed - forward loop , the optical power on the feed - forward detector",
    "is increased so that the quantum noise limit is sufficiently higher than the detector dark noise . typically for our experiment ,",
    "the dark noise on the feed - forward detector is @xmath143  db below the quantum noise limit .    in the original proposal , the amplitude quadrature of beam @xmath53 is directly modulated using electro - optic feed - forward techniques .",
    "this method , however , is prohibitive as amplitude modulators have quantum efficiencies of 50% .",
    "an alternative method that has a much higher quantum efficiency is to displace the amplitude quadrature of a separate strong local oscillator field @xmath144 .",
    "this local oscillator field is then interfered with field @xmath53 on a highly reflective beam splitter .",
    "the efficiency of this technique is equal to the beam splitter reflectivity of the highly reflective beam splitter . in our experiment",
    "we use a beam splitter ratio of 50:1 with a mode - matching efficiency of @xmath145 .",
    "both the secret and reconstructed quantum states for the access and adversary groups are measured using a single balanced homodyne detector , via a configuration of removable mirrors .",
    "assuming gaussian states , the secret and reconstructed states are completely characterized by measuring the amplitude and phase quadrature noise spectra , together with the calibration noise spectra .",
    "after detection , the total homodyne efficiency @xmath146 is factored into each measurement .",
    "this inference ensures accurate results ( this can be seen in the limit of poor homodyne efficiency , where all states measured correspond to vacuum states , resulting in state reconstruction to an arbitrary precision by both the access and adversary groups , which would be obviously incorrect ) . due to a control drift in our experimental setup ,",

    "although scaling up does not result in an increase in the number of active devices required by the players , the dealer does require an increasing number of two - mode squeezed states to hide the state being transmitted . despite this challenge , extending beyond three players should be possible and will elucidate the scaling properties of quantum state sharing .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to substitute one of the two squeezers in the dealer protocol by an electro - optic feed - forward and an amplifier as was done here for @xmath7 quantum state sharing , in which case the two - squeezer requirement  @xcite could be relaxed .",
