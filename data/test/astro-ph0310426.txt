    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are an unusual subtype of su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . wz sge - type dwarf have properties common to su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in that they show superoutbursts and superhumps .",
    "the most unusual properties of wz sge - type dwarf novae are characterized by the extremely low frequency of outbursts ( usually once in years to decades ) , the extremely large outburst amplitude ( exceeding 6 mag ) and long ( in some cases reaching @xmath0100 d before the quiescence is reached ) duration , and the lack or extreme deficiency of normal ( short ) outbursts , which , in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , occur more frequently than superoutbursts ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the origin of such unique characters has been long sought , both from the observational and theoretical sides .",
    "two basic ideas have been historically proposed , just like a descendant from historical discussions on the mechanism of dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "one is the mass - transfer instability model , which assumes the outer atmosphere of the extreme low - mass secondary in wz sge - type dwarf novae become unstable to the irradiation from the outbursting accretion disk , thus giving rise to an enhanced mass - transfer from the secondary , which leads to a long - lasting superoutburst ( the best historical example of this application being @xcite ) .",
    "the other is an application of the disk - instability model , which , with an assumption of very low quiescent viscosity of the accretion disk , can produce the main characteristics of wz sge - type dwarf novae , namely the long outburst intervals and the absence of normal outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the required quiescent viscosity ( @xmath1 ) to reproduce such long outburst intervals has been shown to be extremely small ( @xmath2 : @xcite ; @xmath3 : @xcite ) .",
    "these values of the required quiescent viscosity has usually been considered too small for a disk with a developed magneto - rotational instability @xcite , although this problem is recently becoming more positively resolved by considering a suppression of this instability in a cold disk with a low electric conductivity @xcite .",
    "the apparent difficulty with the low quiescent viscosity has historically invoked modifications of the disk - instability model exemplified by the truncated inner disk @xcite .",
    "this model supposed a cold steady state - solution during quiescence , and a slight variation in mass - transfer rate was supposed to be the cause of infrequent outbursts . @xcite",
    "proposed another possibility of the magnetically truncated disk .",
    "although these truncated disks were successful in reproducing one of the characteristics of wz sge - type dwarf novae ( the long recurrence time ) , these models with a high @xmath1 ( @xmath0 0.01 ) have been shown by @xcite to meet difficulties in reproducing long - lasting superoutbursts .",
    "although there have been attempts ( e.g. @xcite ) to reproduce long outbursts by considering an enhanced mass - transfer during superoutbursts , the resultant light curve is very different from observation .",
    "furthermore , the supposed observational evidence for an enhanced mass - transfer is excluded by later careful analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition to these outburst properties , wz sge - type dwarf novae are shown to have other properties common to all members , but are absent in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "one is the presence of _ early superhumps _ during the earliest stage of superoutbursts of wz sge - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "the early superhumps have a stable period almost identical with the orbital period [ during the best observed 2001 superoutburst of wz sge , the period of the early superhumps was reported to be very slightly shorter than the orbital period @xcite ] .",
    "this feature was historically first detected and described in wz sge itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , although the origin of this variation was not properly discussed or identified at this time .",
    "the common existence of early superhumps among wz sge - type dwarf novae has been progressively confirmed : al com ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , hv vir ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rz leo ( @xcite ) , and the main focus of this paper , eg cnc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the other is occasional  dips \" ( transient fading episodes lasting for one to several days ) during the later stage of superoutburst , which was first clearly described in the 1978 outburst of wz sge ( e.g. @xcite ) , and was repeated in the 1995 outburst of al com ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite repoeted that the stage after the dip phenomenon shares the characteristics common to superoutbursts of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae : the presence of a likely precursor and the subsequent growth of usual superhumps . from these findings ,",
    "the 1977 - 1978 outburst of wz sge and the 1995 outburst of al com were interpreted as ",
    "double superoutbursts \" @xcite.http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / mail / alert1000/msg00195.html@xmath4 . ]    an argument naturally rises why such a sequence of superoutburst can be only realized in wz sge - type dwarf novae . a naive explanation may be a consequence of enhanced - mass transfer , but is rather difficult to reconcile considering the low proper angular momentum of the  fresh \" transferred matter , accumulation of which will more easily produce normal outbursts than a second superoutburst .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite instead suggested a possibility of the cooling and heating waves originating before the termination of the entire superoutburst .",
    "@xcite presented observational evidence in al com that the second superoutburst was triggered by a short outburst , which , from the absence of superhumps , was attributed to a normal outburst as seen in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "independent observations during the second ( super)outburst are critically needed to confirm the universality of the claimed observational features , and to explain the unique outburst pattern of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "on 1996 november 30 , an alert ( vsnet - alert 599 ) through the vsnet alert system @xcite notifying a bright outburst of the suspected wz sge - type star , http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / mail / vsnet - alert/ + msg00599.html@xmath4 and @xmath5http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / dne / egcnc.html@xmath4 . ]",
    "eg cnc @xcite announced the opening of a new story .",
    "eg cnc was originally discovered by @xcite from his photographic archive on the occasion of an outburst in 1977 .",
    "subsequent searches for other photographic materials between 1977 and 1983 , and searches for further outbursts by huruhata himself and a number of amateur astronomers have yielded a null result until 1995 .",
    "@xcite correctly identified the quiescent counterpart on palomar sky survey prints , and suggested from its marked blue color and the apparent low frequency of outbursts that this object is similar to the dwarf nova wz sge .    upon the alert by schmeer , we started time - resolved ccd photometry using telescopes at osaka kyoiku university ( oku ) and ouda station @xcite , kyoto university .",
    "the initial results proving the existence of early superhumps ( @xmath6 d ) and the subsequent development of usual superhumps ( @xmath7 d ) were already discussed in our earlier paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss mainly on its peculiar late - stage phenomenon , particularly focusing on repetitive rebrightenings .",
    "the methods of observation and reduction were the same as in @xcite .",
    "the observations at osaka kyoiku university were carried out using the 50-cm telescope at the cassegrain focus ( focal length @xmath8 ) equipped with an astromed eev  88200 ccd camera ( @xmath9 pixels ) and a @xmath10-band filter .",
    "the observations at ouda station were carried out using the 60-cm telescope at the cassegrain focus ( focal length @xmath11 ) equipped with a thomson th  7882 ccd camera ( @xmath12 pixels ) .",
    "we used an interference filter designed to reproduce the johnson @xmath10 band .",

    "the frames obtained at osaka kyoiku university were reduced using the iraf .",
    "the frames obtained at ouda station were reduced with a microcomputer - based automatic aperture and psf photometry packages developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "we used gsc 1948.1452 ( @xmath10 = 12.82 ) as the local comparison star , whose constancy during the observation was confirmed to 0.01 mag using the check star gsc 1948.1193 ( @xmath10 = 13.86 ) .",

    "the outburst thus started some time between november 22 and 30 .",
    "the existence of early superhumps @xcite , which are known to rapidly decay within several days of the maximum light of a wz sge - type superoutburst , and the recorded maximum brightness ( @xmath16 = 11.8 ) close to that of the 1977 outburst , suggest that the detection by schmeer was made within a few days of the start of the outburst .    the main superoutburst lasted until december 15 ( hjd 2450433 ) , followed by a precipitous decline .",

    "although there was a suggestion of two rebrightenings after the 1994 superoutburst of another wz sge - type candidate , uz boo @xcite , , such a large number of repetitive brightenings had been never observed in any dwarf novae until this outburst of eg cnc .",

    "although whether or not this small brightening can be treated in the same context of other ( major ) rebrightenings is an open question , the slow rising stage of this small brightening was more analogous to the sixth rebrightening , possibly implying the common underlying mechanism .",

    "the sixth rebrightening may be related to the former ,  slow \" rebrightening .",
    "since the disk instability theory predicts the cycle length of normal outbursts , for a certain range of parameters , is roughly inversely proportional to the mass - transfer rate ( e.g. @xcite ) , it would be natural to attribute the increased outburst activity after the main superoutburst to an enhanced mass - transfer somehow caused by the superoutburst .",
    "since the measured short outburst intervals ( 510 d ) are one of the shortest even among frequently outbursting su uma - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , this interpretation would require ( assuming no change in other parameters before and after the superoutburst ) a mass - transfer rate something between ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae and er uma stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the er uma stars are peculiar su uma - type stars which are proposed to have mass - transfer rates several times higher than in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the initial pattern and amplitudes of rebrightenings of eg cnc closely resembled those of er uma stars , the enhanced mass - transfer and the enhanced hot spot brightness would not solely by themselves explain the later behavior , since the brightness of the system was shown to decrease gradually ( see figure [ fig : vis ] ) , even after the sixth rebrightening .",
    "this smooth decrease in brightness should require _ smoothly decreasing _ frequency of rebrightenings , which is contrary to the observation if the system brightness actually reflects the brightness of the hot spot or the mass - transfer rate .",
    "@xcite instead proposed a model to reproduce these rebrightenings , by assuming increased quiescent viscosity after the main superoutburst .",
    "this model , by adjusting the time dependence of the quiescent viscosity and its radial dependence through the disk , could at least reproduce the observed rebrightenings without an assumption of an enhanced mass - transfer .",
    "@xcite originally suggested that such increased quiescent viscosity is somehow related to the turbulent motion in the disk resulting from the tidal instability .",
    "they also proposed the extremely low mass - transfer rate in wz sge - type dwarf novae would be responsible for the slow circularization of the eccentric disk , leading to the slow decrease in the quiescent viscosity after the outburst and multiple rebrightenings never seen in usual dwarf novae .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism for the decay of the disk viscosity has been recently proposed by @xcite by considering a decay of mhd turbulence under the condition of the low magnetic reynolds numbers in the cold accretion disk @xcite .",

    ", @xcite suggested that the stored disk material survives being depleted by accretion , owing to the low occurrence of normal outbursts in these systems .",
    "however , the degree of depletion of the disk mass during one supercycle is rather expected to affect the initial condition of superoutburst , but not necessarily that of the late - stage condition of superoutburst .",
    "as @xcite has shown , the late stage of wz sge - type superoutbursts is expected to follow the same time - evolution as those of usual dwarf novae .",
    "the initial excessive matter is effectively accreted on a viscous time - scale ; it is not still convincingly clear how the low occurrence of normal outbursts ( or its precondition ) naturally explains the unique late - stage phenomenon in wz sge - type superoutbursts .",
    "though the discussion was more limited to sxts , @xcite could reproduce a similar pattern of rebrightenings by modifying the radial dependence of the @xmath31 viscosity .",
    "this model , however , would suffer , as in the model proposed by @xcite , from the depletion of high - angular momentum matter necessary to invoke an immediate second superoutburst .",
    "we alternately consider a possibility that the matter in the outer accretion disk may be left from being accreted during the main superoutburst , by way of the premature quenching of the hot state in the outer disk .",
    "we propose the weaker turbulence and resultant heating caused by the weaker tidal instability in the outer disk than in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae can be responsible for this possibility .",
    "this weaker tidal torque can be reasonably achieved under conditions of extreme mass ratios in wz sge - type dwarf novae , which can hold the 3:1 resonance radius well inside the roche lobe of the primary , or the maximum dimension of the expanded disk .",
    "this possibility was originally proposed in 1997 by @xcite and @xcite , which was further explored by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the unusual presence of na d absorption line @xcite could be attributed to the cool reservoir in the disk required by this interpretation .",
    "superoutbursts in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae are believed to be triggered when the disk radius , upon the ignition of the outburst , first reaches the radius of the 3:1 resonance during the normally outbursting cycle @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity wave @xcite caused by the tidal instability should naturally start in the outermost region of the disk , and should propagate inward , accounting for the general decrease in the superhump period during superoutbursts of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .    in wz sge - type dwarf novae ,",
    "however , the absence of normal outbursts may lead to an accumulation of a large amount of matter , leading to more violent expansion of the disk during superoutburst enabling the disk expanding beyond the 3:1 resonance .",
    "the above picture then predicts the eccentricity wave can propagate outward .",
    "the presence of positive period derivatives of superhump periods in some wz sge - type dwarf novae and infrequently outbursting , large - amplitude su uma - type dwarf novae ( e.g. al com : @xcite ; v1028 cyg : @xcite ; sw uma : @xcite ; @xcite ; hv vir : @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent summary of period derivatives in su uma - type dwarf novae ) would strengthen the idea of the relative difference in the location of generation and propagation of tidal instability between wz sge - type and ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the extremely low mass - ratios in wz sge - type dwarf novae could play the key role in generating tidal instability well inside the entire disk radius .",

    "<S> these findings suggest the superhumps observed during the rebrightening stage and the fading tail are a  remnant \" of usual superhumps , and are not newly triggered by rebrightenings . by comparison with the 1977 outburst of this object and outbursts of other wz sge - type dwarf novae </S>",

    "<S> the post - superoutburst behavior of wz sge - type dwarf novae can be understood in the presence of considerable amount of remnant matter behind the cooling front in the outer accretion disk , even after the main superoutburst . </S>",
