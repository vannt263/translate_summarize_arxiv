    "extragalactic jets are thought to play an important role in providing a heating mechanism in the center of cool core ( cc ) clusters of galaxies .",

    "the cooling times in the dense core of some cc clusters are much shorter than the hubble time .    as a consequence of the short cooling times",

    "non - gravitational energy input into cc clusters seems to be necessary to solve this , the so called `` cooling flow '' , problem .",
    "this energy input is most likely self - regulated , since it should provide sufficient heat to quench the cooling , but at the same time it should not be so strong as to overheat and destroy the cool core .",
    "the most likely sources providing the sufficient heating to prevent the intracluster gas from runaway cooling are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) located at the center of cc clusters @xcite , but the exact physical mechanism which distributes that heat is still not known .",
    "recent high resolution observations indicate that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at the center of cc clusters of galaxies generate hot bubbles , jets , shocks , and turbulence in the icg ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "jets have been suggested as the main source of energy input from agns into the icg .",

    "more recently , @xcite demonstrated that momentum - driven agn feedback and star formation can prevent the cooling catastrophe producing self - regulated cycles of accretion by the central supermassive black hole , which heats the gas , followed by gas cooling until the next cycle .",
    "this model is mainly consistent with most observations ( but , e.g. , occasionally , it does produce higher star formation rate and cooling rate than observations imply ) .",

    "[ f : projyenerall ] the first jet with fixed mach number ( m@xmath60 ) is moving left to right , the second jet , with different velocities , is moving in the opposite direction .",
    "in the first column in figures  [ f : projzenerall ] and [ f : projyenerall ] we show jet collisions with zero impact parameter ( p = 0 ) . in all these cases",
    "only one jet seems to emerge after the collision ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .",
    "however , because of symmetry , after the collision these jets are somewhat spread out in the out - of - collision - plane direction ( @xmath32 ; see figure  [ f : projyenerall ] ) .    in most of those cases where we adopted a finite impact parameter ( p @xmath61 )",
    ", two jets can be seen after the collision . as a consequence of the large velocities , the jets bounce off each other and survive as individuals ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) . in figure",
    "[ f : projzenerall ] we can see that after the collision , the jets show increasing instabilities as the impact parameter is decreased , and in some cases , as a result of growing instabilities , the jets break up into oscillating filaments .    after the collision the two jets still propagate in roughly the same plane ( see figure  [ f : projyenerall ] ) , but the plane is rotated relative to the horizontal direction by an angle which is larger for smaller impact parameters and larger velocity differences between the two jets .    in those cases when the second jet is much slower than the first , the two jets may merge , and the bending angle after collision of the slower jet is larger for higher velocity differences between the two jets ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .",
    "based on our results , we can classify colliding jets into two categories : ( 1 ) bouncing and ( 2 ) merging jets .",
    "we illustrate the difference between these two categories in the first and second columns in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] . in this figure",
    "we display the total energy density , scaled entropy per particle ( @xmath62 ) , enstrophy , @xmath63 ( see section  [ ss : enstrophy ] ) , and helicity , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the vorticity , @xmath66 , projected to the @xmath28 plane ( from top to bottom , first two columns ) .",
    "the first column illustrates bouncing of two fast jets with v@xmath67 v@xmath51@xmath49 , and a large impact parameter , p = 0.8 ( model p080v18 ) ; the second column shows projections of a merging jet simulation with a small impact parameter , p = 0.3 , and large velocity difference : v@xmath68@xmath49vs .",

    "the jets propagate from left to right .",
    "the point of collision is in the middle of the left hand side of the energy panels marked with red ( see top left panel for each simulation ) .",
    "it can be seen clearly from figure  [ f : test3356projz ] that , after the collision , the bouncing jets ( 1st column ) keep their identities and travel relatively unaffected , while , in the case of merging jets , after the collision , the faster jet absorbs the slower jet , although not instantly ( 2nd column ) .",
    "we quantify the effect of jet collisions by projecting the total energy density of the system to the @xmath28 plane , @xmath70 , and measuring the spread of @xmath70 along a line parallel to the @xmath31 axis ( i.e , along a vertical line in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) at a distance of 15 kpc from the collision point ( @xmath71 $ ] ) , and identify the two regimes of the parameter space resulting in bouncing and merging jets . in figure",
    "[ f : qphasediagram ] we plot the width of the projected total energy density where it is @xmath72 5% of its maximum value ( @xmath71 \\ge 0.05 \\times { \\rm max}\\{e_{z}[15,y]\\}$ ] ) in a grid of impact parameter ( 0 @xmath73 p @xmath74 ) and the velocity of the second jet ( expressed as the mach number , 4.4 @xmath55 ) . the black - blue - green - orange - red colors represent increasing spread of the jet .",
    "when the jets merge the spread is limited because the second jet disappears ( black and dark blue color pixels ) .",
    "a trend can be seen clearly in figure  [ f : qphasediagram ] : the spread increases as the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet increases .",
    "the jets merge when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small ( magenta and dark blue pixels ; p000v10 , p000v12 , p000v14 , p015v10 , p015v12 , and p030v10 , see table  [ t : table1 ] ) , otherwise they bounce . since the @xmath31 components of the velocities of the jets have opposite signs , the relative value of this component decreases ( it should be zero for v@xmath75 = v@xmath76 ) , and , as a consequence , the angle between the bouncing jets decreases as does the spread between them .",
    "this is the reason for the increasing spread with increasing impact parameter ( left to right in figure  [ f : qphasediagram ] ) .",
    "even though both jets propagate in the positive @xmath27 direction , the @xmath27 component of the velocities of both jets decreases because , as they collide , they generate more turbulence and drive more waves as they propagate due to the increased instabilities .      in general ,",
    "as the jets propagate in the ambient medium , instabilities are generated due to the kelvin - helmholtz process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the form of the instabilities depends on the thickness of the contact layer between the jet and the ambient medium .",
    "near the origin of the jet the transition zone is thin , and the vortex sheet approximation can be used assuming large density and velocity gradients .",
    "farther from the origin , the contact layer extends due to matter entrainment , turbulence and other non - linear effects .",
    "there are two main types of instability in jets : the surface modes , which have steeply decreasing amplitude as a function of the distance from the jet surface , and reflected body modes , which affect the entire gas in the jet .",
    "reflection modes dominate if m@xmath77 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the jet mach numbers in our hydrodynamical simulations range from 4.4 to 7.9 , therefore we expect the reflection modes to dominate .",
    "the wavelengths of the reflection modes can be estimated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the characteristic cross section of the jet . in our case , @xmath80 kpc .",
    "our simulations show long wavelength oscillations along the jets with wavelengths in the range of 10 - 20 kpc , which is compatible to the expected wavelength of the reflection modes .    in the 3rd column in figure",
    "[ f : test3356projz ] we show the total energy projected to the @xmath28 plane from our colliding jet simulations with fixed jet velocities : v@xmath75 = v@xmath51@xmath49 , but different impact parameters : p = 0.5 , 1 , 1.3 , and with p = @xmath81 representing two non - interacting pairs of jets ( top to bottom ; models : p045v18 , p100v18 , p130v18 , and sngv18 ) . in the case of non - interacting jets ( see bottom panel in the 3rd column ) , linear instabilities grow non - linear only after the jets travel about 20 kpc .",
    "however , it can be seen from the 3rd column in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] that the instabilities are enhanced in colliding jets and they grow non - linear soon or immediately after the collision ( see 1st , 2nd and 3rd panels ) .",
    "as we increase the impact parameter , the instabilities decrease ( top to bottom in the 3rd column ; see also the trend from left to right in the different columns in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .",
    "the jets in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] do not seem to expand where they meet , therefore the jets in our simulations with p = 1 and 1.3 do not actually collide .",
    "however , interestingly , comparing the 2nd and 3rd panels ( p = 1 and 1.3 ) in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] with the last panel ( p = @xmath81 ) , we notice that the two jets still interact with each other via turbulence , which enhances the instabilities and generates oscillations traveling down the jets .    studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", we notice that in some cases the jets break into filaments due to instabilities ( e.g. , mo dels p080v18 , p100v18 , and sngv18 , columns 4 , 5 , and 6 top panels , and models p100v10 , and sngv10 , columns 5 and 6 bottom panels in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .",
    "our simulations show that , in general , filaments form in jets only far from the source ( @xmath8230 kpc ) unless the collision is strong , i.e , the impact parameter is small ( e.g. , models p045v18 and p080v18 ; compare top panels in columns 4 and 6 ) .",
    "however , filaments of this form are not frequently seen in radio images of extragalactic jets , which is most likely due to the fact that the jets usually reach lower - pressure regions in the ambient medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop .",
    "the effect of interaction between jets due to turbulence generated by collision can be quantified using the enstrophy density , the mean squared vorticity , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the vorticity at position @xmath85 ( note that , occasionally , it is defined without the 1/2 factor ) . in figure",

    "is increased , while the enstrophy peak drops significantly at @xmath86 , as the jet centers become separated by more than one jet radius .",

    "small impact parameters , @xmath92 , result in large enstrophy maxima , @xmath93 , in the transition region around @xmath94 , the enstrophy drops to about half of this value , and for large impact parameters , @xmath95 , the maximum is @xmath96 .",
    "a likely explanation for this `` phase transition '' is the following . at the collision region of the two jets ,",
    "the jets slightly oscillate in direction as a result of the growing kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "these oscillations induce a change in the jet gas mass involved directly in the collision by changing the collision cross section .",
    "the larger the changes in the mass involved in the collision , the more turbulence is generated driving more shock waves into the ambient medium resulting larger enstrophy maxima .",
    "the change in the mass involved in the collision is larger for small impact parameters , generating more turbulence .",
    "as we increase the impact parameter , the change in the jet gas mass due to the oscillations of the jets drops at around p @xmath97 , and , as a consequence , the amount of turbulence and thus the enstrophy maximum are also reduced significantly .",
    "as the jets are plunging through the ambient gas , their bulk kinetic energy dissipates into shocks and turbulence , and , as a result , they slow down . the dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy into turbulent energy can be quantified using the enstrophy density .",

    "the ram pressure from a medium in transverse relative motion to the jet is the most common reason why jets show large - scale bends .",
    "the smooth changes in the direction of the jets in 3c 75 farther from their agns are due to the relative movement of the agns to the ambient medium .",
    "the direction of the bending of the jets ( towards north - east ) suggests that 3c 75 is moving to the south - west .",
    "the eastern jet of the northern agn seems to bend suddenly to the north about 25 kpc east of the core , where an enhancement can be seen in the x - ray emission @xcite , perhaps because of an encounter with a denser gas cloud in the intergalactic medium , or with the atmosphere of a galaxy .",
    "however , the western jet from the northern agn , after traveling about 15 kpc from its source , bends to the north by about 45@xmath40where its path crosses that of the northern jet of the southern agn .",
    "no x - ray enhancement associated with extra gas can be seen in this location and the southern agn seems to be propagating towards the north - west without changing its direction @xcite .",

    "the two filaments travel with a speed close to that of the faster jet and have no coherent rotational velocities perpendicular to their propagation , which would be necessary for helical motion . however , the filaments seem to have different helicities , coherent on the scale of a few kpc along their propagation direction , which may provide stability to these oscillating filaments ( right column in figure  [ f : roteneheli ] ) .",
    "our hydrodynamical simulations suggest a possible physical explanation for the morphology of 3c  75 .",
    "the slower northern jet from the northern agn collides with a small but finite impact parameter with the faster jet from the southern agn traveling towards north - west , the jets merge , and the faster jet takes over the slower jet ( most of the gas from the slower jet is grabbed by the faster jet ) .",
    "the helical - looking morphology is a projection effect : the faster jet breaks into filaments due to the enhanced instabilities caused by the collision with the slower jet .",
    "this explanation is consistent with all observed features of 3c  75 .",
    "we carried out hydrodynamical simulations to study extragalactic jet collisions . we found that colliding jets can be cast into two categories : bouncing and merging jets .",
    "we have shown that two fast jets colliding with non - zero impact parameter bounce off each other keeping their identities , but jets with very different velocities colliding with a small impact parameter merge into one jet , and the faster jet takes over the slower jet .",
    "we have found that the collision enhances the instabilities of the jets ; kpc scale oscillations are generated , and the jets may break up into filaments . in some projections , the filaments may show a twisted structure .    in general , magnetic fields in jets can reduce the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and , as a consequence , generate less turbulence , and can also affect the transport processes within the jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the collisions between fast jets included in our simulations are so energetic that we expect that the weak magnetic fields inferred from observations would affect neither the dynamics of the collisions significantly , nor our qualitative results on bouncing and merging of jets .",
    "our hydrodynamical simulations suggest a physical explanation for the twisted radio morphology of 3c 75 : strong instabilities are generated in the faster jet by the collision with a much slower jet with a small , but finite impact parameter .",
