    "pulsar b1913 + 16 was the first binary pulsar discovered @xcite .",
    "the system consists of two neutron stars ( one an observed pulsar ) orbiting in a very tight , highly eccentric orbit , and it remains one of the best for studying relativistic gravitation ( weisberg & taylor 1981 ; taylor & weisberg 1982 , 1989 ; and weisberg , nice , & taylor 2010 , hereafter wnt ) . in this paper , we update wnt with the addition of post-2006 data and with further relativistic timing analyses .",
    "the addition of significant quantities of data acquired with modern data - acquisition devices has enabled us to measure several additional relativistic phenomena for the first time in this system , while also refining previously - measured ones . among the parameters newly measured with various degrees of accuracy",
    "are the shapiro gravitational propagation delay , a relativistic correction to the elliptical orbital shape , and the time derivative of projected pulsar semimajor axis .",
    "all of the the data used in this study are published with this paper , while our analysis software is published in an online repository .",
    "we describe the observations used in this work in  [ sec : data ] , while  [ sec : relanaly ] delineates the scope and methods of our relativistic analyses of these data .",
    "the results of our fits to the data are explained in  [ sec : results ] , and their applications for tests of relativistic gravitation are discussed in  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : concl ] by summarizing our work and placing it in the context of results from other relativistic binary pulsar systems .",
    "the data for our analyses consists of 9257 pulse times of arrival ( toas ) derived from five - minute integrations of the pulsar signal at frequencies near 1400 mhz measured at arecibo observatory from 1981 - 2012 .",
    "the parameters of the various observing systems and the number of toas from each through epoch 2006 are tabulated in wnt ; wapp spectrometer observations since then have added another 1652 toas to the total , each acquired by three wapps deployed simultaneously at approximately contiguous 100-mhz bands near 1400 mhz .",
    "geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis has induced pulse profile changes @xcite that have lately grown increasingly larger , presumably as our line of sight approaches the edge of the pulsar beam .",
    "nevertheless , for purposes of uniformity , we use only a single profile template while finding toas for all wapp data .",
    "this procedure induces time offsets into our toa dataset between different sessions and frequencies , which have grown to a level where they should be compensated for . to do so",
    ", we adopted the following process .",
    "first , we formed a pulse profile at each frequency band for each two - week session .",
    "each resulting `` session - band '' standard profile has much greater @xmath4 than does a single five - minute integration , while still being short enough to avoid the secular changes we are trying to measure .",
    "next , we measured the offset of the midpoint of this session - band standard profile with respect to the grand standard profile .",
    "( the midpoint is assumed to correspond to a fixed longitude on the pulsar regardless of profile shifts ) .",
    "then we fitted out a `` primary '' linear model of the profile offsets as a function of time at each band . in this fashion",
    ", we provided an empirically determined , model independent , first - order toa correction that accounts for the effects of profile changes , thereby minimizing the long - term effects of profile shifts that might be mistaken as the signature of other phenomena .",
    "we next fitted the timing model to all such `` primarily - offsetted '' toas and chose the resulting dispersion measure as our nominal value .",
    "finally , secondary offsets were determined through single session fits , where the dispersion measure was fixed at its nominal value and the residual offset of each band was fitted for and then removed .",
    "this process ensures that the infinite - frequency toas calculated from each band and session are self - consistently de - dispersed and offsetted .    to verify that the above profile - variation - correction process does not contaminate our parameter measurements",
    ", we also employed an alternate approach , fitting for an offset for each band in each session simultaneously with all other parameters @xcite .",
    "this procedure yields parameters that agree with our method to within 1@xmath5 for all parameters , suggesting that our measurements are robust with respect to the methods used to remove profile - shift - induced timing offsets .",
    "using an augmented version of the tempo software program , we fitted the relativistic timing model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dd ) ; or , in certain cases , the dd model augmented by the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fw ) shapiro parametrization ( see  [ sec : fitting ] ) , to our toas . in these models ,",

    "for the first time , we have successfully fitted for the shapiro ( 1964 ) gravitational propagation delay while also placing constraints on two additional ones : a relativistic correction to the quasi - elliptical shape of the orbit and the shrinkage rate of its projected semimajor axis , as described further below .",

    "the newly fitted post - keplerian parameters include the following : ( i ) two shapiro delay terms called shape @xmath21 and range @xmath22 in the dd parametrization , or two ( different ) quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the alternate fw parametrization ; ( ii ) the orbital elliptical shape correction parameter @xmath25 ( to our knowledge never previously fitted for in any binary system ) , which appears in dt92 s full expression for eq .",

    "the two terms are identified as @xmath21 and @xmath22 in dd ; while fw recently developed an alternate parametrization of the phenomenon , wherein their two fitted parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are orthonormal .",
    "our software implementation of their parametrization for high - eccentricity pulsars is available in our augmented version of tempo.@xmath30 the measurements of either pair of shapiro parameters , @xmath31 or @xmath32 , can be utilized in either of two different manners , as described below .",
    "first , if general relativity is assumed to be the correct theory of gravitation , then either pair of shapiro measurables can be utilized as independent constraints on the orbital inclination and binary companion mass .",

    "the alternate fw parametrization of the shapiro delay gives @xmath40 while @xmath34 is a combination of the two measurables @xmath41 : @xmath42    alternatively , each measured parameter of the shapiro pair can be considered to be an independent test of relativistic gravitation .",

    "[ eqn : deltas ] , resulting from aberration of the rotating pulsar beam , is dependent on the time - variable transverse component of the pulsar s orbital velocity .",

    "while the above equations provide a complete description of the calculation of @xmath44 at any proper emission time , dd and dt92 also provide an alternate approach that focuses on aberration parameters that change slowly ( on precession timescales ) as a result of spin - axis precession .",
    "this procedure , detailed below , is more closely tailored to parameters determinable from toa analyses .",
    "dt92 show that aberration will bias the observed value of the relativistic orbital shape parameter @xmath25 with respect to its intrinsic value @xmath54 : @xmath55 where the small parameter @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57    hence the observational bias can be removed , given measurements of the aberration parameter @xmath45 and the keplerian quantity @xmath28 . the corrected value @xmath58 could then serve as an additional test of gravitation theory .",
    "in addition to affecting @xmath59 , dt92 show that aberration also affects the observed @xmath28 and @xmath15 values . however , the fractional corrections to @xmath28 and @xmath15 are tiny .",
    "more interesting is the effect of geodetic spin - axis precession on the time - derivatives of these parameters , because dt92 show that they are potentially measurable .",

    "the uncertainties quoted therein represent the standard errors from the tempo fit ( except as noted ) .",
    "this convention differs from our previous practice , wherein many uncertainties were instead estimated from fitted parameter variations across multiple reasonable fits . while the old procedure facilitated the incorporation of some systematic uncertainties into the error budget ; the more stable recent instrumental configurations appear to minimize such effects .",
    "some of the fitted parameters shifted by several @xmath5 with respect to the values reported in @xcite .",
    "the shifts can all be attributed to the new incorporation of a frequency and time offset for each wapp observing session and center frequency in order to account for geodetic - precession - induced profile changes ( see  [ sec : data ] ) , and to our new procedure of fitting for rather than freezing at 0 the parameter @xmath74 .",

    "in addition to confirming general relativistic radiation damping at this level , our result rules out large parameter spaces in plausible scalar - tensor theories of gravity . in recent years , however , other pulsars in neutron star - white dwarf binary systems have overtaken psr b1913 + 16 in constraining these alternatives @xcite .    dd92 point out that this test is a `` mixed '' strong - field probe in that it involves a combination of radiative effects ( via @xmath159 ) and quasi - static phenomena ( through @xmath97 and @xmath19 , whose values are needed in order to make a prediction of the expected @xmath160 ) . consequently , additional tests , such as those described in the next section , that probe different aspects of strong - field gravitation , are also useful in constraining viable alternatives to general relativity .",
    "each of the two newly measured shapiro parameters represents another independent test of relativistic gravitation . as with the @xmath161 test of  [ sec",
    ": gravrad ] , the shapiro tests also require the complementary measurement of @xmath97 and @xmath19 in order to make a testable prediction for the value of the shapiro parameters . in this case , unlike the @xmath161 test , all of the post - keplerian quantities probe quasi - static phenomena in strong fields . while shapiro parameters have already been measured in several other binary systems , it is especially useful to constrain theories via systems such as this one and psrs b1534 + 12 and j0737 - 3039a , where at least three `` excess '' post - keplerian parameters beyond @xmath97 and @xmath19 ( one gravitational radiation parameter and two shapiro quantities ) are measurable . although the precision of the binary pulsar shapiro parameter measurements is well below their measurement precision in the weak solar gravitational field , it is this simultaneous determination of several parameters in strong - field conditions in each of these binary pulsar systems that leads to the important constraints on relativistic theories of gravitation .    in the dd formulation of the shapiro delay within general relativity ,",
    "the shapiro measurables @xmath21 and @xmath22 map directly onto @xmath33 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "hence we can test general relativity by comparing the shapiro determination of @xmath163 with that determined from @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( called @xmath164 ; see  [ sec : bestmasses ] ) : @xmath165 similarly , we can test general relativity by comparing the shapiro determination of @xmath166 ) with that determined from @xmath18 and @xmath19 :    @xmath167    the consistency ( albeit with a rather low level of precision ) of these shapiro determinations of @xmath33 and @xmath162 with those measured via the other post - keplerian terms , and hence their confirmation of general relativity , is also graphically depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : massmass ] .",
    "the shapiro terms have also been measured in several other binary pulsar systems with higher precision , and have also been shown to be in agreement with general relativity .",
    "we report here on the measurements and relativistic analyses of 9309 toas in over thirty years of high - quality arecibo data on binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "we fitted for a number of previously unmeasurable parameters for the first time in this system ( and in one case , for the first time anywhere ) , which enabled us to significantly advance our relativistic analyses of the system .",
    "we provide our newest measurents or derivations of all relevant physical quantities of the binary system , with the exception of @xmath72 , the position angle of the line of nodes .",
    "we rigorously ascertained the uncertainties in the fitted and derived parameters .",
    "having fully characterized the system , we proceeded to use it in several tests of general relativity in strong - field conditions .",
    "we have measured a gravitational radiation - induced orbital period decrease whose rate agrees with the general relativistic expectation to within @xmath156 , which is closer than found by wnt , largely as a result of an improved galactic correction resulting from more accurate galactic parameters @xcite .",

    "our new ( for this system ) measurements of shapiro gravitational propagation delay parameters represent two additional tests of relativistic gravitation , and are fully consistent with general relativity , although their relative precision is currently far lower than the orbital decay test .",
