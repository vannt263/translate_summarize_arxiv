    "theoretical study of the space - time evolution of matter in high energy nuclear collisions has a long history since the early pioneering works of fermi and landau employing thermodynamics and fluid mechanics  @xcite .",
    "more recent works  @xcite have been motivated by the prospect of studying a new form of matter experimentally by means of very energetic collisions of heavy nuclei as those currently underway at brookhaven with relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and planned at cern with large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the data taken from the rhic experiments has shown existence of a strong anisotropic ( elliptic ) collective flow of hadrons in non - central collisions  @xcite , indicating early local equilibration of dense matter produced by the collision  @xcite .",
    "this supports the hydrodynamic picture of matter evolution and gives us a hope to learn information of the equation of state of dense matter from systematic analyses of the data .",
    "much attention has been paid to the early stage of matter evolution where a dense plasma of unconfined quarks and gluons has been expected to be formed through some complex non - equilibrium processes  @xcite .",
    "one anticipates also a breakdown of the hydrodynamic behavior of the system when it is diluted sufficiently and the collision time exceeds the characteristic time scale of expansion .",
    "this stage of the matter evolution is usually refered to as the freezeout stage .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a kinetic theory which is designed to describe the freezeout stage of the expanding hadron gas .",
    "the freezeout of the expanding hadronic matter would proceed in several steps ; chemical freezeout of the relative abandunce of hadron spieces may occur before the kinetic freezeout of the momentum distribution of hadrons .",
    "observed relative abandunce of hadrons fit very nicely to a simple picture that the chemical freezeout occurs at a certain temperature and baryon chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "some of the other observables , such as two particle momentum correlations , the pion analogue of the hanbury brown and twiss two photon intensity interferometry , may be very sensitive to the dynamics of the final kinetic freezeout as indicated by the  hbt puzzle \" found in the recent data analysis  @xcite .",
    "if the initial state of the dense matter formed in the collision is a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons , freezeout of the color degrees of freedom should proceed these processes when the quark - gluon plasma hadronizes .",
    "chiral symmmetry  @xcite , an approximate global symmetry of qcd which becomes exact in the limit of vanishing quark masses and is considered to be broken spontaneously in the qcd vacuum , may also play an important role in the freezeout dynamics .    as a dense hadronic matter formed by ultrarelativistic nuclear collision",
    "is diluted by the expansion , one expects that the system undergoes a phase transition associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry which is restored temporalily after the collision by the formation of a quark - gluon plasma . as the quark - gluon plasma hadronizes and the system turns into the confining phase ,",
    "the system would gradually develop a vacuum chiral condensate and remaining excitaions would expand in the influence of the growing chiral condensate .",
    "this physical picture has been elaborated in terms of a classical equation of motion for the chiral condensate ; effects of excitations were described in terms of statistical fluctuations in the classical fields  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuating condensate described by classical pion field has been termed disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) , emphasizing the symmetry aspect of the problem  @xcite .",
    "what was missing in these classical treatments of the meson fields is the existence of particle excitations in addition to the condensate .",
    "inclusion of particle excitations requires the quantization of the fields .",
    "the effect of the quantum fluctuations of meson fields has been studied by tsue , vautherin and one of the present authors ( tm ) @xcite by the functional schrdinger picture formalism @xcite .",
    "the physical picture we have described is very similar to what happens when the dilute gas of magnetically trapped atoms of alkali metals cools down by evapolation @xcite .",
    "some of the atoms condense into the lowest single particle level in the trapping external potential forming a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the dynamics of such a system may be described by the coupled equations of motion for the condensate , or the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , and the kinetic equation , or the boltzmann - vlasov equations , for the phase space distribution of the excitations in the presence of the condensate  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that a similar set of equations can be derived for a system of interacting mesons described by the relativistic quantum field theory by the mean field approximation .",
    "this approximation corresponds to a neglect of all correlations in the system  @xcite .",
    "we will make no attempt in this work to justify this approximation and leave it as an open problem for further study .    in this context",
    "we note that field theoretical derivation of a boltzmann - type kinetic equation has been given by many others  @xcite .",
    "most of these works focuses on the derivation of the collision terms . the present work is distinguished from these works in the emphasis of the role of the mean field in the evolution of the system coupled with the quasi - particle excitations in the same spirit as in @xcite .",
    "we omit the effect of the quasi - particle collisions in this work",
    ". this procedure may be reasonable , at least as a first step , for describing dynamical aspect of the freeze - out process : even in the absence of collisions , interactions between the quasi - particles and the evolving condensate would affect the final particle distribution . but the present approach is not adequate , however , for the early thermalization problem , where the collision terms play essential role  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the standard heisenberg picture instead of the functional schrdinger picture used in @xcite since we found it more straightforward to see the connection to familiar semi - classical kinetic equation .",
    "in this first of a series of papers we shall use one - component real scalar field model interacting via a @xmath0 self - interaction term in order to concentrate on the presentation of the basic features of the theory .",
    "analysis with multi - component scalar model with @xmath1 symmetry will be deferred for the forthcoming paper  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we formulate a quantum kinetic theory for quantum scalar meson field , starting from the heisenberg equations for quantum field of one - component real scalar .",
    "the mean field approximation replaces the products of quantum fields by the products of classical fields and the statistical average of bilinear forms of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the latter is expressed in terms of the wigner functions which is reduced to the single particle distribution function in the classical boltzmann equation .",
    "our theory contains another forms of the wigner functions which have no classical counter parts and arises due to the coherent pair creation and annihilation processes in non - uniform systems . only in uniform systems , these _ off - diagonal _ components of the fluctuation",
    "can be eliminated by suitable redefinition of the particle mass .",
    "appearance of the off - diagonal wigner functions is reminiscent of the anomalous propagators in the microscopic theory of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "similar structure also appears in the theory of bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "some details of the mean field calculation is given in appendix .",
    "in section 3 , we apply our method to uniform systems and show that each mode characterized by the particle momentum obeys non - linear forced oscillatory motion . in section 4",
    "we show that in equilibrium these kinetic equations are reduced to a gap equation  @xcite which determine the equilibrium amplitude of the condensate and the mass parameter as a function of the temperature . in this paper",
    ", we ignore the effect of the divergent vacuum polarizations which requires a subtle renormalization procedure in the mean field approximation  @xcite .",
    "the solution exhibits characteristic features of the first order phase transition .    in section 5 , we study slowly varying non - uniform systems . taking long wavelength approximation , the equations of motion of the diagonal components of the wigner functions",
    "are reduced to a vlasov equation in a form generalized by landau for quasi - particles excitations in quantum fermi liquid  @xcite with the quasi - particle energy given in the mean field approximation .",
    "non - vanishing off - diagonal components of the wigner functions generate extra terms in the vlasov equation which may be interpreted as particle source and sink terms .    in section 6 ,",
    "we compute the dispersion relations of excitations of the system near equilibrium . solving the coupled kinetic equations by linearizing the equations with respect to small oscillatory deviations from equilibrium solution we obtain dispersion relation of the excitation modes in the system near equilibrium .",
    "we find the continuum of quasi - particle excitations in the entire space - like energy - momentum region in addition to the continuum in time - like region due to the ( thermally induced ) pair creation .",
    "we found that in the low temperature phase the meson pole shifts due to the coupling to the quasi - particle continua .",
    "the effective meson mass vanishes at the edge of the spinodal instability line of the first order transition .",
    "meson mode has been studied first by hatsuda and kunihiro as a precursory phenomenon of the chiral phase transition using the nambu - jona - lasinio model with quark fields.@xcite ] we also found that the coupling of the off - diagonal components of the wigner function plays an important role to prevent appearance of undamped tachyonic sound mode which propagates with a velocity greater than that of light .",
    "a short summary of the paper is given in section 7 with remarks on the remaining problems .",
    "in this section we derive quantum kinetic equations which describes the time evolution of the meson condensate coupled with mesonic quasi - particle excitations .",
    "we use the natural unit @xmath2 throughout this paper .",
