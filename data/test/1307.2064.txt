    "dissolving the `` tragedy of the commons ''  @xcite is a central concern of studying cooperation in humans .",
    "numerous studies have been conducted applying the `` public goods '' game to study the problem of maintaining cooperation in a group of unrelated individuals .",
    "the society achieves its highest payoff if every individual contributes ; however , defector always gets more than cooperator . in typical examples ,",
    "the individual contributions are multiplied by a factor @xmath0 and then divided equally among all players . where @xmath0 is smaller than the group size , which is an example of a social dilemma  @xcite .",
    "although most of the people do not contribute zero to a common pool in the one - shot public goods game or in the initial stage of repeated public goods game , but the contributions usually decline over a few rounds  @xcite . vast experimental work on public goods game has focused on two different conditions which would lead to high contributions to the public pool , punishment  @xcite or / and reward  @xcite , and reputation  @xcite .",
    "however , christoph hauert et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out , reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are not repeated often enough or groups are too large .",
    "punishment and reward can be very effective but require that defectors must be traced and identified .    in 1993 , john m. orbell and robyn m. dawes  @xcite outlined a model of freedom to choose between playing and not playing particular prisoner s dilemma games and conducted experiments which showed that : ( 1 ) social welfare and the relative welfare of intending cooperators are higher when subjects are free to choose between entering and not entering particular prisoner s dilemma relationships ; and this difference is a consequence of intending cooperator s greater willingness to enter such relationship , not because of any capacity to recognize and avoid intending defectors . in 1995 , john batali and philip kitcher  @xcite also compared the evolution of altruism in optional and compulsory games . in their theoretical analysis , populations playing the compulsory game can become stuck in states of low cooperation that last many generations , while the optional games provide routes out of such states to states of high cooperation .",
    "and their computational simulations of the evolution of populations playing these games support their analytic results .",
    "christoph hauert et al .",
    "@xcite presented models introducing a third option named non - participation into public goods game .",
    "that means , people can either join the public goods game and then choose cooperate ( c ) , defect ( d ) , or refuse to participate in the game ( n ) .",
    "the game are denoted , hereafter , as ncd games .",
    "then a cycle of the three strategies , rock - paper - scissors type , is predicted .",
    "when cooperators are more frequent , defectors can exploit a large group of cooperators , whereas loners have the highest profit when defectors are frequent .",
    "when loners are most frequent , the public group size is reduced inviting cooperation because the game is no longer a dilemma in small groups  @xcite .",
    "hence , volunteering relaxes the social dilemma : instead of defectors winning the world , coexistence among cooperators , defectors and loners is expected@xcite .",
    "later , tatsuya sasaki et al .",
    "@xcite investigated punishment and reward effect in this public goods game .",
    "thus , nonparticipant as a natural mechanism is theoretically well studied , and the cyclic pattern in the full state space is clearly exhibited .",
    "dirk semmann et al .",
    "@xcite , following the above theoretical approach , conducted an experiment in which a sample group of 6 players was randomly chosen from a large population of 14 .",
    "they manipulated initial conditions and produced each predicted direction . by manipulating displayed decisions",
    ", it is pretended that if the defectors have the highest frequency , the loners soon become most frequent , as do the cooperators after the loners and defecators . on average ,",
    "cooperation is perpetuated at a substantial level .",
    "however , the results , based on the initial conditions they manipulated , did nt come out in the subsequent real experiment over 50 rounds .",
    "it is not clear , whether the rock - paper - scissors type strategy cycle exists in the real experiment or not .",
    "that means , in the perspective of evolution , the empirical cyclic dynamic pattern in the full state space has not been proved experimentally .    in this article , the mechanism in the optional public goods game",
    "is investigated experimentally , and first time , the cyclic strategy pattern in full state space is demonstrated by means of velocity .",
    "the remaining of this article is organized as follows : section two describes the experimental design and procedure ; section three demonstrates the results ; and the last discusses and concludes the results .",
    "the public goods game , which is employed here , is actually known as optional public goods game  @xcite .",
    "different with compulsory public goods game , there are three options , viz .",
    "cooperate ( c ) , defect ( d ) and refuse to participate in the game ( n ) , which are denoted , as ncd games .",
    "that means , the subject not willing to participate in the public goods game can choose n , but if he participates , he has two options , c and d. if only one person participates in the game , then , we think he will be equivalent to a loner .",
    "the public goods game starts only when two or more persons are there to participate in .",
    "the parameters used in our experiments are similar to that tatsuya sasaki et al .",
    "have used in their theoretical analysis  @xcite , where nonparticipation with intermittent cooperation bursts and form a rock - paper - scissors type cycle , n - c - d - n . from time to time , @xmath1 players are faced with an opportunity to participate in a public goods game .",
    "if the subject refuses to participate , and chooses n , he gets 0 , but if he decides to participate , he pays at a cost @xmath2 irrespective whether he chooses c or d. if the subject chooses c , then he will contribute a fixed amount @xmath3 , which will be be multiplied by @xmath4 and will distributed equally among all other participators of the group ( except himself ) . if the subject chooses d , he will contribute 0 and share the cooperator s contribution .",
    "the payoffs for cooperator , defector and nonparticipator are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively , and is given by :      where @xmath9 is the number of cooperators and @xmath10 is the number of defectors .",
    "therefore , if all subjects choose c , then each of them gets 1.5 ; if all subjects choose d , then each of them gets -0.5 ; the defector will always get additional ( @xmath11 ) than the cooperator only if there is a cooperator .",
    "so , social dilemma appears since the group will get the maximum payoff if all subjects choose c , however defector always gets more than cooperator .",
    "the nonparticipator will get 0 at all conditions .",
    "therefore , the option n provides an opportunity to escape the deadlock of defection .",
    "when n is frequent , cooperation is invited .",
    "again , once cooperator emerges , the defector will take advantage of cooperator .",
    "the rock - paper - scissors type strategy cycles are expected .      according to the evolutionary dynamics  @xcite , from time to time ,",
    "sample group of n players are randomly chosen from a large population and asked to participate in a single public goods game . following the theoretical research  @xcite and the experimental investigation  @xcite",
    ", we set a treatment in which , from time to time , a sample group of 5 players is randomly chosen from a large population of 13 . besides this , we add another treatment of a population size of 5 , that means the five players are fixed in a group and interact with each other from time to time .",
    "this setting allows us to investigate the population itself instead of sample group , and to trace the individual s behavior period by period .",
    "we call fixed group t1 and sample group t2 .      for treatment 1 , where the group is fixed ,",
    "the feedback includes every player s strategy used in the previous round and the corresponding score .",
    "particularly , every player has a unique and unaltered number in the group .",
    "the feedback for treatment 2 includes the frequency of strategy c , d and n , used in the sample group of 5 players and the corresponding payoff of every strategy . and this information is provided not only to members of the sample group but also to unchosen members remained in the population in the previous round .         in table",
    "[ tab : cooperation frequent in smaller group ] , the first column is the condition given by the number of nonparticipators .",
    "if the number equals to 5 , that means no one can choose c or d , so the range is from 0 to 4 .",
    "the second column is the total number of people choosing c and the third column is the total number of people choosing d , and the fourth column is the ratio of the number of of people choosing c over all participators in t1 .",
    "for example , given the condition that the number of nonparticipator is 0 for t1 , the number of people choosing c is 1439 , and the number of people choosing d is 1546 , the ratio @xmath12 is 0.482 . and the t2 is organized in the same way .",
    "we find no evidence to support the point of view that the cooperation is more easy to establish in smaller group . on contrary",
    ", it seems that the cooperation is more frequent in large group .",
    "actually , the group size here is changing all over the time , whereas the population size is fixed .",
    "the population size of t1 is 5 and of t2 is 13 . as mentioned above ( see table  [ tab : strategyusesummarize ] , the cooperation rate and conditional cooperation rate of t1 are higher than those of t2",
    ". it indicatess if the population is large , the cooperation is low .",
    "this results are similar to john duffy s work  @xcite .",
    "the cooperation established in a small group depends on the direct or indirect reciprocation . and",
    "this needs the glutinousness condition that the probability of another round is sufficiently high  @xcite .",
    "small is the necessary condition , but not the sufficient condition .",
    "if people can not believe the person in the group , the round will still stay in the group in next round , the reputation can hardly be established .",
    "so , the question why state changes from n to c remains for further investigate .      theoretically , the cyclic dominance of the three strategies is provided by evolutionary dynamics such as replicator dynamics .",
    "although , mathematical exploration of evolutionary models has been a hot topic of research recently ( see , e.g. , weibull , 1995 ) , but it could not catch held of the experimenters .",
    "camerer has pointed out that _ evolutionary models apply best to animals with genetically heritable strategies , or to human cultural evolution ( boyd and richerson , 1985 ) , neither of which explains rapid individual learning in the lab _",
    "( see camerer  @xcite p268 ) .",
    "huyck also emphasized : _ a lesson from the experiment is that one should discount models that predict deterministic cycles _",
    "( p148 in @xcite ) . since _",
    "the subjects do nt exhibit the kind of correlated behavior predicted by the dynamic _",
    "( p139 in @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", borgers argued that , in an appropriately constructed continuous time limit , the learning process actual movement will not differ from its expected movement  @xcite .    in this article , we provided the empirical cyclic dynamic pattern in full state space experimentally .",
    "and the result is very similar to the result given by replicator dynamics .",
    "it seems possible to establish the bridge between evolutionary theory and experimental research .",
    "if we use the new statistic measurement , for example the velocity , and get sufficient data , we can find the way to investigate the empirical dynamic pattern and can compare it with the evolutionary dynamics .      in this article",
    ", we have investigated the mechanism experimentally in the optional public goods game , and have shown , first time , the cyclic strategy pattern in full state space .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the strategies of cooperation , defection and nonparticipant form a rock - paper - scissors type cycle , and the cycle of three strategies are persistent over 200 rounds .",
    "this cycle is very similar to the cycle given by evolutionary dynamics , for example , replicator dynamics . and",
    "the rock - paper - scissors type cycle is not only existent at social level , but also at the individual level , that means the individual s strategies sequence of anticlockwise cycle of n - c - d - n exceeds it s adverse cycle",
    ". meanwhile , the distribution of social states changes in the state space and , from cooperation as the most frequent strategy to defection and from defection to nonparticipant , forms a clear rotation path in a long run .",
    "our results seem to implicate that the evolutionary dynamics has ability to capture the real dynamics not only on biosphere , but also on human society .",
    "this investigation provides the base structure to study the mechanism to sustain cooperation by evolutionary dynamics .",
