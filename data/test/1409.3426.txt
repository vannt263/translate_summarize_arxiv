    "we choose as the starting point of the present work the fundamental problem of channel simulation . roughly speaking , this problem asks when a communication channel @xmath1 from alice ( a ) to bob ( b ) can be used to simulate another channel @xmath2 , also from a to b ?",
    "@xcite this problem has many variants according to the resources available to a and b. in particular , the case when a and b can access unlimited amount of shared entanglement has been completely solved .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the asymptotic setting , to optimally simulate @xmath2 , we need to apply @xmath1 at rate @xmath4 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement - assisted classical capacity uniquely determines the properties of the channel in the simulation process .",
    "furthermore , even with stronger resources such as no - signalling correlations or feedback , this rate can not be improved ",
    "otherwise we would violate causality , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "here we are interested in the zero - error setting @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the zero - error communication problem is extremely difficult , already for classical channels .",
    "indeed , the single - shot zero - error classical communication capability of a classical noisy channel equals the independence number of the ( classical ) confusability graph induced by the channel , and the latter problem is well - known to be np - complete .",
    "the behaviour of quantum channels in zero - error communication is even more complex as striking effects such as super - activation are possible @xcite .",
    "the most general zero - error simulation problem remains wide open . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "many variants of this problem have been proposed .",
    "the most natural way is to introduce some additional resources and see how this changes the capacity . indeed ,",
    "extra resources such as classical feedback @xcite , entanglement @xcite , and even a small ( constant ) amount of forward communication @xcite , have been introduced .",
    "it has been shown these extra resources can increase the capacity , and generally simplify the problem .",
    "in particular , it was shown that even for classical communication channel , shared entanglement can strictly increase the asymptotic zero - error classical capacity @xcite . however , determining the entanglement - assisted zero - error classical capacity remains an open problem even for classical channels .",
    "more powerful resources are actually required in order to simplify the problem .",
    "@xcite introduced classical no - signalling correlations into the zero - error communication for classical channels , and showed that the well - known fractional packing number of the bipartite graph induced by the channel , gives precisely the zero - error classical capacity of the channel .",
    "previously , it was known by shannon that this fractional packing number corresponds to the zero - error classical capacity of the channel when assisted with a feedback link from the receiver to the sender and when the unassisted zero - error classical capacity is not vanishing @xcite . for",
    "general background on graph theory see @xcite , and for `` fractional graph theory '' the delightful book @xcite .",
    "another major motivation for this work is to further explore the connection between quantum information theory and the so - called `` non - commutative graph theory '' suggested in @xcite .",
    "such a connection has been well - known in classical information theory . in @xcite ,",
    "shannon realized that the zero - error capacity of a classical noisy channel only depends on the confusability graph induced by the channel .",
    "he further pointed out that in the presence of classical feedback , the zero - error capacity is completely determined by the bipartite graph of possible input - output transitions associated with the channel .",
    "thus it makes sense to talk about the zero - error capacity of a ( bipartite ) graph .",
    "the notion of non - commutative graph naturally occurs when we use quantum channels for zero - error communication . for any quantum channel ,",
    "the non - commutative graph associated with the channel captures the zero - error communication properties , thus playing a similar role to confusability graph .",
    "most notably , this notion also makes it possible to introduce a quantum lovsz @xmath0 function to upper bound the entanglement - assisted zero - error capacity that has properties quite similar to its classical analogue @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was shown that the zero - error classical capacity of a quantum channel in the presence of quantum feedback only depends on the kraus operator space of the channel @xcite .",
    "in other words , the kraus operator space plays a role that is quite similar to the bipartite graph .",
    "now it becomes clear that any classical channel induces a bipartite graph as well as a confusability graph , while a quantum channel induces a non - commutative bipartite graph and a non - commutative graph .",
    "the new insight is that we can simply regard a non - commutative ( bipartite ) graph as a high - level abstraction of all underlying quantum channels , and study its information - theoretic properties , not limited to zero - error setting .",
    "this leads us to a very general viewpoint : graphs as communication channels .",
    "for instance , we can define the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of a non - commutative bipartite graph as the minimum of the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of quantum channels that induce the given kraus operator space .",
    "it was shown that this quantity enjoys a number of interesting properties including additivity under tensor product and an operational interpretation as a sort of entanglement - assisted conclusive capacity of the bipartite graph @xcite .",
    "it remains a great challenge to find tractable forms of various capacities for non - commutative ( bipartite ) graphs .",
    "in this paper we consider a more general class of quantum no - signalling correlations described by two - input and two - output quantum channels with the no - signalling constraints .",
    "this kind of correlations naturally arises in the study of the relativistic causality of quantum operations @xcite ; see also the more recent @xcite .",
    "distinguishability of these correlations from an information theoretic viewpoint has also been studied @xcite .",
    "we provide a number of new properties of these correlations , and establish several structural theorems of these correlations .",
    "then we generalize the approach of @xcite to study the zero - error classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations , and the reverse problem of perfect simulation .",
    "we show that both problems can be completely solved in the one - shot scenario , revealing some nice structure :    1 .",
    "the answers are given by semidefinite programmes ( sdps , cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "at the same time they generalize the results of cubitt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; 3 .   for the simulation , the question is really how to form a constant channel by a convex combination of the one we want to simulate and an arbitrary other quantum channel , and the number of bits needed is just @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the probability weight of the target channel in the convex combination ( throughout this paper , @xmath7 denotes the binary logarithm ) ; 4 .   for assisted communication , there is an analogous problem of convex - combing a certain channel from b to a which has some kind of orthogonality relation with the given channel from a to b , with another one to form a constant channel .",
    "if the target channel has weight @xmath6 , then the number of bits sent is again @xmath5 .",
    "most interestingly , the solution to the communication problem only depends on the kraus operator space of the channel , not directly on the channel itself . for the simulation problem ,",
    "the solution is given by the conditional min - entropy @xcite of the channel s choi - jamiokowski matrix , and is actually additive , thus also gives the asymptotic cost of simulating the channel .",
    "if we are interested in simulating the cheapest channel contained in the kraus operator space , we obtain an sdp in terms of the projection of the choi - jamiokowski matrix . both the capacity and the simulation sdps are in general not known to be multiplicative under the tensor product of channels ,",
    "thus we do not know the optimal asymptotic simulation cost .",
    "we then focus on the asymptotic zero - error classical capacity and simulation cost assisted with quantum no - signalling correlations .",
    "this requires determining the asymptotic behaviour of a sequence of sdps . in general",
    "the one - shot solution does not give the asymptotic result , since the corresponding sdp is not multiplicative with respect to the tensor product of channels .",
    "a simple formula for the asymptotic channel capacity remains unknown .",
    "however , for the special cases of classical - quantum ( cq ) channels , we find that the zero - error capacity is given by the solution of a rather simple sdp suggested earlier by harrow as a natural generalization of the classical fractional packing number @xcite , which we call _ semidefinite packing number_. this result has two interesting corollaries .",
    "first , it implies that the zero - error classical capacity of cq - channels assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations is additive .",
    "second , and more importantly , we show that for a classical graph @xmath8 , the celebrated lovsz number @xmath9  @xcite , is actually the minimum zero - error classical capacity of any cq - channel that has the given graph as its confusability graph .",
    "in other words , lovsz @xmath0 function is the zero - error classical capacity of a graph assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first information theoretic operational interpretation of the lovsz number since its introduction in 1979 .",
    "previously , it was known that it is an upper bound on the entanglement - assisted zero - error classical capacity of a graph @xcite .",
    "it remains unknown whether the use of quantum no - signalling correlations could be replaced by shared entanglement .",
    "the asymptotic simulation cost for kraus operator spaces associated with cq - channels is rather simpler , and is actually given by the one - shot simulation cost .",
    "before we proceed to the technical details , it may be helpful to present an overview of our main results .",
    "let @xmath1 be a quantum channel from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , with a kraus operator sum representation @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the kraus operator space of @xmath1 .",
    "the choi - jamiokowski matrix of @xmath1 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are isomorphic hilbert spaces , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is orthonormal basis over @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , resp . ) , and @xmath20 is the unnormalized maximally entangled state over @xmath21 .",
    "recall that @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the projection onto the support of @xmath24 , which is the subspace @xmath25 , sometimes called the choi - jamiokowski support of @xmath26 ( or of the channel ) .",
    "it is worth noting that many results below can be defined on any matrix subspace @xmath26 , not just those corresponding to a quantum channel @xmath1 .",
    "however , we have to make sure that @xmath26 is actually corresponding to some quantum channel @xmath1 .",
    "this puts an additional constraint on @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath27 for some orthonormal basis @xmath28 such that @xmath29",
    ". then we should be able to find a quantum channel @xmath30 such that @xmath31 , for some invertible matrix @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath34 if such a positive definite matrix @xmath35 $ ] can not be found , @xmath26 will not correspond to a quantum channel ( nor any @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) . in this case",
    "one might still be able to find @xmath38 that is a kraus operator space for some quantum channel @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "( note however that @xmath26 is the limit of the kraus subspaces of genuine quantum channels , namely amplitude damping channels with damping parameter going to @xmath42 ; hence it might still be considered as admissible kraus space of an infinitesimally amplitude damping channel . )",
    "we will , therefore , always assume that @xmath26 corresponds to some quantum channel @xmath1 such that @xmath43 .",
    "from now on , any such kraus operator space @xmath26 will be alternatively called `` non - commutative bipartite graph ''  in fact , below we shall argue why it is a natural generalization of bipartite graphs .",
    "[ capacity-1-shot ] the one - shot zero - error classical capability , ( quantified as the largest number of messages ) , of @xmath1 assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations depends only on the non - commutative graph @xmath26 , and is given by the integer part of the following sdp : @xmath44 where @xmath23 denotes the projection onto the the subspace @xmath45 .",

    "_    the proof of this theorem will be given in section [ subsec:1-shot - capacity ] , where we also explore other properties of the above sdp .",
    "for another direction of investigation , looking at the specific channel @xmath1 with choi - jamiokowski matrix @xmath47 and trying to minimize the error probability for given number of messages , we refer the reader to the recent and highly relevant work of leung and matthews  @xcite , where exactly this is done in an environment with free no - signalling resources subject to other semidefinite constraints .",
    "it is evident from this theorem that the one - shot zero - error classical capacity of @xmath1 only depends on the kraus operator space @xmath26 .",
    "that is , any two quantum channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 will have the same capacity if they have the same kraus operator space . for this reason , we usually use @xmath46 to denote @xmath48 . furthermore , we can talk about the capacity of the kraus operator space @xmath26 directly without referring to the underling quantum channel .",
    "notice that a classical channel @xmath49 naturally induces a bipartite graph @xmath50 , where the input and output alphabets @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the two sets of vertices , and @xmath53 is the set of edges such that @xmath54 if and only if @xmath55 .",

    "<S> this finally results in an operational interpretation of the celebrated lovsz @xmath0 function of a graph as the zero - error classical capacity of the graph assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations , the first information theoretic interpretation of the lovsz number . </S>"
