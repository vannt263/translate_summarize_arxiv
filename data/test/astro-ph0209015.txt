    "the study of the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field of neutron stars on dense nuclear matter has gotten a new dimension after the discovery of a few magnetars .",
    "these exotic objects are believed to be strongly magnetized young neutron stars of surface magnetic field @xmath2 g @xcite .",
    "the use of scalar virial theorem shows that the magnetic field strength at the core region may go upto @xmath3 g @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very much advisable to study the effect of such strong magnetic field on various physical properties of dense neutron star matter as well as on various physical processes taking place inside neutron stars .",
    "an extensive studies have already been done on the equation of state of dense neutron star matter in presence of strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such studies are based on quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field .",
    "the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field on the gross properties , e.g. , the mass , radius , moment of inertia etc .",
    ", of neutron stars , which are strongly dependent on the equation of state of matter have also been obtained @xcite . in the second kind of studies ,",
    "how the weak processes ( reactions and decays ) are affected by the quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field have been obtained @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath1-equilibrium condition also depends on the strength of magnetic field .",
    "since the cooling of neutron stars is dominated by the emission of neutrinos produced by weak processes inside the stars , these studies also give an idea of the effect of strong magnetic field on thermal evolution of neutron stars .",
    "not only that , the presence of strong magnetic field can change significantly , both qualitatively and quantitatively the transport coefficients ( viscosity , thermal conductivity , electrical conductivity etc . ) of dense neutron star matter @xcite . the magnetic field can change the tensorial character of transport coefficients of neutron star matter in presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "such qualitative change in transport coefficients can cause some significant changes in thermal evolution of neutron star matter and the evolution of its magnetic field .",
    "there are another kind of studies ; the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field on quark - hadron phase transition @xcite .",
    "it was shown explicitly that a first order quark - hadron phase transition is absolutely forbidden if the strength of magnetic field exceeds @xmath4 g . however , a metal insulator type ( color insulator to color metal ) second order phase transition is possible unless the field strength exceeds @xmath5 g .",
    "it has also been shown , that even if there is a first order quark - hadron phase transition for magnetic field strength @xmath6 g at the core region of a neutron star , an investigation of chemical evolution of quark matter , with various initial conditions leads to the system in @xmath1-equilibrium , revealed that the system becomes energetically unstable in chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in some completely different type of studies , the stability and some of the gross properties of deformed stellar objects are analyzed with general relativity @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic field destroys the spherical symmetry of neutron star .",
    "then it is possible for a deformed and rotating neutron star to emit gravity waves , which in principle may be detected .",
    "very recently we have critically studied the ferro - magnetism of neutron star matter which could be one of the sources of residual magnetism of old neutron stars / sources of magnetic field of millisecond pulsars . in these studies",
    ", we have shown that a spontaneous ferromagnetic transition in absence of external magnetic field is not possible in neutron star matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "however in the case of neutrino trapped neutron star matter ( proto - neutron star matter ) , the possibility of such a transition can not be ruled out , provided the neutrinos carry some non - zero mass @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the problem with the occupancy of zeroth landau levels by electrons / protons , which occur in presence of ultra - strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in this critical analysis that in presence of a strong quantizing magnetic field the existence of neutron star matter in @xmath1-equilibrium is questionable . which further opens up a vital question on the possibility of magnetars as young and strongly magnetized neutron stars .    in this paper we shall present a relativistic version of pauli paramagnetism of neutron star matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "we shall extend the work of shulman @xcite to the relativistic region ( i.e. , in the high density regime of neutron star matter ) and study the paramagnetism of relativistic nuclear matter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the fully polarized configuration of electronic components puts a restriction on the upper limit of neutron star magnetic field .",
    "we have also discussed the alternative picture of neutron star structure , if the magnetic field exceeds that limit .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    ", we shall develop the formalism of relativistic version of pauli paramagnetism , in section 3 we study the pauli paramagnetism of neutron star matter and in the last section , we shall conclude and discuss the importance of this work .",
    "we consider a fermion gas of density @xmath7 in presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath8 at zero temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "then the number density is given by @xcite @xmath10^{3/2}(2x^{3/2}-1)}{6\\pi^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the magnetic dipole moment and mass of the particle and @xmath13 is a dimensionless quantity , known as the energy variable and @xmath14^{-2/3}(\\epsilon_0 ^ 2-m^2)]^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the single particle energy , @xmath15 is the value of @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 then it is a matter of simple algebraic manipulation to obtain the number densities with spin parallel and anti - parallel to the direction of magnetic field @xmath8 , and are given by @xmath19^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ n^\\downarrow(b)&=&n^\\uparrow ( b)(1-x^{-3/2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious from these two expressions that for @xmath20 , for which @xmath21 ( no field situation ) , @xmath22 , which indicates that both up and down spin states are equi - probable . on the other hand for @xmath23 we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are the saturation densities ( fully polarized scenario ) . in the case of spin saturation , the single particle energy is given by @xmath26^{1/2}\\ ] ] since for @xmath27 , the value of @xmath28 becomes negative , the lowest value of @xmath29 is @xmath30 and the corresponding saturated value for magnetic field strength is given by @xmath31\\ ] ] this is also the maximum value of magnetic field strength which the neutron star matter can sustain . in fig.(1 ) we have plotted the values of @xmath32(b ) and @xmath28(b ) ( in terms of @xmath7 ) for a fermi system against @xmath29 .",
    "the upper curve is for @xmath32(b ) and lower one corresponds to @xmath28(b ) .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that @xmath29=@xmath30 corresponds to fully polarized scenario , whereas @xmath33 corresponds to completely unpolarized picture .",
    "we next consider a @xmath0 system inside a neutron star in presence of a strong magnetic field at @xmath34 = @xmath35 ( since the chemical potential @xmath36 for the @xmath37th species is @xmath38 the temperature of the system @xmath34 ) .",
    "now in presence of a strong magnetic field , the chemical potential for the @xmath37th component is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , or @xmath41 .",
    "the charge neutrality condition gives @xmath42 = @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number density of @xmath37th species .",
    "finally , the baryon number density is given by @xmath45 which we treat as a constant parameter .",
    "it has been noticed from some critical investigations that the @xmath1-equilibrium condition can not be achieved in a polarized neutron star matter ( @xmath0 system in presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed some arbitrary iso - spin symmetry , defined by the parameter @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( since the matter with excess protons is highly unstable , we have not considered negative values of @xmath1 ) . then combining eqns.(9 ) and ( 10 ) we have @xmath48 hence after a little algebraic manipulation , we have from eq,(2 ) , the dimensionless energy variable for the species @xmath37 @xmath49^{3/2}\\ ] ] it clearly shows that the dimensionless energy variables for the constituents are functions of magnetic field strength b , density of matter @xmath50 and the iso - spin symmetry parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we have taken @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively the nuclear magneton and bohr magneton . in figs.(2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we have shown that the variations of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath8 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 ( to avoid some numerical problem we have taken @xmath62 instead of @xmath61 ) .",
    "all these figures show that within the range of magnetic field strength relevance for magnetized neutron stars , neutrons and protons never become fully polarized ( @xmath63 ) whereas the value of @xmath64 is very close to unity which means that the electrons are in very close to fully polarized configuration . in figs.(5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we have plotted the same quantities for @xmath65 . in these sets of figure also very close to fully polarized states for electrons",
    "is possible whereas neutrons and protons remain in the states with almost unpolarized configuration .",
    "however both the neutron matter and the proton matter can be made fully polarized by increasing the strength of magnetic field .",
    "we have noticed that although the electronic component becomes fully polarized for @xmath66 g , the nuclear matter can only become fully polarized if and only if the magnetic field strength exceeds @xmath5 g . we have also observed that for such strong magnetic fields make @xmath67 negative , which is completely unphysical .",
    "therefore , the fully polarized configuration of electronic component restricts the upper limit of a neutron star magnetic field to @xmath68 g .",
    "however the inclusion of pions @xmath69 or kaons @xmath70 instead of electrons does not impose any restriction on the upper limit . at the same time the inclusion of these two components instead on electrons",
    "allow the @xmath71 system to become fully polarized even in @xmath1-equilibrium condition .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the magnetars , if they exist at all and are assumed to be strongly magnetized young neutron stars , the constituents are possibly @xmath72 or @xmath73 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise the existence of such objects is impossible .",
    "the incorporation of interaction in nuclear matter sector does not change the conclusion .",
    "the observed maximum polarization in the electronic sector whereas almost unpolarized configuration of nuclear matter regime is because of several orders of magnitude difference in the magnitudes of magnetic dipole moments . in the case of electron",
    "it is @xmath74 bohr magneton , whereas in the case of nucleons it is @xmath74 nuclear magneton .",
    "this is independent of the type of interaction in the neutron star matter .",
