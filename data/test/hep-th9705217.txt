    "the gauging of a non - linear sigma model , giving rise to a coupling between scalar ( coordinates of the target space ) and gauge fields has attracted interest from different areas . in particular ,",
    "soliton solutions of the gauged o(3 ) chern - simons model may be relevant in planar condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "recently , self - dual solutions were obtained in a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions gauged o(3 ) sigma model @xcite . in the context of skyrme models the requirement of gauge symmetry was used to break the scale invariance of the o(3 ) sigma model with gauge field dynamics governed by a maxwell term , where the gauge group u(1 ) is a subgroup of o(3 ) , giving the so called baby skyrme model @xcite ( aided by a potential term ) .",
    "other works , in which the gauge field dynamics is governed by a chern - simons term , were studied in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "these systems becomes self - dual for a specific choice of the higgs potential and topological as well as nontopological solutions are present @xcite .",
    "stern @xcite was the first one to suggest a nonminimal term in the context of the maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics intending to mimic an anyonic behavior without a pure chern - simons limit .",
    "this term could be interpreted as a generalization of the pauli coupling , _",
    "i. e. _ , an anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "it is a specific feature of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions that the pauli coupling exists not only for spinning particles but for scalar ones too @xcite . as a fundamental result",
    ", stern showed that , for a particular value of the nonminimal coupling constant , the field equations of his model have the same form of the field equations of a _ pure _ chern - simons theory minimally coupled .    in this work we consider an _",
    "abelian _ gauged",
    "o(3 ) sigma model with a nonminimal coupling , where we have included maxwell and chern - simons terms .",
    "self - dual soliton solutions are obtained for this model at a critical value for the nonminimal coupling constant .",
    "our soliton solutions are charged , but the magnetic flux is topologically quantized only for topological solitons ( where stability is guaranteed by topological arguments ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the bogomolnyi bound @xcite will be achieved with the introduction of a neutral scalar field .",
    "previously , a _",
    "non - abelian _ gauged sigma model with anomalous magnetic moment was discussed @xcite .",
    "however that work did not considered the higgs potential .",
    "finally , we give the asymptotic behaviour of the topological and the nontopological solitons and present the numerically calculated soliton profiles for _ both _ cases .",
    "in the o(3 ) sigma model the scalar field @xmath0 is a map from the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space to the two - sphere of unit radius denoted by @xmath1 . in other words",
    ", @xmath0 is a three component vector satisfying the constraint @xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "now we look for a lagrangian invariant under global iso - rotations of the field @xmath0 about a fixed axis @xmath4 @xmath5 . in order to gauge this symmetry ,",
    "we choose @xmath6 and select the local u(1 ) subgroup of the o(3 ) rotational group .    therefore , the nonminimal gauged o(3 ) sigma model is defined by the following lagrangian density @xmath7 where the second term is the called chern - simons term and the minimal gauge covariant derivative @xmath8 { \\bf { n}}\\times \\pmb { \\phi } $ ] was changed by @xmath9 { \\bf { n}}\\times \\pmb { % \\phi \\quad \\quad . }",
    "\\label{two}\\ ] ] the real scalar field @xmath10 is introduced for convenience , as explained later .",
    "this lagrangian is clearly gauge invariant since the potential depends only on @xmath11 which is gauge invariant .",

    "\\label{five}\\ ] ] the solutions of the first order differential equation @xmath20 are also solutions of ( [ five ] ) provided that @xmath21 holds .",
    "this result is completely analogous to that presented by stern @xcite and later by torres @xcite in the context of maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics .",
    "it is worth mentioning _  _ that the @xmath22 component of the equation ( [ six ] ) is the corresponding _ gauss law , _",
    "namely @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the magnetic and electric fields respectively",
    ".    integration of ( [ gauss ] ) in the whole space leads to @xmath26 therefore , charged vortices with charge @xmath27 are also tubes of magnetic flux .",
    "now we construct the energy functional . in this direction ,",
    "a matter field equation of motion is required and it is possible to express it in terms of currents .",
    "so , let us consider the following equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath28 we define a new matter current ( which is a vector in the target space ) as @xmath29 thus the equation ( [ four ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath30 now the equation of motion ( [ eight ] ) turns to @xmath31 where we have used ( [ nine ] ) and ( [ ten ] ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness it is interesting to express the current @xmath32 in terms of a current without explicit magnetic moment contribution , denoted by @xmath33 @xmath34 .",

    ", whereas figs .",
    "4 - 5 show the functions @xmath72 and @xmath86 for the nontopological case .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath24 as a function of @xmath68 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 is also presented in figs . 3 and 6 respectively .",
    "here it is interesting to comment that for nontopological solitons ( fig .",
    "6 ) , the magnetic field has doubly degenerate maxima , as first pointed out by ghosh and ghosh @xcite .",
    "there degenerate and nondegenerate maxima depend on the value of @xmath112 , while here this behaviour depends on the values of @xmath113 wherefore on the values of the relation @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper we have considered a gauged o(3 ) sigma model with both maxwell and chern - simons terms . besides the minimal coupling , an extra term which couples the complex scalar field directly to the gauge field strength , was introduced . as in the context of maxwell - chern - simons - higgs systems the presence of self - dual solutions is guaranteed only by introduction of a neutral scalar field .",
    "bogomolnyi equations were constructed for a _ specific form _ of the potential and generic nonminimal coupling constant . however , in contrast with several nonminimal models existing in the literature , at a critical value for the nonminimal coupling parameter , we have obtained topological as well as nontopological soliton solutions ( see however @xcite , where a dimensional reduction is used to construct a @xmath115 maxwell - chern - simons - higgs nonminimal model ) .",
    "numerical solutions for _ both _ topological and nontopological cases are obtained and presented .",
    "it is known that the critical condition @xmath116 turns a maxwell - chern - simons system in a pure chern - simons one @xcite .",
    "so it is not surprising that for o(3 ) sigma models our results are similar to the numerical solutions of ghosh and ghosh @xcite for an o(3 ) sigma model where the gauge field dynamics is solely governed by a chern - simons term . indeed ,",
    "for instance , the unusual behaviour of the magnetic field for nontopological solitons with doubly degenerate maxima are present in our model for specific values of @xmath109 . to choose a value for @xmath117 means to choose a value for the coefficient @xmath118 of the cs term ,",
    "so @xmath118 can be used to define a class of solutions with degenerate or non degenerate maxima of the magnetic field .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , notwithstanding the resemblance commented above , the maxwell - chern - simons theories even in the large distance limit are richer than the pure chern - simons model @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the moduli space dynamics of the solutions can be quite different due to the contribution of the maxwell term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "recalling the baby skyrme model , the above discussed aspects of our model may be used in an analysis of a relation between maxwell , hopf and skyrme terms in order to break the scale invariance of the sigma model .",
