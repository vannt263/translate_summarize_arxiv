    "the theory of particle acceleration at shock fronts moving with arbitrary speeds ( from newtonian to ultra - relativistic ) can be formulated in a simple and exact form @xcite , at least in the so - called _ test particle _",
    "limit , which neglects the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles on the shock . in this framework ,",
    "all the basic physical ingredients can be taken into account in an exact way , with special reference to the type of scattering that is responsible for the particles to return to the shock front from the upstream and downstream plasmas .",
    "the information about scattering is introduced in the problem through a function @xmath0 which expresses the probability per unit length that a particle moving in the direction @xmath1 is scattered to a new direction @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath3 can have a different functional form in the upstream and downstream plasmas , in particular in the case of relativistic shocks .",
    "the repeated scatterings of the particles lead eventually to return to the shock front , as described in terms of the conditional probability @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) that a particle entering the upstream ( downstream ) plasma in the direction @xmath6 , returns to the shock and crosses it in the direction of the downstream ( upstream ) plasma in the direction @xmath2 .",
    "the mathematical method adopted to calculate the two very important functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 based upon the knowledge of the elementary scattering function @xmath3 was described in detail in @xcite , and is based on solving two non - linear integral - differential equations in the two independent coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite showed on very general grounds that the spectrum of accelerated particles is a power law for all momenta exceeding the injection momentum .",
    "the slope of such power law and the anisotropy pattern of the accelerated particles near the shock front are fully determined by the conditional probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath7 and by the equation of state of the downstream plasma .",
    "particle acceleration at shock fronts has been previously investigated through different methods , both semi - analytical ( see for example @xcite ) and numerical , by using monte carlo simulations ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . the theory of particle acceleration developed by @xcite and @xcite has been checked versus several of these calculations existing in the literature , both in the case of non relativistic shocks and for relativistic shocks , and assuming small as well as large pitch angle isotropic scattering ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion of these results ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend the application of this new theoretical framework to two new interesting situations : 1 ) presence of a coherent large scale magnetic field in the upstream fluid ; 2 ) anisotropic scattering . in both cases",
    "we calculate the spectrum of accelerated particles and the distribution in pitch angle ( upstream and downstream ) for shock fronts moving with arbitrary velocity .",
    "the results of point 1 ) are compared with those obtained in @xcite , carried out for a parallel ultra - relativistic shock .",
    "the paper has been inspired by the need to address several points of phenomenological relevance .",
    "as far as relativistic shocks are concerned , it was understood that the return of the particles to the shock surface from the upstream region can be warranted even in the absence of scattering , provided the background magnetic field is at an angle with the shock normal ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shock and the accelerated particles remain spatially close and regular deflection takes place before particles can experience the complex , possibly turbulent structure of the upstream magnetic field .",
    "this implies that the calculation of the spectrum of the accelerated particles can not be calculated using a formalism based on the assumption of pitch angle diffusion , as in the vast majority of the existing literature .    in the downstream region ,",
    "the motion of the shock is always quasi - newtonian , even when the shock moves at ultra - relativistic speeds .",
    "this implies that the propagation of the particles is generally well described by ( small or large ) pitch angle scattering .",
    "however , the turbulent structure of the magnetic field , responsible for the scattering , is likely to have an anisotropic structure and be therefore responsible for anisotropic scattering .",
    "in fact , even in the case of isotropic turbulence , the scattering can determine an anisotropic pattern of particle scattering .",
    "it follows that a determination of the spectrum able to take into account these potentially important situations is very important .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in  [ sec : exact ] we briefly summarize the theoretical framework introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in  [ sec : regular ] we consider in detail the case of a large scale magnetic field in the upstream frame and no scattering of the particles .",
    "the scattering is assumed to be isotropic in the downstream plasma . in  [ sec : ani ] we introduce the possibility of anisotropic scattering in both upstream and downstream plasmas .",
    "we summarize in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we summarize the main characteristics of the theory of particle acceleration developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to this previous work for further details .",
    "the power of this novel approach is in its generality : it provides an exact solution for the spectrum of the accelerated particles and at the same time the distribution in pitch angle that the particles acquire due to scattering in the upstream and downstream fluids .",
    "this mathematical approach is applicable without restrictions on the velocity of the fluid speeds ( from newtonian to ultra - relativistic ) and irrespective of the scattering properties of the background plasmas ( small as well as large angle scattering , isotropic or anisotropic scattering ) .",
    "the only condition which is necessary for the theory to work is common to most if not all other semi - analytical approaches existing in the literature , namely that the acceleration must take place in the test particles regime : no dynamical reaction is currently introduced in the calculations . as a consequence , the shock is assumed to conserve its strength during the acceleration time , and the acceleration is assumed to have reached a stationary regime .",
    "the directions of motion of the particles in the downstream and upstream frames are identified through the cosine of their pitch angles , all evaluated in the comoving frames of the fluids that they refer to .",
    "the direction of motion of the shock , identified as the @xmath9 axis , is assumed to be oriented from upstream to downstream , following the direction of motion of the fluid in the shock frame ( @xmath10 corresponds to particles moving toward the downstream section ) .",
    "the transport equation for the particle distribution function @xmath11 , as obtained in @xcite in a relativistically covariant derivation reads    @xmath12          d\\mu ' d\\phi '         + \\omega { \\partial g \\over \\partial \\tilde\\phi } , \\ ] ]    in which both scattering and regular deflection in a large scale magnetic field are taken into account .    here",
    "all quantities are written in the fluid frame , with the exception of the spatial coordinate @xmath9 , the distance from the shock along the shock normal , which is measured in the shock frame . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the velocity and the lorentz factor of the fluid with respect to the shock . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the polar coordinates of particles in momentum space , measured with respect to the shock normal , while @xmath17 is the longitudinal angle around the magnetic field direction . as usual @xmath18 and @xmath19",

    "@xmath20 is the scattering probability per unit length , namely the probability that a particle moving in the direction ( @xmath21 ) is scattered to a direction ( @xmath22 ) after travelling a unit length .",
    "an important simplification of eq . ( [ sez2eq_transport_eq ] ) occurs when an axial symmetry is assumed . in this case",
    "the scattering probability depends only on @xmath23 and the large scale magnetic field can be either zero or different from zero but parallel to the shock normal . in both cases",
    "it is straightforward to integrate eq .",
    "( [ sez2eq_transport_eq ] ) over @xmath16 : the two - dimensional integral on the right - hand side simplifies to an integral in one dimension , while the term @xmath24 disappears .",

    "were defined through a set of two integral - differential non linear equations by @xcite .",
    "we report these equations here for completeness :    @xmath29    @xmath30    in the equations above we used : @xmath31 which is unity by definition .",
    "it is worth stressing that eq .",
    "( [ sez2eq_pu ] ) provides automatically the correct normalization for the return probability from upstream : @xmath32 , independent of the entrance angle @xmath33 . in ",
    "[ sec : regular ] we will generalize the method to include the possibility of deflection by large scale magnetic fields , which is one of the achievements of this work . in that case we will show that the return probability from upstream is no longer bound to be unity , due to the escape of particles from the upstream region .    the procedure for the calculation of the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles , as found by @xcite and @xcite , is as follows : for a given lorentz factor of the shock ( @xmath34 ) , the velocity of the upstream fluid @xmath35 is calculated .",
    "the velocity @xmath36 of the downstream fluid is found from the usual jump conditions at the shock and through the adoption of an equation of state for the downstream fluid .",

    "finding this value provides not only the slope of the spectrum but also the angular distribution function @xmath40 .",
    "no assumption has been introduced so far about the scattering processes that determine the motion of the particles in the upstream and downstream plasmas , with the exception of the axial symmetry of the function @xmath20 .",
    "a special case of this symmetric situation is that of isotropic scattering , that takes place when the scattering probability @xmath43 only depends upon the deflection angle @xmath44 , related to the initial and final directions through @xmath45    among the many functional forms that correspond physically to isotropic scattering , the simplest one is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the mean scattering angle .",

    "@xmath3 becomes flat and corresponds to the case of isotropic large angle scattering ( las ) . in ",
    "[ sec : model_ani ] we will modify this functional form to introduce the possibility of anisotropic scattering .",
    "it is well known that particle acceleration at a shock front with parallel magnetic field without scattering centers does not work .",
    "this magnetic scattering may be self - generated by the same particles , but the process of generation depends on the conditions in specific astrophysical environments .",
    "the case in which a regular magnetic field not parallel to the shock normal is present in the upstream fluid is quite interesting in that it allows for the return of the particles to the shock front even in the absence of scattering . in this section",
    "we investigate in detail the process of acceleration at shocks with arbitrary velocity when only a regular large scale magnetic field is present upstream ( no scattering ) .",
    "we assume that enough turbulence is instead present in the downstream plasma to guarantee magnetic scattering of the particles .",
    "there are two main differences introduced by this situation when compared with the standard case considered in the previous section :    * _ ( a ) _ particle motion in the upstream region is deterministic : the stochasticity introduced by the interaction with scattering centers is assumed to be absent .",
    "this requires a new determination of the return probability @xmath7 introduced above . *",
    "_ ( b ) _ the presence of regular magnetic field with arbitrary orientation breaks the axial symmetry around the shock normal .",
    "this , in principle , would force us to treat the problem in the four angular variables @xmath53 and @xmath16 .    in the following",
    "we will show how addressing point _ ( a )",
    "_ in fact solves point _",
    "( b ) _ as well .",
    "let us consider a particle entering upstream in the direction identified by the two angles @xmath33 and @xmath54 , and returning to the shock along the direction identified by @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "since the motion of the particle is deterministic , the return direction is completely defined by the incoming coordinates , and we can write in full generality : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained from the solution of the equation of motion , as discussed below .",
    "one can see that @xmath7 is effectively a function of only two variables .    in order to apply the same mathematical procedure introduced in  [ sec : exact ] , we need to write @xmath7 as a function of azimuthal angles only .",
    "therefore we use the properties of the delta function in @xmath58 , to write : @xmath59    we now show that @xmath27 , as defined by eq . ( [ sez3eq_pu_b_2 ] ) , is exactly the function to be used in eq .",
    "( [ sez2eq_q^t ] ) .",
    "this is easily shown by writing the fluxes of particles ingoing and outgoing the upstream plasma :    @xmath60    which , when integrated over @xmath16 , yields @xmath61 where we assumed that @xmath62 is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "this is exactly the same relationship as was used in @xcite , and proves our point that the system may , in the average , still be treated as if it were symmetric about the shock normal .",
    "the key assumption here is that the flux crossing back into the upstream region from the downstream one , @xmath62 , be independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath16 .",
    "this is of course true in the newtonian regime , because there the residence time for all particles diverges , and there is time for deflections to effectively erase anisotropies in the @xmath16 direction . but",
    "this must be true _ a fortiori _ in the relativistic regime , when one considers that the properties of scattering are of course still the same as in the newtonian regime , while the surface to be recrossed , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shock , is running away from the particles at a speed that becomes , asymptotically , a fair fraction of the particles speed .",
    "so , while not exactly true , the independence of @xmath62 from @xmath16 is at least a good approximation .    in order to write @xmath27 in a more explicit way",
    ", we need to solve the equation of motion of the particles , namely find the direction at which the particles re - cross the shock front as a function of the incoming direction .",

    "this implies : @xmath84 * the particle velocity along the shock normal has to be less than the shock speed , namely @xmath85    particles not satisfying this last condition escape the shock region towards upstream infinity , a situation which is not realized in the case of scattering considered in  [ sec : exact ] .",
    "this escape process occurs only for @xmath86 , and results in the loss of particles having the entrance pitch angles cosine exceeding @xmath87 .",
    "in fact for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and all particles eventually re - cross the shock .    when the particles are allowed to escape upstream , the acceleration is clearly expected to become less efficient and give rise to softer spectra of the accelerated particles ( see  [ sec : sp_ani ] ) .",
    "putting together all of the above , we can finally write the upstream conditional probability as @xmath90 where the sum is extended over the two branches of the jacobian .    for @xmath88 the particles always return to the shock front and this forces the return probability to be unity when integrated over all outgoing directions : @xmath91 this integral condition is trivially satisfied by eq .",

    "the only information still lacking to proceed further is an equation of state for the medium , that would allow us to compute the velocity of the downstream fluid from the jump conditions at the shock front ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the gas upstream has zero pressure .",
    "moreover , in the following we assume everywhere that the magnetic field has no dynamical role , so that the standard jump conditions for an unmagnetized shock can be adopted ( the role of the magnetic field becomes important when the magnetic energy density becomes comparable with the thermal energy density @xcite ) .",
    "following much of the previous literature , we adopt the synge equation of state for the downstream gas @xcite , assuming that only protons contribute .",
    "although used widely , this assumption may not be well justified in a general case .",
    "we will illustrate our conclusions on the role of the equation of state for the spectrum and anisotropy of the accelerated particles in a separate paper .    within this set of assumptions",
    "it is worth reminding that the compression ratio @xmath100 tends asymptotically to @xmath101 for a non relativistic shock ( even for shock speeds that are known to give lower compression factors ) and to @xmath102 for ultra - relativistic shocks .",

    "it may appear rather surprising that in the limit of relativistic shocks the spectrum of accelerated particles is softer in the las regime than it is in the spas regime , since las is envisioned as more efficient in redirecting the particles to the shock front .",
    "this intuitive vision turns out to be incorrect , as also shown in table 1 , where we list the slope , the average energy gain and the return probability from downstream ( as defined in eqs .",

    "qualitatively this can be understood as follows : when the shock velocity increases , particles are caught up by the shock front when they have travelled only a small fraction ( of order @xmath114 ) of their gyration .",
    "once downstream , las is likely to swing them far from the shock front in a few interactions , while spas deflects their trajectories rather slowly yet remaining in the vicinity of the shock surface .",

    "we have already emphasized that for any orientation different from that of a perpendicular shock , and in the absence of scattering processes upstream , particles are lost from the upstream region , because the shock can not catch up with their motion .",

    "[ sez3fig_slope_cos(alpha ) ] we also plot the return probability from upstream : for very inclined shocks the return probability is still very close to unity , as in the case of upstream scattering , but it drops rapidly for increasingly less inclined shocks .    the steepening of the spectrum due to leakage of the particles towards upstream infinity can also be understood in terms of a bell - like @xcite calculation , when carried out for the case of a large scale coherent magnetic field .",
    "the slope of the spectrum is related to the average return probability and to the average energy gain of the particles per cycle back and forth through the shock front through the expression :    @xmath124    where @xmath110 is the mean amplification in a single cycle ( downstream @xmath125 upstream @xmath125 downstream ) , and @xmath126 is the mean probability of returning to the shock .",
    "one should keep in mind that bell s method , as expressed through the equation above is flawed in that it does not take into proper consideration the correlation between the amplification factor and the return probability .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ sez3eq_bell_slope ] ) hides the assumption of isotropy of the distribution function of the accelerated particles , since that formula was conceived in a discussion of non relativistic shocks ( @xcite introduced this formalism for particle acceleration at relativistic shock fronts ) .",

    "was found in @xcite , and reads : @xmath127 in the following we use eq .",
    "( [ sez3eq_bell_slope ] ) , since we only want to provide the reader with an argument of plausibility for the steepening of the spectra in those cases in which particle leakage can take place in the upstream region .",

    "energy amplification for a particle entering the upstream region with direction @xmath33 ( as measured downstream ) and returning with direction @xmath2 , is obtained combining two lorentz transformations : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the returning direction as seen in the upstream frame .",

    "the agreement with our exact results is better than @xmath136 , proving that the reason for the softening of the spectra of accelerated particles is in the increased probability that the particles leave the acceleration region when only a large scale coherent magnetic field is present upstream .     for three different values of the shock speed .",
    "the dashed lines show the spectral slope computed with bell s method .",
    "small box : the corresponding upstream return probabilities .",
    "[ sez3fig_slope_cos(alpha ) ] ]    the results discussed above apply to situations in which the magnetic field in the upstream region can be considered as coherent on spatial scales exceeding the size of the acceleration box .",
    "if the coherence scale of the field is smaller than the size of the accelerator , then the direction of the particles suffer a random wandering motion and one can think of this structured field as the source of diffusion and as a physical mechanism that imposes a maximum energy to the accelerated particles ( at least in the absence of radiative energy losses ) .",
    "particles that escape from the shock region too fast ( highest energy ones ) have enough time to _ feel _ the effect of a coherent scale , while lower energy particles live in the accelerator for longer times and in principle may _ feel _ different orientations of the upstream magnetic field .",
    "this scenario is basically equivalent to having some degree of scattering upstream , and should be treated with the formalism already discussed in @xcite .",
    "as soon as a phenomenon equivalent to scattering is present , the probability of escape to upstream infinity vanishes , for all those particles that are confined in the accelerator for sufficiently long times .",
    "moreover , one should keep in mind that even if a large scale coherent magnetic field is present to start with , the propagation of the accelerated ( charged ) particles in the upstream plasma is very likely to excite fluctuations in the magnetic field structure through streaming instability @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations act as scattering centers and enhance the probability of returning to the shock front .",
    "in this section we consider again the standard case in which particle motion in both the upstream and downstream fluids is diffusive , due to the presence of scattering agents .",
    "however , we include the possibility that the scattering , though spatially constant , may be anisotropic .",
    "the physical motivation for this generalization is the following : in a background of alfvn waves with a power spectrum @xmath137 ( such that @xmath138 is the energy density in the form of waves with wavenumber in the range @xmath139 around @xmath140 ) the particles suffer angular diffusion with a diffusion coefficient @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the resonant wavenumber and @xmath143 is the gyration frequency of particles with momentum @xmath144 in the background magnetic field @xmath145 .",
    "one can clearly see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) that the diffusion is anisotropic in general , unless the power spectrum has a specific _ ad hoc _ form .",
    "one should keep in mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) is obtained in the context of quasi - linear theory .",
    "a full non - linear treatment might show how the turbulence is distributed and which is the resulting particle angular distribution .    in the calculations that follow ,",
    "we quantify the effects of anisotropic scattering on the spectrum and angular distribution of the accelerated particles .",
    "the calculation of specific patterns of anisotropy in the scattering agents is beyond the scopes of this paper , therefore we adopt a few simple but physically meaningful toy models of anisotropic scattering and we carry out the calculations within those models .",
    "we parametrize the anisotropy in such a way to reproduce the following four patterns :    * _ case a _ : particles are scattered per unit length more efficiently while they move away from the shock front than they are on their way to the shock front , both upstream and downstream . *",
    "_ case b _ ( opposite of case _ a _ ) : particles are scattered per unit length more efficiently on their way to the shock front than they are while they move away from the shock front , both upstream and downstream . * _ case c _ : in the downstream fluid , particles are scattered per unit length more efficiently while they move away from the shock front ( @xmath146 ) than they are on their way to the shock front ( @xmath147 ) . in the upstream fluid the situation is reversed , and scattering is more efficient for the particles that are moving toward of the shock ( @xmath146 ) . * _ case d _ ( opposite of _ c _ ) : scattering is more effective around @xmath148 both upstream and downstream .    a pictorial representation of cases _ a - d _ is shown in fig .

    "in particular , to achieve this goal we allow the width @xmath47 of the scattering function to depend on both the initial and final directions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so that :    @xmath149    it is worth stressing that the scattering function has to be symmetric if we exchange @xmath2 with @xmath1 as a consequence of liouville s theorem , so we are forced to look for a symmetric function @xmath150 .    in order to apply the functional form eq .",

    "is generally accompanied by a hardening of the spectra of accelerated particles .",
    "the peak seen in fig .",
    "[ sez3fig_slope_anis_a10 ] is simply the consequence of an effective value of @xmath47 in the anisotropic scattering cases _ a _ and _ d_. this is also clear comparing angular distributions of fig .",

    "in this paper we carried out exact calculations of the angular distribution function and spectral slope of the particles accelerated at plane shock fronts moving with arbitrary velocity , generalizing a method previously described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we specialized our calculations to two situations : 1 ) presence of a large scale coherent magnetic field of arbitrary orientation with respect to the shock normal , in the upstream fluid ; 2 ) possibility of anisotropic scattering in the upstream and downstream plasmas .    our calculations allowed us to describe the importance of the inclination of the magnetic field when this has a large coherence length and there are no scattering agents upstream .",
    "for newtonian shocks , only quasi - perpendicular fields ( namely perpendicular to the shock normal ) are of practical importance , in that the return of particles to the shock from the upstream section is warranted .",
    "quasi - parallel shocks imply a very low probability of return , so that the spectrum of accelerated particles is extremely soft .",
    "the process of acceleration eventually shuts off for parallel shocks . for relativistic shocks , the situation is less pessimistic because the accelerated particles and the shock front move with comparable velocities in the upstream frame . in general , the acceleration stops being efficient when the cosine of the inclination angle @xmath70 of the magnetic field with respect to the shock normal is comparable with the shock speed in units of the speed of light .",

    "[ sez3fig_slope_cos(alpha ) ] . in the same figure",
    "we also show the return probability from the upstream section , in order to emphasize that the presence of a large scale magnetic field upstream leads to particle leakage to upstream infinity .",
    "this latter phenomenon disappears when scattering is present , in that scattering always allows for the shock to reach the accelerated particles . in this case",
    "the probability of returning to the shock at an arbitrary direction is unity .",
    "one can ask when and how the transition from a situation in which there is no scattering to one in which scattering is at work takes place . when some scattering is present but the energy density in the scattering agents ( e.g. alfvn waves ) is very low compared with the energy density in the background magnetic field , only very low energy particles are effectively scattered .",
    "when their energy becomes large enough , they only feel the presence of the coherent field . increasing the amount of scattering ,",
    "this transition energy becomes gradually higher .",
    "particles whose larmor radius is larger that the coherence scale of the magnetic field can eventually escape the accelerator . in general the level of turbulence ( and therefore of scattering ) and the number of accelerated particles are not independent since the turbulence may be self - generated through streaming - like instabilities @xcite .    in  [ sec : ani ] we extended our analysis to the very interesting case of anisotropic scattering in both the upstream ( unshocked ) and downstream ( shocked ) medium . the pattern of anisotropy , which clearly depends on the details of the formation and development of the scattering centers , has been parametrized in four different scenarios , and for each one we calculated the angular part of the distribution function and the spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "deviations from the predictions obtained in the context of isotropic spas and las have been quantified : the typical magnitude of these deflections is a few percent , but there are situations in which the deviation is more interesting , in particular because it goes in the direction of making spectra harder ."
