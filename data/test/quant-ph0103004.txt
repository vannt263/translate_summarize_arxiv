    "quantum game and quantum strategies is a new born field .",
    "although many novel features have been discovered by researchers in the previous works1,2,3,4,5 , some problems also exist . in a recent article of luca marinatto and tullio weber@xcite",
    ", they proposed a scheme to quantize the famous _ battle of the sexes game_. in the usual exposition of this game , alice and bob are trying to decide where to go on saturday night .",
    "alice wants to attend the opera , while bob prefers to watch tv . and both players would be happier to spend the evening together rather than apart . both players want to maximize their individual payoff . table ( [ table 1 ] ) indicates the payoffs of alice and bob .",
    "the first entry in the parenthesis refers to alice s payoff , and the second to bob s . to satisfy the preferences of the two players , the condition @xmath0 is imposed.@xmath1there are two nash equilibrium @xmath2 and @xmath3 existing in the classical form of the game .",
    "since there is no transfer of information between two players , they face the dilemma in choosing between two stable solutions .",
    "if the mismatch situation occurs , that is if one player chooses strategy @xmath4 and the other chooses strategy @xmath5 , then the payoff to both players is @xmath6 and it is the worst situation .",
    "luca marinatto and tullio weber@xcite give an hilbert structure to the strategic spaces of the players , so allowing the existence of linear combinations of classical strategies to be interpreted according to usual formalism of orthodox quantum mechanics .",
    "they applied this formalism to the study of the _",
    "_  battle of the sexes game__. the result is that if both players are allowed to play entangled quantum strategies , the game has a unique solution .",
    "this article attracts the attention of s.c .",
    "benjamin and he made a comment@xcite on it .",
    "in his comment two observations were made : `` firstly , the overall quantization scheme is fundamentally very similar to the scheme proposed by eisert et al.@xcite - the similarity is non - obvious because of the very different use of the word ` strategy ' in the two approaches .",
    "secondly , we argue that the quantum _ battle of the sexes game _ does not in fact have a unique solution , hence the players are still subject to a dilemma . '' in the work of luca marinatto and tullio weber@xcite , the initial strategy is set to @xmath7 , and ` tactics ' of the players are limited to a probabilistic choice between applying the identity @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "so benjamin pointed out `` this is a severe restriction on the full range of quantum mechanically possible manipulation '' . in the scheme of luca marinatto and tullio weber@xcite , @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are used to represent the probability of alice s and bob s choosing @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the authors get two profile tactics which satisfy the maximum expected payoff of the players .",
    "one is @xmath13 and the other is @xmath14 . since the final entangled quantum ` strategy ' remains unchanged in either case , so this is the unique solution in the game .",
    "however , benjamin wrote that `` it seems to us that a clear dilemma remains for the players '' .",
    "because there are two pairs of tactics @xmath13 and @xmath14 , without knowing the choice of the other player , the players face the dilemma to choose between them , benjamin continue , `` if the tactics are mismatched , i.e. if either @xmath15 or @xmath16 are adopted , then the worst situation will occur .",
    "this is almost the same problem faced by the players in the traditional game . ''",
    "in replying these remarks , luca marinatto & tullio weber outlined some topical points of their work which they hold to be crucial for a better comprehension of their new approach to the quantum theory of games@xcite .",
    "regarding terminology , they think `` the choice of calling ` strategies ' the quantum states instead of the ` operators ' used to manipulate them , is very natural and quite consistent with the spirit of the classical game theory '' .",
    "as far as the choice of the tactics set is concerned ,  they wrote that `` obviously the class of allowed manipulations could be enlarged , but in our paper we did not take care of this possibility since our minimal choice was enough to reproduce intact the classical results when considering only factorizable strategies and to obtain the disappearance of the dilemma when resorting to entangled strategies '' .",
    "as regards the possibility of the occurrence of the mismatch situation , they consider it from the perspective of practical operation .",
    "they think that `` since both the choices will eventually lead to the same final strategy '' , `` it is therefore apparent that both players , knowing this fact , will decide doing nothing on their strategy '' .",
    "they have two reasons for their decision .",
    "one is that `` doing nothing could be considered cheaper than doing something '' .",
    "the other is `` which player will in fact decide to refuse a certain gain , without prospects of a better gain and running the risk of incurring a loss ? '' .    the reply of luca marinatto and tullio weber sounds reasonable  from the perspective of their paper .",
    "yet we consider the terminology  _ strategy _ as the operation of a player on his state .",
    "the process of obtaining initial state is not included in the strategic space . according to the concept of the static game ,",
    "the strategic moves of the players are local operations , and each player has no information about the strategies of other player .",
    "since the process of obtaining initial state @xmath17 from @xmath18 must be a global operation and every player clearly knows it , so this process could not be called as _",
    "strategy_. furthermore we think that in the scheme of luca marinatto & tullio weber the probability @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are used to represent the probability of alice s and bob s choosing @xmath12 respectively , are classical probabilities . since @xmath12 and @xmath8 are equivalent to classical pure strategies `` flip '' and `` not - flip '' respectively , the operation of the player could be considered as the classical mixture of classical strategies .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new scheme in which there is no restriction on the quantum mechanically possible manipulations of the players , and the strategy space is the complete set of @xmath21 . here",
    "the terminology ` strategy ' is consistent with the one used by eisert et al.2 . and",
    "the operation of a player is the probabilistic mixture of the pure quantum strategies . we show that if both players resort to mixed quantum strategy , although there are still many profiles of nash equilibria , the possible tactic mismatch will have no influence on the players .",
    "so the dilemma which exists in the traditional _ battle of the sexes game _ is removed .",
    "our physical model for quantizing the game is similar to the delicate scheme introduced by eisert et al.@xcite .",
    "figure 1 indicates the flow of information in the _ battle of the sexes game_.it is composed of a source of two bits , one bit for each player .",
    "@xmath22 represents the state of going to opera and @xmath23 represents the state of watching tv .",
    "the state of the game is described by a vector in the tensor product space which is spanned by the basis @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the first entry refers to alice state and the second to bob. gate @xmath28 is a unitary operator and consist of a hadamard gate and a c - not gate .",
    "so the prepared state after gate @xmath28 is@xmath29so the density matrix of the initial state is @xmath30the strategies of alice and bob are denoted by unitary operator @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "alice and bob independently operate on her / his qubit with @xmath31 and @xmath33 respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath33 are chosen from the strategy space @xmath34 . considering the possible strategies of the players , the strategy space @xmath34 should be all of @xmath35 , and the general expression of the unitary operator is @xmath36with @xmath37 .",
    "we set @xmath38 as the probability of the operator @xmath39 which will be chosen by the players .",
    "naturally @xmath38 is a probability density function with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "here we use the invariance of the haar measure , assumed to be normalized so that the volume of @xmath21 is @xmath42 .",
    "the probabilities of alice choosing @xmath31 and bob choosing @xmath43are denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "so after the strategy moves of alice and bob , the final density matrix @xmath46the payoff operators for alice and bob are@xmath47the expected payoffs of alice and bob are mean values of these operators and hence are functional of @xmath48 and @xmath49.@xmath50 du_{a}du_{b }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\dint_{a}\\dint_{b}f_{a}f_{b}\\$_{a}\\left ( u_{a},u_{b}\\right ) du_{a}du_{b } \\label{eq 7 } \\\\",

    "now we investigate nash equilibrium in this game .",
    "the definition of nash equilibrium @xmath66 for pure strategy in two - player games can be expressed as the following inequalities@xmath67when extended to the mixed strategies ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , the nash equilibrium profile @xmath68 can be expressed as follows@xmath69it is obvious that @xmath70 . by using calculus of variations to the equation([eq 14 ] ) , we obtain the following equations:@xmath71where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constant . from equation([eq 7],[eq 8 ] ) , the left hand of the equation([eq 15 ] ) can be rewritten as follows@xmath74from above calculation , we get the following equation.@xmath75here , the left hand of equation @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) is a constant independent of @xmath31 and @xmath33 , but the right hand of equation([eq 17 ] ) generally depends on @xmath31 ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "the equation has o solution without the guarantee of @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) that there is no @xmath78 in the result of the integral of @xmath51 ( or @xmath79 ) . on the other hand",
    ", any @xmath80 and @xmath76 which meet the guarantee of @xmath76 ( or @xmath80 ) will be solution of equation([eq 17 ] ) , and the profile @xmath81 will be one of the nash equilibria of the game .",
    "when alice s mixed strategy is @xmath64 and bob s is @xmath82 , neither of them can increase her / his payoff by unilaterally changing her / his own strategy .    the solutions of equation ( [ eq 17 ] )",
    "are obviously infinite , that means there is no unique stable strategies .",
    "however , the possible tactic mismatch will have no influence on the players because for any @xmath64 which satisfies equation([eq 17 ] ) will yield @xmath83 du_{a }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\lambda _ { a}\\dint_{a}f_{a}^{\\ast } du_{a }   \\label{eq 19 } \\\\",
    "& = & \\lambda _ { a}\\end{aligned}\\]]so the payoff for alice ( @xmath84 ) is not related to her own strategy ( @xmath64 ) but her opponent s strategy(@xmath65 ) .",
    "similarly the payoff for bob ( @xmath85 ) is @xmath73 , which is not related to his own strategy ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is apparent that for any combination of @xmath64 and @xmath65 which belongs to the stable strategies ( solutions of equation([eq 17 ] ) ) , the payoffs for alice is @xmath72 and for bob is @xmath73 .",
    "further more , through the following caculation we find that the payoffs of alice and bob is the same ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "so the players will not worry about the occurrence of tactic mismatch .",
    "then the dilemma in the classical _ battle of  the sexes game _ is removed .    from the expression of @xmath87 in equation([eq 2 ] ) , the normalized invariance of the haar measure is @xmath88so the integration on the right hand of the equation([eq 17 ] ) can be rewritten as integration with respect to @xmath87 . for any @xmath89 which satisfies the equation([eq 17 ] ) , we get @xmath90 being independent of @xmath33 , hence @xmath91 is independent of @xmath33 . from the expression of @xmath92(see equation([eq",
    "11])),after integrating with respect to @xmath93 , the values of the integration of the terms that contain @xmath94 is zero .",
    "so we get @xmath95repeating the same procedure , we obtain that @xmath96 .",
    "according to the payoff functions of @xmath51 and @xmath79 ( see equation([eq 12 ] ) ) , finally the payoff to both players is @xmath97 .",
    "we list four of the simplest solutions(nash equilibria ) in the following table : @xmath98any strategy in the table is a stable solution .    in the classical _ battle of the sexes game",
    "_ , there are two nash equilibria : @xmath2 and @xmath3 . if the tactic mismatch occurs , the strategic profile becomes @xmath99 or @xmath100 and the payoffs turn out to be the worst - case payoff @xmath101 . in the quantum version of this game , there are more than one nash equilibrium appearing when players adopted the deterministic strategies ( see in ref@xcite ) , and any tactic mismatch can lead to the worst - case payoffs . while when we propose that if the players adopt quantum mixed strategies , it can be guaranteed that the possible appearance of the tactic - mismatch will have no effect on the payoffs of the players , and the payoffs will always remain as @xmath102 .",
    "in this paper , the problems existing in the previous quantum _ battle of the sexes game _ are studied in detail .",
    "we proposed a new scheme , applying mixed quantum strategies , to quantize this game . in our scheme",
    ", the players can choose their strategies in the all of @xmath21 .",
    "it means that there is no restriction on the quantum mechanically possible manipulations of the players .",
    "we show that if the players resort to the mixed quantum strategy , in the game the equilibria that they reach will be much more efficient than that in its classical version .",
    "furthermore , the tactic - mismatch which is the difficulty faced by the players in the traditional game@xcite has no effect on the payoffs of the players .",
    "thus the dilemma which exists in the classical _ battle of the sexes game _ is truly removed .",
    "the scheme of mixed quantum strategy proves successful .",
    "we also hope that the scheme of mixed quantum strategy can be useful for the investigation of other quantum games ."
