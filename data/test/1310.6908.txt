    "one of the various statements of the second law of thermodynamics is the kelvin - planck formulation : no process is possible whose sole result is the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical work .",
    "one consequence of this is the following .",
    "take a system which is initially in thermal equilibrium , but then isolated from the environment .",
    "there is no way to reduce on average the energy of the system by any cyclic variation of external parameters . if this were possible , one could then reconnect the system with the thermal bath and return it to the initial state with the only result that some of the initial thermal energy was extracted as mechanical work in contradiction with the second law .",
    "in fact , since the system is to be isolated during the time when energy is to be extracted , this is a statement about the possible time evolution of a dynamical ( hamiltonian ) system with a certain distribution of initial conditions .",
    "indeed , it can be directly proven from properties of hamiltonian systems @xcite and is true not only for the canonical distribution of initial states , but for any distribution function which is a monotonically decreasing function of energy @xcite .",
    "recently , the violation of this statement in the case of a microcanonical ensemble of systems was discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "that is , if you know the initial energy of the system ( but not the precise initial state ) , you can find a cyclic variation of external parameters such that the average energy of the system is reduced , and therefore work on average extracted .",
    "but a canonical ensemble can be `` converted '' to a microcanonical one by a measurement of the energy .",
    "this idea was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a model is constructed which consists of a single particle in a one - dimensional potential @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the position of the particle ) .",
    "it is then shown that if you measure the energy you can find a cyclic variation of the potential which reduces the energy of the system as close to zero as you wish .",
    "the initial energy of the particle is then delivered as work @xmath0 to the agent operating the potential .",
    "an explicit protocol is given for the evolution of the potential in the case where the initial potential is quartic , @xmath6 , but the procedure is easily extended to other potentials by adding a step that transforms the initial potential adiabatically to a quartic one , whereby the ordering of the different energy states is kept similarly to what is exploited in @xcite , and then performing the cyclic operation they presented .",
    "they consider the following sequence of steps :    1 .",
    "the system is brought into contact and allowed to equilibrate with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the reservoir is then removed .",
    "2 .   the energy of the now - isolated system is measured .",
    "the system is subjected to a cyclic protocol that reduces its kinetic energy close to zero , extracting on average the work @xmath0 .",
    "this sequence can be repeated indefinitely , and thereby one has constructed a device which converts thermal energy into mechanical work , in seeming contradiction to the second law .",
    "the resolution if the inconsistency is found in landauer s principle @xcite , which states that the erasure of information by necessity results in dissipation of heat .",
    "that is , to erase the information obtained when mesuring the energy of the system , and restore the mesuring device to the initial state , one needs on average an amount of work @xmath1 which is converted to thermal energy . in @xcite",
    "it is explicitly shown that we have @xmath8 this means that to erase the information one needs at least as much energy as one extracted from the thermal bath by the operation of the device .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite shows how the second law is not violated by such a device , but it leaves several puzzles . in order to efficiently extract work from the system it is necessary to know the energy accurately .",
    "but an accurate energy measurement means a large amount of information .",
    "it seems that @xmath9 in the limit of very precise energy measurements . at the same time , @xmath0 is bounded by the average energy of the system at the time of the measurement .",
    "is there some optimal accuracy with which the energy should be measured in order to extract as large a fraction of the energy as possible while still not having to pay too much in deleting the information ? and since the probability of a certain energy depends on the energy , are there some regions in energy where it is more important to make accurate mesurements ?",
    "it is also interesting to understand why in eq .",
    "we sometimes have an inequality , rather than strict equality .",
    "in other words , where in the process is there an irreversible step which leads to a net increase of the entropy ? in this paper we will address these questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the model and find the extracted work and measured information .",
    "different ways of optimizing the extracted work are discussed in sec .",
    "[ optimal ] , and a protocol for reversibly completing the whole operation in sec .",
    "[ reversible ] .",
    "a short summary and discussion is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we use the model of vaikuntanathan and jarzynski  @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a single particle with coordinate @xmath5 and momentum @xmath10 in a potential @xmath4 . in ref . @xcite",
    "they choose @xmath11 .",
    "the particle is in thermal equilibrium at a certain temperature @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that we can mesure the energy of the particle to a certain accuracy .",
    "more precicely , we define a number of energies @xmath12 between 0 and some maximal energy @xmath13 and we assume that we can measure in which interval @xmath14 $ ] the energy lies . depending on the outcome of the measurement , we choose an appropriate manipulation protocol .",
    "the manipulation consists in adiabatically modifying the shape of the potential through a closed path in the space of potentials , returning it in the end to the initial one , the exact protocol is given in ref .",
    "the end result is that the states which initially were in the interval @xmath15 are shifted to the lowest energies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : energyexchange ] .    the result of applying the protocol appropriate for an initial energy in the interval @xmath15 .",
    "the manipulation protocol chosen will shift this interval to the lowest energies , and pushing those below up . ]    moreover , the ordering of the states inside the interval @xmath15 is kept , so that a state with a lower initial energy will also have a lower final energy .",
    "this means that we can find the final energy @xmath16 of a particle with initial energy @xmath17 when the protocol appropriate for an energy in the interval @xmath15 is executed .",
    "if @xmath18 is the density of states in the potential @xmath4 we have @xmath19 and @xmath16 is found by solving this equation . in the case of a one - dimensional system in a quadratic potential @xmath20",
    "the density of states is a constant , @xmath21 , and we obtain a particularly simple equation which gives @xmath22 in the following we will derive all general equations for an arbitrary potential , but we will only find solutions in this special simple case .    when we know @xmath16 we can find the energy which on average can be extracted with a given @xmath23 and @xmath13 : @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the partition function . if @xmath26 is the probability that the energy is in interval @xmath15 , we have @xmath27 here @xmath28 where we identify @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 is the probability that @xmath32 and we assume that the device will not operate in this case .",
    "the information obtained during a measurement is on average @xmath33 if the information is to be erased at a heat bath of temperature @xmath34 , the corresponding work of erasure is @xmath35 , and eq .",
    "is valid when @xmath36 .",
    "let us assume that the maximal energy @xmath13 is fixed and represents the upper limit of what our device can operate on .",
    "if the energy is found to be above this value we can not extract it .",
    "if the density of states does not grow too quickly , the probability of this happening decreases quickly with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the free parameters of the model are then the number @xmath23 of energy intervals and the positions @xmath37 of the interval boundaries .",
    "there are several ways one can consider to optimize these .",
    "the simplest is to find the maximal amount of energy @xmath0 which can be extracted in a single run of the cycle presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , and is analyzed in sec .",
    "this means that we are disregarding the work of erasure , @xmath1 .",
    "we can also define the useful work @xmath38 , which according to eq .",
    "is negative when @xmath36 . in sec .",
    "[ optimal ] we discuss how to maximize the useful work or minimize the information needed at a specified extracted work @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we can consider erasing the information at a temperature @xmath39 , in which case the device will operate as a heat engine between the two thermal baths .",
    "one can then define the efficiency @xmath40 in the ordinary way as the ratio of the useful work to the energy extracted from the thermal bath . in sec .",
    "[ he ] we will show that one can get the efficiency arbitrarily close to one but only in the limit where @xmath41 , that is by doing nothing , and we will find the optimal efficiency at at given @xmath0 .",
    "how much energy can on average be extracted with a given @xmath23 and @xmath13 ? to find this we have to maximize the work @xmath0 given by eq .   as a function of the energies @xmath37 marking the boundaries of the energy intervals . in appendix [ a1 ]",
    "it is shown that if we consider the simplest case of @xmath43 the energy intervals @xmath44 have to satisfy the equation @xmath45 this equation can be solved numerically , but in appendix [ a1 ] it is also shown how to derive an approximate solution in the limit of large @xmath23 .",
    "the result is that for @xmath46 we have @xmath47 using this we find @xmath48 @xmath49 which shows that in the limit of large @xmath23 we get @xmath0 close to the average internal energy of @xmath7 as given by the equipartition theorem , and that @xmath1 will grow logaritmically with @xmath23 .      in the previous section we found the position of the @xmath37 such that the extracted work , @xmath0 , was maximized for a given @xmath13 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , to extract this energy we have to obtain a certain amount of information which later has to be deleted .",
    "it is therefore possible that by extracting an energy @xmath51 a bit less than the maximal found above , we can reduce the information and therby the work of erasure , @xmath1 , so that the amount of useful work @xmath38 could be increased .",
    "this means that we should look for other values of @xmath37 which minimzes the information for a given @xmath0 . introducing the lagrange multiplier @xmath52 we define the function @xmath53 we have to minimize this function subject to the constraint constraint with a specified @xmath0 . in appendix  [ a2 ] it is shown that this leads to the equations @xmath54 and the constraint @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have solved these equations numerically , using newton s iterative method . numerically solving these equations is complicated by the fact that there are in general several solutions . by choosing a large number of initial guesses for the solution we can by reasonable security find the solutions with the smallest necessary information , @xmath58 . to make the structure clearer , it is instructive to use the not too large value @xmath59 for the maximal energy",
    ". it is also helpful to subtract the expected entropy , @xmath60 , according to eq . as explained in eq . .",

    "we can observe the following : starting from one of the dots of maximal @xmath0 for a given @xmath23 , we can see that the reduction in @xmath58 that can be achieved by increasing @xmath23 at the same @xmath0 remains close to constant , at least for the range of @xmath23 studied . also , following each curve from the dot , we see that as it crosses the curves for larger @xmath23 , those curves makes a jump . for example , the @xmath62 curve crosses the @xmath63 curve around @xmath64 , and the @xmath63 curve jumps at that point .",
    "this is because as @xmath0 is reduced , the @xmath63 minimal solution has one @xmath65 which vanishes at that point . for smaller @xmath0",
    "this solution is not found ( it is at the boundary of the domain , and not at an interior point ) , while the @xmath62 solution represents the true minimum .      using the same data we can also demonstrate that there does not exist any optimal efficiency except the trivial solution of doing nothing , as discussed above .",
    "the efficiency is @xmath66 which means that we can make the efficiency higher by making the ratio @xmath67 smaller . in fig .",

    "the process discussed leads to a curious situation .",
    "we have a system in thermal equilibrium",
    ". then we decouple it from the environment and make a measurement on it .",
    "that is , we gain information about the system ( the energy interval which it is in ) , thereby increasing our knowledge and reducing the entropy of the system accordingly . in principle , if the measurement process is dissipation - free , this process is reversible , and the amount of information gained is equal to the reduction in entropy . then we manipulate the system in a deterministic way , extracting energy . during this process",
    "it is assumed that the system remains isolated from the environment .",
    "therefore the entropy is constant by liouville s theorem .",
    "the information is then erased , and this is also a reversible process in the sense that the energy that needs to be dissipated as heat increases the entropy of the environment by exactly the same amount as the infomation which is deleted .",
    "the whole process is then completely reversible . yet ,",
    "if the information is deleted at the same temperature as the system had initially , we have seen that there will be a net conversion of energy from mechanical energy to thermal energy : @xmath74 .",
    "how can this be ?",
    "the answer is that the system initially was in thermodynamic equilibrium , but after the process it is not .",
    "this means that we have not utilized all the information that we gained during the measurement .",
    "we have only extracted as much as possible of the energy that was stored in the system at the moment it was decoupled from the reservior . at the end , we are left with a system that has lower entropy than when it started .",
    "it means that it is a resource for extracting energy from a thermal reservoir , if it can be reconnected to one . in order to fully exploit the information that we gained during measurement",
    ", the system has to be returned reversibly to its initial thermal state _ before _ we delete the information .",
    "if we do not do this but rather delete the information and reconnect the system to the bath directly , this will be an irreversible process , and this is where entropy is generated .",
    "returning to the steps in the process as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] we see that it is in going from step ( 3 ) and back to step ( 1 ) that the irreversible process takes place .",
    "we now describe how to add two further steps to the process , so that the whole cycle becomes reversible and equality @xmath75 of the work of erasure and the total extracted work is restored .    1 .   in the initial state ,",
    "the system is in thermal equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the potential is @xmath4 and the average energy is @xmath76 and the entropy @xmath77 .",
    "we decouple the system from the bath and measure in which interval @xmath15 the energy lies .",
    "the average energy ( which is both thermal average and average over measurement results ) is not changed , @xmath78 , as it has to be since we have only measured and not changed the energy .",
    "the average entropy is @xmath79 where @xmath58 is the average information gained by the measurement .",
    "we manipulate the potential in the way described in sec .",
    "[ model ] , bringing the interval @xmath15 to the bottom of the potential and returning the potential in the end to @xmath4 .",
    "the average energy is @xmath80 and the entropy still @xmath81 since it can not change in an adiabatic process in an isolated system . during this operation",
    "the work @xmath82 is extracted as considered in previous sections .",
    "it is the maximal work which can be extracted keeping the system isolated .",
    "4 .   to reversibly return the system to the initial state we first modify the potential adiabatically in such a way that the distribution function is thermal at the right temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this means that we have to find a potential @xmath83 with a corresponding density of states @xmath84 such that after the process the particle is left with a distribution function of the energy @xmath85 such that @xmath86 note that the potential @xmath83 will in general depend on the interval @xmath15 where the system energy was found to be .",
    "the form of the potential can in principle be found , but we do not need it .",
    "it is sufficient to know that it exists , which seems clear at least for simple potentials with a single minimum .",
    "the average energy is @xmath87 and the entropy is still @xmath81 .",
    "this process requires a work @xmath88 .",
    "it is negative since the energy of the system has to increase since we know that initially it is close to the bottom of the potential .",
    "we have to use external work to achieve this , but it prepares the system for the last step where a larger amount of work is extracted from a thermal reservior .",
    "finally we can now safely reconnect the system to the bath , which is a reversible process and does not change anything on average , since the system already is prepared in a thermal state .",
    "we can then adiabatically return the potential to the initial @xmath4 .",
    "this gives the same average energy @xmath76 and entropy @xmath77 as in the initial state .",
    "the process produces the work @xmath89    the total work obtained in the full cycle is @xmath90 which according to landauer s principle is exactly the energy that must be dissipated to erase the information obtained in the measurement .",
    "this statement is true for any number of energy intervals in the measurement scheme and any set if interval boundaries @xmath37 .",
    "the only requirement is that all processes are adiabatic , which means that they have to be performed infinitely slowly .",
    "we have discussed the model of vaikuntanathan and jarzynski @xcite for extracting work from a thermal bath by measuring the energy of a particle that was thermalized with the bath and manipulating the potential of this particle in the appropriate way , depending on the measurement outcome .",
    "we have addressed the question of how accurately the energy should be measured .",
    "this is formalized in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite by dividing the energy axis in subintervals @xmath15 and assuming that the measurement tells with perfect accuracy in which interval the energy is .",
    "we have optimized the boundaries @xmath37 of the intervals according to different criteria : for extracting the maximal energy , for minimizing the entropy production and for maximizing the efficiency of a heat engine at a given power .",
    "we have identified the irreversible step in the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite as the one where the system is known to be close to the lowest energy state and is reconnected with a thermal bath .",
    "in this process the available phase space of the particle suddenly increases , and the process is irreversible and there is a net increase in entropy .",
    "this is in principle the same situation as in the paradigmatic example of free expansion of an ideal gas following a sudden increase in the accessible volume . in the context of information driven heat engines ( maxwell s demons ) similar situations has been recently discussed . in ref .",
    "@xcite an overdamped particle in a potential was considered and the potential was manipulated in order to extract energy following the measurement of position .",
    "it was found that to get the maximal work possible by the measured information one had to strongly confine the particle initially close to the measured position and then gradually make the potential less steep while extracting energy . in the context of single electron devices  @xcite",
    "it was found that when opening the barrier between two possible states for a particle , this has to be done in an optimized way so that at no point will the available phase space suddenly increase .",
    "similarly , in this paper we have described a protocol whereby the irreversible step in ref .",
    "@xcite can be reversibly performed , thereby incresing the extracted work up to the maximal achievable by the measured information , so that the extracted work is exactly the same as what is needed in order to erase the information in accordance with landauer s principle .",
