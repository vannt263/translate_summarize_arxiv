    "these spherical truncation approaches can be surprisingly accurate , but standard estimates of thermodynamic properties in the bulk liquid are less satisfactory  @xcite .",

    "much current research is focused on developing more efficient implementations such as particle - mesh ewald  @xcite and in removing some of the artifacts that may arise from the use of periodic lattice sums in fluid environments  @xcite .",
    "but is it possible to build on the success of spherical truncations of @xmath0 interactions in uniform environments  @xcite and to understand and correct their failures in nonuniform environments  @xcite ?",
    "we show that local molecular field ( lmf ) theory  @xcite offers exactly that opportunity .",
    "lmf theory corrects naive truncation schemes by introducing an effective electrostatic potential @xmath5 that accounts for the remaining effects of the long - ranged interactions .",
    "lmf theory also suggests a particularly effective smoothed gaussian - truncation scheme for the charges in spc / e water and other interaction - site molecular models .",
    "furthermore , the theory provides a general conceptual framework that permits a qualitative as well as quantitative understanding of the effects of long - ranged coulomb interactions on local water structure  something that is often obscured in black box application of lattice summation techniques .    we will briefly discuss the application of the gaussian - truncation scheme to bulk spc / e water",
    ". then we will demonstrate that the inclusion of the effective potential @xmath5 given by lmf theory is the sole modification of molecular dynamics simulations of gaussian - truncated ( gt ) water required to yield accurate minimum image simulations of water in nonuniform slab environments .",
    "while we focus on systems composed of solely water molecules and simple confinement potentials , we argue below that the lmf approach is relevant for the treatment of electrostatics in general biomolecular simulations .",
    "in lmf theory , we split the @xmath0 potential associated with each charge into rapidly - varying ( @xmath6 ) and slowly - varying ( @xmath7 ) components as @xmath8 this potential separation isolates strong short - ranged and rapidly - varying interactions in @xmath2 , and the remaining slowly - varying long - ranged forces are encompassed by @xmath9 .",
    "this interaction @xmath9 is proportional to the electrostatic potential arising from a smooth normalized gaussian charge distribution with width @xmath10 , and is defined via the convolution @xmath11 thus @xmath12 is slowly - varying in @xmath13-space over the _ smoothing length _",

    "neither the point charges nor the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential describing the molecular cores are perfect representations of actual water interactions but adjusting the constants makes the total potential quite reasonable for temperatures and densities of interest .    since the charges generating the local hydrogen bonding network in water are very strongly coupled , a reasonable first approximation is simply to replace all point - charge interactions by the truncated @xmath2 without employing a @xmath20 .",

    "as argued elsewhere  @xcite , the accuracy of gt water in bulk arises from a strong cancellation of the long - ranged electrostatic forces exerted by surrounding molecules in the uniform bulk on any given molecular site .",
    "these site - based spherical truncations can also yield highly accurate angular correlation functions  @xcite , a property that is missed with molecule - based truncations that do not neglect only slowly - varying forces  @xcite .",

    "classical electrostatic textbooks often posit some sort of smoothing over such local order  @xcite .",
    "this smoothed charge density allows for a more direct analogy between molecular simulations and classical electrostatics .",
    "the lmf approach naturally distinguishes the long - ranged charge - charge interactions representing overall dipolar ordering from the short - ranged charge - charge interactions in simulations that capture hydrogen - bonding and short - ranged polar attraction .",
    "given that any @xmath10 greater than some @xmath43 will describe relevant short - ranged interactions like hydrogen bonding and can be used in simulations , too much significance should not be assigned to the particular chosen @xmath10 value or the exact magnitudes of the resulting @xmath41 .",
    "however we strengthen a previous suggestion  @xcite that charge density profiles reveal electrostatic effects in a less - biased fashion than molecule - based profiles : perhaps a smoothed profile is even less biased .",
    "we now illustrate the application of lmf theory to moderately more realistic molecular surfaces by replacing the hydrophobic walls with empirical pt(111 ) surfaces that order the water molecules at the surface , attracting the oxygen atoms to localized binding sites as shown by berkowitz and coworkers  @xcite . this surface is meant to represent specific interactions and detailed ordering of water molecules at an atomically corrugated surface , thus mimicking a hydrophilic interaction .",
    "the particular wall potential we use does not have explicitly fixed wall charges , but lmf theory can readily handle these as well  @xcite .",
    "since this surface induces a charge density that is explicitly a function of @xmath44 , @xmath24 , and @xmath36 , one might reasonably conclude that we now must solve the full three - dimensional lmf equation given in eq .",

    ", we certainly believe that it could be of use in other physically relevant slab - geometry simulations such as biological membranes and liquid - liquid interfaces .",
    "perhaps it also could help resolve a recent dispute over whether or not depletion of water between capacitor plates occurs in the simulation of an open system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , given previous work treating primitive models of ionic solutions with lmf theory  @xcite , the study of aqueous ionic solutions is another natural step forward .",
    "truncating all @xmath0 interactions via @xmath2 with the same @xmath10 would lead to a natural mimic system for such ionic solutions .",
    "examination of either @xmath20 or the smoothed charge density @xmath41 prescribed by lmf theory also clarifies the underlying electrostatics and the failure of spherical truncations .",
    "the gaussian - smoothed perspective for long - ranged electrostatics greatly elucidates the perceived contradiction between seemingly good charge density profiles but very poor polarization potential profiles for water confined between walls in zero field .",
    "analysis of long - ranged electrostatic properties using the smoothed charge density seems more plausible because the point charges in classical site - site models approximate the real quantum - mechanical electron cloud , and longer - ranged electrostatic effects should be relatively insensitive to the exact placement and magnitude of point charges in models with the same dipole moment .",

    "simulation using gt water without a self - consistent @xmath20 will only be reasonable if the resulting @xmath41 reflects the underlying electrostatics .",

    "<S> spherical truncations of coulomb interactions in standard models for water permit efficient molecular simulations and can give remarkably accurate results for the structure of the uniform liquid . </S>",
    "<S> however truncations are known to produce significant errors in nonuniform systems , particularly for electrostatic properties . </S>",
    "<S> local molecular field ( lmf ) theory corrects such truncations by use of an effective or restructured electrostatic potential that accounts for effects of the remaining long - ranged interactions through a density - weighted mean field average and satisfies a modified poisson s equation defined with a gaussian - smoothed charge density . </S>",
    "<S> we apply lmf theory to three simple molecular systems that exhibit different aspects of the failure of a naive application of spherical truncations  water confined between hydrophobic walls , water confined between atomically - corrugated hydrophilic walls , and water confined between hydrophobic walls with an applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> spherical truncations of @xmath0 fail spectacularly for the final system in particular , and lmf theory corrects the failings for all three . </S>",
    "<S> further , lmf theory provides a more intuitive way to understand the balance between local hydrogen bonding and longer - ranged electrostatics in molecular simulations involving water . </S>"
