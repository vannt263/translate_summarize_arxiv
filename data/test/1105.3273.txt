    "mass - loss from massive stars in the red supergiant phase is fundamental to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "red supergiants , with initial masses of 10@xmath250@xmath3 , are known to lose mass at rates of up to 10@xmath4/yr @xcite .",
    "mass - loss rates are commonly estimated indirectly , using observations of infrared continuum excesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or measurements of co rotational line intensities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "outflowing material is also directly surveyed through observations of systematic spectral line displacements @xcite and interferometric studies over multiple epochs @xcite .",
    "the physical processes involved in red supergiant mass - loss are however not well understood . while mass - loss from less massive stars , such as agb stars , is understood in terms of significant radial pulsations and winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains , such mechanisms are not applicable to red supergiants @xcite , except those in a superwind phase @xcite .",
    "rotation in stars that are spun - up as they condense from protostellar clouds could play a role in driving mass - loss @xcite , as could alfvn and acoustic waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of betelgeuse ( @xmath5 orionis , spectral type m2iab ) , the elevation of cool photospheric gas @xcite and gas at chromospheric temperatures @xcite has been attributed to large - scale surface convective activity @xcite .",
    "betelgeuse is perhaps the archetypal red supergiant .",

    "these spots range in intensity from a few to a few tens of percent of the intensity of the stellar disk .",
    "the detection of these spots is generally interpreted as direct evidence for the presence of a few giant convection cells on the stellar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a profusion of circumstellar components have been identified surrounding betelgeuse .",
    "furthest from the star , an analysis of mid - ir spectra and interferometric data by @xcite showed the presence of two thin shells of dust at approximately 40 and 80 stellar radii ( @xmath7 ) , with temperatures of @xmath1400k and @xmath1200k respectively .",

    "further work by @xcite combining both interferometric and spectroscopic data placed the layer surrounding betelgeuse at beyond @xmath11 , with a temperature of 2250k .",
    "the layer was shown not to be solely composed of water by @xcite , who suggested the presence of amorphous alumina ( al@xmath12o@xmath13 ) to explain the high mid - ir opacity .",
    "the spectrum of water lines from betelgeuse is indeed more complex than revealed by the iso data ; signatures of water at photospheric temperatures were detected by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the source powers were measured using additional 140hz chopping between the source , or the sky , and cold loads with temperatures near that of the sky . a single visibility measurement consisted of either : ( 1 ) a fringe power measured during a chopping / position - switching dataset , normalized using the source powers during that dataset ; or ( 2 ) a fringe power measured during a staring dataset , normalized by weighted averages of source powers measured during the nearest chopping / position - switching datasets .",
    "closure phases were calculated for each triplet of visibility measurements .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for two reasons : radiation at mid - ir wavelengths is strongly affected by thermal emission from circumstellar dust shells and bolometric correction factors at these wavelengths are unique to individual stars ; and also because the correspondance between the 11.15@xmath0 m scattering surface and the photosphere of betelgeuse is not certain .",
    "the calculated effective temperatures for the observed stellar disk of betelgeuse during each observing epoch are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "we do not account for attenuation by the interstellar medium , estimated as modifying the observed flux density by a factor of 0.975 @xcite .",
    "we also do not account for absorption of the stellar radiation by the dust that surrounds betelgeuse at angular scales of 1  or larger , or for the emission from this dust in the line of sight to the stellar face .",
    "this is because the dust shells are extremely optically thin at mid - ir wavelengths when viewed radially , with a total line - of - sight optical depth of approximately 0.0065 @xcite .",
    "our measured effective temperatures of the mid - ir surface of betelgeuse are consistently lower than the value of 3641k derived by @xcite for the photospheric component of a photosphere - and - layer model .",
    "furthermore , significant variability is evident between the effective temperatures measured at different epochs .",
    "we therefore consider sources of mid - ir continuum opacity in the atmosphere of betelgeuse in an attempt to elucidate the scattering surface probed by our observations and the cause of the observed variability .",
    "stellar atmospheres have opacities that vary with wavelength .",
    "stars appear smaller at wavelengths where the atmospheric opacity is smaller .",
    "the surface of a star , when observed at a given wavelength , can be approximated as the location where the optical depth at that wavelength , measured from the observer , is approximately unity .",
    "the photosphere of a star , however , is the apparent stellar surface observed at a wavelength where the opacity matches the rosseland mean opacity @xcite .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the intensity of radiation from a point in a stellar atmosphere , @xmath53 is the temperature at that point , and @xmath54 is the opacity at a frequency @xmath44 .",
    "regions of a stellar spectrum with large radiation intensity but low opacity contribute most to determining the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "@xcite concluded that the mid - ir continuum opacity of a gas with solar atomic abundances under surface conditions present on red giant stars closely matches the rosseland mean opacity of such a gas .",
    "molecular layers surrounding red giant stars have , however , been shown to significantly change the mid - ir opacity from that of a solar abundance atomic gas , while remaining relatively transparent in shorter wavelength ir bands @xcite . the @xcite model for betelgeuse , combining @xmath55-band visibility data and a 11.15@xmath0 m isi visibility curve @xcite , includes a shell with a @xmath55-band optical depth of 0.06 and a 11.15@xmath0 m optical depth of 2.33 .",
    "@xcite showed that this shell was composed of water , amorphous alumina dust and sio gas , and that the 11.15@xmath0 m opacity was dominated by alumina .",
    "the presence of alumina in a layer surrounding betelgeuse , within 1.5@xmath7 , was suggested by @xcite as the only dust species that could condense at the temperatures present in this region .",
    "alumina dust grains forming close to stars possibly play a role as nucleation sites for dust species that condense at lower temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bremsstrahlung interactions between electrons and neutral hydrogen atoms also contribute to the mid - ir continuum opacity in red giant stars @xcite .",
    "this emission mechanism was adduced by @xcite to explain the variation with wavelength of the apparent sizes of the radio photospheres of long - period variables , and ascribed to betelgeuse by @xcite .",
    "we discuss this opacity model further in  3.4 .",
    "prior work , the dramatic variations in apparent mid - ir diameters of betelgeuse , and the low effective temperatures all provide clear motivation to model the new isi observational results in terms of a photosphere and a molecular layer .",
    "our method is similar to that of @xcite in that we modeled a spherically symmetric layer surrounding an opaque stellar photosphere with an assumed diameter of 0.04371  and an assumed surface temperature of 3641k @xcite .",
    "visibility and closure phase models for any observed point sources were subtracted from the data during each observation epoch in order to allow the model to be spherically symmetric .",
    "we did not attempt to fit an asymmetric layer because of the large number of free parameters involved .",
    "the free parameters of our model were : the temperature , @xmath53 , of the layer ; the optical depth , @xmath56 , of the layer along the line of sight to the center of the star ; and , the outer radius , @xmath57 , of the layer .",

    "a model image was generated and integrated along one dimension , and a one - dimensional fourier transform was performed in order to generate a set of visibilities .",
    "each model visibility was compared to measured visibilities that were closest to it ( i.e. , within @xmath69 ) in spatial frequency .",
    "a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm was employed to calculate the free parameter set that minimized the global @xmath40 .",
    "the results of the fit for each observing epoch are given in table 3 .",
    "errors for each parameter were calculated using the resulting covariance matrix . in order to confirm the validity of our analyses , we added the visibility and closure phase models of the point sources , that were earlier subtracted from the visibility data from each epoch , to the best - fit model visibilities .",

    "our values for the hydrogen number density of between @xmath79@xmath80 and @xmath81@xmath80 , using a hydrogen atomic mass of @xmath82 g , are equivalent to mass densities of @xmath83g@xmath80 .",
    "such values are consistent with the hydrogen density derived for the betelgeuse layer modeled by @xcite , where they derived their hydrogen density by assuming a ratio between the h@xmath12o number density and the hydrogen number density of @xmath84 @xcite and using their calculated values of @xmath85 for the layer .",

    "the color brightness of the images is consistent with the same flux density scale , also depicted in figure 4 , and the areas of the disks representing the point sources indicate their flux densities calculated from their fitted fractions of the total intensity .",
    "all point sources are positive in intensity with respect to the star .",
    "non - uniformities on the observed stellar disk of betelgeuse at optical and near - ir wavelengths have been reported by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these asymmetries are generally modeled either as point sources , or as uds or two - dimensional gaussian profiles of fixed , unresolved size .",
    "the intensities of these ` spots ' are generally found to be between 5% and 20% of the intensity of the stellar disk .",
    "the distribution and strengths of the spots are found to vary significantly across optical and near - ir bands during contemporaneous observations @xcite , with the star sometimes appearing featureless in one band and highly non - uniform in another .",
    "the spots are also found to vary on timescales of less than 8 weeks @xcite .",
    "one such spot was recently resolved in the _ h_-band by @xcite , who reported a diameter of 0.011 for this spot .",
    "these results are consistent with a prediction by @xcite for extremely large - scale convection on red giants .",
    "red supergiants are suggested to have only a few tens of convection cells on their surfaces , as opposed to the thousands present on the surface of the sun .",
    "similar predictions also result from three - dimensional numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an initial attempt at matching simulations to interferometric observations was made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted temperature fluctuations of up to @xmath86k with respect to the photospheric temperatures of red giant stars .",
    "this is consistent with the intensities of spots observed in the visible and near - ir .",
    "the point sources fitted to our mid - ir data do not arise directly from large - scale convective features on the surface of betelgeuse .",
    "if we assume a 0.01  diameter for the weakest of our point sources ( see table 2 ) , which contributes 0.7% of the 4400jy flux density of betelgeuse in 2009 , its temperature of @xmath1660k above the effective surface temperature , calculated using equation 2 , is consistent with a photospheric hotspot of @xmath11000k behind the @xmath87 layer .",
    "if we assign a similar diameter to any of the other point sources we observe , even greater temperatures would result for associated photospheric hotspots .",
    "the mid - ir point sources are hence more intense than expected from surface temperature fluctuations caused by giant convection cells @xcite .",
    "furthermore , every one of our point sources is located beyond the edge of the photospheric disk ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "it is clear therefore that the observed asymmetry of betelgeuse in the mid - ir is caused by a non - uniform intensity distribution in the layer .",
    "we do not have sufficient sampling of the @xmath31 plane in any epoch to identify whether the layer is in fact spherically symmetric , but with temperature fluctuations , or whether the layer is extended in particular directions .",
    "the point sources can also be explained in terms of opacity inhomogeneities in the layer . in the rayleigh - jeans approximation to the planck law , the effective radiation temperature , @xmath88 , of a column of material with optical depth @xmath56 and temperature @xmath53",
    "is given by @xmath89 for example , increasing the value of @xmath56 from 1 to 3 increases @xmath88 by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "non - uniform spatial , temperature and opacity distributions of the betelgeuse layer could all explain the observed mid - ir non - uniformities .",
    "molecular layers directly surrounding the photospheres of red supergiant stars , and in particular betelgeuse , have been modeled by a variety of authors under differing assumptions for the layer geometry and the dominant opacity source .",
    "a layer of water with a column density of 10@xmath90cm@xmath49 at a temperature of @xmath11500k was first suggested by @xcite for betelgeuse , based on modeling of near - ir spectra . a combination of spectral and interferometric modeling by @xcite , assuming a layer geometry identical to ours , suggested a layer temperature of 2050k and an outer radius of 1.45@xmath7 , while modeling the mid - ir opacity as being dominated by a continuum of water emission and absorption lines . under the assumption of a layer with a well - defined inner radius",
    ", @xcite modeled a shell beyond 1.3@xmath7 with a temperature of 2250k , again dominated by water opacity .",
    "more advanced spectral modeling by @xcite revealed that water could not play a dominant role in determining the mid - ir continuum opacity , and instead suggested the presence of amorphous alumina in the molecular layer .",
    "this model was consolidated by @xcite to suggest a shell between 1.32@xmath7 and 1.42@xmath7 at a temperature of 1520k .",
    "the properties we derive for a layer surrounding betelgeuse , summarised in table 3 for each observing epoch , are largely consistent with these results .",
    "we find temperatures that vary between 1900k and 2800k and outer radii that vary between 1.14@xmath7 and 1.36@xmath7 .",
    "our modeling technique most closely matched that of @xcite in assuming thermal continuum emission from the layer within our observing band .",
    "this assumption is justified by the featureless spectrum of betelgeuse within , and around , our observing band and by the lack of any significant water lines within and surrounding our band @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with previous models of the betelgeuse layer .",
    "a consistent picture of the composition of the layer has , however , not been achieved . while spectral modeling has uncovered the presence of numerous molecular species , including h@xmath12o , co , sio and possibly cn , as well as alumina dust @xcite , the opacity of the layer as a function of wavelength is not yet fully determined .",
    "our results for the optical depth of the layer of @xmath11 at 11.15@xmath0 m wavelength are not in agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite , who obtain optical depths of @xmath12 .",
    "the number density of atomic hydrogen , based on the 11.15@xmath0 m opacity arising from electron - hydrogen atom collisions , is @xmath110@xmath92@xmath80 .",
    "this density , given the derived layer size , corresponds to h@xmath12o column densities of 10@xmath93cm@xmath49 ; this result is consistent with h@xmath12o column densities measured by @xcite and those derived from spectral modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore suggest that electron - hydrogen atom collisions play a significant role in determining the mid - ir continuum opacity of the betelgeuse layer , and that this mechanism must also be accounted for in models for the layer composition .",
    "we have shown that the layer of material surrounding the photosphere of betelgeuse has a non - uniform intensity distribution .",
    "a similar result was recently reported by @xcite based on interferometric measurements of the one - dimensional intensity and velocity profile of co gas in the inner atmosphere of betelgeuse .",
    "@xcite also reported a change in the one - dimensional co intensity and velocity profile between two epochs spaced by a year .",
    "we find that the intensity distribution of the layer varies between each the five observing epochs we present , which are also spaced by approximately one year .",
    "the non - uniformities that we observe in the layer reflect , on much smaller spatial scales , the non - uniformities observed in various components of the circumstellar environment of betelgeuse . a gaseous component at similar temperatures to the betelgeuse layer",
    "was shown to have an asymmetric intensity distribution by @xcite .",
    "our observations and those of @xcite could be linked by the opacities in both wavelength bands being partly caused by electron - hydrogen atom collisions .",
    "the opacity due to this mechanism is proportional to @xmath94 , implying that the observed stellar size decreases with shorter observing wavelengths .",
    "material at chromospheric temperatures is also observed to be asymmetrically distributed @xcite , and observations of a circumstellar envelope by @xcite at near - ir wavelengths also reveal significant asymmetry .",
    "asymmetry in the large - scale ( @xmath11 ) dust distribution surrounding betelgeuse was also observed by @xcite .",
    "molecular layer models have been applied to the few red supergiant stars that have been observed with sufficient spatial resolution , such as @xmath0 cephei @xcite and @xmath5 herculis @xcite .",
    "similar layers are identified around agb stars @xcite .",
    "the properties of individual red supergiant layers vary significantly from star to star , and a greater sample of measurements is required to understand what determines individual layer properties .      the processes by which red supergiant stars form and accelerate dust , while crucial to mass - loss scenarios , are little understood .",
    "existing models of stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have shown that the basic properties of the layer , given in table 3 , exhibit striking variability from year to year .",
    "the layer is found to decrease in size and increase in optical depth over the years @xmath95 , and increase in size and decrease in optical depth between @xmath96 .",
    "the layer temperature does not show such systematic variability , although the largest layer size ( in 2010 ) does correspond to the highest temperature .",
    "the variability in the apparent mid - ir size of betelgeuse reported by @xcite can also be interpreted to indicate variations in the layers .",
    "intriguingly , a similar phenomenon was reported by @xcite , who noted a decrease in the size of betelgeuse at visible wavelengths followed by an increase .",
    "figure 5 shows measurements of the visual magnitude of betelgeuse during between 2006 and 2010 , as well as the isi measurements of the total 11.15@xmath0 m flux density ( also listed in table 1 ) .",
    "the timespans of the isi observing epochs are also plotted .",
    "the visual magnitude measurements were obtained from the online database of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) .",
    "the data , collected by a multitude of volunteer observers , were averaged over 30-day timespans ; each timespan with less than 10 measurements was discarded .",
    "the visual variability of betelgeuse over our observing epochs was approximately 0.9 magnitudes .",
    "the visual intensity of betelgeuse is not likely to represent that of the photosphere because the apparent stellar diameter at visible wavelengths is greater than that at near - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "also , using contemporaneous interferometric observations of betelgeuse at different wavelengths , @xcite found that hotspots evident in the visible were not present in the near - ir .",
    "observations of betelgeuse at visible wavelengths could represent regions within the layer observed at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "it is interesting that the mid - ir flux density of betelgeuse , as well as the effective temperatures plotted in figure 3 , and the visual magnitude appear somewhat correlated , particularly in their increase during the 2009 and 2010 epochs .",
    "previous authors @xcite have concluded that the visual variability of betelgeuse is probably indicative of quasi - periodic pulsations , and is too great to be explained by variations in the hotspot distribution .",
    "the layer of material surrounding betelgeuse is a candidate location for the onset of dust formation .",
    "a number of authors have identified the presence of alumina dust directly above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the derived physical parameters of the layer , such as the temperatures and hydrogen mass densities , are suitable for the formation of amorphous alumina @xcite . while some aspects of the modeled variability of the layer might be due to variations in the photosphere , measurements of changes in the apparent mid - ir appearance of betelgeuse must be largely caused by variations in the layer .",
    "if alumina contributes significantly to the mid - ir continuum opacity , these variations would represent variations in the dust content of the layer .",
    "our estimates of changes in the mass of the layer , on the order of @xmath97 ( see table 4 ) , might indicate evolution in the layer .",
    "the point sources we observe in the layer of material surrounding betelgeuse and their changes suggest that the layer dynamics are anisotropic .",
    "asymmetries observed in the circumstellar environment of betelgeuse are generally linked to the presence of giant convection cells on the stellar surface .",
    "such convection cells are thought to shape the circumstellar environment of betelgeuse by elevating cool photospheric material @xcite and driving large - scale chromospheric motions @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that giant convection cells have a significant role in shaping the betelgeuse layer .",
    "this is because the mechanism that elevates the layer material above the photosphere is clearly anisotropic .",
    "the large intensities of the observed point - source components imply the action of large - scale photospheric features , and their variability between observing epochs demonstrates the transient nature of the cause of the point sources .",
    "changes in the distribution of convection cells on the photosphere of betelgeuse could also influence the overall layer properties . while the nature of the non - uniform brightness distribution of the layer is yet to be determined",
    ", our observations represent evidence for the role of giant convection cells in shaping the inner atmosphere of betelgeuse .",
    "observations of a sample of red supergiant stars with high spatial resolution and wide bandwidth , over multiple epochs , are necessary to form a general picture for the role of molecular layers in mass - loss processes .",
    "more detailed interferometric imaging of betelgeuse at mid - ir wavelengths is also required to understand the true role of giant convection cells in shaping the layer .",
    "simultaneous visible , near - ir , and mid - ir interferometry could also provide interesting information on correspondences between different regions of the layer .",
    "interferometric studies with both high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution are planned for the isi @xcite , and have been performed at near - ir wavelengths by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such investigations are aimed at revealing the molecular compositions , kinematic structures and true extents of red supergiant layers .",
    "more detailed modeling of layer opacities is also required , taking into account contributions from molecular absorption and emission , dust and electron - hydrogen atom collisions .",
    "upcoming optical and infrared interferometer systems , such as the magdalena ridge observatory interferometer and the matisse instrument at the very large telescope interferometer , as well as high spatial resolution observations with the next generation of extremely large telescopes could finally clarify our understanding of red supergiant mass loss .",
    "the isi has been used to conduct observations of betelgeuse over 2006@xmath22010 in the mid - ir continuum with high spatial resolution . by fitting visibility and closure phase measurements with image models ,",
    "the apparent stellar size was measured at each observing epoch , and up to two point sources were sometimes detected at the edge of the stellar disk .",
    "the results were interpreted in terms of an absorbing layer surrounding an assumed 3641k photosphere .",
    "we have shown that :    1 .",
    "observations during every epoch can be modeled in terms of a layer surrounding the photosphere , with optical depths of @xmath11 at 11.15@xmath0 m wavelength , outer sizes between 1.16@xmath7 and 1.36@xmath7 , and temperatures between 1900k and 2800k .",

    "<S> the layer has an optical depth of @xmath11 at 11.15@xmath0 m , and varies in temperature between 1900k and 2800k and in outer radius between 1.16 and 1.36 stellar radii . </S>",
    "<S> electron - hydrogen atom collisions contribute significantly to the opacity of the layer . </S>",
    "<S> the layer has a non - uniform intensity distribution that changes between observing epochs . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that large - scale surface convective activity strongly influences the dynamics of the inner atmosphere of betelgeuse , and mass - loss processes . </S>"
