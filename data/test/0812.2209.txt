    "the advent of precise and systematic casimir force experiments since the late 90 @xcite has prompted an intense research on the role of the dielectric properties of the involved materials .",
    "although , the lifshitz theory @xcite explicitly requires the dielectric function of the materials , an important issue is which one is the correct dielectric function that is consistent in describing the optical properties of the materials and the measurements of the casimir force .",
    "the first approach is to assume a plasma model for the dielectric function @xcite or the more realistic drude model , that has been extensively used when extrapolating to low frequencies tabulated data .",
    "although it may be thought that the problem of using a dielectric function is straight forward , controversial results have been reported , in particular in relation to the use of the drude model in finite temperature calculations of the casimir force .",
    "the use of of the drude model in lifshitz theory seems to violate nernst heat theorem , while the plasma model presents no problem at all , but is not realistic in the representation of the dielectric properties of metals .",
    "the plethora of papers and comments shows that the issue is far from settled @xcite .    even without considering finite - temperature effects ,",
    "the choice of the dielectric function can change the calculations of the casimir force .",
    "for example , for au samples the drude parameters extracted from tabulated data vary depending on the sample .",
    "the variations on the drude parameters have important implications in the casimir force calculations since difference of up to @xmath1 are obtained@xcite .",
    "a similar result was obtained by svetovoy et al . where @xcite different au samples were prepared under similar conditions with thicknesses ranging from 120 nm to 400 nm . from measured ellipsometry data",
    "it was verified that the plasma frequency varies from 6.8 ev to 8.4 ev for this set of particular samples , changing the casimir force a few percent .",
    "the conclusions of these works show that there is not a standard plasma frequency or damping parameter for au , it is sample dependent and in situ measurements are needed .",
    "experimentally , the effect of thin films on the casimir force was shown experimentally by iannuzzi @xcite who demonstrated that the casimir attraction between a metallic plate and a metal coated sphere depended on the thickness of the coating .",
    "the reduction of size can significantly change the physical parameters of a system . in the case of thin films ,",
    "as the thickness of the film approaches the mean free path , the conductivity show a sharp decrease in its values .",
    "this was shown experimentally by kastle @xcite with au films whose thickness varied from 2 @xmath2 to 70 @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , a conductor - insulator transition is observed as a function of film thickness in au @xcite . as a function of film thickness",
    ", the casimir force decreases with decreasing film thickness until a critical thickness is reached after which the casimir force increases even with decreasing film thickness@xcite .    to further the discussion about the possible factors that influence casimir force calculations , in this paper we introduce a frequency dependent damping @xmath3 in the drude model",
    "this model describes the dielectric properties of thin films and changes if the film has been annealed .",
    "the classical drude model the local dielectric function is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the frequency , @xmath6 the plasma frequency and @xmath7 the damping parameter that is constant for a fixed temperature .",
    "measurements of the dielectric properties of au thin films by m. l. theye @xcite from reflectance and transmittance data showed a deviation from the bulk drude behavior of au .",
    "the deviations from the drude model were explained by introducing a frequency dependent relaxation time due to electron - phonon and electron - ion interactions of the form : @xmath8 however , a more precise correction to the drude model was introduced by nagel @xcite to include the frequency dependence of the damping parameter . it was observed that sample preparation was relevant in the optical behavior of the material , since the measured data was different for annealed and nonannealed samples .",
    "an explanation of the frequency dependent relaxation time with the sample and the role that annealing plays in the optical properties was given by nagel @xcite using a classical two carrier model .",
    "the model assumes that in a thin film sample there are two regions labeled @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "one where the electrons see a perfect lattice , inside crystallites and a second highly disordered region between the crystallites .",
    "the electrons respond differently in each of these regions and have a different damping rate , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and a different plasma frequency @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ignoring local field corrections in the determination of the optical response",
    ", the two carrier model yields an effective damping parameter given by @xmath15^{-1}+\\gamma_b\\left [ 1+\\frac{\\omega_{pa}}{\\omega_{pb } } \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2+\\gamma_b^2}{\\omega^2+\\gamma_a^2}\\right ) \\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "this last expression is general and the behavior observed by they eq .",
    "( [ tauw ] ) is obtained if @xmath17 and @xmath18 . equation ( [ geff ] )",
    "assumes that the effective masses in both regions are the same , thus @xmath19 .",
    "thus the thin film can be modeled by a drude dielectric function with an effective damping constant .    in this paper",
    "we will use the parameters considered by nagel @xcite that fit the experimental data of they @xcite for an annealed and a nonanneald au film .",
    "the parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "@xmath20&@xmath21&@xmath22&@xmath23 annealed&0.0077 & 0.93&@xmath24nonannealed&0.058&1.18&@xmath24    in figure 1 , we plot the effective damping @xmath25 eq . ( [ geff ] ) as a function of frequency for the samples considered by nagel . as expected ,",
    "annealing the film will reduce the number of impurities and the damping constant should be smaller .    to study the effect that a frequency dependent damping has on the casimir force , we consider two plates separated a distance @xmath26 with a thin film deposited on their surface .",
    "the films are described by the parameters given in table .",
    "1 we calculate the reduction factor define as the casimir force calculated using lifshitz formula @xmath27 divided by the casimir force between perfect conductors @xmath28 ; this is @xmath29 .",
    "this is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in these expressions , the factors",
    "@xmath33 are the reflectivities for @xmath34 or @xmath35 polarized light , @xmath36 is the wavevector component along the plates , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    in figure",
    "( 2 ) we show the reduction factor for au samples described by a classical drude ( @xmath39 ) model where the damping is constant , and the drude model with a frequency dependent damping parameter for an annealed ( @xmath40 ) and nonannealed samples ( @xmath41 ) . for the classical drude model the parameters are @xmath42@xmath43 and @xmath44@xmath43 .",
    "the difference between the annealed and nonannealed sample is small .",
    "the reduction factor increases as compared to the annealed and nonannealed samples .",
    "the difference in reduction factor can better be seen by computing the percent difference @xmath45 as a function of the separation between the plates . at large separations ,",
    "the percent difference is at most of @xmath46 for the nonannealed sample and @xmath47 for the annealed film .",
    "the goal of high - precission measurements at small separations of the casimir force , requires that the dielectric function of the materials are well known . in this paper",
    "we have considered the effects of the frequency dependent damping when au films of a few hundreds of angstroms are considered . besides , the effect of sample preparation such as annealing the film also changes the casimir force .",
    "although the changes are of less than @xmath48 at large separations , we wish to point out that this is an example where using a simple drude model , for example , to extrapolate to low frequencies tabulated data , is not granted unless thick films are used .",
    "this is important if high precision measurements are seek .",
    "furthermore , preparing a sample in ultra high vacuum can change the optical properties of the au films @xcite , showing the need for in - situ determination of the dielectric properties of the samples used in casimir experiments .",
    "finally , the relevance of the frequency dependent damping parameter is in the finite - temperature effects , since now the damping will also depend on the matsubara frequencies",
