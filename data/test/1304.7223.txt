    "we consider the problem of calculating the branch cuts of expressions in a single complex variable . when defining multi - valued functions mathematicians have a choice of where to define the branch cuts .",
    "there are standard choices for most well - known functions @xcite , usually following the work of abramowitz and stegun .",
    "these choices were justified in @xcite and match the choices within the computer algebra programme maple for all elementary functions except arccot ( for reasons explained in @xcite ) . within this paper",
    "we assume branch cut definitions matching those of maple ( which may be observed using maple s ` functionadvisor ` by giving the function name without an argument ) .",
    "we note that a different choice would not lead to any fewer or less complicated issues .",
    "handbooks ( including online resources such as @xcite ) and software usually stop at these static definitions .",
    "however , our thesis is that this knowledge should be dynamic ; processed for the user so it is suitable for their situation . hence we consider the problems that follow after the initial choice of definition",
    "is settled .",
    "this will involve symbolic computation but is also an issue of mathematical knowledge management ( following the _ process view _ of mkm in @xcite ) .",
    "we wish to axiomatically understand the branch cuts of _ expressions _ in multi - valued functions , such as functions applied to a non - trivial argument , function compositions , and function combinations ( sum , product , relations ) .",
    "many of the well - known formulae for elementary functions , such as addition formulae for inverse trigonometric functions , are such expressions .",
    "care needs to be taken when working with multi - valued functions since there are different , often unstated , viewpoints possible as discussed in @xcite .",
    "most computer algebra software ( and indeed most users ) tend to work with multi - valued functions by defining their single - valued counterparts which will have discontinuities over the branch cuts . as a result ,",
    "relations true for the multi - valued functions may no longer be true for the single valued counterparts and hence understanding the branch cuts of the relations becomes essential for working with them efficiently .    despite the importance of understanding such branch cuts , the authors are not aware of any ( available ) software which calculates them beyond the original definitions",
    ". it also seems rare for them to get a detailed mathematical study in their own right , beyond their introduction and simple examples , with @xcite one notable exception .",
    "we denote multivalued functions evaluating to sets of values using names with upper cases ( i.e. arctan , sqrt@xmath0 , log ) and denote their single valued counterparts by the normal notation ( i.e. @xmath1 ) .",
    "so , for example , sqrt@xmath2 while @xmath3 .",
    "( given our above choice of branch cut definitions , this now means our notation throughout the paper matches the commands in maple . ) we note that when dealing with sets of values for multi - valued functions not all combinations of choices of values of will be meaningful and sometimes the choices for sub - expression values are correlated .",
    "a simple example of the problem described above is that while the identity @xmath4 is true ( in the sense that the set of all possible products of entries from the two sets on the right is the same as the set on the left ) , the single valued counterpart @xmath5 is not universally true ( for example when @xmath6 ) .",
    "the regions of truth and failure are determined by the branch cuts of the functions involved .",
    "the standard choices for branch cuts of the elementary functions are reasonably simple , always taking portions of either the real or imaginary axes .",
    "indeed , all the branch cut definitions within maple adhere to this rule ( including those from outside the class of elementary functions ) .",
    "however the branch cuts invoked by the expressions built from these can be far more complicated .",
    "consider for example the composite function @xmath7 which is a term from the double angle formula for @xmath8 . while @xmath9 has simple branch cuts ( when @xmath10 takes values along the real axis , to the left of @xmath11 and to the right of @xmath12 ) , the branch cuts of the composite function are curves in the complex plane as demonstrated by the plot of the function on the left of figure [ fig : arcsin ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    the cuts can be described by the four sets below which are visualised in the image on the right of figure [ fig : arcsin ] .",
    "@xmath13    we have implemented techniques for calculating the branch cuts inherited by functions acting on non - trivial arguments , and extended this to calculate the cuts of expressions and relations of such functions .",
    "the techniques have been gathered together in a maple package , ` branchcuts ` included as part of maple 17 and accessed via the ` functionadvisor ` tool .",
    "readers with an earlier version can download the code as detailed in appendix [ app : maple ] .",
    "both the sets in ( [ eq : arcsin ] ) and the visualisation on the right of figure [ fig : arcsin ] were produced by the package .",
    "in fact , all the 2d figures in the paper are produced by the package from the output of the branch cut algorithms , while all the 3d figures are numerical plots of either the real or imaginary parts of the expressions in question .",
    "maple s ` functionadvisor ` is a handbook for special functions , designed to be both human and machine readable , and interactive , processing the output to fit the query , @xcite .",
    "it covers topics such as symmetries and series expansions with information for almost all of maple s built in functions . in maple 16",
    "the functionality for branch cut computation was limited .",
    "there existed a table with the defining cuts for most functions in terms of a variable @xmath10 and if a function was given with a different argument it would return the definitions with @xmath10 replaced by that argument .",
    "presenting branch cuts this way could be unintuitive and in some cases incorrect ( for example , when the argument induced its own branch cuts these were not returned ) . in maple 17",
    "queries to ` functionadvisor ` on branch cuts use the ` branchcuts ` package discussed in this paper , and additionally , a variety of options are now available for visualising the cuts .",
    "the primary motivation for the implementation is a wider project at bath on _ simplification_. the aim is to develop the technology for computer algebra systems to safely apply identities for multi - valued functions on their single valued counterparts .",
    "the key idea is to decompose the complex domain using cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( cad ) according to the branch cuts of the functions involved , so that the truth value of the proposed identity will be constant in each region of the decomposition and hence may be tested by a sample point .",
    "this decomposition approach was introduced in @xcite with the method using cad developed in a series of papers ; @xcite .",
    "many of the results are summarised in @xcite with the current state discussed recently in @xcite    in this paper we discuss the implementation of the techniques in maple , and the issues raised . we start in section [ sec : calc ] by giving pseudo - algorithms describing the implementation .",
    "these can produce sets of cuts which are a superset of the actual branch cuts , that is , some of the cuts produced may not actually correspond to discontinuities of the functions .",
    "this led us to a classification of the different types of output , presented in section [ sec : types ] .",
    "while there has been work on calculating branch cuts before , most notably in @xcite , our work goes much further with the careful description of the algorithms , their output and how it may be classified .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : sa ] we consider the use of this work in simplification technology and the effect of the condition that the input to cad be a semi - algebraic set ( list of polynomial equations or inequalities in real variables ) .",
    "finally , some details on using the actual maple package are provided in appendix [ app : maple ] .",
    "although our implementation is in maple , we note that the ideas presented are relevant for any system to compute branch cuts .",
    "we first consider representing branch cuts as portions of algebraic curves in two real variables ; the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable , @xmath10 .",
    "[ ex : rv ] consider the function @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 has branch cuts when its argument lies on the negative real axis hence @xmath16 has branch cuts when @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if we let @xmath19 then this reduces to @xmath20 , with solutions @xmath21 and @xmath22 . hence the branch cuts are as shown in figure [ fig : log ] .     from examples [ ex : rv ] and [ ex :",
    "cv].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   from examples [ ex : rv ] and [ ex : cv].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    this technique is summarised by algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] . in the implementation steps 1 and 2",
    "are performed by calls to ` functionadvisor ` , accessing the table of defining cuts . in step 2",
    "we assume that the defining cuts are portions of either the real or imaginary axis encoded as the choice of which is zero and a range over which the other varies . while not strictly required in theory the assumption is used throughout the implementation .",
    "then in step 6 the semi - algebraic set will consist of one equality and one or two inequalities ( depending on whether the range runs to infinity ) .",
    "each solution in step 7 will consist of an equality defining one of @xmath23 in terms of the other , and a range for the other variable .",
    "step 7 could be implemented with a variety of techniques .",
    "we use maple s standard solving tools and find it most efficient to first solve the equality and then consider each possible solution with the inequalities . in using these tools",
    "we are assuming that maple can identify all the solutions , which is not the case for polynomials of high degree .",
    "however , we find them sufficient for all practical examples encountered .",
    "we extend algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] to study _ combinations _ of functions ( sums , products and relations ) by applying the algorithm to each component and then taking the union of the sets of branch cuts in the outputs , as specified in algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] . in step 3",
    "a suitable algorithm is one beginning bc ",
    "f that accepts @xmath24 as input .",
    "note that the output specification of algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] is looser than that of algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] .",
    "one reason for this is that a combination of functions with branch cuts may have their individual branch cuts intersecting , and if the discontinuities introduced are equivalent then these would cancel out as in example [ ex : comb ] . in section [ sec : types ]",
    "we classify the output of these algorithms , including output relating to these cancellations , ( definition [ def : spurioustypes ] ) .",
    "set @xmath25 to be the functions involved in the expression .",
    "[ ex : comb ] let @xmath27 and use algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] to identify the branch cuts .",
    "first we use algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] to identify the branch cut of the first term as the real axis below @xmath11 and the branch cut of the second to be the real axis below @xmath28 .",
    "hence algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] returns the union ; the real axis below @xmath28 as visualised on the left of figure [ fig : comb ] . however , the function actually only has discontinuities on the real axis in the range @xmath29 as demonstrated by the plot on the right of figure [ fig : comb ] . crossing the negative real axis below @xmath11",
    "does induce a discontinuity in the imaginary part of both terms .",
    "however , those discontinuities are equal and so cancel each other out in the expression for @xmath16 .",
    "from example [ ex : comb].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   from example [ ex : comb].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]      we can extend algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] to let @xmath30 be a rational function by modifying step 7 to multiply up after substituting @xmath31 and @xmath32 into @xmath33 .",
    "the question of zero denominators will only arise if the input @xmath30 itself has a zero denominator and so we might assume this issue would have been dealt with previously .",
    "we can relax the input specification further by allowing nested roots , more specifically , by letting the argument belong to the class of radical expressions in @xmath10 ( expressions built up from @xmath34 and @xmath35{}$ ] where @xmath36 is a natural number greater than 1 ) .",
    "this is because such an argument can be modified to give a rational function from which information on the real and imaginary parts of the original argument can be inferred , a process known as _ de - nesting _ the roots .",
    "hence we can still obtain a semi - algebraic set representing the branch cuts as before .",
    "by de - nesting the roots we may end up with extra solutions which do not define branch cuts of the input function . for example , consider a function with argument @xmath37 which when squared gives @xmath38 , a rational function in @xmath10 .",
    "however , this now represents the solution set @xmath39 , i.e. solutions for both branches of the square root , instead of just the desired principal branch .",
    "ideally these erroneous solutions should be identified and removed .    another issue in relaxing the input specification",
    "is that we must now consider the possibility of extra branch cuts arising from the argument itself .",
    "taking these issues into account , we describe algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] .",
    "this is a modification of algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] with a relaxed input specification , leading to looser output specification",
    ".    set @xmath40bc ",
    "c(@xmath37 ) ( application of algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] ) . @xmath41 .",
    "various methods for de - nesting roots and removing the erroneous solutions have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the ` branchcuts ` package currently has only a very limited implementation of the squaring method outlined above , but further work is planned .",
    "note that even this simple implementation can induce the erroneous solutions discussed as outlined by example [ ex : problem ] .",
    "[ ex : problem ] let @xmath42 and use algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] to identify the branch cuts .",
    "first we set @xmath43 .",
    "then we de - nest by squaring to give @xmath44 . in this simple example , @xmath45 we suppose that @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 since @xmath15 has defining cuts along the negative real axis we know @xmath48 and @xmath49 . upon comparing ( [ eq : simpleex1 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : simpleex2 ] ) we see the second condition implies @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this example",
    "the first condition offers no further information ( if the defining cut had not run to @xmath52 it could have bounded @xmath53 ) .",
    "hence we define the semi - algebraic set @xmath54 .",
    "we also compute the set @xmath55 , which is the branch cut of @xmath37 itself , and return the union of the sets which together specify the entire real axis as presented visually on the left of figure [ fig : problem ] .",
    "unfortunately , the function only actually has discontinuities over the negative real axis , as demonstrated by the plot of the right of figure [ fig : problem ] .",
    "the first solution set was erroneous .",
    "this is clear since if @xmath56 and @xmath50 then @xmath57 and so can never lie on the negative real axis .",
    "the solution related to the case @xmath58 which was not relevant to the problem .",
    "( the reason for the factor of @xmath59 in the example is because maple automatically simplifies @xmath60 to @xmath61 which can be analysed by algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] to give exactly the branch cuts of the function . )     from example [ ex : problem].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   from example [ ex : problem].,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]      we now consider a second approach to representing branch cuts , first suggested by @xcite . rather than moving to real variables",
    "this approach defines cuts using a complex function of a real parameter and a range for that parameter .",
    "[ ex : cv ] let @xmath62 , the function from example [ ex : rv ] .",
    "we consider when @xmath63 takes values on the branch cuts of @xmath64 by setting @xmath65 where @xmath66 ranges over the cuts . in this case",
    "@xmath67 can be easily rearranged to give @xmath68 .",
    "hence we can represent the branch cuts by the two roots , each presented with the range @xmath69 . by considering the behaviour of the functions for various portions of the parameter range",
    "we see that these define the same cuts as presented in example [ ex : rv ] and visualised on the right of figure [ fig : log ] .",
    "this technique is summarised by algorithm [ alg : bc - f - cv ] . in this case",
    "the assumption that the defining cuts are portions of either the real or imaginary axis is really required .",
    "if @xmath37 is a radical expression containing nested roots then step 5 will require de - nesting and so the output may be a superset of the actual branch cuts .",
    "( for example , the set produced for @xmath70 is equivalent to that produced in example [ ex : problem ] . ) note that algorithm [ alg : bc - f - cv ] could have been provided with the input and output specifications of algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] ( i.e if @xmath37 were a radical expression then given sufficient computing resources all the branch cuts could be identified as part of a larger set ) .",
    "instead we have provided the specifications used for the implementation .",
    "this does not restrict the possibilities for @xmath37 , instead building in a warning system to ensure the correctness of the output .",
    "in particular this allows @xmath63 to contain any elementary function , returning not the complete ( possibly infinite ) set of branch cuts but at least those in the principal domain .    set @xmath40bc ",
    "c(@xmath37 ) ( application of algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] ) . @xmath41 .",
    "this approach was simple to implement in maple using the ` solve ` command as a black box for step 5 .",
    "( as discussed before algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] , this is making assumptions on the solve tools which would not always be valid , but they are found to be sufficient for all practical examples encountered . ) the main advantage of this approach over moving to real variables is that it tends to be much quicker , especially when there are nested roots .",
    "the major disadvantage is that the output is usually far more complicated ( requires much more space to display ) , often contains components that map to the same cuts , and is far less intuitive ( the curves encoded are not visible algebraically ) .",
    "example [ ex : kahan ] demonstrates some of these features . despite the often unwieldy output , maple s",
    "plotting features allows for the position and nature of the cuts to be quickly made apparent .    for these reasons",
    "it is expected that the earlier algorithms are more useful for implementation in other code and use in mathematical study while algorithm [ alg : bc - f - cv ] is very useful for getting a quick visual understanding of the branch cuts in an expression and may have much utility in practical applications for this purpose .",
    "[ ex : kahan ] a classic example within the theory of branch cut calculation and simplification is that of kahan s teardrop , from @xcite .",
    "kahan considers the relation @xmath71 noting that it is true for all values of @xmath10 in the complex plane except for a small teardrop shaped region over the negative real axis , as demonstrated by the plot on the left of figure [ fig : kahan ] .",
    "both of the approaches to calculating branch cuts outlined above will return a set represented visually by the image on the right of figure [ fig : kahan ] .",
    "however , the algebraic representations are quite different .",
    "when working in real variables the upper half of the teardrop is represented by the set @xmath72 while using the complex parametric approach the same portion of the teardrop is given by @xmath73{2\\,a-{a}^{3}+2\\,\\sqrt { -{a}^{2 } \\left ( -1+{a}^{2 } \\right ) } } a \\\\ & & \\quad -3\\,\\sqrt [ 3]{2\\,a-{a}^{3}+2\\ , \\sqrt { -{a}^{2 } \\left ( -1+{a}^{2 } \\right ) } } \\sqrt { -{a}^{2 } \\left ( -1+{a}^{2 } \\right ) } -3\\,{a}^{2 } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath74{2\\,a-{a}^{3}+2\\,\\sqrt { -{a}^{2 } \\left ( -1+{a}^{2 } \\right ) } } \\sqrt { 3}a\\\\ & & \\left .",

    "we note that the identity ( [ eq : kahan ] ) in example [ ex : kahan ] is actually introduced by a fluid mechanics problem and so this example demonstrates how issues relating to branch cuts may be encountered by users of multi - valued functions in other fields .",

    "the work of section [ sec : calc ] raises several issues and necessitates a classification of the different cuts that can be produced by these methods .",
    "it is common to use the generic term * branch cuts * to refer to any curve portions that are defining cuts of functions or output from the algorithms .",
    "we classify these , starting with the definition most usually meant by users .",
    "let @xmath75 be an analytic multi - valued function and @xmath64 its single - valued counterpart .",
    "the * branch cuts of the mathematical function * ( called * true cuts * for brevity ) are the curves or curve segments over which @xmath64 is discontinuous , corresponding to @xmath75 moving to another branch of its riemann surface .",
    "hence all the defining branch cuts are true cuts , as are any cuts produced by algorithm [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] . however , as demonstrated by examples [ ex : comb ] and [ ex : problem ] the other algorithms may give output that does not adhere to this definition .    define any branch cuts calculated by the algorithms over which the function is actually continuous as * spurious cuts*.    ( in @xcite the authors used the term _ removable _ instead of spurious , in analogy with removable singularities . ) all branch cuts may be classified as either true or spurious .",
    "we further classify spurious cuts according to their origin .",
    "[ def : spurioustypes ] define those spurious cuts introduced through a de - nesting procedure as * de - nesting cuts * , while those introduced by the intersection of true cuts from different parts of an expression as * formulation cuts*.    hence all spurious branch cuts produced by the algorithms in this paper are either de - nesting cuts or formulation cuts .",
    "some spurious cuts may be both ( or more accurately there may be two cuts , one of each type , which coincide ) .",
    "note that the output of algorithms [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] and [ alg : bc - f - cv ] are collections of true cuts and de - nesting cuts , while the output of algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] is a collection of true cuts , de - nesting cuts and formulation cuts",
    ".    it would be desirable to have algorithms to remove all spurious cuts , or perhaps better , algorithms that do not introduce them in the first place .",
    "there has already been work on the removal of certain spurious cuts in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) and this will be the topic of more study .",
    "we feel that formulation cuts will be the more difficult to avoid since they are inherent to the formulation of the mathematical function chosen in the expression given to an algorithm .",
    "consider @xmath76 when @xmath77 we are in the case of example [ ex : comb ] and applying algorithm [ alg : bc - c ] will result in a branch cut over the real axis below @xmath28 , with the portion between @xmath11 and @xmath28 being a true cut and the rest a spurious cut .",
    "however , if we let @xmath78 differ at all from @xmath28 then the spurious cuts will instantly become true .",
    "the size of the discontinuities will depend on the magnitude of @xmath78 but their presence does not .",

    "none of the algorithms described so far give such output , however algorithms [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] and [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] could be easily modified to do so , by terminating early and returning the output of steps 5 and 6 respectively .",

    "two key commands are available ; ` bccalc ` which produces branch cuts using the algorithms of this paper and ` bcplot ` which can make 2d visualisations of the output .",
    "there are two mandatory arguments for ` bccalc ` ; the expression to be considered and the variable .",
    "the key optional argument is the choice of method .",
    "providing ` method = realvariables ` will cause ` bccalc ` to use algorithms [ alg : bc - f - rv1 ] and [ alg : bc - f - rv2 ] while providing ` method = complexvariable ` will use algorithm [ alg : bc - f - cv ] .",

    "the specification of the algorithms are checked but not strictly enforced .",
    "instead warnings are provided if the method is not applicable or the output can not be guaranteed to contain all true cuts .",
    "the package can work with any function whose defining cuts ( or lack of cuts ) is recorded in the ` functionadvisor ` table .",
    "it covers all elementary functions and many others such as bessel functions , jacobi @xmath84-functions and chebyshev polynomials .",
    "these examples are actually multivariate in a computer algebra sense ( univariate functions with parameters in a mathematical sense ) .",
    "their branch cuts can be considered since they only occur with respect to one variable . if the presence of the branch cuts depends on the value of the parameters then the condition is checked . if it can not be determined true or false ( say if the relevant parameter has not been set ) , then the branch cut is included but a relevant warning is given .",
    "for example ,      produces the message , ` warning , branch cuts have been calculated which ` ` only occur if a::(not(integer ) ) ` , and outputs the six branch cuts @xmath85 applying ` bcplot ` to this output produces the image on the left of figure [ fig : bessel ] .",
    "the true cuts for two specific values of @xmath66 can be observed in the centre and right plots , demonstrating the validity of the warning message ."
