    "electronic transport in mesoscopic systems has been at the focus of experimental and theoretical interest during the last decade due to recent development in fabrication of small electronic devices and their interesting equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties .",
    "especially interesting are the transport properties of a quantum dot ( qd ) under the influence of external time - dependent fields .",
    "the high - frequency signals may be applied to a qd and the time - dependent fields will modify the tunneling current .",
    "new effects have been observed and theoretically described , e.g. photon - assisted tunneling through small quantum dots with well - resolved discrete energy states [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , photon - electron pumps [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] and others .",
    "one can investigate the current flowing through a qd under periodic modulation of the qd electronic structure [ 7 ] or periodic ( non - periodic ) modulation of the tunneling barriers [ 6 ] and electron energy levels in both ( left and right ) electron reservoirs [ 8 ] ( see also [ 9 , 10 ] ) .",
    "the progress of nanomaterials science has enabled the experimental study of the phase coherence of the charge carriers in many mesoscopic systems .",
    "the asymmetric fano line shapes [ 11 ] are observed whenever resonant and nonresonant scattering paths interfere . in some nanostructures ,",
    "e.g. in single - electron transistors , the fano resonances in the conductance were observed [ 12 ] , which imply that there are two paths for transfer of electrons between a source and a drain .",
    "especially the recent experimental and theoretical study with a low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) of the single magnetic atom deposited on a metallic surface showed the asymmetric fano resonances in the tunneling spectra [ 1215 ] .",
    "the stm measurements indicate that in tunneling of electrons between stm tip and a surface with a single impurity atom two different paths are present .",
    "the electrons can tunnel between the tip and the adsorbate state and directly between the tip and the metal surface .",
    "the electronic transport through a qd coupled to the electron reservoirs within a model with two electron tunneling channels was considered in ref .",
    "[ 16 ] and it was shown , that transport of electrons through both channels leads to an asymmetric shape of the zero bias voltage conductance curves , which is typical behaviour for a fano resonance resulting from constructive and destructive interference processes for electrons transmitted through both channels .    in all papers",
    "mentioned above and relating to the electron transport through a qd with the additional ( bridge ) transmission channel the external fields were not applied and the considered systems were driven out of equilibrium only by means of a dc voltage bias . in this paper we address the issue of a qd with a bridge channel between a source and a drain driven out of equilibrium by means of a dc voltage bias and additional time - dependent external fields . in this manner ,",
    "our paper can be seen as generalization of ref . [ 9 ] to the case of a qd with the additional bridge channel in the presence of external microwave fields which are applied to the dot and two leads , respectively . in literature",
    ", different theoretical approaches have been developed to treat the time - dependent , nonequilibrium electron transport processes in the mesoscopic systems .",
    "it seems , that the most popular is the nonequilibrium green s function method .",
    "however , these green s functions depend on the time arguments and for non trivial quantum models it is a rather difficult task to calculate them . in our treatment of the time - dependent tunneling through a mesoscopic system we use the evolution operator technique ( e.g. [ 17 , 18 ] )",
    ". the final expressions for the qd charge and the current flowing in the system can be described in terms of the corresponding matrix elements of the evolution operator .",
    "in our earlier work [ 19 ] we have considered the similar problem solving numerically the corresponding sets of the differential equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the evolution operator . due to the complexity and a large number of these equations we considered only a very limited number of intereting cases although we were able to take into consideration the electronic structure of the lead energy bands and the specific time - dependence of the qd - lead barriers . here",
    "we give the analytical expressions for the qd charge and current assuming so called the wide - band limit approximation and the time - independent strength of the qd - lead barriers . as a result , due to these analytical forms , we are able to analyze the required characteristics of the considered system for the very broad class of parameters . additionally , due to the final forms given for some matrix elements of the evolution operator it is possible to build up the expressions for the qd charge or current in the form of the perturbation series .    in the next section we present the model and formalism and give the resulting expressions for equations for the corresponding matrix elements of the evolution operator . in section 3",
    "we obtain the approximate solutions for all required matrix elements and give the final forms for the qd charge and the current flowing in the system .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 which includes also the summary and a brief discussion .",
    "we model the qd coupled to the left and right electron reservoirs with the additional bridge tunneling channel between them by the usually used hamiltonian @xmath0 , where & & h_1 = _ k _ _ k_(t ) a^+_k _ a_k _ + _ d(t ) a^+_d a_d , + & & v = _ k _ v_k_d(t ) a^+_k_a_d + h.c . + _",

    ", the dot is characterized only by a single level @xmath7 and we have neglected the intradot electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "we assume the case in which there exist microwave fields applied to the leads and qd .",
    "in the adiabatic approximation our time - dependent driven system is described by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , i.e. the energy levels of the leads and qd are driven by the ac field with the frequency @xmath10 and the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .    we describe the dynamical evolution of the charge localised on the qd and the current flowing in the system in terms of the time evolution operator @xmath13 ( in the interaction representation ) which satisfies the equation it u(t , t_0 ) = v(t)u(t , t_0 ) , where & & v(t ) = u_0(t , t_0 ) v(t ) u^+_0(t , t_0 ) , + & & u_0(t ) = t(i^t_t_0 dt h_1(t ) ) . here",

    "the qd charge and currents flowing in the system can be obtained from the knowledge of the appropriate matrix elements of the evolution operator @xmath13 .",

    "the subsequent peaks appear and the distance between them and the central peak is an integer multiple of the frequency @xmath10 ( sidebands ) .",
    "the location of peaks is independent of the amplitude @xmath12 but their relative intensity values change and with increasing @xmath12 the height of the central peak is reduced . for the relatively large amplitude @xmath12 , the heights of the two neighbouring peaks ( at @xmath117 )",
    "are approximately equal to the height of the central peak .",
    "if we take the additional over - dot tunneling channel into consideration , especially for small @xmath12 , the asymmetric shape of the current curve is observed and this asymmetry increases with the increasing strength of the over - dot coupling between both leads . with the increasing amplitude @xmath12 this asymmetry",
    "is reduced largely due to the extra , photon - assisted tunneling peaks whose strength increases with the increasing @xmath12 . for sufficiently large values of @xmath12 and @xmath78 the functional dependence of the average current on the qd energy level @xmath7 is nearly the same for vanishing and non - vanishing over - dot tunneling channels .",
    "there is only one difference  for large @xmath78 the corresponding curve is shifted to the higher values due to the direct channel between both leads .",
    "the last two figures 10 , 11 are devoted to the analysis of the average current @xmath76 dependence on the oscillation period @xmath84 of the external fields . in fig .",

    "the thin ( thick ) curves correspond to @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and the solid ( broken ) curves correspond to @xmath122 ( @xmath98 ) .",

    "11 respectively .",
    "we observe the characteristic average current oscillations damped with increasing @xmath84 for @xmath7 lying in the central part between the left and right chemical potentials ( see also [ 9 ] ) .",
    "these oscillations are present for both @xmath98 and @xmath99 and more visible for greater amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath12 but the maxima and minima of the oscillating average current are localized at the same value of the oscillation period .",
    "note , that the existence of the additional over - dot tunneling channel results approximately in shifting the corresponding curves to higher values without any additional serious modifications . for the qd energy level lying away from the middle point between the left and right chemical potentials ,",
    "the average current is still an oscillating function of @xmath84 although these oscillations are less transparent and their oscillation period is much longer .    to conclude , we have provided a detailed investigation of a qd connected to two leads with an additional over - dot tunneling channel .",
    "the harmonic external microwave fields were considered as applied to the qd and two leads which result in time - dependence of the corresponding qd and leads energy levels . the qd charge and",
    "the average current flowing in this system were calculated within the evolution operator technique .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements of the evolution operator required for the calculation of the qd charge and current were presented in the form of the infinite series of multiple time integrals of the functions containing the information about the coupling between the qd and leads or in the form of the integro - differential equation . applying the wbl aproximation we were able to obtain all required evolution operator matrix elements in closed forms and",
    "give the final analytical expressions for the qd charge and current .",
    "we have performed the extended numerical calculations for the qd charge , the average current and the derivatives of the current with respect to the gate and source - drain voltages ( fig .",
    "the most spectacular influence of the additional bridge tunneling channel is visible in the @xmath76 dependence vs. the position of the qd energy level at the constant source - drain voltage .",
    "going from the vanishing values of the over - dot tunneling channel strength to the non - vanishing one due to the interference effects , the corresponding curve transforms from the symmetric to nearly antisymmetric shape",
    ". similar influence of the non - vanishing @xmath78 is visible in the dependence of @xmath108 vs. @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "the characteristic behaviour of the average current vs. the qd energy level position at the small source - drain voltage is observed for the case when the external oscillating field is applied only to the qd ( fig .",
    "9 ) . for the vanishing over - dot tunneling channel at the small amplitude @xmath12 ,",
    "the main resonant peak is only observed and with the increasing amplitude @xmath12 the next peaks localized at @xmath7 equal to the multiplicity of @xmath10 appear corresponding to the photon - assisted tunneling . in that case",
    "the current is a symmetric curve centered around the main resonant peak . for the nonvanishing over - dot tunneling channel and small amplitudes @xmath12 , the character of the dependence of the average current on the qd energy level position transforms with increasing @xmath78 from the symmetrical to nearly antisymmetrical behaviour .",
    "this tendency to the antisymmetrical behaviour with increasing @xmath78 at small amplitude @xmath12 is reduced with increasing @xmath12 . for sufficiently large amplitude",
    "@xmath12 the overall behaviour of the average current vs. @xmath7 is very similar for different values of @xmath78 and does not manifest the tendency for the antisymmetry with increasing @xmath78 .",
