    "over the past few years , accompanied with the developments of the noncommutative ( nc ) geometry and string theory , quantum hall ( qh ) systems have attracted increasing attentions from particle physicists .",
    "( see @xcite for instance . )",
    "it is well known that the underlying mathematical structure of qh system is nc geometry , and qh systems manifest its exotic properties @xcite .",
    "based on the second hopf map , a four dimensional generalization of qh liquid was constructed in ref .",
    "the system has higher dimensional analogues of the exotic structures of the two dimensional qh system , such as nc geometry , fractionally charged excitations , massless edge states , etc .",
    "since then , many efforts are devoted to the understanding of the four dimensional qh liquid @xcite and the construction of even higher dimensional qh systems @xcite .",
    "the studies of higher dimensional qh systems have brought many fruitful developments in both particle physics and condensed matter physics . particularly , spherical boundstates of d - branes in string theory were well investigated based on the set - up of the fuzzy spheres in higher dimensional qh systems @xcite .",
    "three dimensional reduction of four dimensional qh effect gave a hint to the discovery of the spin - hall effect @xcite , which has become one of the most rapidly growing topics in condensed matter physics .",
    "recently , it was discovered that the non - anticommutative ( nac ) field theory is naturally realized on d - branes in ramond - ramond field or graviphoton background @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown that , in the supermatrix model , fluctuations on a fuzzy supersphere yield supersymmetric nc field theories @xcite .",
    "besides , some interesting relations between nac geometry , landau problem and qh systems are reported @xcite . especially , on a fuzzy supersphere , a supersymmetric extension of qh liquid",
    "was explicitly constructed in ref.@xcite .",
    "while mathematical properties of nac theories have been well investigated @xcite , their emergent physical consequences have not been satisfactorily understood yet .",
    "the supersymmetric qh system provides a rare `` physical '' set - up whose underlying mathematics is given by nac geometry .",
    "since two dimensional and higher dimensional qh systems manifest peculiar properties of nc geometry , it would be reasonable to expect that explorations of supersymmetric qh liquids may reveal yet unknown physical aspects of the nac geometry . in this paper , by taking a planar limit of the fuzzy supersphere , we construct qh liquids on a nc superplane , and investigate physical properties in a nac world .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ superncplane ] ,",
    "we review a systematic construction of nc superplane from the fuzzy supersphere .",
    "it is shown that the nc superplane is realized by introducing the super gauge fields . in section [ lagrangeformalism ]",
    ", we develop lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms for one - particle system on the nc superplane .",
    "the system possesses ( complex ) @xmath0 supersymmetry , one of which is dynamical and the other is non - dynamical .",
    "another approach for one - particle system on a nc plane with supersymmetry is found in ref.@xcite , where a higher derivative term is introduced to be invariant under the galilean boosts transformation . in section [ hilbertspace ] , we analyze a supersymmetric landau problem . in each of the higher landau levels ( lls )",
    ", there exists @xmath0 supersymmetry , while in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , only the @xmath1 non - dynamical supersymmetry remains valid .",
    "we explicitly construct radially symmetric orbit states , which form a `` complete '' basis in the lll .",
    "these states are super - holomorphic except for their exponential term , and show a super - chiral property where not only the orbital rotation but also the spin polarization is chiral . in section [ laughlinplane ] , a laughlin wavefunction and its superpartner on the nc superplane are derived . in section [ excitedplane ] , we present bosonic and fermionic topological excitations , and investigate their basic properties . in section [ realsystem ] , we discuss a possible mapping from supersymmetric qh systems to bilayer qh systems .",

    "hence , they should carry the same @xmath88 angular momentum , while their eigenvalues of the angular momentum @xmath41 are different .",
    "this discrepancy is solved by noticing that @xmath41 represents the @xmath89 angular momentum , and each of the four particle states carries the @xmath90 as well as the orbital angular momentum .",

    "intriguingly , @xmath111 has its superpartner @xmath113 unlike the laughlin - haldane wavefunction on the supersphere @xcite .",

    "since the hamiltonian for the supersymmetric landau problem ( [ hamilsecond ] ) is given by a sum of the bosonic oscillators and the fermionic oscillators , the whole supersymmetric hilbert space is simply constructed by a direct product of bosonic and fermionic hilbert spaces . in this section , with use of the symmetric gauge , we present explict forms of the basis in bosonic and fermionic landau problems .",
    "first , we concisely review the bosonic landau problem .",
    "the hamiltonian and the angular momentum are given by @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "the state in the bosonic hilbert space with energy @xmath188 and angular momentum @xmath84 is @xmath189 in particular , the hilbert space in lll ( @xmath190 ) is spanned by the basis @xmath191 when we adopt the symmetric gauge , the lll condition , @xmath192 , is denoted as @xmath193 hence , the wavefunction in lll is generally expressed as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is an arbitrary holomorphic function and any wavefunction in lll can be expanded by the radially symmetric orbits , @xmath196 they are the position representation of eq.([lllbasis1 ] ) and satisfy the orthonormal condition @xmath197 the `` complete relation '' in lll is calculated as @xmath198    the fermionic landau problem is similarly analyzed .",
    "the hamiltonian and the angular momentum are given by @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively .",
    "due to the pauli exclusion principle , the hilbert space for fermionic oscillators consists of only four states .",
    "there are only two energy levels , lll and 1-st ll , with energy @xmath201 , both of which are doubly degenerate .",
    "two states in the lll with angular momentum @xmath202 are given by @xmath203 where @xmath96 is defined as @xmath204 .",
    "two states in the 1-st ll with angular momentum @xmath205 are given by @xmath206 in the symmetric gauge , the lll condition , @xmath207 , is rewritten as @xmath208 hence , the wavefunction in fermionic lll is generally given by @xmath209 where @xmath210 is an arbitrary holomorphic function .",
    "therefore , any wavefunction in the lll of the fermionic oscillators can be expanded by the following states    @xmath211    in fact , these are the position representation of @xmath212 and @xmath213 . similarly the position representation of the 1-st ll states , @xmath214 and @xmath215 , are    @xmath216    they satisfy the orthonormal condition @xmath217 where we have included a weight factor and have defined the grassmann integral as @xmath218 . the complete relation for these states",
    "is obtained as @xmath219 where we have taken into account the weight factor as in eq.([fermiortho ] ) .",
    "the `` complete relation '' in the fermionic lll is calculated as @xmath220",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss von neumann basis formalism on the superplane . the von neumann basis is a convenient basis to investigate qh systems ,",
    "because it is a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical cyclotron orbit and , in a continuum limit , the translational symmetries are expected to be recovered @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the supercoherent state as a simultaneous eigenstate of two annihilation operators @xmath221 and @xmath222 , @xmath223 ( the annihilation operators are denoted with hat to distinguish their eigenvalues . )",
    "explicitly , the supercoherent state is given by @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are bosonic and fermionic coherent states given by @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "in the symmetric gauge , the supercoherent state is written as @xmath229 we define a super von neumann basis as a subset of the supercoherent states , whose index takes discrete values @xmath230 where @xmath126 and @xmath93 take integers .",
    "it is easily checked that the complete relation for the super von neumann basis exactly coincides with the `` complete relation '' in the lll ( [ completelll ] ) .",
    "thus , the super von neumann basis spans the hilbert space in the lll .",
