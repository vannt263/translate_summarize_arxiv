    "it is well admitted that pulsars are strongly magnetized and rotating neutron stars surrounded by electron - positron pairs filling their magnetosphere",
    ". however an accurate description of the interaction between this plasma and the neutron star electromagnetic field remains poorly constrained by observations .",
    "moreover a realistic model should also include some radiative processes .",
    "we are still far from a comprehensive and self - consistent picture of the pulsar machinery . both plasma flows and strong gravity impact on the structure of the magnetosphere . curvature and frame - dragging effects are indeed important due to the high compactness of neutron stars . for typical models of neutron star interiors ,",
    "the compactness is about @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath3 is the mass of the neutron star , @xmath4 its radius , @xmath5 the gravitational constant and @xmath6 the speed of light .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the response of the electromagnetic field to the combined effect of plasma screening and curved space - time in the vicinity of a neutron star . to this aim",
    "we compute general - relativistic solutions in the force - free approximation .",
    "the problem we therefore address is similar to the electrodynamics of black hole magnetospheres . actually , the numerical technique employed are the same expected that in our case we do not have any complication arising from the presence of an event horizon .",
    "@xcite was the first to report on numerical simulations of general - relativistic monopole magnetospheres of black holes in the magnetohydrodynamic regime .",
    "@xcite also investigated the properties of the magnetospheric plasma in the force - free limit .",
    "since then , several authors followed the effort of modelling general - relativistic magnetospheres of compact objects . @xcite",
    "designed a general - relativistic code for force - free magnetospheres and @xcite applied it also to neutron stars .",
    "@xcite showed that multipole vacuum solutions in general relativity",
    "can be computed semi - analytically via the 3 + 1  formalism through a vector spherical harmonic expansion method introduced by @xcite . however it is well known that a neutron star can not be surrounded by vacuum .",
    "indeed , the electric field induced by the rotation of the magnetic field generates huge lorentz forces able to extract particles from the crust and therefore filling the magnetosphere . for simplicity , as a first step towards more realistic magnetospheres ,",
    "the force - free assumption is often quoted . in that case",
    "the plasma dynamics is completely dominated by the electromagnetic field which is a good approximation for neutron star magnetospheres .",
    "the resulting force - free geometry has been investigated by many authors like for instance in the aligned case by @xcite and the general oblique rotator by .",
    "general - relativistic force - free neutron star magnetospheres have been less investigated so far .",
    "but @xcite already mentioned that general - relativistic effects can significantly distort the parallel component ( with respect to the magnetic field ) of the electric field .",
    "this can have important implications for particle creation , acceleration and radiation in the polar caps .",
    "indeed , deviation from the corotation charge density leads to a parallel component of the electric field determined by the magnetic field geometry .",
    "therefore , as also claimed by @xcite , space - time curvature and frame dragging effects are important for the electrodynamics of the gaps .",
    "several numerical techniques have been applied to model such magnetospheres .",
    "usually the schemes are closely related to the finite volume algorithm , a well tested method for computational fluid dynamics due to its conservative properties .",
    "high resolution shock capturing techniques enable an increase of the spatial order of the method but at the expense of larger stencils .",
    "such scheme are also useful to solve maxwell equations .",
    "recently , another arbitrary high order method , the discontinuous galerkin approach , has been tested in general relativity by @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to quantify precisely the distortion induced by general - relativistic effects , namely curvature of space - time and frame dragging . to this end",
    ", we solve the time - dependent maxwell equations in curved space - time in spherical coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , as a starting point we restrict the solutions to the monopole field in order to elucidate the consequences of general relativity avoiding complications induced for instance by the presence of a cusp at the light - cylinder in the case of an aligned dipolar magnetic field . strictly speaking , at this y - point , the magnetic field strength vanishes and",
    "can lead to problems in the force - free approximation due to the electric current density prescription .",
    "nevertheless , in order to show how efficiently the code can handle discontinuities such as current sheets for instance in the equatorial plane , we present newtonian as well as general - relativistic simulations of the split monopole field .",
    "consequently , we use the 3 + 1  formalism of electrodynamics as briefly reminded in section  [ sec : modele ] . next we give approximate solutions to the vacuum monopole field in section  [ sec : monopole ] which will be useful for benchmarking the code whose algorithm is described in section  [ sec : algorithme ] and then tested in flat space - time in section  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "application of our new code to vacuum and force - free curved space - time monopoles are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we extend our study to the split monopole case to demonstrate the ease of handling discontinuities .",
    "conclusions and ongoing work are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we briefly remind the set of maxwell equations in curved space - time following the 3 + 1  formalism for a fixed background metric .",
    "we split space - time into an absolute space  @xmath7 and a universal time  @xmath8 , similar to our all day experience .",
    "advantages of such a split have been demonstrated in many numerical simulations about neutron stars and black hole magnetospheres .",
    "the four dimensional space - time is split into a 3 + 1  foliation such that the background metric  @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath8 is the time coordinate or universal time and @xmath12 some associated space coordinates .",
    "the landau - lifschitz convention is used for the metric signature given by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is the lapse function , @xmath15 the shift vector and @xmath16 the spatial metric of absolute space . by convention",
    ", latin letters from @xmath17 to @xmath18 are used for the components of vectors in absolute space , in the range  @xmath19 , whereas latin letters starting from @xmath20 are used for four dimensional vectors and tensors , in the range  @xmath21 . a fiducial observer ( fido )",
    "is defined by its 4-velocity  @xmath22 such that    @xmath23    this vector is orthogonal to the hyper - surface of constant time coordinate  @xmath24 .",
    "its proper time  @xmath25 is measured according to @xmath26 for a slowly rotating neutron star , the lapse function is @xmath27 and the shift vector    @xmath28    we use a spherical coordinate system  @xmath29 and an orthonormal spatial basis  @xmath30 .",
    "the metric of a slowly rotating neutron star remains close to the usual flat space , except for the radial direction .",
    "indeed the components of the spatial metric are given in boyer - lindquist coordinates by @xmath31 for this slow rotation approximation , the spatial metric does not depend on the spin frequency of the massive body but only on @xmath3 through @xmath14 .",
    "the spin  @xmath17 is related to the angular momentum  @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 has units of a length and should satisfy @xmath34 . introducing the moment of inertia  @xmath35 , we also have @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the spin frequency . in the special case of a homogeneous and uniform neutron star interior with",
    "spherical symmetry , the moment of inertia reads @xmath38 thus the spin parameter can be expressed as @xmath39 for the remainder of this paper , we will use this expression to relate the spin parameter intervening in the metric to the spin frequency of the neutron star . from the above expression , note that the parameter  @xmath40 remains smaller than  0.4 because @xmath41 and @xmath42 in our set of simulations .",
    "maxwell equations in absolute space take a form very similar to their traditional expression in newtonian space except that space is curved .",
    "the time - dependent maxwell equations in a prescribed metric ( possibly time - dependent ) read    @xmath43    the source terms @xmath44 will be specified by the force - free condition , see paragraph below .",
    "the three dimensional vector fields are not independent , they are related by two important constitutive relations , namely    @xmath45    @xmath46 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath47 the vacuum permeability .",
    "the curvature of absolute space is taken into account by the lapse function factor  @xmath14 in the first term on the right - hand side and the frame dragging effect is included in the second term , the cross - product between the shift vector  @xmath48 and the fields .",
    "the derivation of the above equations is given in @xcite . from the auxiliary fields",
    "@xmath49 we get the poynting flux through a sphere of radius @xmath50 by computing the two dimensional integral on this sphere by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the infinitesimal solid angle and @xmath37 the full sky angle of  @xmath53  sr .      the source terms have not yet been specified .",
    "they are deduced from the force - free condition that in the 3 + 1  formalism become    @xmath54    which implies @xmath55 and therefore also @xmath56 . as in the special relativistic case",
    ", the current density is found to be , see the derivation for instance in @xcite @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be interpreted as the magnetic and electric field respectively as measured by the fido .",
    "moreover its electric current density  @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 maxwell equations  ( [ eq : maxwell1])-([eq : maxwell4 ] ) , the constitutive relations in equations  ( [ eq : constitutivee ] ) and ( [ eq : constitutiveh ] ) and the prescription for the source terms in equation  ( [ eq : courantffe ] ) set the background system to be solved for any prescribed metric in the force - free approximation .",
    "before dealing with the force - free solution , we recall the exact vacuum electromagnetic field in flat space - time and extend the result to the general - relativistic monopole field , valid up to first order in the spin parameter of the star . although the monopole assumption is not realistic for the zeroth order magnetic field of the neutron star , it gives us insight into the effects of curved space - time on to force - free magnetospheres .",
    "such solutions will also serve as benchmark for testing and checking current and forthcoming electromagnetic codes in general relativity .",
    "we start with a simple monopole magnetic field anchored in a perfectly conducting star of radius  @xmath4 and rotating at a speed  @xmath37 around an axis passing through its centre .",
    "let us denote this axis by @xmath62 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field at the surface is @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in minkowski space - time , the exterior vacuum solution for a rotating magnetic monopole is given by    @xmath64    assuming that the electric field in the comoving frame vanishes in the interior of the star .",
    "the induced electric field is therefore of dipolar nature .",
    "note that the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is simply @xmath67 . in terms of the `` potential '' , see equation  ( [ eq : potentield ] ) below , we can write it as @xmath68\\ ] ] this means that the only non - vanishing coefficient is @xmath69 all other coefficients of the expansion like @xmath70 and @xmath71 should be equal to zero .",

    "later , we will use this expression to check the numerical accuracy of our code , see section  [ sec : tests ] .      in order to look for the analytical solution to the general - relativistic monopole field in vacuum",
    ", we use the formalism developed in depth by @xcite .",
