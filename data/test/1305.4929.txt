    "slow - fast systems , i.e. nonlinear dynamical systems in which two or more processes are governed by very different time scales , appear in many branches of natural science @xcite . typically two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems undergo a supercritical hopf bifurcation in which the attractor changes from a stable equilibrium to stable relaxation oscillations .",
    "two kinds of oscillatory regimes can be readily identified , as paradigmatically illustrated by the fitzhugh - nagumo equations @xcite . in a narrow parameter range beyond the hopf bifurcation ,",
    "a small - amplitude quasi - harmonic limit cycle arises ( subthreshold oscillations ) , with frequency given by the imaginary part of the linear eigenvalues of the fixed point . out of this range , the amplitude of the limit cycle abruptly though continuously change to that of the relaxation oscillations regime , with a frequency depending on the splitting between the time scales . here",
    ", the dynamics can be decomposed into a sequence of periods of slow motion , taking place near the attracting branches of the slow - manifold ( equilibria of the fast subsystem ) @xcite , separated by faster relaxation jumps between them .",
    "the transition from the quasi - harmonic to the relaxational regime , referred to as canard explosion @xcite , occurs within an exponentially small range of a control parameter , in which the system trajectories closely follow for some time also the repelling part of the slow manifold .    in high - dimensional phase spaces ,",
    "canard explosions give rise to more complex scenarios @xcite . while 2d systems display subthreshold or relaxation oscillations but never both of them for a fixed set of parameters , in higher dimensions a clear separation of the two regimes is usually lost .",
    "this is the case of mixed - mode oscillations @xcite , consisting of an alternation of relaxation excursions and ( small - amplitude ) quasi - harmonic oscillations .",
    "these regimes can be periodic or chaotic , in which case relaxation spikes are separated by an irregular number of subthreshold oscillations ( chaotic spiking ) .",
    "similar spiking sequences have been observed in a semiconductor laser with optoelectronic feedback @xcite and , recently , in a high - finesse suspended - mirror optical cavity @xcite .    in the latter ,",
    "the intracavity field and the mirror motion are coupled through radiation pressure and photothermal effect ( the latter indicating the thermal expansion of the mirrors due to the absorbed intracavity light ) . since such processes , as well as the intracavity field itself , are competing and are governed by very distinct time - scales , optomechanical resonators possess all the typical features of slow - fast dynamical systems .",
    "previous experiments in optomechanical resonators have shown that periodic and chaotic oscillations can be induced by either radiation - pressure @xcite or photothermal nonlinearities @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "regenerative oscillations arise thanks to the delay of the electric field buildup in the cavity or due to the spatio - temporal profiles of the coupled elastic and temperature fields @xcite .",
    "recently , also the interplay between radiation - pressure and changes to mechanical frequency due to absorption heating has been considered @xcite .",
    "however , the regime in which both radiation pressure and photothermal effects are relevant has been poorly explored so far .",
    "the occurrence of irregular spike sequences induced by these effects has been theoretically predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in a regime where the mirror motion was overdamped and the field adiabatically eliminated . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provided experimental evidence of these phenomena , although in a completely different regime of parameters . however , important features of the chaotic spiking regime , in particular its relation to canard explosions in a high - dimensional phase - space , were not exhaustively analyzed .    here",
    "we extend and generalize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , unveiling the effects of the multiple timescale competition between photothermal and radiation pressure nonlinearities in an optomechanical resonator .",
    "in particular , we show that chaotic spiking sequences are the result of canard explosions in a higher - dimensional phase space , in which trajectories are rapidly attracted towards the stable branches of a one - dimensional * s*-shaped manifold , where the slow dynamics takes place .",
    "we also show that this regime coexists with other non - trivial attractors , on which the trajectories evolve on a substantially faster time - scale . therefore",
    ", which attractor is eventually reached by the system depends only on the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "finally , the experimental results are reproduced by means of a detailed physical model , which allows us to identify the mechanims underlying the observed dynamics .",
    "since the stable operation of optomechanical resonators is a fundamental requirement in many quantum optics experiments @xcite , a complete characterization of the system attractors is mandatory , in order to identify the instability boundaries as well as to design suitable control schemes .",

    "the radiation intensity is controlled by an half - wave plate followed by a polarizing beam splitter and the reflected signal beam is monitored by the photodiode pd . the laser frequency can be continuously tuned within a range of 6 ghz by changing the temperature of the monolithic laser crystal through an offset voltage .",
    "fast frequency scanning is achieved by applying a ramp voltage signal to a pzt on the laser crystal .",
    "in an optomechanical resonator , the intracavity field and the cavity length variations are nonlinearly coupled through radiation pressure and photothermal effects .",
    "a physical model of an optomechanical resonator in the presence of these two effects has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently analyzed in ref @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure , pushing the mirrors , tends to increase the cavity length with respect to its cold - cavity value ( i.e. in absence of radiation pressure and photothermal effects ) .",
    "therefore , by injecting a monochromatic beam detuned on the long wavelength side with respect to the cold - cavity resonance , the cavity resonance moves towards the injected wavelength and therefore the intracavity intensity increases .",
    "the intracavity field has the further effect of varying the temperature of the mirrors .",
    "heating induces a decrease of the cavity length through the mirror thermal expansion , and it moves away the cavity resonance thereby decreasing the intracavity intensity .",
    "it is worth to notice that radiation - pressure acts on a fast timescale , given by @xmath18 ( about 4 @xmath0s in our resonator ) , while the photothermal effect on the much slower @xmath19ms , where @xmath20 is the photothermal response angular frequency @xcite .",
    "the structure and the stability of the slow manifold is analogous to that of the fitzhugh - nagumo equations , thus giving rise to excitability and canard - orbits @xcite .",
    "a radically new scenario for the transition from excitability to relaxation oscillations is observed when the mirror motion is not overdamped , i.e. when the damping rate @xmath21 becomes sufficiently smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "now the fast motion includes inertial terms , therefore occurring on a two - dimensional fast manifold and the whole dynamics is governed by a 3d slow - fast system .",
    "the initial hopf bifurcation is followed by a cascade of period doubling bifurcations producing a sequence of small periodic and chaotic attractors , that develops before relaxation oscillations arise .",
    "as the mean amplitude of the chaotic attractors grows , a canard regime sets in , where the small chaotic background spontaneously triggers excitable spikes in an erratic but deterministic sequence .",
    "such a regime has been theoretically studied in ref .",
    "however , at difference with the model analyzed there , in the system explored in this work the optical field evolves on a timescale comparable to that of radiation pressure and can not be adiabatically eliminated .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) realistically describes the photothermal dynamics only at frequencies well above @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the frequency response of the length variations to a modulated intracavity power has a slow , logarithmic divergence at low frequencies  @xcite , while it follows an intuitive 1/frequency - dependence as in a standard single - pole system at high frequencies .",
    "the photothermal response is dominated by the fused silica input mirror for which we calculate @xmath37  50  hz , leading to @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , given an absorption of 2 ppm .",
    "we first characterize the stable and unstable regions of the system , as both the laser frequency and injected power , @xmath11 , are varied .",
    "since the laser is not frequency - locked , the noise present in the system prevents the point - by point construction of a bifurcation diagram .",
    "however , information about the instability domains can be roughly extracted from the system response to a slow modulation of the laser frequency , by keeping fixed the injected power . in fig .",

    "we have completed the analysis of the slow - fast dynamics , first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that chaotic spiking sequences are the result of canard explosions in a higher - dimensional phase space , in which trajectories are rapidly attracted towards the stable branches of a one - dimensional * s*-shaped manifold .",
    "the dynamics here described , as well as the structure and the stability of the slow manifold , are fully compatible with those numerically observed in a 3d slow - fast system governed by one slow and two fast variables @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have shown that this regime coexists with other non - trivial periodic solutions , whose characteristic time - scales are substantially faster .",
    "in particular , the steady resonant condition , i.e. the operation region required in quantum optics experiments , coexists with a limit cycle solution .",
    "therefore , our results find immediate applications in the field of optomechanical experiments , in order to design control schemes able to mantain the system close enough to the resonant steady state .",
    "the recent progresses in the photonic crystal engineering have opened the prospect to build arrays of many coupled optomechanical oscillators integrated on a chip . even in the classical regime",
    ", one could thus be able to explore the collective dynamics of arrays consisting of many coupled optomechanical cells .",
    "in the presence of field dynamics and radiation pressure it has been theoretically shown that optomechanical arrays can display synchronization , and that they can be described by an effective kuramoto - type model @xcite . in this framework , the dynamics we observe is even more interesting , since it involves the generation of irregular ( deterministic ) spike sequences , which are known to play an important role in neural information processing .",
    "therefore , the possibility to study synchronization phenomena between chaotically spiking units could be of interest in different fields ranging from physics to dynamical system theory and neuroscience .",
