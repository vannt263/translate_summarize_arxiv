    "the study of random combinatorial objects is an amazing success story , which grew from ad hoc problems and simple ideas to a flourishing field of its own , with many astonishing results , advanced tools and important applications ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . since the early work of erds and collaborators",
    ", it has long been known that the `` typical '' objects often have an interesting and unexpected structure often worth exploring .",
    "some such random combinatorial objects such as various classes of random graphs are understood to a remarkable degree ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , while others , such as random finite groups remain largely mysterious ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . _",
    "random integer partitions _ occupy the middle ground , with a large mix of known results and open problems ( cf .",
    "section  [ final : remarks ] ) , and are a subject of this paper .",
    "_ partition theory _ is a classical subject introduced by euler nearly three hundred years ago , which has strong connections and applications to a variety of areas ranging from number theory to special functions , from group representation theory to probability and statistical physics .",
    "a _ partition _ of  @xmath0 is an integer sequence @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "much of this paper is concerned with asymptotic analysis of various classes of partitions , some known and some new .",
    "let us begin by noting that already the number @xmath4 of integer partitions of  @xmath0 is a notoriously difficult sequence ; it is not even known if it is equidistributed modulo  @xmath5 .",
    "there are several specialized tools , however , which allow a detailed information about random partitions .",
    "first , the analytic tools by hardy  ramanujan and rademacher give a precise asymptotics of  @xmath4 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "second , the _ boltzmann sampling _ , in this case invented earlier by fristedt  @xcite , allows a uniform sampling of random partitions of  @xmath0 with a high degree of independence between part sizes .",
    "this paper introduces a new combinatorial tool , which is best used in conjunction with these",
    ".    our main emphasis will be not on enumeration of various classes of partitions , but on the limit shapes of random such partitions .",
    "it is a well known phenomenon that random combinatorial objects , e.g.  random graphs , tend to have unusually interesting parameters , of interest in both theory and applications . when represented geometrically ,",
    "these random objects illuminate the underlying 0/1 laws of their asymptotic behavior ; examples included various _ arctic circle _ shapes for domino tilings and perfect matchings ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and for alternating sign matrices ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that there are many different notions of the _ limit shape _ , which differ depending on the context and the geometric representation .",
    "first , one needs to be careful in the choice of the _ scaling _ , by which combinatorial objects of different sizes are compared to each other . in this paper",
    "we use different scaling for different classes of partitions .",
    "second , there is more than one notion of convergence to the limit shape , some stronger than others . roughly speaking ,",
    "they describe how close are the random objects to the limit shape . here",
    "we work with two different notions , convergence in expectation , which we refer to as the _ weak notion of the limit shape _ , and convergence in probability , which we refer to as the _ strong notion of the limit shape _ , which is implied by a stronger large deviation result as well as a local central limit theorem ( see below ) .",
    "as we mentioned earlier the main result of the paper is the computation of limit shapes for several well known classes ( _ ensembles _ ) of random partitions for which this was neither known nor even conjectured before .",
    "most our results are not obtainable by previously known techniques .",
    "we postpone the precise formulation of our results until the next subsection ; for now let us briefly survey the long history of ideas leading to this work .",
    "arguably , partition theory began with euler s work establishing equality for the number of partitions in different classes by means of algebraic manipulation of generating functions .",
    "the next crucial step was made by sylvester and his students which introduced _ partition bijections _ and used them to prove many results by euler and others .",
    "roughly speaking , a partition is represented as a _ young diagram _ and the squares are rearranged accordingly .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a detailed survey of this approach .",
    "the study of the number @xmath6 of partitions of @xmath0 with at most @xmath7 parts goes back to cayley , sylvester and macmahon .",
    "hardy and ramanujan obtained a remarkable asymptotic formula , further refined by others",
    ". the first result on limit shapes is the _ erds  szekeres theorem _ , which can be formulated as follows : @xmath8 \\. = \\.",
    "\\beta \\sqrt{n}\\ts \\bigl(1+o(1)\\bigr ) , \\quad \\text{where } \\ \\ e^{-\\alpha c } + e^{-\\beta c } \\.= \\.1 \\ \\ \\ , \\text{and } \\ \\ c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{6}}\\ .. \\ ] ] these results were strengthened and extended in a number of papers , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there are two prominent types of partition classes considered in the literature , which are essentially conjugate to each other .",
    "the classes are defined by restrictions on parts  @xmath9 , and those with restriction on the number of times @xmath10 part @xmath11 appear in the partition , with no restrictions relating parts to each other .",
    "for example , the set of partitions into odd numbers fits into the latter class , which corresponds to a restriction of the form @xmath12 for all @xmath11 even .",
    "sometimes this is less obvious , for example , for partitions into distinct parts , the restriction is that each part appears at most once , i.e. , @xmath13 , rather than the fact that they are distinct , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "there is an extensive body of research related to limit shapes of integer partitions for which the restrictions are solely placed on the multiplicities @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we consider restrictions on part sizes , such as the _ convex partitions _ , which satisfy @xmath15 these are equinumerous with partitions into triangular parts @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath12 whenever @xmath11 is not a triangular number , which have a well understood limit shape .",
    "the bijection between these two classes of partitions is also well known  @xcite , and we demonstrate how to obtain one limit shape from the other .",
    "the idea of this paper is to use partition bijections to transfer the limit shape results from one class of partitions onto another .",
    "making this formal is rather subtle . in  @xcite",
    ", the second author introduces a necessary formalism essentially allowing such transfer , with the aim of proving that there is no natural proof of the classical _ rogers ",
    "ramanujan identities_. this paper continues this approach , but can be read independently of  @xcite and other earlier work .",
    "@xmath17    to understand the notion of the limit shape , we start with a geometric interpretation of an integer partition .",
    "each integer partition can be visualized as a curve in the first quadrant of @xmath18 , with a height function determined by the part sizes ; see figure  [ young : diagram ] . by simultaneously plotting all of the young diagrams of every integer partition of a very large fixed size  @xmath0 ,",
    "for each @xmath0 one observes empirically a curve which is close to most of the diagram functions , namely , @xmath19 normalizing the @xmath20- and @xmath21-axes by @xmath22 , a single curve emerges in the limit as @xmath23 .",
    "this curve is a law of large numbers for the joint distribution of part sizes in a random integer partition .",
    "our definition of a limit shape , made precise in  [ diagram functions ] , is a limit _ in probability _ as @xmath23 , of appropriately scaled part sizes of a uniformly random integer partition of size  @xmath0 .",
    "the main technique for finding and proving the form of the limit shape is via a probabilistic model .",
    "the joint distribution of part sizes in a random integer partition of size  @xmath0 is approximated by a certain joint distribution of _ independent _ random variables , which produces a random integer partition of random size .",
    "a weak notion of a limit shape is the convergence in expectation of the joint distribution of the independent random variables .",
    "it is easy to calculate the limit shape in this setting , as the calculation simplifies to a riemann sum .",
    "we show in section  [ sect prob ] that the weak notion of a limit shape agrees with the usual limit shape in the context of integer partitions .",
    "this is also known as the _ equivalence of ensembles_.    we start with two pivotal results in the field of limit shapes of integer partitions : the classical limit shape , and the limit shape of partitions into distinct parts .",
    "there is a long and rather involved history involving limit shapes , which is confounded by the weak and strong notions of limit shapes ; see  [ history ] for a more detailed account .",
    "we denote the limit shape of unrestricted integer partitions by @xmath24 .",
    "[ unrestricted : limit : shape ] let @xmath25 denote the limit shape of integer partitions . then : @xmath26    a similar result is true for the limit shape of integer partitions into distinct parts , which we denote by  @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the limit shape of integer partitions into distinct parts .",
    "then : @xmath29    one can also place certain types of restrictions on the part sizes in an integer partition , and ask whether or not a limit shape exists .",
    "we assume the part sizes are restricted to a set @xmath30 , where @xmath31 for some @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( subject to other technical assumptions , see   [ credit ] ) .",
    "then , analogously as before , most partitions of size  @xmath0 are close to a certain curve , which satisfies @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a constant which makes the area under the curve equal to one . in this case , the scaling of the @xmath20-axis is by @xmath36 and the scaling of the @xmath21-axis is by @xmath37 .    [",
    "rb : theorem ] let @xmath38 denote the limit shape of integer partitions with part sizes restricted to @xmath39 , with @xmath31 for some @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "denote by @xmath40 the derivative of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "then : @xmath41 where @xmath35 is given by equation  .",
    "a similar generalization holds for partitions into distinct parts from a set @xmath39  .",
    "an alternative parameterization is by andrews  @xcite , who defined the restrictions on part sizes of an integer partition by a sequence @xmath42 , where the multiplicity of the parts of size@xmath43 is restricted to be strictly less than @xmath44 .",
    "for example , the set of unrestricted partitions corresponds to the sequence @xmath45 , and partitions into distinct parts corresponds to @xmath46 . when parts sizes are restricted to @xmath39 .",
    ", this corresponds to the sequence @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "there are , however , certain restrictions on integer partitions for which a limit shape does not exist . for example , if we consider the sequence @xmath51 , @xmath48 , and @xmath52 if @xmath53 is not a power of 2 , then there is exactly one integer partition for each @xmath0 ; namely , the base-2 representation of the number @xmath0 .",
    "for another example , let @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for @xmath57 for some positive @xmath58 .",
    "this sequence corresponds to partitions of @xmath0 with largest part at most @xmath58 . for @xmath58",
    "fixed , the number of such partitions only grows polynomially with @xmath0 , and there is no limit shape .",
    "in contrast , the case @xmath59 was handled by romik  @xcite , as well as vershik and yakubovich  @xcite , and the limit shape does indeed exist .",
    "there are other classes of partitions which can not be described by andrews s parameterization .",
    "in particular , for the example of convex partitions described above , it is not immediately clear whether or not a limit shape exists , or if it does , what is the proper scaling .",
    "nevertheless , we show in   [ convex ] that indeed the limit shape of convex partitions exists and demonstrate how to compute it .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain new limit shapes for integer partitions with restrictions which do not fit into the usual framework described above .",
    "the form of the restrictions given by andrews is a subset of restrictions called _ multiplicative restrictions _ by vershik  @xcite , owing to the form of the generating function as a product of terms ; it also refers to the fact that under the weak form of the limit shape , part sizes are treated as independent , and so probabilities factor according to part sizes .",
    "our first example is an application of the various geometric transformations defined in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the set of partitions @xmath61 with consecutive parts @xmath62 for even part sizes @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for all odd part sizes @xmath63 , @xmath65 let @xmath66 denote the limit shape of  @xmath60 , and let @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",

    "moreover , once we have the limit shape , certain statistics immediately follow .    [",

    "the durfee square of a partition @xmath76 is the number of @xmath77 such that @xmath78 .",

    "it is thus natural to ask if it is possible to obtain the limit shape of @xmath93 from the limit shape of @xmath90 .",
    "the answer is affirmative , as witnessed in section  [ sect r ] , _ due to the form of the bijection_. in fact , corollary  [ convex : corollary ] below is a special case of a much larger class of partition bijections which map limit shapes continuously , which we describe in  [ transfer : theorems ] .",

    "the reason why the weaker notion of the limit shape , i.e. , convergence in expectation of random - size partitions with independent part sizes , coincides with the strong notion of the limit shape , i.e. , convergence in probability of integer partitions of a fixed size , is due to the exponential concentration of the limit shape statistic .",

    "in  [ romik : example ] we have @xmath923 .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate conditions on @xmath921 and @xmath235 such that the limit shape exists .",
    "our approach does not extend to compute the limit shape for classes of partitions for which no bijection to andrews class partitions is known .",
    "one notable example is the partitions into powers of  @xmath5 , which are equinumerous with certain _ cayley compositions _ ( see  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* http://oeis.org/a000123[a000123 ] ) ) .",
    "in this case the usual notion of a limit shape does not exist and an alternative notion is required .",
    "fristedt s method  @xcite in section  [ sect prob ] defines a random sampling algorithm for andrews class partitions of a fixed size  @xmath0 .",
    "namely , we sample independent geometric random variables @xmath924 , where @xmath873 has parameter @xmath168 , @xmath703 , @xmath48 , and check whether @xmath925 , repeating the sampling of @xmath924 until the condition is satisfied .",
    "the expected number of times that we resample is given by @xmath926 , where @xmath927    an application of probabilistic divide - and - conquer ( pdc ) , introduced in  @xcite , see also  @xcite , uses von neumann s rejection sampling  @xcite to obtain a speedup .",
    "the algorithm is to sample repeatedly from @xmath928 and @xmath235 , uniform on @xmath610 , until @xmath929 the expected number of times that we resample this procedure is @xmath930 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) , a considerable speedup .    more generally , consider the set of partitions with parts in the set @xmath235 , where @xmath931 . the pdc deterministic second half algorithm to generate a random integer partition of size  @xmath0 with parts in the set @xmath235 is to sample repeatedly rom @xmath932 and @xmath235 , uniform on @xmath610 , until @xmath933 the speedup in this case is given by @xmath934 hence , the expected number of rejections before a single accepted sample via the pdc deterministic second half algorithm is asymptotically @xmath935 .",
    "there are also bijections defined as linear transformations by corteel and savage  @xcite , and corteel , savage , and wilf  @xcite , which correspond to partitions which satisfy various inequality conditions on the part sizes , in a sense generalizing the set @xmath936 of partitions with nonnegative @xmath397 differences in section  [ sect r ] .",
    "a further generalization was demonstrated by pak  @xcite ; most of those examples involve sets @xmath235 where @xmath243 grows exponentially in @xmath58 , and so our theorems do not apply .    of particular note",
    "is that our linear transformations are only assumed to act as markov operators on the diagram function , so it is not necessary that the coefficients of the matrix transformation @xmath332 each be nonnegative ; matrix @xmath332 simply needs to map positive coordinates to positive coordinates .      for self - conjugate partitions , it would be interesting to define a coupling over the set of random variables governing the part sizes , although this has many apparent difficulties .",
    "we hope to return to this problem in the future .",
    "we showed earlier in remark  [ vanishing : mass ] that the limit shape of @xmath268 under scaling function @xmath22 does not exist , since the scaled diagram function converges to @xmath939 for @xmath940 , which does not have unit area .",
    "the limit shape of @xmath357 exists and is equal to @xmath941 for @xmath942 .",
    "consider the ( non - bijective ) transformation @xmath943 , which sends partitions in @xmath268 to @xmath357 . even though there is a transformation , and each set of partitions tends to some limiting curve , there is no connection implied about the limit curves since the transformation is not even a bijection .",
