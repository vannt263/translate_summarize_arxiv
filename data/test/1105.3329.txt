    "recent progress in the description of integrable partial difference equations is to a great part due to the consistency approach @xcite , in particular in the form of 3 dimensional consistency - around - a - cube ( cac ) .",
    "one of the highlights of this approach is the immediate existence of a lax pair and bcklund transforms ( bt ) , which can be directly constructed from the `` side - equations '' of the cube @xcite .",
    "one can say , in effect , that the set of side equations yields the bt and the lax pair .",
    "one situation where side equations have been used effectively is in constructing soliton solutions to the lattice equations @xcite .",
    "originally it was assumed that on all faces of the cube the equations were the same in form , depending on the relevant corner variables ( one component at each corner ) and spectral parameters .",
    "recently , 3d consistent sets have appeared , with different equations on the faces @xcite . in this more general context",
    "it is of interest to take a closer look at the lax pairs , bcklund transforms and consistency , and investigate what they are good for .",
    "it should be noted that in the context of partial differential equations the existence of trivial lax pairs is well known @xcite and similar examples have also been noted for some discrete equations ( see @xcite , chapt .",
    "we will first recall how consistency around the cube , existence of lax pairs and bcklund transformations are intimately related for lattice maps on the square lattice given by multi - affine relations ( sections [ sec-3d - reminder ] and [ sec - lax - bt ] ) .",
    "these considerations apply to the elementary cells , and are _",
    "local_. in section [ sec - examples ] , we describe specific examples having the cac property .",
    "we detail in particular the already known explicit forms of the equations and lax pairs which we use in the rest of this paper . in particular",
    ", we find that in some cases the zero curvature condition ( zcc ) yields two different equations that can be used to define rational evolution in the lattice .",
    "we then address the _ global _ problem of defining equations over the whole lattice , with the guideline given by the 3 dimensional structure coming from the cac construction ( section [ secalge ] ) , and check integrability with the calculation of algebraic entropy . in section [ sec-2x2 ] ,",
    "we push the use of @xmath0-matrix lax pairs to its limits , by constructing discrete systems over a larger sub - lattice of the original lattice .",
    "this brings to the light interesting ( integrable ) structures related to a generalized form of the functional yang - baxter equations  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a regular 2d square lattice , with vertices labeled by integers @xmath1 .",
    "functions @xmath2 are associated to the vertices , and they are subject to a constraint at all elementary cells .",
    "this constraint is expressed by an equation @xmath3 , assumed to be multi - affine in the four vertex variables .",
    "it should depend on all 4 vertex variables , and it should not factorize . it may also depend on some parameters .",
    "sometimes the parameters can be associated to specific directions of the lattice , in which case they appear as `` spectral parameters '' . to ease the notation ,",
    "one usually denotes the running value @xmath2 by @xmath4 , and for neighboring values one only indicates the shifts : @xmath5 , or in 3d setting , @xmath6 etc .    for multidimensional consistency",

    "the lax matrices provide parallel transport of @xmath25 along the bonds of the lattice .",
    "the zero curvature condition means that the parallel transport along any closed path on the lattice is trivial .",
    "it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that taking @xmath25 from position @xmath33 to @xmath34 via the two routes @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives the same result : @xmath37 this matrix relation yields three scalar equations .",
    "these equations are written in terms of the variables @xmath38 , and in order to satisfy the zcc we must impose a constraint on these variables . in standard cases , this constraint will just be the bottom equation .",
    "indeed , in integrable cases the three equations in have a common factor .",
    "it may also happen that the zcc is satisfied automatically , if the side equations are simple enough , or sometimes the common factor may factorize , yielding multiple choices .",
    "we will examine specific examples of this phenomenon below .",

    "2 .   solve @xmath9 from the back equation .",
    "3 .   solve @xmath12 from the front equation .",

    "one can find the following explicit forms for the @xmath46 : @xmath47    that the lax and the bt approaches yield the same equations can be seen as follows : let us denote @xmath48 , then the matrix elements of @xmath49 are related to @xmath46 as follows ( here subscripts indicate the matrix element ) : @xmath50 thus @xmath51 iff @xmath52 .",
    "of course one can equally well use the side equations to solve for the variables @xmath53 from the left- , back- , and front - equations , after which the right - equation will be a polynomial in @xmath54 with coefficient depending on @xmath18 , with their gcd yielding the top equation .",
    "as a first example we consider the case where all the side equations are linear , i.e. , the left side equation is : @xmath55 and we have the same equation with suitable subscript changes on the other vertical sides .",

    "this of course is in the form of a conservation law .",
    "so far we have only considered a single cube and its cac / lax / bt . but as the name indicates , lattice equations should be defined over the whole lattice .",
    "this brings further complications , for example with one cube we could freely do different mbius transformations in each corner of a cube , but when the cube is part of lattice such seemingly innocuous actions will affect neighboring cubes as well and can destroy the lattice structure .",

    "this is expected to produce integrable lattice equations .",
    "we will follow this guideline for various models mentioned before , and systematically check integrability of the lattice equations so obtained , by calculating their algebraic entropy  @xcite : the vanishing of the entropy is a yes / no test which gives a clear cut separation between integrable and non integrable cases .",
    "we may briefly recall how to calculate the entropy .",
    "the local equation determines an evolution , starting from initial conditions given for example on a diagonal staircase ( lattice points of coordinates @xmath95 with @xmath96 or @xmath97 ) .",

    "the algebraic entropy is defined as the rate of growth of the degrees on these diagonals .",
    "exponential growth is generic , and polynomial growth is characteristic of integrability , while linear growth is associated with linearizable equations  @xcite .    the exact shape of the diagonal line on which the initial values are given is not important .",
    "if one modifies this shape locally , the sequence of degrees will change , but not its asymptotic rate of growth .",
    "this should be kept in mind for some of the models studied below .",
    "for example one could very well change the initial diagonal ( steps of height 1 and width 1 ) to a diagonal with bigger steps , for example with height 2 and width 2 , as this will not affect the calculation of the entropy .",
    "we can check the integrability of the two quad equations given in section ( [ linear - sides ] ) .",
    "the first one , i.e. , equation ( [ q1-lin ] ) , leads to the sequence of degrees : @xmath98 that is to say @xmath99 .",
    "this quadratic growth confirms integrability .    * remark * : since it is integrable , it should also be consistent with a nontrivial set of side - equations , such that one can produce it via lax / bt computations , but we will leave this open .    for the second equation of section ( [ linear - sides ] )",
    ", that is to say the general homogeneous relation ( [ quad - lin ] ) of degree @xmath58 , the result is different .",
    "we get the following sequence of degrees : @xmath100 which may be fitted with the generating function @xmath101 indicating a non vanishing entropy @xmath102 , showing non - integrability .",
    "thus even cac is not sharp in this case .",
    "it was actually shown in  @xcite that the simple additional condition @xmath103 , renders ( [ lin - side2 ] ) integrable .",
    "we have already noted that in the h1@xmath104 model there are two different cubes related by inversion , and that these cubes can be glued together in a unique way , providing a black - white lattice .",
    "this problem has been discussed in detail in @xcite .    since the gluing process is completely fixed and each cube has the cac property it is expected that the composite lattice is integrable .",
    "we have calculated the sequence of degrees @xmath105 for the evolution defined by this model , with initial conditions on a diagonal as prescribed above .",
    "the outcome is the sequence @xmath106 fitted by the generating function @xmath107 the above sequence has quadratic growth .",
    "thus the entropy is vanishing and the model is integrable .      in the flipped h1@xmath104 case ( sec .",
    "[ fh1e ] ) , the side equations are the same , allowing simple gluing together of the cubes , but , as we saw in section ( [ fh1e ] ) , the side - equations are somewhat weak and allow two different compatible pairs of bottom / top equations .",
    "we may then cover the two dimensional lattice with consistent cubes , assigning either equation bottom1 ( top1 ) , which we call _ white _ , or equation bottom2(top2 ) which we call _ black _ to each elementary cell .",
    "this can be done in an arbitrary way if one just insists on having a compatible 3d structure of cubes over the 2d lattice .",
