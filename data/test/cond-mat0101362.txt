    "the prediction of the strength of the electrorheological ( er ) effect is the main concern in the theoretical investigation of er fluids [ 15 ] .",
    "an er fluid is a suspension of particles with high dielectric constant ( conductivity ) in a host medium of low dielectric constant ( conductivity ) .",
    "the er effect originates from the induced interaction between the polarized particles in an er fluid . upon the application of an external electric field ,",
    "polarization charges are induced on the particle surfaces , leading to anisotropic forces between the particles . under the influence of the er effect",
    ", the particles in an er fluid initially aggregate rapidly into chains within milliseconds and then the chains aggregate into columns within seconds [ 3,4 ] .",
    "the rapid field - induced transition between the fluid and solid phase makes this material both important for wide industrial applications such as shock absorbers , dampers and clutches , as well as for experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "in deriving the induced forces between the particles , existing theories assume that the particles are at rest [ 610 ] . in a realistic situation , the fluid flow exerts force and torque on the particles , setting the particles in both translational and rotational motions .",
    "for instance , the shear flow in an er suspension exerts a toque on the particles , which leads to the rotation of particles about their centers [ 11 ] .",
    "recent experiments showed that the induced forces between the rotating particles are markedly different from the values predicted by the existing theories which have not taken the motion of particles into account [ 12 ] .",
    "wang designed a delicate experiment , in which a spherical particle is held fixed and the other one rotates uniformly , to investigate the dynamic er effects @xcite .",
    "the experimental result is that the force exerted on the rotating particle is smaller than that on the same particle at rest . in order to explain this effect , we formulate a model , which describes the relaxation process of the polarized charge on the surfaces of the rotating particles .",
    "we will compute the force between the polarized particles by the multiple image method @xcite .",
    "we will show that the induced force is inversely proportional to the square of the product of the relaxation time and the angular velocity of the rotating particle .",
    "in this section , we consider two spherical particles , one of which is held fixed , and the other one rotates around the axis perpendicular to the line joining the particles centers ( fig.[angular - dependent ] ) .",
    "both particles are dielectric spheres of dielectric constant @xmath0 , suspended in a host medium of dielectric constant @xmath1 . the rotating ( fixed ) sphere has a radius @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . in this section",
    ", we neglect the mutual polarization between the particles .",
    "this assumption is valid if the distance between the particles is large . upon the application of an electric field ,",
    "polarization charges are induced on the surface of the spheres and there are induced dipole moments .",
    "suppose the applied field is given by @xmath4=@xmath5 , the induced dipole moment is given by @xmath6=@xmath7 , where @xmath8and a similar expression for the fixed sphere .",
    "in the presence of a rotational motion , a displacement of polarization charge occurs on the particle surface .",
    "suppose the sphere is undergoing an anti - clockwise rotation with an angular velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the induced dipole moment will rotate with the same angular velocity , and the rate of change of the induced dipole moment is given by : @xmath10however , the induced dipole moment can relax back to its original orientation ( along @xmath4 ) and magnitude . if the relaxation process is characterized by a relaxation time @xmath11 ,",
    "we have : @xmath12when a steady state is reached , we have : @xmath13solving for the above equation , we obtain : @xmath14the result of eq.([rotating - dipole ] ) has a simple geometric interpretation .",
    "it can be shown that the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath15 is equal to @xmath16 and the magnitude of @xmath15 is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath16 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "in this section , we generalize the multiple image method @xcite to calculate the force between the polarized spheres , when the induced dipole moments are not parallel . consider two dielectric spheres , the radii of which are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively and the separation between their center is @xmath19 .",
    "suppose both the spheres are polarized with induced dipole moments @xmath6 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "due to mutual polarization effect , the dipole moment of each sphere will induce an image dipole on the other sphere .",
    "the induced image dipole will further induce another image dipole on the original sphere and hence multiple images are formed @xcite . to express the image dipole moment ,",
    "it is convenient to separate the original dipole moments into @xmath21 ( perpendicular to @xmath4 ) and @xmath22 components ( parallel to @xmath4 ) : @xmath23the total dipole moments are given by : @xmath24the @xmath21-components can be found by using the multiple image method @xcite : @xmath25 , \\label{pax}\\\\   p_{bx } & = & \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left [   { p_{b0x}(a \\sinh \\alpha)^3 ( -\\tau)^{2n-2 } \\over ( a \\sinh n\\alpha + b   \\sinh ( n-1)\\alpha)^3 }    + { p_{a0x}(b \\sinh \\alpha)^3 ( -\\tau)^{2n-1 } \\over ( r \\sinh n\\alpha)^3 }     \\right ] .",

    "\\label{pbz } \\end{aligned}\\]]the factor @xmath27 and @xmath28 apply to the transverse and longitudinal image dipole moments respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath29 is known as the dielectric contrast and is given by : @xmath30the parameter @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32we should remark that the present generalization is an approximation only , because there is a more complicated image method for a dielectric sphere @xcite .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath33 , the above expressions reduce to the results of perfectly conducting spheres .",
    "we expect that this approximation will be good at high contrast ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have checked the validity of the approximation by comparing the above analytic expressions with the numerical solution of an integral equation method @xcite .",
    "the force between the spheres is given by the following expression , based on the energy considerations @xcite : @xmath34 = f_r\\hat{r}+f_\\theta\\hat{\\theta}.\\]]it should be remarked that @xmath35 by examining fig.[angular - dependent ] .",
    "we will calculate the results for an anti - clockwise rotation ( @xmath36 ) only .",
    "the results for a clockwise rotation can be found similarly .",
    "in this section , we report the separation and angular dependence of the force between the spheres",
    ". we will calculate the radial component ( @xmath37 ) and the tangential component ( @xmath38 ) of the force and discuss their dependence on @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath40 for convenience .    in fig.[force - distance - dependent ] , we plot the radial force between the spheres against the separation parameter @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42 .",
    "two cases are considered , namely , the transverse and longitudinal field cases . in the transverse ( longitudinal ) field case , the line joining the spheres is perpendicular ( parallel ) to the applied field .",
    "we first examine the transverse field case , with @xmath39 being chosen to be 0.1 , 1 and 10 respectively .",
    "the dielectric contrast is chosen to be @xmath43 ( low contrast ) and @xmath44 ( high contrast ) . from fig.[force - distance - dependent ] , our results show that the rotational motion of the particle generally reduces the force between the particles . in order to see the effects more clearly , we plot in fig.[force4-distance - dependent ] the products @xmath45 and @xmath46 against @xmath41 .",
    "it can be seen that for a large separation @xmath47 , these quantities tend to constant , indicating that the force varies as @xmath48 . for a small separation @xmath49 ,",
    "the magnitude of the transverse force increases rapidly .",
    "the longitudinal field case shows a similar behavior : the rotational motion generally reduces the magnitude of the interparticle force .",
    "we next discuss the angular dependence of the interparticle force ( fig.[force - angular - dependent ] ) .",
    "we concentrate on the radial component @xmath50 first .",
    "we can see that , for a small angular velocity @xmath51 , the radial component attains its minimum and maximum value at @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , which correspond to the longitudinal and transverse field case ( fig.[force - distance - dependent ] ) . for the tangential force , @xmath54 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is expected because when the angular velocity of the particle is small , the effect of rotation can be neglected .",
    "however , when the sphere rotates faster @xmath57 , the peak shifts towards the direction of smaller @xmath58 .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn for the tangential force . in the lower panels of fig.[force - angular - dependent ] ,",
    "the tangential force no longer vanishes at @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath59 . from the above results , we conclude that the nonrotating particle is forced to move in the direction of increasing @xmath58 .",
    "more precisely , if originally the two particles are at @xmath56 while there is no rotational motion , the particles will repel each other and there is no tangential motion . however , if one of the particle begins to rotate , a tangential force will act on the other particle , forcing it to move downwards , since @xmath60 at @xmath56 .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "when the angular velocity is large ( @xmath61 ) , the peak of the radial force will return to the original position ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , and @xmath62 when @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the force is reduced to nearly one half of its original value ( fig.[force - mag - angular - dependent ] ) .",
    "it is because when the angular velocity is large , from @xmath63 and @xmath18 ( fig.[angular - dependent ] ) , the magnitude of the steady - state dipole moment will be small .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of a polarized sphere interacting with a dielectric sphere with a vanishing polarization charge .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in this work ,",
    "only one of the particles has been assumed to rotate . in a realistic situation",
    ", all the particles can rotate .",
    "as our theory is general , it can readily be applied to the case when all the particles are in rotational motion .",
    "so far , our proposed relaxation time has no microscopic origin .",
    "if the relaxation process is originated from a finite conductivity of the particle or host medium , then we can estimate the relaxation time based on the maxwell - wagner theory of leaky dielectrics @xcite .",
    "for a ( nonrotating ) spherical inclusion embedded in a host medium , the expression is @xmath64 where @xmath65 denote the conductivity of the sphere and host medium respectively .",
    "we may extend the maxwell - wagner theory to polarization relaxation of rotating particles . in this case",
    ", we should add a term @xmath66 to the polarization current density , where @xmath67 is the polarization charge density and @xmath68 is the rotating velocity .",
    "however , it is not possible to convert the extra term into a dielectric constant and the generalization becomes more complicated due to the nonuniform polarization charge density inside the rotating spherical inclusions .",
    "we are currently examining the solution of the more complicated boundary - value problem .",
    "however , we can make a crude estimate of the relaxation time . according to the geometry of the rotating sphere",
    ", the relaxation of polarization charge can be along the particle - fluid interface , so @xmath69 when @xmath0 is large compared with @xmath1 and @xmath70 ( insulating host medium ) , both the expressions for @xmath11 reduce to the same result .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a model to calculate the interparticle force between a pair of dielectric spheres , in which one sphere is held fixed and the other is in rotational motion .",
    "we have calculated the force between the spheres by using the multiple image method .",
    "we have found that the effect of rotation is large when the angular velocity of the sphere is large ( @xmath71 ) . to investigate the dynamic er effects ,",
    "we have solved a differential equation which describes the dynamic polarization of the rotating particles .",
    "the theoretical problem described here can be realized in experiments @xcite .",
