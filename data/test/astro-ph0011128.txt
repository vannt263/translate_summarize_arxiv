    "the first detection of an extrasolar planet around a normal star ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) and subsequent deluge of similar discoveries by the radial velocity technique ( marcy , cochran & mayor 2000 ) , have taught us that @xmath05% of solar type stars harbor planetary systems very _ unlike _ our own .",
    "what remains to be determined is the abundance of planetary systems _ similar _ to that of the sun s ( eg . , terrestrial planets at @xmath00.5 - 2  au or jovian analogs at @xmath03 - 12  au ) and the frequency of planets around the most common stars in our galaxy , m dwarfs .",
    "microlensing is providing the first partial answers to these questions .",
    "microlensing occurs whenever a massive compact object ( such as a star , black hole , etc . )",
    "passes very near the line - of - sight to a background luminous source . in the case of a single point lens , two images of the source",
    "are formed with a separation that scales with the angular radius of the einstein ring , @xmath1^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the mass of the lens , its distance , and the distance to the source , respectively . for sources in the galactic bulge ,",
    "this separation is @xmath01  mas , and thus generally too close to be resolved .",
    "the combined image brightness , however , can be observed and is a function of the changing projected distance between the lens and the observer - source line - of - sight . as the source moves through the axisymmetric magnification pattern generated by a single lens , a symmetric light curve results .",
    "this symmetry is destroyed for multiple lenses such as binary star systems or planetary systems .",
    "more complicated magnification patterns are formed , and the resulting light curve depends on the angle @xmath6 of the source trajectory . for binary lenses , the topology of the magnification map ( fig .",
    "1 ) depends on only two parameters : the mass ratio @xmath7 of the lenses and their projected separation @xmath8 in units of the einstein ring radius . for typical galactic lenses , m dwarfs in the bulge or inner disk ,",
    "the physical size of the einstein radius is @xmath9  au . because typical @xmath10 are comparable to the orbital radius of many solar system planets , microlensing is an excellent way to search for planets , as first suggested by mao & paczynki ( 1991 ) and further developed by gould & loeb ( 1992 ) .",
    "0.0cm=12.5 cm -4.25 cm    -0.5 cm    figure  1 shows the differential magnification effect of binary lenses as a function of their mass ratio @xmath11 and separation @xmath12 .",
    "each panel covers an area @xmath13 on a side centered on the more massive primary lens .",
    "the brightness of an image is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the jacobian that describes the coordinate transformation between the image and source planes .",
    "the locus of points in the source plane for which @xmath16 is called the `` caustic curve . '' a source crossing the caustic will be highly magnified .",
    "-8.5 cm -0.5 cm",
    "-1 cm    since most microlensing events are alerted in real time only when the source lies near or inside @xmath17 , a light curve will reveal the binarity of the lens ( via an anomaly @xmath18 ) only if the source trajectory passes over the contours shown in fig  1 .",
    "otherwise , the light curve will be indistinguishable from that due to a single isolated lens .",
    "figure  2 illustrates this effect ; two possible source trajectories are shown passing the same distance from the `` central '' caustic , but different distances from the two , outer `` planetary '' caustics ( all three caustics are caused by the lens - planet combination ) .",
    "the light curve associated with only one of these trajectories betrays the presence of the planet . since the deviation contours are most extended for @xmath11 and @xmath12 of order unity ( fig .  1 )",
    ", these types of binary lenses will be the easiest to detect .",
    "even planets as small as the earth generate caustic structures as they orbit galactic lenses ; background sources passing over or near these caustics will experience a substantial additional microlensing effect due to the binarity of the lens .",
    "the cross section of the planetary caustic and thus the probability that a random trajectory will pass over or near it decreases slowly with mass ratio ( dominik 1999 ) .",
    "for this reason , microlensing  unlike most other planet detection methods  has _ sensitivity _ to terrestrial - mass planets .",
    "this sensitivity is limited primarily by the sampling rate and precision of the photometry required to see signals that are reduced in amplitude by finite source effects for @xmath19 .",
    "the _ efficiency _ with which planets of given @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be detected in a given light curve is a statistical quantity that depends on the photometric precision , sampling and duration of the photometric data and on the characteristics of the underlying event sampled , most notably its minimum impact parameter , @xmath20 , and the amount of blended non - lensed light in the same resolution element ( gaudi & sackett 2000 ) .",
    "determination of detection efficiencies for individual light curves allows non - detections to be translated into statistical upper limits for a given class of planet .      in principle",
    ", the _ detection _ of a microlensing anomaly can be quantified statistically , but its clear identification with a planetary lens relies on the _ characterization _ of the planet through determination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since any given event will not repeat , characterization must be obtained at the time of detection , and will require better data . with sufficient data quality , both @xmath12 and @xmath11 can be determined from light curve modeling , although in some cases the well - known @xmath21 `` degeneracy '' ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ; dominik 1999 ) will prevent a unique identification .",
    "high magnification events are sensitive and reasonably efficient to the detection of small mass planets since their small @xmath20 brings them close to the central caustic generated by companions ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , such detections may be particularly difficult to characterize , since all planets orbiting the primary lens will distort the central caustic ( gaudi , naber & sackett 1998 ) ; more massive ones will have an effect over a larger range of @xmath12 .",
    "di  stefano and scalzo ( 1999 ) point out that current programs typically halt intensive monitoring when @xmath22 ; extended high - precision monitoring may detect and characterize planets at larger separation from their host lenses",

    "of 21 light curves consistent with binary lenses analyzed by macho , two produced acceptable fits with companion masses as small @xmath23 ( alcock et al .",
    "the first suggestion of possible planetary - mass lenses ( bennett et al .  1997 ) came from macho survey data for macho  1994-blg-4 , which could be modelled as an m - dwarf/5@xmath24 pair , and macho  1995-blg-3 , a very short duration event modelled as an isolated 2@xmath24 lens .",
    "however , many alternate interpretations were allowed by the infrequently sampled light curves inherent to survey data ( which must sample @xmath0@xmath25 stars nightly ! ) ; no firm planetary detection was claimed in either case .",
    "the timescale @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the relative proper motion of lens and source ) of typical galactic microlensing events is weeks to months ; whereas planetary ( @xmath28 ) anomalies would have durations of hours to days . the necessity of round - the - clock monitoring for detection and characterization of short - lived planetary deviations prompted the establishment of international collaborations such as mps ( rhie et al .",
    "2000 ) and planet ( albrow et al .  1998 ) , which obtain sub - day to sub - hourly photometry on events discovered by the survey teams macho , ogle and eros .",

    "bennett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) interpreted the double caustic structure as coming from a static triple system , a jovian planet orbiting a stellar binary .",
    "the planet team , modeling their own data , instead showed that the light curve could be fit as a normal stellar binary ( albrow et al .",
