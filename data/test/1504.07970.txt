    "though the standard model ( sm ) is established by the discovery of the sm - like higgs boson , new physics beyond the sm are still required for solving several serious problems such as a mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , a origin of tiny neutrino masses , and a candidate of the dark matter ( dm ) ,    it is interesting to focus on the scenarios which solves these three problems at around the tev scale , _",
    "i.e. _ the electroweak baryogenesis@xcite for the mechanism for producing bau , radiative seesaw scenarios for the origin of tiny neutrino masses , and introducing weak interacting massive particles as candidates of the dm .",
    "many nice models in such a direction have been developed in literature .",
    "in particular , the aoki - kanemura - seto ( aks ) model@xcite is an attractive example which includes all the three mechanisms .",
    "however , in the aks model , it is known that a landau pole appears at the scale much below the planck scale .",
    "it means that there should be a more fundamental theory above a cutoff scale . in the following , we review a candidate of such a fundamental theory proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on a supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theory with confinement .",
    "it is known that confinement occurs in the su@xmath2 susy gauge theory with @xmath3 flavours when @xmath4 is satisfied@xcite .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we utilize this simplest setup and propose a susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are made light by introducing additional fields . on the other hand , all the mesonic fields listed in table  [ fieldcontent]-(ii ) play an important role in our model . ] in order to forbid tree level contributions to neutrino masses , an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry is introduced to the model .",
    "we also introduce a right - handed neutrino ( rhn ) superfield which has odd number under the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the assignment of the sm charge and the @xmath1-parity on the su(2)@xmath0 doublets and the rhn is shown in table  [ fieldcontent]-(i ) .    in this framework ,",
    "the su(2)@xmath0 gauge coupling becomes strong at a certain scale @xmath9 , and the low energy effective theory below @xmath9 is described in terms of the fifteen mesonic fields listed in the table  [ fieldcontent]-(ii ) , where the mesonic superfields are canonically normalized as @xmath10 .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector in the low energy effective theory can be written as @xmath11 it is naively expected that @xmath12 at the confinement scale @xmath9 . the relevant part of the soft susy breaking lagrangian is given by @xmath13 after the @xmath1-even neutral fields @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 get vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) , the mass parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are induced .",
    "the yukawa couplings and the majorana mass term of the rhn are given by @xmath19    cc ( i)&(ii ) +    .(i ) the charge assignment under the sm gauge group ( su(3)@xmath20su(2)@xmath21u(1)@xmath22 and the @xmath1 parity on the su(2)@xmath0 doublets @xmath23 and the rhn @xmath24 .",
    "( ii ) the field content of the extended higgs sector or the low energy effective theory of the susy su(2)@xmath0 model .",
    "[ fieldcontent ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition , the direct search of inert doublet particles@xcite and inert charged singlet searches@xcite at ilc can also provide a strong hint on the @xmath1-odd sector of the scenario .",
    "we have attempted to propose a simple model to explain the three problems such as baryogenesis , tiny neutrino mass , and dm in its low energy effective theory and we have succeeded to find such a model based on susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory with confinement . we have introduced a benchmark scenario and we have discussed how to test it at future collider experiments .",
