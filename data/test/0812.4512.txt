    "the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions  in other words , more or less everything we know about in nature except gravity  are all described by gauge theory .",
    "mathematically , in a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath0 , formulated on a spacetime @xmath1 , a gauge field is a connection on a @xmath0-bundle @xmath2 . for our purposes , @xmath1 is a four - manifold with a metric of lorentz signature @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , for our purposes there is no essential loss to take @xmath1 to be minkowski spacetime @xmath4 ( that is , @xmath5 with a flat pseudo - riemannian metric of lorentz signature ) .",
    "in addition to gauge fields , in nature there also are matter fields .",
    "the matter fields describe things such as electrons , neutrinos , quarks , and possibly higgs particles .",
    "gauge fields mediate `` forces '' between particles described by matter fields ( and between additional particles described by the gauge fields themselves ) . for simplicity , in this talk , i will omit the matter fields and just describe the gauge fields .",
    "one thing i should say before getting too far is that , for a large variety of reasons , it is unrealistic , in a talk or a short article , to expect to fully describe the problem of yang - mills theory . to really appreciate the problem ,",
    "it is necessary to delve into quantum field theory in some depth .",
    "there is a large physics literature on quantum field theory , and there is also a large math literature ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "i felt in preparing the lecture that to make it comprehensible , i could not simply skip the preliminaries .",
    "one can skip the preliminaries and make some formal statements , but such statements are rather opaque . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also not possible to fully explain the preliminaries in a short space or time , so i have had to seek a middle path .",
    "this inevitably involves some debateable choices of what to explain .",
    "the main idiosyncracy in my presentation is that i have decided to rely on a hamiltonian approach ( including the well - established @xcite but relatively unfamiliar notion of hamiltonian lattice gauge theory ) rather than converting everything to path integrals .",
    "the path integral approach is very powerful but involves an extra layer of abstraction .    classically , there is no problem to explain what is meant by yang - mills gauge theory . a gauge field , that is a connection @xmath6 on a @xmath0-bundle @xmath2 , has a curvature @xmath7 .",
    "the curvature is a two - form on @xmath1 valued in the adjoint bundle @xmath8 derived from @xmath9 .",
    "the classical yang - mills equations are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hodge star ( mapping two - forms to @xmath12-forms , where @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is the gauge - covariant extension of the exterior derivative",
    ".    the yang - mills equations may be most familiar in the abelian case , that is in the case that @xmath15 .",
    "maxwell s equations of electromagnetism ( in vacuum ) can be described in terms of a two - form @xmath16 that obeys @xmath17 the first of these equations is the yang - mills equation as written in eqn .",
    "( [ zurf ] ) .",
    "( recall that @xmath18 reduces to @xmath19 when @xmath0 is abelian . )",
    "we can omit the second equation if we define @xmath20 as the curvature of a connection @xmath6 , for it is then an identity  the bianchi identity .    for @xmath15 ,",
    "maxwell s equations describe propagation of light waves in vacuum .",
    "these are linear equations , so , for example , in the approximation that maxwell s equations are valid , two beams of light pass through each other without scattering .",
    "( in a more precise description of nature , there are all sorts of corrections to maxwell s equations , involving things such as quantum mechanics , electrons , and gravity , so it is not expected that the propagation of light is precisely linear even in vacuum .",
    "the nonlinearities are expected to be very small and have not yet been observed , though it is believed that this may be possible in the near future . )    in the nonabelian case , the yang - mills equations @xmath21 are _ nonlinear _ wave equations .",
    "so classical yang - mills waves do scatter each other , although in the case of weak waves , the nonlinearities and the scattering effects are small . in this respect , the yang - mills equations are analogous to the vacuum einstein equations @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the ricci tensor ) .",
    "they are nonlinear hyperbolic wave equations .        having a hyperbolic wave equation means that , optimistically speaking , solutions of the equation are in one - to - one correspondence with initial data , given on a global cauchy hypersurface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between yang - mills theory and general relativity . in general relativity",
    "there is a phenomenon of gravitational collapse  the formation of a black hole . as a result ,",
    "a solution on a cauchy hypersurface can not be extended for all times , in general . in yang - mills theory , instead , there is a global - in - time existence result for classical solutions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is probably one of the reasons that quantum yang - mills theory is simpler than quantum gravity , though it is not one of the reasons that is easiest to interpret .    for gauge group @xmath15",
    ", we observe classical solutions of maxwell s equations all the time  light waves .",
    "for nonabelian @xmath0 , even though there are beautiful nonlinear classical wave equations , we do not observe these nonlinear classical waves in practice .",
    "that is actually because of a phenomenon known as the mass gap .",
    "the mass gap means that the description in terms of nonlinear classical waves is only a good approximation above a certain minimum energy and frequency . at lower energies and frequencies",
    ", one must use quantum field theory rather than classical field theory .",
    "according to theory , physical conditions that are well - described by classical nonlinear wave equations can exist , but because of the minimum frequency involved , our technology does not enable use to generate the appropriate initial conditions . in practice ,",
    "all manifestations of yang - mills theory that we observe , except in the abelian case , involve quantum behavior  that is , they involve phenomena that can not be described by the classical field equations . that is why the role of yang - mills theory in physics can not be described without talking about the quantum theory .",
    "formally speaking , the starting point in going to the quantum theory is to observe that what i will call @xmath24 , the space of all solutions of the classical yang - mills equations modulo gauge transformations , is an ( infinite - dimensional ) symplectic manifold .",
    "the real reason for this is that the yang - mills equations are not just equations .",
    "they are the euler - lagrange equations associated with an action function @xmath25 here @xmath26 is an invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra of @xmath0 , and @xmath27 is a constant , known as the gauge coupling constant .    in general , starting with any action , the space of classical solutions of the euler - lagrange equations , modulo the relevant gauge equivalence , is always a symplectic manifold .",
    "quantization has to do with quantizing this symplectic manifold .",
    "actually , @xmath24 is a cotangent bundle .",
    "this can be established as follows .",
    "pick an initial value surface @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 be the space of all gauge fields on @xmath30 ( that is all connections on a @xmath0-bundle @xmath31 ) modulo gauge equivalence .",
    "then @xmath24 is the cotangent bundle of @xmath32 , for any choice of @xmath30 . in effect , to specify a classical solution of yang - mills theory corresponding to a point in @xmath24 , we must pick an initial value of the gauge field along @xmath30  that is a point in @xmath32  and also , as the yang - mills equations are of second order , we must specify the normal derivative to the gauge field along @xmath30 . by forgetting the normal derivative , we get a map @xmath33 , and @xmath24 is the cotangent bundle to @xmath32 .    in finite dimensions , there is no problem in quantizing a cotangent bundle . but @xmath24 is infinite - dimensional , and in infinite dimensions , we have to be careful . for an elementary illustration of the problem , recall that by a well - known theorem of stone and von neumann , the quantization of @xmath34 , with a symplectic structure that comes from a nondegenerate skew form , is unique ( provided that one requires that this quantization should admit an action of the heisenberg group , the central extension of the group of translations of @xmath34 ) . the analog of this for @xmath35 is more subtle .",
    "we need more information about what sort of answer we want to get .",
    "the additional information is that the energy should be bounded below . with this information",
    ", quantization becomes unique again , at least in the abelian case , as we will explain .",
    "instead of just describing the energy in an ad hoc way , let us provide a framework for this discussion .",
    "our yang - mills action ( [ folf ] ) is invariant under the symmetries of the pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath1 .",
    "classically , we need only endow @xmath1 with a conformal structure ( rather than a metric ) , since the action is defined using the hodge star operator @xmath11 , and in four - dimensions , this operator is conformally - invariant when acting on two - forms .",
    "we take @xmath1 to be minkowski spacetime @xmath36 , with its standard conformal structure ( induced from a flat pseudo - riemannian metric ) .",
    "the group of conformal motions of @xmath1 ( or more precisely of its conformal compactification ) is @xmath37 , and this is a group of symmetries of the classical theory .    for @xmath15 , @xmath37",
    "is realized as a group of symmetries of the quantum theory , but this is actually not true for nonabelian @xmath0 .",
    "the quantum theory is obtained via a kind of limiting procedure , concerning which i will try to give a few hints .",
    "this limiting procedure does not preserve the full @xmath37 symmetry , but only a subgroup .",
    "the details depend on exactly how one proceeds with quantization .",
    "a maximal subgroup of @xmath37 that can be preserved in the quantization , for nonabelian @xmath0 , is the subgroup @xmath38  known as the poincar group  that preserves a flat metric on @xmath36 .",
    "this group acts on linear coordinates @xmath39 on @xmath36 by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a constant `` translation , '' and @xmath42 is a linear transformation that belongs to the lorentz group @xmath43 ( the group of symmetries of a quadratic form of lorentz signature ) . we are supposed to quantize in such a way that we get a unitary representation of @xmath38 .",
    "representation theory of @xmath38 is simple because @xmath38 is an extension : @xmath44 here @xmath4 is the abelian group of translations .",
    "its spectrum defines a point in the dual space to @xmath4 .",
    "this dual space , which i will denote @xmath45 , is usually called momentum space . of course",
    ", @xmath45 is also endowed with a flat metric .",
    "( we could use the metrics to identify them , but this would be confusing . )    we write @xmath46 for a point in @xmath45 , usually called the energy - momentum .",
    "the condition @xmath47 defines a cone , called the light cone .",
    "@xmath46 is said to be lightlike if it lies on this cone . as is usual in lorentz signature ,",
    "the light cone is the union of two components , the `` past '' and `` future '' parts of the light cone .",
    "the future light cone is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "we want a quantization such that the spectrum of energy - momentum lies inside ( and on ) the future light cone .",
    "this is usually described by saying that the energy is bounded below by zero . here",
    ", energy is a suitable linear function on @xmath45 .",
    "boundary points of the future light cone are allowed , but they play a very special role .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath48 that we get by quantization is supposed to have a special state , the vacuum state @xmath49 , whose energy - momentum is supported at the apex of the cone , in other words at the point @xmath50 .",
    "this state transforms in a one - dimensional trivial representation of the poincar group .",
    "o apart from this one trivial representation , the other representations that are relevant are constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be a non - trivial @xmath52 orbit that is inside , or on , the future light cone .",
    "let @xmath53 be a homogeneous vector bundle over @xmath54 .",
    "then the space of @xmath55 sections of @xmath56 is a positive energy representation of the poincar group , and , apart from the trivial representation that corresponds to the vacuum state , these are the representations that we allow .",
    "looks like when there is a `` mass gap . ''",
    "apart from the isolated eigenvalue at @xmath57 corresponding to the vacuum , there is in this example a single discrete eigenvalue of @xmath58 at a positive value .",
    "there is also a continuous spectrum ( corresponding to multiparticle states ) which begins at twice the value of the smallest positive eigenvalue.,width=336 ]    an orbit is characterized by the invariant @xmath59 .",
    "this invariant is non - negative ( since we consider only orbits inside or on the light cone ) , and @xmath58 , defined by the positive square root , is called the mass .",
    "@xmath58 can have either a discrete or a continuous spectrum .",
    "more exactly , in quantum field theory , @xmath58 always has a continuous spectrum ( from what are known as multiparticle states ) above some minimum value @xmath60 .",
    "there may also be a discrete spectrum from single particle states with @xmath61 .",
    "positive discrete eigenvalues of @xmath58 are called masses of particles",
    ".    the vacuum state always has @xmath57 .",
    "if this is a discrete eigenvalue of @xmath58 , in other words if there is @xmath62 such that every state orthogonal to the vacuum has @xmath63 , then we say that the theory has a mass gap . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we sketch a typical spectrum of a quantum field theory with a mass gap .",
    "the discrete eigenvalues of @xmath58 are 0 and one positive value .",
    "now , let us examine the problem of quantizing gauge theory , armed with the information that the energy should be non - negative .",
    "classically , if we write the curvature in non - relativistic terms as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the electric and magnetic fields , then the energy is the conserved quantity @xmath67 it is non - negative , and vanishes precisely for the trivial solution with @xmath68 .",
    "we next discuss the quantization , beginning with the abelian case , that is @xmath15 . in the abelian case",
    ", the curvature @xmath16 is linear in the connection @xmath6 , that is @xmath20 , and maxwell s equations @xmath69 are also linear .",
    "the space @xmath70 of solutions modulo gauge transformations is therefore also a linear space  an infinite - dimensional one .    now in the case of a _",
    "finite_-dimensional affine space , @xmath34 for some @xmath71 , quantization is unique ( once one requires that it should respect the affine structure , in a suitable sense ) according to a theorem of stone and von neumann .",
    "this is far from being true in infinite dimensions .",
    "quantization of an infinite - dimensional affine or linear space @xmath70 is far from unique .",
    "but we do get the uniqueness again if we are given a positive - definite quadratic function @xmath72 on @xmath70 , and we ask for a quantization in which @xmath72 is represented by a hermitian operator that is bounded below .    in abelian gauge theory , because the curvature is a linear function , the hamiltonian or energy function @xmath73 is a quadratic function , which moreover is positive - definite .",
    "this puts us in the situation just described .",
    "h the result of quantization can be described as follows .",
    "as the space of solutions of maxwell s equations , @xmath70 has a natural symplectic structure .",
    "this symplectic structure is translation - invariant  that is , it comes from a constant two - form ( on the infinite - dimensional linear space @xmath70 ) .",
    "the positive - definite quadratic function @xmath72 on @xmath70 is equivalent to a translation - invariant riemannian metric on @xmath70 . combining these ,",
    "@xmath70 is endowed with a translation - invariant complex structure and therefore can be regarded as a complex vector space with a hermitian metric , that is , a hilbert space .",
    "let us write @xmath74 for @xmath70 regarded in this way as a hilbert space .",
    "quantization of @xmath70 is supposed to give us a hilbert space @xmath75 .",
    "this turns out to be the hilbert space completion of the `` fock space '' constructed from @xmath74 , which by definition is @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the @xmath71-fold symmetric product of @xmath70 , with @xmath78 .    in ( [ puik ] )",
    ", @xmath79 is the one - dimensional space of `` vacuum '' states ( poincar - invariant states of zero energy , as discussed earlier ) .",
    "@xmath80 is the space of `` single - particle states . ''",
    "concretely , as a representation of the conformal group , @xmath74 is the space of sections of a certain homogeneous vector bundle over the future light cone .",
    "( in four dimensions , this bundle is of rank 2 , the number of polarization states of an electromagnetic wave . )",
    "support on the cone means that @xmath74 is a space of massless states , that is states of @xmath81 .",
    "these are called the one - photon states .",
    "similarly , @xmath77 is the space of @xmath71-photon states .",
    "this is our answer for quantization of abelian gauge theory , though we need to say more about the physical interpretation in terms of photons , and about how various classical expressions are realized as operators acting on this hilbert space .",
    "endowed with a function with a unique isolated minimum , indicated by the black dot.,width=240 ]    now let us discuss the nonabelian case .",
    "the curvature @xmath16 is no longer linear , so the space @xmath82 of classical solutions is no longer a linear or affine space .",
    "similarly , the energy function @xmath73 is not quadratic .",
    "however , it is still true , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , that @xmath73 is positive semidefinite with a unique zero corresponding to the trivial solution @xmath68 .    like any function with an isolated minimum",
    ", @xmath73 looks quadratic near its minimum .",
    "one may ask whether this simple fact can be a starting point for understanding the quantization .",
    "the constant @xmath83 in @xmath73 is very important . in general",
    ", suppose that we have a not - quadratic function @xmath73 of variables @xmath84 with a minimum at the origin : @xmath85 we write @xmath86 , so that @xmath87    we do not know how to diagonalize @xmath73 as an operator in a hilbert space , but we can diagonalize its quadratic part @xmath88 : @xmath89 this means that if @xmath27 is small , we can approximately diagonalize @xmath73 .",
    "the first step is to diagonalize @xmath88 , and then one makes successive corrections , treating the higher order terms in @xmath73 as perturbations , so as to construct the eigenfunctions of @xmath73 in an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath27 .",
    "classically it does not make sense to say that @xmath27 is large or small ; @xmath27 is just an uninteresting constant multiplying the action .",
    "but quantum mechanically there is a dimensionless number that in the usual units is @xmath90 .",
    "this is really the small parameter in the asymptotic expansion that was just suggested . in this asymptotic expansion ,",
    "one diagonalizes @xmath73  and computes all quantities of physical interest  in an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath90 .",
    "there is really a lot to explain here .",
    "there are many important details and techniques in constructing the formal expansion , and there is actually much more to explain about what are the interesting and important things to calculate .",
    "the techniques include feynman diagrams , renormalization , path integrals , gauge fixing , and brst symmetry .",
    "what one wants to calculate are masses , other static quantities such as magnetic moments and other matrix elements of local operators , and especially scattering amplitudes .",
    "after a lot of work , one does end up with a systematic asymptotic expansion .",
    "moreover , there are many physics problems for which the asymptotic expansion is enough , in practice .",
    "that is the case for the electromagnetic and weak interactions , because @xmath91 is small ( roughly 1/137 for electromagnetism ) .",
    "apart from the fact that the asymptotic expansion  known as perturbation theory  is satisfactory for many questions , it is important in another way : it is unrealistic to expect to develop an exact theory without having a thorough understanding of perturbation theory . trying to do this would be somewhat analogous to trying to study riemannian geometry without learning linear algebra .",
    "however , to understand the strong interactions , or nuclear force , the asymptotic expansion is not enough . we need to understand something about the exact theory .",
    "i will therefore conclude by trying to say something about this .",
    "any known approach to understanding the exact theory requires , one way or another , modifying it by introducing a `` cut - off '' so as to make the number of variables effectively finite , and then taking a limit in which the cutoff is removed .",
    "the usual way to do this is via euclidean lattice gauge theory , but we will not follow that route because in this lecture we have avoided introducing path integrals .",
    "( for an introduction to that subject , see for instance @xcite . ) instead , i will describe the hamiltonian version of lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "this approach is not widely used in practice , though possibly it could be useful . at any rate , whether or not this approach is useful in practice , it is easily described and gives a good orientation about what it means to introduce a cut - off and then remove it .",
    "a fact that was mentioned in section 2 is helpful here .",
    "this concerns the space @xmath70 of solutions of the yang - mills equations modulo gauge transformations .",
    "pick an initial value hypersurface @xmath30 ; we may as well simply take @xmath30 to be a `` time zero '' subspace @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the space of gauge connections on @xmath94 and @xmath95 the group of gauge transformations on @xmath96 .",
    "thus the quotient @xmath97 is the space of connections modulo gauge transformations on @xmath96 . and @xmath70 can be identified as a cotangent bundle , @xmath98 .",
    "the idea behind this identification is that to determine a classical solution , we must give the initial value of the connection ( a point in @xmath99 ) and its time derivative ( a cotangent vector ) .",
    "so to get a finite - dimensional approximation to @xmath70 , it suffices to get finite - dimensional approximations to @xmath93 and @xmath95 .        to do this",
    ", we approximate @xmath96 by a finite set @xmath100 of points  later we will take the number of points to infinity .",
    "in fact , as in fig . [ fig5 ] , we arrange the finite set of points in a regular array , as part of a lattice . actually , it is better to consider a discrete approximation to a three - torus , rather than a discrete approximation to a parallelepiped in @xmath96 as sketched in the figure .",
    "this avoids edge effects in the spectrum of the hamiltonian . a discrete approximation to a three - torus is made by taking an array of points that is finite and is periodic in three directions .",
    "the limit is still taken by letting the number of points in the array go to infinity ( so that it approximates a larger and larger three - torus ) while the distance between nearest neighbor points goes to zero .",
    "] of course , a finite set of points is not a very good approximation to @xmath96 . to recover @xmath96",
    ", we increase the number of points . in the process",
    ", we must improve the approximation in two directions : we take the spacing between the lattice points to be smaller and smaller , so as to recover the continuum , while also taking the spatial extent of our chosen array of points to be bigger and bigger , so that in the limit the array of points covers all of @xmath96 .",
    "so now , for each such finite set @xmath100 , we must give an approximation to @xmath93 , the space of all connections , and @xmath95 , the group of gauge transformations .",
    "taking @xmath100 to be part of a rectangular lattice , we connect the nearest neighbor pairs , as is shown in the figure",
    ". then we approximate gauge theory by only allowing parallel transport along lattice paths . for each oriented link @xmath101 between nearest neighbors in @xmath100",
    ", we introduce a group element @xmath102 that describes parallel transport along @xmath101 ( we take @xmath103 ) . by a connection on the finite lattice corresponding to @xmath100 ,",
    "we mean a collection of group elements @xmath104 for all @xmath101 .",
    "so our finite - dimensional approximation to @xmath93 is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the number of nearest neighbor pairs in @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , we permit ourselves to make gauge transformations at all points in @xmath100 . a gauge transformation is thus specified by giving an element @xmath107 for all @xmath108 . if @xmath101 connects points @xmath46 and @xmath109 , the gauge transformation acts on @xmath104 by @xmath110 .",
    "so our finite - dimensional approximation to the group @xmath95 of gauge transformations is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the number of points in @xmath100 .",
    "h the corresponding approximation to the space @xmath70 of classical solutions is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the space of gauge fields modulo gauge transformations .",
    "since we are in finite dimensions and @xmath115 is a cotangent bundle , quantization is straightforward : the hilbert space associated to @xmath100 is just @xmath116 .",
    "equivalently , this hilbert space is the @xmath117-invariant subspace of @xmath118 .",
    "any operator on @xmath119 that commutes with @xmath117 descends to an operator on @xmath120 .    to complete the description of the finite - dimensional approximation",
    ", we must give a suitable approximation @xmath121 to the hamiltonian or energy operator @xmath73 .",
    "it is not hard to do this .",
    "it turns out that the first term in @xmath73 , namely @xmath122 , can be approximated by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the laplace operator on the riemannian manifold @xmath125 .",
    "( @xmath126 commutes with @xmath117 , and so descends to an operator on @xmath120 by virtue of the comment at the end of the last paragraph . )",
    "the second term in @xmath73 , namely @xmath127 , is the @xmath55 norm of the curvature of a connection on the initial value surface . to approximate this for the lattice",
    "@xmath100 , the main point is to know what we mean by curvature in the context of such a finite - dimensional approximation .",
    "this can be defined in terms of parallel transport around a small loop ; in the lattice @xmath100 , the smallest possible nontrivial loops are the squares of minimal area , which in lattice gauge theory are usually called plaquettes . for any plaquette @xmath128 ,",
    "consisting of four nearest neighbor links @xmath129 , we let @xmath130 be the function on @xmath125 that associates to a connection @xmath131 the trace of the holonomy of that connection around @xmath132 ( thus , @xmath133 ; the trace is taken in the same representation used to define @xmath134 ) .",
    "then @xmath134 can be approximated by a suitable linear function of @xmath135 .",
    "( one subtracts a constant from @xmath136 so that it vanishes when @xmath137 for all @xmath101 ; and one then multiplies by a constant to get an approximation to @xmath134 . )    we also want to define lattice approximations to other expressions of classical and quantum gauge theory .",
    "but i will not go farther ; the examples that have been given hopefully suffice to illustrate the idea .",
    "the problem of defining quantum gauge theory is , in this formulation , to show that when we `` remove the cutoff '' by refining and enlarging the finite set @xmath100 , the lattice hamiltonian @xmath121 ( and other operators ) converge to a limit . to be an array of points that is periodic in three directions , as mentioned in footnote [ gong ]",
    "otherwise , there are edge effects at the boundary of @xmath100 and the statement that @xmath121 converges to a limit needs to be formulated carefully . ] while removing the cutoff , one must also adjust the coupling constant @xmath27 in a suitable fashion .",
    "there is a precise theory of how @xmath27 must be adjusted ; if @xmath42 is the lattice spacing ( the distance between points in @xmath100 ) , then one requires @xmath138 for @xmath139 . here",
    "@xmath140 is a constant that depends on @xmath0 ; it was computed by gross , wilczek , and politzer in 1973 .",
    "this computation led to the 2004 nobel prize for `` asymptotic freedom , '' which is the statement that @xmath27 must go to zero as @xmath42 does .",
    "for @xmath141 , it is believed that there is a limiting theory that obeys all of the axioms of quantum field theory , including invariance under the poincar group .",
    "however , it is believed that in the limit one does _ not _ recover the @xmath37 conformal symmetry of the classical theory .",
    "a very basic aspect of the violation of the conformal symmetry is that it is believed that the spectrum has a mass gap , and thus is qualitatively as depicted in fig .",
    "we recall that the mass gap means simply that the mass @xmath58 of any state ( orthogonal to the vacuum ) is bounded strictly above zero .",
    "there is no mass gap in electromagnetism ; the photon is massless , so electromagnetic waves can have any positive frequency .",
    "that is why we can experience light waves in everyday life .",
    "by contrast , the mass gap in strong interactions means that the minimum frequency needed to probe the world of @xmath142 gauge theory ( which describes the strong interactions ) is @xmath143 , where @xmath58 is the smallest mass .",
    "taking from experiment the value of the smallest mass , this frequency is of order @xmath144 , which is high enough ( with room to spare ) that this world is way outside of our ordinary experience .",
    "while it is very large compared to our ordinary experience , the mass gap is in one sense very small : it is zero in the asymptotic expansion described in section 3 . as a result",
    ", we do not have a really good way to calculate it , though we know it is there from real experiments and computer simulations .",
    "so in short , this mass gap is one of the most basic things that makes the universe the way it is , with electromagnetism obvious in everyday life and other forces only accessible to study with modern technology ."
