    "in recent years , it has become widely accepted that electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction plays a crucial role in systems with strong electronic correlations , such as high - temperature superconducting cuprates@xcite or colossal magnetoresistive manganites.@xcite a large amount of the available data on optical and transport properties has been interpreted in terms of polaronic states . in view of the complex underlying physics , however , the application of single - polaron theories seems to be problematic . on the other hand , a reliable theory of strongly coupled ep systems with finite carrier densities",
    "is not available yet . while limiting cases , such as weak coupling or large phonon frequencies  compared to the electronic bandwidth  can to some degree",
    "be described theoretically , especially the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies at intermediate - to - strong ep coupling constitutes a long - standing , open problem . since analytical results",
    "can only be obtained at the expense of uncontrolled approximations , progress toward an understanding of many - polaron systems requires unbiased numerical methods .",
    "owing to the availability of high performance computers , the latter can yield insight into the properties of basic microscopic models such as the spinless holstein model considered here .",
    "nevertheless , apart from work on the half - filled band case , where the physics is dominated by a cross over from a luttinger liquid to a peierls state , the many - polaron problem has received little attention in the past .    motivated by this situation , in the present work",
    ", we address the important issue of the effect of carrier density on the character of the quasiparticles of the system . while for very strong couplings",
    "no significant changes are expected due to the existence of rather independent small ( self - trapped ) polarons with negligible residual interaction , a density - driven cross over from a state with large polarons to a metal with weakly dressed electrons may occur in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "this problem has recently been investigated experimentally in terms of optical measurements on @xmath0 films.@xcite while small polarons have been identified as the charge carriers in the low - temperature metallic phase of the ca doped system , the weaker electron - lattice coupling in the sr doped system gives rise to large - polaron - like behavior of the optical conductivity .",
    "the effect of the finite carrier density on such extended polaronic quasiparticles has been analyzed@xcite using a recently developed weak - coupling theory.@xcite    for the case of the holstein model , the abovementioned density - driven transition from small to large polarons and finally to weakly ep - dressed electrons is expected to be possible only in one dimension ( 1d ) , where large polarons extending over more than one lattice site exist at weak coupling .",
    "existing work indicates that in higher dimensions , the electrons remain quasifree at weak coupling , and become self - trapped above a critical value of the ep coupling strength.@xcite by contrast , approximate variational calculations suggest that large polarons may also exist in @xmath1.@xcite the situation is different for frhlich - type models@xcite with long - range ep interaction , in which large polaron states exist even for strong coupling and in higher dimensions .    here",
    ", we make use of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods , and calculate the photoemission spectra for finite clusters at zero and finite temperature . due to the limitations of existing algorithms ,",
    "we develop a new grand - canonical qmc approach which is free of autocorrelations and therefore enables us to study small phonon frequencies and low temperatures .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present the model and discuss previous work , while sec .  [ sec : methods ] contains details about the methods we employed .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] gives a discussion of our numerical data , and finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the new qmc technique is described in the appendix .",
    "the spinless holstein model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates ( annihilates ) a spinless fermion at lattice site @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( annihilates ) a phonon of energy @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at site @xmath5 , and @xmath10 . while the first term describes hopping processes between neighboring lattice sites @xmath11 , the second term corresponds to the elastic and kinetic energy of the phonons . finally , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model : h ] ) represents a local coupling of the lattice displacement to the electron occupation @xmath12",
    ".    the parameters of the model are the hopping integral @xmath13 , the phonon energy @xmath8 , and the coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "the latter is related to the polaron binding energy @xmath15 via @xmath16 . by defining the dimensionless quantities @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ,",
    "we are left with two independent parameters . in the sequel",
    ", we express all energies in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice constant is taken to be unity , and periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the holstein hamiltonian  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) represents a generic model for a many - polaron system . due to the restriction to spinless fermions",
    ", on - site bipolaron formation is suppressed.@xcite    quantum fluctuations of the lattice enable the electrons to hop even in the strong - coupling regime , while in models with classical phonons translation symmetry is broken , so that no itinerant polaron states exist .",
    "along this line , the half - filled spinless holstein model has been studied in one dimension using qmc,@xcite ed,@xcite dmrg@xcite and variational methods.@xcite similar to the spinfull model at half filling , the spinless model with one electron per two lattice sites displays a quantum phase transition from a metallic state to a peierls insulating state with charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order at @xmath19 . while the insulating cdw state of the spinless model is stable for any @xmath20 in the adiabatic limit @xmath21 , it can be destroyed by quantum phonon fluctuations for @xmath22.@xcite capone _ et al._@xcite used ed to study the cross over from a single polaron to a many - electron system away from half filling . although their work is actually for the holstein - hubbard model , results are very similar to the spinless holstein model in the limit of large @xmath23 considered in ref .  .",
    "the authors found that the critical coupling for polaron formation is unaffected by the electron density in the antiadiabatic regime .",
    "finally , we would like to point out previous analytical efforts to take into account squeezing and correlation effects in many - polaron systems.@xcite",
    "in this work we use qmc , and ed in combination with the kernel polynomial method ( kpm ) , to calculate , in particular , single - particle spectra .",
    "these two approaches are characterized by different advantages and shortcomings .",
    "ed in the form used here yields exact spectra at @xmath19 with extremely high energy resolution .",
    "however , even for relatively small clusters of ten sites  the size used here  this method requires parallel supercomputers to handle the enormous hilbert space ( matrix dimension @xmath24@xmath25 ) .",
    "consequently , the momentum resolution , determined by the cluster size , is rather crude .",
    "in contrast , the grand - canonical qmc simulations can be performed on personal computers , and for larger clusters .",
    "the drawback is that ( a ) the method is limited to finite temperatures , and ( b ) the calculation of spectral properties requires the analytic continuation from imaginary time to real frequencies , which is an ill - conditioned problem .",
    "therefore , regularization techniques such as the maximum entropy method ( mem ) used here have to be applied , which offer only limited energy resolution and may introduce uncontrolled errors .",
    "for this reason , we will also present a direct comparison of ed and qmc results .      in applying existing qmc methods for the holstein model to the parameter regime considered here ,",
    "one faces extremely long autocorrelations times , as well as large statistical errors.@xcite this makes it very difficult to obtain accurate results for spectral properties , due to the use of the mem . to overcome these problems , the algorithm presented in the appendix is based on the canonical lang - firsov transformation.@xcite the latter explicitly contains the shift of the lattice equilibrium position in the presence of an electron , which is favorable for the qmc simulations .",
    "moreover , the absence of a direct coupling between the electron density and the lattice displacements in the transformed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : app : hspinless ] ) permits exact , uncorrelated sampling of the phonon degrees of freedom ( momenta ) in terms of principal components .",
    "here we have mainly used a value of @xmath26 for the inverse temperature @xmath27 . for",
    "the critical parameters studied below , accurate simulations at even lower temperatures become very demanding due to a minus - sign problem ( sec .",
    "[ sec : app : sign_results ] ) . nevertheless , we shall present results for the density of states at @xmath28 and half filling but for a reduced cluster size .",
    "note that already for @xmath26 we have @xmath29 for the values",
    "@xmath30 used in the sequel , so that direct thermal excitation of phonons is expected to be rather unimportant .",
    "for the trotter decomposition , we chose @xmath31 ( see appendix ) for static observables . owing to the larger numerical effort associated with the calculation of dynamical properties , for the latter we use @xmath32the larger error being small compared to the uncertainties introduced by the mem inversion .",
    "the trotter error in the holstein model becomes important mainly for large phonon frequencies and very strong ep interaction.@xcite since we do not consider this regime here , the abovementioned values of @xmath33 yield satisfactorily small systematic errors .",
    "away from half filling , the electron density has to be adjusted to the values of interest by varying the chemical potential @xmath34 . due to the computational effort associated with this trial - and - error procedure ,",
    "the actual band filling @xmath35 , say , is usually only very close to a desired value , e.g. , @xmath36 , but not exactly the same .",
    "furthermore , within the qmc simulations , the filling can only be determined up to a statistical error @xmath37 , similar to other observables . for the results presented here ,",
    "the relative deviation @xmath38 of the actual value in the qmc simulations from the value @xmath39 reported is always smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "the same is true for the relative statistical error @xmath41 .    to perform the continuation of the one - electron green function from imaginary time to real frequencies",
    ", we use the mem ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .  ) . the algorithm employed here",
    "incorporates an improved evidence approximation,@xcite which is less susceptible to overfitting  resulting in peaks whose position , weights and even existence are not clear  than the conventional evidence approximation.@xcite on the other hand , groups of narrowly spaced peaks are represented by an envelope if the accuracy of the qmc data is not sufficient .",
    "the proposal of an alternative evidence approximation  leading in general to stronger regularization and , consequently , lower energy resolution than the conventional approximation  may not seem advantageous at first .",
    "however , considering the great variety of different spectra compatible with the qmc data within the error bars due to the extremely ill - conditioned analytical continuation problem , we argue that it rather corresponds to choosing the `` most uninformative '' solution in the spirit of the maximum entropy principle .",
    "in fact , we found that the alternative evidence approximation yields much more consistent results than the `` classic '' evidence approximation@xcite when we subjected artificial test data to different noise while keeping the signal - to - noise ratio fixed .",
    "a detailed comparison of different regularization schemes available will be presented elsewhere .    in order to scrutinize the resulting spectra , the following",
    "test has been performed .",
    "following the idea of silver _",
    "et al._,@xcite the results from the mem applied to the original qmc data @xmath42 have been taken as an `` exact '' spectral function @xmath43 , from which mock data @xmath44 for the imaginary - time green function has been created by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : app : maxent ] ) and adding gaussian random noise of absolute size @xmath45@xmath46 , comparable to the statistical errors of the qmc results . again using the mem to invert these data , the thereby obtained spectral function @xmath47 allows to check the stability of the mem result @xmath43 with respect to statistical errors .",
    "we find that the features in our results for @xmath43 remain stable if @xmath48 varies within the statistical errors , so that the data presented below are satisfactorily reliable apart from the aforementioned broadening and the limited energy resolution .",
    "while our method is completely free of autocorrelations between subsequent phonon configurations , results for the imaginary - time green function at different times are usually not statistically independent.@xcite however , in the present case , owing to the exact sampling and the large number of measurements , these correlations are very small and have been neglected since they have negligible influence on the results .",
    "an additional , stringent test of the qmc results consists of a comparison to ed data which will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results : intermediate ] .",
    "finally , we note that all qmc simulations have been run on personal computers ( e.g. , intel xeon 2600 mhz ) , with cpu times varying between several hours and a couple of days .",
    "the combination of ed and kpm has been described in detail in ref .  .",

    "the largest matrix dimension in the present calculations was about @xmath59 , running on six compute nodes of a hitachi sr8000-f1 .",
    "the energy resolution of the kpm spectral function with 512 moments has been enhanced by a factor of 8 by the mem,@xcite resulting in a significantly better resolution compared to , e.g. , the spectral decoding method .",
    "we would like to point out that in contrast to the case of qmc , the ed data to which the mem is applied does not have a statistical error .",
    "it is long known that within the holstein model  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) , a single electron undergoes a cross over to a small polaron at a critical value of the ep coupling.@xcite the important question to be addressed here is what happens if the density of electrons ( or polarons ) is increased .",
    "we do not expect significant changes in the strong - coupling regime due to the rather ",
    "localized \" nature of the small polaron state . on the contrary , for intermediate ep interaction and @xmath60 ,",
    "each electron is surrounded by a phonon cloud extending over several lattice sites .",
    "now , at larger densities , a substantial overlap of the single - particle wavefunctions occurs , leading to a dissociation of the individual polarons and finally to a restructuring of the whole many - particle ground state .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that squeezing effects reduce the polaronic band - narrowing in the many - electron case,@xcite thereby favoring such a scenario . since within the holstein model , a large polaron state",
    "is expected to be stable in 1d , we will only consider this case in the sequel .    in view of the situation in most polaronic materials",
    ", we mainly consider the adiabatic regime , taking @xmath61 .",
    "to illustrate the important differences between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , however , some results for the antiadiabatic value @xmath64 will also be shown .",
    "as we shall see below , the spectra in the intermediate coupling region turn out to have a fairly complex structure .",
