    "several resonant - mass gravitational wave antennas are now in continuous operation with strain sensitivities of the order @xmath0 @xcite . with further improvements to these detectors and the addition of several large laser interferometers now under construction @xcite ,",
    "the prospects for gravitational wave astronomy are quite good .",
    "the underlying non - gravitational physics associated with these detectors is reasonably understood and further improvements can be based on solid technological guidelines .    many believe the next generation of resonant - mass antennas will be of spherical shape @xcite . confirmed detection of gravitational waves will require a coincidence between several detectors , thus the unique features of a sphere may play an essential role in a network of gravitational wave antennas .",
    "two important features of a sphere are its equal sensitivity to gravitational waves from all directions and polarizations and its ability to determine the directional information and tensorial character of a gravitational wave @xcite .    to take full advantage of these capabilities , one needs to be able to interpret the data such a detector will produce .",
    "recently , much work has been done to understand the output of a spherical antenna equipped with resonant transducers @xcite .",
    "all of these proposals operate on the principle that the response of the transducers can be transformed into a quantity that has a one - to - one correspondence with the tensorial components of a gravitational wave . with the measurement of these components ,",
    "it is possible to solve the inverse problem to obtain the direction and polarization amplitudes of a gravitational wave .",
    "the solution to the inverse problem for a noiseless spherical antenna first was outlined in the mid 1970 s by wagoner and paik @xcite .",
    "more recently , the solution for a network of five noiseless bar antennas or interferometers was solved by dhurandhar and tinto @xcite .",
    "this method assumed that the detectors were co - located but oriented in different directions .",
    "this solution is quite elegant because the exact solution can be found using straightforward algebra . since a sphere can be thought of as five bar detectors occupying the same space , this solution can be adapted for a spherical antenna @xcite .",
    "in addition , lobo outlined a procedure that can be used if the correct theory of gravity is not general relativity but unknown @xcite .",
    "what all these proposals have in common is that they use basic symmetry properties of the matrices describing the detectors and their response to a gravitational wave .",
    "this makes them intuitive and easy to visualize @xcite .",
    "the solution to the inverse problem in the presence of noise is more complicated .",
    "grsel and tinto solved the problem for three noisy interferometers using a maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "this solution required the measurement of the time delay of the signal between widely separated detectors to triangulate the direction of the source .",
    "zhou and michelson showed that the inverse problem for a spherical antenna can be solved in the presence of noise , also using a maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "what is disappointing about the maximum likelihood method is that the original simplicity of dhurandhar and tinto s noiseless solution is lost .",
    "in addition , an exact solution for the spherical detector was not found , making it necessary to solve the problem numerically .",
    "this solution can be computationally expensive , especially if the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low . for the three interferometer case , the numerical solution often can lead to an incorrect estimate at low snr @xcite .",
    "this appears not to be a problem for a spherical antenna ; a global maximum usually exists and is aligned with the correct direction .",
    "this leads us to believe that the problem for a spherical antenna can be solved analytically .    on experiments with",
    "the room - temperature prototype spherical antenna ( tiga ) at louisiana state university , we used a procedure to solve the inverse problem for impulsive excitations applied to the sphere surface @xcite .",
    "this solution was similar to dhurandhar and tinto s original solution for gravitational waves , but we used a perturbation argument ( presented below ) to take into account the finite snr of the experiment .",
    "the case of an impulsive excitation is more simple than a gravity wave because fewer parameters are involved , however , we show below that this method also can be used to find an analytic solution for gravitational waves .",
    "we begin by reviewing the response of a spherical antenna to gravitational waves in general relativity and show how dhurandhar and tinto s original method can be applied to solve for the wave direction and polarization amplitudes .",
    "we then generalize the arguments to any symmetric metric theory of gravity as well as to impulsive excitations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noisy ] we show how this technique can be extended to a noisy antenna with independent and equally sensitive detector outputs .",
    "this solution is found to be equivalent to the maximum likelihood method under the same noise requirements .",
    "the general approach taken allow this solution to be easily adapted to other types of excitations with similar symmetry properties .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of the limitations of the solution and possible extensions of this method .",
    "dhurandhar and tinto solved the inverse problem for 5 bar antennas as well as 5 interferometers @xcite .",
    "others have used their method to solve the problem for a spherical antenna @xcite .",
    "their technique involves constructing a matrix , say @xmath1 , that describes the response of the detector to a gravitational wave .",
    "they found that in general relativity the eigenvector of @xmath1 with zero eigenvalue points in the propagation direction of the wave . in the following",
    "we will also use this concept , but will derive the equations in the context of linear algebra as this will lead us directly into the solution for the noisy antenna . for a more complete discussion of the response of an elastic sphere to gravitational waves",

    "for an ideal sphere they are all degenerate , having the same eigenfrequency , and are distinguished only by their angular dependence .",
    "the effective force @xmath27 that a gravitational wave will exert on a fundamental quadrupole mode  @xmath28 of the sphere is given by the overlap integral between the eigenfunctions of the sphere and the gravitational tidal force @xmath29 each spherical component of the gravitational field determines uniquely the effective force on the corresponding mode of the sphere and they are all identical in magnitude",
    ". we can interpret the effective force @xmath27 in each mode as the product of : the physical mass of the sphere @xmath30 , an effective length @xmath31 ( a fraction of the sphere radius ) , and the gravitational acceleration @xmath32 .",

    ", one has a direct measurement of the effective force on the sphere and thus the spherical amplitudes of the gravitational wave .",
    "the standard technique for doing so on resonant detectors is to position resonant transducers on the surface of the sphere that strongly couple to the quadrupole modes .",
    "a number of proposals have been made for the type and positions of the transducers @xcite .",
    "what all of these proposals have in common is that the outputs of the transducers are combined into `` mode channels '' @xmath35 that are constructed to have a one - to - one correspondence with the quadrupole modes of the sphere and thus the spherical amplitudes of the gravitational wave @xcite , @xmath36 the mode channels can be collected to form a `` detector response '' matrix @xmath37 that in the absence of noise is equal to the cartesian strain tensor @xmath38 in the lab frame @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath16 may be a constant or a function of time depending upon the situation . this rotation changes the polarization components of the tensor but not the wave direction relative to the lab frame .",
    "to calculate the rotation matrix @xmath42 we need to solve the general eigenvalue equation for the strain tensor @xmath44 since @xmath1 and @xmath41 are equal in the absence of noise we are free to substitute @xmath1 in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : wave_strain ] ) we see that in general relativity the eigenvector of @xmath41 with @xmath45 points in the propagation direction of the wave .",
    "the direction can be calculated from this eigenvector by recognizing that it corresponds to the last column vector of @xmath42 in eq .",

    "one measurement that can potentially rule out certain gravitational theories is the properties of gravitational waves @xcite , such as the speed of propagation and allowable polarization states .",

    "observer - dependent theories require prior knowledge of the polarization states of the wave before any estimate of the direction can be made .",
    "once these are known it should be straightforward to adapt the eigenvector technique to estimate the direction . in the case of an impulsive excitation ,",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the direction has an eigenvalue that is opposite in sign and greater in magnitude than the two other eigenvalues . converting the eigenvectors to a direction",
    "again comes from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eqn : beta ] ) .",
    "the eigenvector solution is very convenient in that the inverse problem is reduced to solving a trivial eigenvalue problem .",
    "the solution is computationally simple , making this technique very efficient for use in an automated data analysis system .",
    "this feature may be important if one considers using a large number of candidate gravitational wave events in a coincidence exchange between several detectors where the source direction is used as a criterion to veto excess coincidences .",
    "the main restrictions on the eigenvector solution is that the mode channels must be independent and the noise normally distributed with equal variance .",
    "these restrictions can ideally be satisfied for a number of transducer arrangements  @xcite .",
    "we found that the eigenvector solution corresponds exactly to the maximum likelihood method under these conditions .",
    "it may be possible to apply this solution when the noise is not gaussian or is different for each mode channel , however further research is necessary to verify this extension .    through a number of numerical simulations as well as examination of the work of others",
    "@xcite we found that the errors due to the noise on a direction estimation are independent of the source location and wave amplitude for a given snr .",
    "however , the estimation of the polarization amplitudes using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : h_p_ls ] ) and  ( [ eqn : h_x_ls ] ) lead to direction dependent uncertainties . for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : snr_alpha ] shows the variance on the polarization angle @xmath143 for a range of snr and several values of @xmath19 found from a monte carlo type simulation .",
    "notice that the variance increases for low values of @xmath19 .",
    "this realization is disturbing given that a spherical antenna is equally sensitive to waves from all directions and polarizations .",
    "one might consider using a different coordinate system to try to avoid the directions with very poor estimates of the two polarization amplitudes .",
    "for example , use the xyz - convention of the euler angles where the first and the last rotations are not the same .",
    "this actually will not solve our problem , but instead change the directions in the sky which lead to the poor estimates .",
    "if we transform back from this coordinate system to the y - convention we just reintroduce the errors and thus have gained nothing .",
    "this dependency on the source direction is not unique to a sphere , a network of bars or interferometers will also suffer from this problem @xcite .",
    "this leads us to believe that we are excluding a piece of information from our procedures .",
    "the solution may lie in using the information from the two other eigenvectors of the detector response . in the above derivations these eigenvectors",
    "were simply discarded , but they also contain information about the gravitational wave that may eliminate these direction dependent errors .",
    "this approach will be the topic of a future paper  @xcite .",
    "while there are a few limitations to the eigenvector solution , its simplicity makes it easily extendable to other types of excitations . as discussed above",
    ", impulsive excitations can be located using this technique . as a practical example",
    "we recall that this solution was successfully tested on experiments with the lsu prototype spherical antenna @xcite .",
    "this practical confirmation of its validity gives us the confidence that it can be implemented on a real spherical antenna searching for gravitational waves .",
