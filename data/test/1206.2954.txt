    "the qcd phase diagram is a topic which currently sees a lot of attention in experimental and theoretical work .",
    "a particularly interesting ( and rather unexplored ) part is the region at low temperatures and medium to high densities ( medium to high values of the chemical potential @xmath1 ) .",
    "while for large chemical potential exotic states of matter are conjectured , for small chemical potential and vanishing temperature one expects physics to be independent of @xmath1 : as long as the chemical potential is smaller than the mass of the state it couples to no excitations can be generated and physics must be independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this is an interesting non - perturbative effect which has come to be known as silver blaze problem @xcite .    in principle lattice qcd",
    "would be an adequate method to study such non - perturbative phenomena .",

    "this so called complex action problem is a common feature in many field theories at non - zero @xmath1 and has considerably held up the study of qcd and other systems at finite density . using new ideas such as worm algorithms @xcite , designed for updating systems with local constraints ,",
    "several interesting models at finite density were rewritten in terms of a flux representation where the complex action problem is avoided and worm - based monte carlo simulations are possible ( see , e.g. , @xcite for examples ) .",
    "this opens the possibility to explore the silver blaze phenomenon in an ab - initio lattice study .    in this article",
    "we analyze the silver blaze problem for a charged scalar @xmath0 field . for scalar fields a suitable flux representation @xcite",
    "can be found which avoids the complex action problem at finite @xmath1 and monte carlo simulations at high densities become possible .",
    "the model has been analyzed previously using the complex langevin approach and mean field techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we systematically study the transition at the end of the silver blaze region at zero temperature and attempt to follow the transition line for non - zero temperatures .",
    "this work sheds light on silver blaze type of phenomena and explores new strategies for overcoming the complex action problem in lattice calculations at finite density .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we present the flux representation and our observables . in section 3",
