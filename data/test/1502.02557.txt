    "motivated by the processing of large social networks , we consider the study of graph colouring in an on - line streaming manner . as we know , storing and analyzing a large social graph in main memory for a single computer is not always possible .",
    "if the graph exceeds the capacity of the main memory , it has to be swapped to external memory .",
    "furthermore , in some cases , the social network graph to be processed may not be entirely known in advance .",
    "social networks rarely provide their complete graphs to third parties due to privacy issues . instead , they make their graphs accessible via api .",
    "if an external application aims to analyze the entire graph , it has to employ a local neighbourhood discovery protocol similar to web crawlers .",
    "in such a case , the application incurs costs associated with accessing a vertex of the graph in the form of the network communication necessary for issuing the api call . both of the aforementioned problems make the traditional off - line analysis of social network graphs challenging and sometimes even infeasible .",
    "thus , there is renewed interest in analysing graphs on - line .    aside from their practical application , on - line",

    "the vertices of a graph are pre - assigned lists of colours , and the task is to properly colour the graph so that every vertex receives a colour from its list . in what follows ,",
    "we study the problem from a theoretical point of view and resolve several open questions on this subject .",

    "the _ choosability number _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath7 , is the minimum number @xmath8 such that @xmath0 has an @xmath3-colouring whenever @xmath3 assigns every vertex a list of size at least @xmath8 . for any @xmath9",

    "@xmath8-choosable_. the choosability number of a graphs is sometimes also called the _ list - chromatic number_.    the ( off - line ) list colouring problem  to decide whether a graph has an @xmath3-colouring  was introduced by vizing in 1976  @xcite .",
    "the choosability of graphs was investigated by erds , rubin and taylor  @xcite and later by many others .",
    "if @xmath3 assigns every vertex the same list of colours , the instance of the list colouring problem becomes an instance of the `` standard '' vertex colouring problem .",

    "voigt  @xcite showed in 1993 that the choosability number @xmath7 can be strictly larger than the chromatic number @xmath11 even for planar graphs .",
    "the list colouring problem was brought to the on - line setting independently by schauz  @xcite and zhu @xcite in 2009 .",

    "correct , attempts to correct mr .",
    "paint s mistakes . for this purpose",
    ", she has a finite number of so - called _ erasers _ assigned to every vertex .",
    "she can use an eraser to remove the colour @xmath12 from any subset of vertices which were coloured by mr .",
    "paint in this round .",
    "an eraser can be used only once . by doing so , the number of erasers available for the given vertex decreases .",
    "the game ends when the entire graph is properly coloured in which case mrs .",
    "correct wins , or when mrs .",
    "correct can not correct the colouring because she ran out of erasers for some vertex .",
    "in such a case , mr .",

    "paint has a winning strategy , i.e. , the graph is not @xmath3-paintable , however it has an ( off - line ) list colouring for any list assignment with lists of the respective sizes  ( see appendix  [ ap : winning - strategy ] ) .",

    "then , @xmath28 .    a step towards proving conjecture  [",
    "con : ohba - online ] was made by kozik , micek and zhu  @xcite , who showed that it holds for the graphs with independence number of at most  3 .",

    "such a graph is @xmath41-paintable .    if @xmath0 contains a vertex of degree @xmath99 , all the vertices in the graph form a wheel of size @xmath83 around this vertex .",
    "hence , the maximum independent set has size @xmath40 .",
    "so , in all subcases of case 4 , graph @xmath0 has independence at most @xmath40 and the claim holds , or it is the graph depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : ap - triangulation ] , which is @xmath41-paintable by degeneracy .",
    "one of the initially suggested motivations for investigating the list colouring problem on - line was analysing big graphs on a single server with limited memory . a large disadvantage of the game model of mr .  paint and mrs .",
    "correct is that it does not contribute to lowering the memory requirements . in this section ,",
    "we suggest and investigate alternate models for the list colouring problem .",
    "one could hope in eliminating the former requirement by giving a smart strategy for mrs .",
    "correct which will be `` good enough '' and yet will not require mrs .",
    "correct to know the entire graph .",
    "unfortunately , there is no hope in overcoming the latter obstacle .",
    "if a large number of vertices in the graph ( possibly all of them ) share a single colour in their lists , they may have to be all processed ( i.e. , loaded into the memory ) within a single round of the game at some point .",
    "moreover , there may be multiple colours shared among many vertices , so there may be multiple memory - expensive rounds within the game .",
    "an alternative to the `` classical '' game model for list colouring is what we call the _ true on - line list colouring model_. in this model , the adversary reveals vertices of a graph @xmath0 in a sequence @xmath100 where every vertex @xmath101 is revealed with a list of admissible colours @xmath102 and edges @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the on - line algorithm @xmath105 has to assign a colour @xmath106 to every vertex @xmath101 immediately when the vertex appears .",
    "additionally , it can re - assign a colour for any other vertex @xmath107 . at any given moment ,",
    "the colouring of the graph maintained by @xmath105 must be proper , i.e. , no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour .",
    "assigning a colour to a vertex ( both the initial assignment and re - colouring ) has an associated cost @xmath69 .",
    "the _ cost _ of @xmath105 on sequence @xmath108 , denoted by @xmath109 is the total number of colour assignments that @xmath105 performs in order to colour the graph .",
    "if @xmath0 does not have an @xmath3-colouring , we set the cost @xmath110 .",
    "the notion of cost in the true on - line list colouring model naturally captures the cost of executing an on - line algorithm : whenever a vertex needs to be coloured or re - coloured , it has to be loaded into memory .",
    "optimally , every vertex appears in the memory exactly once , i.e. , the algorithm will require no re - colourings .",
    "the following theorem shows that even though this model exhibits potential to reduce the memory traffic , it is not always the case .",
    "consider two disjoint paths @xmath56 and @xmath57 on @xmath111 vertices where each vertex @xmath112 is assigned a list @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the best deterministic on - line algorithm and let the colour assigned to vertex @xmath4 by @xmath105 be denoted by @xmath114 .",
    "a cruel adversary proceeds as follows .",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath57 have two ends , call them @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively , such that @xmath117 , the adversary reveals a vertex @xmath118 with list @xmath119 attached to @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "let the resulting path be denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "at this point , one of @xmath56 , @xmath57 has to be re - coloured , and the algorithm incurs cost @xmath120 . if there are no two ends with distinct colours , the adversary first reveals a vertex @xmath121 attached to one end of @xmath56 with list @xmath119 and then proceeds as in the previous case in order to join @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : construction ] ) .",
    "if the adversary constructed @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the same fashion ( inductively starting from isolated vertices ) , the on - line algorithm pays total cost @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 denote the sequences of revealing @xmath125 and @xmath57 respectively and @xmath126 is a constant dependent of the way of connecting @xmath56 and @xmath57 . applying the master theorem  @xcite , we obtain that @xmath127          at the beginning of the game , mrs .",
    "correct chooses @xmath74 to be coloured by mr .",
    "paint in the first round .",
    "so , mr .",
    "paint chooses set @xmath56 which includes @xmath74 and perhaps some additional vertices .",
    "note that by lemma  [ lem : connected ] , we can assume that @xmath130 $ ] is connected .",
    "correct leaves @xmath74 coloured , and uses an eraser for vertices in @xmath56 whose distance from @xmath74 is odd . when the coloured vertices are removed , @xmath0 falls apart into a forest of trees that can be rooted so that every non - leaf node has at least one eraser available ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strong](b ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that on such a graph , mrs .",
    "correct wins under the `` classical '' game model , and thus also under the strong game model .",
    "we considered the on - line graph list colouring problem under several models .",
    "we extended the previous results about paintability of planar graphs to some specific graph classes .",
    "we provided an inductive argument for @xmath40-paintability of series - parallel graphs . for future work",
    ", we would like to suggest extending the following two theorems to the on - line setting :          our strong game model stands somewhere in between off - line list colouring and the `` classical '' on - line model .",
    "we showed that the model differs from the `` classical '' game model , but we do not believe that it is equivalent to the list colouring problem off - line .",
    "it is known that traditional paintability is stronger than choosability . however , no example of a graph @xmath0 where @xmath131 is known ( see e.q .",
    "* question 4 ) ) .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , strong game paintability together with its relation to paintability and off - line choosability is very intriguing and worth further investigation .",
    "the fact the list colouring on - line differs from list colouring off - line can be justified for instance on the graph depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : schauz ] .",
    "consider an arbitrary list assignment that assigns every vertex except for @xmath132 a list of size @xmath39 , and vertex @xmath132 a list of size @xmath40 . as proved in  @xcite , the graph an ( off - line ) list colouring for any such @xmath3 .",
    "consider analogous assignment of erasers @xmath21 which assigns every vertex in @xmath0 except for @xmath132 one eraser .",
    "vertex @xmath132 receives two erasers .",
    "paint s winning strategy is as follows .",
    "he starts by colouring with the colour @xmath133 the vertices @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "now , mrs .",
    "correct has two options :    1 .   _",

    "correct chooses to use the only eraser of @xmath135 . _ mr .",
    "paint wins by assigning first the same colour to @xmath135 and @xmath132 , this way neutralizing one of the erasers of @xmath132 , and next assigning the same colour to the odd cycle @xmath141 where each vertex has only one eraser left ."
