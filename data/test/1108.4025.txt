    "in the range of masses @xmath8 , the most sensitive higgs search mode at the lhc and tevatron is @xmath9  @xcite",
    ". as there are two sources of missing energy , the invariant mass of the higgs can not be reconstructed .",
    "thus , any new physics with a @xmath7 final state , regardless of whether the leptons and missing energy came from @xmath10 bosons , will be picked up to some extent by higgs searches .",
    "this makes the @xmath7 mode particularly susceptible to ` higgs - fakes ' ",
    "non - higgs particles which get mistaken for the higgs .",
    "while there are many potential higgs - fakes , in this paper we focus on fake higgs signals from technicolor , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a techni - rho and @xmath2 is a techni - pion .",
    "techni - pion couplings to electrons and muons are usually negligible , however the coupling , and hence the branching ratio , of @xmath2 to @xmath13 can be large .",
    "a leptonic decay of the tau then gives us the @xmath14 signature necessary for posing as a higgs boson .",
    "the technicolor signal is controlled by a handful of parameters : @xmath15 govern the rate for @xmath16 production , while @xmath17 determines the fraction of @xmath18 final states .",
    "the technicolor higgs - fake is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , one ( or both ) of the leptons come from a @xmath4 rather than a @xmath10 and there are four invisible particles rather than two .",
    "this makes the @xmath19 signal qualitatively different from higgs impostors considered in the past  @xcite .",
    "second , when a techni - pion decays hadronically , the final state from @xmath20 is a @xmath10 and two jets .",
    "this final state has been the subject of much interest since the cdf collaboration reported an excess in @xmath21 of @xmath22  @xcite ( later updated to @xmath23 ) , and in ref  @xcite it was shown that , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , a technicolor @xmath20 explanation fits the excess quite well .    as we will show here , for the same range of parameters required to fit the cdf excess , the @xmath18 signal from the techni - pion + w channel can have a rate similar to an intermediate mass standard model ( sm ) @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the _ same _ ( non - higgs ) physics that leads to @xmath1 can also generate a @xmath18 signal that fakes a higgs ; given the sensitivity of tevatron and lhc searches , such an excess should be visible , either now or in the near future .",
    "this coincidence of signals is especially tantalizing given that both cms and atlas see a discrepancy between their observed and expected limits in the @xmath18 channel for @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the setup of this paper is the following : after giving an introduction to the interactions and states in technicolor in sec .  [",
    "sec : techni ] , we describe the cdf @xmath1 signal in sec .",
    "[ sec : wjj ] along with the technicolor parameters which fit the observed excess .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : higgspose ] we study the technicolor @xmath18 signal : its rate , its kinematics , and its dependence on model parameters .",
    "we also plot several important kinematic variables and compare with sm higgs signals . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] , we conclude .",
    "techni - pions and techni - rhos are common ingredients in theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "techni - pions are pseudo - scalar states , uneaten cousins of the longitudinally polarized @xmath28 ; they are present only if the chiral symmetry of the underlying degrees of freedom is big enough .",
    "being pseudo - goldstone bosons , techni - pions are typically the lightest states in the spectrum , and are expected to have small couplings to light fermions .",
    "techni - rhos are spin-1 resonances which couple strongly to ( longitudinally polarized ) @xmath28 and techni - pions , but have very weak couplings to sm fermions .",
    "both techni - pions and techni - rhos lie in electroweak triplet representations .",
    "given their connection to electroweak symmetry breaking , the most natural mass for techni - resonances is @xmath29 , far too heavy to be produced with sizable rate at the tevatron .",
    "one class of models with lighter techni - resonances , and thus a larger rate , are ` multi - scale ' technicolor models  @xcite , where there is more than one ( presumably dynamical ) source of electroweak breaking . in the simplest version , there are two scales ( or vacuum expectation values ) , @xmath30 .",
    "the sum in quadrature of the two scales is fixed to the weak scale , but the ratio of the vacuum expectation values is a free parameter .",
    "resonances associated with the lighter scale are not only light , but their couplings to sm fermions are also suppressed  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a sm electroweak gauge coupling . provided @xmath34 , resonances as light as @xmath35 are allowed by all lep , tevatron , and lhc data . while resonance - fermion couplings are small in these scenarios , the resonance-@xmath2 couplings are large ; as the physical ( uneaten ) combination of @xmath2 in a multi - scale model reside primarily in the sector with the smaller contribution to ewsb , the @xmath2 couple more strongly to the lower - scale resonances .",
    "a two - scale technicolor setup was invoked in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the @xmath22 excess in @xmath1 events observed by the cdf collaboration in @xmath36 of data  @xcite the significance grew to @xmath23 .",
    "the update , many cross - checks , and several kinematic distributions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . in the cdf signal data ,",
    "the invariant mass of the dijets , after subtracting the large @xmath37 background , forms a peak centered at @xmath38 . assuming the extra events come from new physics , and assuming the signal acceptance is similar to @xmath39 , the cross section attributed to this excess is @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the d  collaboration explored the same final state using identical cuts in ref .",
    "@xcite , setting a limit on the allowed new physics cross section of @xmath41 , consistent with no excess .",
    "while the cuts are the same in both collaborations , the treatment of systematics and , in particular , the jet - energy correction are quite different  @xcite . given the large background that must be subtracted to see the signal , all of these subtle differences must be examined carefully ) analysis , which would ameliorate the differences in jet definition between collaborations ] .",
    "the lhc will eventually weigh in on this issue .",
    "however , with the current amount of integrated luminosity , atlas / cms are not yet sensitive to weakly coupled , @xmath42 initiated processes such as techi - rho production  @xcite .    to fit the cdf data , in ref .",
    "@xcite the parameters @xmath43 were used .",
    "not only does the @xmath1 rate for this parameter set match the excess observed by cdf , but the signal changes with respect to the background as cuts are varied in exactly the way the technicolor model predicts  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies of the kinematic distributions of the cdf excess are consistent with technicolor expectations  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the dijet @xmath44 distribution has a sharp turn on at @xmath45 and the @xmath46 of the dijet system falls to zero above @xmath47  @xcite . both of these features are expected in a two - resonance topology , where the total energy in the @xmath48 dijet system is limited by parent resonance mass and @xmath49 features occur depends sensitively on the mass difference between the parent and daughter resonances ] .",
    "another interesting aspect of the parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the techni - rho mass is less than twice the techni - pion mass .",
    "this choice kinematically suppresses the @xmath50 decay mode , leaving @xmath51 as the dominant mode .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath51 mode , along with the small width it induces , are the keys to a large technicolor rate into @xmath52 .",
    "while the point @xmath53 was chosen for calculations in  @xcite , the actual range of masses which fit the signal is broader , approximately @xmath54 . as the @xmath12 is taken lighter , the @xmath55 rate increases .",
    "however , an increasing cross section can be counteracted by decreasing the @xmath56 splitting ; as the available kinetic energy for the @xmath57 system shrinks , the @xmath58 cut imposed by cdf  @xcite removes more and more of the @xmath1 signal .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the flavor of the jets coming from charged @xmath2 was left ambiguous . naively , techni - pions couple to sm fermions proportional to their mass . with the techni - pion mass less than the top mass",
    ", @xmath59 is an obvious choice for the dominant mode .",
    "however , the flavor structure of the techni - pion - sm fermion coupling is model dependent , so inter - generation decays can be accompanied by ckm - like mixing factors . taking this mixing as an input parameter , we can freely dial the branching fraction of @xmath2 to bottom quarks .",
    "if decays to bottom + @xmath60 are highly suppressed , the most massive fermion to decay into is the @xmath4 .",
    "if the @xmath2 decays appreciably to @xmath13 , the rate for @xmath1 suffers , however , the @xmath4 modes are essential for faking a higgs signal .    charged techni - pion decays are not the only way to get dilepton states from technicolor . as the @xmath61 mode is kinematically allowed and is not an inter - generation decay , it is not expected to be suppressed with mixing angles so we will leave the @xmath62 branching fractions unchanged . while @xmath63 is the dominant decay mode , @xmath64 is not negligible ( @xmath65 ) and can still lead to @xmath66 final states  either from both taus decaying leptonically or one leptonic tau plus a lepton from the accompanying @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xmath66 events from @xmath67 decays usually contain extra jets , and higgs searches often include a jet veto to remove top - quark background . under a jet veto ,",
    "only the fraction of @xmath68 events where all jets are too soft or fall outside the detector acceptance will actually survive .",
    "in this section we will show how related decay modes of the @xmath2 can lead to a higgs - fake @xmath18 signal and explore the rates and kinematics of such signals . an example feynman diagram for the higgs - faking processes we have in mind",
    "is shown below in figure  [ fig : llnunu ] .    to generate a dilepton + @xmath69 final state from the technicolor scenario",
    ", we must pay the price of @xmath70 and the @xmath71% leptonic branching fraction of the tau .",
    "additionally , the higgs - fake events must pass selection cuts .",
    "on top of basic identification and kinematic cuts , @xmath18 higgs searches impose low dilepton invariant mass , substantial dilepton @xmath46 and a small azimuthal separation between leptons  @xcite .",
    "the first two cuts are imposed to remove background events containing @xmath72 bosons , while the third cut takes advantage of the fact that the two leptons in the ( higgs ) signal originate in a spin-0 resonance .",
    "while the technicolor fake signal has no @xmath72 , the mass of the mother resonance ( @xmath73 ) is considerably higher than that of an intermediate - mass higgs , which raises the @xmath74 distribution to higher values .",
    "the techni - signal also has a different correlation among leptons than a higgs , so the efficiency for the @xmath75 cut can be quite different .    to study the relative efficiencies under higgs cuts , we rely on monte carlo .",
    "technicolor events are generated using pythia6.4  @xcite , while comparison samples of @xmath26 events are generated at matrix - element level with madgraph5  @xcite , then passed through pythia for showering and hadronization .",
    "post - pythia , isolated leptons and photons are identified and removed from the list of final particles of all particles within a radius of @xmath76 of the lepton is less that @xmath77 . ] .",
    "the remaining particles are granularized into @xmath78 cells in @xmath79 space , with the energy of each cell rescaled such that it is massless .",
    "all cells with energy greater than @xmath80 are then clustered into jets using the anti-@xmath81 algorithm via fastjet  @xcite .",
    "once all physics objects have been identified , we apply the ( below - threshold ) higgs search cuts  @xcite .",
    "the basic cuts are the following : two leptons @xmath82 and @xmath83 for same - flavor lepton pairs . on top of the basic cuts , topological cuts @xmath84",
    "are applied cuts , in our simulations we vary the cuts with lepton flavor as dictated by ref .  @xcite . ] .",
    "finally , events are binned by jet multiplicity ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we will focus on the zero - jet bin , which has the best sensitivity .",
    "to get an idea for how the @xmath74 and @xmath86 cuts effect the technicolor and sm higgs signals differently , we plot the shapes of these distributions below in fig .  [",
    "fig : distributions ] .",
    "the plots show two different technicolor benchmark ( @xmath87 points , as well as two different sm higgs masses @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "+    the technicolor signal clearly has a different shape than a sm higgs , peaking at higher @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the technicolor rates would certainly grow if the @xmath90 cuts were loosened , however , a larger acceptance can be compensated for by taking a smaller @xmath91 .                    after imposing the @xmath92 cuts ,",
    "the final cross sections for the two technicolor mass points are tabulated below in table  [ table : comparison ] and compared with the two sm higgs masses used in figure .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] .",
    "as we are seeking to link the cdf @xmath93 excess with a possible @xmath18 excess , in table  [ table : comparison ] we also present the cross sections ( at the tevatron ) for the technicolor points after imposing the @xmath1 cuts from ref .",
    "@xcite . also , for each technicolor point we present two cross sections ; the first number uses @xmath94  the pythia default inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite which assumes no suppression of the @xmath95 or @xmath96 modes , while the second number uses @xmath97 , the result of shutting off all inter - generational @xmath2 decays .",
    "these two numbers demonstrate how the technicolor rates depend on the branching fraction of the charged @xmath2 to @xmath98 .",
    "all technicolor cross sections include a @xmath99-factor of @xmath100  @xcite to account for nlo effects , and we have scaled the sm higgs cross sections to match the nlo values computed with mcfm  @xcite .",
    ".cross sections , after all branching fractions and cuts .",
    "the second column shows @xmath101 at the lhc , while the third column shows @xmath102 at the tevatron . for the technicolor benchmarks",
    ", the first row assumes @xmath103 ( pythia default ) , while the second row assumes inter - generational @xmath104 decays are impossible and hence @xmath105 .",
    "the technicolor cross sections include both @xmath106 and @xmath107 production . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     no jet / lepton smearing or detector inefficiencies",
    "have been taken into account in these simulations .",
    "while these detector effects will influence the total rates , they will effect higgs and technicolor impostor signals in the same way , so the relative rates in the second column of table  [ table : comparison ] will remain unchanged . note that , while the branching fraction for @xmath104 changes by a factor of @xmath108 between the two rows ( in each technicolor point ) , the actual changes in the @xmath18 rates are less drastic . the mismatch occurs because the rows differ only in the charged @xmath2 contribution to @xmath18 while the @xmath62 contribution is held fixed .    for the technicolor parameter point used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rates in @xmath18 are smaller than the rate for either sm higgs values regardless of the @xmath104 branching fraction to taus .",
    "the technicolor @xmath18 signal in this case would look like a ( non - sm ) higgs with decreased couplings .",
    "for the lighter mass technicolor point , the @xmath18 rate is much closer to the sm higgs rate . depending on @xmath109",
    ", the rate can even be larger than a sm higgs of mass @xmath110 . to determine whether a technicolor point fits the cdf @xmath1 , recall that the excess consisted of @xmath111 events in @xmath36 of luminosity  @xcite .",
    "looking at the third column , we can see that the lighter technicolor point is still quite compatible .",
    "to further illustrate how the technicolor higgs - fake signal would look compared to a sm higgs , we plot some of the important distributions , below in figures  [ fig : mh150_compare ] , [ fig : mh130_compare ] . in these comparison plots ,",
    "the technicolor signal is stacked on top of sm backgrounds that has been generated using alpgenv214  @xcite and pythia .",
    "the dominant background is @xmath112 , with small contributions from other diboson processes and @xmath113 .",
    "the signal + background distributions we plot are the same as can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite : i. ) @xmath74 after all basic cuts and the @xmath114 cut , ii . )",
    "@xmath75 after basic cuts , the @xmath114 and @xmath74 cuts , iii . ) the total @xmath18 transverse mass @xmath115 after all cuts , where @xmath115 is defined as    @xmath116    for leptons coming from a sm higgs , this distribution has a jacobian edge at @xmath117 , while the technicolor distribution is much wider .",
    "detector effects will smooth out the edge in the higgs @xmath115 distribution , but the shape will remain different than we get from technicolor .",
    "in figures  [ fig : mh150_compare ] , [ fig : mh130_compare ] we use the lighter technicolor point throughout and assume the maximum @xmath104 branching fraction to tau . in the first ( second ) row of plots the technicolor signal is compared with a @xmath89 @xmath118 sm higgs . while there are some differences between the technicolor higgs - fake signal and a genuine higgs signal , the differences disappear as more cuts are applied . after all selection and topological cuts , the technicolor higgs - fake is nearly indistinguishable from a @xmath110 sm higgs , especially with the currently available statistics .",
    "while linking two excess is obviously the most exciting outcome , our result is interesting even if one of these excesses disappears with more data .",
    "the lack of a @xmath18 signal is informative because it imposes an upper limit on the branching fraction of the @xmath104 to @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , if the @xmath1 excess disappears we are free to consider a wider range of technicolor parameters for higgs - fake signals . finally ,",
    "while we have focused on a technicolor explanation of both the @xmath1 excess and a potential @xmath18 signal , two - higgs - doublet - motivated scenarios for @xmath1 , such as  @xcite can also generate higgs fakes via @xmath119 .",
    "note that two - higgs doublet scenarios also contain a real @xmath120 signal , and the interplay of the real and fake higgs signals would be interesting to study .",
    "we have shown that the same dynamics behind cdf s @xmath1 excess , namely low - scale technicolor , @xmath18 final states of the same order of magnitude as an intermediate mass sm higgs . in low - scale technicolor ,",
    "the @xmath18 final states come from @xmath121 , where the @xmath2 decays to @xmath122 .",
    "the rate for this process is sensitive to the branching fraction of techni - pions to tau states , which in turn depends on the details of how techni - pions and sm fermions interact .",
    "varying the charged techni - pion branching fraction to @xmath123 over a reasonable range and using techni - rho and techni - pion masses consistent with the @xmath1 excess , we find the @xmath18 rate indeed spans the same region as a @xmath124 sm higgs .",
    "we find a @xmath1 rate consistent with the cdf excess and good overlap between the technicolor and sm higgs @xmath18 rates requires a slightly lighter set of technicolor masses than considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and a large @xmath70 . for the lighter technicolor point",
    ", the higgs - fake signal also has similarly shaped kinematic distributions to a sm higgs , especially after tight selection and topological cuts are applied . with looser cuts",
    ", the differences between a fake and genuine higgs would be more evident , though perhaps difficult to dig out of larger backgrounds .",
    "it would also be interesting to study how higgs fakes such as technicolor appear when processed through multivariate techniques that are tuned and trained on sm higgs - like events .",
    "more generally , we introduce a new type of higgs impostor .",
    "this impostor is specific to the @xmath18 search mode , and is novel in that ( at least ) one of the leptons comes from a @xmath4 decay rather than from a @xmath10 .",
    "the existence of channel - specific higgs fakes emphasizes that , to verify an excess is indeed the sm higgs boson , multiple discovery modes must be checked .",
    "for example , for the technicolor higgs fake discussed here , there should be no signal in either the @xmath125 or @xmath126 channels .",
