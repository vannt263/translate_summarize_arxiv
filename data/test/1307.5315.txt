    "thus , in analogy with the above abelian case , we may understand the orange slice nature of @xmath94 as a rotation of the complex @xmath99-plane around some fixed subspaces .",

    "the realizations and their read - out require interactions that can simultaneously be turned on and off in a controlled way .",
    "the present work suggests an alternative way to reach closed paths in the grassmannian @xmath89 , which is the main ingredient in achieving universal holonomic quantum gates proposed in @xcite to perform fault tolerant quantum information processing .",

    "@xcite in that the orange slice shaped loops are accomplished by applying sequentially two different pulses while the loops in ref .",
    "@xcite are results of single pulses .",
    "the orange slice technique has the advantage that it allows for arbitrary su(2 ) holonomic transformations in a single - loop scenario , while the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite can achieve this only by combining at least two loops .",
    "it is important that different approaches and schemes for holonomic quantum computation be thoroughly explored and compared with one another .",
