    "in particular , the lagrangian action calculations and subsequent determination of the phase structure are presented in their entirety here .    in section  [ sec : emads ] , we present an ansatz for obtaining the einstein  maxwell truncation of gauged ads supergravity with appropriate compactifications of @xmath15 supergravity on @xmath16 , and @xmath17 type iib supergravity on @xmath18 . in the planar or infinite  volume limit , the charged black holes in einstein  maxwell  anti ",

    " theory contexts@xcite .",
    "hence , in other dimensions beyond @xmath13 and 5 , we expect that there is a dual theory .",
    "in particular , for em ",
    "the dual field theory is probably a close cousin of the m5brane theory .",
    "the dual field theories have their supersymmetry ( if they had any to start with ) broken due to coupling to a global background @xmath22 current ( as well as turning on a non  zero temperature ) .",

    "the electromagnetic charge carried by the black holes is in the same @xmath22 of corresponding @xmath23 gauge group .",
    "we find very interesting phase structures at intermediate temperatures ( in finite field theory volume ) , as a result of studying two complementary thermodynamic ensembles : we study thermodynamic ensembles with fixed background potential in which case the background is ads with a constant fixed potential and we also study a fixed localized charge ensemble , for which the background is an extremal black hole with that charge .    in all cases , at sufficiently high temperature the physics",
    "is dominated by highly non  extreme black holes , and we therefore recover the `` unconfined '' behaviour characteristic of the associated field theories@xcite .",
    "the finite horizon size of the black holes controls the behaviour of the expectation value of spatial wilson lines accordingly , yielding the area law behaviour , as follows from ref.@xcite .    at intermediate temperatures , in the fixed charge ensemble",
    ", the presence of charge allows a new branch of black hole solutions to modify the qualitative phase structure in the low charge regime , resulting in a very interesting phase structure about which we will have more to say later in this section .    intriguingly , as there is an extremal but non  supersymmetric black hole with non",
    " zero entropy even at zero temperature , we must conclude something interesting about the field theory in the presence of the global background @xmath22 current : there must still be at @xmath24 a large number of states ( with the given charge ) available to the field theory in order to generate this entropy .",
    "for the case where we hold the potential ( _ i.e. , _ _ not _ the charge ) fixed , we do not expect that this is the ground state , because the extremal black hole can decay into kaluza ",
    "klein particles , leaving ads .",
    "this is because the extremal black hole is not supersymmetric .",
    "this subtlety does not arise in the standard gibbons  hawking calculus of the thermodynamics of black holes which we use here because the calculations are not sensitive to the ability of the black holes to emit charged particles .    that the extremal black hole can decay by emitting charged kaluza ",
    "klein particles here follows from the fact that the charge descends from rotation in higher dimensions .",
    "there are well  known classical processes for reducing the rotation of objects like black holes by scattering@xcite , and therefore in the context of quantum field theory , one has the analogous processes of emission in superradiant modes@xcite .",
    "the same superradiant emission was considered in the context of charged black holes in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus one should expect the extremal black hole in the emads truncation to decay _ via _ such supperradiant emission .",
    "of course , the usual thermal hawking radiation may also tend to discharge nonextremal black holes@xcite . in the fixed potential ensemble , as the charge of the black hole is allowed to fluctuate while it is in contact with the thermal reservoir , superradiant and hawking emission processes can occur to reduce the charge of the black hole , allowing it to decay back to ads ( plus charge ) .",
    "however , in the fixed charge thermodynamic ensemble ( with varying potential ) , the extremal black hole is expected to be the long  lived state at zero temperature .    translating the formula for the entropy to the field theory we find , for example , that the four dimensional yang  mills theory ( in the presence of the global background @xmath22 current )",
    "has a zero  temperature entropy which goes like @xmath25 for large black holes , where @xmath26 measures the total charge in units of the minimal charge of kaluza ",
    "klein excitations ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath27 ) , and is proportional to the volume , @xmath28 , of the field theory . notice that the result for the four dimensional field theory is consistent with confinement at @xmath24 , as the result is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "confinement also follows from the fact that at @xmath24 , the euclidean section of the solution has no bolt , and therefore temporal wilson lines will always be homotopic to zero , and therefore have zero expectation value . meanwhile",
    ", spatial wilson lines can not interact with the horizon to produce an area law dependence , because at extremality the horizon recedes infinitely far away down a bertotti  robinson throat .",
    "the phase structure which we obtain in each thermodynamic ensemble is summarized in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "0.5 cm 2.0 cm    the astute reader will recognize the figure on the right as the classic phase diagram of the liquid  gas system ! to translate , our @xmath29 is like the temperature @xmath30 of the fluid while @xmath31 is like the pressure @xmath32 .",
    "the non  extreme black holes of type ( 1 ) ( `` small '' ) and ( 3 ) ( `` large '' ) ( see section  [ sec : action ] and [ sec : thermo ] for explanation ) are like the liquid phase and the gaseous phase , respectively . the critical line ( `` vapour pressure curve '' )",
    "represents the place at which a first order phase transition between the liquid and gas occurs .",
    "as is well known , there is a critical temperature at which the vapour pressure curve terminates , representing the fact that above a critical temperature , one can convert a liquid to a gas continuously .",
    "this translates here into a critical charge above which the two types of black hole can be continuously converted into one another with no discontinuity in their size .    that this system ( first modeled by van der waals@xcite , with a crucial modification by maxwell ) appears in this ads black hole thermodynamics is fascinating , and",
    "would not have been possible ( at least in this way ) without the presence of the extra branches of solutions which appear when there is negative cosmological constant .",
    "we discuss this further in sections  [ sec : thermo ] and  [ sec : action ] .",
    "further fascination may be found in the fact that the explicit shape of the free energy surface ( as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) is that of the classic `` swallowtail '' catastrophe , familiar from the study of bifurcations@xcite .",
    "the control surface of the `` cusp '' catastrophe also appears , which ( of course ) follows from the well known fact that it is the shape of the van der waals equation of state , viewed as a surface in @xmath33 space .    that these shapes appear in this context",
    "suggests that there is some exciting universality to be explored here : catastrophe theory is largely a classification of the possible distinct types of bifurcation shapes that can occur in a wide variety of complex systems .",
    "this classification ( which , for the common `` elementary '' cases is of a ",
    "e type ) is equivalent to the ( perhaps more familiar ) classfication of singularities@xcite . it is of considerable interest to discover just what circumstances might give rise to the other members of the classification .",
    "recalling that this all translates _ via _ holography into properties of a dual field theory , we would learn a great deal about universal phase structures which can occur there also .",
    "physics near the horizon of supergravity branes can be described in terms of spontaneous compactification of supergravity . in the case of",
    "non  dilatonic branes which will be the focus of the paper when the compactification takes place on a _ round _ @xmath4sphere the low energy degrees of freedom are described by an effective theory of einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant coupled to @xmath23 gauge fields . the schwarzschild  anti  desitter black hole solutions of this theory have been used in the context of the ads / cft correspondence to infer thermal properties of the dual field theories  @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this program is to study ads black holes which are charged under a subgroup of the gauge symmetry of the gauged supergravity .",
    "solutions of einstein  maxwell  anti ",
    "desitter in some dimensions are known , but in the context of string / m  theory , it is also interesting to determine how to make a truncation of the type  iib supergravity , or of 11 dimensional supergravity , which gives the emads effective action . in other words , we must make certain higher  dimensional choices which will result in the removal of the generic coupling of the @xmath34 term to scalars resulting from the kaluza  klein reduction .    amusingly , one simple way to introduce ( gauge ) charge on the black holes is by simply spinning or twisting the transverse ( angular ) sphere that becomes the compact space .",

    "we return to the familiar two branch situation of schwarzschild , while for large charge , we have a situation analogous to that seen for the large fixed potential .",

    "it is shown in figure  [ freeplot1 ] .    -.5",
    "cm    the interpretation of this is as follows . at any non  zero temperature , for large potential ( @xmath152 ) the charged black hole is thermodynamically preferred , as its free energy ( relative to the background of ads with a fixed potential ) is strictly negative for all temperatures .",
    "this behaviour differs sharply from the small potential ( @xmath117 ) situation , which is qualitatively the same as the uncharged case : in that situation , in finite volume , the free energy is positive for some range @xmath153 , and it is only above @xmath154 that the thermodynamics is dominated by schwarzschild black holes ( the larger , stable branch ) , after their free energy is negative .",
    "( see the center graphs in figure  [ freeplot1 ] . )",
    "so for high enough temperature in all cases the physics is dominated by non ",
    "extremal black holes . in this case , ( after converting gravitational to field theory quantities , @xmath155 and @xmath156 ; for @xmath145 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 ; for @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 . ] ) the free energy and entropy behave at ultra  high temperature as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the @xmath67dimensional spatial volume upon which the field theory lives .",

    "the resulting power of @xmath7 shows how the number of unconfined degrees of freedom of the theory goes with @xmath7 , by analogy with the case of @xmath145 where @xmath168 counts the dependence on the number of degrees of freedom on @xmath7 for an @xmath8 gauge theory .    at low temperatures , and for @xmath152",
    ", we have something very new .",
    "notice that as we go to @xmath24 , the free energy curve approaches a maximum value which is less than zero .",
    "this implies that even at zero temperature the thermodynamic ensemble is dominated by a black hole . from the temperature curve  ( [ betaplot3 ] ) it is clear that it is the extremal black hole , with radius @xmath169 . for @xmath170 , at @xmath24",
    "we recover ads space .",
    "so this suggests that even at zero temperature the system prefers to be in a state with non ",
    "zero entropy ( given by the area of the black hole ) .",
    "notice that this @xmath24 situation displays the `` confined '' behaviour characteristic of the ordinary conformally invariant zero  temperature phase , despite the presence of the black hole .",
    "this follows from the fact that the temporal wilson lines will still have zero expectation value , as the fundamental strings which define them can not wind the horizon which has infinite period at zero temperature .",
    "similarly , spatial wilson lines will not display the area law behaviour , because the fundamental string world ",
    "sheets can not be obstructed by the horizon , because at extremality , it is infinitely far away down a throat .",
    "having pointed out this intriguing possible zero temperature behaviour , we expect that for the case of _ fixed potential _ considered here , this is not the complete story .",
    "we must allow for the possibility that the extremal black hole might decay due to processes involving kaluza ",
    "klein particles charged under the @xmath22 .",
    "( see the discussion near the end of section  i. ) this possibility can not be discounted because the extremal black hole is not supersymmetric , as pointed out before , and therefore not guaranteed to be stable by the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "we expect that calculations which include the effects of charge emission will shift the free energy back to zero , representing the true , equilibrium situation .",
    "alternatively if we consider the action ( [ actionjackson ] ) on its own merit outside of string or m  theory compactifications , it may be regarded as part of a theory without fundamental charged particles .",
    "the resulting thermodynamic phase structure for the fixed potential ensemble is summarized in the left diagram of figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "we have seen that we may consider a @xmath24 background containing an extremal black hole of charge @xmath29 .",
    "let us now keep this charge fixed and allow the potential at infinity to vary .",
    "this is the canonical ensemble , and the corresponding thermodynamic potential , the free energy , is @xmath171 the energy , entropy and electric potential are computed as @xmath172 in this case @xmath173 measures the energy above the ground state , which is the extremal black hole .",
    "together , they satisfy the first law , which in this case should be written as @xmath174 .",
    "the free energy as a function of temperature is shown below for the cases of small and large charge , respectively ( compare to the third graph in figure  ( [ freeplot1 ] ) for the uncharged case ) .    -0.5",
    "cm    that there are three branches for the small charge case follows from the second graph in figure  [ betaplot1 ] , which is magnified and labeled in fig",
    ".  [ freeplot3 ] , on the right .",
    "from there , it is clear that for low temperature there can only be one solution ( `` branch 1 '' ) for the black hole radius .",
    "at some temperature @xmath175 , the origin of two new branches ( `` branches 2 and 3 '' ) of solutions appears ( @xmath176 for the chosen parameters in the plot . ) .",
    "above this temperature ( below @xmath177 ) , there are therefore three distinct branches of solution until at temperature @xmath178 , ( @xmath179 in the plot ) two of the branches ( 1 and 2 ) coalesce and disappear , leaving again only a single branch ( 3 ) , which persists for all higher temperatures .",
    "returning to the free energy plot , the meaning is now clear .",
    "starting to the extreme left of the plot , ( low temperature ) we see that there is a single branch of free energy , corresponding to the branch 1 solutions . at @xmath180",
    ", branches 2 and 3 appear on the graph and separate from each other at higher temperatures . at @xmath181 , branches 1 and 2 coalesce and disappear , while branch 3 persists for all higher temperatures , continuing to the left .",
    "so from zero temperature the negative free energy of branch  1 means that those non  extreme black holes dominate the thermodynamic ensemble . at temperature @xmath154 , ( @xmath182 in the plot )",
    "the free energy of branch 3 is actually more negative than that of branch  1 , and so that branch of non  extremal black holes takes over the physics and continue to do so for all higher temperatures .",
    "the situation at @xmath154 is a genuine finite temperature phase transition , of first order .",
    "( notice from the first graph in figure  [ freeplot3 ] that the free energy is continuous , but its first derivative is discontinuous . )",
    "this results from the jump ( along the dotted line in the final graph in figure  [ freeplot3 ] ) from branch 1 to branch 2 , from small to large @xmath78 black holes , as the temperature increases . as the entropy is proportional to @xmath183",
    ", there is a jump in the entropy , or a release of `` latent heat '' .",
    "as we approach the critical value , @xmath136 , of the charge representing the crossover into the large charge regime , the kink in the free energy and therefore the transition vanishes , as branches 1 and 3 merge ( and branch 2 disappears ) . the difference in horizon radii between the two branches , @xmath184 , may be thought of as an order parameter for the transition , as it vanishes above @xmath136 , where the transition goes away .    as noted before in the case of fixed potential ensemble , branches 2 and 3 are the exact analogues of the small and large schwarzschild black holes of hawking and page@xcite , or the small and large taub ",
    "bolts discovered in the thermodynamic studies of ref .  @xcite . in those papers , above a certain temperature @xmath180 , there were two allowed solutions at a given temperature , the smaller ( branch 2 ) being unstable and the larger ( branch 3 ) being stable , which persists to dominate the thermodynamics above some critical temperature @xmath154 .",
    "the existence of a stable branch 1 , and its merger with branch @xmath165 to disappear at @xmath181 is a new feature when we add a small fixed charge to the story .",
    "conversely , if we start from a situation where charge is present on the black hole but the cosmological constant vanishes , then we find branches 1 and 2 , and it is only when the negative cosmological constant is turned on that branch 3 appears .    for large charge , there is only a single branch allowed , ( see figure  [ freeplot3 ] , the cusps collide and disappear ) and the associated thermodynamic story is correspondingly simpler .",
    "the free energy shows that the non  extreme charged black holes dominate from @xmath24 .    in all cases ( large or small @xmath29 ) ,",
    "the ultra high temperature phases are dominated by a black hole and the free energy and entropy have the characteristic `` unconfined '' field theory behaviour shown in eqns .",
    "( [ behave ] ) .",
    "one might examine the approach to the critical point more closely .",
    "in particular , consider the behaviour of the specific heat @xmath185 with @xmath141 , as the temperature approaches the critical value , one finds a singularity with @xmath186 .",
    "this behavior may be contrasted with the @xmath187 singularity found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the essential difference is of course that near the critical point we have a point of inflection with @xmath188 , while ref.@xcite considers a minimum with @xmath189 .    the evolution of the free energy of the system as a function of charge is particularly interesting as one goes from zero charge to large charge .",
    "the single cusp of the uncharged ( schwarzschild ) system is joined by a second cusp which comes in from infinity , forming ( with the original one ) a section of the well known `` swallowtail '' shape , familiar as a bifurcation set or `` catastrophe '' in singularity or catastrophe theory .",
    "the significance of this is discussed in the next section .",
    "as we cross over into the large charge regime at some critical value of @xmath73 , the cusps merge and the free energy becomes a simple monotonic function . for completeness",
    ", we include a series of plots showing this evolution .",
    "( we do not put them on the same axes , as we did for the fixed potential case , for the sake of clarity . )",
    "-0.5 cm 0.5 cm -0.5 cm    the resulting thermodynamic phase structure for the fixed charge ensemble is summarized in the diagram on the right in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "we can not refrain from further general comments upon the meaning and structure of the curves that we have uncovered in the previous sections .",
    "although we plotted only the cases for the @xmath145 case , representing ads@xmath11 ( and hence four dimensional field theory ) , the same universal structures appear in the cases @xmath143 and 6 as well , giving the same pleasing phase structure for the fixed charge ensemble .    the phase structure that we uncovered for",
    "the fixed charge ensemble should remind the reader of the classic van der waals ",
    "maxwell behaviour , modeling the liquid  gas system .",
    "indeed , they are isomorphic .",
    "the @xmath121 curve ( the middle graph of figure  [ betaplot1 ] ) should recall the graph of the @xmath190 van der waals equation of state , where @xmath32 ( the pressure ) is replaced here by @xmath106 and @xmath191 ( volume ) by @xmath78 .",
    "the instability of branch 2 is then simply the familiar instability of the corresponding section of the van  der waals curve .",
    "the jump from branch  1 to branch  3 which we deduced from the form of the free energy is the precise analogue of the maxwell construction . in the isomorphism between our parameters and those of the van der waals ",
    "maxwell system , our charge @xmath29 is equivalent to their temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the instability of branch  2 in both languages makes intuitive sense : as one increases the pressure , the volume should _ decrease _ , and therefore the positively sloped branch is not stable .",
    "a similar statement holds for the black holes after making the translation to the current situation : for black holes in equilibrium with the heat bath , an increase in the temperature results in an increase in the black hole radius and hence mass , for stable black holes . notice that this also follows from the first law , recalling that the entropy is a positive power of the radius .",
    "so the positive slope branch of the @xmath121 curve is generally unstable .    in the language of catastrophe theory@xcite the study of jumps in some `` state variables '' as a result of smooth changes in `` control variables'' the physical solutions of the @xmath192 curve , viewed as a two dimensional surface in @xmath193 space ,",
    "is the `` control surface '' of the `` cusp catastrophe '' .",
    "the cusp shape is the union of points in the @xmath194 plane ( the control variables ) where the state variable ( the allowed value of @xmath78 ) jumps from branch  1 to branch  3 , as branch  2 is unstable . after applying the minimum free energy condition to determine the allowed branches ( the `` maxwell criterion '' )",
    ", the cusp catastrophe appears in the @xmath195 plane , ( or equivalently the @xmath196 plane ) collapsed to the critical line ( see figure  [ fig : phases ] ) ( or `` vapour pressure curve '' ) along which the two types of black hole can coexist , and across which there is a phase transition .",
    "the end of the line , at the critical value @xmath136 , where branch  2 disappears , is the point where the distinction between branch  1 and  3 goes away .",
    "the order parameter , @xmath197 for this critical point is the radius difference of the branches @xmath198 . beyond the critical charge",
    "there is no phase transition ( @xmath199 ) in going from branch  1 black holes to branch  3 by increasing the temperature .",
    "this is of course the familiar statement that above a critical temperature , there is no phase transition in going from a gas to a liquid by increase of pressure .",
    "intriguing is the fact that the two dimensional free energy surface @xmath200 forms the shape of the swallowtail catastrophe ( see figure  [ freeplots ] ) .",
    "( note that for @xmath201 and @xmath202 the shape is the same . )",
    "this naturally follows from the ability of the @xmath121 curve to produce three branches , and the resulting shape for the free energy curve is the union of three branches .    here",
    ", the swallowtail does not have the usual interpretation as a bifurcation surface ( like the cusp does above ) but it is natural to wonder whether its appearance tells us that there is some universality at work here .",
    "this is because the language of catastrophe theory is largely a classification of the possible distinct types of bifurcation shapes that can occur .",
    "this classification ( which , for the common `` elementary '' cases is of a ",
    "e type ) is equivalent to the ( perhaps more familiar ) classfication of singularities@xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether or not the inclusion of more control parameters will always result in a free energy curve of a shape ( and corresponding phase structure ) which falls into the classification . it would certainly be amusing to find yet another case of the a ",
    "e classification appearing in string and m  theory physics .",
    "the study of the thermodynamics of black holes in einstein  maxwell  anti  desitter is highly relevant to the thermodynamics of certain superconformal field theories with a background global current switched on .",
    "this follows from the logic of the ads / cft correspondence , and the fact that the emads system can arise as the near  horizon physics of rotating m2 and d3branes , and it should therefore be regarded as the effective theory of the strongly coupled field theory living on the rotating branes world  volume .",
    "the phase structures of the charged black hole systems studied here , and summarized in figure  [ fig : phases ] , are markedly different from those of the uncharged systems studied before in this context  @xcite .",
    "the addition of charge revealed a rich phase structure , with precise analogues to classic thermodynamic systems .",
    "the physics is consistent with a dual field theory interpretation .    in all cases ,",
    "the infinite volume limit can be found by taking the limits given in eqn .",
    "( [ scaled ] ) .",
    "this scaling may be applied to the expressions for the actions ( eqns .",
    "( [ actionone ] ) and  ( [ actiontwo ] ) ) and the period ( eqns .",
    "( [ betaform ] ) and ( [ betaformtwo ] ) ) . in all cases ,",
    "the result is that there is only one branch of black hole solutions ( like the large charge and potential situations had in finite volume ) , and the free energy is negative definite , showing that the thermodynamics is dominated by black holes for all temperatures .",
    "of course , this is what we should expect , from the field theory point of view .",
    "as we commented before , the gauge field in the ads space naturally couples to a cft current @xmath203 , following the prescription of ref .  @xcite . from the asymptotic variation of the gauge field  ( [ pure ] ) or its corresponding field strength , one then has an expectation value @xmath204 .",
    "thus one might think of the cft state as containing a plasma of ( globally ) charged quanta .",
    "the precise nature of the cft state depends on the ensemble , which we were studying . for the case of the fixed potential ,",
    "the dual statement is that a chemical potential conjugate to the global charge has been introduced leading to the expectation value .",
    "the fixed charge calculations correspond to an ensemble of cft states with a fixed global charge .",
    "thus the difference between the two calculations is analogous to that between the canonical ( fixed @xmath30 ) and microcanonical ( fixed @xmath173 ) ensembles .    in the context of d3 branes with @xmath145 , the @xmath51 gauge fields couple to the r  symmetry currents in the super ",
    "yang  mills theory .",
    "this aspect of the duality has been used to great advantage to produce nontrivial consistency tests by comparing correlators protected by supersymmetry@xcite .",
    "of course in the present case , with the truncation to emads theory , we are focussed on a particular diagonal @xmath22 generator of the @xmath51 symmetry .    in this context , we can translate the results of the supergravity calculations to quantitative statements about the strong coupling behavior of the super  yang  mills theory .",
    "up to numerical factors , we have as usual@xcite : @xmath205 and @xmath206 , ( where @xmath207 is the type  iib string coupling ) as well as @xmath208 .",
    "it remains fix how the black hole charge should be characterized in the cft .",
    "the most natural approach is to measure the physical charge  ( [ thecharge ] ) in terms of the fundamental charge of the kaluza ",
    "klein excitations in the ads space , _ i.e. _ , with @xmath209 . in the field theory",
    "then , @xmath210 ( where @xmath28 is the spatial volume of the field theory ) essentially counts the number of fundamentally charged quanta per unit volume in a given state . given this framework",
    ", we can consider the field theory content of our results .",
    "for example , one might wonder what the critical charge ( [ thecritics ] ) appearing in the fixed charge phase diagram corresponds to : @xmath211    in general , translating the entropy , mass or free energy to a field theory expression produces a complicated function of both the temperature @xmath30 and the charge @xmath26 .",
    "one relatively simple case is the high temperature limit , where the charge essentially plays no role ( see eqn .",
    "( [ behave ] ) ) .",
    "another interesting case to consider is that of the extremal black holes for which @xmath24 . by demanding that @xmath212 and @xmath213 have a consistent solution",
    ", one finds that the mass and charge parameters are related by the following expression : @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "a simple case to consider is that of a large black hole with @xmath217 , for which @xmath218 .",
    "further in this limit , one has that @xmath219 and so @xmath220 notice that implicitly here we are considering a regime where @xmath221 .",
    "the lack of dependence of the entropy on @xmath7 is a signal of confined behaviour at zero temperature , despite the presence of the black hole",
    ". it would certainly be interesting if this entropy result could be recovered by considering partitioning of the charge @xmath26 amongst the charged excitations of the cft .",
    "we have left aside the case of compactification of six dimensional supergravity on @xmath222 to get ads@xmath223 . by setting the @xmath222 in rotation in its two independent rotation planes , in a symmetric fashion",
    ", we get an electric potential in ads@xmath223 . doing so ,",
    "notice that if we start from the solution describing a rotating six dimensional black string ( such as the one obtained from the d1d5 bound state ) , then , in the throat limit the rotation of the @xmath222 can be undone by a diffeomorphism@xcite .",
    "in other words , the effective gauge field in three dimensions is pure gauge .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in ref.@xcite , there do exist charged black hole solutions in emads theory in three dimensions .",
    "these have an electric potential that diverges logarithmically at infinity , which prevents one from defining the ensemble at fixed potential . nevertheless ,",
    "if the extremal black hole background is subtracted , then the fixed charge ensemble can be appropriately defined . for non  rotating black holes ( in ref.@xcite , the full kerr ",
    "newman solution is constructed ) there is only one branch , just like we have found for large fixed charge ( see figure  [ betaplot1 ] , left ) , with corresponding simple thermodynamic structure given by figure  [ freeplot1 ] ( left ) .",
    "finally , it is also worth remarking that the close similarity that we have observed with familiar structures from equilibrium thermodynamics , and expectations from a dual field theory is further encouragement ( for those who need it ) that the quantum mechanics of black holes is not unlike that of other situations .",
