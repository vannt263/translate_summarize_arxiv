    "lif is a ionic solid that is particularly transparent to short wavelength radiation due to its large band gap and hence is commonly used in optics for high - pressure and temperature experiments , such as those related to the development of pulsed power @xcite .",

    "estimates of the transport properties of lif are important to both these applications .",
    "specifically , in dynamic high - pressure experiments , a lif window maintains the pressure at the sample interface where velocimetry measurements are typically made . due to the extreme conditions , the necessary transmission properties are difficult to measure directly . in these experiments , a shock or a near - shock ramp compression with pressures up to 800",
    "gpa @xcite is generated by a variety of means and the material response is measured using velocity interferometry , see , _ e.g. _ , refs",
    ".. there are many efforts concentrating on estimating the optical properties of lif crucial to this measurement , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .. due to the short but finite timescale of dynamic material experiments , the thermal conductivity of lif windows can significantly affect the temperature measured at the sample interface . in this work ,",
    "we focus on calculating this thermal conductivity at the extreme conditions relevant to these experiments with the goal of understanding the nonequilibrium energy transfer that governs their behavior .",
    "the material properties of lif have been explored in experiments and simulation primarily nearer to ambient conditions .",
    "for instance , thacher @xcite measured the sound velocity and thermal conductivity of lif at temperatures less than 100 k. at ambient pressure , [ thacher1967effect ] shows that the thermal conductivity of lif peaks at about 2 w / m - k near 20 k , where the quantum increase of heat capacity begins to be dominated by the decrease in conductivity due to umklapp scattering . andersson and bckstrm @xcite were able to measure the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of lif at room temperature up to pressures of 1 gpa .",
    "they showed a linear dependence of thermal conductivity on pressure and measured a conductivity value of 16.3 w / mk at 1 gpa .",
    "phase and other transitions can complicate measurements at higher temperatures and pressures .",
    "given that the full phase diagram for lif is not known , smirnov @xcite computed an _ ab initio _ phase diagram of lif over pressures ranging from 0 to 500 gpa and temperatures ranging from 0 to 12000 k together with the elastic properties and associated debye temperatures .",
    "smirov @xcite predicted that the structure of lif is the nacl - like arrangement b1 at low temperature and pressure but transitions to the cscl - like arrangement b2 at higher pressures and temperatures .",

    "they also make clear the distinction between thermal instability and melting especially for small systems at high pressures using a phase coexistence method . also using classical md , young",
    "@xcite studied ion damage of lif crystals .",
    "related to thermal properties of lif , nsslein and schrder @xcite calculated the dispersion and phonon density of states ( phdos ) via polarizable model of the inter - atomic interactions of lif at 0 k. dolling _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite also calculated the phdos of lif via lattice dynamics and compared it to dispersion data derived from slow neutron inelastic scattering . in their work , the crystal has phonon content up to 20 thz with most of the low frequency content attributed to the f ion .",
    "recently , stegailov @xcite calculated the phdos with density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation and showed the onset of mechanical instability , which may lead to defect formation or melting , due to hot electrons when the electron temperature reaches 37,000 k. following this body of work , in this paper we use md together with the green - kubo ( gk ) formalism @xcite to estimate the thermal conductivity of lif at stresses on par with the elastic moduli and temperatures in excess of the melt temperature at ambient conditions . in particular , we investigate both volumetric and uniaxial deformation modes similar to ( non - hugniot ) ramp compression experiments .",

    "given the findings in [ belonoshko2000born ] , it was evident that the md potential may not transition to the most stable phase with changes in pressure and temperature but instead becomes stuck in a metastable state .",
    "we used this fact together with a phase diagram independently calculated with dft to estimate thermal conductivity over pressures ranging from 100 to 400 gpa and temperatures ranging from 1000 to 4000 k. to compute the phase diagram , we follow smirnov s work @xcite and others @xcite and use plane augmented wave ( paw ) dft with the local density approximation ( lda ) instead of the linear muffin tin orbital method smirnov employed to estimate the zero temperature enthalpy and entropy of the phonon population . from a dynamical matrix calculated with dft , we are able to estimate the entropy component of the free energy with a quasi - harmonic model . the range of the free energy estimated with the quasi - harmonic model limited by the mechanical stability which we also estimated with the _ ab initio _ bond stiffnesses governing the phonon propagation .",

    "et al . _  @xcite using a different empirical potential and the experimental measurements : 15.7 w / mk at 0.1 gpa , 16.3 w / mk at 1.0 gpa , 300 k @xcite , and 4.0 w / mk at 1 atm , 314",
    "k @xcite of solid lif .      for this study , we compressed one direction of a b1 lif crystal while fixing the lateral dimension to a 4.02   lattice spacing to mimic initial phases of ramp compression with inertial confinement and examine the resulting differences in the thermal conductivity resulting from unequal principal strains .",
    "the compression direction was chosen to be @xmath85 , since this direction lacks surface polarization .",
    "the lateral directions were @xmath86 ( equivalent to @xmath85 ) and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the compressions @xmath88 examined corresponded to normal stresses 150 gpa in the compressed dimension ( note that 75 gpa md crystal was unstable and a dislocation formed ) and temperature range 10003000 k. it was not possible to predict which phases were thermodynamically stable over this deformation  temperature range since we predicted that b2 has unstable phonons over the range we examined .",
    "the phdos for b1 , fig.[fig : uniaxial_pdos ] , shows that the compressed direction becomes stiffer ( the sound speed is roughly inversely proportional to slope of phdos ) and higher frequency content is added to the phonon spectrum .",
    "fig.[fig : uniaxial_anisotropy ] shows stress response to these conditions and corresponding anisotropy of the thermal conductivity of the b1 structure .",
    "note that the initial lattice constant is not equilibrium at the given temperatures which immediately induces the anisotropy shown .",
    "also the lateral stresses become nearly equal but distinct from the normal stress in the compressed direction as the structure loses perfect crystallinity .",
    "fig.[fig : uniaxial_conductivity ] shows that the normal conductivity follows similar trends with temperature and pressure as in the volumetric compression case , namely in this state the highest conductivities are at the highest pressures and lowest temperatures .",
    "the data for this study is tabulated in table[tab : uniaxial_kappa ] .",
    "in summary , we found that the thermal conductivity of lif at high temperatures and pressures is only marginally dependent on phase and ranged from about 5 w / mk to 70 w / mk over the range 10004000 k and 100400 gpa .",
    "for our purposes , the fact that the two expected phases ( b1 and b2 ) have similar conductivity offsets the difficulties in determining their mechanical and thermodynamic stability .",
    "our estimates are corroborated by the limited experimental data available as well as direct _ ab initio _ estimates of thermal conductivity .",
    "we also found that the uniaxial deformation expected to result from inertia confinement of the targeted ramp compression experiments may lead to significant anisotropy in the thermal conductivity .",
    "more rigorous treatment of the relative phase stability exist in the literature than the method we selected , notably [ monserrat2013anharmonic ] which focussed on the influence of the anaharmonic phonon energy and [ desjarlais2013first ] which adapts the phase coexistence technique of [ lin2003two ] to finite temperature dft calculations , which may shed light on phase transitions from b1 at high temperatures and pressures . since our findings indicate that these transitions are unlikely over our temperature and pressure range of interest , whereas the formation of defects appear at relatively low uniaxial compression we intend to pursue investigation of the influence of defects on the thermal conductivity of solid lif next .",
