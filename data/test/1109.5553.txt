    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been in operation since the end of 2009 and has collided protons at center of mass energies @xmath1  tev , 2.76  tev and 7  tev and lead nuclei at @xmath0  tev .",
    "one of the experiments at the lhc is alice which focuses on measuring heavy - ion collisions and minimum - bias pp  collisions .",
    "the main goal of the analysis is to study the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which is postulated to be created in pb - pb interactions .",
    "one of the reasons to study pp  collisions is to provide a `` baseline '' for the heavy - ion measurements , so direct comparisons between the two collision types are especially interesting .    the qgp has been observed at lower energies at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite and possibly also at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern .",
    "one of the defining properties of the system created in such collisions is its rapid evolution , which was found to be well described by the collective models employing a hydrodynamics framework  @xcite . specifically , strong radial expansion ( radial flow ) as well as its elliptic asymmetry ( elliptic flow ) for non - central collisions have been observed and explained in the frame of such models .    in this work",
    "we focus on a particular observable , the femtoscopic correlation function  @xcite .",
    "it uses the width of the bose - einstein enhancement for identical pions at low relative momentum to measure the size of the region emitting particles .",
    "such measurements at lower energies in heavy - ion collisions have shown several features  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the extracted radii , in three dimensions in the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms ) scale linearly with the cube root of the pseudorapidity density @xmath5 .",
    "secondly the radii decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum , which is interpreted via the `` homogeneity lengths '' mechanism  @xcite as a signature of strong collective radial flow .",
    "both of these effects are expected at the lhc . at the same time",
    "femtoscopic radii have also been extracted in pp  collisions at rhic .",
    "the scaling between the minimum - bias pp  and heavy - ion data was observed .",
    "we aim to test such scalings in this work in the new energy regime .",
    "we note that the results for the central heavy - ion collisions have been published by the alice collaboration  @xcite , while some results for the pp  collisions have been also made public  @xcite .",
    "however the preliminary results for the pp  collisions at @xmath6  tev are shown for the first time in this work and the comparison of the pp  dataset for all @xmath7 to the heavy - ion collision data , including the alice central collision point , is also discussed for the first time .",
    "the analysis presented here was performed at the lhc with the alice detector .",
    "in particular the time projection chamber ( tpc ) was used for tracking and particle identification , the inner tracking system ( its ) was used for tracking , vertexing and trigger , and the vzero detectors were used for triggering and centrality determination in pb - pb collisions  @xcite . for the charged kaon analysis the alice time of flight ( tof ) detector  @xcite was used for particle identification .",
    "the pp  dataset at @xmath1  tev has been collected in may 2010 and consisted of roughly 4 million events passing the selection criteria .",
    "the dataset at 7  tev has been collected in june and consisted of roughly 60 million events .",
    "the dataset at 2.76  tev has been collected in march 2011 and consisted of roughly 20 million events .",
    "the pb - pb dataset at @xmath0  tev has been collected at the end of 2010 , the subsample of approximately 16 thousand events with centrality 0 - 5% of the total inelastic cross - section was selected for the analysis .        a minimum - bias trigger using the combination of the response from the inner layer of the its as well as the vzero detector was used for pp  collisions . in this analysis ,",
    "the events were also required to have an event vertex reconstructed within 12  cm of the center of the tpc and to have at least one pion identified .",
    "the events were categorized according to the raw total event multiplicity in @xmath8 , the value for the normalized pseudorapidity density @xmath9 was also determined for each of the ranges . for",
    "pb - pb collisions the events were required to have a vertex reconstructed within 12  cm of the center of the tpc and to be in the top 5% centrality bin according to the vzero detector .",
    "the tracks were reconstructed with the tpc ( and its for the pp  analysis ) , and were required to pass standard criteria for a good tracking fit .",
    "primary particles were selected by requiring that they point back to the primary vertex within 0.25  cm in the transverse plane . using the specific energy loss in the tpc the particles",
    "were identified as pions , with some electrons and kaons remaining .",
    "particles within @xmath8 were accepted for pp  analysis and those within @xmath10 for pb - pb collisions .",
    "the @xmath11 range was limited by the tpc acceptance and was from 0.15(0.2 )  gev / c to 2.0  gev / c for pp  ( pb - pb ) collisions .",
    "we have also performed preliminary analysis with identical kaons .",
    "charged tracks with @xmath12  gev/@xmath13 were required to be consistent with the kaon mass hypothesis in the tof detector to be accepted .",
    "a small contamination from electrons remained in the sample below this momentum .",
    "the @xmath14 were identified using the `` v0 '' decay topology in the tpc from two oppositely charged pions .",
    "the resulting purity was estimated to be 96% .    for pb - pb collisions",
    "a specific two - track separation cut was used to correct for the inefficiency of the reconstruction of two close tracks in the detector  @xcite .",
    "the identified primary pions in each event were combined into pairs to form the `` signal '' sample @xmath15 .",
    "the same was done for pair of pions where each of them came from a different event to form the uncorrelated `` background '' sample @xmath16 .",
    "the events used for the mixing had to have similar acceptance , so they were required to have event vertexes within 1  cm of each other , and be in the same multiplicity(centrality ) range .",
    "the correlation functions were constructed separately for each multiplicity / pair momentum range and collision energy by dividing @xmath15 over @xmath16 .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 were created as functions of the 3 components of the pair relative momentum @xmath17 in lcms , where the pair momentum along the beam axis vanishes .",
    "simple cartesian representation was used for pb - pb collisions while for pp  collisions the analysis was also done in the spherical harmonics ( sh ) decomposition  @xcite .",
    "an example of the correlation function is shown in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] .",
    "the first three non - vanishing sh components are shown ; they are enough to perform the fitting procedure described later .    in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] the correlation functions are shown for all three collision energies for the same multiplicity / pair momentum range .",
    "they are all similar , specifically the width of the low-@xmath17 enhancement is comparable .",
    "some differences in the magnitude of the enhancement is expected due to slightly different data taking conditions for the three samples .",
    "the correlation functions already suggest that the emission region size is independent of collision energy if measured for collisions with same multiplicity .",
    "the correlation functions can be analyzed quantitatively to extract the sizes of the emitting region .",
    "we use the assumption of the gaussian shape of the source which gives the following fit function : @xmath18 b(\\vec q ) \\nonumber   \\label{eq : cffit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the normalization factor , @xmath20 is the coulomb wave function squared averaged over a gaussian source with radius 1  fm , @xmath17 is the pair relative momentum , and @xmath21 s are the emission source sizes .",
    "@xmath16 is accounting for non - femtoscopic correlations measured in pp  collisions at the lhc which are described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath21 have three components , the `` long '' along the beam axis , `` out '' along the pair transverse momentum , and `` side '' perpendicular to the other two .",
    "figure  [ figthree ] shows the fitted femtoscopic radii in pp  collisions as a function of pair momentum for three collision energies , for selected multiplicity ranges where data from at least two collision energies is available . at same @xmath4 and multiplicity",
    "the radii do not depend on @xmath7 which confirms the finding with raw correlation functions .",
    "the radii universally grow with multiplicity except the highest @xmath4 points for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 shows a similar @xmath4 dependence at all multiplicities , with the overall scale growing with multiplicity .",
    "@xmath24 shows a flat @xmath4 dependence in low multiplicity collisions , and develops a negative slope as it increases . for @xmath22 a similar but more dramatic behavior",
    "is seen , the slope of the @xmath4 dependence is especially strong at larger multiplicities .",
    "the difference in behavior between @xmath22 and @xmath24 is most prominent in their ratio , which for high multiplicities goes significantly below 1.0 , much lower than any value observed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the qualitative behavior of radii , i.e. their decrease with @xmath4 , is similar to the one observed in heavy ions , however the details , especially the strong difference in the transverse radii behavior , show that the radial flow interpretation valid in heavy ions is not necessarily applicable to pp  collisions . more development on the theory side is needed to give a definite answer .",
    "two sets of dashed lines represent linear fits done separately to pp  and heavy - ion data , the dotted lines show the uncertainty of the fit parameters.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] .",
    "two sets of dashed lines represent linear fits done separately to pp  and heavy - ion data , the dotted lines show the uncertainty of the fit parameters.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] the multiplicity dependence of the femtoscopic radii is shown for the pp  collisions in the left panel .",
    "all collision energies are used , for two selected @xmath4 ranges .",
    "the lines represent linear fits to both @xmath4 sets , done separately in each direction . for all fits",
    "@xmath25 is below 1.0 ; for @xmath22 at lowest @xmath4 the lowest multiplicity points are not included in the fit .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath24 and @xmath23 with multiplicity is observed , while for @xmath22 the behavior changes from the increase at low @xmath4 to flattening or decreasing at higher @xmath4 , which can also be inferred from the radii seen in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] . nevertheless a linear scaling for all femtoscopic radii with multiplicity at collision energies different by almost an order of magnitude is seen .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figfour ] the linear dependence of the radii for pp  collisions is compared to the similar dependence from heavy - ion collisions , including the most recent results from the alice collaboration  @xcite , which extends the reach in @xmath26 by 50% .",
    "the linear fit is done separately to heavy ion data , without including the pp  points .",
    "the quality of the fit is worse than for pp  collisions , in fact fits to central data only gives significantly different dependence .",
    "regardless of which subset of data is fitted , the heavy - ion radii do not scale in the same way than the pp  ones , in all directions .",
    "we have checked other @xmath4 ranges and the same discrepancy is seen there .",
    "we conclude that the `` universal '' scaling of femtoscopic radii with final state multiplicity is violated by the pp  data .",
    "such strong statement is possible for the first time with alice data , because in collisions at @xmath27  tev multiplicities comparable to the peripheral heavy - ion collisions are produced , so direct comparison without any extrapolation can be done .",
    "it shows that any scaling law must take into account the initial configuration of the collision",
    ". it will be interesting to see if a scaling law can be proposed , that would accommodate both datasets .",
    "the alice most central datapoint is significantly further in the horizontal direction than the most central rhic au - au collision point .",
    "it can serve as a very good check of whether the approximate linear scaling of the radii seen at lower energies persists at the lhc .",
    "@xmath23 is following the linear scaling trend from lower energies , @xmath24 is also in agreement , but at the lower edge of the uncertainty in the scaling trend .",
    "@xmath22 however is clearly below the trend set by lower energies .",
    "such a discrepancy is not foreseen in simple scaling laws , but can be explained in hydrodynamic models  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to provide results for other centralities of the pb - pb collisions at the lhc to determine whether the scaling is recovered at lower multiplicities or if it is a feature of the system evolution at higher collision energy .",
    "bin size , vertical error bars are statistical only . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the preliminary analysis has been performed both for charged and neutral kaons .",
    "the available statistics allowed for 1-dimensional analysis only , multiplicity and pair momentum binning was possible .",
    "the results are show in fig .",
    "[ figfive ] .",
    "this is the first ever measurement of @xmath14 correlations in pp  collisions , and the first differential one ( previous measurements for @xmath28 and au - au collisions only produced a single multiplicity and pair momentum integrated value ) .",
    "the study of systematic errors is still ongoing ; they are presently estimated to be 20% for neutral kaons and",
    "30% for the charged ones .",
    "the kaon analysis extends the transverse momentum range for the radii by a factor of 3 as compared to pions .",
    "the neutral kaon radii extend the trend seen for identical pions smoothly , while the charged kaon radii are above the pion ones .",
    "the next step in the analysis is to obtain the expected radii from models of pp  collisions , especially to to compare them to predictions from models with and without a collective stage in the evolution of the elementary collision .",
    "we have presented the alice results of charged pion , charged kaon and neutral kaon femtoscopy of pp  collisions at three collision energies .",
    "the pion radii in three dimensions in lcms scale linearly with event multiplicity and show a decreasing trend with pair momentum",
    ". in narrow multiplicity and pair momentum ranges they are independent of the collision energy .",
    "the kaon results extend smoothly the pair momentum dependence to larger pair momenta .",
    "the results were compared to the ones from heavy - ion data , including the most central pb - pb datapoint at @xmath0  tev from alice .",
    "the pp  data show a significantly different linear dependence than the heavy - ion data .",
    "in addition deviations from the linear scaling are also observed for the alice pb - pb point , in agreement with some predictions from hydrodynamic models ."
