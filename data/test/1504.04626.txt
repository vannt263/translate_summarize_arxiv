    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are explosions of massive stars .",
    "massive stars do not explode as they are born . during their evolution to their death , which takes millions of years , the internal structures of the stars dramatically change and their masses can be reduced because of mass loss",
    ". they can also be affected by their binary companions .",
    "@xcite found that more than 70% of massive stars which can eventually explode are once in close binary systems .",
    "the effect of stellar duplicity on the stellar evolution has been studied ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "especially , core - collapse sne with little or no hydrogen ( sne  iil / iib / ib / ic ) have been suggested to come from binary systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "sn light - curve ( lc )",
    "modelling also supports this idea ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when a sn explosion occurs in a binary system , the sn and the companion star can be both affected by the explosion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several sn properties can be strongly affected by the existence of the companion .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k10 hereafter ) showed that the binary companion can alter the early x - ray / ultra - violet / optical sn lcs .",
    "the early optical brightness is increased because of the extra heating provided by the collision between the sn ejecta and the companion star .",
    "while early sn optical lcs are brightened by a collision , they are presumed to decline much more slowly than those without a collision ( k10 ) .",
    "relative to a normal , e.g. single - star , sn , the lc describing a collision between sn ejecta and a companion star is brighter ( k10 ) .",
    "energy from the collision counteracts adiabatic cooling after the shock breakout , thus slowing the lc decline .",
    "the lc of sn  ib  2008d was related to a collision because of the extremely slow lc decline during the 5 days after the explosion @xcite .",
    "sn lc simulations show that the early lc declines in sne  ibc caused by the adiabatic cooling in the sn ejecta only last about 1 day because their progenitors are compact ( wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "the lcs then become flat for several days because of helium recombination if a sufficient amount of helium is in the progenitors @xcite .",
    "the declining phase of the lc of sn  2008d lasted for about 5 days and is difficult to explain with standard compact wolf - rayet progenitors . because many sn  ibc progenitors are suggested to be in binary systems , @xcite proposed that the slow decline can be related to the collision of the sn ejecta with the binary companion .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the separation required to explain the early luminosity of sn  2008d is unrealistically small ( @xmath4 ) and it is not likely caused by the collision .",
    "they suggested that the @xmath5ni  mixing to the outermost layers of the sn ejecta lead to the early , slow lc decline rather than the collision .",
    "other plausible explanations for the slow lc decline include a large progenitor radius ( e.g. @xcite ) and the existence of an extended dense circumstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .    while a large fraction of core - collapse sn progenitors may be affected by the binary companion during their evolution , whether we can observe brightening in the early lcs is not obvious even if the progenitors are in binary systems .",
    "this is because not only the progenitors need to be in binary systems but also observers need to be within certain limited viewing angles from which the brightening can be observed ( k10 , fig .",
    "[ collision ] ) . in this paper , we investigate the expected fractions of core - collapse sne whose observed lcs are brightened by the collision based on a population synthesis model .",
    "our predicted fractions can be tested with future transient surveys .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ population ] , we summarize our population synthesis model and the general sn properties predicted from the model",
    ". then , we estimate the fractions of sne in which the early lc brightening by the collision is observable in section  [ fraction ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ discussion ] and conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .     at a separation @xmath6 ,",
    "a hole with the half opening angle of @xmath7 is created by the collision .",
    "the early lc brightening because of the collision can be observed when the observer is in the direction of the hole ( k10 ) . ]",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize our population synthesis modelling .",
    "we discuss the general sn properties predicted by our population synthesis model .",
    "we also discuss the uncertainties in our predictions .",
    "we model stellar evolution with the binary evolution code ` binary_c / nucsyn ` @xcite which is a modified and updated version of that presented by @xcite .",
    "we refer to these papers for the detailed physics and assumptions in the binary evolution model . of the key parameters in binary - star evolution",
    ", we set the common - envelope ejection efficiency , @xmath8 , to @xmath9 by default and use the fits to detailed models describing the envelope binding energy parameter , @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "wind mass loss is taken into account by following the prescription summarized in @xcite .",
    "a sn is assumed to occur when the carbon - oxygen core mass reaches a given maximum mass ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "when a star explodes in a binary system , the companion star is assumed to receive a kick velocity from a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of 190 @xmath13 , as is assumed in @xcite .",
    "our stellar populations are modelled by a three - dimensional parameter space of the primary mass , secondary mass , and orbital period .",
    "the primary mass is distributed according to the initial mass function of @xcite , and the secondary mass is chosen to be flat in the mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "the period distribution follows that of @xcite for o - type primary stars in excess of @xmath15 , @xcite for solar - like primary stars with mass below @xmath16 , and a fitting function interpolated linearly in primary mass between these two limiting masses .",
    "we evolve systems with primary masses from @xmath17  to  @xmath18 , mass ratios between @xmath19/@xmath20 and @xmath21 and orbital periods between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "all our stars have metallicity @xmath24 and start in circular orbits .",
    "the fraction of stars in binary systems in our stellar populations is based on @xcite .",
    "all the stars which are o - type or b - type at the zero - age main sequence are assumed to be in binary systems initially .",
    "therefore , the initial binary fraction of our sn progenitors is essentially 100% .",
    "observations indicate that the fraction of ob stars in binary systems are more than 70% @xcite .",
    "single stars in these observations may be observed as single because they are merged stars or their companion stars have already exploded .",
    "thus , the actual initial binary fractions are not well - known and we simply assume the 100% binary fraction in this study .",
    "the population synthesis model described in the previous section predicts several sn properties",
    ". the total core - collapse sn rate of the galaxy predicted from the model is @xmath25 , assuming a galactic star - formation rate of @xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite and the average stellar mass from the kroupa initial mass function ( 0.83 @xmath28 ) .",
    "this rate is consistent with the estimated galactic core - collapse sn rate from recent surveys [ e.g. @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xcite ] .",
    "we determine the sn type of the exploding stars based on the stellar composition .",
    "while there exist many types of core - collapse sne , we only consider three sn types ( ii , iib , and ibc ) for simplicity .",
    "if hydrogen remains in sn progenitors , the sne are classified as type  ii or iib .",
    "we try to identify type  iib because several sn  iib progenitors are suggested to be in binary systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the progenitors of the two sn types is presumed to be in the remaining hydrogen - rich envelope mass , but the exact mass dividing the two types is not well - constrained . in our standard model ,",
    "we classify the progenitors with the hydrogen - rich envelope mass smaller than 4.5 @xmath31  as type  iib and the other hydrogen - rich progenitors as type  ii .",
    "the dividing mass 4.5 @xmath31  is chosen so that the type  iib fraction in our model is similar to the observed fraction ( @xmath3% , @xcite ) . however , the dividing mass 4.5 @xmath31  is higher than the 2 @xmath31  used in other progenitor studies ( e.g. @xcite ) or those estimated from observational properties ( @xmath32 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also show the results with the dividing mass of 2 , 0.5 , and 0.1 @xmath31 .",
    "as is shown in the following sections , the sn  iib fractions in core - collapse sne are affected by the dividing mass but the observational fractions of the early lc brightening because of the collision are not much .",
    "if a sn is hydrogen - free , it is classified as type  ibc . because the differences in the progenitors of type  ib and ic sne may not simply come from the remaining helium mass and they are not well - known ( e.g. @xcite ) , we do not sub - divide the hydrogen - free sne .",
    "the fractions of each sn type are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the fractions of hydrogen - rich sne ( types  ii and iib ) and the hydrogen - free sne ( type  ibc ) obtained from our population synthesis model match the observations reasonably ( type  ii including all the subtypes @xmath33% and type  ibc @xmath34% , @xcite ) , although type ibc sne are slightly overproduced ( see also discussion on uncertainties in section  [ unce ] ) . when the dividing mass between type ii and type iib is set to 2 , 0.5 , and 0.1  @xmath31 , the sn  iib fractions become 2.9% , 2.2% , and 2.0% , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of hydrogen - free sne is not affected by the dividing mass of the two hydrogen - rich sn types .",
    "to summarize , our population synthesis model reproduces bulk observational properties of core - collapse sne , namely , the rate and the fraction of the hydrogen - rich and hydrogen - free sne , reasonably well .",
    "thus , the model is presumed to represent the binary properties of sn progenitors reasonably .      because the number of stars used in our population synthesis calculations is sufficiently large , the errors in the estimated fractions below are mainly systematic . to evaluate the systematic uncertainties ,",
    "we perform the binary population synthesis calculations with several model assumptions .",
    "the largest deviation in the predicted fractions we found is by a factor of 1.5 from the standard fraction shown in the next section when we reduce the common - envelope ejection efficiency @xmath11 to 0.5 from the standard value @xmath35 .",

    "the binary fractions are smaller at the time of the explosion than at the time of the birth because a sn progenitor can leave the binary system when its companion star explodes earlier .",
    "stellar mergers also reduce the binary fractions . because sn  ii progenitors tend to have longer life times , their binary fraction is more reduced when they explode than that of sn  ibc progenitors . the binary fraction is larger in sne  ibc because more mass can be lost in the binary systems because of the binary interactions during the evolution , allowing the progenitors in the binary systems to strip the hydrogen - rich envelope more easily .",

    "[ angledistribution ] shows the distributions of @xmath40 for each sn type in our standard model .",
    "although the binary fractions are similar in sne  ii and iib in our population synthesis model , sn  iib progenitors have larger @xmath40 , making the observable fraction larger .",
    "this is because hydrogen - rich sn progenitors in closer binary systems can lose their envelope more easily by the binary interaction during the evolution .",
    "compared to the hydrogen - rich sne , sne  ibc have a much larger observable fraction , 0.53% , thanks to the larger binary fraction and the flatter distribution of @xmath40 ( fig .  [ angledistribution ] ) . in other words",
    ", we expect to observe the brightening in about @xmath53 out of 1000 sne  ibc with early discoveries .",
    "we have shown that the fractions of core - collapse sne in which the lc brightening from the binary collision can be observed are very small .",
    "the predicted small observational probabilities disfavour the argument that the early slow lc decline observed in sn  ib  2008d is because of the collision with the binary @xcite , given the total number of the well - observed sn  ibc lcs is about 100 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the separation needs to be @xmath54  cm to explain the early lc of sn  2008d by the collision based on their estimates of the sn properties .",
    "our population synthesis result indicates that the systems with @xmath54  cm in sne ibc are extremely rare ( fig .",
    "[ sepangleibc ] ) , because this separation is the typical radius of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "this further suggests that the early slow lc decline is not likely because of the collision .",
    "other mechanisms are likely to be related to the mysterious slow lc decline of sn  2008d in its early epoch .    except for sn  2008d ,",
    "there are no reported sne  ibc with the clear early slow lc decline ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the estimates from our population synthesis .",
    "sn  ibc lcs with the observations early enough to see the collisional effect are still rare .",
    "our prediction that 0.53% of sne  ibc are brightened by the collision can be tested by future large sn surveys .",
    "for example , the large synoptic survey telescope expects @xmath55 sn  ibc discoveries per year @xcite and it will find @xmath3 sne  ibc with the early brightening by the collision per year if they are detected early enough .",
    "the zwicky transient facility is also likely to be capable of detecting such event thanks to their emphasis on the early sn discovery @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "the early slow lc declines of sne  iib are frequently observed ( e.g. @xcite ) and the observed sn fraction with the early slow lc decline is presumed to be much larger than the fraction estimated here .",
    "@xcite argued that the extremely large radii required to explain the early slow lc decline observed in sne  iib ( e.g. @xmath56 for sn  1993j , @xcite ) may indicate that they are actually brightened by the binary collision .",
    "however , the predicted fractions in our model to observe the collisional brightening in sne  iib ( @xmath57% ) are even smaller than those in sne  ibc ( @xmath58% ) .",
    "thus , the slow lc declines often observed in sne  iib are presumed to be mostly from another cause , e.g. the extended early cooling phase caused by the large progenitor radii .",
    "it is interesting to note that sne  iib are suggested to come from both compact and extended progenitors @xcite .",
    "if we can identify the compactness of sn  iib progenitors by multi - wavelength observations like the radio observations demonstrated by @xcite and the early slow declines are associated with the compact progenitors , the early slow declines are more likely to be related to the collision because of the rapid adiabatic cooling of the compact sn ejecta . in our standard population synthesis model , about @xmath59% of sne  iib have progenitors with radii smaller than 10  @xmath60 .",
    "this fraction increases as the dividing mass decreases because closer binary systems tend to lose more envelope mass . when the dividing mass is 0.1  @xmath31 ,",
    "about 60% of the sn iib progenitors have radii shorter than 10  @xmath60 .",
    "this kind of information in sne  iib may be used to understand the physics involved in the binary evolution ( cf .",
    ".    an interesting feature of the lcs affected by the collision is the strong dependence of the luminosity on the separation ( k10 ) .",
    "the early isotropic bolometric luminosity @xmath61 by the collision observed within @xmath40 is formulated by k10 as , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the sn ejecta mass , @xmath64 is the sn ejecta velocity colliding to the binary star , @xmath65 is the electron scattering opacity in the sn ejecta , and @xmath66 is the time since the explosion .",
    "the luminosity is proportional to the separation because the collisional heating at longer separations is less affected by the subsequent adiabatic cooling ( k10 ) . in fig .",
    "[ sepangleibc ] , we plot the fraction distribution of the sn  ibc progenitors in binary systems at the time of the explosion .",

    "this indicates that the early luminosity affected by the collision is most likely to be @xmath68 @xmath69 for sne  ibc with a typical ejecta mass of 2 @xmath31  @xcite . because the binary configuration of the most probable systems is similar to the system with which the lc brightening is simulated by k10 in terms of the ratio of the separation to the companion radius ( a factor of a few ) , the sn  ibc lcs with the collisional brightning",
    "are presumed to be similar to those in k10 . for sne  ii and iib ,",
