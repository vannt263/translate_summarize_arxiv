    "overwhelming observational evidence @xcite implies the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , whose nature is still unknown . searching for dm is now a major research theme in both particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "the former mainly focusses on direct detection by experiments sensitive to the interaction of dm particles with normal matter , while the latter uses indirect methods , including measurements of the end products of dm annihilation / decay ( e.g. @xmath1-ray , @xmath2 pairs ) or mapping of gravitationally lensed structures .",
    "a number of particle physics scenarios have been proposed for the nature of dm . among these scenarios ,",
    "the most compelling is that of the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) that acts as cold dark matter and effectively explains the origin of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "theories generally hypothesize wimps that interact with normal matter no more strongly than the weak force and therefore direct observation is challenging .",
    "if dm is a form of a thermal relic particle that was once in thermal equilibrium in the very early universe , then it may light up galactic substructures by self - pair annihilations .",
    "in addition , dm decay products may also be a source that is comparable to annihilation .",
    "the absolute @xmath1-ray intensity depends on the wimp annihilation cross section or decay rate , particle type , particle mass , and astrophysical distributions , all of which are poorly known .",
    "the relative annihilation / decay luminosity is density - dependent , which may offer insight into the nature of dm , e.g. the decay signal is proportional to density while the annihilation luminosity is proportional to density squared .",
    "additional correction factors may be applied to the standard velocity - weighted thermal cross section @xmath3 .",
    "one example is the sommerfeld boost  a nonperturbative increase in the annihilation cross - section at low velocities that is the result of a generic attractive force between the incident dm particles .",
    "baryons could also play an important role in determining the profiles of dm halos .",
    "adiabatic contraction induced by the infall of baryonic matter could steepen the dm density profile substantially , e.g. to @xmath4 from a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) @xcite profile @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another possible correction to the annihilation cross - section that has not been previously discussed in the galactic context is that of @xmath6-wave suppressed annihilations , as might be important for spin - dependent interactions .",
    "diffuse galactic @xmath1-ray emission ( dge ) is believed to be produced by interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the launch of the fermi gamma - ray satellite , with its large area telescope ( lat ) , enabled a detailed study of cosmic - ray origin and propagation , and of the interstellar medium . in a recent study @xcite",
    ", the fermi - lat team published an analysis of the measurements of the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission from the first 21 months of the fermi mission .",
    "they compared the data with models generated by the galprop code , and showed that these emission templates underpredict the fermi - lat data at energies of a few gev in the inner galaxy .",
    "this can possibly be explained by undetected point - source populations and variations of the cosmic ray spectra . @xcite",
    "have performed an analysis of the dge in the milky way halo region to search for a signal from dark matter annihilations or decays .",
    "they considered a large region covering the central part of the galactic halo while masking out the galactic plane .",
    "in such a region , the dm signal would have a large s / n ratio and would not depend on detailed assumptions about the center profile , e.g. the assumptions of a nfw profile or a cored profile would only differ by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "this paper provided conservative limits on the dm cross - section assuming that all the @xmath1-ray signal comes from dm in this region .",
    "they also provided more stringent limits based on modeling the foreground @xmath1-ray signal with the galprop code .",
    "their results impact the possible mass range over which dm is produced thermally in the early universe and challenge the dm annihilation interpretation of pamela / fermi - lat cosmic ray anomalies .",
    "however , several points could be improved : 1 ) although using a nfw profile for modeling pure dm and a cored profile for modeling the baryonic matter effect covers extreme cases , it is still worth trying a more realistic profile directly from simulations ; 2 ) in addition to the mass and cross - section of the dm particle , the different annihilation / decay schemes may also play an important role , e.g. subhalo effects would become considerably strong in the region of interest where tidal disruption plays a role and especially when considering possible sommerfeld enhancements ; and 3 ) instead of detecting dm signal from the region that masks out the galactic center region , it may be of interest to search for a possible signal from the center or anticenter regions . therefore , a good template for the galactic center or the full sky should provide more constraints on the dm physics ; 4 ) the spatially dependent velocity dispersion of the dm due to substructure plays an important role both in considering sommerfeld or @xmath8wave enhanced annihilation signals , and simulations can provide this information .",
    "the contribution of dm annihilation / decay processes to the fermi - lat @xmath1-ray signal in the galactic center ( or its expected signal from subhalos in the galactic halo ) is difficult to quantify without knowing the galactic distribution of dark matter and the dark matter particle properties leading to annihilations or decays . to compare the observations with predictions of dm emission",
    ", we must rely on numerical simulations that follow the formation of cosmic structure in the highly non - linear regime .",
    "a few high - resolution simulations of milky way - sized halos have been completed over the last few years : the aquarius project @xcite , the via lactea series @xcite , and the ghalo run @xcite .",
    "the ability of the fermi - lat satellite to detect dm annihilation signals from galactic subhalos has been previously studied by @xcite and @xcite using the high - resolution via lactea ii ( vlii ) n - body simulation .",
    "to date , there has been no clear signal of dark matter annihilations or decays in the outer galactic halo .",
    "there are numerous possible explanations for non - detection in the outer galactic halo combined with the observed dge in the galactic center , including simulated dm - only structure being inconsistent with the actual galactic structure , the predicted dm annihilation / decay luminosity from particle physics being overly optimistic , or some misunderstanding of the observational data .",
    "motivated by the range of possible explanations for the excess of dge data to the model , we present a study of various possible galactic dm contributions to the observed dge emission .",
    "we construct several maps of gamma - ray emission from different dm annihilation / decay scenarios in order to illustrate how each scenario may offer additional templates to fit the fermi data .",
    "we additionally compared dm annihilation signals in each scenario to the dge model from the galprop code of @xcite in different regions on the sky .",
    "we organize the rest of this paper as follows : in @xmath9[sec : darkmatter ] , we give a description of different dm annihilation / decay schemes . our data processing method and @xmath1-ray generating algorithm",
    "are described in @xmath9[sec : simulation ] .",

    "since @xmath24 and @xmath20 are unknown , the normalization is arbitrary . for a given astrophysical dm distribution",
    ", the @xmath23 factors given here determine the relative intensity of the predicted flux .",

    "the detailed host halo properties can be found in @xcite .    to produce the @xmath1-ray maps , we follow @xcite and locate a fiducial ` observer ' 8 kpc from the host halo center along the intermediate principle axis of the ellipsoid .",

    "this is an extremely compute - intensive task , it takes more than 8 hours on a regular cpu to produce a single map with the 400 m particles . in order to be able to create the maps involving the different annihilation scenarios and different viewpoints , we have developed a novel gpu - based algorithm@xcite .    in this method",
    ", we projected @xmath60 onto two separate tangential planes of the two celestial hemispheres using stereographic projection , then remapped these to the final healpix projections .",
    "we have realized that the problem can be reduced to rendering a projected density profile of a particle , weighted by different factors depending on the physics of the annihilation . as these computations became quite similar to those used in visualization",
    ", we were able to implement them in the shader language of opengl ( open graphics library ) on a high - end nvidia gpu for maximum performance .",

    "even with the high resolution of vlii , only a portion of the hierarchal structure of dm clumps is resolvable . in principle , the wimp dm substructure has mass power all the way down to the mass of the dm kinetic or thermal decoupling scales , of order @xmath61 these unresolved structures will boost the final brightness of the @xmath1-ray emission according to the @xmath62 dependence ( while decay is not affected due to the @xmath18 dependence ) .",
    "detailed studies of the boost factor @xmath63 can be found in @xcite . although as pointed out by springel et al @xcite and fornasa et al . @xcite the unresolved subhalo component provides a important source of emission , springel et al",

    "in practice , this component is unlikely to be distinguishable from other emission components . to include the emission of unresolved subhalos",

    "the pamela @xcite and ams-02 results @xcite show a rise in positron fraction at high energy and a hardening of the spectral index , while no antiproton excesses were found .",
    "if this signal were due to annihilation , the standard thermal cross - section @xmath24 would be too small to simultaneously fit @xmath2 and avoid antiproton excesses . to gain a larger cross - section , a force carrier @xmath68 @xcite",
    "is proposed for mediating the dm particle interaction .",
    "this mediator could be a standard model particle or an unknown boson responsible for dark sector forces .",
    "assuming the dm particle is a majorana or dirac fermion , such a process is denoted as @xmath69 .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement @xcite can be therefore calculated . for the resonance case (",

    "the sommerfeld cross - section must saturate in a viable model : we take this saturation to be @xmath77 km / s , above the resolution limit of our simulations . from our point of view , this amounts to a renormalisation that we ignore : it is the profile shape and clumpiness that we care about . the cross - section for dm particle pair annihilation changes significantly over the simulation range caused by velocity changes in different environments , i.e. by a factor @xmath78 or more @xcite .",

    "when structure is forming , baryonic matter dissipates its thermal and kinetic energy and falls to the center of the dm halo .",
    "the condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dm halos will adiabatically contract the dm density distribution and lead to a denser profile in the center .",
    "this effect is implied from both theoretical and observational studies @xcite .",
    "adiabatic contraction is generally studied using the standard contraction model ( sac ) as introduced by @xcite . however , hydrodynamic simulations show that the contraction is weaker and a modified adiabatic contraction model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we consider the baryonic matter contraction effect only in the host halo , where there is enough baryonic matter to cause the contraction .",

    "the smooth component also differs for the six scenarios in terms of both the central maximum and the profile slope , as shown in fig-[fig : fluxprof ] .",
    "the adiabatic contraction case has a steep central profile such that the normalization of the total flux overwhelms the relatively small contribution from substructure .",
    "it looks more spherical in the all - sky map because of the assumption of spherical nfw@xmath95 contraction ( fig-[fig : allskymap]e ) .",

    "we select a random position sitting 8kpc away from the gc to get an all - sky map of the subhalo component such that there is no subhalo too bright or too close to the observer . after that , we combine the subhalo component and main halo component to get a properly centered profile .",

    "these comparisons provide us with intuition on how these different profiles would work if used to fit the real data .",
    "for example , in the upper panels , the dge signal shows a relatively flat profile compared to the longitudinal profiles of the five annihilation cases .",

    "our results which consider six different physical scenarios present an extension of these results .",
    "we leave a more detailed study of anisotropies ( which must have the boost factor carefully calculated ) to a future project .",
    "in addition to the diffuse emission , we are able to use our maps to study the point sources from fermi - lat . for annihilations ,",
    "when we add in the sommerfeld enhancement , the number density of detected small halos increases . for the @xmath31 case",
    ", the substructure almost dominates the radiation field other than in the galactic center .",
    "fig-[fig : fluxfunc ] shows the flux functions of sub - halos for different cases .",
    "the flux of the subhalos are calculated by summing over the flux of all pixels inside the halo s angular radius .",
    "all the curves converge at @xmath119 since the total number of sub - halos in the simulation is fixed at @xmath120 .",
    "the curve for the sommerfeld enhancement @xmath31 is much steeper than the other curves , which indicates that the subhalos are brighter than in other models .",
    "we further plot the detectable point sources ( with angle extending less than @xmath121 @xcite ) in fig-[fig : numfunc ] .",
    "compared to @xcite , these curves are shallower than the identified and unidentified sources in the second fermi - lat source catalog for the inner region , but are relatively flat at larger latitudes .",
    "all of these features imply that observable dm signals could come from off - center subhalos .    in summary",
    ", we are not aiming to set new constraints on dm annihilations or decays , but rather to provide possible new templates ( the smooth components ) to fit the dge data with dark matter models and illustrate the possible range of profiles for plausible models .",
    "compared to a simple assumption that the dm halo has a nfw or an isothermal profile , our results based on the simulation data are more realistic ( e.g. fig-[fig : densityprofile ] ) .",
    "the effects of subhalos could be also be statistically included in the templates , e.g. aps or used to provide as estimates of the uncertainties .",
    "the galactic central region might be a promising region for detecting a dm signal as recently pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the various dm maps we present here show significant observational differences when the dm annihilation / decay physics are changed .",
    "the morphology of the center region is also asymmetric and complex , and simple analytical templates may fail to match the real signal .",
    "there are three key points that we wish to emphasize here .",
    "firstly , compared to the fermi dge result , the annihilation signal , with or without sommerfeld enhancement , has distinctly different central profiles .",
    "the shape of the fermi excess profile in the fermi bubble region has recently been used as a means of discriminating dark matter from millisecond pulsar models of the central excess @xcite .",
    "our philosophy here is similar but we extend this approach to probing the nature of dm annihilations .",
    "we predict different profiles for the alternative dark matter annihilation models .",
    "the differences are especially notable for decaying dark matter , for which the flux profile is very flat .",
    "secondly , it is clear that some of our models , especially the sommerfeld cases , provide more bright substructures than are allowed by the observations in terms of unresolved and unidentified point sources .",
    "we leave it to others to make detailed comparisons with the data , but our predicted cumulative counts of subhalos should provide a basic comparison . the @xmath8wave annihilation case is a promising model since it removes many of these bright substructures . the model including adiabatic contraction has a similar effect of de - emphasizing the substructure by increasing the contrast between host halo core and the ( unadiabatically contracted ) subhalos , although the quantitative role of adiabatic contraction of the dm in halos remains controversial .",
    "finally we note that we have not included any spectral signatures , which differ among the various adopted annihilation channels and particle masses : for example the sommerfeld models require high values for the particle mass ( @xmath122 tev ) and hence would be best constrained through observational data at relatively high photon energies .",
    "we thank michael kuhlen for his help on developing our algorithm .",
