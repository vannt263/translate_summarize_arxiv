    "in this work , we investigate the aharonov - bohm phase difference picked up by charged particles that go around a closed space - time loop in the presence of the time - dependent potentials and fields of an electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "theoretical investigations of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite generally involve time - independent potentials .",
    "the canonical example of the aharonov - bohm effect is that of charged particles in a two - slit experiment with an infinite solenoid , carrying a constant magnetic flux , placed between the slits . each charged particle picks up an additional phase due to the non - zero vector potential outside the solenoid , even though the electric and magnetic fields outside the solenoid are zero .",
    "the experimental tests of the aharonov - bohm effect have also generally been done with time - independent fields @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the time - independent aharonov - bohm effect , there have been only a few theoretical studies of the _ time - dependent _ aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "some of the works @xcite have focused on a solenoid with a time - dependent magnetic flux , while others @xcite have used an electromagnetic plane wave to obtain time - dependent potentials and fields .    on the experimental side",
    ", there are only two cases that we have found where the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect was tested experimentally .",
    "the first test was an accidental experiment by marton _",
    "@xcite where an electron two - slit interference experiment was set up and the interference pattern was observed .",
    "however , it was later determined that the region through which the electrons traveled was contaminated with a 60 hz magnetic field of unknown strength .",
    "the question in regard to the results of the accidental experiment in @xcite are :  why was the interference pattern seen at all ?",
    "why did it not shift back a forth at 60 hz ? \" at first , it was thought that the result of marton _ et al .",
    "_ was evidence against the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "however , two explanations have been put forward as to why the experiment in @xcite saw a static interference pattern . in @xcite",
    ", the idea was advanced that the time varying aharonov - bohm phase was compensated for by a phase shift coming from the direct @xmath2 force which acted on the electrons . in @xcite ,",
    "the explanation given for the observation of the static interference pattern in @xcite was due to a cancellation between the time varying aharonov - bohm phase and a phase coming from the induced electric field that accompanied the time varying magnetic field .",
    "the second test of the time - dependent aharonov - bohm was the experiment in @xcite .",
    "this experiment used fields from an electromagnetic wave with a frequency in the microwave region and was along the lines of the set - up suggested in @xcite for testing the time varying aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "this experiment was also along the lines of @xcite , which studied decoherence effects due to the time varying aharonov - bohm phase coming from an electromagnetic wave .",
    "the results of the experiment described in @xcite were that evidence for an aharonov - bohm phase from the time varying fields and potentials was not observed  thus these results were similar to the accidental experiment of marton _ et al .",
    "_ , where the effect of the time variation was not seen in the interference pattern .",
    "the explanation of the non - observation of the time variation in the experiment @xcite was that the parameters of the set - up were such that the time variation effect was too small to be seen @xcite .",
    "we come to a similar conclusion from our analysis  in order to observe the time variation one must carefully chose the various parameters of the set - up : the frequency and amplitude of the electromagnetic wave , the size of the loop , the velocity of the particle , _ etc . _ in the conclusion , we give conditions under which one might see evidence of the time varying aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "there are two points to make before we move on to our detailed analysis .",
    "first , the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect is invariably a type ii aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the type i aharonov - bohm effect is when the charged particle develops a phase while moving through a region that is free of electric and magnetic fields , as in the original time - independent , infinite solenoid set - up .",
    "the type ii aharonov - bohm effect is when the charged particle develops an aharonov - bohm phase , but while moving through a region of space where the fields are not zero .",
    "a typical example of a type ii effect is the aharonov - casher effect @xcite , where a neutral particle with a magnetic moment moves through an electric field and , in doing so , picks up a aharonov - bohm - like phase .",
    "second , the set - up we study here is a combination and generalization of the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect studied in @xcite and @xcite . in particular for our set - up , both the electric and magnetic aharonov - bohm effects are non - zero . in reference",
    "@xcite , the set - up was taken so that only the time varying magnetic field gave an aharonov - bohm phase , while in reference @xcite , the set - up was such that only the time varying electric field gave a non - zero contribution to the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "further , these two prior works calculated the aharonov - bohm phase in different ways : reference @xcite used the line integral of the potentials to obtain the phase while reference @xcite used the area integral of the fields . here , we calculate the phase using both the line integral of the potentials and the area integral of the fields .",
    "this provides an explicit working out of stokes theorem in 4d . in the literature",
    ", we have found no examples of this , although there are of course plenty of explicit worked out examples of stokes theorem in 3d .",
    "in this section , we give the set - up for the potentials , fields and path that we will use .",
    "we consider a linearly polarized plane wave traveling along the @xmath3-axis in either the @xmath4 or @xmath5 direction .",
    "the covariant , four - vector potential for this is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the amplitude and @xmath8 are the frequency and wave number for the wave . the @xmath9 sign is a wave traveling in the @xmath10 direction and the @xmath11 is a wave traveling in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields can be obtained from using @xmath13 with the result @xmath14 where prime means a derivative with respect to the argument of @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 .",
    "the electromagnetic wave in is polarized in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "we could consider a more complicated wave traveling in the @xmath3-direction , with the electric and magnetic fields having components in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "the vector potential for such wave would have the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are amplitudes and @xmath21 are phases . for our purposes ,",
    "the four - potential in is sufficient since for the closed loop path that we pick , with no motion of the particles in the @xmath18 direction , only the @xmath17 component of the four - vector potential will contribute .",
    "if we had picked our loop to be in the @xmath22 plane , then it would be a vector potential of the form @xmath23 which would give a non - zero contribution .",
    "the closed space - time path that we chose in evaluating the loop integral @xmath24 is shown fully in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the projections in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 planes are shown , respectively , in figure [ fig2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] . in the experiment",
    ", the charged particles would travel both paths @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in the forward time - direction , _",
    "i.e. _ the charged particles would leave the origin and travel forward along @xmath27 and @xmath28 and also forward along @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with each picking up some different aharonov - bohm phase along these paths . to take the phase _ difference _ between path @xmath27 and @xmath28 versus path @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", one puts a negative sign in front of the integral along path @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( or as well one could put the negative sign in front of the integrals along path @xmath27 and @xmath28 , thus reversing the direction of the space time loop in figure [ fig1 ] ) . in this way , one ends with a closed space - time loop integral .",
    "this is what is done in the usual static aharonov - bohm analysis , but with purely spatial loop integrals .",
    "the paths start from the origin , @xmath31 , and then travel with velocity @xmath32 , for a time @xmath33 , to the two spatial points @xmath34 .",
    "this gives paths @xmath27 and @xmath30 .",
    "from these two points , one traces back to the point @xmath35 in a time @xmath33 ( this means a total time of @xmath36 ) ; this gives paths @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note , the total time from the origin to @xmath35 is @xmath36 , so @xmath37 .",
    "now , for the explicit evaluation of @xmath24 in the next section , we need to give the equations describing each path : @xmath38    the magnitude of the velocity along any path is @xmath39 . for the projections of the full space - time path from figure [ fig1 ] into the @xmath25 plane in figure [ fig2 ] , the slopes of the paths are greater than 1 since @xmath40 .    for the aharonov - bohm effect with a plane wave background , both",
    "the electric and magnetic aharonov - bohm effects can be non - trivial at the same time .",
    "for the usual static magnetic aharonov - bohm effect , the line integral of the the 3-vector potential , @xmath41 , is related to the surface area of the magnetic field via stokes theorem in 3d , @xmath42 . in order for this magnetic aharonov - bohm phase to be non - zero",
    ", the magnetic field , @xmath43 , must have a component along the area normal direction , @xmath44 .",
    "for our space - time area , the spatial projection is in the @xmath45 plane , which therefore has a spatial area direction in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "this then gives a non - zero contribution for the magnetic field of the plane wave since @xmath46 .",
    "for the usual static electric aharonov - bohm effect , it is the time integral of the scalar potential , @xmath47 , which is important ( @xmath48 ) . using @xmath49",
    ", one finds that the electric aharonov - bohm phase can be written as @xmath50 .",
    "note that the spatial area of the magnetic case , @xmath51 , is replaced by a space - time area @xmath52 . in order to get an electric contribution to the aharonov - bohm phase",
    ", the electric field must have a component along the direction of the path .",
    "for the wave traveling in the @xmath3-direction , and for the area of the loop which has a projection in the @xmath45 plane , both the magnetic field in the @xmath18-direction and the electric field in the @xmath17-direction will give non - zero contributions to the time varying aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "in the case studied in @xcite , the wave was taken to be traveling in the @xmath18-direction , the electric field was polarized in the @xmath3-direction , and the magnetic field was in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the loop chosen in @xcite was also in the @xmath45 plane , so , in that situation , there was only a non - zero electric aharonov - bohm phase ; the magnetic aharonov - bohm phase was zero .",
    "in our set - up _ both _ the magnetic and electric ahronov - bohm phases play a role .",
    "using the above set - up , we now calculate @xmath24 , which gives the aharonov - bohm phase when multiplied by @xmath53 . we will calculate the phase picked up along the four path lengths given in figure [ fig1 ] and then add them .",
    "the electromagnetic wave has a frequency and wave number given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which satisfy @xmath56 .",
    "the velocity on any given leg of the path in figure [ fig1 ] is @xmath32 .    in carrying out the calculation for the loop integral for the case in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", we will first calculate @xmath24 in the frame where @xmath57 ; this is the",

    "first , we can look at an expansion of the function @xmath95 , where @xmath96 or @xmath97 , depending on which term in one is expanding . using this , one finds that becomes @xmath98 thus , to first order in @xmath93 , the time varying aharonov - bohm phase vanishes .",
    "this result can be compared to the result in @xcite @xcite , where the authors found that for a solenoid with a time varying flux , the time - dependent part of the aharonov - bohm phase vanishes to first order as well .",
    "next , if we take the particle speed to be much less than the speed of light , @xmath99 , then , from , @xmath100 .",
    "hence the condition @xmath101 is identical to @xmath102 , or equivalently @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the wavelength and the period of the electromagnetic wave . since the approximate vanishing of @xmath24 requires @xmath106 , the condition above imposed on the wavelength or the period of the electromagnetic wave is a condition for the approximate vanishing of the loop integral . at the end of the next section ,",
    "we will comment more on the use of the result in to determine when the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect is important / observable .",
    "one final question we want to address :  under what conditions does @xmath24 vanish exactly \" . according to and , if @xmath107 , the loop integral vanishes , which in turn means @xmath108 according to . thus , if the particle traverses the loop at close to @xmath109 and moves in the same direction as the electromagnetic wave ( in this case the @xmath3 -direction ) the time - dependent aharonov - bohm phase will vanish .",
    "this was the same conclusion reached for the time dependent , non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect @xcite using the time - dependent , non - abelian plane waves of coleman @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , due to the constraint @xmath110 , @xmath111 means @xmath112 , the @xmath17-component of the velocity is vanishingly small , and that the diamond shaped loop becomes elongated in the @xmath3 direction since the ratio of the lengths goes as @xmath113 .",
    "there is another way that the loop integral vanishes exactly .",
    "rewriting in terms of the original function @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 where the notation is similar to equation and with the intervals defined as @xmath116 where @xmath117 , the phase change to the half - way point .",
    "this means that if the average of the vector potential experienced by the particle in the first half , @xmath118 , is the same as the average of that experienced in the latter half , @xmath119 , then the loop integral vanishes .",
    "this happens , for example , if @xmath74 is constant , i.e. the integrand function @xmath120 is linear with respect to @xmath121 ( this is another way of giving the result from that @xmath24 vanishes up to first order in @xmath122 ) , or if the particles travels at the speed of light (  riding the waves \" ) along @xmath3 in the same direction as the waves ( as @xmath121 itself remains constant along the path for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the average vector potential of the first and second halves cancels each other out also if the periodicity of the waves is such that the particle on the path encounters integer number of the wavelengths in @xmath33 .",
    "in this section , we work out the aharonov - bohm phase using the electric and magnetic fields and taking the  area \" integrals .",
    "this is a 4d example of the usual 3d stokes theorem , where one finds @xmath123 . in the 4d case ,",
    "we want @xmath124 , where we have written the 4d area @xmath125 , using the antisymmetric wedge product .",
    "concise details of this notation can be found in @xcite .",
    "taking only the components of electric and magnetic fields given in , we have @xmath126 in the right hand side , we have written the tensor components in three vector notation with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the first term is a space - time area integral of the electric field , @xmath129 , and the second term is a purely spatial area integral of the magnetic field , @xmath130 . as in section iii",
    "we will do the  upright diamond \" area and show that this is equivalent to the loop integral of the  upright diamond \" from .",
    "then by boosting in the @xmath3 direction , one can obtain the area intergal for the general surface from figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "for the upright diamond loop one has a surface only in the @xmath131-plane ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , and therefore only an electric contribution : @xmath132    we will split the upright diamond into left triangle and right triangles , evaluate these separately and then sum them up : @xmath133    for the upright diamond , @xmath64 and @xmath134 , so from we have @xmath135 . with this the left half of the surface integral is : @xmath136 dx \\\\ &",

    "the upright diamond area integral is solely due to electric field .",
    "however , after the boost , it gets a magnetic contribution .",
    "the ratio of the electric and magnetic contributions depends on the magnitude of the boost @xmath140 .",
    "one can calculate the electric and magnetic contributions separately . denoting the aharonov - bohm phase due to electric and magnetic field as @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively",
    ", one can derive ( see appendix ) @xmath143    the ratio only depends on @xmath140 . at any speed",
    "less then @xmath109 , the electric contribution is larger .",
    "this is the reverse of what was found in reference @xcite , under different conditions . in @xcite , the time dependent system was an infinite solenoid with a magnetic flux which was pulsed on over a short time . in this case , the magnetic aharonov - bohm phase was dominant over the phase shift due to the electric aharonov - bohm phase . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the case of an infinite solenoid with a slowly varying flux was considered . to linear order it was found that the electric and magnetic aharonov - bohm phase shifts were of equal magnitude but opposite sign and thus canceled .",
    "for the case of the electromagnetic wave , the magnetic contribution becomes equal to the electric contribution only when the particles travel at the speed of light .",
    "when they travel at @xmath109 _ against _ the waves , the two contributions add up ; when they travel at @xmath109 along the waves -  riding on the waves \" - the two contributions cancel completely and result in a zero time - dependent aharonov - bohm phase , as derived in section iii . in both cases , due to relativistic constraint ,",
    "@xmath112 as @xmath111 .",
    "this behavior is different from the case of the solenoid , where reversing the magnetic field of the solenoid also reverses the direction of the electric field .",
    "thus , in the case of the solenoid , one has the same result whether the magnetic field points along the @xmath12 or @xmath10 direction . in contrast",
    ", reversing the direction of the electromagnetic wave only reverses the direction of one of the fields , so , in one case , the electric and magnetic contributions add up , while in the other case , the electric and magnetic contributions tend to cancel .    using either the area integral of the fields or the line integral of the potentials , the aharonov - bohm phase picked up in going around the space - time loop in figure is @xmath144 ~.\\ ] ]    we now recall the expansion of the term in square bracket from , in terms of @xmath145 , and apply this to to give the aharonov - bohm phase up to @xmath146 as @xmath147 from the above equation , we can see that in order for the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect to be observable , one wants to have @xmath148 in writing we have ignored the factor of @xmath149 and assumed that @xmath150 , which would be the case if @xmath151 and @xmath152 were sinusoidal .",
    "we now investigate a few different scenarios for the condition in . in regard to the spatial size of our loop , we could follow @xcite and estimate that @xmath153 , and take the speed of our particless to be non - relativistic with @xmath154 . thus , from",
    ", we have @xmath155 . under these assumptions",
    ", the condition in has two free parameters : @xmath7 and @xmath54 . combining all this , the condition in leads to @xmath156 for example",
    ", one could consider soft @xmath17-ray frequencies of @xmath157 hz , which would only require an amplitude of @xmath158 . as another scenario",
    ", one could consider a frequency of @xmath159 hz , which is in the infrared / optical part of the spectrum .",
    "this would correspond to the wavelength one order of magnitude less than the size of the loop considered here . for this choice of @xmath54 ,",
    "equation implies that one would need @xmath160 .",
    "in general , this sort of condition sets a certain constraint on the experimental verification of the ab phase shift : if @xmath161 is too small , the ab - phase may be too small to detect , while if it s too large the electromagnetic force that deflects the electrons from the prescribed space - time paths may be not negligible , as the energy density is @xmath162 .",
    "some of the same conclusion were reached in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the time - dependent aharonov - bohm phase of a charged particle traveling around a closed space - time loop , given in figures [ fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] , in the presence of em plane waves traveling in the @xmath163 direction and with a polarization in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "our work is a generalization of earlier works , @xcite and @xcite , in that we consider both the electric _ and _ magnetic aharonov - bohm effects and thus we are able to see the interplay between the two .",
    "in addition , we calculated the time - varying aharonov - bohm phase both in terms of the path integral of the vector potential , @xmath24 , and in terms of the area integral of the fields , @xmath164 .",
    "our overall conclusion is that the ab phase due to em plane waves vanishes under a broad range of conditions . thus one must carefully choose the parameters of the electromagnetic wave and of the loop that the electrons traverse in order to see the effect",
    "this is similar to the conclusion of the work in @xcite @xcite where the time varying aharonov - bohm phase was searched for experimentally but not observed .",
    "first , from , one finds that generally the time varying aharonov - bohm phase vanishes if the average of the wave form over the first half of the loop equals the average over the second half of the loop _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath165",
    ". second , from , we showed that expanding the time varying aharonov - bohm phase to the lowest order gave a phase with a magnitude of @xmath166 . in this long wavelength approximation ,",
    "only the second order term in @xmath167 remained - the zeroth and first order terms vanished .",
