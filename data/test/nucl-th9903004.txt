    "cluster models are useful to describe spatially correlated systems when the intrinsic cluster structures essentially are frozen and the relative and intrinsic degrees of freedom essentially are decoupled .",
    "a particular application during the last decade has been in studies of nuclear halos @xcite and the concepts developed in this connection have already penetrated in to other subfields of physics @xcite .",
    "when different clusters contain identical particles the pauli forbidden states must often be excluded .",
    "this is conceptually simple but often difficult in practise , since the proper antisymmetrization too easily spoils the advantages of the cluster description . for spatially extended systems with little overlap",
    "the details of appropriate approximations have so far been rather unimportant @xcite",
    ". however , beside the conceptual interest better treatments may be required by the need for higher accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the validity of the cluster models may be extended to less pronounced halos by an accurate treatment of the exclusion principle .",
    "the dilemma is that the cluster models become more accurate with decreasing overlap while the overlap is necessary to provide the interesting structure and the binding energy .",
    "too large an overlap destroys the fundamental decoupling of the intrinsic and relative cluster degrees of freedom , but the exclusion principle becomes important already at a smaller density overlap .",
    "the correlations displayed in two and three - body halos have attracted a lot of interest and in particular those in light nuclei .",
    "if the halo consists of one nucleon bound to a nucleus the pauli forbidden states are easily excluded by precise orthogonalization . however , already three - body systems present more difficulties and approximations are often employed .",
    "various prescriptions have so far been used in numerical calculations on halos consisting of two nucleons and a core @xcite .",
    "the simplest is to use a nucleon - core effective potential without bound states @xcite even when the nucleon then moves in a potential different from that of the identical nucleons within the core .",
    "the difference amounts in this way to an additional repulsion accounting for the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is essential that this effective potential reproduces the nucleon - core low - energy scattering properties , i.e. scattering length and effective range or even better the phase shifts as function of energy .",
    "therefore an obvious procedure @xcite is to start with a deep potential appropriate for the nucleons in the core . then construct a phase equivalent , approximate or precise , shallow or repulsive potential @xcite and compute the three - body observables of interest .",
    "the results could be compared to those obtained with the deep potential and the pauli forbidden states excluded in one way or another @xcite .",
    "this procedure must produce two sets of wave functions coinciding at large distances but differing at small distances by the additional node appearing inside the core by use of the deep potential .",
    "the idea is therefore that the short - distance behavior must be irrelevant when the cluster model provides a valid description .",
    "this conjecture was tested in three - body computations by using two potentials with the same scattering length and effective range @xcite and in two - body computations using completely phase equivalent potentials @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the consequences of using completely phase equivalent two - body potentials @xcite in three - body calculations based on the adiabatic hyperspherical approach , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the method was suggested and previously tested approximately for two neutrons and a core @xcite . in this report",
    "we shall carefully follow this prescription using phase equivalent potentials and rigorously derive the short and long - distance behavior of the all - decisive effective radial potentials .",
    "we shall consider cases when one , two or three of the two - body potentials have pauli forbidden states characterized by various quantum numbers .",
    "we begin with a brief sketch of the general method in section 2 .",
    "we then in section 3 give the characteristic properties of the constructed phase equivalent two - body potentials , where we use a simple @xmath0-wave potential as an analytical example . in section 4",
    "we derive the short and long - distance properties of the three - body adiabatic effective radial potentials . in section 5",
    "we show a number of qualitatively different numerical examples .",
    "finally section 6 contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "in the adiabatic hyperspherical method the coordinates of the three - body system are divided into the slow ( hyperradius ) and fast ( angular ) variables . the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the fast angular degrees of freedom",
    "are then calculated for fixed values of the slow radial variable .",
    "these eigenfunctions are then used as a basis for expansion of the total wave function .",
    "eigenvalues for the fast angular variables serve as adiabatic potentials for the slow radial variable .",
    "the great advantage of this basis is that it correctly reproduces the long - range asymptotic behavior of the three - body systems including the pathological efimov effect .",
    "we first introduce the usual jacobi coordinates @xcite for three particles with masses @xmath1 and coordinates @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is an arbitrary mass scale .",
    "the hyperspherical coordinates now consist of a hyperradius @xmath6 and five dimensionless angles @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 specify each of the directions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator @xmath13 can be written in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the angular momentum operators related to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 coordinates .",
    "the three - body hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the interaction between the two particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "here \\{@xmath23 } is a permutation of \\{1,2,3}. the eigenvalue problem is solved in two steps .",
    "first the slow coordinate @xmath24 is fixed and the ( always discrete ) spectrum @xmath25 and the corresponding angular eigenfunctions @xmath26 are calculated as function of @xmath27 . for this one can either use the schrdinger equation @xmath28 or the equivalent faddeev equations @xmath29 where the schrdinger wave function @xmath30 is the sum of the faddeev components @xmath31 or more precisely @xmath32 .",
    "the total wave function @xmath33 is expanded on the complete angular basis set @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath34 where the phase space factors @xmath35 and @xmath36^{-1}$ ] for convenience are extracted explicitly .",
    "the radial expansion coefficients @xmath37 are then solutions to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an anticipated three - body potential for fine tuning and the coupling terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given as @xmath42 with the angular volume element defined by @xmath43 .",
    "when all but the lowest terms are neglected we obtain the usual adiabatic approximation .",
    "the angular eigenvalues @xmath25 are therefore closely related to the adiabatic radial potentials .",
    "the behavior of these angular eigenvalues decisively determines the properties of the three - body system .",
    "we shall therefore analytically and numerically investigate @xmath25 for phase equivalent two - body potentials differing by the number of bound states .",
    "we shall especially study the asymptotic properties analytically .",
    "let us assume that a two - body system with relative coordinate @xmath44 , reduced mass @xmath45 and potential @xmath46 has at least one bound state with the energy @xmath47 and the total wave function @xmath48 expressed in terms of the radial wave function @xmath49 and the spin - angular part @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the spin , the orbital and total angular momenta , respectively , while @xmath5 here is the projection of @xmath52 on the @xmath53-axis .",
    "we then construct a new potential @xmath54 where @xmath55 are projection operators on states with the corresponding angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "thus the additional potential @xmath56 is an effective radial potential which only is active for the spin and angular momentum quantum numbers of the bound state in question .",
    "the potential @xmath57 is only missing the bound state @xmath58 of @xmath59 , but otherwise these two potentials have identical properties , i.e. they are phase equivalent with the same bound state spectrum @xcite .",
    "if desired this construction can be repeated to eliminate possible other bound states of the new potential .",
    "the series of potentials then only differ by the number of bound states .",
    "the wave function @xmath49 has the following asymptotic forms at short and large distances @xmath60 the additional term @xmath61 in eq.([pep1 ] ) diverges as @xmath62 at small distances and vanishes exponentially at large distances @xcite @xmath63    we shall in the remaining part of the present paper often consider an original potential @xmath46 with one bound @xmath0-state .",
    "this is the most important case in the practical applications for halo states and a generalization is easy and straightforward by use of eqs.([pep1 ] ) and ( [ pep2 ] ) .",
    "properties and procedure can be studied in more details in simple cases . for illustration",
    "we therefore construct an analytical @xmath0-wave potential and the corresponding solution labeled by `` 0 '' .",
    "the wave function @xmath64 must be proportional to @xmath65 at small distances and must fall off exponentially at large distances .",
    "one of the simplest functions obeying these constraints is @xmath66 which is the solution with the energy @xmath67 for the potential @xmath68 given by @xmath69\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of this potential is then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a function vanishing at least as fast as @xmath65 when @xmath65 decreases towards zero .",
    "the phase equivalent potential in eq.([pep1 ] ) has the additional term @xmath73 defined in eq.([pep2 ] ) .",
    "for the example in eqs.([wav0 ] ) and ( [ pep0 ] ) we then get @xmath74 } { \\left [ \\alpha ^{2}\\left ( \\cosh ( 2\\beta r)-1\\right ) -\\beta ^{2}\\left ( e^{2\\alpha r}-1\\right ) + \\alpha \\beta \\sinh ( 2\\beta r)\\right ] ^{2 } } \\ ; , \\label{dpep0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which only acts on @xmath0-waves and asymptotically behaves in agreement with eqs.([dpo1 ] ) and ( [ dpo2 ] ) .",
    "the different two - body potentials from section 3 should now be used in the three - body computations described in section 2 .",
    "two - body interactions are needed for the three two - body subsystems .",
    "each of these can in principle support pauli forbidden states of specific but different properties . in any case",
    "the angular eigenvalue spectrum , or equivalently the adiabatic radial potentials , is crucial for the behavior of the resulting three - body system .",
    "we shall therefore calculate , as far as possible analytically , the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the adiabatic radial potentials both for small and large @xmath24 . numerical examples for all @xmath27-values",
    "are postponed to the next section .",
    "let us assume that the original two - body potentials are of short range and finite at @xmath75 .",
    "the different angular momentum states then decouple in the three - body schrdinger equation in the small - distance limit @xmath76 . for each set of quantum numbers @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "referring to the @xmath79th set of jacobi coordinates , the angular eigenvalue equation in eq.([angular ] ) reduces to @xmath80 where @xmath81 and the potentials are kept for later use although their contributions vanish for @xmath82 .",
    "the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the spherical harmonics and the associated legendre polynomials , respectively .",
    "let us now assume that only one bound state of angular momentum @xmath77 is pauli forbidden in one of the two - body subsystems , which we choose to relate to the @xmath86-coordinate and denote by @xmath87 .",
    "the phase equivalent potential in eq.([pep1 ] ) then has an additional term @xmath88 , which for small @xmath24 contributes to eq.([schr1 ] ) as @xmath89 where we used that @xmath90 .",
    "all other partial waves remain unchanged .    the schrdinger equation in eq.([schr1 ] )",
    "is then for this particular @xmath77 modified at small @xmath27 into @xmath91 where we omitted the index @xmath87 on the coordinates and tildes indicate the new eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation is changed as if the angular momentum quantum number @xmath77 were increased by two units . for all other partial waves with @xmath77 different from the quantum number of the two - body bound state",
    "the schrdinger equation remains unchanged .",
    "the new spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by @xmath92 thus , except for the missing lowest eigenvalue , the three - body angular spectrum for the phase equivalent potential is identical to the original potential up to the first two terms in the expansion for small @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the next step is to include more than one two - body bound state in the same subsystem .",
    "if the orbital angular momenta of these states are different the three - body angular equations decouple and each of them is analogous or identical to eq.([schr2 ] ) .",
    "thus each pauli forbidden state is removed independently . on the other hand",
    "if the angular momenta are equal the procedure for one two - body bound state is repeated and two units have to be added to the corresponding @xmath77 both in eq.([schr2 ] ) and in the legendre polynomial of eq.([fct2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath95 should be substituted by @xmath96 while the spherical harmonics remain unchanged .",
    "the spectrum is again identical to that of the original potential except for the missing two lowest eigenvalues .",
    "let us now assume that more than one of the two - body subsystems have pauli forbidden states . using the phase equivalent potentials the three - body schrdinger equation for small",
    "@xmath27 then becomes @xmath97 where @xmath21 in the first summation includes subsystems with a pauli forbidden bound state of angular momentum @xmath98 .",
    "the projection operator projects on states with the angular momentum @xmath99 in the @xmath100th jacobi coordinate system . when more than one subsystem has a pauli forbidden state the different partial waves couple already in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we only maintained the conserved total angular momentum @xmath101 as an index on the solutions .",
    "the spectrum arising from eq.([schr3 ] ) can not be obtained analytically .",
    "let us then first repeate that treating each of the additional potentials @xmath88 while neglecting the others results in eq.([fct2 ] ) .",
    "thus simultaneous inclusion of more than one of these potentials related to different subsystems could be expected to move the spectrum by approximately the sum of that obtained by each of the individual treatments .",
    "the corresponding approximate wave functions are analogously obtained from eq.([fct2 ] ) with the appropriate addition of units to the angular momentum quantum numbers in the legendre polynomials . however , this is not the exact solution due to the coupling of different partial waves .",
    "if the states with @xmath102 and @xmath103 are pauli forbidden in the subsystems labeled `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' , respectively , all @xmath104 in subsystem `` 1 ''",
    "couple provided they receive finite contributions from rotation of the state with @xmath103 .",
    "thus numerical solutions are required to get the precise solutions .    a better ,",
    "still approximate , analytically obtained spectrum can be found by first solving the equation when @xmath104 differs from all three @xmath98 and all additional @xmath88 terms are neglected .",
    "the wave functions are then the usual hyperspherical harmonics",
    ". then when @xmath104 equals one and only one of the values @xmath98 we use the wave functions in eq.([fct2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath104 is equal to two or three identical @xmath98-values the legendre polynomial in eq.([fct2 ] ) has to be substituted by @xmath96 or @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum is finally found approximately by using these approximate wave functions @xmath106 and first order perturbation @xmath107 on top of the hyperspherical spectrum where one or more of the lowest levels are missing .",
    "the energy correction is then @xmath108 where again the summation is over the pauli forbidden states .",
    "this means that at most two non - zero terms are present .",
    "unfortunately it not easier to use this approximation than to compute the spectrum numerically without any approximations .    in conclusion , in the limit of small @xmath27 the original and the phase equivalent potentials have , except for the pauli forbidden eigenvalues , exactly the same spectrum of angular eigenvalues when all pauli forbidden states occur in one two - body subsystem . when more than one subsystem support pauli forbidden states the spectrum is only approximately the same for @xmath76 , again excluding the lowest - lying pauli forbidden levels .",
    "the hyperspherical spectrum is for short - range two - body potentials also obtained in the limit of @xmath109 as established previously @xcite .",
    "it is essentially equivalent to the spectrum at @xmath76 given by eq.([eig1 ] ) .",
    "however , in addition some of the angular eigenvalues diverge parabolically towards @xmath110 in a one - to - one correspondence with the bound states in the two - body subsystems .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are the hyperspherical harmonics in eq.([fct1 ] ) except for the lowest diverging levels where the structure at @xmath109 is that of two particles in a bound state while the third particle is in a continuum state relative to this two - body structure @xcite .",
    "the convergence towards the hyperspherical spectrum is faster the higher the angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "the limits are reached at distances comparable to the effective ranges of the two - body interactions @xcite with the crucial exception of @xmath0-waves , where the two - body scattering lengths define the distance for convergence @xcite .",
    "the different partial waves decouple in the sense that contributions to a given state from higher angular momenta are at least one order smaller in expansions in terms of @xmath111 .",
    "thus for example @xmath112-waves only receive contributions of the same order in the @xmath111 expansion from the @xmath0-waves , which in turn only receive contributions of the same order from other @xmath0-waves .",
    "these couplings are basically determined by the centrifugal barriers increasing with angular momentum .",
    "the relatively fast convergence for the higher angular momentum states isolate the @xmath0-waves as the only interesting contributors at large distances .",
    "the diverging levels are of special interest , since some of them correspond to pauli forbidden states , which must disappear by changing to the phase equivalent potentials in eq.([pep1 ] ) .",
    "in fact the goal of the present subsection is to compare the three - body angular eigenvalues of deep and phase equivalent two - body potentials differing only by the number of bound states .",
    "this should then allow us to design a prescription for removing pauli forbidden states at large distance .",
    "the necessary subsequent connection from small to large distances requires knowledge of the approach to the asymptotic behavior , i.e. at least a minimum of information about rate of convergence and wave function decomposition during the approach . here",
    "the @xmath0-waves are crucial and we shall therefore derive a number of characteristic features at large distances , i.e. corresponding to distances @xmath27 simultaneously outside the effective ranges of all the two - body interactions .",
    "these properties are revealed by use of the zero - range potentials with the related analytical solutions .    for short - range potentials and large distances the faddeev equations are more convenient than the schrdinger equation .",
    "we therefore start with eq.([angfad ] ) for @xmath0-waves , which means that the partial angular momenta @xmath113 in all three jacobi coordinates .",
    "we choose the system labeled @xmath87 and transform the other two faddeev components into this system , project out the @xmath0-wave components and multiply by @xmath114 .",
    "the wave function resulting from @xmath30 after these operations is denoted by @xmath115 and from eq.([angfad ] ) we then obtain the equation of motion as @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the parity of the permutation @xmath119 while @xmath5 and @xmath120 are the normalization mass @xmath5 and the reduced mass , respectively . the last term in eq.([fad2 ] ) arises from the transformation of the two faddeev components different from @xmath87 , see for example @xcite .",
    "a complete solution for square well potentials can be found in @xcite .    for large distances and short - range potentials",
    "@xmath20 vanish when @xmath121 is much larger than the largest effective range of the potentials divided by @xmath27 . in this region the free solution",
    "is obtained for each faddeev component @xmath31 . in the remaining vanishingly small region of @xmath121-space around @xmath122",
    "the potential @xmath20 contributes . in the region of small @xmath121",
    "the integral in the function @xmath123 in eq.([fad2 ] ) can be expanded in terms of @xmath121 . to first order",
    "we then obtain @xmath124 for large distances @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the range of the potential @xmath127 , the solution to eq.([fad1 ] ) in the @xmath121-region , @xmath128 , is the free solution @xmath129 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is constant .",
    "the structure of this solution is by definition independent of the potentials .",
    "the wave function @xmath131 in eq.([limit ] ) is then given by eq.([sin ] ) , since the argument @xmath132 is finite .",
    "increasing the parameter @xmath24 in eq.([fad1 ] ) effectively decreases the range and increases the strength of the potential and thus the zero - range limit is approached .",
    "the related eigenvalue problem can then be reformulated in the limit @xmath133 for zero - range potentials .",
    "for @xmath134 and @xmath135 eq.([fad1 ] ) is approximately given as @xmath136 and for @xmath137 the potential vanishes .",
    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath123 then arises by adding the three equations in eq.([fad3 ] ) .",
    "the singular points are @xmath138 or @xmath139 and the boundary conditions for these zero - range potentials are then expressed in terms of the two - body scattering lengths @xmath140 as @xmath141 _ { x_i = 0 } = \\frac{1 } { { a}_{i } } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ; \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\phi_{n}^{(i ) } } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\alpha_i }   \\phi _ { n}^{(i ) }   \\right ] _ { \\alpha_i = 0 }   = \\frac{\\rho } { \\widetilde{a}_{i } }     \\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ; i=1,2,3 \\;,\\ ] ] where we define the modified scattering lengths by @xmath142 .",

    "[ fig2 ] numerical examples for realistic @xmath0-wave potentials for three - body calculations of @xmath172li+n+n , where we assume spin - zero for the @xmath172li - core . with three - body interactions for fine tuning these potentials",
    "all produce a @xmath173li structure in agreement with measurements . by construction",
    "the @xmath0-wave phase shifts for the deep and phase equivalent potentials are identical for all energies , and indistinguishible from those of the shallow potential for energies below 15 mev .",
    "the two spectra arising from the truly phase equivalent potentials , ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , are again almost indistinguishable although they differ slightly more at small and intermediate distances than those in fig .",
    "otherwise the features of the schematic potential remain for these two potentials . on the other hand",
    "the spectrum from potential ( iii ) differs qualitatively from the other two spectra in spite of the fact that the low - lying @xmath0-wave phase shifts are identical for all these three potentials .",
    "the hyperspherical spectrum is still for the shallow potential obtained in both limits of @xmath76 and @xmath109 , but now the lowest level starts at @xmath175 like the ( removed ) pauli forbidden level for the deep potential .",
    "the phase equivalent potential does not have any level at @xmath175 .",
    "the large - distance behavior coincide precisely for all three potentials .",
    "the angular eigenvalues are in general more smooth for the shallow potential .",
    "the different behavior at short distance must of course be reflected in different phase shifts at higher energies , but low - energy properties are only marginally influenced .",
    "for the same reason the spatially extended halo structure resulting from these three potentials can hardly be distinguished .",
    "this may also be expressed as a dominance of intermediate and large distances in the radial wave function .    the @xmath0-wave potentials used in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are realistic choices for computations of the three - body properties of @xmath173li . the @xmath0-waves are dominating for this system , but the contributions from @xmath112-waves are also necessary .",
    "these partial waves couple in the three - body computation and several new angular eigenvalues appear as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we can identify the new levels which predominantly are of @xmath112-wave character . even with these couplings the quantitative features of the three potentials are still remarkably similar with the exception of the lowest level for the repulsive @xmath0-wave potential .    we also want to compare the spectra when the @xmath112-waves dominate in the three - body structure while the pauli forbidden state still remains in one of the two - body @xmath0-wave potentials . a halo nucleus with these features",
    "is @xmath176he ( @xmath177he+n+n ) where the shallow @xmath0-wave potential for @xmath173li is substituted by a realistic repulsion .",
    "all three potentials ( deep , phase equivalent , repulsive ) are adjusted to reproduce the measured low - energy @xmath0-wave phase shifts .",
    "all three angular eigenvalue spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] when only @xmath0-waves are included .",
    "the repulsion is revealed at small distance by the increasing levels which relatively fast join the corresponding levels from the other two potentials .",
    "for the shallow @xmath0-wave potential in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the levels from the two phase equivalent potentials varied in contrast relatively fast at small distances , but the outcome is in both cases that all spectra quickly becomes very similar and at large distances completely indistinguishable .",
    "the overall quantitative agreement between these spectra is again remarkably good .    including @xmath0 , @xmath112 and @xmath178-waves in the computation",
    "produce more levels and a number of avoided crossings as seen in fig .",
    "however , the larger variation with hyperradius does not spoil the close quantitative resemblance of the three spectra .",
    "instead the agreement is actually improved due to the coupling of the different partial waves and the related avoided crossings .",
    "for example the @xmath0-wave increasing from the starting point of @xmath179 on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is now on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] quickly joining another level also originating from 32 but with higher angular momentum .",
    "thus , the angular spectra are also remarkably similar when the @xmath112-waves dominate as in realistic computations of the three - body properties of the @xmath176he system .",
    "the radial wave function is obtained from eq.([rad1 ] ) and the lowest is often carrying more than 95 % of the probability . to demonstrate the similarity of the results found by use of the different potentials it is therefore sufficient to show the lowest function @xmath180 , see fig .",
    "indeed the quantitative agreement is overwhelming and the curves are essentially indistinguishable except perhaps at the very small hyperradii ( blown up and shown in the inset ) .",
    "the slightly smaller probability around the hyperradius of 1 fm for the repulsive potential simply reflects that the effective potential is larger in this region , see fig .",
    "on the other hand the probability is already small and the difference is therefore insignificant .",
    "even these qualitatively different two - body potentials lead to very similar radial wave functions provided the phase shifts are identical . the two phase equivalent potentials produce practically the same radial wave functions for all hyperradii .",
    "we use the adiabatic expansion and the hyperspherical coordinates to solve the three - body problem for given short - range two - body potentials . when the three particles are clusters consisting of identical fermions the antisymmetrization between clusters is technically difficult and a number of different practical approximations are used . for nuclear halos the particles are often nucleons interacting with a nucleus .",
    "then this problem can be formulated as exclusion of pauli forbidden states within the nucleus from the space suspending the physical three - body states . in two - body calculations this is straightforward by direct projection but the use of phase equivalent potentials still provide an interesting alternative .",
    "we use phase equivalent two - body potentials with a different number of bound states and compare the corresponding three - body angular eigenvalue spectra .",
    "we show analytically that these spectra , or equivalently the adiabatic radial potentials , at large distances are identical to second order , except for a number of diverging eigenvalues precisely corresponding to the additional pauli forbidden two - body bound states .",
    "this limit is mathematically obtained by use of zero - range potentials and the complete analytical solution is therefore derived and discussed .",
    "we show furthermore analytically that the spectra at small distances , with precisely the same exception for the additional bound states , also are identical to second order provided only one of the two - body potentials differ in the number of bound states . when more than one of the two - body potentials differ in the number of bound states the spectra at small distances are only approximately identical .",
    "we give an estimate in perturbation theory of this relatively small deviation .    in the numerical illustrations we use schematic as well as realistic potentials for the two - neutron halo nuclei @xmath173li ( @xmath181li+n+n ) and @xmath176he ( @xmath177he+n+n ) .",
    "the bound states are for convenience assumed to be @xmath0-states and the two halo nuclei then provide tests on systems where respectively the @xmath0 and @xmath112-configurations dominate in the three - body structure .",
    "the three - body angular spectra for phase equivalent potentials are in all cases in remarkable numerical agreement also at intermediate distances .",
    "the radial wave function is finally computed for the different potentials .",
    "they turn out to be almost indistinguishable for strictly phase equivalent potentials .    however , we find a small difference at very small distances when we use an approximate two - body potential reproducing only the low - energy phase shifts without complete phase equivalence .",
    "such phenomenological potentials have often been used in practical computations of nuclear halo properties . due to the large spatial extension of halos",
    "the probability is by definition very small at small distances and the deviation is therefore insignificant for all practical purposes .",
    "we formulate a prescription to deal with the pauli principle for two - nucleon halos .",
    "assume that the two - body potentials have pauli forbidden states .",
    "we then construct and use the phase equivalent partners without these forbidden states .",
    "the difference between the three - body adiabatic potentials arising from the original and the phase equivalent two - body potentials is essentially only additional basis functions in the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion .",
    "removing these from the adiabatic basis makes the resulting adiabatic spectra asymptotically identical both at small and large distances and approximately equal as well at all the intermediate distances .",
    "the removed basis functions correspond at large distances precisely to two particles in pauli forbidden states and the third particle in a continuum state . at small distances the lowest levels of the original deep potentials",
    "correspond to identical fermions occupying the same states .",
    "removal of these terms therefore forces the particles to occupy higher - lying orbits and thereby introducing the necessary repulsion preventing violation of the pauli principle . in conclusion , this method to exclude the pauli forbidden states in a three - body system has firm mathematical and numerical foundations .",
    "it is a practical and accurate alternative to the other existing methods ."
