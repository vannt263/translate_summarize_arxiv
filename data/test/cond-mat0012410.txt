    "nonuniform growth is inherently present in a broad class of phenomena including the development of biological populations , communication networks or economic systems like incomes of persons or companies @xcite . in many cases",
    "it is obvious to assume that in a system consisting of groups or clusters of units the attachment of a new entity to one of the groups depends on the already achieved strength or size of that particular group .",
    "simon  @xcite analysed a simple model of this kind where the growth probability was proportional to the cluster size and he gave exact results for the time dependent size distribution . referring to the examples of words in a book or personal incomes simon derived a power law distribution of cluster sizes . recently , in the search for an explanation of the widely observed scale invariance of large networks like the www @xcite , the internet or power networks @xcite , scientific citation @xcite the idea of preferential growth has been applied to evolving graphs @xcite .",
    "it turned out that such graphs behave remarkably : they have `` small world '' properties @xcite and the distribution of the strength of vertices ( number of edges from or to a vertex ) is scale free , provided that the probability of linking a vertex with a new one is proportional to its strength @xcite this class of models represent a new mechanism for `` self - organized criticality''@xcite .",
    "the idea of preferential growth seems to be essential in economic systems too where clustering of companies , e.g. , according to their market seem to follow such a pattern @xcite .",
    "these models have been treated by different tools including simulations , continuum or mean field theories @xcite and exact calculations @xcite by which information has been accumulated about the asymptotic behavior and the time dependence of the global distribution functions .",
    "however , much less attention has been paid to the full time - dependent solution of the problem .",
    "the aim of the present work is to give such a solution of a particular model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the model and the quantities of interest as well as we present the basic master equation . in section iii the main steps of the full time dependent analytic solution is given and the consequences for the steady state and",

    "the question rises why are such time dependent quantities of interest since most of the asymptotic scaling behavior can be obtained with much less labor .",
    "in fact the growth models and network usually provide only a background for some dynamic process  an aspect which has not yet paid enough attention to .",
    "if there is a strong separation of time scales , i.e. , the growth is much smaller than the process itself then it is satisfactory to concentrate on the asymptotics only .",
    "this is probably the case with the internet or the www .",
    "however , in some cases such a separation of scales could be approximate only or even missing and then the importance of the full time dependence becomes apparent .",
    "we expect that in certain economic processes this will be the case .",
    "an important aspect in the asymptotic scaling is universality .",
    "similarly to other preferential growth models , our system exhibits nonuniversal parameter dependent scaling : the exponents depend on the parameter @xmath0 ( the probability of creating a new group ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the examples quoted in the introduction also show a wide variety of scaling exponents .",
    "further interesting study would be to analyse a model where this parameter @xmath0 depends on the time of the growth .",
    "the presented system is not a network , the different groups are not linked to each other .",
    "however , for a specific value of the parameter , @xmath47 , it can be interpreted as a kind of mean field network model .",
    "the clusters then denote the different nodes , and the particles are the links .",
    "the value @xmath47 means that in average in every second time step one new group and two elements are created ( in the odd time steps the new element joins to an old group and in even time steps it will create a new group . )",
    "the new group is the new node while the two new elements are the two ends of the new link , one is pointing to the old node , the other is to the new one .",
    "this case corresponds to the barabasi s network model with parameter @xmath48 which means that the new node connects to _ one _ old sites . for this particular parameter choice",
    "our results agree with them got for the barabasi s network model : @xmath49 , see eq .",
