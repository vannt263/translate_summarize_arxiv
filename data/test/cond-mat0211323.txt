    "in numerical studies of spin glasses ( sgs ) , much effort has been devoted to clarify the properties of the so - called edwards - anderson ( ea ) model  @xcite .",
    "most of these numerical works on the ea model have concentrated on the ising ea model .",
    "it is also very important , however , to clarify the properties of the corresponding heisenberg model .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that many of real sg magnets are heisenberg - like rather than ising - like in the sense that the magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite    indeed , several numerical works have been performed on the heisenberg ea model .",
    "earlier numerical studies suggested that , in apparent contrast to experiments , the isotropic heisenberg sg in three dimensions ( 3d ) did not exhibit an equilibrium sg transition at any finite temperature .",
    "@xcite this observation leads to general belief that the weak random magnetic anisotropy is crucially important in realizing a finite - temperature sg transition and a stable sg phase , which causes a crossover from the @xmath0 isotropic heisenberg behavior to the @xmath1 anisotropic ising behavior .",
    "the expected heisenberg - to - ising crossover , however , has not been observed experimentally , and this puzzle has remained unexplained .",
    "@xcite    meanwhile , a novel possibility was suggested by one of the present authors ( h.k . ) that the 3d heisenberg sg might exhibit an equilibrium phase transition at a finite temperature , not in the spin sector as usually envisaged , but in the chirality sector , i.e. , might exhibit a chiral - glass transition .",
    "@xcite chirality is a multispin variable representing the sense or the handedness of local noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration . in the chiral - glass ordered state ,",
    "the chirality is ordered in a spatially random manner while the heisenberg spin remains paramagnetic .",
    "references  @xcite claimed that the standard sg order associated with the freezing of the heisenberg spin occurred at a temperature lower than the chiral - glass transition temperature at @xmath2 , quite possibly @xmath3 .",
    "it means that the spin and the chirality are decoupled on long length scales ( spin - chirality decoupling ) .",
    "in fact , based on such a spin - chirality decoupling picture , a chirality scenario of the sg transition has been advanced , which explains the experimentally observed sg transition as essentially chirality driven  @xcite . note that the numerical observation of a finite - temperature chiral - glass transition in the 3d heisenberg sg of  @xcite is not inconsistent with the earlier observations of the absence of the conventional sg order at any finite temperature .",
    "recently , however , in a series of numerical studies on the 3d heisenberg ea model , tohoku group criticized the earlier numerical works , claiming that in the 3d heisenberg sg the spin ordered at a finite temperature and that the sg transition temperature might coincide with the chiral - glass transition temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , hukushima and kawamura maintained that in 3d the spin and the chirality were decoupled on sufficiently long length scales , and that @xmath5  @xcite , supporting the earlier numerical results .",
    "the situation in 3d thus remains controversial .    under such circumstances , in order to shed further light on the nature of the ordering in 3d",
    ", it might be useful to study the problem for the general space dimensionality @xmath6 , particularly for dimensions higher than @xmath7 . in the limit of infinite dimensions @xmath8",
    ", the model reduces to the corresponding mean - field model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the heisenberg sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model . in the case of equal weights of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the sk model is known to exhibit a single continuous sg transition .",
    "hence , in the @xmath8 limit , the order parameter of the transition is the heisenberg spin itself , with no exotic phase such as the chiral - glass phase .",
    "furthermore , the sg ordered state of the sk model is known to exhibit a hierarchical type of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , _ i.e. _ , a full rsb .",
    "then , questions which naturally arise are : ( i ) what is the lower critical dimension ( lcd ) of the sg order @xmath9 ? ( ii ) is @xmath9 the same as the lcd associated with the chiral - glass order @xmath10 ?    concerning the point ( i ) , several earlier numerical studies including the high - temperature expansion  @xcite and the numerical domain - wall renormalization - group calculation  @xcite suggested that @xmath9 might be close to four .",
    "meanwhile , anderson and pond argued that @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "first monte carlo ( mc ) simulation on the high - dimensional heisenberg ea model was performed by stauffer and binder  @xcite . by studying the temporal decay of the ea order parameter",
    ", they suggested that a finite - temperature sg order occurred in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but not in @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the 4d heisenberg ea model was studied by coluzzi by equilibrium mc simulation  @xcite . by examining the behavior of the binder ratio , she suggested the occurrence of a finite - temperature sg transition in @xmath15 in contrast to the suggestion of  @xcite",
    ". there seems to be no consensus as to the point ( i ) .",
    "the point ( ii ) above is closely related to the controversy regarding whether the spin - glass and the chiral - glass orders occur simultaneously or separately in 3d . to the authors knowledge , concerning the chiral - glass order in @xmath16 dimensions , no calculation has been reported so far . in the present paper , we wish to fill this gap .",
    "we study both the spin - glass and the chiral - glass orders of the heisenberg ea model in both 4d and 5d by means of a large - scale equilibrium mc simulation .",
    "in particular , we simulate larger lattices and lower temperatures than those covered in  @xcite . for comparison , a simulation is also performed on the mean - field heisenberg sk model corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "our data suggest that , in 5d , the model exhibits a single sg transition at a finite temperature reminiscent to the one of the heisenberg sk model .",
    "the chirality orders simultaneously with the spin , but it behaves as the composite operator of the spin , not as the order parameter .",
    "the sg ordered state in 5d accompanies a peculiar type of rsb , most probably a one - step - like rsb , which is different in character from the full rsb realized in the sk model . in 4d , by contrast , the model exhibits a pure chiral - glass transition at a finite temperature , not accompanying the standard sg order .",
    "the critical region associated with the chiral - glass transition , however , is very narrow , suggesting that the 4d model lies close to the marginal dimensionality .",
    "the chiral - glass ordered state accompanies a one - step - like rsb .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  [ secmodel ] , we introduce our model and explain some of the details of the mc calculation .",
    "various physical quantities calculated in our mc simulation are defined in  [ secphysq ] .",
    "the results of our mc simulation on the 4d , 5d and sk models are presented in  [ secresult ] .",
    "section [ summary ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the model we consider is the isotropic classical heisenberg model on a 4d or 5d hypercubic lattice , with the nearest - neighbor gaussian coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a three - component unit vector , and @xmath20 sum is taken over nearest - neighbor pairs on the lattice .",
    "the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath21 is assumed to obey the gaussian distribution with a zero mean and a variance @xmath22 .    for comparison",
    ", we also simulate the corresponding infinite - ranged model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the heisenberg sk model corresponding to @xmath8 . in the sk model ,",
    "the gaussian coupling @xmath21 works between all possible pairs of total @xmath23 spins with a zero mean and a variance @xmath24 .",
    "we perform an equilibrium mc simulation on these models . in 4d ,",
    "the lattices studied are the hypercubic lattices with @xmath25 sites with @xmath26 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , whereas in 5d , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . in the case of the sk model , @xmath23 is taken to be @xmath29 , 64 , 128 , 256 and 512 . in all cases , we impose periodic boundary conditions in all @xmath6 directions .",
    "the sample average is taken over 64 - 200 independent bond realizations , depending on the system size @xmath30 and the lattice dimensionality @xmath6 .",
    "error bars of physical quantities are estimated by the sample - to - sample statistical fluctuation over the bond realizations .    in order to facilitate efficient thermalization",
    ", we combine the standard heat - bath method with the temperature - exchange technique  @xcite .",
    "care is taken to be sure that the system is fully equilibrated .",
    "equilibration is checked by the following procedures .",
    "first , we monitor the system to travel back and forth many times along the temperature axis during the the temperature - exchange process ( typically more than 10 times ) between the maximum and minimum temperature points .",
    "we check at the same time that the relaxation due to the standard heat - bath updating is reasonably fast at the highest temperature , whose relaxation time is of order @xmath31 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) .",
    "this guarantees that different parts of the phase space are sampled in each `` cycle '' of the temperature - exchange run .",
    "second , we check the stability of the results against at least three times longer runs for a subset of samples .",
    "third , we use the method recently developed in  @xcite for the gaussian coupling , in which a certain quantity is calculated in two ways , each of which is expected to approach the asymptotic equilibrium value either from above or from below .",
    "further details of our mc simulation are given in [ table - mcparam ] .",
    "in this section , we define various physical quantities calculated in our simulation below .      by considering two independent systems ( `` replicas '' ) described by the same hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamil ] )",
    ", one can define an overlap variable .",
    "the overlap of the heisenberg spin is defined as a _",

    "i , e , _ , it is not a simple delta - function located at the ea sg order parameter @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we need to clarify first how the function @xmath49 looks like in the possible sg ordered state with a nonzero @xmath55  @xcite .",

    "the occurrence of a negative dip deepening with @xmath30 , accompanied by a crossing on the negative side of @xmath90 , is similar to the one previously observed in the corresponding 3d model  @xcite , although , in 3d , @xmath88 tends to shift toward lower temperature with increasing @xmath30 .",

    "the estimated chiral - glass ordering temperature agrees within errors with the exactly - known sg transition temperature of the heisenberg sk model , @xmath103 .",
    "this coincidence simply confirms the fact that , at the sg transition of the heisenberg sk model , heisenberg spins order in a noncoplanar manner , which necessarily accompanies the onset of a nonzero chiral - glass lro .",

    "in summary , we performed a large - scale equilibrium mc simulation of the 4d , 5d and sk heisenberg spin glasses . in 5d",
    ", the model exhibits a single sg transition at a finite temperature , reminiscent to the one of the corresponding mean - field model . below the transition temperature @xmath104 ,",
    "the spin is frozen in a spatially random noncoplanar configuration .",
    "although the sg order accompanies a finite chiral - glass lro reflecting the noncoplanar nature of the spin order , the order parameter of the transition is the spin , not the chirality , and the chiral - glass susceptibility remains nondiverging at @xmath105 .",
    "similar behavior is also observed in the heisenberg sk model .",
    "the sg exponents in 5d are estimated as @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , most of which are rather close to the mean - field exponents . since the upper critical dimension of the sg",
    "is believed to be six , the observed closeness to the mean - field values seems reasonable .",
    "our data suggest that the sg ordered state accompanies a peculiar phase - space structure , namely , a one - step - like rsb , at least in its chiral sector .",
    "such a one - step - like character of the rsb is at variance with the full ( hierarchical ) rsb realized in the sk model corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "it means that the rsb pattern of the ordered state changes its nature at some borderline dimensionality , presumably at the upper critical dimension @xmath110 .    in 4d ,",
    "the model exhibits a significantly different behavior from the 5d and the sk models .",
    "bulk of our data , particularly the binder ratio , indicate that the 4d model exhibits a pure chiral - glass transition at a finite temperature @xmath111 without accompanying the standard sg order . at the chiral - glass transition",
    ", however , the spin becomes almost critical which manifests itself as a pseudo - critical phenomenon observable at short length scales .",
    "the critical region associated with the chiral - glass transition is very narrow , limited to @xmath112 , suggesting that the dimension four is close to the marginal dimensionality .",

    "our data suggest that the chiral - glass ordered state accompanies a one - step - like rsb in the chiral sector .",
    "again , such a one - step - like character of the rsb differs from the full ( hierarchical ) rsb realized in the sk model .",
    "next , we wish to compare out present results on the 4d and 5d heisenberg sgs with those of the previous authors . to our knowledge ,",
    "our results for the chiral order are new .",
    "concerning the spin order , our present conclusion , _ i.e. _ , the presence of the sg lro in 5d and the absence of it in 4d , is consistent with most of numerical simulations , in particular , with the one of stauffer and binder  @xcite .",
    "our conclusion , however , is at variance with that of coluzzi , who suggested that the sg lro set in at a finite temperature @xmath114  @xcite . although the numerical data themselves seem to be consistent between the two works , coluzzi simulated rather small lattices @xmath115 and high temperatures @xmath116 , which hampered a direct examination of the asymptotic ordering behavior . our new data for larger lattices @xmath117 and for temperatures including lower ones , @xmath118 ,",
    "have clarified that the transition occurs in the chiral sector at @xmath119 , which is somewhat lower than @xmath120 estimated in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the heisenberg spin appears to remain paramagnetic at the chiral - glass transition point on sufficiently long length scales , _",
    "i.e. _ , the transition at @xmath119 is _ not _ the conventional sg transition , but a pure chiral - glass transition .",
    "finally , we wish to discuss implication of our present result to the 3d case .",
    "the behavior of the 4d model observed in the present work is qualitatively similar to the one of the 3d model observed in @xcite , except that the behavior of the 4d model looks much more marginal .",
    "for example , the reduced chiral - glass susceptibility of the 3d model is much larger in magnitude than that of the 4d model , and the associated chiral - glass critical region is much wider in 3d than in 4d .",
    "as one judges from the size dependence of the reduced chiral - glass susceptibility shown in 3 of  @xcite , the width of the chiral critical region is about @xmath121 , which should be compared with our present estimate for the 4d model , @xmath122 .",
    "all these suggest that the spin - chirality decoupling is more eminent in lower dimensions . as the dimensionality",
    "is increased , the spin - chirality decoupling tends to be suppressed . in 4d , the spin - chirality decoupling still seems to persist , but it is limited only to a very narrow temperature region close to the transition temperature , suggesting that 4d is close to the borderline dimensionality . as the dimensionality is further increased , the spin - chirality decoupling no longer occurs .",
    "there , the order parameter of transition is the spin , not the chirality .",
    "this is indeed the case for 5d .",
    "however , at least in the case of 5d , the sg ordered state exhibits a peculiar one - step - like rsb , which differs in character from the full rsb of the @xmath17 sk model . estimated sg critical exponents of the 5d model are rather close to the mean - field values ,",
    "which is consistent with a common belief that the mean - field sg exponents arise above six dimensions .",
