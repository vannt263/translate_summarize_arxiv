    "rich clusters of galaxies , characterized optically as concentrations of hundreds ( or even thousands ) of galaxies within a region spanning several mpc , are among the brightest sources of x - rays in the sky , with luminosities of up to several @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) filling the space between galaxies has an average particle density @xmath2 @xmath3 and an electron temperature ranging from 20 to @xmath4 million k. interpreted as virial temperatures , these correspond to masses of @xmath5 @xmath6 ; rich clusters are believed to be the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe .",
    "they are also notable for their high fraction ( typically @xmath7% ) of member galaxies of early - type morphology , as compared to galaxy groups or the field . within the framework of large - scale structure theory ,",
    "rich clusters arise from the largest fluctuations in the initial random field of density perturbations , and their demographics are sensitive diagnostics of the cosmological world model and the origin of structure ( e.g. , schuecker et al .",
    "rich galaxy clusters are rare and ( including their dark matter content ) account for less than 2% of the critical density , @xmath8 , characterizing a flat universe .",
    "embedded in the icm of rich clusters  where @xmath9 of cluster metals reside  lies a uniquely accessible fossil record of heavy element creation . to the extent",
    "that the cluster galaxy stars where these metals were synthesized are representative , measurement of icm chemical abundances provides constraints on nucleosynthesis  and , by extension , the epoch , duration , rate , efficiency , and initial mass function ( imf ) of star formation  in the universe . from this perspective",
    "it is useful to take an inventory of clusters , and compare with the universe as a whole .",
    "consideration of recent results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ supports a standard cosmological model wherein , to high precision , the average matter density totals @xmath10 in a flat universe , and baryons amount to @xmath11 ( spergel et al .",
    "the estimate of fukugita , hogan , & peebles ( 1998 ) of the total density in stars , @xmath12 , is corroborated by recent constraints based on the extragalactic background light ( madau & pozzetti 2000 ) , and the two micron all - sky survey and sloan digital sky survey ( bell et al .",
    "since critical density corresponds to a mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath13 band ) @xmath14 , the cluster matter inventory compares to the universe as a whole as indicated in table 1.1 .",
    "deviations from the typical rich cluster values displayed in table 1.1 are found for both the total mass - to - light ratio and the baryonic contributions ( ettori & fabian 1999 ; mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ; bahcall & comerford 2002 ; girardi et al .",
    "2002 ; lin , mohr , & stanford 2003)indicative of differences and uncertainties in assumptions , method of calculation , and in extrapolation to the virial radius , as well as possible cosmic variance .",
    "however , it is clear that , at least to first order , observations are consistent with the theoretical expectation ( e.g. , evrard 1997 ) that these largest virialized structures are `` fair samples '' of the universe in terms of their mix of stars , gas , and dark matter .",
    "( a corollary of this is that bulge populations generally dominate the stellar mass budget in the field , as well as in clusters . ) while clusters were the first systems identified with baryon budgets dominated by a reservoir of hot gas ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) , this is now believed to apply to the universe as a whole at past and present epochs ( dav et al .",
    "2001 ; finoguenov , burkert , & bohringer 2003 ) .",
    "an important _ caveat _ is that , since rich clusters do represent regions of largest initial overdensity , star formation may initiate at higher redshift , proceed with enhanced efficiency , or be characterized by an imf skewed toward higher mass stars when compared to more typical regions .",
    "if so , there is an opportunity to search for possible variations in star formation with epoch or environment , given a suitable class of objects for comparison .",
    "the intergalactic medium in _ groups _ of galaxies may comprise one such sample .",
    "groups generally include @xmath15 member galaxies , emit at x - ray luminosities @xmath16 erg s@xmath1 , and have electron temperatures @xmath17 million k , corresponding to mass scales up to @xmath18 @xmath6 ( mulchaey 2000 ) .",
    "groups present their own unique interpretive challenges .",
    "they may not behave as closed boxes and evidently display a spread in their mass inventories , metallicities , and morphological mix of galaxies that reflect the theoretically expected cosmic variance in formation epoch and evolution ( davis , mulchaey , & mushotzky 1999 ; hwang et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , since extending consideration to the poorest groups encompasses most of the galaxies ( and stars ) in the universe , it is crucial to study the chemical composition of the intragroup , as well as the intracluster , medium .      from both scientific and practical perspectives ,",
    "x - ray spectroscopy is uniquely well suited for studying the chemical composition of the universe .",
    "most of the metals in the universe are believed to reside in the intergalactic medium ; this is demonstrably true for rich galaxy clusters ( e.g. , finoguenov et al .",
    "the concordance in mass breakdown between clusters and the universe discussed above implies that , because of their deep potential wells , clusters , unlike most , if not all , galaxies , are `` closed boxes '' in the chemical evolution sense .",
    "thus , modelers are provided with an unbiased and complete set of abundances that enables extraction of robust constraints on the stellar population responsible for metal enrichment .    for high temperatures , such as those found in the icm , the shape of the thermal continuum emission yields a direct measurement of the electron temperature , and thus the ionization state .",
    "complications arising from depletion onto dust grains , optical depth effects , and uncertain ionization corrections are minimal or absent .",
    "the energies of k - shell ( @xmath19 ) and/or l - shell ( @xmath20 ) transitions for _ all _ of the abundant elements synthesized after the era of big bang nucleosynthesis lie at wavelengths accessible to modern x - ray astronomical telescopes and instruments .",
    "the strongest icm emission lines arise from well - understood h- and he - like ions , and line strengths are immediately converted into elemental abundances via spectral fitting . of course , the quality and usefulness of x - ray spectra are limited by the available sensitivity and spectral resolution . in the following sections ,",
    "i detail how the rapid progression in the capabilities of x - ray spectroscopy drives the evolution of our understanding of intracluster enrichment and its ultimate origin in primordial star formation in cluster galaxies .",
    "new puzzles are revealed with every insight emerging from subsequent generations of x - ray observatories , a situation that will surely continue with future missions .",
    "the 6.7 kev he - like fe k@xmath21 emission line is the most easily detectable feature in icm x - ray spectra , because it arises from a high - oscillator strength transition in an abundant ion and lies in a relatively isolated wavelength region .",
    "it was first detected in the _ ariel v _ spectrum of the perseus cluster ( mitchell et al . 1976 ) , and _",
    "oso-8 _ observations of the perseus , coma , and virgo clusters ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of @xmath22 clusters ( many observed with the _",
    "a-2 _ satellite ) revealed the ubiquity of this feature at a strength generally indicating an icm fe abundance of one - third to one - half solar ( mushotzky 1984 ) .",
    "these early results demonstrated the origin of cluster x - ray emission as a thermal primordial plasma enriched by material processed in stars and ejected in galactic winds .",
    "although not immediately realized , this provided the first indications of the prodigious magnitude of galactic outflows , since the measured amount of icm fe was of the same order as the sum of the fe in all of the stars in all of the cluster galaxies .    prior to 1993 , fe was the only element accurately measured in a large number of clusters , although some pioneering measurements of o , mg , si , and s features were obtained with the solid state spectrometer and focal plane crystal spectrometer aboard the _ einstein _",

    "the fe abundance tends to be higher in clusters with the highest central densities and shortest cooling times ( see also allen & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "it is unclear from these data alone whether this is an artifact of the presence of fe gradients : since the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the gas density squared , x - ray spectra of more concentrated icm are disproportionately weighted toward the more abundant central regions .",
    "there are also systematic trends with electron temperature , with fe tending to be overabundant with respect to the average defined by the hottest clusters , for clusters with icm temperatures 2 kev @xmath25 kev , and underabundant for @xmath26 kev .",

    "1996 ; lanzetta et al . 2002 ; dickinson et al .",

    "ultimately , the two abundance stacks were merged for each temperature , and mean si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni abundances proved robust and reliable .",

    "the trend of higher @xmath21/fe ratios in the hotter clusters with lower fe / h ( fig .",
    "1.2 ) is reminiscent of trends in galactic stars and suggests the existence of icm enrichment by a stellar population that is itself promptly enriched ( i.e. by sne  ii ) , as inferred for stars in bulges and elliptical galaxies .",

    "2004 ) compare these ratios with those in various other systems , including the galactic thin ( fig .",
    "1.3 ) and thick disks , damped ly@xmath21 systems , lyman - break galaxies , and the ly@xmath21 forest . in general , the high si / fe is not out of line with other systems of comparable fe / h inferred to undergo rapid and efficient conversion of gas into stars .",
    "however , the low ratios of ca to fe and s to si , and the high ratio of ni to fe evidently are unique to the icm : a clear analog among observed classes of systems to the population responsible for enriching the icm is not evident .",
    "since bulges account for @xmath36% of the stellar mass in clusters , it is straightforward to estimate icm enrichment under standard assumptions .",
    "consider a simple stellar population with a local imf ( e.g. , kroupa 2001 ) , assume that stars more massive than 8 @xmath6 explode as sne  ii , that the rate of sn  ia explosions is as determined in nearby elliptical galaxies ( 0.16 snu , where 1 snu @xmath37 1 sn per @xmath38 solar blue luminosities per century ; cappellaro , evans , & turatto 1999 ) and injected for a duration of @xmath38 yr , and utilize sne  ii and sne  ia ( `` w7 '' model ) yields from nomoto et al .",

    ". one could achieve reconciliation for fe and si by roughly doubling the numbers of sne  ia and sne  ii , alterations that are not unreasonable since the sn  ia rate may be greater in the past and the imf may be top - heavy ( flat or bimodal ; e.g. , loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "one could then , perhaps , explain the si / fe trend with icm temperature as selective mass loss of sn  ii products in systems with shallower gravitational potential wells .",
    "however , such a scenario overpredicts s , ar , and ca and underpredicts ni .",
    "the large observed amounts of ni require a sn  ia rate , averaged over a hubble time , of more than 10 times the estimated local rate , with a concomitant decrease in the number of sne  ii to avoid overproducing fe . however , this underpredicts si .",
    "the problem is intractable using standard yields , unless a significant additional source of metals is considered .",
    "what are some possible resolutions to this puzzle ?",
    "the only explanation for the high ni abundance is a high time - averaged sn  ia rate and/or a high sn  ia ni yield ",
    "the rate must exceed @xmath78 snu , where @xmath79 is the sn  ia ni yield in solar masses . to account for those systems with high si abundances",
    ", one could assume that sn  ii si yields are twice those in the core collapse nucleosynthesis calculations currently in the literature .",
    "alternatively , the si overabundance could be explained if the number of massive sn  ii progenitor stars were approximately twice what a standard imf predicts ; but , in this case the s , ar , ca , and , perhaps , fe yields require _ ad hoc _ reduction to avoid their overproduction .",
    "if published yields are not grossly in error , one must appeal to an additional source of enrichment that preferentially synthesizes si . these progenitors must be more plentiful , or their products more efficiently retained , in more massive clusters .",
    "an extensive search of the literature reveals several instances of sne with the desired yield - pattern , including core collapse sn from very massive ( 70 @xmath6 ) stars ( thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) , massive ( @xmath80 @xmath6 ) metal - poor ( @xmath81 solar ) stars ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) , or supermassive ( with 70 @xmath6 he cores ) metal - free stars that explode as hypernovae ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "while it is unlikely that a monolithic contribution from any of these objects truly explains the icm abundance anomalies , their existence demonstrates that there are nucleosynthetic channels  likely associated with very massive and/or very metal - poor stars  that result in relative enhancements of si .",
    "figure 1.5 shows the respective contributions of sne  ia , sne  ii , and hypernovae ( heger & woosley 2002 ) to each element in a toy model that reproduces a typical rich cluster icm abundance pattern ( baumgartner et al .",

    "there are now possible signatures of population iii and hypernovae in the level and pattern of enrichment in low - metallicity milky way stars ( umeda & nomoto 2003 ) , in the level and epoch of intergalactic medium enrichment as inferred from the ly@xmath21 forest ( songaila 2001 ) , and in the reionization of the universe ( e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2003 ) .",

    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the rgs results for m87 show that , in the inner @xmath92 kpc , abundances of c , n , ne , and mg have best - fit values ( relative to anders & grevesse 1989 ) of 0.71.0 solar , with 90% uncertainties of 0.20.3 , while fe is @xmath93 solar , and o @xmath94 solar ( sakelliou et al . 2002 ) . with respect to the m87 stellar abundances ( milone , barbuy , & schiavon 2000 ) , the @xmath21 elements are apparently preferentially diluted with respect to fe .",
    "gastaldello & molendi ( 2002 ) derive detailed abundance distributions from analysis of _ xmm - newton _ epic - mos ccd data , obtaining o , ne , mg , si , ar , ca , fe , and ni in 10 radial bins extending to @xmath95 .",
    "the mos results are generally consistent with the rgs and indicate negative gradients on arcminute scales in all of the elements , with the possible exception of ne .",
    "gradients in @xmath21/fe ratios are modest .",
    "ratios with respect to fe vary among the @xmath21 elements : o / fe , ne / fe , mg / fe , and s / fe are subsolar ; si / fe , ar / fe , and ca / fe are slightly supersolar .",
    "ni / fe increases from @xmath89 solar in the center to @xmath96 solar at 50 kpc . not surprisingly , gastaldello & molendi find that no unique combination of published sn  ia ( either deflagration or delayed detonation models ) and sn  ii yields is consistent with the full abundance pattern at any radius .",
    "moreover , the combination of sn subtypes that provides the best fit varies with radius ( i.e. delayed detonation models provide a better fit in the center , w7 further out where ni / fe is greater ) .    finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) utilize a cruder spatial division , thus obtaining higher precision for individual abundances ( this is enhanced by their inclusion of _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn ccd data ) .",
    "they propose explaining the observed abundance pattern and its radial variation with ( 1 ) a radially increasing sn  ii / sn  ia ratio , ( 2 ) high si and s yields from sne  ia ( favoring delayed detonation models ) and an _ ad hoc _ reduction in sn  ii s yields , and ( 3 ) a radial variation in sn  ia yields ( corresponding to delayed detonation models with different deflagration - to - detonation transition densities ) .",
    "as they note , deflagration models must also play a role to account for the high ni / fe ratio found in other clusters .",
    "whether such a complex model can coherently explain cluster abundance patterns in general is unclear .",
    "matsushita , finoguenov , & bohringer ( 2003 ) follow this up with more sophisticated thermal modeling , and an analysis that includes individual line ratios , and they reach conclusions that are qualitatively similar in terms of the outwardly increasing importance of sne  ii , the diversity of sne  ia , and the yields of si and s.    it is important to keep in mind that these new results are for the central @xmath97 kpc  still well within the influence of the m87 galaxy .",
    "the larger - scale cluster plasma ( as studied in the acc project discussed above ) is not as profoundly affected by sne  ia , and , indeed , there are indications of a transition to a more cluster - like abundance pattern at large radii in m87 ( finoguenov et al .",
    "in fact , the narrowing redshift window when the fe in clusters must be synthesized and mixed into the icm , as inferred from the lack of fe abundance evolution , is becoming comparable to the time delay characteristic of many models of sn  ia explosions .      the era of high - precision x - ray spectroscopy has arrived .",
    "accurate and robust measurements can now be made of abundances and their variation in space and time , for a wide variety of elements in intracluster and intragroup media .",
    "this enables astronomers to utilize the icm , where metals synthesized in cluster galaxy stars over the age of the universe accumulated , as a laboratory for testing theories of the environmental dependence and impact of star formation .",
    "there are now hundreds of measurements , out to redshifts greater than 1 , of fe abundances and many tens of measurements ( or significant upper limits ) of si , s , ar , ca , and ni .",
    "the distribution function of fe abundance outside of the central regions in rich clusters is sharply peaked around @xmath24 solar , and shows no evidence of a decline with increasing redshift out to @xmath98 . with the average fe yield per current mass of stars",
    "@xmath99 times solar , a prodigious rapid enrichment is implied : a time average of @xmath100 @xmath6 yr@xmath1 of fe per ( present - day ) @xmath101 galaxy integrated over 2 gyr .",
    "this is equivalent to the nucleosynthetic yield of @xmath102 sn  ii yr@xmath1 per @xmath101 galaxy , corresponding to @xmath85 @xmath6 yr@xmath1 per @xmath101 galaxy forming stars with a salpeter imf , or @xmath103 snu of sne  ia ! as a point of reference , note that the mean star formation rate in the universe at high redshift , normalized to the cluster light , is @xmath104 @xmath6 yr@xmath1 per @xmath101 galaxy .",
    "so , despite a stellar fraction consistent with the universal average , several times the amount of metals that might be expected was synthesized in clusters .",
    "it is intriguing that lyman - break galaxies were enriched to similar levels on a comparably brief time interval . in the extreme overdense regions that represent clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the primordial imf was skewed toward high masses , or an additional separate primordial population of massive stars was present .",
    "clusters are thus strong candidates for the source of the missing metals at @xmath105 ( finoguenov et al .",
    "2003 ) , even though only about 5% of the total universal baryon content resides in clusters .",
    "centrally concentrated ( @xmath106 kpc ) excesses in fe are common , and evidently exclusively occur in those clusters that can be characterized either as cooling flow clusters , as clusters with a massive central galaxy , or as clusters without recent major merging activity .",
    "an explanation of this phenomenon awaits additional _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "results on the radial distribution of @xmath21 elements .",
    "early indications are that sne  ia play a more important role at the location of central cluster galaxies , although other giant elliptical galaxies evidently did not retain such large masses of interstellar fe .",
    "metallicity gradients evidently are mild or absent beyond these central regions .",
    "there is more si , fe , and ni than one might expect based on the observed stellar population .",
    "the relative abundances of elements measured in the icm show clear departures from solar ratios and the abundance pattern in the galactic disk and other well - studied galactic and protogalactic systems .",
    "the icm abundance pattern shows systematic variations with icm temperature ( i.e. cluster gravitational potential well depth ) .",
    "these variations are apparent even in the relative abundances , which are not generally in solar ratios , among different @xmath21 elements ( o , mg , si , s , ar , and ca ) . contribution from an additional , primordial source of metals may be required to finally explain these anomalies .",
    "the icm ni / fe ratio is @xmath107 times solar , higher than in any other known class of object where this ratio is measured . since both fe and ni are efficiently synthesized in sne  ia , and given the importance of sne  ia as fundamental probes of the cosmological world model , the origin of the ni excess is clearly worthy of further investigation .      as the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ cluster databases mature , one can expect many more measurements of abundance gradients ( of @xmath21 elements , as well as fe ) , tight constraints on the evolution of si and o abundances out to @xmath108 and fe out to @xmath29 , and additional accurate measurements of c and n. _ astro - e2 _ , scheduled for launch in 2005 , will provide true spatially resolved , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy , which will yield cleaner measurements of n , o , mg , and ne , and their gradients .    .",
