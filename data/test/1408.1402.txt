    "three - dimensional and time - dependent hydrodynamic simulations are now established as realistic descriptions for the convective photospheres of various classes of stars , and must be applied in any more precise determinations of chemical abundances , oscillation properties , or atmospheric structure .",
    "such models can now be produced for stars with widely different properties , ranging from white dwarfs to red supergiants , and with all sorts of metallicities @xcite ; fig .  1 .",
    "although , in principle , such simulations do not have freely tunable physical parameters , their complexity implies that they must apply various physical , mathematical , and numerical approximations to be manageable .",
    "such models do well reproduce the details of solar spectral line profiles as well as the fine structure ( granulation ) observed across the solar surface , its time evolution , as well as its interaction with magnetic fields .",
    "however , the verification ( or falsification ) of such models is more challenging for other stars , where surface structures can not be spatially resolved .    7  km@xmath0 for the white dwarf , and 23@xmath123  r@xmath2@xmath0 for the giant .",
    "it has become possible to model widely different stars , but the observational means for verifying such simulations remain limited , except for the sun.,width=377 ]    using the output from such simulations as temporally and spatially varying model atmospheres , synthetic spectral line profiles can be computed as temporal and spatial averages over the simulation sequence @xcite .",
    "details of the atmospheric structure and dynamics are reflected in the exact profiles of photospheric absorption lines and in their center - to - limb variations .",
    "line asymmetries and wavelength shifts originate from the statistical bias of an often greater number of [ spectrally blueshifted ] photons from hot and rising surface elements ( granules ) than from the cooler and sinking ones .",
    "center - to - limb changes depend on the relative amplitudes of horizontal and vertical velocities , whose doppler shifts contribute differently to the line broadening .",
    "these changes also depend on the amount of ` corrugation ' across the stellar surfaces : if those are ` smooth ' ( in the optical - depth sense ) , convective blueshifts should decrease from disk center towards the limb , since vertical convective velocities become perpendicular to the line of sight , and the horizontal velocities that contribute doppler shifts appear symmetric .",
    "however , stars with ` hills ' and ` valleys ' should show an increasing blueshift towards the limb , where one will predominantly see the approaching ( thus blueshifted ) velocities on the slopes of the ` hills ' facing the observer",
    ". the depth dependence of atmospheric properties causes dependences on parameters such as the line s oscillator strength , its excitation potential , ionization level , and the wavelength region . obviously , such types of spectral data could open up stellar surface structure to rather detailed observational study @xcite",
    "exoplanet transits offer a possibility to disentangle spectra from small portions across the stellar surface . during transit ,",
    "an exoplanet hides successive segments of the stellar disk and differential spectroscopy between epochs outside transit , and those during different transit phases , provide spectra of those particular surface segments that were then hidden behind the planet ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "if the planet would happen to cross a starspot , even spatially resolved spectra ( with their magnetic signatures ) of such stellar surface features could become attainable , provided sufficient spectral fidelity can be reached . knowing the precise ` background ' stellar spectrum at different disk positions , also measurements of exoplanet atmospheres during transit would be better constrained .        although the method is straightforward in principle , it is observationally very challenging since exoplanets cover only a tiny fraction of the stellar disk ( no more than @xmath31% for main - sequence stars ) .",
    "if a desired signal - to - noise in the reconstructed spectrum would be on order s / n = 100 , say , extracted from only @xmath31% of the total stellar signal , that would require a s / n in the latter on the order of 10,000 or more .",
    "this may appear daunting , but the method actually turns out to be ( at least marginally ) feasible for the brightest exoplanet host stars already with current spectrometers ( e.g. , uves on vlt ) . in the near future",
    "one can expect it to become more potent ; both because ongoing exoplanet surveys are likely to find brighter planet hosts , and because forthcoming higher - performance spectrometers ( e.g. , pepsi on lbt or espresso on vlt ) will enable such studies for also fainter and rarer stellar types .",
    "examples of synthetic spectral lines computed from co@xmath4bold models @xcite illustrate what types of signatures to expect ( figs .  3 - 4 ) .",
    "the simulations are made for a certain spatial area on the star , and run for sufficiently many timesteps , so that the output is statistically stable .",
    "spectral line profiles are then computed for each spatial location across the simulation area , for each timestep , and for different inclination angles to produce representative spatial and temporal averages for different center - to - limb positions .",
    "since such spectroscopic measures are insensitive to ( modest amounts of ) spatial smearing , they can be compared to observations with modest spatial resolution ; already spectra from a small number of center - to - limb positions will provide unique information .",

    "their contribution in one flank of the spatially averaged line also affects the intensity in the opposite flank , in contrast to gaussian - like components , whose absorption disappears over a short wavelength distance .",

    "although very many transiting planets are known , realistic targets include only such where the exoplanet is large ( jupiter - size or bigger ) and the star among the brightest hosts found so far . of course , these are the very objects of which extensive observations have been carried out in order to characterize the exoplanet and its atmosphere , and where numerous spectra are available in observatory archives . for some dozen such candidates ,",

    ", this illustrates another challenge in such reconstructions .",
    "around @xmath8  656.5 nm , some spurious ` emission ' appears .",
    "this was identifies as an artifact originating from variations in the strength of telluric water vapor lines during the several hours of transit and the period outside it .",
    "the reconstruction obtains that line profile , which is required to make its intensity - weighted summation with the observed transit profile , equal to the profile from outside transit .",
    "already a small change of telluric line strengths between the transit and out - of - transit epochs implies that the deduced spectrum from behind the exoplanet must carry all this change .",
    "since it carries only a small weight corresponding to its tiny area coverage , this spectrum must then be significantly modified to account for it all .",
    "even if water vapor effects are most prominent in the red part of the spectrum ( like here around h@xmath19 ) , this exemplifies the need to control systematic errors .",
    "strong chromospheric lines such as these balmer ones do not obtain their widths from photospheric motions , and their relative center - to - limb changes are expected to be rather smaller than for photospheric ones .",
    "a further aspect is that these strong lines are also those where some contribution from the extended atmosphere of the exoplanet may be expected .",
    "however , their large widths makes them less challenging to reconstruct , which is the reason why they were chosen for these first data samples .",
    "a somewhat narrower line is represented by the na  i  d doublet ( also studied in the context of the exoplanet atmosphere ) .",
    "its greater intensity gradients makes it more susceptible to noise , with the photometric limitations illustrated in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "the average profiles for earlier and later parts of the transit do again clearly show the stellar rotation signature with amplitude on order 5 km  s@xmath12 , consistent with rotational estimates from full - disk photospheric line broadening .",
    "the sequences in figure 11 of the ratios of successive 400-second exposures to the reference spectrum from outside transit illustrate how line profile changes can be followed during transit well above the noise level seen in out - of - transit spectra , however not by a very large margin .",
    "the pattern of stable differences in the transit spectra are believed to originate from differences in telluric water - vapor lines between the hours of transit and the times of recording out - of - transit spectra .",

    "line profile changes can be followed during the exoplanet transit ( top ) with the noise level illustrated by analogous data outside transit ( bottom ) .",
    "changes during the observing night in telluric line - strengths are believed to cause the stable ratio patterns outside the na i line.,width=340 ]    these examples show that : ( i ) already with data from existing facilities , it is feasible to reconstruct stellar line profiles from tiny portions of a stellar disk although ( ii ) for _ individual _ single lines , observed during only one transit , the very high signal - to - noise level required permits this to be done only for the broadest and strongest chromospheric ones . at these s / n levels , also close attention has to paid to possible sources of systematics , such as variable telluric absorption in some spectral regions , the stability of spectrometer calibration , of its software routines , and other .    the longer - term aim is to retrieve narrow photospheric line profiles , such as shown in figure 5 .",
    "although , with current facilities and current stellar targets , this appears not practical for _ individual _ spectral lines , it may well be possible taking advantage of the multitude of physically similar ones ( an option not available for the strong but few and mutually different chromospheric lines ) .",
    "however , already from just fe i , the visual spectrum of solar - type stars contains on the order of 1000 measurable photospheric lines , of which perhaps one half can be classified as reasonably ` unblended ' .",
    "these can then be subdivided into perhaps five groups of differently strong ones , with @xmath3100 lines per group . for lines with similar formation conditions ,",
    "their profiles are shaped in a similar fashion and the information content in their line profiles is basically redundant .",
    "thus , a suitable averaging of lines in such groups must be able to increase the data amount by a factor of @xmath3100 , correspondingly reducing the noise level .",
    "there is a requirement of sufficiently high spectral resolution but not necessarily of a very small stellar rotational velocity .",
    "even if the lines appear rotationally broadened and blended in the integrated disk spectrum , their spatially resolved reconstructions will have no such broadening .",
    "such averaging over numerous ",
    "different but physically similar  lines has been made for the solar spectrum @xcite , permitting to identify also subtle patterns of line asymmetries , otherwise hidden in noise for individual lines .",
    "work in this direction is currently in progress .",
    "as demonstrated above , retrieval of stellar spectral lines from small portions across stellar disks is feasible already with current facilities , and for current stellar targets .",
    "both of these parameters are about to change in the near future , likely offering much improved possibilities for spatially resolved stellar spectroscopy .",
    "one limiting parameter comes from the photometric noise that can be reached with existing telescopes and instruments .",
    "the data shown above originated from observations with the eso 8.2 m vlt kueyen telescope , with its uves spectrometer entrance slit opened up to 0.5 arcseconds to maximize photometric precision at the cost of spectral resolution .",
    "such a compromise was dictated by the limited brightness of the target star , hd  209458 , of visual magnitude v = 7.6 .",
    "although brighter transiting planet hosts are currently not known ( e.g. , hd  189733 , k0 v , is of a similar magnitude ) , numerous surveys are in progress or being planned , both from ground and from space , to survey brighter stars for possible exoplanet transits .",
    "this is a highest - priority activity for exoplanet studies since the possibilities for exoplanet characterization likewise are strongly dependent on the host star brightness .",
    "given the known statistics of exoplanet occurrence , it is highly likely that suitable transiting planets will soon be found around also brighter hosts .",
    "once a target star of visual magnitude v = 5 , say , is found , that will improve the signal by one order of magnitude .",
    "another limiting parameter comes from the telescope + spectrometer combination . here ,",
    "very promising developments are in progress @xcite .",
    "the pepsi spectrometer @xcite is in the process of becoming operational at the large binocular telescope with its two 8.4 m apertures .",
    "offering extended spectral coverage with resolutions @xmath8/@xmath13 up to 320,000 , this has fully sufficient performance to reveal photospheric line asymmetries and other signatures of stellar photospheric structure and dynamics of convection .",
    "also in progress is the espresso spectrometer for the combined focus of the four vlt unit telescopes of eso on paranal @xcite . observing time for such studies is virtually guaranteed since",
    "the detailed spectroscopy of exoplanets during transit of bright stars is also one of the highest - priority projects of exoplanet research , and the data required for stellar analyses will be obtained concurrently . in the somewhat more distant future , we can look forward to the proposed hires instrument at e - elt , the european extremely large telescope @xcite .",
    "this may not reach higher spectral resolution that its predecessors , but the order - of - magnitude increase in the telescope s collecting area should enable to reach also fainter and rarer stars , perhaps metal - poor , chemically peculiar and magnetically special ones .",
