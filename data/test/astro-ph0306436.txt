    "we fitted the data in the @xmath41kev energy range with the _ _ beppo__sax best - fit model ( see della  ceca et  al .",
    "2002 for details ) , composed of a soft thermal component , a `` leaky - absorber '' model ( an unabsorbed power law  +  an absorbed power law with the same photon index @xmath42 ) , and two gaussian emission lines ( at @xmath43 and @xmath44kev , respectively ) .",
    "the lecs to mecs and pds to mecs normalization factors were allowed to vary in the range suggested by the _ _ beppo__sax cookbook .",
    "the ratio of xmm-_newton _ epic - pn data to the best - fit model discussed above shows a deficit of photons at @xmath45kev , which was present but not statistically significant in the _ _ beppo__sax data ( because of the poor lecs statistics at low energies ) .",
    "this requires additional absorption in front of the soft thermal component , with a column density of @xmath46@xmath8 ( consistent with the absorption found for several seyfert  2 galaxies with circum - nuclear starbursts ; see levenson ,  weaver ,  &  heckman  2001a ,  2001b ) . with",
    "this modification the overall model proposed by della  ceca et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) well reproduces the xmm-_newton _ + _ _ beppo__sax data ; the values found for the most relevant parameters ( @xmath47@xmath8 , @xmath48 , @xmath49kev , @xmath50kev , and @xmath51 ) are in good agreement with those previously obtained .",
    "this global modelling of arp  299 is also a good fit of the xmm-_newton _ epic - pn data only , with the only exception that the presence of a gaussian line at @xmath52kev is not required .",
    "the absorbed fluxes and the intrinsic ( i.e. , unabsorbed ) luminosity are consistent with our previous results , confirming our earlier conclusion about the presence of a deeply buried agn in the system .      using only the epic - pn data , we have studied the x - ray emission produced by the two merging galaxies . their @xmath26kev band emission can be well described by a thermal component  +  a power law  +  a gaussian emission line model , with soft x - ray absorption in addition to the galactic one .",
    "apart from the energy and equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission lines ( see below ) , the best - fit parameters are very similar for the two galaxies ( @xmath53kev , @xmath54 , and @xmath46@xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore , the two galaxies contribute to the observed @xmath16kev emission of arp  299 with similar intensities .",
    "as expected , at energies lower than @xmath55kev the dominant contribution is due to the thermal emission associated with the starburst component .",
    "the luminosity of this thermal component is @xmath56ergs  s@xmath10 for ngc  3690 and @xmath57ergs  s@xmath10 for ic  694 .    in order to study the nuclear x - ray emission of ngc  3690 and ic  694",
    ", we now concentrate on the @xmath16kev energy range , where the contribution from the soft thermal component is negligible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plmod ] ( _ top panels _ )",
    "we show the ratio of the xmm-_newton _ data to a single unabsorbed power - law fit ( @xmath58 for ncg  3690 and @xmath59 for ic  694 ) ; for both of these sources , the residuals suggest the presence of linelike features at energies between @xmath60 and @xmath61kev .",
    "in fact , by adding a gaussian emission line to the simple power - law model in both cases , the fit improves significantly according to the @xmath62test ; the results of our analysis are reported in table  [ tab : xmmfit ] and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plmod ] ( _ middle and bottom panels _ ) . from our fit",
    ", the main difference between the two objects is the position and the ew of the emission lines . in the case of ic  694 ,",
    "the energy of this feature is consistent with he - like fe - k@xmath2 , while in the case of ngc  3690 the energy is consistent with fe - k@xmath2 from neutral fe .",
    "in the following section we discuss the implications of the spectral analysis previously described , focusing on the location of the deeply buried agn in this system , as we know from _ _ beppo__sax observation . because of the absorbing column density observed by _ _",
    "beppo__sax ( @xmath63@xmath8 ) , the direct x - ray continuum from the obscured agn can be see only at energies greater than @xmath64kev .",
    "so in the energy range covered by xmm-_newton _ it is completely absorbed ; the only observable and clear signature of this agn is a cold  fe - k@xmath2 line with high ew , as expected if produced by transmission through the neutral material responsible for the absorption measured by _",
    "_ beppo__sax .",
    "such a line is clearly detected in the xmm-_newton _ spectrum of ngc  3690 , strongly arguing for the presence in this galaxy of the absorbed agn inferred from the _",
    "_ beppo__sax observation .",
    "assuming that ngc  3690 produces the whole hard x - ray flux observed by the _",
    "_ beppo__sax pds , the continuum observed by xmm-_newton _ in the @xmath16kev energy range is only @xmath65 of the intrinsic one .",
    "this continuum is probably due to a combination of emission from sources related to the starburst ( e.g. , x - ray binaries ) and/or reprocessed agn emission ( reflection and/or scattering ) to our line of sight .",
    "the xmm-_newton _ data do not allow us to disentangle these different contributions .",
    "the case of ic  694 is more ambiguous , since the @xmath1kev line from highly ionized fe could be produced by a high - temperature thermal plasma .",
    "in fact , we have been able to reproduce the @xmath16kev spectrum of ic  694 ( continuum  +  line ) using a combination of a cutoff power - law model ( reproducing the integrated emission of x - ray binaries ; see persic  &  rephaeli  2002 ) and a thermal ( mekal ) model with @xmath66kev ; the two components are linked so as to reproduce the fraction of x - ray emission assigned by _",
    "chandra _ to discrete sources ( zezas  et  al .",
    "2003 ) . during the fit",
    "the slope of the cutoff power - law model was constrained to vary between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while we fixed the cutoff energy to @xmath69kev .",
    "the resulting temperature is higher than the values typically found in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , but consistent with that found , for instance , in the snr n132d by behar  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) . assuming a typical x - ray luminosity of young snrs of @xmath70ergs  s@xmath10 and a typical duration of the hot phase of @xmath71yr ( see persic  &  raphaeli  2002 for a detailed discussion on this topic ) , the measured @xmath16kev thermal luminosity of ic  694 ( @xmath72ergs  s@xmath10 ) implies about @xmath73snrs in the nuclear starburst and a supernovae rate of @xmath74yr@xmath10 ; the latter value is about a factor of @xmath38 larger than the supernovae rate estimated in the central part of ic  694 ( @xmath75 , where the bulk of the @xmath16kev emission is produced ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : chandraxmm]_b _ ) from radio and near - ir observations ( alonso - herrero  et  al .  2000)yr@xmath10 .",
    "similar results have been obtained leaving free also the slope and the cutoff energy . ] .",
    "thus , although the data do not definitively rule out the starburst origin of the emission line , this possibility implies rather extreme conditions ( number of snrs and high plasma temperature ) .    in spite of the fact that the luminosity of the fe - k@xmath2 emission line might depend on several ambient factors , a comparison with starburst galaxies showing such line can , however , supply some information about the expected line intensity .",
    "we note that among  pure \" starburst galaxies , the he - like  fe line at @xmath76kev with an ew comparable to that of ic 694 is firmly detected only in ngc  253 . in order to compare our results with those obtained with _",
    "chandra _ for ngc  253 ( weaver  et  al .",
    "2002 ) , we estimated the central ( @xmath77 ) fir luminosity of ic  694 using the radio measurement at @xmath78ghz ( taken from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty  cm [ first ] survey ) and the well - known radio / ir correlation for star - forming galaxies ( condon  1992 ) .",
    "we have rescaled the fe line luminosity of ngc  253 reported by weaver  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) using the ratio of the fir luminosities of the two galaxies , and we have found that the starburst emission could account for about @xmath79 of the observed line intensity in ic  694 .",
    "note that also ngc  253 may harbor a hidden agn , as suggested by some authors ( see , e.g. , mohan ,  anantharamaiah ,  &  goss  2002 ) .",
    "so ( as also suggested on the basis of its radio properties ; see gehrz , sramek , &  weedman 1983 ) , there is a strong possibility that in the nucleus of ic  694 , an agn may be present . in this case",
    ", the presence of an he - like  fe - k@xmath2 emission line suggests that the agn continuum could be scattered / reflected by a highly ionized gas .",
    "a similar emission line ( not accompanied by a cold fe - k@xmath2 line ) has been recently found by xmm-_newton _ in the fri galaxy ngc  4261 ( sambruna  et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "indeed we tried to model the spectrum with a reflected component as described by ross &  fabian ( 1993 ; available in xspec as a _ table _ model file ) . since the predicted continuum due to reflection by an ionized slab",
    "can be characterized by features at low energies , we considered the full @xmath26kev spectrum , adding a mekal thermal component at low energies to take into account the starburst contribution .",
    "this model accounts quite well for the entire spectrum ( @xmath80d.o.f.@xmath81 ) , and can reproduce the fe - k@xmath2 line with physically acceptable values for the main parameters : @xmath82kev , @xmath83 , and an ionization parameter , where @xmath84 is the luminosity of the continuum , @xmath85 is the numerical density ( part  @xmath86 ) of the illuminated slab and @xmath87 is the distance between the slab and the illuminating source . ]",
    "@xmath88 .",
    "the absence of a neutral fe - k@xmath2 line and the lack of any sign of absorption due to a medium with high column density indicate that the agn inside ic  694 is not heavily absorbed ( @xmath89@xmath8 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath16kev radiation is probably the direct emission of the central source , an agn of low luminosity ( @xmath90ergs  s@xmath10 ) surrounded by a cloud of highly ionized gas .",
    "the most probable reason that prevents us from identifying ic  694 as an agn from optical spectroscopic observations is the strong circum - nuclear starburst ( note that the fir luminosity is about 3  orders of magnitude greater than the x - ray luminosity of the agn , see charmandaris ,  stacey ,  &  gull  2002 ) , which could dilute its optical light ( see , e.g. , georgantopoulos ,  zezas ,  &  ward  2003 ) .    to conclude ,",
    "although a starburst origin of the x - ray emission observed in ic  694 can not be ruled out , the most plausible hypothesis to explain the x - ray data presented here seems to be the existence of an agn in each merging galaxy , one highly absorbed ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) and of high luminosity ( @xmath91ergs  s@xmath10 ) , the other one less luminous ( @xmath92ergs  s@xmath10 ) and surrounded by highly ionized gas . in order to establish the agn activity in ic  694 , hard ( @xmath93kev ) x - ray observations with angular resolution sufficient to disentangle the x - ray emission from the two galaxies would be needed .",
    "such observations are far to come ( constellation  x ) .",
    "longer and/or repeated xmm-_newton _ observations , providing information on the variability of the x - ray sources , would be at the moment the only means to test the agn hypothesis for ic  694 .",
    "this research was based on observations obtained with xmm-_newton _ , funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
