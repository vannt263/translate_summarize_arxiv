    "one of the most popular methods for numerical simulation of quantum field theories is the monte - carlo integration over all possible field configurations , with the integration weight being proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the action of the theory .",
    "however , such method might become not very efficient when the fields are strongly correlated at large distances , for example , in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions , or when the path - integral weight becomes non - positive .",
    "the latter situation is typical , e.g. , for field theories at finite chemical potential .",
    "recently it has been realized that these difficulties can be avoided or significantly reduced if one performs the perturbative expansion of the theory around some `` free '' action @xmath2 , and sums up the resulting series , instead of directly evaluating the path integral .",
    "such summation can be also performed using the monte - carlo procedure , and this alternative simulation method is usually called `` diagrammatic monte - carlo '' @xcite .",
    "diagrammatic monte - carlo turned out to be very efficient for numerous problems in statistical and condensed matter physics , and allowed to obtain many interesting results with precision which was unattainable for other methods .",
    "however , a systematic application of diagrammatic monte - carlo to field theories which are relevant for high - energy physics is so far hindered mainly because expansions in powers of coupling constant , which lead to the conventional diagrammatic technique due to feynman , typically yield only asymptotic series .",
    "such series can not be directly summed and therefore can not be sampled by a monte - carlo procedure . in practical simulations , this non - convergence problem is typically avoided by finding a suitable strong - coupling expansion .",
    "it is then argued that in a finite volume this expansion can be continued to the weak - coupling domain @xcite .",
    "examples of such expansions which were used for numerical simulations are the strong - coupling expansion in @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattice sigma - models and in abelian gauge theories , and the aizenman random current representation @xcite for the @xmath5 theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the structure of strong - coupling expansions differs significantly for different theories .",
    "moreover , in many cases they are quite complicated and their structure is not sufficiently well understood .",
    "in particular , it has not been realized yet how to systematically sample strong - coupling expansion diagrams for non - abelian lattice gauge theories or for sigma - models with @xmath6 target space .",
    "some progress in this direction has been recently achieved for field theories in the large-@xmath7 limit @xcite .",
    "another way to treat the non - convergent weak - coupling expansions has been proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a sequence of better and better approximations to the original path integral , each of which has a convergent expansion .",
    "however , so far the utility of this construction was demonstrated only for the zero - dimensional theory .",
    "it is also not clear how to generalize the construction of @xcite to lattice field theories with compact variables , such as non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "one can conclude that in the context of numerical simulations in high - energy physics diagrammatic monte carlo is so far a promising , but not a universal tool .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a novel simulation method which , on the one hand , inherits the advantageous features of diagrammatic monte - carlo , and , on the other hand , can be used to investigate theories with asymptotic weak - coupling expansions and does not require the detailed knowledge of the structure of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the method is based on the stochastic interpretation of schwinger - dyson equations , which are typically much easier to derive than the general form of the coefficients of perturbative series .",
    "such stochastic interpretation has been considered recently in @xcite for large-@xmath7 quantum field theories , and a somewhat similar approach was discussed quite a long time ago in @xcite ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the methods used in these papers ) . similarly to the `` worm algorithm '' @xcite , which is an essential ingredient in the diagrammatic monte - carlo , the method samples open diagrams which correspond to field correlators , rather than closed diagrams which correspond to the partition function of the theory .",
    "another distinct feature is that the diagrams are sampled directly in the momentum space .",
    "asymptotic series can be treated within this method using the standard resummation tools , such as the pade - borel resummation or expansion over the basis of some special functions @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of factorially divergent series , our method incorporates the borel transform ( or , more generally , the borel - leroy transform ) of the field correlators in a natural way .    in order to illustrate the applicability of our method",
    ", here we consider the theory in which schwinger - dyson equations take probably the simplest nontrivial form , namely , the theory of a one - component scalar field with quartic interaction .",
    "perturbative series in this theory are known to diverge factorially , and we use pade - borel resummation to recover physical results . as a test of the method , we study the scale dependence of the renormalized coupling constant of the theory in different space - time dimensions , and confirm numerically the triviality of the theory in five and four space - time dimensions and the instability of the trivial fixed point in three dimensions @xcite . for simplicity , we work only in the phase with unbroken @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "application of our algorithm to the phase with broken symmetry will be discussed briefly in the concluding section , and will be studied separately elsewhere .",
    "we hope that the simulation strategy , which we illustrate here on the simplest nontrivial example , can be easily generalized to other quantum field theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sds_phi4 ] we introduce the basic definitions and write down the schwinger - dyson equations for the @xmath5 theory in momentum space . in section [ sec : lineq_stochastic ] we provide a general description of the stochastic method which we use to solve these equations . then in section [ sec : stochastic_sd_solution ] we formulate the simulation algorithm which stochastically estimates the coefficients of the perturbative expansion of the field correlators in powers of the bare coupling constant . in section [ sec : series_resummation ] we consider a practical method to extract physical observables from the numerical data produced by this algorithm .",
    "while sections [ sec : sds_phi4 ] - [ sec : stochastic_sd_solution ] are essential to understand the presented method , section [ sec : series_resummation ] is more technical . in section",
    "[ sec : phys_res ] we present and briefly discuss some physical results which we obtained using our algorithm .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we make some concluding remarks and discuss further extensions and generalizations of our approach .",
    "we consider the theory of a one - component scalar field @xmath9 in @xmath10-dimensional euclidean space with quartic interaction .",
    "the action of the theory is : @xmath11 the disconnected field correlators in momentum space are defined as follows : @xmath12 note that only even - order correlators are nonzero . by @xmath13",
    "we denote the corresponding connected correlators ( that is , the correlators which contain only connected feynman diagrams ) . due to momentum conservation , all correlators also contain a factor @xmath14 .",
    "it is also convenient to define the correlators @xmath15 from which this factor is omitted .",
    "we define the renormalized mass @xmath16 and the wave function renormalization constant @xmath17 from the behavior of the two - point correlator at small momenta @xcite : @xmath18 the renormalized coupling constant @xmath19 is related to the one - particle irreducible four - point correlator @xmath20 at zero momenta . for the theory ( [ phi4_action ] ) it is proportional to the connected four - point correlator with truncated external legs : @xmath21 we note that our definition of the coupling constant differs from the one that is used in most textbooks by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "this definition is more convenient for the analysis of schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "schwinger - dyson equations for the correlators ( [ phi4_correlators_def ] ) in momentum space read :    @xmath23    @xmath24    where the arguments of the correlator in the first summand on the r.h.s . of ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] )",
    "are all the momenta except @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ".    equations ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] ) were obtained by variation of the field correlators and the action over @xmath27 .",
    "similar equations can be obtained for any argument of field correlators @xmath28 , but the resulting system of equations turns out to be redundant . to obtain a complete system of equations , it is sufficient to consider the variation over @xmath27 only .",
    "we thus arrive at a system of functional linear inhomogeneous equations for an infinite set of unknown functions @xmath29 . according to the general theorems of linear algebra",
    ", the solution of such equations is unique , if it exists .",
    "a straightforward way to solve equations ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected_n2 ] ) , ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] ) is to truncate an infinite set of equations at some correlator order and to discretize the continuum momenta . in this case , however , the required computational resources quickly grow with the number of correlators which are studied .",
    "such infinite systems of linear equations can be more efficiently solved using stochastic methods . in the next section we provide a general description of a specific stochastic method",
    "which , in our opinion , is most convenient for the solution of schwinger - dyson equations in quantum field theories .",
    "we consider a system of linear inhomogeneous equations of the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the element of some space @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes summation or integration over all elements of this space .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 are assumed to be positive , while @xmath35 can be of any sign . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are also assumed to satisfy the inequalities @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",
    "the source function @xmath38 is also assumed to be positive .",
    "factorization of the coefficients of the equation ( [ lineq0 ] ) into @xmath34 and @xmath35 is to a large extent arbitrary , and can be chosen in some optimal way for any particular problem .",
    "if the space @xmath32 in ( [ lineq_ineq ] ) contains an infinite number of elements , a deterministic approximate solution of ( [ lineq0 ] ) would require the truncation of this space to some finite number of elements , and it is _ a priori _ not known which elements can be discarded .",
    "an alternative to the deterministic solution is the stochastic solution , for which @xmath39 is proportional to the probability of occurence of the element @xmath31 in some random process .",
    "this idea dates back to the works of von neumann and ulam ( described in @xcite , see also @xcite for a more recent review ) . in this case",
    ", the solution automatically incorporates the importance sampling .",
    "namely , those elements of space @xmath32 for which @xmath39 is numerically sufficiently small are automatically truncated , since the random process can not reach them in a finite number of iterations .",
    "such methods for the solution of large systems of linear equations are widely used , e.g. , in engineering and control design , for problems related to partitions of large graphs etc .",
    "since the basic idea behind these methods is very simple , and the number of works on the subject is vast , we have decided to present here a concise formulation of the method which we found most useful , without giving any specific reference to the literature .",
    "consider the markov process with states specified by one element of the space @xmath32 and one real number @xmath40 .",
    "we specify this process by the following    [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] at each iteration , do one of the following :    evolve : : :    with probability @xmath34 change from    the current state @xmath41 to the new state @xmath31 and    multiply @xmath40 by @xmath35 .",
    "restart : : :    otherwise go to the state with @xmath42 and a random    @xmath43 , which is distributed with probability    @xmath44 .",
    "the `` restart '' action is also used to initiate the random process .",
    "the first inequality in ( [ lineq_ineq ] ) ensures that the probability of the `` evolve '' action does not exceed unity , and the second inequality ensures that @xmath40 remains bounded and thus have a well - defined average over the stationary state of the markov process .",
    "now let @xmath45 be the stationary probability distribution for this random process , that is , the probability to find the process in the state @xmath46 measured over a sufficiently large number of iterations of algorithm [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] . a general form of the equation governing the stationary probability distributions of markov processes is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the probability of transition from the state @xmath49 to the state @xmath50 . for the random process specified above such an equation",
    "reads :    @xmath51    we note that @xmath52 is the average probability of choosing the `` restart '' action .",
    "let us denote @xmath53 . by integrating ( [ lineq_markov ] ) over",
    "@xmath40 one can check that @xmath54 is the solution of the original equation ( [ lineq0 ] ) .    in practice , in order to find @xmath39 one should simulate the random process specified by the algorithm [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] , and sum up the factors @xmath40 over a sufficiently large number of iterations separately for each @xmath31 , dividing the results by a total number of iterations : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the values of @xmath31 and @xmath40 at @xmath58th iteration . here",
    "@xmath59 can be measured simultaneously with @xmath39 as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of `` restart '' actions during @xmath62 iterations .",
    "at a first sight , one can try to apply the method described in section [ sec : lineq_stochastic ] directly to equations ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] )",
    ". the space @xmath32 should be then the space of sequences of momenta @xmath63 for any @xmath64 .",
    "however , a simple analysis shows that the inequalities ( [ lineq_ineq ] ) for equations ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] ) can not be satisfied , since the number of summands in the first term on the r.h.s . of ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] ) grows linearly with the number @xmath65 of field variables in the correlator . as will become clear from what follows ,",
    "this growth is in fact the manifestation of the factorial divergence of the coefficients of the perturbative series .",
    "such structure of schwinger - dyson equations for one - component scalar field should be contrasted with scalar field theories in the large-@xmath7 limit , where the number of planar diagrams grows only in geometric progression , and where schwinger - dyson equations in factorized form at sufficiently small coupling constant can be interpreted as equations for the stationary probability distributions of the so - called nonlinear random processes @xcite .    in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "let us assume that the correlators ( [ phi4_correlators_def ] ) can be formally expanded in power series in the coupling constant @xmath66 : @xmath67where the coefficients @xmath68 will be specified later .",
    "now we insert the expansion ( [ correlators_prob_redef ] ) into the schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sd_disconnected ] ) and collect the terms with different powers of @xmath66 . this yields the following equations for the functions @xmath69 :    @xmath70    @xmath71    equations ( [ stochastic_eq_n2 ] ) and ( [ stochastic_eq ] ) are also linear inhomogeneous equations , but on a larger functional space - the unknown functions @xmath69 now depend also on @xmath72 .",
    "we can now try to choose the coefficients @xmath68 in ( [ correlators_prob_redef ] ) so as to cast these equations in the stochastic form ( [ lineq0 ] ) with coefficients which satisfy the inequalities ( [ lineq_ineq ] ) .",
    "the space @xmath32 now should contain sequences @xmath63 of @xmath73 momenta in @xmath10-dimensional space and a nonnegative integer number @xmath72 .",
    "the sum @xmath33 should be understood as summation over @xmath65 and @xmath72 and integration over @xmath65 momenta : @xmath74 thus , altogether the space of states of the markov process that we would like to construct consists of an ordered sequence of momenta of arbitrary length @xmath63 , a positive integer number @xmath72 and a real number @xmath40 .    comparing the form of equations ( [ stochastic_eq_n2 ] ) and ( [ stochastic_eq ] ) with the general form ( [ lineq0 ] )",
    ", we can now construct markov process which will solve these equations , as discussed in section [ sec : lineq_stochastic ] .",
    "again , we specify it by the following    [ alg : rp_phi4 ] at each iteration , do one of the following :    add momenta : : :    with probability    @xmath75 ,    where    @xmath76 ,    add a pair of momenta @xmath77 to the    current sequence of momenta , inserting the first momenta at the    beginning of the sequence and the second - between the    @xmath50th and @xmath78th elements of the sequence ,    where @xmath50 is chosen at random between    @xmath79 possibilities .",
    "the momentum    @xmath80 is distributed within the @xmath10-dimensional    sphere of radius @xmath81 with the probability    distribution @xmath82 .",
    "do not change    @xmath72 and @xmath40 .",
    "create vertex : : :    with probability    @xmath83    replace the three first momenta @xmath25 , @xmath84    and @xmath85 in the sequence by their sum    @xmath86 . multiply @xmath40 by    @xmath87 and increase    @xmath72 by one .",
    "restart : : :    otherwise restart with a sequence which contains a pair of random    momenta @xmath77 with the probability    distribution @xmath82 , and with    @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    since the factor @xmath87 in",
    "the `` create vertex '' action does not exceed unity , the second inequality in ( [ lineq_ineq ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let us check whether we can also satisfy the first inequality , that is , whether the total probability of `` add momenta '' and `` create vertex '' actions can be made less than one for any sequence of momenta and for any @xmath72 .",
    "this can only be achieved if both ratios @xmath90 and @xmath91 are finite for any @xmath65 and @xmath72 .",
    "for the first ratio it is only possible if @xmath68 grows not slower than @xmath92 at large @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the second ratio can only be bounded for all @xmath65 and @xmath72 if @xmath68 grows as @xmath93 at large @xmath65 , @xmath72 .",
    "we thus conclude that equations ( [ stochastic_eq_n2 ] ) and ( [ stochastic_eq ] ) indeed can be interpreted as the equations for the stationary probability distribution of some markov process , if the coefficients @xmath68 grow sufficiently fast .",
    "the factorial divergence of the perturbative series is then absorbed in the coefficients @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting that such a simple analysis of schwinger - dyson equations reveals the divergence of the perturbative series in a straightforward way , without the need to explicitly calculate any diagrams !    in algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] we have also introduced the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath81 , which is necessary in order to normalize the probability distribution of the momenta which are created when the `` add momenta '' action is chosen . in our simulations we set @xmath94 , so that all masses are measured in units of @xmath81 ( `` lattice units '' ) .",
    "a more self - consistent way to introduce such cutoff would be probably to start with lattice theory in the coordinate space and assume that all momenta belong to the first brillouin zone @xmath95 .",
    "according to the standard renormalization - group arguments , a particular choice of the cutoff prescription should result only in tiny corrections of order @xmath96 to the physical results .",
    "therefore we use the isotropic cutoff scheme , which leads to a much more efficient numerical algorithm .",
    "indeed , random momenta with isotropic probability distribution can be easily generated by the standard mapping of the one - dimensional probability distribution @xmath97 to the uniform probability distribution on the interval @xmath98 } $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , with lattice discretization in coordinate space the random momenta should be generated with the anisotropic probability distribution @xmath99 .",
    "this can be done either by using the metropolis algorithm or by discretizing the momenta , which require much more computational resources .",
    "an interpretation of our cutoff scheme in terms of feynman diagrams will be given below .",
    "algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] thus stochastically samples the coefficients of the perturbative expansion of field correlators of the theory ( [ phi4_action ] ) , which are reweighted by the factors @xmath68 .",
    "each state of the markov process defined by this algorithm corresponds therefore to some ( in general , disconnected ) feynman diagram with @xmath65 external legs and @xmath72 vertices .",
    "combinatorial growth of the number of diagrams is compensated by the growth of the coefficients @xmath68 .",
    "the action `` add momenta '' corresponds to adding a bare propagator line to the diagram , without attaching its legs anywhere - thus the number of external legs is increased by two , and the diagram order is not changed .",
    "the action `` create vertex '' corresponds to the creation of one more vertex by joining three external legs of the diagram and attaching a new external leg to the joint .",
    "the number of external legs is thus decreased by two and the order of the diagram is increased by one . since we add new momenta in pairs @xmath77 , the sum of momenta on all the external legs of any generated diagram is always identically zero .",
    "the constraint @xmath100 is thus automatically satisfied .    by a slight modification of algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ]",
    ", one can also easily trace whether the generated diagram is connected or disconnected . upon the `` add momenta '' action one should mark the two newly created legs by some unique label , and upon",
    "the `` create vertex '' action , the labels of the legs which are being joined should be replaced by a single new label . in this way , one can directly measure the four - point connected diagram which enters the definition of the renormalized coupling constant ( [ renorm_coupling_def ] ) .",
    "the `` restart '' action simply erases any diagram which was constructed before , and initiates the construction of a new diagram , which starts with just a single bare propagator . since the maximal achievable diagram order is equal to the maximal number of `` create vertex '' actions between the two consecutive `` restart '' actions , it is advantageous to minimize the probability of `` restarts '' .",
    "the rate of `` restart '' actions @xmath59 for our algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] thus plays the role similar to the reject probability in the standard metropolis - based monte - carlo : for maximal numerical efficiency it is advantageous to maximally reduce it .",
    "on the other hand , in order to implement importance sampling with maximal efficiency , the factor @xmath40 in algorithms [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] and [ alg : rp_phi4 ] should be as close to unity as possible .",
    "for each particular implementation of algorithm [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] , one should find optimal balance between the rate of `` restart '' actions and the efficiency of importance sampling by adjusting the factors @xmath35 in ( [ lineq0 ] ) .    in algorithm [ alg",
    ": rp_phi4 ] we have already chosen these factors to be @xmath87 for the `` create vertex '' action , and unity for the `` add momenta '' action . in the language of feynman diagrams ,",
    "such a prescription can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the weight of each feynman diagram is proportional to the kinematical factor @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 are independent momenta circulating in loops and @xmath104 , @xmath105 can be expressed as some linear combinations of @xmath102 and the momenta of the external legs . in algorithm",
    "[ alg : rp_phi4 ] we in fact perform monte - carlo integration over the independent momenta @xmath102 , generating them randomly and independently at the `` add momenta '' action with the probability distribution proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "our isotropic ultraviolet cutoff scheme thus consists in limiting the integrations over independent momenta @xmath102 to @xmath107 .",
    "the factor @xmath40 in algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] is then proportional to the product of propagators involving the dependent momenta @xmath104 .",
    "the weight ( [ diag_weight ] ) is obtained by averaging @xmath40 over random @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative is to perform a metropolis - like integration , with the probability of the `` create vertex '' action being proportional to @xmath108 and with @xmath40 being identically equal to one .",
    "however , we have found that such an alternative prescription increases the rate of `` restart '' actions quite significantly , and results in a less optimal performance of the algorithm .",
    "therefore , we consider only the first choice , implemented in algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] .",
    "let us now consider the coefficients @xmath68 more closely .",
    "as it was already shown , @xmath68 should grow as @xmath93 at large @xmath65 , @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath68 grow too fast , higher - order diagrams will be strongly suppressed .",
    "let us assume that @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath109 times some functions which grow exponentially with @xmath72 and @xmath65 . by minimizing the rate of `` restart '' actions for all @xmath65 at a fixed @xmath72",
    ", we find the optimal value @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we choose the following form of the coefficients @xmath68 : @xmath111 with some @xmath31 and @xmath41 .",
    "the sum of the probabilities of the `` add momenta '' and `` create vertex '' actions for such a choice of @xmath112 is : @xmath113 the maximal value of the total probability is reached for @xmath89 .",
    "minimization with respect to @xmath31 then shows that the total probability ( [ coeff_ptot ] ) does not exceed one only if @xmath114 for @xmath115 , the total probability ( [ coeff_ptot ] ) is equal to one if @xmath116 . if we set @xmath115 and @xmath117 , as we actually did in our simulations , the probabilities of both `` add momenta '' and `` create vertex '' actions do not depend on the bare mass @xmath118 or on the space - time dimensionality @xmath10 .",
    "such a choice also minimizes the rate of `` restart '' actions @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the autocorrelation time of the markov process specified by algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] also does not depend on the physical parameters of the theory ( [ phi4_action ] ) . in practice",
    ", it does not exceed several iterations .",
    "we see that our algorithm does not suffer from the critical slowing - down in the sense of the usual monte - carlo algorithms , where autocorrelation time typically strongly increases close to the continuum limit .",
    "however , this absence of critical slowing down is compensated by the increase of the computational time which is required to obtain sufficient statistics in the low - momentum region .",
    "indeed , the volume of this region decreases as @xmath119 as the infrared cutoff @xmath120 goes to zero , and hence the probability for the momenta @xmath121 to get within this region also quickly decreases .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the inclusive probabilities @xmath122 to obtain a diagram with @xmath65 legs , irrespectively of the order @xmath72 , are proportional to the borel - leroy transforms of the field correlators @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the factors @xmath123 in the perturbative expansion of the correlators are replaced by @xmath124 .",
    "thus one can say that formally algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] stochastically estimates the borel - leroy transform of field correlators for @xmath41 in the range @xmath125 .",
    "however , in order to recover physical results , one should integrate the borel - leroy transform in the range @xmath126 , therefore it is difficult to use this statement for practical calculations .",
    "a much more convenient method is to analyze the dependence of the coefficients @xmath69 on @xmath72 , as described in section [ sec : series_resummation ] .    for numerical experiments ,",
    "we have implemented algorithm [ alg : rp_abstract_desc ] as a c program .",
    "source code of this program is available at @xcite .",
    "we have used the ` ranlux ` random number generator at luxury level 2 @xcite . all numerical data",
    "to which we refer below were obtained using this code .",
    "we have set @xmath115 , @xmath117 .",
    "numerically we found that with such choice of parameters the average rate of `` restart '' actions is @xmath127 .",
    "+    in order to test the performance of algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] , we first consider zero - dimensional scalar field theory with the action @xmath128 , for which the expansion coefficients in ( [ correlators_prob_redef ] ) can be easily obtained in an analytic form . on fig .",
    "[ fig : d0series_ratio ] we plot the ratios of the expansion coefficients @xmath129 of the connected @xmath65-point functions to their exact values .",
    "these results were calculated with @xmath130 iterations of our algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] .",
    "one can see that up to approximately @xmath131 numerical results differ from exact values by less than @xmath132 , while at larger @xmath72 statistical errors become quite significant .     +    next , on fig .",
    "[ fig : order_dist ] we plot the probabilities of encountering the two- and four - point diagrams of order @xmath72 per one iteration as a function of @xmath72 for the four - dimensional theory .",
    "the label `` all momenta '' means that the diagrams were added to statistics independently of the momenta of their external legs .",
    "the label @xmath133 , where @xmath134 for the two - point diagrams and @xmath135 for the four - point diagrams , means that the diagrams were additionally weighted by the factor @xmath136 ( see also section [ sec : series_resummation ] ) .",

    "let us also note that the algorithm of @xcite significantly slows down in the weak - coupling limit @xmath242 , while the precision of our algorithm increases in this limit .",

    "a detailed study of this case will be presented elsewhere . since the possibility to interpret the bare propagator as the probability distribution of the momentum is absolutely crucial for the formulation of algorithm [ alg : rp_phi4 ] , it is not possible to set @xmath250 without modifying the algorithm .",
    "instead , one should redefine the field variable @xmath251 , where @xmath252 corresponds to one of the stable minima of the potential , and write schwinger - dyson equations in terms of the field @xmath253 , which now has the physical mass . note",
