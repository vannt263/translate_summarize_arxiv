    "its methods facilitate the determination of the macroscopic characteristics of complex nonequilibrium systems without having to exactly analyze the highly complicated individual microscopic dynamics of each constituent part . in many cases",
    "the system of interest can be separated into two distinct subsystems .",
    "one of them , which we will term the  _ dynamical subsystem _",
    " , has only few degrees of freedom , whereas the other , the",
    " _ bath _  , has , in an ideal case , the infinite number of them .",
    "the bath is a source of random perturbations ( fluctuations ) for the dynamical subsystem , also functioning as an absorber of dissipative energy .",
    "this separation is at the core of the theory of open quantum systems ( toqs ) based on papers of schwinger @xcite , developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and successfully applied to radiation damping @xcite and some problems in solid state physics @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate the applicability of toqs to the problem of spin dynamics in semiconductors , which has been extensively studied over the last decade both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite in conjunction with numerous proposals for a variety of spin - based devices @xcite .",
    "the most promising materials for device purposes , the iii - v and ii - vi compounds , have been shown to have spin relaxation rates dominated by the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism @xcite at moderate temperatures and low hole concentrations .",
    "in contrast to earlier treatments , we develop a fully microscopic stochastic theory of spin dynamics in the presence of an external magnetic field , taking account of pertinent scattering mechanisms .",
    "our analysis is based on an innovative implementation of the two step relaxation process corresponding to the relaxation time hierarchy involved in ( a ) electron thermalization , and ( b ) spin relaxation . in the first stage of solution , we determine the relaxation rates and fluctuation characteristics of electron orbital motion due to coupling to optical and acoustic phonons and random impurities as a bath .",
    "spin relaxation dynamics ( the slowest process in the system ) can be neglected in stage ( a ) .",
    "the second stage , ( b ) , proceeds with the analysis of the spin relaxation process due to spin - orbit interaction , wherein the orbital degrees of freedom are considered as an  effective heat bath  , having the characteristics determined in stage ( a ) .",
    "the orbital motion can be considered as an intermediary transmitting fluctuations from the phonon / impurity bath to electron spin , and , also , transferring the dissipated energy flow in the opposite direction .",
    "a set of bloch equations with two distinct relaxation times ( longitudinal relaxation time , @xmath0 , responsible for spin magnetic moment relaxation , and transverse relaxation time , @xmath1 , responsible for decoherence ) is derived in this second stage . in both stages of our analysis",
