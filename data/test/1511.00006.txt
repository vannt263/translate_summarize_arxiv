    "this offset drops to @xmath50 for metal poor ( @xmath30  dex ) and metal rich ( @xmath31  dex ) stars .",
    "because the majority of our stars have the typical offset , the resulting median metallicity map is only affected by a change in the absolute scale of the metallicity . as we discuss in section  [ sec : absolute - metallicities ] , absolute metallicity changes do not affect our results .",
    "the isochrone models for the bright rgb stars have a well known degeneracy between age and metallicity @xcite . to break this degeneracy we adopt a single age motivated by the literature .",

    "on one hand , the shallower metallicity gradient in old populations at large radii could be explained if an increasing fraction of stars at large radii come from smaller radii .",
    "however , radial migration also predicts that any metallicity gradient should get shallower over time , thus the similarity of the metallicity gradients in the young and old populations in the inner disk suggests that either the metallicity gradient was steeper in the past , or significant migration has not occurred in the inner disk .",

    "<S> we present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red giant branch stars in the andromeda galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> this is the first systematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20  kpc of andromeda s galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> we see a clear metallicity gradient of @xmath0 dex / kpc from @xmath1 kpc assuming a constant rgb age . </S>",
    "<S> this metallicity gradient is derived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completeness and dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects . </S>",
    "<S> the unknown age gradient in m31 s disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in our derived metallicity gradient . </S>",
    "<S> however , spectroscopic analyses of galaxies similar to m31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make this systematic error comparable to the 1@xmath2 error on our metallicity gradient measurement . in addition to the metallicity gradient , we observe an asymmetric local enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3 - 6  kpc that appears to be associated with andromeda s elongated bar . </S>",
    "<S> this same region also appears to have an enhanced stellar density and velocity dispersion . </S>"
