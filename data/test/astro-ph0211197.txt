    "magnetic fields of celestial objects can be revealed by observations of the zeeman splitting of spectral lines , of polarized dust emission at mm , submm or infrared bands , of starlight polarization due to anisotropic scattering by magnetic - aligned dust grains , of radio synchrotron emission and of faraday rotation ( see han & wielebinski 2002 ) .",
    "the first two approaches have been used to detect , respectively , the radial strength and transverse orientation of magnetic fields in the molecular clouds , with a scale length of a few pc to hundreds pc . the starlight polarization can only be used to delineate the orientation of transverse magnetic field in the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the sun within 2 or 3 kpc . the polarized synchrotron emission , if observed from nearby spiral galaxies , directly indicates the orientation of ordered magnetic field ; if observed from our own galaxy , it shows the large - angular - scale features emerging from the galactic disk due to the transverse magnetic fields , such as the north polar spur or the vertical filaments near the galactic center . the faraday rotation of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources are in fact the best probes of the galactic magnetic field on the large scale !",
    "the rotation measure ( rm ) of a source is proportional to the integration along its line of sight of the product of the radial magnetic field and electron density , @xmath3 .",
    "marvellously our galaxy is the visually largest edge - on galaxy covering all the sky .",
    "there are so many sources , either the extragalactic polarized radio sources or pulsars in our galaxy , in all directions that contain information of the field @xmath4 in all parts of the galaxy .",
    "this gives us a unique chance to study the detailed structure of the magnetic field in the galactic halo and disk , with a principle similar to the ct technology used medically .",
    "we emphasize that this is not possible for any other galaxies .",
    "the antisymmetric rm distribution of extragalactic radio sources as well as pulsars , covering all the inner galaxy , reflects the azimuthal field with reversed directions above and below the galactic plane ( fig.1 ) , entirely consistent with the field configuration of an a0 dynamo , whose origin probably lies in a dynamo in the halo ( han et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the polar field in the galactic center strongly supports this conclusion .",
    "soon after the pulsars were discovered , lyne & smith ( 1969 ) detected the linear polarization of pulsars .",
    "they noted that this `` opens up the possibility of measuring the faraday rotation in the interstellar medium '' which `` gives a very direct measure of the interstellar magnetic field '' , because the @xmath5 can be measured by pulse dispersion measure @xmath6 so that @xmath7 can be directly obtained from the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "manchester ( 1972 , 1974 ) first systematically measured a number of pulsar rms for galactic magnetic fields and concluded that the local uniform field is directed toward about @xmath9 .",
    "thomson & nelson ( 1980 ) modelled the pulsar rms and found the _ first _ field reversal near the carina - sagittarius arm .",
    "the largest pulsar rm dataset was published by hamilton & lyne ( 1987 ) .",
    "then lyne & smith ( 1989 ) used pulsar rms to further study the galactic magnetic field .",
    "they confirmed the first field reversal in the inner galaxy and found evidence for the field reversal in the outer galaxy by a comparison of pulsar rms with those of extragalactic radio sources .",
    "rand & lyne ( 1994 ) observed more rms of distant pulsars and found evidence for the clock - wise field near the crux - scutum arm .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1997 ) first noticed that the rm distribution of high latitude pulsars is dominated by the halo azimuthal field ( fig.1 ) .",
    "afterwards , any analysis of pulsar rms for the disk field was confined to the pulsars at lower galactic latitudes .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1999 ) then observed a good number of pulsar rms and divided all known pulsar rms into those lying within higher and lower latitude ranges for studies of the halo and disk field , respectively .",
    "up to now , among about 1385 known pulsars , 523 pulsars have measured values of rm observed and 365 of them lie at lower latitudes ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "one should note three important factors in the diagnosis of the large - scale field structure from pulsar rms .",
    "first , one normally assumes that the azimuthal field component @xmath11 is greater than vertical and radial components @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "this is reasonable and has been justified ( han & qiao 1994 , han et al .",
    "second , it is the gradient of the average or general tendency of rm variations versus pulsar dms that traces the large - scale field .",
    "the scatter of the data about this general tendency is probably mostly due to the effect of smaller scale interstellar structure , such as the hii regions .",
    "finally , the large - scale field structure should give coherence in the gradients for many adjacent but independent lines of sight .",
    "this can be recognized from the pulsar rm distributions ( e.g. @xmath14 near the norma arm in fig.2 ) .",
    "very recently , the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( manchester et al . 2001 ) has nearly doubled the number of known pulsars .",
    "many of the new pulsars are distant and are located near the center of the galaxy .",
    "these pulsars are unique probes for large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2002 ) recently report the detection of counterclockwise magnetic fields near the norma arm , which are _ coherent in field direction _ over more than 5 kpc along the arm .",
    "our present understanding of the structure of the _ large - scale _ magnetic field in the galactic disk is summarised in fig.2 , which is almost all revealed by pulsar rms .",
    "we conclude that based on all available information , the global field structure is best described by two distinct components : a bi - symmetric spiral field in the disk with reversed direction from arm to arm , and an azimuthal field in the halo with reversed directions below and above the galactic plane .",
    "the latter , together with a probably dipole field in the galactic center , corresponds to an a0 dynamo field configuration .",
    "pulsars are the most important probes for detection of the _ large - scale _ interstellar fields .",
