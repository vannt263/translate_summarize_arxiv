    "the interactions between trapped ultra - cold atoms govern many interesting collective quantum phenomena , ranging from bose - einstein condensation @xcite to recently observed fermion superfluid @xcite . at sufficiently low energies",
    ", it is known that short ranged atom - atom interactions can be replaced by a pointlike regularized pseudo - potential under the shape independent approximation @xcite .",
    "the strength of such a pseudo - potential is determined by a s - wave scattering length @xmath0 only , and hence one can control atom - atom interaction by tuning the scattering length via the technique of feshbach resonance . for trapped systems , the theory of pseudo - potential has been examined in details by several authors @xcite . as long as the range of the actual atom - atom interaction is short compared with the width of the trap ,",
    "low energy eigenfunctions can be accurately captured by the eigenfunctions of the pseudo - potential , except for a few tightly bound states that may exist inside the range of the inter - atomic potential .",
    "such a universal applicability is the essence of shape independent approximation .",
    "therefore the study of eigenfunctions of pseudo - potentials would provide useful insight about generic features of two - body correlations in the low energy regime .    in this paper , we address a fundamental question of how the scattering length controls quantum correlations between two ultra - cold atoms inside a harmonic trap .",
    "quantum control of trapped ultracold atoms has been a subject of considerable research interest , regarding potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "for example , collisions of atoms can be exploited to perform various quantum logic operations @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of quantum entanglement arising from s - wave scattering has not been fully explored @xcite .",
    "such an entanglement is inherent in the continuous degree of freedom of atoms , and it may have effects on the fidelity of quantum gates based upon collisional mechanisms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will analyze the quantum entanglement of the low energy eigenstates defined by the regularized pseudo - potential and the harmonic trap . by performing the schmidt decomposition of low energy eigenfunctions ,",
    "we show that quantum entanglement is manifested as pairing of atoms in a set of orthogonal mode functions in three - dimensional space .",
    "in particular , the angular momenta are identified as good quantum numbers to characterize the schmidt mode functions .",
    "we will present numerical results that quantify the degree of entanglement as a function of the scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we will examine the entanglement in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "such a strong coupling regime corresponds to the unitarity limit in degenerate quantum gases @xcite .",
    "the study of pairing in two - body models in such a limit may shed light on quantum correlations in the more difficult many body problems .",
    "to begin with , we consider a system of two interacting atoms with equal mass trapped in a spherical harmonic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the position vectors of the two atoms , @xmath5 is the mass of the atom , and @xmath6 is the trap frequency .",
    "the interaction between the two atoms is described by the short range potential @xmath7 which will be replaced by a pseudo - potential in eq .",
    "( 3 ) under the shape independent approximation . for convenience , we separate the hamiltonian into a center - of - mass part and a relative part , @xmath8 so that @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". here the energy and length are expressed in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the reduced mass ) respectively .",
    "the strength of the pseudo - potential is characterized by the modified s - wave scattering length @xmath0 . for a given inter - atomic potential ,",
    "the precise value of @xmath0 depends on the trapping potential and it can be determined self - consistently by the methods discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will treat @xmath0 as a parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "the s - wave eigen - functions of the @xmath15 have been solved analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite . given a scattering length ,",
    "the eigen - energy @xmath16 of @xmath17 is defined by the solution of : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the gamma function .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath17 with the energy @xmath16 are given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalization constant , and @xmath22 is the kummer s function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the center of mass wave function is the ground state of @xmath23 , which is a simple gaussian : @xmath24 .",
    "combining @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the two - particle energy eigenfunctions are given by @xmath27 in fig . 1 , we illustrate how the eigen - energies depend on the scattering length . for convenience",
    ", we choose to plot with the inverse of scattering length , i.e. , @xmath28 , in order to indicate the continuous branch associated with the ground states .",
    "it should be noted that the ground state energy becomes large and negative when @xmath28 is positive and large .",
    "this feature also occurs in the absence of the harmonic trapping potential , and it is due to the existence of a tightly bound state in the @xmath29 limit @xcite . as an illustration , we show in fig .",
    "2 the radial probability density associated with relative coordinate wave functions at several values of @xmath0 .",
    "the characterization of quantum entanglement is achieved by schmidt decomposition of @xmath30 , which reads : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are eigenvalues , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are schmidt eigenmodes defined by , @xmath35 note that the mode functions @xmath36 form a complete and orthonormal set , and the same is true for @xmath37",
    ". if the atom 1 appears in the mode @xmath36 , then with certainty the atom 2 must be in the mode @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , eq .",
    "( 7 ) indicates the pairing structure of the two particle state .",
    "in addition , the distribution of @xmath38 provides a measure of the degree of entanglement .",
    "this is usually discussed in terms of the entanglement entropy @xmath39 . however , a more transparent measure is the effective number of schmidt modes , which is provided by the schmidt number : @xmath40 @xcite . a disentangled ( product )",
    "state corresponds to @xmath41 , i.e. , there is only one term in the schmidt decomposition .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath42 , the higher the entanglement .",
    "we point out that @xmath43 equals the purity of the density matrix of an individual particle .",
    "the purity has also been employed as a measure of the degree of entanglement in various physical situations @xcite .",
    "to carry out the schmidt decomposition of the wave functions in three dimension , we note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore the wave function @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the legendre polynominal , and @xmath51 with the help of the addition formula : @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 this expression is already partially in the schmidt form , because the pairing of angular functions has been identified . the remaining task is to decompose @xmath54 for each @xmath55 .",
    "this can be achieved by performing the schmidt decomposition of the function @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 here the prefactor @xmath58 is introduced in order to ensure correct normalization in radial directions .",
    "the final form of the schmidt decomposition of the wave function eq .",
    "( 5 ) now reads : @xmath59\\left [ { \\frac { { v_{nl } ( r_2 ) } } { { r_2 } } y_{lm } \\left ( { \\theta _ 2 , \\phi _ 2 } \\right ) } \\right].\\ ] ] our derivation indicates a general feature that for any wave function that is a function of distances @xmath60 and @xmath61 only , the angular parts of schmidt modes are simply the spherical harmonics .",
    "the pairing involves angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 , i.e. , the same @xmath55 and opposite @xmath5 must be paired .",
    "in addition , each @xmath5 is of equal weight for a given @xmath55 .",
    "therefore if one could select schmidt modes with a fixed @xmath64 and @xmath55 via projective measurement , then the resulting state is a maximally entangled state among various @xmath5 s on the projected @xmath55 manifold .",
    "the fact that the angular parts of schmidt modes can be obtained analytically reduces the computational difficulty in the original three - dimensional problem . finding @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) is a relatively simple numerical task , because @xmath56 behaves as a two - particle ( one dimensional ) wave function in non - negative @xmath68 and @xmath69 regions .",
    "specifically , we first obtain @xmath70 by performing numerical integration of ( 10 ) for discretized values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , typically with the spacing @xmath71 . for the s - wave eigenfunctions considered here ,",
    "it is sufficient to choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , where the wave functions are mainly confined . because of the symmetry properties of @xmath56 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the same real functions .",
    "therefore @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath74 can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath56 .",
    "for low energy states considered in this paper , @xmath55 up to 30 are typically sufficient in order to obtain convergent results .",
    "we can now obtain the value of @xmath42 for the state ( 13 ) from the schmidt eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath75 here @xmath76 is defined .",
    "the main result of this paper is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the values of @xmath42 are displayed as a function of the inverse of the scaled scattering length for low energy states . we notice that higher excited states generally have higher quantum entanglement .",
    "however , the ground state ( curve a ) shows a distinct behavior in the positive @xmath28 region , where we notice a sharp rise of @xmath42 as @xmath28 increases .",
    "the strong ground state entanglement in the large positive @xmath28 limit is understood as the appearance of increasingly bounded atoms .",
    "this is implied in the ground state energy curve ( a ) in fig .",
    "1 , as well as in the wave function @xmath77 shown in fig .",
    "a crude estimation of @xmath42 can be made from the analytical results of gaussian functions .",
    "for gaussian functions separable in the center of mass and relative coordinates , it is known that @xmath78 when the center of mass width @xmath79 is much wider than the width of the relative coordinate @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "here the tightly bound state corresponds to a strong localization in particle s relative distance , with @xmath80 of order @xmath0 in the @xmath81 limit .",
    "therefore @xmath82 , and hence high values of @xmath42 can be expected as in the case of gaussians functions .",
    "however , we remark that gaussian can only serve as a guide here , because the singular @xmath83 dependence in @xmath84 can not be captured by gaussians .",
    "indeed , @xmath42 depends on @xmath0 in a complicated form according to our numerical calculations .    for excited eigenstates on the branches b and c , we see an interesting feature in fig .",
    "3 that the change of quantum entanglement is only sensitive to a range of scaled scattering lengths .",
    "such a window of scaled scattering lengths is highlighted by dash lines in fig .",
    "3 , where we found that @xmath42 changes significantly with @xmath28 when @xmath85 . recalling that we are using the length unit defined by the harmonic trap , our results suggest that the s - wave interaction can appreciably affect quantum entanglement in excited states when @xmath0 is greater than or comparable with the width of a ground state particle inside the trap , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "this feature is also true for the ground state with negative scattering lengths .",
    "the structure of quantum entanglement is characterized by the distribution of schmidt eigenvalues and the schmidt mode functions . in fig .",
    "4 we show the distribution @xmath87 for the ground state with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the case of @xmath88 ,",
    "the entanglement @xmath90 is not high because of the presence of a dominant @xmath91 schmidt mode , which covers about @xmath92 probability of the state . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath93 is much higher for the @xmath89 case .",
    "this is shown in the distribution of @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "5b ) in which schmidt modes with @xmath94 and higher angular momentum number @xmath55 are involved . in other words ,",
    "the strong entanglement is mainly manifested in the angular variables .    in fig . 5",
    ", we illustrate the shape of leading schmidt modes corresponding to the ground state wave functions in fig .",
    "since the angular part are simple spherical harmonic functions , we show only the radial mode functions in the figure .",
    "apart from the fact that schmidt modes of positive scattering lengths are more attracted to the origin , the change of scattering length has small effects on the mode functions .",
    "this is in contrast to the schmidt eigenvalues , which are more sensitive to the values of @xmath0 as depicted in fig .",
    "4 .    finally ,",
    "let us discuss the limit of @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "in such a limit , we find that the eigenfunctions take simple analytic forms .",
    "we present some of the s - wave eigenfunctions of @xmath15 in the limit @xmath95 : @xmath97 , \\\\ & & \\psi_{12 } \\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 , { \\bf r}_2 } \\right ) = \\frac{{\\sqrt { 3/2 } } } { { \\pi ^{3/2 } } } \\frac{{e^ { - r_1 ^ 2 } e^ { - r_2 ^ 2 } } } { { \\left| { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right|}}\\left [ { 1 - 4\\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right)^2 + \\frac{4}{3}\\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right)^4 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 ) correspond to the energy eigenfunctions ( center of mass @xmath98 relative coordinates ) associated with the lowest three states of @xmath17 , and the ground state of @xmath23 . although eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 ) are simple expressions , the schmidt decomposition still can not be carried out analytically .",
    "we perform numerical calculations which give : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for the wave functions given in eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 )",
    ". therefore the degree of entanglement remains finite at the infinite scattering limit .",
    "we remark that the regularized pseudo - potential method can only describe wave functions at inter - atomic distance much larger than the range of the actual inter - atomic potential @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 . inside the interaction range @xmath102 ,",
    "the actual wave functions remain finite as @xmath104 .",
    "therefore the singular behavior at @xmath105 in eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 ) is only an artifact of the shape independent approximation , and hence these wave functions should be understood for @xmath106 only .",
    "however , since @xmath102 is typically much smaller than @xmath13 ( which is about the width of @xmath107 ) , the probability of finding the two particles within the range @xmath102 is negligible @xcite .",
    "this justifies the use of the shape independent approximation here .",
    "to summarize , we present a procedure to analyze the s - wave quantum entanglement between two ultra - cold atoms in a spherical harmonic trap .",
    "the s - wave interaction is described by the regularized pseudo - potential . by performing the schmidt decomposition of low energy eigenstates",
    ", we quantify the quantum entanglement and indicate its dependence on the modified scattering length . in particular , our schmidt analysis reveals the angular correlations by showing explicitly the pairing of spherical harmonic functions . for small and positive @xmath0 , the ground states are highly entangled states , and we explain this feature as a consequence of tight binding between the atoms . for low excited states and ground states with negative @xmath0 , we find that the atom - atom interaction can only appreciably affect the entanglement when the scattering length is larger than the width of the ( non - interacting ) ground state defined by the trap",
