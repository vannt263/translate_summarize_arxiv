    "these high precision measurements were enabled by the use of curved surfaces instead of parallel planar mirrors in order to avoid the problem of parallelism .",

    "this scheme is assumed to describe the interaction for sufficiently small ratios of radius of curvature to distance .",
    "however , this an uncontrolled assumption since pfa becomes exact only for infinitesimal separations , and corrections to pfa are generally unknown .    at the other extreme , the interaction between a planar surface and objects that are either very small or at asymptotically large distance is governed by the casimir - polder potential that was derived for the case of an atom and a perfectly conducting plane @xcite .",
    "this limit has been probed experimentally with high precision for a bose - einstein condensate that was trapped close to a planar surface @xcite .",

    "so far , no theoretical prediction is available that can describe the electromagnetic casimir interaction between a compact object and a planar surface at all distances , including the important sphere - plate geometry . until recently , progress in understanding the geometry dependence of fluctuation forces was hampered by the lack of practical methods that are applicable at all separations .",
    "conceptually , the effect of geometry and shape is difficult to study due to the non - additivity of fluctuation forces .",
    "explicit consequences of this non - additivity and also non - monotonic changes in the force have been recently predicted for a pair of cylinders next to planar walls @xcite .",
