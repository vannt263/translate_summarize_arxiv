    "many polymers encountered in chemical and biological physics can be considered as long flexible chains of linear architecture . in the good solution regime , where the steric hard - core repulsions between monomers are dominant , a typical polymer chain usually attains a coil - like conformation . in this regime",
    ", the size measures of a typical @xmath2-monomer chain such as the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath3 or the mean - square radius of gyration @xmath4 obey scaling laws @xcite : @xmath5 with a universal exponent @xmath6 in three dimensions @xcite . at temperatures below the so - called @xmath7-point the polymer radius shrinks , which causes the collapse transition into the compact globule - like conformation regime .",
    "exactly at the @xmath7-temperature , the macromolecules in three dimensions behave like an ideal gaussian chain ( up to logarithmic corrections ) with size exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the conformational properties of long flexible polymer chains in the vicinity of the @xmath7-point are perfectly captured within the lattice model of self - attracting self - avoiding walks ( sasaws ) @xcite . here ,",
    "each monomer is treated as a point particle on a regular lattice , and interactions are restricted to an attractive coupling @xmath9 between non - bonded monomers @xmath10 and @xmath11 occupying nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "a subject of great interest is the study of conformational transitions of heteropolymer chains , containing monomers of essentially different chemical nature .",
    "typical examples are proteins , consisting of sequences of amino acid residues , connected by peptide bonds .",
    "one of the ways to analyze this problem is via a generalization of the sasaw model by assuming interaction energies @xmath12 of all the couples of monomers along the chain to be independent identically distributed quenched random variables ( so - called random - bond model @xcite ) .",
    "this in particular allows an analytic description of the thermodynamics of heteropolymers within the random - energy model developed by derrida @xcite for the theory of spin glasses . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a modification of this model was proposed , where the energies of different states are random variables but may take only discrete values . however , more realistic is the case where the interaction energies are determined by the underlying monomer sequence . for simplicity , we will focus on copolymers , when there are only two distinct types of monomers : @xmath13 monomers of type @xmath0 and correspondingly @xmath14 monomers of type @xmath1 .",
    "one distinguishes between the `` sequence space '' ( the set of all possible sequences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 residues along the chain ) and the  conformational space \" ( the set of all possible internal conformations of a chain due to different bond orientation , taken at fixed sequence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath15 ( fraction of @xmath0 monomers ) , so that @xmath16 @xmath17 corresponds to the limiting case of homogeneous chains with all monomers of type @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . in the following",
    "we shall focus on the following cases : @xmath18 case ( [ mod1 ] ) refers to the ( minimal ) hp model , proposed in @xcite to describe protein folding .",
    "in general , the constituents ( monomers ) of macromolecules in an aqueous environment can be characterized as hydrophilic ( polar ) or hydrophobic , depending on their chemical structure .",
    "hydrophilic residues ( @xmath1 ) tend to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules , whereas the hydrophobic monomers ( @xmath0 ) effectively attract each other and tend to form a dense hydrophobic core . despite is simplicity , this model ( and its off - lattice",
    "`` ab '' model variant ) catches the main thermodynamic features of real proteins , allowing to explore the full conformational and sequence spaces of macromolecules by powerful numerical methods , and thus still attracts attention of researchers @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics and ground - state search for various hp sequences were analyzed specifically , either representing real proteins ( e.g. , a 103-mer for cytochrome @xcite ) or just some model cases ( like fibonacci sequences @xcite ) . the largest sequence explored systematically so far is a 136mer @xcite . in general , the ability of the chain to fold into a compact state was found to be dependent both on the composition ( the fraction of residues of each type ) and on the sequence of residues .",
    "the related case ( [ mod2 ] ) is the standard model for copolymers with monomers that have a tendency to segregate @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the thermodynamic properties of copolymers ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) with correlated sequences were analyzed analytically , using an approach based on the cavity method as used in various frustrated systems .",
    "it was shown , that heteropolymers posses different dense phases depending upon the temperature , the nature of the monomer interactions , and the sequence correlation .",
    "the situation ( [ mod3 ] ) , when the like monomers repel and the opposite ones attract each other , may refer to the randomly charged model of polyampholytes @xcite : heteropolymers , comprising both positively and negatively charged monomers .",
    "typical examples of polyampholytes are synthetic copolymers bearing acidic and basic repeat groups . in general , the long - range nature of the electrostatic coulomb interaction between charged groups produces crucial effects on macromolecule properties and leads to an extremely rich conformational behavior , strongly dependent both on their overall charge @xmath19 and the quality of solvent ( and thus on temperature @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "if positive and negative charges are almost balanced ( @xmath19 is small ) , the attractive coulomb interaction dominates , and the polymer collapses into a globular ( sphere - like ) state at low temperatures .",
    "if the energy of the electrostatic interactions prevails the globular surface energy , which happens when the excess charge @xmath19 approaches @xmath21 , the molecules split into extended necklace - like conformations of small connected globules . in the high - temperature regime but small @xmath19 ( predominant electrostatic attraction ) , the pa forms globule - like structures , whereas at the critical value of the excess charge @xmath21 the charged polymer attains the shape of a neutral polymer coil . polyampholytes with considerable disbalance between positive and negative charges ( @xmath22 ) and thus predominant coulomb repulsion are expected to attain a stretched rod - like configuration . the simplified polyampholyte model with strongly screened ( short - range ) coulomb interactions in the form ( [ mod3 ] ) have been studied previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , for each @xmath23 value at fixed total length of the chain , the various possible sequences have been constructed , and quenched sequence averaging for thermodynamic observables was performed .",
    "in such a way , the phase diagram of extended and compact state coexistence has been constructed as function of both the temperature and the fraction of residues of each type .",
    "the situation ( [ mod4 ] ) may describe polyelectrolytes @xcite : heteropolymers , comprising some fraction of charged monomers of the same sign with strongly screened coulomb interactions .",
    "a transition into the compact state can not be reached for these systems .",
    "the case ( [ mod5 ] ) could be viewed as an additional generalization of above models , comprising an interplay between different kinds of short - range interactions .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to extend the picture , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the polyampholyte model ( [ mod3 ] ) to the whole range of cases ( [ mod1])-([mod5 ] ) ; namely , to treat different sequences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers at given fixed fraction @xmath23 ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) as different realizations of quenched disorder , and to obtain observables of interest after performing double conformation and sequence averaging .",
    "thus , we will obtain a systematic picture of conformational transitions from extended into compact state in models ( [ mod1])-([mod5 ] ) in the form of phase diagrams as function of the fraction @xmath23 and temperature @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , this allows us to compare the properties of hp - like models and models of charged polymers chains with strongly - screened coulomb interaction directly within the same approach .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows : in the next section ii we briefly describe the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method , applied in our study .",
    "the results obtained are given in section iii .",
    "we end up by giving conclusions and an outlook in section iv .",
    "to study the conformational properties of models ( [ mod1])-([mod5 ] ) , we apply the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite .",
    "the chain grows step by step , i.e. , the @xmath24th monomer is placed at a randomly chosen neighbor site of the last placed @xmath25th monomer ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the growth is stopped , if the total length of the chain , @xmath2 , is reached ( we consider chains of length up to @xmath27 ) .",
    "the total energy of a chain @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where each @xmath10 and @xmath11 is either of the type @xmath0 or @xmath1 , correspondingly @xmath12 is @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 depending on the model , and @xmath33 if monomers @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nearest neighbors and zero otherwise .",
    "the rosenbluth weight factor @xmath34 is thus taken to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of free lattice sites to place the @xmath37th monomer , @xmath38 denotes the energy of the @xmath37-step chain , and @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant . in what follows",
    ", we will assume units in which @xmath40 .",
    "pruning and enrichment are performed by choosing thresholds @xmath41 and @xmath42 depending on the current estimate of the sum of weights @xmath43 of the @xmath24-monomer chain @xcite .",
    "if the current weight @xmath34 of an @xmath24-monomer chain is less than @xmath41 , the chain is discarded with probability @xmath44 , whereas if @xmath34 exceeds @xmath42 , the configuration is doubled ( enrichment of the sample with high - weight configurations ) .",
    "we adjust the pruning - enrichment control such that at least 10 chains are generated per each iteration tour and perform @xmath45 tours .",
    "when studying random hereropolymers , a double averaging has to be performed to receive the quantitative value for any observable . at first , the conformational averaging is performed over an ensemble of possible conformations of a macromolecule with a fixed sequence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers for a given fraction @xmath23 value along the chain : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the weight of an @xmath2-monomer chain in a given conformation .",
    "the second is the  sequence average \" @xmath48 , which is carried out over different random sequences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers for a given @xmath23 value : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the number of different sequences and the index @xmath10 means that a given quantity is calculated for sequence @xmath10 .",
    "note , that the number of all possible sequences of an @xmath2-monomer chain at fixed fraction @xmath23 of @xmath13 monomers , given by @xmath51 becomes incredibly large with growing of @xmath2 , especially with @xmath23 close to @xmath52 . in our calculations",
    ", we consider up to @xmath53 random sequences at given fraction @xmath23 ; this , however , leads to reasonable results as is shown by comparison with some phenomenological predictions ( see below ) .",
    "note , that the case of so - called `` quenched disorder '' is considered , where the average over different sequences is taken after the configurational average has been performed .",

    "estimates for the averaged energy of heteropolymer models ( [ mod1])-([mod5 ] ) can be obtained based on the following considerations .",
    "let us introduce the averaged number of nearest - neighbor contacts @xmath54 for any monomer of a chain , which in @xmath55 dimensions can be estimated from the empirical relation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the connectivity constant ( averaged number of possibilities to make the next step in a growing saw trajectory ) .",
    "for an idealized gaussian chain , when the trajectory is allowed to cross itself , for the case of a regular @xmath55-dimensional lattice one has @xmath58 .",
    "taking into account self - avoidance effect , one first of all forbids the `` turning back '' of the trajectory at each step , which reduces the connectivity constant to the value @xmath59 .",
    "finally , another factor which reduces the connectivity constant at each step due to the self - avoidance effect , is the number of nearest sites , already visited by the trajectory ( number of contacts with nearest neighbors @xmath54 ) . having a heterogeneous polymer chain in @xmath60 with fixed fraction @xmath23 ( so that @xmath61 , @xmath62 )",
    ", we can estimate the number of @xmath63 nearest - neighbor contacts : @xmath64 the number of @xmath65 nearest - neighbor contacts : @xmath66 and the number of @xmath67 nearest - neighbor contacts : @xmath68 thus , for the total energies of models ( [ mod1])-([mod5 ] ) we have correspondingly : @xmath69    in the high - temperature regime , the steric self - avoidance effect between monomers plays the only role in determining the conformational properties of polymers .",
    "thus taken the known value @xmath70 @xcite ( which gives @xmath71 according to ( [ nn ] ) ) , we can obtain numerical estimates for ( [ en1])-([en5 ] ) .",

    "[ encoil_t ] .",
    "though for all models the polymer chains are expected to be still in an extended state ( coil regime ) at this temperature , the typical conformations they attain at given @xmath23 are governed by that nearest - neighbor contact value which minimizes the total energy . indeed , for the polyelectrolye model ( [ mod4 ] ) the most preferable configurations would be those with a small value of nearest - neighbor contacts , whereas for the hp model ( [ mod1 ] ) the largest possible value of @xmath72 will minimize the total energy .",
