    "antiferromagnetically ordered ( afm ) compounds that can undergo a phase transition to a ferromagnetically ordered ( fm ) state upon the application of an external magnetic field are referred to as metamagnets @xcite . if an external magnetic field is large enough , the magnetic moments of all unbound electrons will eventually line up with the applied magnetic field , causing a large overall magnetic moment @xcite .",

    "the structure type has recently been found to be a suitable host for exotic physical properties , such as the occurrence of structure - driven quantum critical points at @xmath6-@xmath7 phase transitions , e.g. in @xcite , or the heavy - fermionic superconductivity in @xcite .",
    "of exceptional scientific interest are the ( a = k , rb , cs ) superconductors , which also crystallize in this structure type @xcite . a close interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity has been discovered in these materials .",
    "they exhibit an antiferromagnetic ordering below @xmath0 480 k and become superconducting at @xmath8 30 k @xcite .",
    "the co - existence of these two broken states of symmetry is most likely caused by an intrinsic mesoscopic phase separation , which hosts a complex network of superconducting and antiferromagnetic domains @xcite .",
    "the coexistence and competition of magnetic and superconducting phases is a significant common feature of all iron - based superconductors ( see , e.g. , references @xcite ) .",

    "this phase has received considerable experimental and theoretical attention , because it is one of the few cobalt - based compounds with non - collinear magnetic ordering ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite ) . here , we present the magnetic properties of , a compound we find to be an a - type antiferromagnet , which displays metamagnetic field - induced transitions initiated in external magnetic fields even below @xmath10 t.",
    "all samples were prepared by high - temperature solid state synthesis , the sample handling was carried out in an argon or helium glove box under inert atmosphere .",
    "powders of cobalt ( 99.9 % purity ) and selenium ( 99.99 % purity ) were thoroughly mixed in a stoichiometric ratio , pressed to a pellet , and placed in a quartz tube .",
    "caesium ( 99.5 % purity ) was weighted into a quartz container , which was placed into the quartz tube , next to the pellet .",
    "the elements were sealed in a double - wall evacuated quartz ampoule and rapidly heated to 1000 @xmath11c for 2 h. the melt was slowly cooled down to 750 @xmath12 at the rate of 6 @xmath12/h and then cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 200 @xmath11c / h . large dark crystals with a golden lustre",
    "were obtained , which could easily be cleaved into plates with flat shiny surfaces .",
    "+   + the magnetization was studied using a _ quantum design _ magnetic properties measurements system ( mpms ) xl 7 t with a differential superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) equipped with a reciprocating sample option ( rso ) .",
    "the measurements were performed in a temperature range from @xmath13 = 5 to 300 k and in fields between @xmath14 = 0 t and 7 t. the extremely air and moisture sensitive samples were vacuum sealed in quartz ampoules of 5 mm diameter and approximately 10 cm length . in the quartz ampoule",
    "the samples were fixed between two quartz cylinders of approximately 5 cm length .",
    "such sample mounting was found to provide a stable surrounding and it produces only a minor background signal to the magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "+   + neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) experiments were carried out at the sinq spallation source at the paul scherrer institute ( switzerland ) using the high - resolution diffractometer for thermal neutrons ( hrpt ) @xcite .",
    "a wavelength of @xmath15 = 1.886   was employed , measurements were performed at @xmath16 100 k and 1.5 k. the npd experiments in magnetic fields were carried out with a superconducting magnet ( mao6 ) that can provide fields up to @xmath17 6 t with the magnetic field @xmath18 vertical to the scattering plane . the sample for the npd experiments consisted of crushed single crystals loaded into vanadium containers with an indium seal .",
    "the refinements were carried out by the rietveld method using the fullprof program integrated in the winplotr software @xcite .",
    "diffraction maxima were fitted with the thompson - cox - hastings pseudo - voigt function starting from the instrumental resolution values for the profile parameters u , v , w , and y. the symmetry analysis was performed using the isodistort tool based on the isotropy software @xcite and the basirep program @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite it is , however , higher than the previously reported value for polycrystalline samples with a @xmath0 15 k by huan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite furthermore , the additional transition at 15 k reported in reference @xcite is not observed .",
    "a transition at these temperatures was only observed for samples which were shortly exposed to air , indicating the formation of a magnetic decomposition product .",
    "+   + in order to determine the effective magnetic moment @xmath20 and the curie - temperature @xmath21 , the curie - weiss fit above the afm transition according to @xmath22 from @xmath23 300 to 150 k was performed .",
    "the effective moment is with a value of @xmath24 1.81 @xmath2/co of similar size to comparable intermetallic compounds with the same crystal structure ( see , e.g. reference @xcite ) .",
    "the positive value of @xmath25 51.0 k indicates that the nearest neighbour interaction between the magnetic moments is ferromagnetic , in contrary to the overall antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "+   +    in figure [ fig : npd_structure]a , we show the npd data of pulverized crystals at 100 k , which was collected with a wavelength of @xmath26  . as expected , most reflections of the diffraction pattern can be well explained with a structure type model with space group @xmath27 .",
    "the cell parameters are found to be @xmath28 3.842   and @xmath29 15.041   at 100 k. several additionally observed bragg reflections can not be explained solely with this structure model , or with known phases of the cs - co - se phase diagram .",
    "they can most likely be attributed to a decomposition product of the extremely air sensitive compound ( see above ) . a similar sensitivity",
    "to moisture and air has earlier been observed for the chemically closely related phases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was not possible to obtain an improved fit to the structure data with one of the -related polytypes or with a superlattice structure .",
    "a reasonable indexing solution to the extra peaks was obtained with a tetragonal cell with @xmath30   and @xmath31  .",

    "this does , however , not affect the scattering experiments or magnetic structure solution presented in the following .",
    "+   +    at the bottom of figure [ fig : npd_structure ] , we show the npd data of the same polycrystalline sample at 1.5 k collected with a wavelength of @xmath26  .",
    "we observe a single magnetic diffraction peak at @xmath32 = 7.2@xmath33 that corresponds to the ( 001 ) reflection of the tetragonal crystal structure on hand .",
    "it can be indexed with the propagation vector @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "this implies an afm order for the body centered bravais lattice .",
    "a symmetry treatment was used for the modelling of the magnetic structure , thereby the magnetically ordered structures are described in terms of their magnetic propagation vector and the irreducible representations ( see , references @xcite ) .",
    "the decomposition of the magnetic representation for the @xmath27 space group in kovalev s notation ( @xmath35 are the allowed irreducible representations of the symmetry groups @xmath36 ) , with the propagation vector @xmath37 $ ] for cobalt in the crystallographic 4d ( 0,1/2,1/4 ) position gives the following allowed symmetry solutions : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the one - dimensional irreducible representations @xmath38 and @xmath39 give solutions for the magnetic structure , where the magnetic moments are aligned along the crystallographic @xmath42-axis .",
    "however , the magnetic ( 001 ) reflection is observed and therefore both these magnetic structures can be rejected .",
    "the two - dimensional irreducible representations @xmath40 and @xmath41 give magnetic structure configurations with the magnetic moments aligned along directions in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "of these two , the chessboard solution @xmath40 can be rejected , because the structure factor @xmath44 for the bragg reflection ( 001 ) must for @xmath40 be zero due to symmetry .",
    "thus , we have a unique solution @xmath41 ; here the magnetic moments form fm sheets with the spin direction in the _ ab _ plane with a magnetic coupling of 0.20(1)@xmath2/co . the magnetic structure refinement together with the structural refinement is shown in figure [ fig : npd_structure ] and in the inset therein .",
    "the corresponding real - space magnetic structure is depicted in figure [ fig : magnetic_structure ] .",
    "it should be noted that the direction of the magnetic moments in the layer can not be deduced from our experimental data .",
    "this solution can also be represented in the shubnikov magnetic group @xmath45 ( no .",
    "11.57 ) with the cobalt atoms in the 4h position @xmath46,@xmath47,@xmath47;@xmath48,0,@xmath49 . in this case , the basis transformation from the parent tetragonal paramagnetic group to the monoclinic shubnikov group is ( 1,1,0),(0,0,-1),(-1,0,0 ) with the origin shift @xmath50,@xmath51,@xmath52 .",
    "this magnetic structure it commonly referred to as a - type antiferromagnetism .",
    "+   +    in figure [ fig : m(t , h ) ] , we show the magnetic susceptibility as @xmath19 ( a ) and the magnetization ( b ) in a temperature range between @xmath13 = 5 k to 100 k with the external field @xmath53 perpendicular to the _ c _ axis of .",
    "these measurements were performed in magnetic fields ranging from @xmath54 1 t to 7 t in 0.5 t steps . the clearly pronounced metamagnetic transition from a afm orientation to a fm orientation of the magnetic moments",
    "can be observed in these measurements .",
    "the transition temperature is shifted only slightly to lower temperatures with higher magnetic fields .",
    "a clear saturation of the magnetic moments in a fm or canted afm alignment is found in fields greater than @xmath55 , while the transition is observed to be continuous . in figure",
    "[ fig : magn_csco2se2]a , the field - dependent magnetization of at 5 , 15 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 45 , 55 and 60 k is shown . as expected",
    ", the field dependence of the magnetization of deviates from a common afm behaviour and further supports the scenario of a spin reorientation and therefore of a metamagnetic transition .",
    "three distinct regimes can be determined in the field dependent magnetization .",
    "the fields necessary for the initialization of the metamagnetic transition is small compared to other metamagnetic materials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+   +    four different magnetic phases can therefore be identified in : a paramagnetic high - temperature phase ( pm ) , an antiferromagnetically ordered phase ( afm ) , one or more metamagnetic phase transitions ( mm ) , and a ferromagnetically ordered phase ( fm ) .",
    "this nomenclature is thereby chosen on the basis of earlier reports of similar magnetic properties ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite ) .",
    "here , we have used the deviations from linearity , as observed in the second derivative ( @xmath56 ) , in the field - dependent magnetization as a measure for the respective critical fields ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig : magn_csco2se2]a for the measurement at @xmath23 15 k. by applying these criteria to the various measured temperatures , we are able to draw a summarizing magnetic phase diagram for as shown in figure [ fig : magn_csco2se2]c .",
    "it should be noted that all of the observed transitions are continuous and that all here determined critical fields are not strict quantities .",
    "furthermore , at higher temperatures the transitions broaden and are less pronounced in the field - dependent magnetization @xmath59 ( represented by the open circles ) .",
    "the observed phase diagram is in qualitative agreement with other metamagnetic materials .",
    "thereby , layered a - type antiferromagnetic materials often undergo metamagnetic transitions in external magnetic fields parallel to the antiferromagnetically ordered spin lattices , because the interlayer afm coupling is in such an alignment comparably weak .",
    "the transitions observed here are in general agreement with earlier observations by yang j et al .",
    "@xcite , however in this earlier study a lower @xmath58 was observed .",
    "this discrepancy might most likely be connected to a variable off - stoichiometric composition of the compound as it has been extensively studied for the closely - related and phases ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+   +    in figure [ fig : mf ] , we show the npd data of in magnetic fields @xmath60 0 t , 2 t , 4 t , 4.5 t , 5 t , 5.5 t , and 6 t at @xmath23 1.5 k , measured with a wavelength of @xmath61 1.886  .",
    "the data is normalized to the intensity of the structural bragg reflection ( 002 ) .",
    "for better clarity only the data in the vicinity of the magnetic ( 001 ) reflection is shown .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic ( 001 ) reflection is slightly decreased in magnetic fields of @xmath60 2 t and 4 t. according to the phase diagram ( see figure [ fig : magn_csco2se2 ] ) in these fields a small magnetic moment in the direction of the external field can be expected due to possible canting where the ferromagnetic moment increases . therefore , the symmetry of the magnetic order is only slightly perturbed , leading to a corresponding small alternation of the magnetic ( 001 ) reflection . in larger magnetic fields , such as @xmath60 4.5 t , 5 t , and 5.5 t , the magnetic ( 001 ) reflection",
    "is strongly reduced in intensity and in a field of @xmath60 6 t not observable anymore .",
    "these findings are in good agreement with the magnetic phase diagram derived from the field - dependent magnetization measurements .",
    "a likely scenario for the transition is shown in the inset of figure [ fig : mf ] , where the a - type afm structure undergoes a field - induced transition to a fm structure with the magnetic moments laying in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "+   + it should be noted that in the series of the with ( a = cs , rb , and k and x = se , s ) compounds , the _ a_-axis is of similar size for all series members , whereas the _ c_-axis increases strongly from to .",
    "thereby , the interlayer distance of the -layers increases and causes the difference in the magnetic behaviour this suggests that a variation of the magnetic properties by chemical variation of the interlayer distance might be of great interest for these and related materials .",
    "this is especially expected since the fragile antiferromagnetic order in can be perturbed in a facile manner by a weak external magnetic field .",
    "in summary , we report on the magnetic properties of , which we have investigated by a series of npd and by squid magnetometry measurements .",
    "we find that is an antiferromagnet with a nel temperature of @xmath0 66 k with an effective magnetic moment of @xmath24 1.81 @xmath2/co .",
    "however , its nearest neighbour interactions between the magnetic moments are ferromagnetic . in the collected npd data ,",
    "we observe a single magnetic diffraction peak at @xmath32 = 7.2@xmath33 below @xmath62 , which corresponds to the magnetic propagation vector @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we have found a unique solution of the magnetic structure of , where the magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "these fm sheets order antiferromagnetically along the _ c_-axis . in external magnetic fields up to @xmath63",
    "7 t undergoes a metamagnetic transition .",
    "a spin rearrangement occurs already for a comparably small critical field of @xmath3(5k ) @xmath4 0.3 t with the moments fully ferromagnetically saturated in a magnetic field of @xmath5(5k ) @xmath4 6.4 t. our study characterizes , which is chemically and electronically posed closely to the superconductors , as a host of versatile magnetic interactions that likely can be tuned by chemical variation of the interlayer distance . in further studies ,",
