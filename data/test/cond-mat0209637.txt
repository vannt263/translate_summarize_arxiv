    "experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in a dilute gas of alkali atoms @xcite stimulated a number of theoretical studies of the quantum degenerate , weakly interacting many body system . while the lowest energy state of the celebrated gross - pitaevski equation @xcite describes remarkably well the properties of the condensate at zero temperature , the dynamics of the bose gas at non - zero temperatures remains a challenge .",
    "the most successful description of the temperature dependence of the condensate oscillation frequencies and their damping rates has been obtained using different versions of the two gas models @xcite . while useful , these models assume from the very beginning that the system at finite temperatures consists of two distinct factions : the condensate and the thermal cloud",
    ". a more fundamental approach would deduce the very existence of the condensed part directly from the dynamics of the many body system . in a series of papers ,",
    "several groups @xcite proposed a classical field approximation to fulfill this goal . in this approximation ,",
    "the bosonic field operator is replaced by a classical field .",
    "this dramatic simplification is rooted in quantum electrodynamics , where classical electric and magnetic fields arise naturally if the number of quanta is large in a given mode .",
    "the classical field approximation is a simple and convenient technique describing the condensate in dynamical equilibrium with the thermal cloud , at temperatures close to the critical one .",
    "we have shown that the whole isolated system may be viewed as a single classical field undergoing nonlinear dynamics leading to a steady state @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the condensate is defined as the dominant term in the spectral decomposition of the time - averaged single - particle density matrix .",
    "two cases were discussed : the box with periodic boundary conditions @xcite and the realistic case of a spherically symmetric harmonic trap @xcite . in our procedure it is the observation process and the finite detection time that allow for splitting the system into the condensate and the thermal cloud .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to further corroborate the details and the applicability of the classical fields approximation .    in section [ method ]",
    "we briefly review the approximation based on the classical fields .",
    "we stress again the need for the time averaging of the single particle density matrix for unambiguous splitting of the system into the condensed and uncondensed phases .",
    "the classical field approximation is introduced with the high momentum cut - off . in section [ box ]",
    "we study in some detail the role of this cut - off in the model of a cubic box with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also analyze the dependence of the cross - over energy on the value of the coupling constant . within our approximation , it is a growing function of the scattering length . in section [ vortices ] , for the first time , we apply the method to a dynamical dissipative process .",
    "we phase imprint the vortex on a finite temperature , partially condensed bose gas and track its decay .",
    "we conclude with the summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "we start with a brief description of our approach ( some other details can be found also in@xcite ) .",
    "first , we consider the simplest case of a system of @xmath0 bosonic atoms of mass @xmath1 interacting via two - body forces .",
    "the @xmath0-body hamiltonian written in the second quantization formalism has a form : @xmath2 where the first term is the kinetic energy and the second one is the energy of two - body interactions . in writing the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) we made a standard assumption : in the low energy limit a two - body interaction potential is approximated by a zero - range one .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath3 is determined by a single parameter ",
    "the s - wave scattering length @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the field operator satisfying equal - time bosonic commutation relations :    @xmath7=\\delta({\\bf   r}-{\\bf r}^{\\prime}).\\ ] ]    the field operator can be expanded into any complete set of single - particle wave functions .",
    "one of these basis sets is of particular importance  the one which corresponds to eigenfunctions of a single - particle density matrix@xcite .",
    "this is because these functions have direct physical interpretation as they define coherent modes of the system .",
    "these modes are related to , typically performed , single - particle measurements .",
    "note that a theoretical description of correlated measurements , which involve a simultaneous detection of a few particles , should be based on an appropriate multi - particle reduced density matrix .",
    "the single - particle mode of macroscopic occupation is a bose condensate . in the ideal gas case eigenfunctions of the single - particle density matrix",
    "are obviously one particle states of the external potential .",
    "the situation becomes more complex if particles interact .",
    "in general , the eigenmodes are unknown .",
    "the only exception is a stationary system of particles trapped in a box with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "the symmetry of the problem imposes very strong constrains and eigenfunctions of the single - particle density matrix are simply plane waves  even in the presence of interactions .",
    "the field operator is therefore : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a bosonic operator which annihilates a particle of momentum @xmath10 .",
    "a full operator solution of the heisenberg equation originating from the above hamiltonian is not available and some approximations are necessary .",
    "following bogoliubov , at zero temperature , when all particles occupy a single zero - momentum mode , the corresponding annihilation operator can be substituted by a c - number amplitude , @xmath11 .",
    "this is possible because the commutator @xmath12 = 1 \\ll   n$ ] is much smaller than the number of particles occupying the zero - momentum state .",
    "the remaining terms of the expansion ( [ modeexpand ] ) represent quantum corrections which in the lowest order of approximation are neglected .",
    "let us note that the procedure leads to a substitution of the the full field operator by a c - number wave function :    @xmath13    the condensate wave function satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation which is successfully used for description of low temperature behavior of the bose - einstein condensate : @xmath14 this equation preserves both the energy and the particle number , i.e. the normalization of the wave function @xmath15 .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation can also describe trapped condensates when a term describing the external potential is included .",
    "our approach is a simple generalization of the above procedure .",
    "let us notice first that at relatively high energies ( but below the critical one ) there exists a number of modes , say @xmath16 , whose occupation significantly exceeds unity , i.e. many different momentum states , up to a certain @xmath17 are highly populated .",
    "consequently , all corresponding annihilation operators in the expansion ( [ modeexpand ] ) can be substituted by complex amplitudes and the remaining terms may be neglected :    @xmath18    this approach evidently leads to the same gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gp ] ) for a wave function describing the `` macroscopic part '' of the whole system , or , more precisely , to its finite lattice version .",
    "this kind of approach is frequently used in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the only difference from the zero temperature case is that now this wave function does not correspond to the minimal energy solution .",
    "instead , it is a relatively high energy state .",
    "as it has been shown in@xcite , regardless of the particular choice of an initial state @xmath19 , different than the gross - pitaevskii eigenstate , the system evolves towards the same stationary state uniquely determined by the energy and the particle number .",
    "more precisely , occupations of all macroscopically populated eigenmodes @xmath20 fluctuate around their mean values@xcite .",
    "the self consistency of the c - number approximation requires that all populations have to be large , @xmath21 . to this end ,",
    "the number of classical modes @xmath16 has to be carefully chosen for each energy and particle number@xcite",
    ". this fact can be checked only _ a posteriori _ when the stationary populations are obtained .",
    "the intimate link between the energy , the number of particles and the number of modes is the essential ingredient of the whole method .",
    "there is still one point which requires additional discussion .",
    "in fact , the `` quasi - stationary '' high energy solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation represents a pure state of the system with _ all particles _ in the same single state @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , it seems to be totally unjustified to interpret @xmath23 as relative occupations of different coherent modes of the system .",
    "the last concept is associated with a mixed state .",
    "detailed inspection shows , however , that the relative phases of complex amplitudes @xmath9 vary in time rapidly . on the other hand an observation process lasts for a finite period of time , typically of the order of hundreds of microseconds .",
    "it is sufficiently long for a `` decoherence '' of different eigenmodes :    @xmath24    in the stationary regime the time averaged quantities do not depend on time . on the contrary ,",
    "a temporal wave function of the whole system varies very rapidly .",
    "therefore , what is being observed is related to a time averaged single - particle density matrix @xmath25 .",
    "it is the observation that reduces a pure state to a mixed one . for particles trapped in a periodic box we have :    @xmath26    eq.([time_box ] ) shows that eigenvalues of the time averaged single - particle matrix are normalized occupations of different coherent modes of the system .",
    "we want to stress that the averaging procedure is essential for the correct physical interpretation of the high energy solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "note that instead of averaging over time , spatial avergaing can be performed .",
    "their importance can be fully appreciated in a more realistic case of harmonically trapped bose condensates when eigenmodes of a single - particle matrix are not known .",
    "it is just diagonalization of the time averaged density matrix which gives simultaneously the eigenmodes and the populations .",
    "results of our calculations for a harmonically trapped bose condensate at finite energy are presented in@xcite .",
    "the time averaged density has a characteristic bimodal pattern : sharp peak of condensed atoms embedded in a broad thermal cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "an instantaneous distribution consists of a number of irregular spiky structures@xcite . according to our numerical calculations ,",
    "the average width of a single spike is about three times larger than the healing length , the distance over which the condensate wave function heals back when perturbed locally .",
    "the characteristic length scale of the irregular structure is slightly larger ( but of the same order ) than the grid spacing necessary for description of the system of a given energy and particle number .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the self - consistency of the approximation requires a very precise selection of a number of modes @xmath16 what in the present case directly translates into the grid spacing . in our approach @xmath16",
    "becomes an important , physical parameter .",
    "in this section we explore our approach and present some important technical details .",
    "we consider here the system trapped in a periodic box because in this situation the coherent eigenmodes are uniquely determined by the symmetry of the potential .",
    "this greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "we numerically solve the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gp ] ) on a finite grid using the fast fourier transform split - operator method .",
    "the number of grid points is equal to the number of different momentum states . in order to explore the link between the number of macroscopically occupied modes , the number of particles and the energy we solve eq.([gp ] ) in a 3d geometry varying the number of eigenmodes @xmath16 only . in the calculations we keep the same initial state @xmath19 which guarantees that the energy per particle is constant .",
    "similarly , the value of the following product is fixed :    @xmath27    the results might seem surprising : the larger the number of modes @xmath16 ( with other parameters constant ) the higher the occupation of the condensate mode @xmath28 .",
    "this result requires a more detailed discussion .",
    "the total energy , the number of modes @xmath16 and the product of @xmath29 are the _ only _ control parameters in our method .",
    "the number of particles @xmath0 as well as the coupling strength @xmath3 do not enter the dynamical equation ( [ gp ] ) separately  it depends only on the product @xmath29 . nevertheless , the condition of validity of the classical field approximation allows to determine the above parameters quite accurately .",
    "an occupation of the highest eigenmode @xmath30 must be larger then one .",
    "we arbitrarily set this value to 5 .",
    "this way , having a stationary value of a relative occupation @xmath31 , we can determine both @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "it occurs that the requirement of self - consistency indicates that in our calculations the number of particles grows with @xmath16 while the interaction strength @xmath3 decreases in order to satisfy the condition ( [ limit ] ) . only by examining the link between all parameters of the classical field approximation",
    "can we fully interprete our data .",
    "fraction of particles in the condensate @xmath32 as a function of particle number for _ gn = const_. for comparison we show the curve given by the equation @xmath33 . ]    in fig.[mean_vs_np ] a relative abundance of the condensate atoms is plotted as a function of the number of particles .",
    "the condensate occupation can be quite accurately approximated by the following analytic expression :    @xmath34    this behavior is in agreement with a recent finding@xcite .",
    "lieb and seiringer studied the properties of a true ground state @xmath0-body wavefunction of a system of @xmath0 bose particles interacting via two - body forces .",
    "they have shown that in the limit of @xmath35 with @xmath36 the relative population of the dominant eigenmode of the corresponding single particle density matrix aproaches @xmath37 while the eigenmode tends towards a ground state solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "our method shows how this limit is approached .    in the next series of calculations we estimate the interaction - induced shift of the cross - over energy for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we prefer to use the term `` cross - over energy '' instead of `` critical energy '' as , strictly speaking , the critical energy is defined in the thermodynamic limit only . for a finite system ( like the one we deal with here ) several measures of",
    "the corresponding `` cross - over '' energy can be defined as there is no sharp phase transition .",
    "one of them @xcite is based on the rapid change of the probability distribution of the condensate occupation .",
    "we study the occupation of the condensate mode @xmath38 .",
    "the total energy of the system is changed while @xmath0 and @xmath3 are kept constant .",
    "this requires an optimization of the number of classical fields @xmath16 to be taken into account : again , we set the occupation of the least occupied mode to 5 ( @xmath39 ) . the above constraint",
    "does not allow for a continuous change of the energy though .",
    "when a quasi - stationary state of a given energy is reached we trace a temporal population of the condensate mode @xmath40 for a long time ( about @xmath41 time steps ) .",
    "this way we obtain a probability distribution of the condensate population which is presented in fig.[histogram ] . in this figure",
    "we show two characteristic distributions for different energies of the system .",
    "one of them ( for the energy per particle @xmath42 ) is centered around some non - zero mean value of @xmath43 ( the grey histogram ) , while the other ( for the energy @xmath44 ) is peaked at @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the energy of the first excited state .",
    "statistics of the condensate occupation in time .",
    "the grey histogram presents the case slightly below the cross - over energy ( energy per particle @xmath47 ) , while the transparent histogram corresponds to the situation above the cross - over energy ( energy per particle @xmath48 ) .",
    "note that the highest bar of the latter histogram is off the scale of the figure ( its value is 0.87 ) . here @xmath49 and @xmath50 . ]    despite the fact that the values of energy for which both histograms are plotted are very similar , the rapid change of the character of the statistics evidently signifies the onset of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the two energies give the lower and upper limit on the critical energy for a given interaction strength .",
    "we can not determine the critical energy with better accuracy because of the previously discussed link between the parameters of our method .",
    "in the fig.[ekrit_vs_g ] we show the upper and lower limits for the critical energy as a function of the coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "the critical energy grows with @xmath3 .",
    "the same must happen to the critical temperature .",
    "we do not estimate the critical temperature as the method based on fitting the thermal distribution to the outer wings of the time averaged density profiles introduces a large uncertaintity@xcite .",
    "there is still a controversy in the literature@xcite about the magnitude and the sign of the shift of critical temperature due to interactions .",
    "the accuracy of our calculations , at the present stage , does not allow for a precise determination of this quantity .",
    "nevertheless , they certainly indicate that the critical energy ( and temperature ) in the case of gas trapped in a box grows with interactions .",

    "this result can be compared with theoretical predictions for pure , zero temperature , condensates  however , in this case there is no dissipation and off center singly quantized vortices in our case would follow _ closed _ circular trajectories . for pure condensates the angular velocity of the vortex line diverges at the condensate boundary @xcite .",
    "we also see this kind of behavior in our data for a partly condensed bose gas . to be specific , we have compared our data with a variational estimate provided by eq.(87 ) in @xcite ( here @xmath61 , as the trap is nonrotating ) taking 48000 @xmath51rb atoms . despite notable differences between the two situations ( presence or absence of dissipation due to the thermal cloud ) the agreement is rather good even at the quantitative level .",

    "<S> , the relative population of the condensate tends to unity . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the cross - over energy , at which the probability distribution of the condensate occupation changes its character , grows with a growing scattering length . in the more physical case of the condensate in the harmonic trap we investigate the dissipative dynamics of a vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the decay time and the velocities of the vortex with the available analytic estimates . </S>"
