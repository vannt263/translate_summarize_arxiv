    "many astrophysical observations provide evidences for the existence of non - baryonic dark matter from the galactic scale to the cosmological scale  @xcite .",
    "its existence in our universe has been revealed only by its gravitational effects , while its mass and interactions to the standard model ( sm ) particles are still unclear . among many scenarios that had been proposed to account for non - baryonic dark matter , the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) scenario , where the particle with weak scale mass and interactions could be thermally frozen out and its abundance would be the observed dark matter relic density  @xcite , is one of the most attractive scenarios because it may be produced and detected at the current or future colliders .",
    "actually many works in the literature have dealt with this issue  @xcite , but they have mainly focused on the large hadron colliders ( lhc ) .    the dark matter search at colliders is based on the production of sm particle(s ) with missing energies .",
    "the typical signals are mono - jet  @xcite , mono - photon  @xcite , mono-@xmath3  @xcite or mono-@xmath4  @xcite with missing energies . in principle",
    ", the particles which are produced together with the dark matter particle(s ) could be any sm fundamental particles or their composite states .",
    "for example , the dark matter production associated with a heavy - quark - and - heavy - anti - quark ( @xmath5 ) pair may also play an important role in searching for dark matter .",
    "it is known that the dark matter pair production associated with the @xmath5 pair could be more effective in the case that the dark matter interaction with the sm particles depends on the mass of the relevant sm quark  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to use the process of dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium to search for dark matter at colliders .",
    "a heavy quarkonium is a meson which is a bound state of a @xmath5 pair . naively speaking",
    ", the heavy - quark - pair - associated production of dark matter would be more effective for the dark matter detection than the light - quark - pair - associated production if the effective coupling of dark matter to the quark pair is proportional to the quark mass . in a similar way ,",
    "the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium would play a more essential role in the probe of such operators than dark matter production associated with a light meson .",
    "the dark matter production associated with the sm particle(s ) can be investigated in any collider experiments . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium at @xmath0 factories , whose center - of - mass ( cm ) energy is @xmath6 gev . however , we note that this search will easily be applied to the international linear collider ( ilc ) and large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite",
    ".    there is no evidence for dark matter from the collider experiments so far .",
    "however , there are some reports for dark matter candidate signals from direct detection of dark matter , which is carried out in underground experiments , and also from indirect detection of dark matter from astrophysical observations , in particular , in the dark matter mass region of @xmath7 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark matter mass region below a few gev has not been well investigated , especially , in the direct detection experiments of dark matter because the very light dark matter can not hit a nucleon with significant recoil .",
    "one of the strongest bounds on the dark matter signals in the indirect detection of dark matter comes from the @xmath8-ray observation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the fermi - lat satellite  @xcite .",
    "however , the constraints become weakened below the dark matter mass region less than about 4 gev because of the uncertainty of hadronization of final state particles in the dark matter annihilation and the limit of the photon energy threshold of the detector in the fermi gamma - ray space telescope  @xcite .    since such light dark matter mass region",
    "could be investigated at colliders  @xcite , the collider detection of dark matter would be complementary to the direct detection of dark matter and the indirect detection of dark matter .    at @xmath0 factories ,",
    "dark matter can not only be produced directly , but also produced from the decays of a heavy quarkonium .",
    "for example , the invisible decay of @xmath9 can give constraints on the properties of light dark matter through the decay of @xmath10 followed by @xmath11 nothing at @xmath0 factories  @xcite .",
    "also , the charm factories can contribute to search for dark matter by investigating the invisible decay of a charmonium , @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath9 and @xmath1 decays at @xmath0 and charm factories are more suitable to probe light dark matter interactions than the mono - jet search at high energy hadron colliders when the mass of mediator is not large  @xcite . the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium at @xmath0 factories would also be complementary to the invisible decay of a heavy quarkonium as well as the mono - jet searches at high energy colliders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we describe the relevant effective operators for the dark matter interactions with the sm quarks . as a candidate for dark matter , we take into account two cases : dirac fermionic dark matter and real scalar dark matter .",
    "we adopt the effective field theory ( eft ) approach for the interaction of dark matter with the sm quarks . in sec .",
    "[ calc ] , we calculate the cross sections for the dark matter production at @xmath0 factories as well as for the sm backgrounds .",
    "we also interpret the constraints on the properties of the dark matter interaction to the upper limit on the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "for a model - independent search for dark matter , we assume that @xmath12 , which stands for either a dirac fermion or real scalar , is the only component of dark matter and singlet under the sm gauge group .",
    "the extension to the majorana fermion or complex scalar dark matter would be straightforward and not so much different from the dirac fermion or real scalar studied here .",
    "we adopt the effective field theory approach , where the mediator connecting the dark sector to the sm particles is heavy enough to be integrated out  @xcite .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the dark matter interactions to the sm fields can be described by higher - dimensional operators .",
    "since we are interested in the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium , the relevant effective operators must contain the heavy quark fields .",
    "the dimension-6 operators in the dirac fermion case which we will consider in this paper are  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the heavy - quark mass and @xmath15 represents the energy scale of new physics .",
    "effectively @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass of the mediator and @xmath18 are the coupling of the mediator to the dark sector and sm sector , respectively .",
    "for the ( pseudo)scalar interaction operators @xmath19 , an additional helicity suppression factor is taken into account .    in the real scalar case ,",
    "the relevant dimension-6 operators are given by  @xcite @xmath20 there are more dimension-6 operators which would be necessary for complete study of the dark matter production .",
    "for example , one can consider the operators which include the gluonic field strengths ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "they may contribute to the production of dark matter particles associated with a heavy quarkonium at the one - loop level so that the dark matter production process would be suppressed .",
    "for the probe of the operators which include the electromagnetic field strengths ( @xmath22 ) or a lepton pair , the dark matter production associated with a photon would be more efficient at the lepton colliders like @xmath0 factories or ilc .",
    "it is well known that the eft approach is valid when the particle mediating the interaction is heavier than the typical energy scale of the process , which is the maximum momentum transfer in the process . at high - energy hadron collider where the energy scale of the fundamental process is not fixed , the eft approach may break down unless the mediator is not too heavy compared to the cm energy of the collider .",
    "then , the eft approach may over- or under - estimate the result in a uv - complete theory  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath0 factories are relatively free from this issue because the cm energy is fixed as well as not so high .    some operators in eqs .",
    "( [ effopfermion ] ) and ( [ effopscalar ] ) do not respect the sm gauge group symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scalar operators @xmath23 require a @xmath24- or @xmath25 channel scalar exchange for uv completion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that in the @xmath24-channel scalar - exchange model , the eft approach prediction is completely different from that of the uv complete model",
    ". therefore , one should be more cautious about the interpretation of the bounds on such operators obtained in the eft approach .",
    "the production of a heavy quarkonium is described by non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , which is an effective field theory of qcd  @xcite . as usual , the factorization between short - distance and long - distance physics is assumed .",
    "while the factorization between high - energy and low - energy physics for the inclusive heavy - quarkonium production has not been proved , the factorization for its exclusive production at @xmath0 factories was given in  @xcite .",
    "the schematic expression for the production cross section is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the long - distance matrix element ( ldme ) , which is the probability of the evolution of a heavy - quark pair into a heavy quarkonium @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the corresponding short - distance coefficient , which is responsible for the production of a heavy - quark and anti - quark pair .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is obtained by integrating the squared amplitude over the phase space after averaging the spin states of initial particles and summing the spin states of final particles .",
    "the amplitude for the production of @xmath28 can be obtained by projecting the production amplitude of a @xmath5 pair onto @xmath28 via the spin and color projection operators of @xmath28 ( generically denoted by @xmath30 here ) : @xmath31,\\ ] ] with @xmath32 being a matrix that acts on spinors of the @xmath5 pair in the amplitude of the @xmath5 pair production  @xcite .    in nrqcd",
    ", a heavy - quark and anti - quark pair can be produced in a color - singlet state or color - octet state .",
    "the color - octet state can evolve into a color - singlet state by emitting or absorbing soft gluons .",
    "typically , the color - octet ldme is suppressed by @xmath33 or higher in the heavy - quark velocity @xmath34 compared to the color - singlet ldme . therefore ,",
    "unless there exists a kinematical enhancement factor in the short - distance coefficient for the color - octet amplitude , the color - singlet amplitude dominates . in the @xmath0 factories , the initial colliding beams are the electron and positron , which are neutral under @xmath35 gauge symmetry",
    "therefore , the production of the heavy quarkonium in the color - singlet state can occur only when the other particles are color - neutral or in the color - singlet state .",
    "however , the production of a heavy quarkonium in a color - octet state must accompany with at least a color - octet particle , for instance , an additional gluon or a pair of quark and anti - quark in the color - octet state . in the dark matter production or off - shell @xmath4 boson production at @xmath0 factories ,",
    "the color - singlet heavy quarkonium production is dominant .",
    "the color - octet heavy quarkonium production has a wavefunction suppression factor of @xmath36 or higher .",
    "furthermore , the color - octet process has an additional suppression factor due to the additional color - octet gluon or a pair of quark and anti - quark .",
    "therefore , for the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium at @xmath0 factories , it is sufficient to take into account only the color - singlet contribution .",
    "the color - singlet ldme is determined by the electromagnetic decay of the heavy quarkonium .",
    "explicitly , for charm quark mass @xmath37 gev and to leading - order in @xmath34 , we take the color - singlet ldmes to be  @xcite @xmath38    first we calculate the sm backgrounds . in the sm ,",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to the heavy quarkonium production with missing energy have at least one weak - boson exchange , which is connected to a pair of neutrinos .",
    "there are also diagrams with two weak - boson exchanges , but they are suppressed by @xmath39 so that we ignore those diagrams .",
    "then , we left with seven diagrams in the sm , whose representative diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramsm ] .",
    "the irreducible background for the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium is the @xmath40 process followed by @xmath41 , as depicted in the first two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagramsm ] .",
    "there is also a @xmath3 fusion diagram , which is required by gauge invariance , as shown in the last diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagramsm ] .",
    "other diagrams not shown are obtained by reversing the flow of fermions .    in the monojet production at hadron colliders , except the irreducible sm background @xmath42 followed by @xmath43 , there is another type of the sm background , for example , the process @xmath44 , where both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are missed .",
    "we note that this kind of background can be ignored at @xmath0 factories because the relevant process is @xmath47 , which is highly suppressed .",
    "we note that , at the @xmath48 machines , there may be continuum background coming from @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate this continuum background by choosing the invariant mass @xmath50 of the @xmath51 pair in the region @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass and decay width of @xmath28 respectively for @xmath55 or @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the cross section for the continuum background is less than @xmath56 ab , which can be neglected at @xmath0 factories .",
    "there may also be a continuum background coming from process like @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) since @xmath1 may be detected experimentally via the decay @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless the cross section from this continuum contribution is also negligible .",
    "we take the electromagnetic coupling to be @xmath60 at the scale @xmath61 and the charm quark mass to be @xmath37 gev .",
    "then , the cross sections for a heavy quarkonium production associated with a pair of neutrinos in the sm are calculated as ( 1 ab = 1 attobarn = @xmath62 @xmath63 ) @xmath64 the cross section for @xmath65 production is much smaller than that for the @xmath66 production .",
    "this is mainly because of the dominated contributions from photon - fragmentation diagrams , where a virtual photon evolves into a @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "all the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagramsm ] contribute to the @xmath67 production while only the first diagram contributes to the @xmath68 production .",
    "however , the first diagram does not correspond to the photon - fragmentation contribution and is suppressed by @xmath69 as compared to other photon - fragmentation diagrams .",
    "the expected event number for the @xmath66 production is about @xmath70 @xmath71 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath70 @xmath72 ab@xmath73 without any cut .",
    "since the expected event number for the @xmath65 production is entirely negligible , even one event of the @xmath2 plus missing energy measured at @xmath0 factories would imply the existence of new physics .      in this section ,",
    "we calculate the cross section for the dirac fermion dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium .",
    "there are two feynman diagrams , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the other diagram is obtained by reversing the flow of the charm quark .",
    "the bulb in the figure represents vertices of various effective operators .",
    "the relevant operators to the heavy quarkonium production depend on the quantum number of the heavy quarkonium , where @xmath74 for @xmath1 and @xmath75 for @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the operators @xmath76 contribute only to the @xmath77 process , while the operators @xmath78 only to the @xmath79 .",
    "we note that only the @xmath78 operators can contribute to the invisible decays of the heavy quarkonium states @xmath9 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium could provide constraints on a larger set of operators , which can not be probed in the invisible decays of @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ figurexsec ] shows the cross sections ( a ) for @xmath80 and ( b ) for @xmath81 as a function of the dark matter mass @xmath82 for @xmath83 gev ( dashed line ) , @xmath84 gev ( solid line ) , and @xmath85 gev ( dotted line ) , respectively .",

    "[ figurelam ] .",
    "we note that for the region below some value of @xmath15 , our limits become untrustworthy .",
    "recall that @xmath118 .",
    "a very tiny @xmath15 can be achieved only when @xmath119 becomes large since the mediator mass @xmath17 should be larger than @xmath120 for validity of eft approach . on the other hand",

    "the eft description breaks down in the region @xmath123 .",

    "so the best thing one can hope for is to detect inclusive signals rather than exclusive ones .",

    "for example , the @xmath170 symmetry may require the sm higgs boson exchange between the dark sector and sm sector for the scalar@xmath171scalar interaction , which can not be integrated out at the energy of the lhc .",
    "searches for dark matter at the @xmath0 factories are relatively free from such complications",
    ".    the search for light dark matter via its production associated with a heavy quarkonium at @xmath0 factories would provide both the alternative and complementary ways to the hadron colliders and the heavy quarkonium invisible decays .",
