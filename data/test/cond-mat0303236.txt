    "in the emerging field of single - molecule electronics there is a large interest in transport through mesoscopic systems with strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "there has been a number of experiments in which transport through a single molecule has been reported .",
    "@xcite one example is the series of experiments by park _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the current through a single @xmath4 molecule was strongly coupled to a single vibrational mode .",
    "the single phonon mode was associated with the motion of the molecule in the confining potential created by the van - der - waals interaction with the electrodes .",
    "later , similar devices with more complicated molecules were investigated ,  @xcite and they also showed excitation spectra which may be associated with emission of vibrational quanta .    theoretically , there has been a large amount of work on the problem of tunneling through a single level with coupling to phonon modes . in many experimental realizations",
    "the tunnel coupling to the leads is rather weak , and the transport is dominated by the well - known coulomb blockade effect . in this regime , where the transport is sequential , the use of a rate equation approach is appropriate rather than a coherent scattering approach . motivated by the above mentioned single - molecule experiments , the rate equation approach has been used in a number of recent papers .  @xcite some of these studies dealt with the issue of non - equilibrium phonon states , and the possibility of having negative differential conductance in such molecular systems .",
    "@xcite physically , it is an essential question how the excited vibrational levels are allowed to relax , either through coupling to the environment , for example the phonons or plasmons of the metal substrate , or by virtue of the tunneling electrons .",
    "@xcite in the case where the relaxation of the vibrational mode is faster than the tunneling rate one can assume an equilibrium phonon distribution .",
    "the coupling between the vibrational mode and the environment depends strongly on which vibrational mode is considered . for intra - molecular vibrations",
    "the lifetime can be very long .",
    "@xcite however , for the experiments of ref .",
    ", it was suggested that the vibrational motion was associated with a center of mass motion , which is coupled to the environment more strongly as we discuss in this paper . a sketch of the physical setup that we consider is shown in fig .  [ fig : system ] .    ( 6,4.5)(0,0 ) ( -.5,0 ) and @xmath5 .",
    "when an electron hops onto the molecule , the force created by image charges or local electric fields causes a shift of the equilibrium position of the oscillator and consequently emissions of quanta .",
    "the weights of the different final states are given by the well - known frank - condon overlap factors .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to consider the influence of damping of the molecular motion by emission of phonons into the substrates . , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in this paper , we assume that the tunneling rate is much smaller than the rate of relaxation to other degrees of freedom . hence , the usual rate equation approach is applicable , and we can assume that the phonons relax between each tunneling event according to a thermal boson distribution .",
    "we study a model of one single molecular orbital with strong coulomb repulsion coupled to a dissipative environment .",
    "the dissipation is caused by coupling to phonon modes of the electrodes as well as electromagnetic modes and it is represented by a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the description is thus similar to the well - known theory of coulomb blockade in an electromagnetic environment .",
    "@xcite however , there is a difference in how the coupling to the environment appears . in the electromagnetic environment case , the tunneling of an electron results in a sudden displacement of the position of the charge , while here the tunneling results in a sudden appearance of a force on the oscillator .",
    "for this reason , we go through the derivations in some detail and derive a general formula for the @xmath2-@xmath3 curves .",
    "this general result does not depend on the nature of the environment but we then specialize to two cases .",
    "we consider a molecule attached to a substrate , using a continuum model for the substrate , and compare our result to a reference model featuring frequency - independent damping and quality factor .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 curves , as a function of the elastic parameters of the substrate and the size of the molecule , feature quite different line shapes as compared to the assumption of constant friction .    to get a simple estimate of the importance of the coupling to the substrate ,",
    "consider a model where the molecule position @xmath6 is coupled to a one - dimensional substrate through a spring with spring constant @xmath7 . for small substrate displacements , force balance gives that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the substrate displacement , @xmath10 is the 1d mass density , and @xmath11 is the sound velocity . at a given frequency @xmath12 , the outgoing soundwaves are @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant . finding @xmath14 from ( 1 )",
    ", we can insert it into the equation of motion for @xmath6 to obtain the quality factor @xmath1 at the resonance frequency @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the molecule mass with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the mass of a wavelength long piece of the substrate . with realistic parameters for a @xmath4 molecule on a gold substrate , as was used in the experiments of ref .",
    ", the quality factor is between 1 and 10 , and therefore we expect the broadening to be substantial .",
    "this furthermore confirms the assumption that , for this type of molecular device , relaxation through the environment is much faster than through tunneling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model hamiltonian is defined in section  [ sec : model ] , and in section  [ sec : rate ] we derive an expression for the current from rate equations .",
    "the function that describes the tunneling density of states is then solved in absence of the dissipative environment in section  [ sec : without ] and with coupling to the environment in section  [ sec : with ] .",
    "we discuss different models for the dissipative coupling in section  [ sec : sigmamodel ] , where we also discuss the physical implications .",
    "section  [ sec : iv ] contains examples of @xmath2-@xmath3 curves , and finally , a summary as well as a comparison with the experiments of ref .",
    "can be found in section  [ sec : sumdis ] .",
    "we consider a model of one single spin - degenerate molecular level coupled to two leads ( generalization to more molecular levels is straightforward ) .",
    "the single level is coupled to the vibrational mode of the molecule through the charge on the dot .",
    "the coupling between the oscillator and the environment is included as a linear coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators in the spirit of the theory by caldeira and leggett .",
    "@xcite the model hamiltonian then reads @xmath20 with    [ h ] @xmath21 where the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 are creation and annihilation operators for the leads and the dot , respectively , @xmath24 is the oscillator degree of freedom , @xmath25 describes the set of environment degrees of freedom and @xmath26 , @xmath27 their respective masses and frequencies , @xmath28 is the onsite energy , and @xmath29 is the coulomb interaction on the molecule .",
    "the coupling constants between electron - oscillator and oscillator - bath are @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the lead electron energies are given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the chemical potential of lead @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the tunnel hamiltonian is @xmath35 the tunneling amplitudes could in principle also depend on the oscillator position . in the experimental realizations in refs .",
    ", this is probably a small effect since the oscillator length is of order a few pm whereas the tunneling matrix element changes on the scale of nm . for simplicity",
    ", we do not take any such non - linear effects into account , but we note that a position dependence of the tunneling amplitudes , for example of the form @xmath36 , could easily be included in the present formalism",
    ".    the force acting on the charged molecule , represented by the term @xmath37 , is caused by electric fields originating from either static impurity charges or image charges . since this force on the molecule",
    "is counteracted by a force on these charges and , hence , on the environment , we should in principle also include the interaction between the environment coordinates and the charge on the molecule .",
    "this would in fact lead to a qualitatively different behavior since ohmic dissipation is cut off at frequencies smaller than the inverse size of the total system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the inverse range of the interaction between the charge on the molecule and the charges in the environment .",
    "this interesting subtlety was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "however , since the van - der - waals interaction between molecule and the substrate is short range compared to the electrostatic forces , we will consider the force acting on the molecule as an external quantity , which is thus not coupled to the dissipative environment .",
    "we do note , however , that including such a coupling would in fact lead to a small discontinuity at the beginning of each step in the @xmath2-@xmath3 curve .",
    "the experimental data of , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref",
    ".   does not seem to suggest such a discontinuity , and we therefore specialize to the case where the environment coordinates are unaffected by the charge on the molecule .",
    "we now want to relate the coupling constants in the boson - bath coupling to the finite damping of the vibrational mode , which can be accomplished by studying the classical equations of motion . after removing the bath degrees of freedom , thereby neglecting the term @xmath38 that will be removed by a unitray transformation below , we end up with the following equation of motion in the frequency domain : @xmath39x_{0}(\\omega)=0,\\label{xeqmfreq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath40 which is complex in general and gives rise to frictional damping and a frequency shift of the bare frequency @xmath15 . in section  [ sec : realistic ] , we will explicitly calculate @xmath0 for the case of a molecule attached to a semi - infinite substrate .",
    "we eliminate the coupling term @xmath38 of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) by a unitary transformation similar to the one used in the independent boson model ,  @xcite at the cost of introducing displacement operators in the tunneling term .",
    "however , since we are dealing with a somewhat more complicated system due to the coupling to the bosonic bath , the unitary transformation in ref .   has to be generalized .",
    "we define the transformation @xmath41 where @xmath42 . using that @xmath43",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to show that the linear coupling term @xmath38 cancels if we set @xmath44},\\quad\\ell_{j}^{{}}=\\frac { -\\ell\\beta_{j}^{{}}}{m_{j}^{{}}\\omega_{j}^{2}},\\quad\\label{sdef2}\\ ] ] and the hamiltonian then transforms into @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the coulomb repulsion modified by the phonon mediated interaction . for a weak coulomb interaction , this can result in a negative effective @xmath29 , which was discussed in ref .  .",
    "we derive an expression for the current in the weak tunneling limit using the usual kinetic equation approach .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the most important assumption here is that the tunneling rate is much smaller than all other time scales , which means that we can assume the vibrational degrees of freedom and the fermi seas in the two electrodes to be in equilibrium at all times . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only two charge states and therefore let @xmath49 , which leaves us with only three states : empty , and occupied by either spin up or down .",
