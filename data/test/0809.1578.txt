    "it is customary to consider transmission function @xmath0 , which describes the incidence rate , i.e. , the number of new cases per time unit , as a main component of any epidemiological model @xcite .",
    "here we use usual notations for susceptible and infective individuals denoting them as @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . assuming that there is no influx of susceptible hosts in out model",
    ", we can write that @xmath3 historically the earliest form of the transmission function was a simple bilinear form , i.e. , @xmath4 @xcite , which follows from the assumptions of random contacts , host homogeneity , and application of the law of mass action , thereby implying that the contact rate of any individual is a linear function of the population size ( see @xcite for more details ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is the transmission coefficient . under the proportional mixing assumption (",
    "the contact rate is fixed ) , the transmission function takes the form @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a population size . if the model includes an assumption of the constant population size these two transmission functions are virtually the same from any practical viewpoint , whereas variable population size can yield dramatically different behaviors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was early acknowledged that other than bilinear or proportional mixing transmission functions should be used in epidemiological models to provide better fit of the model solutions to empirical data ( see @xcite for a general account of different models for transmission functions ) .",
    "one of the most widely used functions has the following form : @xmath8 we will term this transmission function as _ power law relationship_. it was first used in @xcite in the form @xmath9 `` to investigate the consequences of various assumptions when the laws are not known '' .",
    "severo @xcite considered general form where both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not equal to one , though he did not give a detailed analysis of the model .",
    "liu et al .",
    "@xcite gave a thorough analysis of different compartmental epidemiological models with and showed that incorporating power law transmission function yields various dynamical behaviors not observable in models with bilinear incidence rate , e.g. , limit cycles and multiple equilibrium points .",
    "additional analysis and details of such models can be found in @xcite .    since the first use of the power law transmission function",
    "its form was explained on a basis of `` intrinsic heterogeneity in mixing pattern '' of a population under question .",
    "the exponents @xmath10 and @xmath11 were dubbed as `` heterogeneity parameters '' @xcite , but the model itself is considered phenomenological and lacking mechanical derivation @xcite in contract to , e.g. , bilinear relationship , which is based on a dubious but well established law of mass action @xcite .",
    "the link between phenomenological power law incidence rate and population heterogeneity was made explicit when it was shown that such mean - field models can provide an accurate approximation to network based simulations that include variation in the strength , duration , and number of contacts per person . in @xcite the transmission function was used in the form @xmath12 , whereas full non - linear transmission function was implemented in @xcite . in both cases",
    "it was shown that power law relationship improves the accuracy of mean - field model predictions when compared with models with bilinear transmission function ( see also @xcite for a review on comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous models ) .    in this note",
    "we show that power law transmission function can be not only postulated but also derived , using a simple heterogeneous si model .",
    "the paper organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate a mechanistic heterogeneous si model from the first principles .",
    "section 3 gives a brief exposition of necessary analytical tools . in section 4",
    "we present the main results of the study showing that our heterogeneous model is equivalent to a homogeneous one , but with a non - linear transmission function .",
    "heterogeneity profoundly affects the dynamics of infection .",
    "differences in contact rates , spatial distributions of susceptible hosts , infectiousness and susceptibility of individuals have a direct effect on disease dynamics . here",
    ", we specifically look into heterogeneity in disease parameters ( such as susceptibility ) do not touching an important topics of heterogeneity mediated by a structured variable , such as explicit space or age structure .",
    "our approach is close to the one given in , e.g. , @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details ) .",

    "the total size of the susceptibles is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the set of parameter values .",
    "assuming that the subpopulation of the infectives is homogeneous ( later we relax this assumption ) , the contact process is described with the law of mass action , and the rate of change in the susceptibles is determined by transmission parameter , which is a function of @xmath15 , we obtain that @xmath18 here @xmath19 incorporates information on the contact rate and the probability of a successful contact .",
    "the change in the infective class is given by @xmath20 where we denote @xmath21 therefore , @xmath22 is the mean value of the function @xmath19 with respect to probability density function @xmath23 for any time @xmath14 .",
    "we need the initial conditions for the model , : @xmath24 here @xmath25 are given numbers , and @xmath26 is a given initial distribution of the susceptibility in the population .",
    "we note that formally , after integrating equation with respect to @xmath15 , we obtain a homogeneous si model with non - constant transmission parameter @xmath22 which , in its turn , depends on the current distribution of susceptibility in the population . if @xmath22 is known then the problem is solved .",

    "the number of susceptibles with the trait value @xmath31 infected by individuals with trait value @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 , and the total change in the infective class with trait value @xmath32 is @xmath34 ; an analogous expression applies to the change in the susceptible population .",
