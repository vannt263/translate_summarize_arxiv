    "the nature of the dark matter in the universe is one of the outstanding questions in astro / particle physics .",
    "one of the favored candidates is the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) particle .",
    "such a particle is weakly interacting and massive ( with mass in the range 1 gev ",
    "few tev ) , and hence is frequently characterized as a wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the lightest susy particle in most cases is the lightest neutralino , a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , @xmath3 boson , and neutral - higgs bosons , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the supersymmetric partners of the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath7 and of the third component of the su(2 ) gauge field @xmath8 that mix to make the photon and @xmath3 boson .",
    "( we will also use the letter @xmath9 for @xmath10 . )",
    "much work has been done studying the possibilities for detecting these particles .",
    "possibilities include direct detection @xcite , whereby the particle interacts with a nucleon in a low temperature detector , and is identified by the kev of energy it deposits in the nucleon ; and indirect detection , whereby ( 1 ) the particles are captured in the sun or earth , sink to the center of the sun or earth , annihilate with one another in the core , and give rise to particles including neutrinos which can be detected by experiments on the surface of the earth @xcite , or ( 2 ) the particles annihilate in the galactic halo and produced anomalous components in the flux of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the interaction processes of the lightest susy particle are clearly of great importance in calculations of predicted rates for both direct and indirect detection .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the effect of cp violation on the neutralino annihilation and scattering cross sections .",
    "the mssm introduces several new phases in the theory which are absent in the standard model .",
    "supplemented by a universality condition at the grand unification scale , only two of these are independent . in this case , one may choose to work in a basis in which the two non - trivial cp - violating phases reside in @xmath11 and the universal soft trilinear coupling @xmath2 of the higgs fields to the scalar fermions @xmath12 .",
    "previously falk , ferstl and olive @xcite have considered the effect on neutralino cross sections of a nonzero phase of @xmath11 , the mixing mass parameter involving the two higgs chiral superfields in the superpotential . here , on the other hand , we consider the effect on neutralino cross sections of the case where the soft trilinear scalar couplings @xmath13 are all complex numbers , where subscript @xmath14 refers to the quarks . to be specific , we will take @xmath15 with arbitrary @xmath16 , and we take @xmath17 . in part of susy parameter space",
    "we find enhancement of these cross sections , and hence an increase in direct and indirect detection rates ; while in other parts of parameter space the cross sections are suppressed .",
    "the phase of @xmath2 enters into the neutralino cross sections in two places : 1 ) into the squark masses , and 2 ) into the higgs sector .",
    "for example , one of the processes that contributes to neutralino annihilation is s - channel exchange of the three neutral higgs bosons , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath2 , into final state fermions .",
    "( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the first two of these neutral higgs bosons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are cp even , while @xmath2 is cp odd .",
    "the new aspect considered here is the possibility of mixing between the cp - even higgs scalars ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and the cp - odd scalar @xmath2 .",
    "this mixing was first studied by pilaftsis @xcite , who found that the size of cp violation can be fairly large , i.e.  of order one , for a range of kinematic parameters preferred by susy .",
    "he found that a large @xmath20 mixing can naturally occur within two - higgs doublet models either at the tree level , if one adds softly cp - violating breaking terms to the higgs potential , or at one loop , after integrating out heavy degrees of freedom that break the cp invariance of the higgs sector , such as heavy majorana neutrinos . in any case , in this paper , we consider the one - loop effects of @xmath21 on scattering and annihilation cross sections relevant to direct and indirect detection .    in section",
    "ii we discuss our general approach . in section iii , we discuss the squark sector , and in section iv , the higgs sector . in section",
    "v , we discuss experimental constraints on the parameters .",
    "we present our results in section vi .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model provides a well - defined calculational framework@xcite , but contains at least 106 yet - unmeasured parameters  @xcite .",
    "most of them control details of the squark and slepton sectors , and can safely be disregarded in dark matter studies .",
    "so similarly to bergstrm and gondolo  @xcite , we restrict the number of parameters to 6 plus one cp violating phase : the `` cp - odd '' scalar mass @xmath22 ( which in our cp violating scenario is just a mass parameter ) , the higgs mass parameter @xmath11 , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath23 ( we impose gaugino mass unification ) , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath24 , a sfermion mass parameter @xmath25 ( not to be confused with the sfermion mass , see eqs .",
    "( [ sq - assume ] ) and  ( [ msquark ] ) below ) , and a complex sfermion mixing parameter @xmath26 for the third generation ( we set the @xmath2 s of the first two generations to zero ) .",
    "the phase of @xmath2 is the only cp violating phase we introduce besides the standard model ckm phase .",
    "we use the database of points in parameter space built in refs .",
    "@xcite , setting their @xmath27 equal to @xmath28 .",
    "hence we explore a substantial fraction of the supersymmetry parameter space , running through different possible neutralinos as the lightest susy particle .",
    "we modify the squark and higgs couplings in the neutralino dark matter code darksusy @xcite to include a non - zero phase of @xmath2 .",
    "we also add all diagrams that contribute to neutralino scattering and annihilation and would vanish when cp is conserved .",
    "to investigate the effects of the phase of @xmath2 , we perform the following procedure . for each of the 132,887 sets of parameter values in the database , we run through 50 values of the phase of @xmath2 , so that we effectively explore @xmath29 models .",
    "we loop over a circle with @xmath16 varying from 0 to @xmath30 . at each point",
    ", we check bounds on the electric dipole moment , on the higgs mass , on other particle masses , on the @xmath31 branching ratio , and on the invisible z width ( table i gives a listing of the bounds we apply ) . if any of these bounds are violated , we move to the next point on the circle . if all the bounds are satisfied , we calculate the spin - independent neutralino ",
    "proton scattering cross section @xmath32 .",
    "we record the two values of the phase of @xmath2 where @xmath33 is highest and lowest , respectively , with the bounds satisfied .",
    "then , once we have looped through all the possible values for the phase of @xmath2 , we have found the two points with the maximum enhancement and suppression of the scattering cross section .",
    "we then compare with the scattering cross section in the case of no cp violation .",
    "we do the same for the annihilation cross section times relative velocity @xmath34 at relative velocity @xmath35 ( we recall that @xmath36 as @xmath37 ) .",

    "specifically we have considered the case in which the only cp violating phase in addition to the standard model ckm phase is in the complex soft trilinear scalar couplings @xmath2 of the third generation .",
    "this phase affects the squark masses and through radiative corrections generates a mixing between cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons .",
    "this mixing modifies the neutralino annihilation and scattering cross sections in the kinematic regimes relevant for dark matter detection .",
    "exploring @xmath161 points in supersymmetric parameter space with a non - zero phase of @xmath2 , we have found that : ( 1 ) the scattering cross section is generally suppressed , even by 7 orders of magnitude in special cases ; ( 2 ) the annihilation cross section can be enhanced by factors of @xmath0 as resonant neutralino annihilation through a higgs boson becomes possible at cp - violating values of the phase of @xmath2 .",
