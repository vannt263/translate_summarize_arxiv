    "measurements of the cmb by experiments before cobe , by cobe itself , and by subsequent experiments , have already amassed an impressive amount of data  @xcite , and this is set to grow dramatically with future experiments culminating in the map and planck surveyer satellites .",
    "we already know that the spectrum is very close to black - body , which imposes important constraints on entropy deposition , late particle decays , reionization , etc .",
    "we also know that the cmb is highly isotropic , providing the best evidence for the relevance of friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "this isotropy immediately raises the horizon problem : why is the universe apparently so homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ?",
    "it is worth recalling that the scale size of the universe at the epoch of last scattering is about two orders of magnitude larger than the horizon size @xmath0 at that epoch @xmath1 , which is the largest distance over which a message could have travelled in a conventional frw cosmology .",
    "so how were the opposite sides of the universe able to coordinate so precisely ?",
    "small anisotropies in the cmb have been seen : the first to be discovered was the dipole anisotropy of about @xmath2 , which is conventionally interpreted as a dppler effect due to the velocity of the earth in the machian reference frame provided by the cmb  @xcite .",
    "more recently , cobe and its successors have detected the higher - order anisotropies shown in fig .",
    "1  @xcite , which promise to teach us a lot of fundamental physics .",
    "these anisotropies are usually interpreted in the context of cosmological inflation  @xcite , according to which , at some very early epoch , the energy density @xmath3 of the universe may have been dominated by an ( almost ) constant term @xmath4 : ( a a)^2 = 8g_n 3  -   ka^2  :   v [ one ] it is easy to see that , if this constant term were dominant , it would generate an epoch of exponential growth of the scale factor @xmath5 : a a_i  ( h  ( t - t_i ) )  :  h = [ two ] where @xmath6 at the initial time @xmath7 marking the onset of inflation . if so , the horizon size @xmath8 of the universe would also have expanded exponentially , and the entire observable universe would have been born within the pre - inflationary horizon : a = a_i  e^h(t - t_i ) 2 t  even  if   a_i 2t_i [ three ] during this epoch of exponential expansion , the ( approximate ) homogeneity and isotropy of the observable universe could have been imprinted .",
    "moreover , the curvature term @xmath9 in ( [ one ] ) would rapidly have become negligible , so that the universe would become almost critical : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , unwanted particles from the very early universe , such as gut monopoles  @xcite , would have been inflated away beyond the last - scattering surface of the cmb .    in this picture , the cmb anisotropies are ascribed to density fluctuations originating from quantum fluctuations  @xcite in the scalar field whose potential energy @xmath12 drove inflation .",
    "these fluctuations would have induced perturbations in the field energy in different parts of the universe , evolving subsequently into fluctuations in the temperature of the cmb",
    ". these would be ( approximately ) a gaussian random field of perturbation @xmath13 , with similar magnitudes on different scale sizes , as favoured by astrophysicists .",
    "the magnitude of these perturbations is related to the field energy density during inflation ~ ^2  g_n [ four ] the magnitude @xmath14 observed by cobe et seq .",
    "favours @xmath15 gev , comparable with the unification scale in guts  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the very least , inflation provides with a unique window through which we can look back at an energy scale far beyond the direct reach of current accelerators , and might even provide us with a precious window on guts themselves . a challenge which has not yet been fully met",
    ", however , is to derive an inflationary potential from some gut ( or string ) theory in a natural way .",
    "the large mass scale @xmath16 associated with inflation suggests that observations of the cmb may be sensitive to all mass scales in physics , not excluding that associated with quantum gravity , which may not be so far beyond @xmath17 , if current @xmath18-theory ideas are right .",
    "indeed , examples can easily be given of the cmb s sensitivity to aspects of * quantum  gravity*. in addition to the scalar density perturbations ( [ one ] ) that are expected to dominate the cmb anisotropies , there may also be tensor perturbation modes , which are none other than _ gravitational waves_. _ string cosmology _ scenarios have been proposed  @xcite , of which these may provide a key observational signature . then we should recall that it is the combination of cmb data with those on high - redshift supernovae  @xcite that provides the clearest evidence for a _ cosmological constant _",
    "@xmath19 , as discussed in more detail later .",
    "the interpretation of these observations corresponds to @xmath20 @xmath21 , which is far smaller than the individual contributions to @xmath19 in many particle theories .",
    "for example , condensates in the qcd vacuum yield _",
    "qcd~(100  mev)^4 ~10 ^ -80  m^4_p  , [ five ] the higgs vacuum of the standard model contributes _",
    "ew~(100  mev)^4 ~10 ^ -68  m^4_p  , [ six ] and global supersymmetry breaking might contribute _ s ( 1  tev)^4 ~10 ^ -64  m^4_p  , [ seven ] the discrepancy between these estimates and the ( inferred ) astrophysical value may be the biggest problem in particle physics , much bigger even than the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "its resolution certainly requires a consistent quantum theory of gravity that also includes all the other particle interactions .",
    "personally , i regard the observational indications for non - zero vacuum energy as a tremendous opportunity for theoretical physics , as it provides a number to calculate in one s candidate theory of quantum gravity .",
    "much effort has been applied to trying to prove that @xmath22  @xcite , but a corresponding exact unbroken symmetry has not been identified .",
    "perhaps @xmath23 after all ? or perhaps it is merely relaxing towards zero : @xmath24 with a non - trivial equation of state : @xmath25 ?",
    "present data require @xmath26  @xcite , but do not impose @xmath27 as required if @xmath19 is constant .",
    "models in which @xmath28 include a mobile scalar field @xmath29 ( quintessence ) whose potential energy @xmath30  @xcite , and gradual de - excitation of the quantum - gravity vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the cmb and other data may eventually be able to make interesting distinctions between possible equations of state , and thereby discriminate between different theories of quantum gravity .",
    "as for * grand unification * , a primary hope is that the vacuum energy driving inflation could be related to the _ gut scalar potential_. the cmb may also cast light on the magnitudes of the _ neutrino masses _ expected in guts .",
    "laboratory experiments have established that these must be much smaller than the masses @xmath31 of the charged leptons and quarks  @xcite : m__e & & 2.5  ev ,   + m _ _ & & 160  kev ,   + m _ _ & & 18  mev  . [",
    "eight ] theorists expect non - zero neutrino masses , because there are no candidate exact gauge symmetries with associated conserved charges to forbid them , by analogy with the @xmath32 of qed , with its associated conserved @xmath33 and vanishing photon mass .",
    "we expect the other apparently conserved quantum numbers such baryon number @xmath34 and lepton number @xmath35 eventually to be violated , most likely at some high mass scale @xmath36 .",
    "lepton - number violation leads generically to neutrino masses .",
    "most theorists expect a see - saw mass matrix mixing the known @xmath37 with heavy singlet neutrinos @xmath38 ( often called right - handed neutrinos , but i dislike this nomenclature ) of the form  @xcite ( _ l , n )  ( )  ( ) [ nine ] whose diagonalization yields m_~m^2 m m ~m_l , q [ ten ] for example , if we put @xmath39 100 gev and take @xmath40 ev for the third generation , we estimate @xmath41 gev .",
    "recent evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations suggests  @xcite m^2_a ~(10 ^ -2  to   10 ^ -3 )",
    "ev^2 [ eleven ] for the mass - squared difference between one pair of mass eigenstates @xmath42 . the range ( [ eleven ] ) can be explored with approved and projected long - baseline neutrino experiments with accelerator beams  @xcite .",
    "in addition , solar neutrino data have for some time suggested  @xcite m^2_s ~(10 ^ -5  or   10 ^ -10 )  ev^2 [ twelve ] for the mass - squared difference between another pair .",
    "these are not measurements of the absolute scale of neutrino masses , but most models suggest that the neutrinos are _ not _ heavy and almost degenerate , and hence that m__1&~&(10 ^ -1  to   10 ^ -3/2 )  ev > + m__2 & ~ & ( 10 ^ -5/2  or   10 ^ -5 )  ev > m__3 [ thirteen ] for the three mass eigenstates .",
    "as is discussed below , the cmb and large - scale structure data may eventually provide the best constraint on the expected hierarchy ( 13 ) .",
    "another possible output of grand unification that will be constrained by cmb measurements is _",
    "baryogenesis_. already @xmath43 ( and hence @xmath44 ) is being bounded by present cmb measurements  @xcite , and these may eventually povide the most accurate determination of @xmath43 , for comparison with baryogenesis scenarios at the gut or electroweak scale  @xcite , or in between .",
    "another possible extension of the standard model that may be tested by cmb measurements is * supersymmetry *  @xcite .",
    "this is invoked  @xcite by particle theorists to stabilize the gauge hierarchy : @xmath45 , or equivalently @xmath46 , or equivalently @xmath47 inside an atom .",
    "if one tries to set such a hierarchy by hand , one discovers large quantum corrections : m^2_w = o ( )  ^2 [ forteen ] which are much larger than the physical value of @xmath48 if the cutoff @xmath19 in ( [ forteen ] ) is @xmath49 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "an effective cutoff @xmath19 is provided by sparticle masses in supersymmetric models : m^2_w = o ( )  m^2_b - m^2_f[fifteen ] where the subscripts ( @xmath50 ) denote superpartner bosons and fermions , and the remainder is @xmath51 if m^2_b - m^2_f1  tev^2 [ sixteen ] this motivates the appearance of superpartners at energies accessible to accelerators such as the lhc  @xcite . as discussed below , it also suggests the presence of massive supersymmetric relic particles contributing @xmath52(1 ) to the matter density @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "cmb measurements already bound @xmath53 , and may soon provide accurate measurements of it , thereby constraining supersymmetric models .",
    "subsequent epochs of the history of the universe , such as the * electroweak phase transition * , the quark - hadron * qcd phase transition * and cosmological * nucleosynthesis * will also be constrained by cmb measurements , but we do not go into details here .",
    "we phrase our subsequent discussion in terms of the density budget of the universe , expressed relative to the critical density : @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 : inflation suggests that this is practically indistinguishable from unity : @xmath56 , but there are models that predict @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "one of these is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , which has the potential    v = m^2 ^ 22  z  ( 1+^2 ^ 2+(-v)^2 ) :  v [ seventeen ] this looks rather bizarre , but who knows what _ a priori _ probability measure the inflationary god uses , or even whether such a concept makes sense  @xcite ? as seen in fig .",
    "2b , this model predicts a spectrum of density perturbations that is far from flat  @xcite , and hence amenable to test by cmb measurements .",

    "@xmath67 : the theory of large - scale structure formation strongly suggests that most of @xmath53 is cold dark matter , so that _ cdm ~_m [ twentytwo ] as perhaps provided by supersymmetric particles .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is expected to be stable in most models , and hence present in the universe today as a cosmological relic from the big bang  @xcite .",
    "its stability would be due to a multiplicatively - conserved quantum number , called @xmath68 parity , which is related to baryon number @xmath34 , lepton number @xmath35 and spin @xmath69 : b = ( -1)^3b+l+2s [ twentythree ] and takes the value + 1 for all conventional particles , changing to -1 for all supersymmetric particles , because they have identical internal properties but spins differing by half a unit .",
    "there are three important consequences of @xmath68 conservation : ( i ) sparticles are always produced in pairs , such as @xmath70 or @xmath71 , ( ii ) heavier sparticles decay into lighter ones , such as @xmath72 or @xmath73 , and ( iii ) the lightest sparticle is stable because it has no legal decay mode .    in many models",
    "@xcite , the favoured scandidate for the lightest sparticle is the lightest neutralino @xmath74 , which is a mixture of the photino @xmath75 , the zino @xmath76 and the neutral higgsinos @xmath77  @xcite . at the tree level ,",
    "the neutralinos are characterized by three parameters : the unmixed gaugino mass @xmath78 , a higgsino mixing parameter @xmath16 and @xmath79 , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "the properties of the @xmath74 particle simplify in the limit @xmath80 , where it becomes an almost pure photino @xmath75 , and in the limit @xmath81 , where it becomes almost a pure higgsino @xmath82 .",

    "these considerations currently yield  @xcite m_42  gev [ twentyfour ] and subsequent lep runs should be able to explore thoroughly the range @xmath88 50 gev .    although theorists of structure formation prefer most of the dark matter to be composed of cold non - relativistic particles , such as neutralinos , they think this may not be the whole story , as seen in fig .",

    "the first generation of cmb measurements has already taught us a great deal about fundamental physics  @xcite , some of which has already been mentioned in previous sections .",
    "most of the discussion is in terms of inflationary models , but it should not be forgotten that the cmb delivered a death blow to the alternative models based on cosmological defects  @xcite .",
    "these did not predict    an acoustic peak , as apparently observed in the data at a harmonic number @xmath105 200 , as suggested by the data compiled in fig .",

    "as has already been mentioned , standard cold dark matter does not fit the cmb and large - scale structure data , but a model with @xmath110 does .",
    "furthermore , the indications from the cmb and large - scale structure data are that the spectral index of the density perturbations @xmath111 , in agreement with the harrison - zeldovich spectrum and most inflationary models .",
    "thus , we have reached the stage where alternative theories of structure formation have been , or are being , eliminated , and attention is being focussed on a candidate standard model of structure formation .",
    "the next step is test the model , determine its parameters , and try to over - constrain them , with the hope of eventually moving beyond it .",
    "the next generation of cmb measurements , culminating in the map and planck satellites , will provide us with precision determinations of physical quantities , and probe the emerging standard model of structure formation , much as lep and the slc have probed the standard model of particle physics . for example , @xmath55 may be determined with a precision of 0.1 , possibly 0.01 in combination with high - redshift supernova data , in conjunction with a comparable precision in @xmath53 . similarly , @xmath112 will be determined with a small fractional error . in the case of lep , many quantities such as @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the number of light neutrino species @xmath115 were eventually determined with errors far smaller than theoretical guesses before the accelerator started .",
    "for that reason , i am not going to hazard here many guesses about the eventual errors in cosmological parameters !",
    "however , let us consider neutrinos as an example of what may be possible .",

    "cmb measurements take inflationary models into the scientifc domain : individual models may be falsified , and even very general classes of models , for example by observing strong non - gaussian correlations .",
    "a word of caution is , however , in order . like any finite - size set of measurements",
    ", the cmb measurements alone will not have a unique interpretation  the so - called cosmological degeneracy problem .",
    "specifically , models with the same stress history will give the same pattern of acoustic peaks in the cmb spectrum and the same perturbation power spectrum .",
    "other measurements sensitive to the co - moving sound speed and curvature fluctuations would be needed to distinguish between models .",
    "the cmb is a powerful probe of fundamental physics , including quantum gravity , inflation , grand unification , cold dark matter , hot dark matter , decaying particles , big - bang baryosynthesis and much else besides , as well as being of capital importance for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "it is one of the very few probes we have of physics at the grand unification scale , along with neutrino physics , as can be probed using long - baseline neutrino experiments  @xcite , and the measurements of gauge couplings and particle masses , e.g. , of sparticles at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "hence the future generation of cmb experiments , notably map and particularly planck , is an invaluable complement to the next generation of particle accelerator experiments at the lhc .",
