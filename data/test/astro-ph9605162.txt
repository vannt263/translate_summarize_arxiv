    "there is a mounting evidence that the galactic bulge is a triaxial structure , or a bar .",
    "this was first postulated by de vaucouleurs  ( 1964 ) , based on similarities between the kinematics of the gas observed towards the galactic center and in other barred galaxies . however , the hypothesis that our galaxy is a barred galaxy was for a long time overshadowed by `` @xmath4 expanding arm '' hypothesis , despite a number of papers arguing for bar s presence ( e.g. peters 1975 ; liszt & burton 1980 ; gerhard & vietri 1986 ) .",
    "only recently has the view of our galaxy as a barred spiral gained momentum , mostly due to the work of blitz & spergel ( 1991 ) .",
    "they analyzed @xmath5 observations of the galactic center and showed convincingly that the observed asymmetry in the galactic longitude distribution of surface brightness is naturally explained by the bar with the near side in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "binney et al .  (",
    "1991 ) have constructed a dynamical model for gas in the inner galaxy , and their resulting bar has the same orientation as that suggested by blitz & spergel  ( 1991 ) in the sense that the closer part of the bar is at positive galactic longitudes .",
    "cobe - dirbe multiwavelength observations of the galactic center ( weiland et al .",
    "1994 ) confirmed the existence of the longitudinal asymmetry discussed by blitz & spergel  ( 1991 ) .",
    "this data was used by dwek et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to constrain a number of analytical bar models existing in the literature .",
    "star counts have also shown evidence for triaxial structure in the center of the galaxy .",
    "nakada et al .",
    "( 1991 ) analyzed the distribution of iras galactic bulge stars and found asymmetry in the same sense as blitz & spergel  ( 1991 ) .",
    "whitelock & catchpole  ( 1992 ) analyzed the number distribution of mira variables in the bulge as a function of distance modulus and found that the half of the bulge which is at positive galactic longitude is closer to us than the other half .",
    "the observed stellar distribution could be modelled with a bar inclined at roughly @xmath6 to the line of sight .",
    "weinberg  ( 1992 ) used agb stars as star tracers and mapped the galaxy inside the solar circle .",
    "he found evidence for a large stellar bar with semimajor axis of @xmath7 and inclination placing the nearer side of the bar at positive galactic longitudes .",
    "a third thread of evidence comes from the gravitational microlensing towards the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .  1994 ; alcock et al .  1995 ; alard et al . 1995 ) . observed high microlensing rate can be accounted for by stars placed in the near part of the galactic bar microlensing the stars from the far side of the bar ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 ; paczyski et al .",
    "1994b ; zhao , spergel & rich 1995 ) .",
    "there are many implications if this scenario is correct , discussed latter in this paper . for recent reviews on the galactic bar",
    "see gerhard ( 1996 ) and kuijken ( 1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we use a color - magnitude data obtained by the optical gravitational lensing experiment collaboration for 12 fields scattered across the galactic bulge to construct the three - dimensional model of the mass distribution in the galactic bar . the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle , udalski et al .  1993 ; 1994 )",
    "is an extensive photometric search for the rare cases of gravitational microlensing of galactic bulge stars by foreground stars , brown dwarfs and planets .",
    "it provides a huge database ( szymaski & udalski 1993 ) , from which color - magnitude diagrams have been compiled ( udalski et al .",
    "stanek et al .",
    "( 1994 ; 1996 ) used the well - defined population of bulge red clump stars to investigate the presence of the bar in our galaxy . comparing extinction - adjusted apparent magnitudes of the red clump giants observed at fields lying at @xmath8",
    ", we found that the red clump stars lying at the positive galactic longitudes are systematically brighter by @xmath9 than the stars lying at negative @xmath1 .",
    "a bar - shaped bulge whose nearer side is at the positive galactic longitude most easily explains this offset . this agrees with blitz & spergel  ( 1991 ) and other works .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the basis for using the red clump stars as a distance indicator . in section 3",
    "we discuss the data used for the bar modelling . in section 4",
    "we discuss various analytical models of the bar . in section 5",
    "we constrain these models using our data . in section 6",
    "we discuss various factors which might affect the fits . in section 7",
    "we discuss some astrophysical implications of the constructed models , among the others for the gravitational microlensing optical depth .",
    "before we model the galactic bar using red clump stars , we shall discuss the evidence that the red clump stars would be a good distance indicator for the galactic bulge population .",
    "red clump stars are the equivalent of the horizontal branch stars for a metal rich population , i.e. relatively low mass stars burning helium in their cores . from stellar evolution theory ( e.g. seidel , demarque & weinberg 1987 ; castellani , chieffi & straniero 1992 ) we expect the red clump stars to have a narrow luminosity distribution with weak dependence on age and the metallicity . for given",
    "metallicity and helium abundance , the total difference in mean clump luminosity for ages between 1 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( seidel et al .",
    "the effect of metallicity on red clump giants luminosity and color is also relatively weak ( see sarajedini , lee & lee 1995 , their figs.4,5 ) . therefore , red clump stars form a suitable population with which to investigate the properties of high - metallicity systems , like the galactic bulge .",
    "because of high and variable interstellar extinction towards the galactic bulge , we use extinction - adjusted parameter @xmath12 in our analysis ( see eq.1 ) .",
    "we would like to be able to say something about the intrinsic width of the red clump population .",
    "for that , we use @xmath13 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the globular cluster 47 tuc obtained by one of the authors ( jk ) using 2.5-meter dupont telescope at the las campanas observatory .",
    "these cmds are described in more detail by kauny & wysocka ( 1996 ) .",
    "47 tuc is a metal rich globular cluster with @xmath14\\approx-0.7 $ ] ( zinn & west 1984 ) and age of @xmath15 ( sarajedini et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we first construct a histogram of @xmath12 values for stars in the red clump dominated region of the 47 tuc cmd ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the definition of the @xmath12 parameter causes that , along with the red clumps giants we are interested in , also stars from the red giant branch which happen to have the same values of @xmath12 are included into histogram .",
    "the resulting peak in the luminosity function is quite narrow  for comparison we plotted a gaussian with @xmath16 .",
    "we want also to be able to estimate what are the effects of possible metallicity spread ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; minniti et al .",
    "1995 ) on the red clump width . to do so , we selected one of baade s window fields observed by ogle , bw4 , which has relatively uniform extinction ( see stanek 1996 ) .",
    "we than shifted the cmd of 47 tuc to match the location of the red clumps giants in the bw4 .",
    "this is shown in the upper part of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we then plotted the histogram of @xmath17 color for red giant branch stars from both the cluster and the bw4 field ( fig.[fig2 ] , lower part ) .",
    "the red giant branch of 47 tuc is very narrow , @xmath18 , and it is much broader for the bw4 field , with @xmath19 .",
    "this combined with the @xmath16 measured in the previous paragraph gives us the intrinsic width of the red clump giants population in the galactic bulge @xmath20 .",
    "we will use this number later in this paper .",
    "we use a color - magnitude data obtained by the optical gravitational lensing experiment collaboration for 12 fields scattered across the galactic bulge to construct the 3-d model of the mass distribution in the galactic bar .",
    "the schematic map of the fields location in the galactic coordinates is shown in fig.[fig3 ] and the coordinates of the fields are given in table  1 .",
    "we use 10 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from udalski et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( fields bw1 - 6 , mm5-b , mm7-ab , tp8 ) and two cmds obtained last year specifically for the current project ( fields gb11 , gb13 ) . all the data were obtained using the 1-meter swope telescope at the las campanas observatory , operated by the carnegie institution of washington , and @xmath21 ford / loral ccd detector with the pixel size 0.44 arcsec covering @xmath22 field of view .",
    "we did not use fields bw7 and bwc of udalski et al .",
    "( 1993 ) because they each contain a globular cluster , which could potentially contaminate our star counts .",
    "we also excluded fields bw8 and mm5-a because of very strong ccd bleeding columns caused by bright stars .",
    "most of each cmd is dominated by bulge stars , with a distinct red clump , red giant , and turn - off point stars .",

    "also , there is visible in fig.[fig7 ] clear trend in the sense that for larger @xmath50 given analytical model has larger inclination angle @xmath35 .",
    "this trend was to some extent expected : to fit the observed data , the models with larger @xmath50 have to have smaller depth along the line of sight , which for triaxial objects decreases with increasing inclination angle . for the preferred value of @xmath55 (",

    "the horizontal spread along the @xmath71-axis for each @xmath50 was done for the clarity of the presentation , as in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "let us first discuss the ratio @xmath78 , i.e. the ratio of the bar major axis to the minor axis lying in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this ratio for all the models does not change significantly with @xmath50 and is between @xmath79 , except for the e1 model with @xmath80 , for which @xmath81 .",
    "this is a very tight constraint , again much tighter than @xmath82 obtained by dwek et al . from cobe - dirbe data",
    "( see also their fig.5 ) .",
    "on the other hand , there is a clear trend between @xmath83 and @xmath50 in the sense that for larger @xmath50 given analytical model has smaller axis ratio @xmath83 .",
    "this was somewhat expected : as we increase the @xmath50 , @xmath61 must decrease to fit the data , but we expect that @xmath84 would remain approximately the same , since @xmath84 is the scale length perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and it is not strongly affected by `` rotating '' the bar . also , the scatter of @xmath83 for different models is bigger than in case of @xmath78 . for the preferred value of @xmath55 , @xmath83 is between @xmath85 , again with the exception of e1 model , for which it is @xmath86 .",
    "judging from the map of the observed fields ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , one could be worried that most of the constraint we have on the @xmath84 comes from the tp8 field , in which there are very few red clump stars ( fig.[fig4 ] and table  1 ) .",
    "this is however not the case : even within baade s window there is a clear gradient , in the number of the red clump stars , with the distance from the galactic center .",
    "the bw1 field has about 40% more red clump stars than the bw3 field .",
    "in fact , we run a series of fits without the tp8 field and the resulting models were very close to what we present in this paper .",
    "there is evidence from the gas kinematics pointing to the fact that the centroid of the gas emission from the galactic bar is offset at @xmath87 ( blitz 1995 ; weinberg 1996 ) .",

    "this is not simply an effect of having one additional parameter ",
    "the tilt angle @xmath39 had hardly any effect on our models .",
    "we conclude by saying that our results are suggestive of a small ( @xmath90 ) centroid offset of the galactic bar .",
    "one could in principle introduce another additional parameter describing the centroid offset in the @xmath91 direction . with current data , however , we have only one field at positive galactic latitude , which provides very little lever arm to constrain an offset in @xmath91 .",
    "we thus make no attempt to include it in our models .",
    "in the previous section we fitted various analytical models to the luminosity function of the bulge red clumps stars and obtained the parameters of the 3-d mass distribution of the galactic bar . this procedure is subject to possible various systematic errors , which we discuss in some detail below",
    ".      one obvious disadvantage of the whole procedure described in the previous section is that we fit only a number of selected analytical functions describing the 3-d light ( mass ) distribution of the galactic bar .",
    "indeed , high value of the formal @xmath59 we obtained even for our best - fit model  p1 with @xmath55 and 8 free parameters has @xmath92  suggests that we either underestimate our errors ( which were taken to be poissonian @xmath93 ) or the galactic bar 3-d mass distribution is described by some other triaxial function or most probably is only roughly described by an analytical function .",
    "nevertheless , by following dwek et al .",
    "approach and fitting a whole set of different analytical functions with different properties we showed we can retrieve successfully at least some of the galactic bar properties .",
    "for example , it is clear from fig.[fig7 ] that the inclination angle of the bar to the line of sight @xmath35 does not depend strongly on the model we fit and is affected stronger by the assumed value of the intrinsic width of the red clump @xmath50 .    to investigate to some extent",
    "how strong the effect of fitting an improper analytical function is on the fitted parameters , we generated artificial random histograms of the @xmath12 distributions using the e2 model .",
    "we then fitted this artificial data using all nine different analytical functions used in this paper . in table  4",
    "we show both the parameters of the input model ( first row ) and the fitted parameters of all nine models . for reasons discussed in the previous section , instead of @xmath94 scale lengths",
    "we show the axis ratios @xmath95 , as these are more relevant for comparing the agreement between the models .    as can be seen in table  4 , agreement in the fitted inclination angle",
    "is very good .",
    "the e1 model deviates most from the input @xmath96 , but this is also true when fitting to the real data .",
    "this only reconfirms our strong conviction that we can constrain the inclination angle @xmath35 of the bar very well .",
    "the @xmath97 axis ratio is also recovered remarkably well . as to the @xmath98 axis ratio , except for the e1 model ,",
    "it is also well recovered by all other models .",
    "we conclude by saying that all the models we use , except for the e1 model , can be used to recover the parameters of the galactic bar with similar fidelity .",
    "it is possible that we detect red clump giants with different efficiency among the 12 fields we use in this paper .",
    "this could affect some of the parameters we fit , some stronger than others , for example inclination angle of the bar probably would not depend very strongly on this effect , but the axis ratios probably would .",
    "red clump stars we use in our analysis are always well above the detection threshold , @xmath99 in @xmath100 , so we do not expect a strong variation in efficiency among the fields . looking at fields which are adjacent ( like bw1 and bw5 or the two mm7 fields ) we generally find that the histograms of @xmath12 values are similar for these fields ( fig.[fig4 ] and table  1 ) .",
    "there are two levels on which stars can be lost : the ccd detection and the construction of a cmd from @xmath101 and @xmath100 databases .",
    "udalski et al .  (",
    "1993 ) addressed the question of ccd star detection efficiency by placing artificial stars on the ccd and then retrieving them through the standard ogle data pipeline .",
    "they found that the ccd detection efficiency in the interesting us magnitude range is roughly constant and is about @xmath102 , which would not change the parameters of the fit we are interested in .",
    "we therefore make no correction for the ccd detection efficiency .",
    "the other reason that some stars are not included in the cmd is that the star photometry is not good enough to pass a corresponding criterion .",
    "udalski et al .  (",
    "1993 ) used rather stringent photometric quality constrains on what stars can qualify to be included in the cmd , so only about 60% of stars from the @xmath103 databases are finally included .",
    "these constrains are however the same for all the fields , so we neglect that in our fitting procedure .",
    "one can imagine that a large scale gradient in the reddening law could explain the systematic shift of the red clump giants in magnitude with the galactic longitude , which we discuss in this and earlier works ( stanek et al .  1994 ; 1996 ) .",
    "this would cause @xmath12 defined by eq.[eq : free ] to be invalid globally .",
    "however , woniak and stanek  ( 1996 ) found no such gradient .",
    "what they could not exclude were smaller variations of this coefficient among various fields , but again , inspection of fig.[fig4 ] shows a good agreement in red clump peak position for fields located at the approximately same position , like the bw fields .",
    "even fields mm7 and gb13 , located at approximately the same galactic @xmath1 , but on opposite sides of the galactic plane ( table  1 ) , have practically the same red clump peak position ( fig.[fig4 ] ) , even that the gb13 field has somewhat higher extinction then the mm7 fields .",
    "as we select a region of the cmd and then use all stars in this region to construct a luminosity function , we may expect some contamination from stars located in the galactic disk .",
    "stanek et al .  ( 1994 ) considered this problem using bahcall & soneira  ( 1980 ) model of the galactic disk and found the contamination to be negligible ( see stanek s et al .",
    "this is because in the region corresponding to red clump giants we expect only either bright and nearby , or evolved disk stars , of which there are very few .    a related problem : our star counts could also be contaminated by stars from the metal poor stellar spheroid .",
    "we do not account for this population , having already 89 free parameters in our fit .",
    "however , this should be negligible , just as was contamination by disk stars .",
    "red clump becomes weak quite rapidly , as seen from @xmath104 histogram of the fields gb11 and tp8 , i.e. metal rich galactic bar star counts , in the region of the cmd we select for our analysis , strongly dominate",
    ".      there seems to be a small metallicity gradient throughout the galactic bulge ( minniti et al .",
    "1995 ; but see mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) , which could shift a little intrinsic color and luminosity of the red clump stars across the bulge .",
    "for all the models we took that into account by assuming @xmath105 where the choice of @xmath106 or @xmath107 depends on the density model fitted .",
    "we found that this additional parameter did not improve significantly the quality of the fits , we therefore did not present in table  2 the models with @xmath108 .",
    "the analytical models we used in this work were identical to those used by dwek et al . , so we should be able to compare our results directly ( with the remainder that the angle @xmath35 we use differs from dwek et al .",
    "@xmath36 by @xmath109 ) . for comparison we use dwek et al . best fitting models at @xmath110 with cutoff at @xmath111 , the same cutoff we use in this paper ( eq.[eq : integ ] ) . the dwek et al . fitting procedure ( their table  1 ) does not like power - law models ( our best fit models ) , so here we will only compare six other models we both used",
    ".    in fig.[fig9 ]",
    "we plot the values of @xmath112 from dwek et al .",
    "( @xmath71-axis ) and from this work ( @xmath113-axis ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to these values being equal .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the values of @xmath84 found by dwek et al . and those we find : they can be compared directly using dwek et al . table  1 and our table  2 .",
    "this is extremely reassuring because @xmath84 is not affected by `` rotating '' the bar , so the fact that we both get essentially the same values for @xmath84 means that , although here we are using data of entirely different nature from cobe - dirbe data , we probe in our analysis the same stellar populations .",
    "the correlations between @xmath114 values are not nearly as good as for @xmath84 , but still rather clear . on the other hand",
    ", there is no correlation between the inclination angles @xmath35 obtained by dwek et al . and our values .",
    "as we discussed earlier in this paper , regardless of the fitted model we obtain almost the same value for this angle , but dwek et al .",
    "obtained a wider range of values for this angle .",
    "we are confident that the nature of the data we use in this work allows for much better constraint of this parameter than the 2-d cobe - dirbe infrared intensity maps .    as we mentioned in section  5 , the g2 model which was dwek et al .",
    "best fit model fits our data worst .",
    "there is however several models which seem to fit both cobe - dirbe and our data reasonably well .",
    "in fact , for the g3 model the values of the bar parameters obtained by dwek et al .",
    "( their table  1 ) are remarkably similar to ours ( table  2 ) .",
    "the e2 model also fits reasonably well in both cases , and we suspect that if the value of @xmath35 for this model was fixed by dwek et al . to our value of @xmath115 , the agreement between @xmath116 would be much better . according to the trends we discussed in section  5 , lowering @xmath35 from dwek et al .",
    "@xmath117 to our @xmath118 would increase both @xmath61 and @xmath62 to values closer to ours .",
    "the e2 model might be preferred over the g3 model as it fits better the cobe - dirbe data in the inner region of the galaxy , where we do not have the cmd data from a low extinction fields .",
    "to summarize , for those who want to use a galactic bar model which should not be grossly wrong over large range of galactocentric distances , we recommend the e2 exponential model with _ our _ values for the bar parameters : @xmath119 . in fig.[fig10 ] we show the projected light from this model for the inner @xmath120 region of the galaxy , with our fields also shown .",
    "contours start at 10% of the central value and increase by 10% .",
    "the asymmetry between the positive and negative @xmath1 sides of the galactic bar is visible , but not striking .",
    "microlensing can provide us with additional information on the properties of the galactic bar .",
    "as noticed first by kiraga & paczyski ( 1994 ) , stars in the galactic bulge lensing other stars in the bulge produce significant contribution to the microlensing optical depth , comparable to that produced by the galactic disk stars lensing bulge stars .",
    "this effect is strongly enhanced when the galactic bulge is a bar with the major axis inclined to the line of sight by less the @xmath6 ( paczyski et al . 1994b ; zhao et al .",
    "recently zhao & mao ( 1996 ) investigated in detail how different models of the galactic bar would differ in the optical depth for microlensing they produce , so here we want to show only some of the aspects of the microlensing by the galactic bar .    in fig.[fig11 ]",
    "we show a map of the microlensing optical depth @xmath121 produced by our `` recommended '' e2 model in the inner @xmath120 region of the galaxy , with our fields also shown .",
    "the mass of the galactic bar was assumed to be @xmath122 .",
    "contours start at @xmath123 and increase also by @xmath123 to the maximum of @xmath124 .",
    "the contribution to the optical depth from the galactic disk was not included .",
    "details of this microlensing map would be different if we used one of other models discussed in this paper , but the overall effect of the optical depth dropping off rapidly with the distance from the galactic center , faster along the minor axis , would remain . as discussed by zhao & mao ( 1996 ) ,",
    "some few hundred microlensing events are needed before the microlensing can really make the difference for the existing galactic bar models .",
    "fortunately , this is very feasible judging from the existing microlensing experiments observing the galactic bar ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ; alcock et al .",
    "1995 ; alard et al .",
    "1995 ; alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "another aspect of the microlensing by the galactic bar was first noticed by stanek ( 1995 ) . as can be deduced from fig.[fig6 ] , the stars from the far side of the galactic bar will be preferentially lensed if most of the lensing comes from the bar stars ( paczyski et al .",
    "1994b ; zhao et al .",
    "this leads to the offset in the brightness of the lensed stars , as compared to all observed stars , discussed in detail by stanek ( 1995 ) .",
    "the value of this offset correlates very well with the depth of the galactic bar along the line of sight ( stanek 1995 , his fig.3 ) .",
    "about a hundred of microlensing events in the red clump region of the cmd are needed to measure this effect with desired accuracy .",
    "in this paper we have used color - magnitude data obtained by the ogle collaboration for 12 fields scattered across the galactic bulge ( fig.[fig3 ] ) to construct the three - dimensional model of the mass distribution in the galactic bar .",
    "we model the galactic bar by fitting for all fields the observed luminosity functions in the red clump region of the color - magnitude diagram ( fig.[fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we find that almost regardless of the analytical function used to describe the 3-d stars distribution of the galactic bar , the resulting models are inclined to the line of sight by @xmath2 ( fig.[fig7 ] ) , with axis ratios corresponding to @xmath3 ( fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "this puts a strong constraint on the possible range of the galactic bar models .    comparing our result with the results of dwek et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we find a good agreement between the derived parameters of the models ( fig.[fig9 ] ) , but we constrain the bar parameters much tighter .",
    "we recommend as a model which fits well both cobe - dirbe and our data the e2 model ( eq.9 ) with the values for the bar parameters : @xmath119 .",
    "we show various properties of this model in fig.reffig6 , [ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] .",
