    "the brick kiln was a major advance in ancient technology because it provided a stronger brick than the primitive sun - dried product .",
    "modern kilns or ovens are used in ceramics to fire clay and porcelain objects , in metallurgy for roasting iron cores , for burning lime and dolomite , and in making portland cement between other applications .",
    "this kind of ovens are an essential part of the manufacture of all ceramics , which , by definition , require heat treatment , often at high temperature . during this process ,",
    "chemical and physical reactions occur which cause the material to be permanently altered . in the case of pottery , clay materials are shaped , dried and then fired in a oven .",
    "although there is an experience of some several thousands years building ovens or furnaces and we can find some high technology apparatus , very detailed numerical analysis ( for example see @xcite ) , two phase flow study ( for instance @xcite ) or efficiency based analysis @xcite ; up to our knowledge there is no a simple model that allows us to calculate the physical properties and design an oven .        in figure [ fig1 ] we present a scheme of our conceptual oven composed by an insulated chamber with a thermal energy source in which the material to be burned can be introduced .",
    "the heat can be obtained by different energy sources those can be inside or outside the chamber , for the purpose of this paper the energy source is not important .",
    "the schematic oven is composed by a cooking chamber which is thermally insulated with a high thermal resistivity material ; inside this chamber the material to heat treated is placed .",
    "both material and chamber are heated simultaneously during oven operation with internal or external energy source .",
    "the aim of this paper is not only to describe the thermal behavior of a heating device , but to establish a methodology for ovens design considering the temperature evolution for different products and process .",
    "a typical temperature curve of cooking @xcite is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we can see that the process starts at @xmath0 with temperature @xmath1 . if the process consists in a constant heat flow @xmath2 as indicated in @xmath3 during a time @xmath4 , the internal temperature will follow a curve as @xmath5 up to reach @xmath6 then a maturity period follows , @xmath7 as shown in part @xmath8 .",
    "of course to follow this plot the heat flow needs to be diminished .",
    "paschkis and persson  @xcite proposed a slow change in heat flow as indicated in @xmath9 . in order to obtain simplest model we will set this heat flow as constant , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) as plotted in curve @xmath12 .",
    "after the cooking process the cooling part follows with @xmath13 , curve @xmath14 , then the temperature may be described by a curve like @xmath15 , at the end of cooking the thermal energy flow to the oven is canceled ( curve @xmath14 ) . with this",
    "the cooling of the oven and the products start ( curve @xmath15 ) , and the temperature ends in the temperature @xmath1 at time @xmath16 . in the same figure , it is shown that if the operation temperature @xmath6 was not specified ( in other words @xmath17 ) , and the energy is introduced @xmath2 to the oven as shown on the lines @xmath3 and @xmath18 , the thermal process starts following the temperature curve @xmath5 until time @xmath4 , and later , it will continue the curve @xmath19 .",
    "we can see that the curve @xmath19 has as asymptotic limit to the line of constant temperature @xmath20 , which is reached only when @xmath21 . of course , the graph of the figure  [ fig2 ] has been observed in many experimental works in the firing of miscellaneous products in ovens furnaces or kilns , when the average temperature is measured , and has obtained analytically data to interpolate ; however , there is not a well - founded theoretical model .",
    "we must emphasize the efforts to shape the curve of temperature with simple models . in 1961",
    ", trinks and mawhinney  @xcite , modeled the temperature curve of the load when the oven is preheated and the load is introduced at room temperature .",
    "then in 1994 , astirraga  @xcite presented a simple model for the thermal development of an electric oven , and he founded the differential equation that describes the process of warming , however , the initial conditions of the thermal process were not well established .",
    "therefore , the found solution does not correspond to the baking process , and this only describe qualitatively the process . in 2002 ,",
    "abraham and sparrow  @xcite , described the thermal behavior of a load at room temperature introduced on an electric preheated oven ; the analytic relation found has similarity with trinks and mawhinney s work  @xcite . in 2005 , tapia and del ro  @xcite characterized and model theoretically a  solar cooker  finding that the analytic representation of the temperature evolution inside the cooking chamber of the cooker depends on the thermal resistance of the oven , its heat capacity , and the characteristic parameters of the process .",
    "they also showed that cooking of food had a thermal development according to the predictions of theoretical models . in 2007",
    "schwarzer and vieira  @xcite developed a theoretical model , to evaluate the thermal development in a pot heated by solar energy , however , they apply the relation for two different cases , the first one for cooking in a pot exposed to the atmosphere , and that receives the solar flux concentrated by the reflect of a mirror , and the second one to a solar oven box .",
    "we should emphasize that , according to their approach , their theoretical model , can only describe the balance of energy in the pot exposed to the environment , and not to the pot inside the oven .",
    "the goals of this paper are : develop a methodology to design ovens based on a simple thermodynamic model that describes the temperature evolution according with the heating process indicated in figure .",
    "in this section we present a theoretical model for describing the temperature evolution inside of an oven in terms of some parameters that allow to us to design ovens or furnaces according to specific cooking requirements .",
    "we wish to describe the evolution of a representative temperature inside the cooking chamber of a oven . here",
    "it is important to mention that a detailed description of the temperature field may be important for some specific processes or for big cooking chambers where stratified temperature conditions could be found .",
    "however in this first approach , we can assume that we are selecting a good place to measure the temperature and it is representative of the whole temperature field , with this representative temperature we can construct an one temperature model for describing the cooking process as we have done above . in order to do the one temperature model we will use a global balance of energy using the cooking chamber as the control volume .",
    "due to the fact that , we try to reproduce the cooking curve , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , we will consider the next statements :    1 .",
    "we consider that all objects in the chamber are under thermal equilibrium condition .",
    "the materials that compose the oven and the cooking material have the constant physical properties , i.e. they do not depend on temperature .",
    "the heat capacity @xmath22 of insulators and supports of the oven are considered in the balance energy equation , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the specific heat and the mass of the component @xmath25 in the oven .",
    "the change of temperature @xmath26 with respect to @xmath27 has the following requirements : @xmath28 is maximum at @xmath0 , it is a non increasing function of @xmath27 and @xmath29 when @xmath21 .",
    "we neglect the energy of the chemical or phase transformations .",
    "we assume that no work enters or goes out from the furnace    1 .",
    "we consider that cavity and both air and body surfaces places in it are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the physical properties , as thermal conductivity and specific heat of oven components and cooking materials , are constant .",
    "3 .   the temperature change in the inner part of the oven satisfies the following restrictions : * @xmath30 .",
    "* @xmath31 is small in the heating process .",
    "* @xmath32 is maximum at @xmath0 , i.e. , it is a decreasing function on @xmath27 . *",
    "@xmath33 when @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the following approximations for the cooling part .",
    "* @xmath34 .",
    "* @xmath35 is small at @xmath36 .",
    "* @xmath37 is maximum at @xmath38 i.e. , it is a decreasing function on @xmath27 . *",
    "@xmath39 when @xmath21 .",
    "we are neglecting all the energy involved in chemical changes    following these ideas , the energy balance equation of the oven can be expressed as :  @xcite-@xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the input heat , @xmath42 is the heat diffused into the environment , @xmath43 is the accumulated energy of the furnace .",
    "here we can use that the accumulated energy can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the effective heat capacity of the oven . here",
    "we are considering the supports , insulator materials , meals , pastes and any other component as @xmath25 elements .    in this work",
    "we propose a simple model to follow a cooking procedures according with ia and ii curves in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this model will help us to design an effective furnace for product cooking with a constant energy flow input implemented by a control system that will have the characteristic of adjusting the energy flow input to a constant value @xmath46 .",
    "here it is important to mention that @xmath47 includes all energies we are supply to the furnaces , i.e. @xmath48 involves electrical power in case of electrical ovens , or heat coming from combustion in case of gas ovens , or solar power in case of solar furnaces or any combination of the former for hybrid energy devices .",
    "with this assumption we can write @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) to describe the temperature of the oven .    within this approximation , and according to statements 1 to 5",
    ", we will estimate the maximum value for @xmath42 by the relation that evaluates heat flow in steady state , which can be expressed mathematically as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the environment temperature , and @xmath52 is the total thermal resistance from the chamber to the environment .",
