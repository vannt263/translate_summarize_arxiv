    "the shapes of the surfaces between molecular clouds and the hii regions around massive stars typically feature elongated structures , commonly referred to as pillars , columns , spikes , or elephant trunks @xcite .",
    "the surface is a photoionization front driven by the strong uv radiation from the ob stars .",
    "one well - known example is the eagle nebula which has three large , molecular pillars near a small group of o stars @xcite .",
    "although a number of theoretical and numerical studies have been done , the formation mechanism is still not fully understood .",
    "the ob stars are hot , with photospheres at temperature of a few tens of thousands of kelvins @xcite , and give off high intensity uv photons .",
    "these uv photons irradiate the molecular cloud which surrounds the ob stars and photoevaporation occurs , resulting in a stratified structure .",
    "the photoevaporative flow ( ablated plasma ) velocity is normal to the molecular surface @xcite .",
    "the region between the ob stars and the molecular cloud surface is the hii region in which the hydrogen gas is almost fully ionized and the photoionization and recombination to neutral atomic hydrogen occurs in steady state .",
    "the if is a very thin layer because of the short mean free path for the incident photons on the cloud surface . at this cloud surface",
    "all the photons above the lyman limit are absorbed .",
    "the photons below the ionization limit but above 11.2 ev can not ionize the hydrogen atom in the ground state but can penetrate the if and dissociate the molecular hydrogen in the underlying layers .",
    "the thickness of the dissociation front differs with each cloud .",
    "the last layer in the stratified structure is the molecular gas . because of strong radiative cooling ,",
    "the molecular cloud temperature is typically a few tens of kelvin @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of such irradiated molecular clouds is thought to play a role in star formation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the outflow dynamics from the molecular cloud into the hii regions is of considerable , general interest @xcite .",
    "the pillars in m16 , popularly known as the eagle nebula , are at a distance of @xmath0 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is estimated that half of the ionizing radiation comes from a single o3 - 4 star and the rest mostly comes from the three other nearby stars ( o5 - 6 ) @xcite .",
    "the orientation of this system can be seen in fig .",
    "[ poundeagle ] ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the total ionizing flux is estimated to be @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature in the hii region near the molecular cloud surface is 9500  k and the ionized hydrogen number density is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) is relatively thin because the large hydrogen number density ( @xmath3 ) provides high optical depth . as measured by co line observations , the velocity gradients along the long axes of the pillars ( from `` head '' to `` tail '' ) are between -20.7 and + 6.7 @xmath4 , with an average magnitude of 8.3 @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the pillars are not in the same plane in the sky ; the differing signs of the velocity gradients indicate inclination towards ( positive gradient ) or away ( negative gradient ) from the observer .",
    "predictions of the classical rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability theory with regard to the velocity gradient @xcite are incompatible with the observed gradient , at least for constant acceleration @xcite .",
    "another formation mechanism should be considered .",
    "the formation mechanism of pillars beside massive stars has been discussed by a number of authors .",
    "there are two classes of models for their formation .",
    "one is that the pillars are formed due to dense , pre - existing cores in the molecular cloud ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a interesting variation on this idea",
    ", @xcite also simulated the result of a radiatively driven , pre - existing , short pillar with the same density as the background molecular cloud ( their case ii ) .",
    "even in this case , the pillar grows .",
    "another possibility is that the pillars are caused by hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "@xcite proposed a model based on the rt instability occurring at the contact discontinuity between the dense molecular cloud and the lower density , hot , photoevaporated plasma .",
    "he suggested that the pillars in the eagle nebula were the result from the nonlinear stage of the rt instability .",
    "@xcite estimated the time scale of the instability to be less than @xmath5 years .",
    "@xcite showed observations of several nebulae and estimated the age of the pillars by the rt model , assuming small initial amplitude of the perturbations .",
    "@xcite found another type of instability at the if in a non - accelerating frame , the so - called if instability , which , in his analysis , was present in the case of non - normal incident radiation . he derived a dispersion relation for perturbations growing by this process .",
    "@xcite extended it to include recombination , which plays a crucial role in the hii region .",
    "the recombination in the ionized gas works to smooth the surface when the wavelength of the perturbation is much larger than the recombination length .",
    "@xcite showed robust development of photoionized pillars with an isothermal model , although they considered a semi - infinite cloud and a non - accelerating if .",
    "@xcite derived a dispersion relation for the if with a non - normal incident radiation field including the effect of recombination in the ionized gas .",
    "@xcite found unstable modes with non - normal radiation for an accelerating if , but did not include recombination .",
    "most studies have assumed a semi - infinite molecular cloud and non - accelerating if .",
    "instabilities at an accelerating if were studied numerically by mizuta et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "they show that , for imposed perturbations with small initial amplitude , i.e. in the linear regime , there was no significant growth",
    ". large growth of a classical rt instability is observed when recombination in the hii region is not included .",
    "we study here in more depth the dynamics of an accelerating if .",
    "the existence of the acceleration at the if is quite different than most previous models .",

    "the same physics and computational method used in paper i are included in this study .",
    "the energy balance and magnetic pressure to prevent radiative collapse for the molecular cloud are considered .",

    "the equations ( [ e - massconserv])-([e - energyconserv ] ) are mass , momentum and energy conservation with energy sources .",
    "the energy source terms due to recombination in the ionized region , absorption of the uv radiation from ob stars , and cooling in the molecular gas are @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these energy sources are evaluated as @xmath12 , \\\\",

    "we ignore metal line cooling for simplicity , since its cooling power has the same dependence as that of recombination ( proportional to ionized hydrogen number density ) .",
    "the dissociation heating in the neutral region and other radiative processes are also ignored for simplicity .",
    "the heating function is @xmath18 erg which corresponds to the average energy deposited into the gas per absorbed ionizing photon , and leads to produce an isothermal temperature of @xmath19 k in the ionized gas as an equilibrium state of photoionization heating and recombination cooling .",
    "the case b recombination coefficients , which are summation of all recombination coefficients of hydrogen except the recombination to the ground state , are assumed constant @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( at @xmath19 k from @xcite ) , where @xmath22 includes the thermal velocity dependence of the rates of recombination and free - free collisional cooling .",
    "the equation of state ( eq . [ e - eos ] ) includes a magnetic pressure term for dense gas to prevent radiative collapse @xcite , where @xmath23 is the ionization fraction , @xmath24 is the ionized hydrogen volume density , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant values .",
    "the index @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is also constant .",
    "numerically , we do not take into account the atomic hydrogen state , assuming the dissociation front is thin as in the eagle nebula .",
    "equations ( [ e - fevolution ] ) and ( [ e - radtransport ] ) describe the evolution of @xmath29 and the transport of the incident radiation , where @xmath30 is the photoionization cross - section of hydrogen , and @xmath31 is the number flux of ionizing photons , i.e. , photons @xmath32 .",
    "since we use the `` on - the - spot approximation '' ( i.e. , photons emitted in recombination to ground state are immediately reabsorbed , whereas the photons emitted in recombination to second or higher levels are assumed to escape from the system ) , we do not consider the diffusive photon emission and transport .",
    "the 2d computational domain is ( @xmath33 ) = ( 0.46 pc@xmath343 pc ) .",
    "uniform grid points ( @xmath35 pc ) are used .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are employed ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 pc ) .",
    "the other boundary conditions are open boundary which means zero gradient . an incident photon flux ( @xmath38 )",
    "is imposed from one boundary ( @xmath39 pc ) , where @xmath40 is the unit vector of the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the rays are parallel to the @xmath41 axis .",
    "a cloud of initial thickness of a quarter pc , and density of @xmath42 is set 0.5 pc away from the boundary where the incident photons come in .",
    "a very dilute gas @xmath43 is imposed in the other regions .",
    "initially , the gas at @xmath44 pc is in pressure equilibrium , and the gas at @xmath45 pc is isothermal ( 40 k ) .",
    "the constant parameters in the equation of state , such as , @xmath26 and @xmath25 , are the mass density and thermal pressure , of the initial molecular cloud , respectively .",
    "we impose the perturbation in the cloud in three different ways .",

    "we assume a wavelength of @xmath49 pc , and consider amplitudes @xmath50 ( model d2 ) , 0.3 ( d3 ) , 0.4 ( d4 ) and 0.5 ( d5 ) . the second method is a 30% amplitude perturbation in the incident photon number flux of form @xmath51)$ ] , starting at 98 , 102 , 106 , or 108 kyr and ending at 110 kyr .",
    "these are models p098 , p102 , p106 , p108 , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the method used in paper i and in mizuta et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "the third method is to impose surface perturbations on the initial cloud , according to @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the amplitude ( @xmath53 ) is @xmath54 pc ( model s038 ) , @xmath55 pc ( s090 ) , @xmath56 pc ( s140 ) , and @xmath57 pc ( s190 ) .",
    "we briefly show the results without any perturbations , before showing the results with perturbations .",
    "the dynamics without any perturbation is very simple . when the incident photon flux is turned on",
    ", a shock propagates through the molecular cloud ( compression phase ) . after this",
    "shock breaks out of the back side of the cloud , a rarefaction passes back through the shocked cloud",
    ". then an acceleration phase begins at about @xmath58 kyr , as the cloud moves as a unit .",
    "figure [ 1d_1 ] shows one dimensional profiles of the hydrogen number density at the early phase of the dynamics at @xmath59 and 150 kyr . in the figure ,",
    "all three phases are shown , although the phase at around @xmath58 kyr to @xmath60 kyr in which the rarefaction passes back through the compressed cloud is too short to show .",
    "the hydrogen number density profiles of an initially semi - infinite cloud are shown in fig .",
    "[ 1d_2 ] , both with and without magnetic pressure .",
    "the initial total pressure without the magnetic component is lower than with it . without magnetic pressure ,",
    "the number density of the compressed cloud becomes about 1.5 times higher , since there is less pressure support .",
    "figure [ amp ] shows the evolution of the amplitude , i.e. , half the peak - to - valley of the perturbation of the @xmath61 contour in the @xmath41 direction for each case , for all three methods of imposing the perturbation . it should be noted that this does not always correspond to the amplitude of the perturbation on the cloud surface because of the effect of `` separation of the if '' discussed below . in cases with small initial perturbations ( models d2 , d3 , p106 , p108 , and s038 ) ,",
    "the perturbation does not grow but rather oscillates as observed in paper i. this stabilization is caused by the density profile in the hii region .",
    "the ablated ( photoevaporated ) gas in the concave region of the incipient bubble concentrates ( gets weakly `` focused '' ) in the region above the bubble vertex .",
    "this concentration of gas subsequently absorbs more of the incoming ionizing photons , reducing the photon flux reaching the if region at the cloud surface near the bubble vertex , compared with the spike region .",
    "this is because the recombination rate depends on the square of the ionized hydrogen number density in the hii region .",
    "the net result is that the ablation pressure locally decreases in the bubble region compared to the spike region , which acts to smooth out the perturbed surface , if the perturbation is small .",
    "this is also shown in fig.[density]a with a 2d plot of number density late in time ( @xmath62 kyr ) for a small initial density perturbation ( model d2 ) .",
    "the if is quite smooth , namely , no growth of the perturbation has occurred .",
    "the other cases ( d3 , p106 , p108 , and s038 ) in which the perturbation does not grow behave similarly .      when the perturbation initial amplitude is larger , roughly when the ratio of the initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02 , the perturbations grow , after the acceleration phase begins at around @xmath58 kyr ( models d4 , d5 , p098 , p102 , s090 , s140 , and s190 ) .",
    "recombination in the hii region is included in all cases . here , we concentrate on the case with an imposed density perturbation ( model d5 ) to illustrate why the perturbation grows when the amplitude of the imposed perturbation exceeds a critical value",
    ".    figures [ density ] ( b)-(i ) show a series of the 2d hydrogen number density plots ( color ) with incident photon flux contours ( solid curves ) at different times .",
    "the high density regions correspond to molecular gas compressed by the ablation pressure . a typical hydrogen number density in the hii region near the if is @xmath63 as shown in figure [ 1d_1 ] .",
    "the solid white lines correspond to incident photon number contours from 0 to @xmath64 at intervals of @xmath65 , starting from the ionization front where the ionization fraction ( @xmath29 ) goes to zero .",
    "since we do not show the whole computational domain , all the photon flux contours are not shown in the figures in the later phases .    in fig.[density ]",
    "( b ) , the photon flux contours near to the if are of the opposite phase as the if because of the oscillation of the if .",
    "this oscillation occurs by the stabilization mechanism seen in the linear regime ( paper i ) . in fig.[density ] ( c ) , the @xmath66 photon flux contour separates slightly from the highly compressed molecular cloud around @xmath67 pc , @xmath68 pc ( see also the close - up view in figure [ zoom ] ) .",
    "this is the separation of the if from the cloud surface .",
    "it happens because all the incident photons moving toward this region are absorbed by the recombined neutral hydrogen accumulated near the bubble vertex at @xmath67 pc .",
    "this could be understood as an extreme case of the normal stabilization mechanism of the if instability , because the increasing density around the cavity causes strong absorption of the incident photons . during the separation of the",
    "if , the cloud surface is shadowed .",
    "this shadowed region does not feel any ablation pressure because no absorption of the incident photons occur there , whereas the other parts of the cloud surface which are directly ablated by the incident photons feels strong ablation pressure .",
    "the region between the shadowed cloud surface and the separated if becomes neutral .",
    "the appearance of the neutral region happens because the timescale for recombination is roughly @xmath69 @xmath70 yr for ionized hydrogen at a number density of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , once the cloud surface is shadowed , the neutral region quickly appears close to the shadowed surface .",
    "we can identify this region as a warm hi region ( @xmath72 k ) because it has lost half of its thermal energy by recombination cooling .",
    "the pressure in this warm hi region is a few times smaller than that of the hii region and the molecular gas .",
    "this region has similar physical properties as the warm hi layer in front of pdrs described by @xcite ( see their figure 3 ) , which also arises due to a lowering of the ionization fraction .",
    "the appearance of this separation strongly affects the dynamics of the if . in reaction",
    ", the compressed cloud expands into the low pressure region , namely , in the @xmath41 direction , which triggers the second harmonic of the imposed initial perturbation in subsequent frames ( fig.[density](d ) - ( e ) ) .",
    "although the second harmonic of the imposed initial perturbation of the cloud surface can be clearly seen at @xmath73 kyr , the second photon contour ( @xmath74 ) from the if still shows just a single mode . in other words , the density around the side ( @xmath75 pc ) is high , and the density around the center ( @xmath67 ) is low , although both regions on the cloud surface are spikes .",
    "thus the stabilization mechanism seen in the linear regime ( paper i , and section  [ small ] ) does not work in this case .",
    "the ablation pressure is strong around the center ( @xmath67 pc ) , because the two last contours are close to each other there ( meaning the photon flux incident on the cloud surface is relatively high ) . as a result ,",
    "a large amount of thermal energy is deposited there and compression by the strong ablation pressure occurs .",
    "by contrast , around the side ( @xmath75 pc ) the last two incident photon contours are separated from each other ( meaning a lower photon flux reaches the ablation front at the cloud surface ) .",
    "the resulting lower ablation pressure causes slight local expansion in the @xmath41 direction ( fig.[density ] ( e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "this expansion allows the growth of the spike at the sides ( fig.[density ] ( g ) ) , and a strong second harmonic has grown up .    by 320 kyr , separation of the if from the ablation front ( cloud surface ) near the lateral boundaries has occurred ( fig.[density](h ) ) , and by 400 kyr ( fig.[density](i ) ) , this separation has also appeared near the middle .",
    "the net result is that the perturbation amplitudes at the center and lateral edges grow .",
    "once a critical amplitude is exceeded , at around 400 kyr , the stabilization mechanism is weakened by the steepness of the perturbations ( i.e. , the photon flux and therefore ablation rate along the steep sides of the perturbations drops , so there is much less density rise in the hii gas in the concave region ) , and the rt evolution proceeds rapidly into the deep nonlinear regime ( fig.[density](j ) ) .    for the other cases with a large amplitude of initial perturbations ( d4 , p098 , p102 , s090 , s140 , and s190 ) , we observe similar dynamics of the if and cloud surface",
    "the separation of the if occurs , a second harmonic of the imposed perturbation is triggered , and finally two pillars grow .",
    "the center panels of fig . [ resolution ] show a large perturbation growth in later phase of the dynamics using the different methods of the imposing the initial perturbation : density modulation ( model d5 ; top ) , perturbation in photon number flux ( model p102 ; middle ) , and surface perturbation ( model s090 ; bottom ) .",
    "the growth of the second harmonic mode of the perturbation is observed in all cases .",
    "figure [ velocity ] shows the @xmath41-component of the velocity in the pillar for an initial perturbation in density ( model d5 ) , in photon flux contour ( p102 ) , and in the surface ( s090 ) .",
    "the @xmath76 gradients are @xmath77 8.0 ( d5 ) , 16 ( p102 ) , and 12 ( s090 ) @xmath78 . in a real pillar",
    ", an observer would see any velocity gradient corresponding to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the inclination angle of the pillar with the plane of the sky .",
    "indeed , @xcite measured such gradients in the pillars of the eagle nebula .",
    "this observed velocities in pillar ii of the eagle nebula are also plotted for comparison .",
    "for the purposes of the figure , we have taken @xmath81 degrees , dividing the observed values by @xmath82 .",
    "thus , for small inclination angles , our numerical results are good agreement with the observed pillar ii velocity gradient of @xmath83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation without the recombination effect , which was shown in paper i , shows a large growth of the imposed perturbation .",
    "the surface also shows growth of a shorter wavelength perturbation due to purely numerical reasons , such as less dissipation .",
    "it is impossible to impose exactly one single mode using cartesian coordinates ; small amplitude and short wavelength perturbations will also always be imposed .",
    "the wavelength of the short - wavelength `` noise '' which grows depends on the resolution of the calculation . to eliminate the possibility of this effect in the current calculations",
    ", we also performed the calculations with higher and lower resolution in the @xmath84 direction ; specifically , twice ( 384 ) and a half ( 96 ) the number grid points than in our standard calculation .",
    "figure [ resolution ] shows the results of higher ( right panels ) and lower ( left panels ) resolution calculations . as a reference ,",
    "the results of the standard resolution calculation are also shown ( center ) .",
    "the results of the three different ways for imposing perturbations are shown ( top : @xmath62 kyr , 50% peturbation in density ; middle : @xmath85 kyr , 30% peturbation in photon number flux during 102 - 110 kyr ; bottom : @xmath62 kyr , surface perturbation of amplitude @xmath86 pc ) .",
    "the pillars appear and grow at all resolutions , differing only in fine - scale structure at the cloud surfaces .",
    "the separation of the ionization front is also observed at the early phase of the dynamics in each case .",
    "thus , we conclude that the pillar appearance is not a resolution - dependent effect .      that we produce pillars",
    "is purely the result of our periodic boundary conditions . unlike the pillars in our simulation , the eagle pillars are not co - planar and",
    "do not share the same inclination angle ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are effectively three isolated pillars , rather than a single structure .",
    "pillars in other hii regions are also typically isolated .",
    "however , our main aim in this paper has been to describe the instability of accelerating if , so we have assumed initially a single wavelength and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have chosen only one set of free parameters  the wavelength and number density , initial magnetic pressure of the initial cloud , incident photon number flux at the boundary , and thickness of the cloud  although these specific values match those of eagle nebula reasonably well .",
    "the main key to this instability is the mismatch of perturbation modes between the if and density in the hii region .",
    "the separation of the if from the cloud is the trigger for this mismatch .",
    "thus , it should still be possible to create an isolated pillar in the hii region under conditions where a single wavelength grows and becomes a pillar .",
    "different wavelengths and multiwavelength cases should be investigated , however , since the phenomenon relies on nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the effect of varying the magnetic field pressure should also be investigated , although the magnetic pressure is introduced just to prevent too high a number density from forming and does not affect the physical mechanism of the growth of the perturbation .",
    "an mhd calculation is one avenue for improvement over the current models .    in this study",
    "we have adopted the on - the - spot approximation which ignores the recombination of the ionized hydrogen to the ground state , assuming that the photon emitted by this recombination is absorbed locally because its energy is high enough to ionize another hydrogen atom . however , this approximation is not sufficient for cartesian calculations when the directions of if propagation and of the incident light rays become close to parallel .",
    "in such cases , irradiation by diffuse photons is the main source of ionization of the sides of the pillars .",
    "we expect to include this diffused photon transport in future calculations .",
    "we have investigated hydrodynamic instability of the accelerating if including detailed energy accounting .",
    "three different ways of imposing the initial perturbation were adopted : ( 1 ) perturbation in density : ( 2 ) perturbation in photon number flux : and ( 3 ) surface perturbation .",
    "we observe no large growth when the incident perturbation is small .",
    "this stabilization is the same as that observed in paper i , and identical to the stabilization mechanism theoretically found by @xcite for the non - accelerating if .",
    "the strong absorption of incident photons causes decreasing ablation pressure around the cavity , which effectively smooths out small amplitude perturbations .",
    "in contrast , large growth of the second harmonic of the imposed perturbation is observed when the initial perturbation is large , namely , the ratio of the initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02 . a slight separation of the if from the cloud surface triggers the appearance of a warm hi region and the appearance of a second harmonic of the imposed perturbation .",
    "the separation of the if from the cloud surface happens when all the incident photons traveling toward this region are absorbed by the recombined neutral hydrogen accumulated near the bubble vertex .",
    "the gas at this cloud surface at location begins to expand in the @xmath41 direction during the separation because the pressure in the warm hi region is less than that in other regions .",
    "although the second harmonic is imprinted on the cloud surface , the density perturbation and incident photon flux contours in the hii region are still single mode .",
    "the mismatch between modes at the cloud surface and in the density in the hii region above the cloud surface prevents stabilization and cause nonlinear dynamics of the molecular cloud . in the later phase of the dynamics , large growth of the perturbation",
    "is observed .",
    "this new result for the if instability does not depend on the method by which the initial perturbation is imposed .",
    "we also show that it is independent of the resolution of the calculation .",
    "the velocity gradient in the model pillar in the later phase of the dynamics is in good agreement with that observed in the eagle nebula .",
