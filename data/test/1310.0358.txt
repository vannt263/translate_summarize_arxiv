    "the 7 tev and 8 tev run at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have revealed and confirmed the existence of a higgs - like particle @xmath0 in the standard model ( sm ) with mass in the narrow range of 125 - 126 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this discovery is also verified by the recent tevatron final results @xcite .",
    "the observation of this new particle combines evidence in the decays @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "different signal strengths , defined as the product of higgs boson production cross sections from different channels and the branching ratios for different decay modes normalized to the corresponding products in sm , have been measured with good precision by both experiments at atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "these measurements will be further improved in the future 13 - 14 tev run at the lhc , and perhaps at a future international linear collider ( ilc ) should this machine ever be built . from these signal strengths measurement",
    "one can extract information on the couplings of this higgs - like particle to the gauge bosons and sm fermions . from the most recent measurements ,",
    "extraction of this higgs - like particle couplings to sm particles seem to be consistent to a great extent with those of the sm higgs boson couplings @xcite .",
    "moreover , data collected both at atlas and cms indicate that this higgs - like particle has zero spin and is cp - even , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 is preferred @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the higgs - like particle at the lhc indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar exists in nature .",
    "certainly , many phenomenological models that extend the sm scalar sector with just one scalar doublet existed already in the literature . some of them are motivated by physics of the dark matter ( dm ) or neutrinos masses . among these extensions",
    ", we have models with multiple higgs doublets , with one higgs doublet and multiple singlets or triplets etc .",
    "all these extensions should have one light scalar with higgs - like couplings to sm particles in the range tolerated by signal strength measurements .",
    "indeed many studies ( see for example the references in @xcite ) have been done using these data to constrain various extensions of the scalar sector of the sm .    in this paper , we concentrate on the inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm ) which is a very simple extension of the sm .",
    "it was first proposed by deshpande and ma @xcite in order to study the pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the ihdm is an attractive model due to its simplicity .",
    "it is basically a two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) with an imposed exact @xmath6 symmetry . under the @xmath6 symmetry , all the sm particles are even representing the visible sector , while the new higgs doublet field is odd representing the inert dark sector . imposing the @xmath6 symmetry",
    "forbids the second higgs doublet developing a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and all the inert particles in this doublet can only appear in pair in their interaction vertices .",
    "indeed , recent studies @xcite of global fits of the lhc data suggest that the couplings between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge bosons with the new 125 - 126 gev higgs - like boson are very close to their sm values",
    ". the new 125 - 126 gev boson may play the entire role of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and leave no room for other higgs fields to develop any vevs .",
    "this favors the ihdm . as a result",
    ", ihdm exhibits very interesting phenomenology .",
    "it predicts the existence of a neutral scalar field , denoted generically by @xmath9 here , which is the lightest odd particle ( lop ) in this model and will play the role of dm candidate .",
    "the higgs mechanism provides a portal for communication between the inert dark sector and the visible sm sector .",
    "thus if kinematics allowed , the sm higgs boson may decay into a pair of dm @xmath9 and will contribute to the invisible sm higgs boson width which is now constrained by the lhc data .",
    "moreover , annihilation of @xmath9 into sm particles will provide thermal relic density and the scattering of @xmath9 onto nucleons will lead to direct detection signatures . therefore , ihdm could be considered as a simple but competitive model in the market with a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . as we will see later , ihdm could predict correct dm relic density as well as a cross section for scattering of @xmath9 onto nucleons that is consistent with existing data from direct detection .",
    "almost three decades later , ihdm was extended further by ma @xcite to include three @xmath6 odd weak singlets of right - handed neutrinos with majorana masses . in this extended model @xcite , a radiative seesaw mechanism for light neutrino masses",
    "was proposed and either @xmath9 or one of the right - handed neutrinos could be dm candidate .",
    "we will not consider this extended version of ihdm in this work but would like to return to this in the future @xcite .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "there have been many attempts to introduce dm higgs models by extending the sm scalar sector with more singlets or doublets @xcite . in particular , the phenomenology of ihdm had been extensively discussed in the context of dm phenomenology @xcite and also for collider phenomenology @xcite .",
    "ihdm has been also advocated to explain the naturalness problem @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we will reconsider the ihdm model in light of the recent atlas and cms discovery of a higgs - like particle of 125 - 126 gev .",
    "we assume that the lop must fulfill the recent relic density measurement by planck @xcite . as a good dm candidate test",
    ", we also consider the constraints from dm direct and indirect detection .",
    "for the constraint from dm direct detection search , we study the impact from the most recent lux upper limit @xcite which provides a robust constraint on the parameter space . as for indirect detection",
    ", we will take into account the fermi - lat @xmath10-ray observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) @xcite and the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath10-rays , we also include constraints from cosmic ray electrons / positrons from ams-02 @xcite , pamela @xcite , and fermi - lat @xcite , and cosmic ray anti - protons from pamela @xcite .",
    "these constraints will be also supplemented by the lhc constraints such as monojet and diphoton signal strength measurement as well as constraint on the higgs boson invisible decay width .",

    "these include : electroweak precision test constraints , @xmath7 and @xmath8 width constraints , negative search for charginos and neutralinos from lep - ii that could restrict the inert higgs bosons masses , diphoton signal strength measurement as well as monojet constraint from dm search at lhc . in section 4",
    ", we will discuss the relic density measurement by planck as well as dm direct detection and indirect detection constraints . in section 5",

    "future experimental constraints from lhc-14 , xenon1 t and ams-02 are discussed in section 7 .",
    "we conclude in section 8 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the salient features of ihdm and discuss some existing theoretical constraints .",
    "the ihdm @xcite is a rather simple extension of the sm higgs sector .",
    "it contains the sm higgs doublet @xmath14 and an additional higgs doublet @xmath15 .",
    "this model has a @xmath6 symmetry under which all the sm fields including @xmath14 are even while @xmath15 is odd under @xmath6 : @xmath16 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath6 symmetry is not spontaneously broken _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 field does not develop vev .",
    "these doublets can be parameterized as : h_1 = (    c g^+ + ( v + h +",
    "i g^0 )    )  ,   h_2 = (    c h^+ + ( s + i a )    ) where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the charged and neutral goldstone bosons respectively , which will be absorbed by the @xmath19 and @xmath8 to acquire their masses .",
    "the scalar potential with an exact @xmath6 symmetry forbids the mass term @xmath20 which mixes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus it has one fewer term than in thdm , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 the electroweak gauge symmetry is broken when @xmath14 doublet gets its vev : @xmath22 while @xmath23 .",
    "this pattern of symmetry breaking ensures unbroken @xmath6 symmetry and results in one more cp - even neutral scalar @xmath24 , one cp - odd neutral scalar @xmath25 , a pair of charged scalars @xmath26 and @xmath27 in addition to the sm",
    "cp - even scalar higgs @xmath0 . note that since @xmath0 is the sm higgs boson , it is @xmath6 even , while @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath28 are @xmath6 odd .",
    "moreover , the exact @xmath6 symmetry naturally imposes the flavor conservation .",
    "only sm higgs boson couples to sm fermions while the inert higgses @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath28 do not .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry also ensures the stability of the lightest scalar ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) that can act as a dm candidate .",

    "therefore the final states of the two production processes @xmath73 and @xmath74 would be multi - leptons or multi - jets , depending on the decay products of @xmath19 and @xmath8 , plus missing energies . to certain extents , the signatures for the charged higgs case would be similar to the supersymmetry searches for charginos and neutralinos at @xmath75 or at hadron colliders @xcite . and @xmath76 in the ihdm case @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for fermionic and scalar pair production are scaled by @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , where @xmath79 is the velocity of the final state particle in the center - of - mass frame .",

    "since either @xmath42 or @xmath25 is the lightest @xmath6 odd particle , it will be stable and the decay @xmath93 will be invisible .",
    "both atlas and cms had performed searches for invisible decay of the higgs boson @xcite . using the higgs - strahlung sm cross section for @xmath94 with a 125 gev sm higgs boson , atlas @xcite has excluded an invisible branching ratio of the higgs boson larger than 65% with 95% c.l .. cms also studied the invisible decay of the higgs boson produced via the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) mechanism and obtained an upper limit for the invisible branching ratio of 69% with 95% c.l ..",
    "when the two production mechanisms are combined the upper limit becomes 54% with 95% c.l .",
    "this constraint on the invisible decay is rather weak compared to the one derived from various works of global fits to atlas and cms data @xcite .",
    "these global fits studies suggest that the branching ratio of the invisible decay of the higgs boson should not exceed 19% at 95% c.l . in the case where the higgs boson has sm - like couplings to all sm particles plus additional invisible decay mode which is exactly the case as in ihdm . on the other hand , if one allows for deviation in the @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 as well on general grounds but not for ihdm ) coupling from its sm value the 95% c.l .",
    "limit on the invisible higgs decay branching ratio moves up to 29% @xcite .",
    "* assuming that the production cross section of the higgs boson is dominated by the gluon gluon fusion process , the diphoton signal strength in the ihdm normalized to the sm value can be simplified as @xmath97 where in the first line we have used the narrow width approximation and in the second line we used the fact that @xmath98 is the same in both the sm and ihdm .",
    "thus the signal strength @xmath99 in ihdm is simply given by the ratio of the branching ratios , which is not necessarily one since the charged higgs boson in ihdm can provide extra contribution other than the sm particles to the triangle loop amplitude of @xmath100 .",
    "+ at atlas , the overall signal strength for diphoton is about @xmath101 , which corresponds to about 2@xmath102 deviation from the sm prediction @xcite , while the other channels are consistent with sm .",
    "however , at cms , the new analysis for diphoton mode based on multivariate analysis @xcite gives a signal strength about @xmath103 , which is consistent with sm .",
    "many proposals based on physics beyond sm , including ihdm , have been suggested to explain the diphoton excess , but the actual disagreement between atlas and cms does not allow to draw any definite conclusions yet , given the current level of statistics . in the present analysis we will not try to explain the diphoton excess but rather study the impact of the other constraints on the ratio @xmath99 . * besides using the invisible width of the higgs decay , another strategy to look for dm at the lhc is to study high @xmath104 monojet balanced by a large missing transverse energy @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "such kind of signature is possible in ihdm by producing the sm higgs boson @xmath0 in association with an energetic jet followed by the invisible decay of @xmath0 . in our analysis",
    "we will consider the following parton processes : * * @xmath106 : @xmath107-channel and @xmath108-channel tree level diagrams with the higgs boson radiated from @xmath109 quark legs , * * @xmath110 : @xmath108-channel diagram through tree level gluon - quark - anti - quark vertex and one - loop @xmath96 effective vertex , * * @xmath111 : @xmath108-channel diagram through tree level three gluon vertex and one - loop @xmath96 effective vertex , * * @xmath112 : @xmath107-channel diagram through tree level gluon - quark - anti - quark vertex and one - loop @xmath96 effective vertex .",

    "<S> in light of the recent discovery by the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a higgs - like particle with a narrow mass range of 125 - 126 gev , we perform an updated analysis on one of the popular scalar dark matter models , the inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account in our likelihood analysis of various experimental constraints , including recent relic density measurement , dark matter direct and indirect detection constraints as well as the latest collider constraints on the invisible decay width of the higgs boson and monojet search at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that if the invisible decay of the standard model higgs boson is open , lhc as well as direct detection experiments like lux and xenon100 could put stringent limits on the higgs boson couplings to dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the most favoured parameter space for ihdm corresponds to dark matter with a mass less than 100 gev or so . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the best - fit points are at the dark matter mass around 70 gev where the invisible higgs decay to dark matter is closed . </S>",
    "<S> scalar dark matter in the higher mass range of 0.5 - 4 tev is also explored in our study . projected sensitivities for the future experiments of monojet at lhc-14 , xenon1 t and ams-02 one year antiproton flux </S>",
    "<S> are shown to put further constraints on the existing parameter space of ihdm . </S>"
