    "the recent bicep2 experiment reports an over @xmath6 detection of gravitational waves @xcite , with tensor to scalar ratio @xmath7 this corresponds to a gravitational wave fluctuation amplitude @xmath8    despite of the great success of inflation , there are still a few outstanding challenges for theorists and experimentalists .    on the theoretical side , large field inflation is now favored .",
    "however , large field inflation is hard to construct from the effective field theory , and stringy uv completion points of view .",
    "the uv completion of inflation has long suffered from an @xmath9-problem @xcite , in which the mass of the inflaton is theoretically too large to allow enough e - folds of inflation .",

    "slow roll inflation , at every e - fold , the inflaton rolls a distance of order @xmath11 . in perturbative string theory , this field motion per e - fold is comparable with , or greater than the string scale @xmath12 . as a result , one can no longer safely globally expand the inflaton field and ignore non - renormalizable terms .",
    "more discussions and a local reconstruction of the inflationary potential can be found in @xcite    on the observational side , there is yet another ( and maybe the last in the foreseeable future , unless nature is so kind as to imprint other relics on the cmb sky or in the large scale structure ) test for inflation which is possible in light of bicep2 , but not yet achieved ",

    "[ fig : rnt_contour ] , @xmath14 and @xmath13 are strongly correlated when the pivot scale is chosen at @xmath22 .",
    "this makes detailed analysis inconvenient .",
    "the strong correlation comes from the fact that the bicep2 experiment is actually not observing the b - mode signals at their pivot scale @xmath22 , but instead the observation is made at about @xmath29 .",
    "this does not matter for the bicep2 data analysis itself because @xmath21 is chosen in their data analysis .",

    "both of @xmath39 are close to @xmath40 meaning both of them are good fit , but the one with the parameter @xmath13 is slightly better .",
    "the improvement mainly comes from the small scale excess of the b - mode power spectrum .",

    "however , the significance of blue @xmath13 increase dramatically once planck data is considered . after allowing to vary @xmath13 , @xmath30 is improved by @xmath42 for this single parameter .",

    ", one can calculate that @xmath48 , showing strong evidence of blue @xmath13 .",
    "it is straightforward to understand why inclusion of planck data strongly prefers blue @xmath13 .",
    "note that among the likelihoods listed in table  [ tab : chi2 ] , the most significant improvement comes from the @xmath43 part of planck temperature data .",
    "this is because , there is already an anomalous temperature power deficit in the small @xmath31 part of the planck data , by an amount of @xmath49 , at the statistical significance of @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand , the existence of tensor mode , when assuming @xmath21 , adds to the theoretically predicted temperature power by another @xmath49 , which fits data even worse .    by inclusion of @xmath13 , the above tension between planck and bicep is reconciled .",
    "as one can compare to the last column of table  [ tab : chi2 ] , after adding blue @xmath13 , the likelihood of planck low @xmath31 , planck high @xmath31 and wmap polarization are all comparable with the best fit values before bicep2 .",

    "thus @xmath145 thus the tensor power spectrum @xmath146 from the observed tensor to scalar ratio @xmath147 we get @xmath148 from cobe normalization , we get @xmath149 below those scales , no classical source could generate primordial tensor modes .    in some simple models proposed in @xcite ,",
    "the produced particles have a time - dependent mass .",
    "@xmath150 due to its coupling to the rolling of inflaton . compared with the fact that inflation has the decreasing hubble constant , which predict a red tensor spectrum",
    ", the increasing mass will afford an explanation of the blue tensor spectrum .",
    "it is also important to note that non - gaussianities are also produced from the particle production process @xcite .",
    "the constraints from non - gaussianity of particle production remains to be tested .",
    "based on the slow roll expansion @xcite , it is recently pointed out that violation of slow roll can generate blue tensor spectrum @xcite . in @xcite , the tensor spectral index",
    "is calculated up to second order in slow roll as @xmath151 thus if the slow roll expansion is extrapolated to @xmath152 , blue tensor spectrum is obtained .",
    "for example , the possible blue tensor spectrum in the ultra - slow - roll inflation @xcite is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to further examine this possibility without slow roll restrictions , and see if the introduced large running is consistent with data .",
    "the tensor modes come from the gravity sector .",
    "thus there is no surprise that if gravity is modified , the tensor spectrum could change .    among other possibilities ,",
    "massive gravity is one example to achieve this goal",
    ". massive gravity on a time dependent background is a challenge @xcite . nevertheless , there exist viable models @xcite and application to inflation @xcite .",
    "we may expect tensor modes with blue spectra in massive gravity : if @xmath153 for the graviton during inflation , the tensor modes which exit the horizon earlier have more time to roll back to the origin of their mass potential , and thus are suppressed more . as a result",
    ", a blue tensor tilt can be generated .",
    "however , the massive gravity in the late universe does not help for the tensor modes .",
    "this is because the mass of the graviton is too small .",
    "also , the return - to - horizon effect actually generates a redder spectrum for the gravitational waves @xcite .      as another interesting class of possibilities ,",
    "some inflation models come with space - like condensates of fields .",
    "for example , space - like gradient of scalars in solid inflation @xcite and so(3 ) massive gravity @xcite , or space - like vector fields in chromo - natural inflation @xcite .",
    "typically , so(3 ) spatial rotational symmetry is imposed to keep isotropy . in this class of models",
    ", there can be additional tensor components from decomposition of the so(3 ) group , other than the graviton .",
    "those components can also contribute to the b - mode power spectrum .",
    "for the additional components , there is no nec type restriction against blue spectra .",
    "for example , solid inflation predicts a slightly blue tensor spectrum @xcite .",
    "note that the blue tilt in solid inflation is on the one hand suppressed by @xmath10 but on the other hand boosted by sound speed . for @xmath68",
    "one finds @xmath154 .      with the assumption of isotropy",
    ", scalar modes can not source the tensor modes at the linear level .",
    "however , beyond the linear level , tensor modes can be sourced by scalar modes @xcite .",
    "those second order effects are typically unobservably small because they are suppressed by the inflationary power spectrum .",
    "however , the second order contribution to tensor mode can be boosted by a small sound speed of an isocurvature scalar sector @xcite .",
    "the generated gravitational waves are highly non - gaussian .",
    "the tilt of tensor spectrum coming from those contributions are not constrained by the null energy condition , thus a blue tilt is possible .      as",
    "another alternative to inflation scenario , in matter bounce , the universe was in a contracting phase before bouncing back and heating up ( see @xcite for a review ) . in matter",
    "bounce , the tensor modes are nearly scale invariant but the amplitudes have been too high .",
    "recently , a two - field bounce model is introduced and the tensor modes can be tuned as a parameter @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to see if this model ( among other possibilities ) fit the current observations and has a potential for blue tensor spectrum .",
    "to conclude , we fit the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the tensor spectral tilt with data .",
    "the current data is not good enough to test the inflationary consistency relation but nevertheless blue tensor spectra are favored when all 9 bins of bicep2 data , in combination with the polarbear data , are used .    from theoretical aspects ,",
    "string gas cosmology predicts blue tensor spectra .",
    "however , the tilt is small , at the same order - of - magnitude of scalar tilt .",
    "thus the future experiments targeting to test the inflationary consistency relation can also test this prediction of string gas cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "string gas cosmology predicts highly gaussian density and tensor perturbations .",
    "this is unlike the other inflationary mechanisms , where a blue tilt also implies non - gaussianities .",
    "the simplest model of g - inflation , on the other hand , tilts scalar and tensor power spectra in the same way .",
    "thus with a red scalar spectral tilt , the tensor spectra are also red . in the parameter regime where both scale and tensor spectra are blue , the blueness of tensor perturbation is suppressed by slow roll parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the equilateral non - gaussianity of g - inflation , at @xmath68 , is about @xmath155 and close to the current observational bound .",
    "the non - gaussianities should be a model independent feature for super - inflation type models which generate blue tensor spectrum , because the perturbations have to behave differently from the background to avoid ghosts .",
    "generalized initial conditions of inflation is left largely unconstrained .",
    "however , the generalized initial conditions are also sources of non - gaussianities .",
    "thus non - gaussianities in the tensor sector would be a test of those class of models .",
    "inflationary particle production is another possible source of tensor modes .",
    "we derived a bound of inflationary hubble scale and energy density for this mechanism to work .",
    "non - gaussianities are also present in the case of particle productions .",
    "we hope to investigate the particle production mechanism and its relation between the blue tensor spectra in a future work .",
    "the current data shows hint of blue @xmath156 .",
    "the models with slow roll suppressed @xmath13 would not be enough to explain such a hint .",
    "on the other hand , from modified initial conditions , external sources , inflation beyond slow roll , modified gravity and some models of matter bounce , blue and large @xmath13 may be produced .",
    "it would be interesting to study those models in more details to see how the fitting of data is improved in those models .",
    "* note added : *    two related works @xcite appeared on arxiv on the same day as ours .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) overlaps with our section [ sec : hints - blue - tensor ] , and @xcite overlaps with section [ sec : infl - gener - init ] .    the data analysis of tensor tilt is also investigated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , within a few days before / after our paper . among those papers , @xcite and @xcite reports a nearly zero central value , with small errorbars @xmath157 ( bicep2 only ) and @xmath158 ( bicep2 + planck + wp , with running of scalar spectral index ) . while the following works prefer blue tilt with considerably larger errorbars : @xcite ( bicep2 only ) , our result ( bicep2 , bicep2 + planck + wp , polarbear ) , @xcite ( bicep2 + planck + wp and bicep2 x keck + planck + wp ) and @xcite ( bicep2 + planck + wmap + bao ) .",
