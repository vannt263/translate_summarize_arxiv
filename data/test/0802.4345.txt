    "there are many routes to minkowski space .",
    "but the most physical one still seems to me via the law of inertia . and even along these lines",
    "alternative approaches exist .",
    "many papers were published in physics and mathematics journals over the last 100 years in which incremental progress was reported as regards the minimal set of hypotheses from which the structure of minkowski space could be deduced .",
    "one could imagine a hesse - diagram - like picture in which all these contributions ( being the nodes ) together with their logical dependencies ( being the directed links ) were depicted .",

    "our modern theoretical view of spacetime is much inspired by the typical hierarchical thinking of mathematics of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century , in which the _ set _ comes first , and then we add various structures on it .",
    "we first think of spacetime as a set and then structure it according to various physical inputs .",
    "but what are the elements of this set ?",
    "recall how georg cantor , in his first article on transfinite set - theory , defined a set : von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen objecten @xmath0 unserer anschauung oder unseres denkens ( welche die ` elemente ' von @xmath1 genannt werden ) zu einem ganzen .

    "i think minkowski felt a need to do so , as his statement quoted above indicates , and also saw the problematic side of it : if we mentally individuate the points ( elements ) of spacetime , we  as physicists  have no other means to do so than to fill up spacetime with actual matter , hoping that this could be done in such a diluted fashion that this matter will not dynamically affect the processes that we are going to describe . in other words : the whole concept of a rigid background spacetime is , from its very beginning , based on an assumption of  at best  approximate validity .",
    "it is important to realise that this does not necessarily refer to general relativity : even if the need to incorporate gravity by a variable and matter - dependent spacetime geometry did not exist would the concept of a rigid background spacetime be of approximate nature , _ provided we think of spacetime points as individuated by actual physical events_.    it is true that modern set theory regards cantor s original definition as too nave , and that for good reasons .",
    "it allows too many `` gatherings - together '' with self - contradictory properties , as exemplified by the infamous _ antinomies _ of classical set theory .",
    "also , modern set theory deliberately stands back from any characterisation of elements in order to not confuse the axioms themselves with their possible _",
    "interpretations_. however , applications to physics require _ interpreted _ axioms , where it remains true that elements of sets are thought of as definite as in cantors original definition .",
    "modern textbooks on special relativity have little to say about this , though an increasing unease seems to raise its voice from certain directions in the philosophy - of - science community ; see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite .",
    "physicists sometimes tend to address points of spacetime as _ potential events _ , but that always seemed to me like poetry , begging the question how a mere potentiality is actually used for individuation . to me",
    "the right attitude seems to admit that the operational justification of the notion of spacetime events is only approximately possible , but nevertheless allow it as primitive element of theorising .",
    "the only thing to keep in mind is to not take mathematical rigour for ultimate physical validity .",
    "the purpose of mathematical rigour is rather to establish the tightest possible bonds between basic assumptions ( axioms ) and decidable consequences . only then can we  in principle ",
    "learn anything through falsification .",
    "the last remark opens another general issue , which is implicit in much of theoretical research , namely how to balance between attempted rigour in drawing consequences and attempted closeness to reality when formulating once starting platform ( at the expense of rigour when drawing consequences ) .",
    "as the mathematical physicists glance & wightman once formulated it in a different context ( that of superselection rules in quantum mechanics ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the theoretical results currently available fall into two categories : rigorous results on approximate models and approximate results in realistic models . _",

    "minkowski space is certainly an approximate model , but to a very good approximation indeed : as global model of spacetime if gravity plays no dynamical rle , and as local model of spacetime in far more general situations .",
    "this justifies looking at some of its rich mathematical structures in detail .",
    "some mathematical background material is provided in the appendices .",
    "consider first the general situation where one is given a set @xmath2 . without any further structure",
    "being specified , the _ automorphisms _ group of @xmath2 would be the group of bijections of @xmath2 , i.e. maps @xmath3 which are injective ( into ) and surjective ( onto ) .",

    "note that in this way of speaking a substructure ( i.e. one being defined by a subset of conditions , relations , objects , etc . ) of a given structure is said to be weaker than the latter .",
    "this way of thinking of structures in terms of their automorphism group is adopted from felix klein s _ erlanger programm _",
    "@xcite in which this strategy is used in an attempt to classify and compare geometries .",
    "this general procedure can be applied to minkowski space , endowed with its usual structure ( see below ) .",
    "we can than ask whether the automorphism group of minkowski space , which we know is the inhomogeneous lorentz group @xmath15 , also called the poincar group , is already the automorphism group of a proper substructure .",
    "if this were the case we would say that the original structure is redundant .",
    "it would then be of interest to try and find a minimal set of structures that already imply the poincar group .",
    "this can be done by trial and error : one starts with some more or less obvious substructure , determine its automorphism group , and compare it to the poincar group .",
    "generically it will turn out larger , i.e. to properly contain @xmath15 . the obvious questions to ask then are : how much larger ? and : what would be a minimal extra condition that eliminates the difference ?      these questions have been asked in connection with various substructures of minkowski space , whose definition is as follows :    [ def : minkowskispace ] * minkowski space * of @xmath16 dimensions , denoted by @xmath17 , is a real @xmath18-dimensional affine space , whose associated real @xmath18-dimensional vector space @xmath19 is endowed with a non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form @xmath20 of signature @xmath21 ( i.e. there exists a basis @xmath22 of @xmath19 such that @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath17 is also endowed with the standard differentiable structure of @xmath24 .",
    "we refer to appendix[sec : affinespaces ] for the definition of affine spaces .",
    "note also that the last statement concerning differentiable structures is put in in view of the strange fact that just for the physically most interesting case , @xmath25 , there exist many inequivalent differentiable structures of @xmath26 .",
    "finally we stress that , at this point , we did not endow minkowski space with an orientation or time orientation .",
    "[ def : poincaregroup ] the * poincar group * in @xmath16 dimensions , which is the same as the * inhomogeneous lorentz group * in @xmath16 dimensions and therefore will be denoted by @xmath27 , is that subgroup of the general affine group of real @xmath18-dimensional affine space , for which the uniquely associated linear maps @xmath28 are elements of the lorentz group @xmath29 , that is , preserve @xmath30 in the sense that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "see appendix[sec : affinemaps ] for the definition of affine maps and the general affine group .",
    "again we stress that since we did not endow minkowski space with any orientation , the poincar group as defined here would not respect any such structure .    as explained in [ sec : affineframes ] , any choice of an affine frame allows us to identify the general affine group in @xmath18 dimensions with the semi - direct product @xmath33 .",
    "that identification clearly depends on the choice of the frame . if we restrict the bases to those where @xmath23 , then @xmath27 can be identified with @xmath34 .",
    "we can further endow minkowski space with an _ orientation _ and , independently , a _ time orientation_. an orientation of an affine space is equivalent to an orientation of its associated vector space @xmath19 . a time orientation is also defined trough a time orientation of @xmath19 , which is explained below .",
    "the subgroup of the poincar group preserving the overall orientation is denoted by @xmath35 ( proper poincar group ) , the one preserving time orientation by @xmath36 ( orthochronous poincar group ) , and @xmath37 denotes the subgroup preserving both ( proper orthochronous poincar group ) .    upon the choice of a basis we may identify @xmath35 with @xmath38 and @xmath37 with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the component of the identity of @xmath41 .",
    "let us add a few more comments about the elementary geometry of minkowski space .",
    "we introduce the following notations : @xmath42 we shall also simply write @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "a vector @xmath45 is called _ timelike , lightlike _ , or _ spacelike _ according to @xmath43 being @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 respectively .",
    "non - spacelike vectors are also called _ causal _ and their set , @xmath49 , is called the _ causal - doublecone_. its interior , @xmath50 , is called the _ chronological - doublecone _ and its boundary , @xmath51 , the _ light - doublecone _ :    [ eq : vecdc ] @xmath52    a linear subspace @xmath53 is called timelike , lightlike , or spacelike according to @xmath54 being indefinite , negative semi - definite but not negative definite , or negative definite respectively . instead of the usual cauchy - schwarz - inequality we have    [ eq : cauchyschwarz ] @xmath55    given a set @xmath56 ( not necessarily a subspace ) , its @xmath30-orthogonal complement is the subspace @xmath57 if @xmath45 is lightlike then @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 is the unique lightlike hyperplane ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec : affinespaces ] ) containing @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the hyperplane @xmath59 is called degenerate because the restriction of @xmath30 to @xmath59 is degenerate . on the other hand , if @xmath60 is timelike / spacelike @xmath59 is spacelike / timelike and @xmath61 .",
    "now the hyperplane @xmath59 is called non - degenerate because the restriction of @xmath30 to @xmath59 is non - degenerate .",
    "given any subset @xmath56 , we can attach it to a point @xmath62 in @xmath63 : @xmath64 in particular , the causal- , chronological- , and light - doublecones at @xmath65 are given by :    [ eq : affdc ] @xmath66    if @xmath67 is a subspace of @xmath19 then @xmath68 is an affine subspace of @xmath63 over @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath67 is time- , light- , or spacelike then @xmath68 is also called time- , light- , or spacelike .",
    "of particular interest are the hyperplanes @xmath69 which are timelike , lightlike , or spacelike according to @xmath60 being spacelike , lightlike , or timelike respectively .",
    "two points @xmath70 are said to be timelike- , lightlike- , or spacelike separated if the line joining them ( equivalently : the vector @xmath71 ) is timelike , lightlike , or spacelike respectively . non - spacelike separated points are also called causally separated and the line though them is called a causal line .",
    "it is easy to show that the relation @xmath72 defines an equivalence relation ( cf .",
    "[ sec : groupactions ] ) on the set of timelike vectors .",
    "( only transitivity is non - trivial , i.e. if @xmath73 and @xmath74 then @xmath75 . to show this , decompose @xmath76 and @xmath77 into their components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath60 .",
    ") each of the two equivalence classes is a _ cone _ in @xmath19 , that is , a subset closed under addition and multiplication with positive numbers .",
    "vectors in the same class are said to have the same time orientation . in the same fashion",
    ", the relation @xmath78 defines an equivalence relation on the set of causal vectors , with both equivalence classes being again cones .",
    "the existence of these equivalence relations is expressed by saying that @xmath63 is _ time orientable_. picking one of the two possible time orientations is then equivalent to specifying a single timelike reference vector , @xmath79 , whose equivalence class of directions may be called the _ future_. this being done we can speak of the future ( or forward , indicated by a superscript @xmath80 ) and past ( or backward , indicated by a superscript @xmath81 ) cones :    [ eq : vecc ] @xmath82    note that @xmath83 and @xmath84 . usually @xmath85 is called the future and @xmath86 the past lightcone . mathematically speaking",
    "this is an abuse of language since , in contrast to @xmath87 and @xmath88 , they are not cones : they are each invariant ( as sets ) under multiplication with positive real numbers , but adding to vectors in @xmath89 will result in a vector in @xmath88 unless the vectors were parallel .    as before",
    ", these cones can be attached to the points in @xmath63 .",
    "we write in a straightforward manner :    [ eq : affc ] @xmath90    the cauchy - schwarz inequalities ( [ eq : cauchyschwarz ] ) result in various generalised triangle - inequalities . clearly , for spacelike vectors , one just has the ordinary triangle inequality .",
    "but for causal or timelike vectors one has to distinguish the cases according to the relative time orientations .",
    "for example , for timelike vectors of equal time orientation , one obtains the reversed triangle inequality : @xmath91 with equality iff @xmath60 and @xmath77 are parallel .",
    "it expresses the geometry behind the ` twin paradox ' .",
    "sometimes a minkowski ` distance function ' @xmath92 is introduced through @xmath93 clearly this is not a distance function in the ordinary sense , since it is neither true that @xmath94 nor that @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .      in this section",
    "we consider general isometries of minkowski space . by this we mean general bijections @xmath97 ( no requirement like continuity or even linearity",
    "is made ) which preserve the minkowski distance ( [ eq : def : minkowskidistance ] ) as well as the time or spacelike character ; hence @xmath98 poincar transformations form a special class of such isometries , namely those which are affine .",
    "are there non - affine isometries ?",
    "one might expect a whole pandora s box full of wild ( discontinuous ) ones .",
    "but , fortunately , they do not exist : any map @xmath28 satisfying @xmath99 for all @xmath60 must be linear . as a warm up , we show    [ thm : nowildisometries ] let @xmath28 be a surjection ( no further conditions ) so that @xmath100 for all @xmath32 , then @xmath9 is linear .",
    "consider @xmath101 .",
    "surjectivity allows to write @xmath102 , so that @xmath103 , which vanishes for all @xmath104",
    ". hence @xmath105 for all @xmath106 , which by non - degeneracy of @xmath30 implies the linearity of @xmath9 .",
    "this shows in particular that any bijection @xmath97 of minkowski space whose associated map @xmath28 , defined by @xmath107 for some chosen basepoint @xmath108 , preserves the minkowski metric must be a poincar transformation .",
    "as already indicated , this result can be considerably strengthened .",
    "but before going into this , we mention a special and important class of linear isometries of @xmath109 , namely reflections at non - degenerate hyperplanes .",
    "the reflection at @xmath59 is defined by @xmath110 their significance is due to the following    let the dimension of @xmath19 be @xmath18 .",
    "any isometry of @xmath109 is the composition of at most @xmath18 reflections .",
    "comprehensive proofs may be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the easier proof for at most @xmath111 reflections is as follows : let @xmath112 be a linear isometry and @xmath45 so that @xmath113 ( which certainly exists ) .",
    "let @xmath114 , then @xmath115 so that @xmath116 and @xmath117 can not simultaneously have zero squares .",
    "so let @xmath118 ( understood as alternatives ) , then @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "hence @xmath60 is eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath121 of the linear isometry given by @xmath122 consider now the linear isometry @xmath123 on @xmath59 with induced bilinear form @xmath124 , which is non - degenerated due to @xmath113 .",
    "we conclude by induction : at each dimension we need at most two reflections to reduce the problem by one dimension .",
    "after @xmath125 steps we have reduced the problem to one dimension , where we need at most one more reflection .",
    "hence we need at most @xmath126 reflections which upon composition with @xmath112 produce the identity . here",
    "we use that any linear isometry in @xmath59 can be canonically extended to @xmath127 by just letting it act trivially on @xmath128 .    note that this proof does not make use of the signature of @xmath30 . in fact , the theorem is true for any signatures ; it only depends on @xmath30 being symmetric and non degenerate .",
    "as already mentioned , theorem[thm : nowildisometries ] can be improved upon , in the sense that the hypothesis for the map being an isometry is replaced by the hypothesis that it merely preserve some relation that derives form the metric structure , but is not equivalent to it .",
    "in fact , there are various such relations which we first have to introduce .",
    "the family of cones @xmath129 defines a partial - order relation ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec : groupactions ] ) , denoted by @xmath130 , on spacetime as follows : @xmath131 iff @xmath132 , i.e. iff @xmath71 is causal and future pointing .",
    "similarly , the family @xmath133 defines a strict partial order , denoted by @xmath134 , as follows : @xmath135 iff @xmath136 , i.e. if @xmath71 is timelike and future pointing .",
    "there is a third relation , called @xmath137 , defined as follows : @xmath138 iff @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath62 is on the future lightcone at @xmath140 .",
    "it is not a partial order due to the lack of transitivity , which , in turn , is due to the lack of the lightcone being a cone ( in the proper mathematical sense explained above ) .",
    "replacing the future ( @xmath80 ) with the past ( @xmath81 ) cones gives the relations @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "it is obvious that the action of @xmath144 ( spatial reflections are permitted ) on @xmath63 maps each of the six families of cones ( [ eq : affc ] ) into itself and therefore leave each of the six relations invariant .",
    "for example : let @xmath135 and @xmath145 , then @xmath146 and @xmath71 future pointing , but also @xmath147 and @xmath148 future pointing , hence @xmath149 .",
    "another set of ` obvious ' transformations of @xmath63 leaving these relations invariant is given by all dilations : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the constant dilation - factor and @xmath152 the centre .",
    "this follows from @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and the positivity of @xmath155 . since translations are already contained in @xmath144 , the group generated by @xmath144 and all @xmath156 is the same as the group generated by @xmath144 and all @xmath156 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "a seemingly difficult question is this : what are the most general transformations of @xmath63 that preserve those relations ? here we understand ` transformation ' synonymously with ` bijective map ' , so that each transformation @xmath9 has in inverse @xmath10 . `",
    "preserving the relation ' is taken to mean that @xmath9 _ and _ @xmath10 preserve the relation .",
    "then the somewhat surprising answer to the question just posed is that , in three or more spacetime dimensions , there are no other such transformations besides those already listed :    let @xmath157 stand for any of the relations @xmath158 and let @xmath159 be a bijection of @xmath63 with @xmath160 , such that @xmath161 implies @xmath162 and @xmath163 . then @xmath159 is the composition of an lorentz transformation in @xmath144 with a dilation .",
    "these results were proven by a.d.alexandrov and independently by e.c .",
    "a good review of alexandrov s results is @xcite ; zeeman s paper is @xcite .",
    "the restriction to @xmath160 is indeed necessary , as for @xmath164 the following possibility exists : identify @xmath165 with @xmath166 and the bilinear form @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "set @xmath169 and @xmath170 and define @xmath171 by @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is any smooth function with @xmath174 .",
    "this defines an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath166 which transforms the set of lines @xmath175 const . and @xmath176 const .",
    "respectively into each other .",
    "hence it preserves the families of cones ( [ eq : def : affcausalc ] ) . since these transformations need not be affine linear they are not generated by dilations and lorentz transformations .",
    "these results may appear surprising since without a continuity requirement one might expect all sorts of wild behaviour to allow for more possibilities .",
    "however , a little closer inspection reveals a fairly obvious reason for why continuity is implied here . consider the case in which a transformation @xmath159 preserves the families @xmath133 and @xmath177 .",
    "the open diamond - shaped sets ( usually just called ` open diamonds ' ) , @xmath178 are obviously open in the standard topology of @xmath63 ( which is that of @xmath179 ) . note that at least one of the intersections in ( [ eq : opendiamonds ] ) is always empty .",
    "conversely , is is also easy to see that each open set of @xmath63 contains an open diamond .",
    "hence the topology that is defined by taking the @xmath180 as sub - base ( the basis being given by their finite intersections ) is equivalent to the standard topology of @xmath63 .",
    "but , by hypothesis , @xmath159 and @xmath181 preserves the cones @xmath182 and therefore open sets , so that @xmath159 must , in fact , be a homeomorphism .",
    "there is no such _ obvious _ continuity input if one makes the strictly weaker requirement that instead of the cones ( [ eq : affc ] ) one only preserves the doublecones ( [ eq : affdc ] ) .",
    "does that allow for more transformations , except for the obvious time reflection ?",
    "the answer is again in the negative .",
    "the following result was shown by alexandrov ( see his review @xcite ) and later , in a different fashion , by borchers and hegerfeld  @xcite :    [ thm : borchershegerfeld ] let @xmath183 denote any of the relations : @xmath184 iff @xmath185 , @xmath184 iff @xmath186 , or @xmath184 iff @xmath187 .",

    "the answer is , that it determines it to be a subgroup of the 11-parameter group of poincar transformations and constant rescalings , which is as close to the poincar group as possibly imaginable .",
    "alexandrov s theorem is , to my knowledge , the closest analog in minkowskian geometry to the famous theorem of beckman and quarles @xcite , which refers to euclidean geometry and reads as follows under slightly weaker hypotheses : they allowed the map @xmath9 to be ` many - valued ' , that is , to be a map @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the set of non - empty subsets of @xmath179 , such that @xmath193 for any @xmath194 and any @xmath195 .",

    "we wish to discuss the extent to which the law of inertia already determines the automorphism group of spacetime .",
    "the law of inertia privileges a subset of paths in spacetime form among all paths ; it defines a so - called _ path structure _  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these privileged paths correspond to the motions of privileged objects called _",
    "free particles_. the existence of such privileged objects is by no means obvious and must be taken as a contingent and particularly kind property of nature .",
    "it has been known for long @xcite@xcite@xcite how to operationally construct timescales and spatial reference frames relative to which free particles will move uniformly and on straight lines respectively  all of them ! ( a summary of these papers is given in @xcite . ) these special timescales and spatial reference frames were termed _ inertial _ by ludwig lange  @xcite .",
    "their existence must again be taken as a very particular and very kind feature of nature .",
    "note that ` uniform in time ' and ` spatially straight ' together translate to ` straight in spacetime ' .",
    "we also emphasise that ` straightness ' of ensembles of paths can be characterised intrinsically , e.g. , by the desargues property  @xcite .",
    "all this is true if free particles are given .",
    "we do not discuss at this point whether and how one should characterise them independently ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "the spacetime structure so defined is usually referred to as _ projective_. it it not quite that of an affine space , since the latter provides in addition each straight line with a distinguished two - parameter family of parametrisations , corresponding to a notion of _ uniformity _ with which the line is traced through .",
    "such a privileged parametrisation of spacetime paths is not provided by the law of inertia , which only provides privileged parametrisations of spatial paths , which we already took into account in the projective structure of spacetime . instead",
    ", an affine structure of spacetime may once more be motivated by another contingent property of nature , shown by the existence of elementary clocks ( atomic frequencies ) which do define the same uniformity structure on inertial world lines  all of them !",
    "once more this is a highly non - trivial and very kind feature of nature . in this way",
    "we would indeed arrive at the statement that spacetime is an affine space .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in this subsection , the affine group already emerges as automorphism group of inertial structures without the introduction of elementary clocks .",
    "first we recall the main theorem of affine geometry . for",
    "that we make the following    [ def : collineation ] three points in an affine space are called * collinear * iff they are contained in a single line .",
    "a map between affine spaces is called a * collineation * iff it maps each triple of collinear points to collinear points .    note",
    "that in this definition no other condition is required of the map , like , e.g. , injectivity .",
    "the main theorem now reads as follows :    [ thm : collareaffine ] a bijective collineation of a real affine space of dimension @xmath16 is necessarily an affine map .    a proof may be found in @xcite . that the theorem is non - trivial can , e.g. , be seen from the fact that it is not true for complex affine spaces .",
    "the crucial property of the real number field is that it does not allow for a non - trivial automorphisms ( as field ) .",
    "a particular consequence of theorem[thm : collareaffine ] is that bijective collineation are necessarily continuous ( in the natural topology of affine space ) .",
    "this is of interest for the applications we have in mind for the following reason : consider the set @xmath212 of all lines in some affine space @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath212 has a natural topology induced from @xmath2 .",
    "theorem[thm : collareaffine ] now implies that bijective collineations of @xmath2 act as homeomorphism of @xmath212 .",
    "consider an open subset @xmath213 and the subset of all collineations that fix @xmath214 ( as set , not necessarily its points ) .",
    "then these collineations also fix the boundary @xmath215 of @xmath214 in @xmath212 . for example , if @xmath214 is the set of all timelike lines in minkowski space , i.e. , with a slope less than some chosen value relative to some fixed direction , then it follows that the bijective collineations which together with their inverse map timelike lines to timelike lines also maps the lightcone to the lightcone .",
    "it immediately follows that it must be the composition of a poincar transformation as a constant dilation .",
    "note that this argument also works in two spacetime dimensions , where the alexandrov - zeeman result does not hold .",
    "the application we have in mind is to inertial motions , which are given by lines in affine space . in that respect theorem[thm : collareaffine ] is not quite appropriate .",
    "its hypotheses are weaker than needed , insofar as it would suffice to require straight lines to be mapped to straight lines .",
    "but , more importantly , the hypotheses are also stronger than what seems physically justifiable , insofar as not every line is realisable by an inertial motion .",
    "in particular , one would like to know whether theorem[thm : collareaffine ] can still be derived by restricting to _ slow collineations _",
    ", which one may define by the property that the corresponding lines should have a slope less than some non - zero angle ( in whatever measure , as long as the set of slow lines is open in the set of all lines ) from a given ( time-)direction .",
    "this is indeed the case , as one may show from going through the proof of theorem[thm : collareaffine ] . slightly easier to prove is the following :    [ thm : timelikecollareaffine ]",
    "let @xmath159 be a bijection of real @xmath18-dimensional affine space that maps slow lines to slow lines , then @xmath159 is an affine map .",
    "a proof may be found in @xcite . if ` slowness ' is defined via the lightcone of a minkowski metric @xmath30 , one immediately obtains the result that the affine maps must be composed from poincar transformations and dilations .",

    "hence @xmath220 with @xmath233 .",
    "this can be applied as follows : if @xmath234 is affine and maps lightlike lines to lightlike lines , then the associated linear map @xmath28 maps lightlike vectors to lightlike vectors . hence @xmath235 vanishes if @xmath236 vanishes and therefore @xmath237 by lemma[thm : samekernelpropto ] . since @xmath238 is timelike if @xmath60 is timelike , @xmath239 is positive . hence we may define @xmath240 and have @xmath241 for all @xmath242 , saying that @xmath243 is a lorentz transformation .",
    "@xmath9 is the composition of a lorentz transformation and a dilation by @xmath244 .",
    "as is well known , the two main ingredients in special relativity are the principle of relativity ( henceforth abbreviated by pr ) and the principle of the constancy of light .",

    "we wish to address the complementary question : under what conditions and to what extent can the rp _",
    "alone _ justify the poincar group ?",
    "this question was first addressed by ignatowsky  @xcite , who showed that under a certain set of technical assumptions ( not consistently spelled out by him ) the rp alone suffices to arrive at a spacetime symmetry group which is either the inhomogeneous galilei or the inhomogeneous lorentz group , the latter for some yet undetermined limiting velocity @xmath245 .",
    "more precisely , what is actually shown in this fashion is , as we will see , that the relativity group must contain either the proper orthochronous galilei or lorentz group , if the group is required to comprise at least spacetime translations , spatial rotations , and boosts ( velocity transformations ) .",
    "what we hence gain is the group - theoretic insight of how these transformations must combine into a common group , given that they form a group at all .",
    "we do not learn anything about other transformations , like spacetime reflections or dilations , whose existence we neither required nor ruled out at this level .    the work of ignatowsky was put into a logically more coherent form by franck & rothe  @xcite@xcite , who showed that some of the technical assumptions could be dropped .",
    "further formal simplifications were achieved by berzi & gorini @xcite .",
    "below we shall basically follow their line of reasoning , except that we do not impose the continuity of the transformations as a requirement , but conclude it from their preservation of the inertial structure plus bijectivity .",
    "see also @xcite for an alternative discussion on the level of lie algebras .    for further determination of the automorphism group of spacetime",
    "we invoke the following principles :    * homogeneity of spacetime .",
