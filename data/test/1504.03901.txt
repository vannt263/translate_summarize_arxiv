    "in recent years there has been a renewed interest@xcite in the problem of anderson localization on the cayley tree ( ct ) ( in the infinite limit known as a bethe lattice ) .",
    "this interest is mainly motivated by the connection between the many body localization phenomenon @xcite and the ct .",
    "many body localization may be viewed as a localization problem in fock space , where the coupling between states due to electron - electron interactions resembles the ct@xcite .    in the context of the anderson localization on the ct@xcite",
    ", one can envisage that the entanglement entropy ( ee ) will play an important role in clarifying the ct localization properties . in this ee",
    "could join other methods such as level spacing statistics for the ct systems @xcite , and for many - body interacting systems believed to map on an effective ct in fock space @xcite .",
    "prior to addressing the challenging question of the ee on a disordered one must clarify the behavior of the ee for a clean ct .",
    "this is our main goal in this paper .",
    "the ee is a measure of the entanglement between two regions , a and b , of a system which is in some pure state .",
    "this measure is given by the von - neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , @xmath0 , of region a : @xmath1 it has been shown that the ee is a very useful measure to locate and analyze quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the ground state ee typically scales like the _ boundary area _ of the region @xcite .",
    "thus , for one dimensional systems , one would expect that the ee will be constant .",
    "this is correct for gaped systems , but for metallic systems there is a logarithmic correction , and ee grows like @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the size of the sub - system @xmath4 . for insulators the ee should not depend on the region s size .",
    "therefore for disordered systems the ee can give an indication for the localization length @xmath5 ; we expect the ee to grow logarithmically for @xmath6 , and to saturate for @xmath7@xcite .",
    "applying this picture to the ct is not straight forward .",
    "unlike the situation for regular @xmath8 dimensional systems , where for any regular simply connected area , the boundary area is proportional to @xmath9 , for the ct things are more complicated .",
    "one expects that a region which is connected to the rest of the graph only at one point ( a branch of the tree ) , will show a different ee than a region centered at the root of the tree where the boundary area grows as @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is related to the coordination number of the tree ) . in this paper",
    "we aim to calculate the ee for a clean ct as a stepping stone towards investigating the ee in a disordered ct .",
    "we shall pay special attention to the different behavior for different regions and the physical meaning of these results .",
    "a ct is @xcite a simple connected undirected graph , with no closed loops . a ct of coordination number @xmath12 and @xmath13 generations is described as follows .",
    "there is a root vertex , which we denote @xmath14 .",
    "the root is linked to @xmath12 vertexes belonging to the @xmath15 generation , which we denote @xmath16 .",
    "each of those is linked to another @xmath17 vertexes on the @xmath18 generation , so that @xmath19 is related to @xmath20 , and so on .",
    "every vertex is linked to @xmath12 others , except those belonging to the last generation , which are linked to only one vertex each . unlike the _ bethe lattice _ , ct is finite , it s boundary being a non - negligible part of the entire tree : the total number of vertexes in the tree is @xmath21 , while the last generation contains @xmath22 vertexes",
    ". therefore , even for @xmath23 the boundary is important , as is well known in the context of localization on ct @xcite .     and @xmath24 generations , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] +    another noteworthy property of the ct",
    "is it s lack of dimension - since the number of vertexes grows exponentially with @xmath13 , we can not define the dimension of this system . on the other hand ,",
    "any two vertexes are connected by a single path , what gives the ct a one - dimensional character . both of these features",
    "are reflected in the scaling of the ee we obtained .",
    "first we solve the tight - binding hamiltonian for a clean ct .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written , using the notation introduced previously , in the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is an annihilation ( creation ) operator on vertex @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the index of the first vertex of the @xmath29 s generation .",
    "it will be convenient to define a new basis , using the operators @xmath30 , defined as follows .",
    "we find an orthonormal basis in the @xmath15 generation , @xmath31 , and for each such operator we define it s successors in the following generations @xmath32 as a reflection of @xmath33 in the @xmath34 s generation . for example , if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 _ etc_. similarly we find a basis in every generation , composed of operators other than the successors of the previous generations , and define its successors in the next generations .",
    "we denote each such operator by @xmath37 , where @xmath34 is the generation in which this operator acts , @xmath38 is the generation in which it s first fore - father acts , and @xmath39 is it s fore - father s index inside the @xmath38 s generation . among these operators there",
    "is one important group that originates from the root , which we shall denote @xmath40 or @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "they are symmetric in the sense that they treat each generation as one unit , @xmath43 @xmath44 using this representation , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath45\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the symmetric term @xmath46 thus all terms , except for @xmath47 , are a sum of independent one - dimensional lattices .",
    "one should note the exponentially increasing number of such lattices .",
    "the solution is given by the transformation @xmath48\\hat b_j^{\\gamma,\\nu}\\ ] ] so that @xmath49 and the spectrum is @xmath50 for the symmetric term ( [ h_sym ] ) a similar solution was obtained by chen _ _ et al.__@xcite , including the boundary condition for finite @xmath13 .",
    "in order to calculate the ee we use the relation @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix _ in region a_. for a one - particle state , the correlation can be written in the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the eigenstate in region a. thus one eigenvector is @xmath54 , with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 is hermitian , any other eigenvector is orthogonal to @xmath54 , and its corresponding eigenvalue therefore vanishes , so that the ee is simply @xmath57 .",
    "we have calculated the ee for several representative one - particle states in a ct of @xmath58 .",
    "a typical state is : @xmath59\\cdot\\\\   \\cdot\\left[\\sum_{i = p_j}^{p_j+2^{j-2}-1}\\hat c_i^{\\dagger}-   \\sum_{l = p_j+2^{j-2}}^{p_j+2^{j-1}-1}\\hat c_l^{\\dagger}\\right]\\ket{\\emptyset }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which resides on two of the branches . for this state",
    ", we let one branch be region a ( see fig .",
    "[ ct_as_1_branch ] ) , and obtain @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , regardless of the number of generations .",
    ", when we take one branch ( solid line ) or a part of it ( dashed ) to be the subsystem .",
    "( color online),title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] +    another possible partition is to define region a as a part of one branch ( see in fig .",
    "[ ct_as_1_branch ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath62 for this partition where region a is defined as the last @xmath63 generations of one branch is @xmath64}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}\\right),\\ ] ] which , in the appropriate limit , is proportional to the relative number of generations in region a.    for the more challenging case of a many - particle state , the correlation matrix becomes more complicated , so we diagonalize it numerically .",
    "the many particle state can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the indicies of the occupied single particle states , leading to a correlation matrix @xmath67 let us first consider the ground state ee of a single branch of the ct ( see in fig .",
    "[ branchingpic ] ) for the half - filled case .",
    "since a branch is connected to the rest of the system only at one point , one would expect from the area law that the ee will be constant . nevertheless ,",
    "since the ct has no gap , which is similar to the situation in metallic 1d system , a logarithmic correction is expected .",
    "indeed , we find a logarithmic dependence for the ct , but unlike the 1d system it does not depend on the size of the system , but rather on the number of generations @xmath13 in the ct ( or , equivalently , on the number of generations @xmath63 in the subsystem , where in this case @xmath68 ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath58 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a decaying alternating term typical to systems with open boundary conditions@xcite ( fig . [ ee_1_branch ] ) .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath71 of the logarithmic term is reminiscence of the behavior of an open boundary 1d system , where if one bisects a system of length @xmath72 in the middle the ee grows as @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the fact that for the ee on a ct the number of generations @xmath13 plays the same role as the length @xmath72 for a 1d system stems from the structure of the eigenstates of the ct demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ ct_eigenstates ] .",
    "it is interesting to point out that for the ct the ratio of the sites on a branch to the overall number of sites is nearly constant ( @xmath74 ) for any generation @xmath13 larger than @xmath75 , again similar to the situation for the bisected 1d system .     as function of @xmath63 the number of generations in the subsystem .",
    "h ere @xmath68 .",
    "the black squares represent an even number of generations and the red circles represent odd @xmath63 s , separated in order to emphasize the alternating term .",
    "the red lines correspond to @xmath76 for even @xmath63 s and @xmath77 for odd @xmath63 s .",
    "the blue line in between is @xmath78 , which corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the ee . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    on the other hand , for an excited state we find an exponential growth of the ee ( fig .",
    "[ ee_1branch_excited ] ) , reflecting the growth in the number of sites per generation .",
    "this is expected since for an excited state the ee should obey a volume law .",
    "nevertheless , this is in stark difference to the one dimensional case for which excited states ee grows linearly .",
    "thus , for the ee of a branch of the ct there is a huge change between the ground state ee and the excited state ee not seen in more standard models .",
    "this may lead to a huge influence of localization on low - lying excitations @xcite .",
    "for a highly excited state represented by the black squares .",
    "the ee grows as @xmath79 ( red line ) since for an excited state the ee is proportional to the volume.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    a similar form of dissection is to define a site residing @xmath63 generations away from the boundary and all the sites connecting it to the boundary as region a , so that a is connected to the rest of the tree only at one point ( see in fig .",
    "[ branchingpic ] ) , just like in the previous case .",
    "as expected , we get the logarithmic dependence for this case also ( fig . [ branching ] ) .",
    "generations around the root to be region a ( solid circles ) or taking a branch ( big dashed circle ) or a sub - branch ( small dashed circle).,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] +     generations , where the total number of generations in the tree is @xmath80 .",
    "the black squares represent even @xmath63 s , with the red line corresponding to @xmath81 , and the red circles are for odd @xmath63 s , with the line corresponding to @xmath82.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    a different obvious way to cut the ct into two different regions is to define the root and the sites belonging to the first @xmath63 generations as region a , and the rest of the sites belonging to the higher generations as region @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ branchingpic ] ) . in this case",
    "the area of contact between the two regions is proportional to @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and therefore according to the area law we expect the ground state ee to be exponentially dependent on @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , in this case the ee behaves as @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ ee_generation ] ) .",
    "since for such a dissection the volume ( number of sites ) within region a is equal to @xmath87 , i.e. , grows exponentially with @xmath63 . also for a highly excited state we find the ee to follow @xmath88 , as expected .",
    "thus , for this form of dissection there is no qualitative difference between the ee of the ground state and the behavior of an excited state as function of @xmath63 .",
    "generations around the root ( including the root itself ) and the rest of the ct with @xmath58 for the ground state ( black squares ) and for a highly excited state ( red circles ) . in both cases",
    "the ee grows exponentially ( the lines , corresponding to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ) , since there is no qualitative difference in the growth as function of @xmath63 between the interface area and the volume.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +",
    "in this paper we calculated the ee for the ground state and excited states of a clean ct . utilizing an exact expression for the single - particle eigenfunctions of the ct developed in this paper in order to to obtain a correlation matrix from which the ee of a many - particle state can be calculated",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the ee may show dramatic differences depending on the way the ct is partitioned into two regions .",
    "if the ct is dissected into a branch connected in a single point to the ct , a logarithmic dependence on the number of generations in the branch is found , which reflects the one dimensional character of the states of the ct . on the other hand ,",
    "excited states on the branch show a completely different ee behavior , namely an exponential dependence on the number of generations in the branch .",
    "this logarithmic to exponential change in the entanglement between the ground state and the excited state is unique to the entanglement on the ct . on the other hand",
    ", the ground state ee shows a completely different behavior for a different sort of partition - where the root and the first @xmath63 generations are considered as one region . in this case an exponential dependence on @xmath63 is found , which reflects the growth in the number of sites on the surface .",
    "in contrast to dissecting by branch , here the excited states ee ( which remains the volume law ) does not show a dramatic difference when compared to the ground state ee .",
    "thus , how one defines the separation into two regions has a crucial influence on the behavior of the ee .",
    "these large fluctuations in the ee could become even stronger for other types of complex ( random ) networks , such as small world graphs , erds - rnyi graphs and scale free networks @xcite .",
    "these behaviors predict a strong influence of disorder on the ee of a ct .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the localization length in 1d may be inferred from the saturation of the ee on the length scale of the localization length . for the ct one expects that for a region around the root and the first @xmath63 generations where the increase in the ee is exponential this tool will be more sensitive than for the 1d system where the growth is logarithmic",
    ". it will be also very interesting to compare the effect of the localization on the ee of a branch .",
    "will it be similar to the 1d case ?",
    "another question is whether the non ergodic phase predicted for the ct @xcite may be detected in the behavior of the ee ."
