    "by using direct numerical simulations @xcite and bubble / cavitation visualization experiments @xcite , it has been established that turbulence contains vortex tubes .",
    "regions of intense vorticity are organized into tubes .",
    "their radii and lengths are , respectively , of the orders of the kolmogorov length @xmath1 and the integral length @xmath2 .",
    "their lifetimes are several turnover times of the largest eddies .",
    "the vortex tubes occupy a small fraction of the volume and are embedded in a background flow that is random and of large scales ( see also reviews @xcite ) . here",
    "we study vortex tubes in velocity fields of experimental turbulence as a function of the reynolds number re@xmath3 .",
    "especially when the reynolds number is high , effects of vortex tubes on the velocity field are of interest .",
    "the velocity signal at small scales is enhanced only in a fraction of the volume @xcite .",
    "this small - scale intermittency is attributable to vortex tubes @xcite . with increasing the reynolds number ,",
    "turbulence becomes more intermittent @xcite .",
    "large values of the reynolds number , re@xmath4 , are achieved only in experiments , where a measurement is made with a probe suspended in the flow and a one - dimensional cut of the velocity field is obtained .",
    "the measurement often deals with the velocity component in the mean - flow direction alone ( hereafter , the streamwise velocity @xmath5 ) , but the transverse velocity @xmath6 is more suited to detecting circulation flows such as those associated with vortex tubes @xcite .",
    "a simultaneous measurement of the two velocity components is desirable .    for laboratory experiments ,",
    "there are several possible configurations . among them , a flow downstream of a turbulence - generating grid is preferable .",
    "this grid turbulence is isotropic and free from external influences such as mean shear , and hence is suited to isolating effects of vortex tubes at each of the scales .",
    "although the reynolds number is not very high and the inertial subrange is almost absent , grid turbulence is a natural step from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence with small re@xmath3 values to laboratory or field experiments of anisotropic turbulence with very large re@xmath3 values .",
    "we carried out simultaneous measurements of the streamwise and transverse velocities in grid turbulence with a range of the reynolds number , re@xmath0330 . since our wind tunnels as well as our grids were large ,",
    "the re@xmath3 values exceed those in past studies of grid turbulence .",
    "the exception is a special but old experiment with high air pressure @xcite , for which the reynolds number was in the range re@xmath7670 .",
    "thus our data provide a unique opportunity to study vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence with a wide range of the reynolds number .",
    "the preliminary studies had been reported by mouri et al .",
    "@xcite , but the present data are new and are analyzed more carefully and extensively .    in sec .",

    "[ s4 ] , a conditional averaging technique is used to extract typical intermittency patterns from the data .",
    "the patterns turn out to be consistent with velocity profiles expected for the model tube .",
    "also , statistics of velocity increments are used to study the energetical importance of vortex tubes as a function of the scale . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , we present our conclusion with remarks for future experimental researches .",
    "the experiments were done in two wind tunnels of meteorological research institute .",
    "their test sections were of 0.8 @xmath8 0.8 @xmath8 3 and 3 @xmath8 2 @xmath8 18 m in size .",
    "turbulence was produced by placing a grid across the entrance to the test section .",
    "the grid consisted of two layers of uniformly spaced rods , the axes of which were perpendicular to each other .",
    "we used three grids .",
    "the separations of the axes of their adjacent rods were @xmath9 = 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.4 m. the cross sections of the rods were , respectively , 0.02 @xmath8 0.02 , 0.04 @xmath8 0.04 , and 0.06 @xmath8 0.06 m. the mean wind was set to be @xmath10 @xmath11 4 , 8 , 12 , or 16 m  s@xmath12 .",
    "the streamwise ( @xmath13 ) and transverse ( @xmath6 ) velocities were measured simultaneously with a hot - wire anemometer .",
    "the anemometer was composed of a crossed - wire probe and a constant temperature system .",
    "the probe was positioned on the tunnel axis .",
    "the hot wires were platinum - coated tungsten filaments , 5 @xmath14 m in diameter , 1.25 mm in effective length , 1 mm in separation , 280@xmath15c in temperature , and oriented at @xmath16 to the mean - flow direction . the calibration was done before and after each of the measurements .",
    "the signal was low - pass filtered at @xmath17 = 416 khz with 24 db per octave and sampled digitally at @xmath18 = 832 khz with 16-bit resolution . to avoid aliasing ,",
    "the sampling frequency was set to be twice of the filter cutoff frequency , @xmath19 .",
    "the entire length of the signal was 2 @xmath8 10@xmath20 points , which is large enough to guarantee the convergence of the statistics @xcite .",
    "for each set of the grid and the mean wind speed , measurements were made at several positions downstream of the grid .",
    "we first computed the flatness factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes an average .",
    "the data with the flatness factors being close to the gaussian value of 3 were used in further analyses because we are to study fully developed turbulence .",
    "if the measurement position is too close to or far from the grid , the turbulence is still developing or already decaying , and its flatness factors are different from the gaussian value @xcite .",
    "except for the measurements done in the @xmath24 m tunnel , the flow was almost isotropic .",
    "the ratio between the streamwise- and transverse - velocity dispersions @xmath25 was close to unity .",
    "the turbulence level , i.e. , the ratio of the root - mean - square streamwise fluctuation @xmath26 to the mean streamwise velocity @xmath10 , was always less than 10% .",
    "this good characteristic of grid turbulence allows us to rely on the frozen - eddy hypothesis of taylor @xcite , @xmath27 = @xmath28 , which converts temporal variations into spatial variations in the mean - wind direction .    to obtain the highest spatial resolution",
    ", we set @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath29 is close to the probe size , @xmath30 mm .",
    "since the probe size is greater than the kolmogorov length , 0.20.5 mm , the smallest - scale motions of the flow were filtered out .",
    "the present resolution is nevertheless typical of hot - wire anemometry .",
    "although the relief technique achieves a higher resolution @xcite , it is applicable only to the transverse velocity .",
    "consequently we obtained 10 sets of turbulence data .",
    "the experimental conditions are summarized in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the flow parameters such as the integral length @xmath2 , the kolmogorov length @xmath1 , the taylor microscale @xmath31 , and the reynolds number re@xmath3 are also summarized there .",
    "before describing our experimental results , it is helpful to present a model for a vortex tube , burgers vortex @xcite .",
    "this model is an axisymmetric steady circulation in a strain field . in cylindrical coordinates ,",
    "the circulation and the strain field are written respectively as    @xmath32    \\quad ( a > 0),\\ ] ]    and @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the kinematic viscosity . the above eq .",
    "( [ eq1a ] ) describes a rigid - body rotation for small radii , and a circulation decaying in radius for large radii .",
    "the velocity is maximal at @xmath35 = @xmath36 = @xmath37 .",
    "thus @xmath36 is regarded as the tube radius .",
    "suppose that the vortex tube penetrates the @xmath38 plane at the point @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 axes are , respectively , in the streamwise and transverse directions .",
    "if the direction of the tube axis is @xmath42 in spherical coordinates , the streamwise ( @xmath5 ) and transverse ( @xmath6 ) components of the circulation flow @xmath43 along the @xmath40 axis are    @xmath44    and @xmath45    with @xmath46 likewise , for the radial inflow @xmath47 of the strain field , the streamwise and transverse components are    @xmath48    and @xmath49    if the vortex tube passes close to the probe ( @xmath50 ) and the tube is not heavily inclined ( @xmath51 ) , the transverse velocity is dominated by the circulation flow .",
    "the streamwise velocity is dominated by the radial inflow .",
    "this situation is of particular interest . if @xmath52 , the tube signal is weak . if @xmath53 , the transverse velocity is dominated by the radial inflow , which is of large scale and does not contribute to the small - scale intermittency .",
    "the velocity profiles of vortex tubes with @xmath50 and @xmath51 are nearly the same @xcite . however , as implied by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the radius @xmath54 of a tube observed along the streamwise direction is different from its intrinsic radius @xmath36 as @xmath55 .",
    "thus , even if the intrinsic radii of the vortex tubes are the same , they contribute to a range of the scales .",
    "hereafter we describe our experimental results . except for fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , the following diagrams present the results only for the experiments 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , and 10 ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "we nevertheless obtained consistent results for the other experiments .",
    "the streamwise - velocity increment @xmath56 = @xmath57 or the transverse - velocity increment @xmath58 = @xmath59 is enhanced in an intermittency event .",
    "we obtain velocity patterns typical of the intermittency events by averaging signals centered at the position where the transverse - velocity increment is enhanced over its root - mean - square value by more than a factor of 3 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the scale @xmath61 is set to be the spatial resolution @xmath29 .",
    "such an event is detected 2.15.9 times per the integral length .",
    "when the increment is negative , we invert the sign of the @xmath6 signal .",
    "the numerical factor of 3 in our above criterion comes from a compromise . if the factor is larger , the total number of the events is smaller , and hence statistical uncertainty in the velocity patterns is more significant",
    ". if the factor is smaller , the velocity patterns are less representative of intermittency .",
    "it was nevertheless ascertained that our following results depend only weakly on the choice of the numerical factor if it is in the range 24 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "the @xmath5 pattern is shown separately for @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath64 ( designated , respectively , as @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) . for reference ,",
    "we show velocity profiles ( [ eq2b ] ) and ( [ eq4a ] ) of a burgers vortex with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the tube radius @xmath36 was determined so as to reproduce the @xmath6 pattern for each of the experiments .",
    "the @xmath6 pattern of grid turbulence is close to the profile of a burgers vortex @xcite .",
    "vortex tubes are surely responsible for small - scale intermittency in the transverse velocity .",
    "the radii @xmath36 of the vortex tubes are estimated to be several of the kolmogorov length @xmath1 , @xmath36 @xmath11 ( 67 ) @xmath1 , regardless of the reynolds number re@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "since these estimates are well above the @xmath61 values , they should represent typical radii of vortex tubes .",
    "especially when the reynolds number is high , the @xmath6 pattern is extended as compared with the profile of a burgers vortex .",
    "there should be additional contributions from vortex sheets , for which the velocity signal exhibits some kind of step , and also from vortex tubes with @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath69 patterns of grid turbulence appear to be dominated by the circulation flows @xmath43 of vortex tubes passing the probe at some distances @xmath70 [ eq . ( [ eq2a ] ) ] .",
    "there is no significance of the radial inflow @xmath47 of the strain field [ eq .",
    "( [ eq4a ] ) ] , except that the @xmath66 pattern has a larger amplitude and is detected 1.31.5 times more frequently than the @xmath65 pattern .",
    "a vortex tube is not always oriented to the stretching direction @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity pattern is normalized by the kolmogorov velocity @xmath71 .",
    "this normalized amplitude is nearly the same for different reynolds numbers .",
    "if normalized by the root - mean - square velocity fluctuation @xmath26 or @xmath72 , the amplitude is smaller at a higher reynolds number .",
    "the typical strength of vortex tubes appears to scale with the kolmogorov velocity rather than the root - mean - square velocity fluctuation , although the present result is biased toward strong tubes .",
    "the @xmath69 patterns are embedded in one - sided excursions , @xmath73 a few tenths of @xmath26 @xmath74 0 , which extends to @xmath40 @xmath11 @xmath75 .",
    "this could be due to an artifact of our measurement or analysis .",
    "for example , the streamwise velocity has a fluctuation of the order @xmath26 over the scale @xmath2 .",
    "thus the speed at which a vortex tube passes the probe is higher or lower than the mean wind speed .",
    "the tube radius estimated with the frozen - eddy hypothesis is accordingly smaller or larger than its intrinsic @xmath54 value . since the scale @xmath76 is at around the typical tube radius @xmath36 , vortex tubes with @xmath77 and",
    "hence @xmath78 are more numerous than those with @xmath79 .",
    "fast - moving vortex tubes with @xmath78 are captured in our conditional averaging for the scale @xmath61 and could cause the observed @xmath5 excursions . alternatively , large - scale flows that are responsible for the excursions could preferentially generate vortex tubes .",
    "for the larger scales @xmath80 , our conditional averaging yields nearly the same patterns as those in fig .",
    "velocity signals at large scales reflect vortex tubes that are inclined to the mean - wind direction ( sec .",
    "large - radius vortex tubes could be also important . with increasing the scale still more , the background flow is increasingly predominant ( sec .",
    "[ s4c ] ) .",
    "it is increasingly difficult to capture vortex tubes .",
    "velocity patterns are extracted also for enhancements of the streamwise - velocity increment @xmath56 at the scale @xmath76 .",
    "the results for @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , while those for @xmath82 are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath6 pattern was obtained by conditioning over the sign of the local slope .",
    "since the @xmath6 pattern is close to the profile of a burgers vortex , intermittency in the streamwise velocity is also attributable to vortex tubes .",
    "the tube radii are several of the kolmogorov length . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5 pattern is explained by the circulation flow @xmath43 passing the probe at some distance @xmath70 .",
    "the radial inflow @xmath47 is also important to the @xmath5 pattern for the event @xmath82 , which is detected 1.62.5 times more frequently than the event @xmath81 ( see also sec .  [ s4d ] ) .      to study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes , we study the probability density distribution of an interval @xmath83 between successive enhancements of the transverse - velocity increment , @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath84 is computed at the scale @xmath76 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "the probability density distribution has an exponential tail that appears linear on the semi - log plot ( dotted lines ) .",
    "this exponential distribution of the interval is characteristic of random , independent , and rare events @xcite .",
    "however , at a small interval that is several times the kolmogorov scale @xmath1 , the distribution has a pronounced peak .",
    "vortex tubes tend to cluster together @xcite .    with increasing the reynolds number re@xmath3 , the probability density distribution becomes to have a more pronounced peak .",
    "the clustering of vortex tubes becomes more significant .",
    "figures [ f1][f3 ] actually show that the intermittency patterns at high reynolds numbers are somewhat uneven .      for velocity increments",
    "@xmath56 = @xmath85 and @xmath58 = @xmath86 , we compute the flatness factors at each of the scales @xmath61 : @xmath87 if the probability density distribution of the velocity increment is gaussian , the flatness factor is equal to 3 . if the distribution has a more pronounced tail than a gaussian distribution , the flatness factor is larger than 3 .",
    "since the transverse - velocity pattern averaged for enhancements of velocity increments is close to the profile of a burgers vortex ( sec .",
    "[ s4a ] ) , the flatness factor serves as a measure of the relative importance between vortex tubes and the background flow .",
    "the latter is a superposition of random and independent motions , for which the velocity increment is expected to follow a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the flatness factor for the transverse - velocity increment @xmath88 ( solid lines ) . at large scales ,",
    "the flatness factor is equal to the gaussian value of 3 .",
    "this is due to predominance of the background flow .",
    "as the scale is decreased from the integral length @xmath2 , the flatness factor begins to increase .",
    "this is due to increasing contribution of vortex tubes .",
    "they affect velocity increments at scales around the observed sizes @xmath54 , which could be as large as the tube lengths that are of the order of the integral length @xcite . around the taylor microscale @xmath31 ,",
    "the increase of the flatness factor becomes significant .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] also shows the flatness factor for the streamwise - velocity increment @xmath89 , which is less enhanced than that for the transverse - velocity increment @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "judging from figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] , the streamwise flatness factor reflects the energetical importance of vortex tubes as in the case of the transverse flatness factor .",
    "however , the amplitude of the @xmath5 pattern of a vortex tube tends to be less pronounced than that of the @xmath6 pattern .",
    "this is because the circulation flow @xmath43 of a vortex tube contributes to the streamwise velocity only if its axis passes at some distance from the probe , @xmath70 [ eq . ( [ eq2a ] ) ] .",
    "figure  [ f6](a ) shows the flatness factors for increments of the streamwise ( filled symbols ) and transverse ( open symbols ) velocities at the fixed scales @xmath90 ( circles ) and @xmath31 ( squares ) .",
    "the scale @xmath90 is roughly the minimum scale resolved in all the measurements . with increasing the reynolds number re@xmath3 ,",
    "the flatness factors increase .",
    "vortex tubes are increasingly predominant over the background flow at a higher reynolds number .",
    "the increase of the flatness factors is more significant at the smaller scale @xmath90 , where the background flow is less important .",
    "the increase is also more significant for the transverse - velocity increment @xcite , which is more sensitive to vortex tubes than the streamwise - velocity increment .",
    "the skewness factor for the streamwise - velocity increment @xmath91 is also studied at each of the scales @xmath61 .",
    "the definition of the skewness factor is @xmath92 this quantity characterizes the degree of asymmetry .",
    "its negative value implies that the probability density distribution has a pronounced tail extending to the negative @xmath89 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ( solid lines ) . at large scales that are more than a few times greater than the rod spacing of the grid @xmath9 , the skewness factor is equal to the gaussian value of 0 . as the scale is decreased , the skewness factor begins to decrease .",
    "this decrease reflects the energy cascade from large to small scales @xcite . around the taylor microscale @xmath31 ,",
    "the decrease becomes significant .",
    "this negative enhancement of the velocity increment is due to the strain fields associated with vortex tubes ( sec .",
    "[ s4a ] ) .",
    "we find no significant dependence of the skewness factor at a fixed scale on the reynolds number re@xmath3 .",
    "this is because our experiments do not cover a sufficiently wide re@xmath3 range .",
    "it is known that the skewness factor of the velocity derivative @xmath93 decreases slowly with increasing the reynolds number @xcite .",
    "since our conditional averaging revealed that the circulation flow of a vortex tube tends to contribute simultaneously to the streamwise and transverse velocities ( sec .",
    "[ s4a ] ) , we study the correlation between velocity increments of these two components @xcite : @xmath94 the value of @xmath95 ranges from 0 , if there is no correlation , to @xmath96 , if there is a linear correlation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ( solid lines ) . at large scales that are more than a few times greater than the rod spacing of the grid @xmath9 , the correlation is absent .",
    "as the scale is decreased , the correlation coefficient begins to increase .",
    "this is because variations of the streamwise and transverse velocities tend to be enhanced simultaneously at the position of a strong large - scale motion .",
    "the increase of the correlation coefficient becomes significant around the integral length @xmath2 and becomes still more significant around the taylor microscale @xmath31 .",
    "this is due to increasing contribution of vortex tubes .",
    "figure  [ f6](b ) shows the streamwise - transverse correlation at the fixed scales @xmath90 ( circles ) and @xmath31 ( squares ) . with increasing the reynolds number re@xmath3 ,",
    "the correlation becomes significant especially at the smaller scale @xmath90 .",
    "the streamwise ( @xmath5 ) and transverse ( @xmath6 ) velocities were measured simultaneously in isotropic grid turbulence at reynolds numbers re@xmath0330 .",
    "first , we used conditional averaging to extract typical intermittency patterns ( figs .",
    "[ f1][f3 ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath6 pattern is close to the velocity profile of a burgers vortex , the intermittency is attributable to vortex tubes .",
    "the tube radius is several times the kolmogorov length regardless of the reynolds number .",
    "since the @xmath5 pattern is not always dominated by the strain field , it was concluded that a vortex tube is not always oriented to the stretching direction .",
    "second , we used the distribution of an interval between successive enhancements of a small - scale velocity increment to study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes ( fig .",
    "it was found that vortex tubes tend to cluster together .",
    "this tendency becomes significant with the reynolds number .",
    "third , we used the flatness , skewness , and streamwise - transverse correlation of velocity increments to study the energetical contribution of vortex tubes as a function of the scale ( figs .",
    "[ f5][f8 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of vortex tubes is discernible below the integral length , which is comparable to the tube lengths , and it is significant below the taylor microscale . at a fixed scale ,",
    "the contribution becomes significant with the reynolds number .",
    "some of the above results had been reported in past studies .",
    "however , they are either numerical simulations with low reynolds numbers , re@xmath97 @xcite , laboratory experiments of isotropic turbulence with low reynolds numbers , re@xmath98 @xcite , or laboratory experiments of anisotropic turbulence @xcite .",
    "we are the first to study vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence at relatively high reynolds numbers , re@xmath0330 .",
    "since some tube parameters change as the reynolds number , experimental studies of them at the higher reynolds numbers are desirable .",
