    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) based on iii - v semiconductors doped with mn have attracted a lot of interest recently , after critical temperatures for the onset of ferromagnetism of the order of 110 k have been found in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as , for @xmath2.@xcite more recently , critical temperatures larger than room temperatures have been reported in mn - doped gan , enhancing the hope for extensive technological applications of these materials.@xcite    while there is general agreement that the magnetism is due to charge - carrier mediated , effectively ferromagnetic interactions between the mn spins , there are various theoretical models attempting to understand their detailed behavior .",
    "the dms are alloy systems , with inherent positional disorder of the mn atoms ; further , spin - orbit coupling may play a significant role for hole doping . a theoretical treatment which takes into account all these factors , and their effects on the magnetic and transport properties of dms , is not yet available . instead , theoretical models have tended to concentrate on different aspects of the problem .",
    "one class of models , where much work has been done , neglects both the disorder and spin - orbit coupling effects . at large carrier densities , where coulomb potentials of the impurity ( mn ) atoms are effectively screened out , and other disorder effects ( such as those coming from as antisite defects which are believed to be the cause of the large compensation observed experimentally ) can be neglected ,",
    "the former at least can be justified .",
    "in such a case , holes occupy a fermi sea at the top of the valence band.@xcite studies of the spin - wave spectra@xcite , monte - carlo studies@xcite as well as dynamical mean - field theory studies@xcite have been performed .",
    "overall , their results are rather similar to the physics one would expect to hold in a conventional ferromagnet .",
    "more recently , it has been proposed that spin - orbit coupling of the valence band , in the high carrier density ( strongly metallic ) regime leads to an rkky coupling between mn moments that is _ anisotropic _ in spin space , and where the positional disorder effectively leads to random anisotropy.@xcite this would lead to frustration effects on the magnetic ordering , and therefore unusual ferromagnetism .",
    "a number of very useful ab - initio studies have also been published.@xcite    in parallel , we have studied effects of positional disorder on the magnetic ordering ( in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ) of an impurity band model,@xcite developed from previous work done in the context of insulating ii - vi dms compounds.@xcite such an approach should be of relevance at low doping concentrations x , at and below the metal - insulator transition , and possibly even above .",
    "evidence for the existence of impurity - like states is provided by ab - initio studies,@xcite which found that occupied hole states near the fermi level have wave - functions mostly concentrated on and near the mn impurity .",
    "more recently , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy has revealed the existence of the impurity band in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as with @xmath3 ( very close to the metal - insulator transition).@xcite a scanning tunneling microscope study @xcite demonstrates the existence of an impurity band in ( ga , mn)as samples with x=0.005 - 0.06 .",
    "optical spectroscopy@xcite also identifies the impurity band for x=0.0001 and x=0.05 samples .",
    "electron densities in localized states , as well as states close to the mobility edge , can be far from homogeneous , unlike bloch waves . at low mn concentrations and high degree of compensation ( which comes from charged centers ) seen in dms , short length - scale density fluctuations could be significant .",
    "this can lead to inhomogeneities in the local charge densities at different mn sites , which in turn leads to ( microscopically ) inhomogeneous magnetizations of the magnetic ions in the ordered phase .",
    "such inhomogeneity would be expected to alter the nature of the collective magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) of the magnetically ordered system , which in turn would affect charge transport through the magnetic excitation processes which give rise to spin - flip scattering .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a numerical scheme to calculate the spin wave spectrum for a finite but large size model of coupled fermions and spins , in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "we show that the method accurately reproduces the results for a lattice model of small size obtained from a standard treatment of spin waves via the random phase approximation.@xcite we then apply the method to the model of ref . , and study in detail its collective magnetic excitations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the model hamiltonian for dms is described in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to developing the numerical scheme .",
    "the accuracy of the scheme is tested by comparing it with the standard rpa method in section iv .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that we can use our scheme to study large size systems , beyond the capability of the standard rpa approach .",
    "section v presents the results obtained by applying the scheme to the model of section ii , including the density of states and nature of the eigenvectors of the magnetic excitations of the coupled fermion - spin system .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section vi .",
    "in the following we develop the formalism for an impurity band hamiltonian that we believe to be appropriate for describing ( at least qualitatively ) the diluted magnetic semiconductor ga@xmath0mn@xmath4as for low doping @xmath5 ( in the insulating phase , or not too far from the metal - insulator transition ) .",
    "however , generalizations of this method for other types of hamiltonians , crystal structures , parameters etc . can be done in a straightforward manner .    the iii - v host semiconductor is assumed to have the zinc - blende structure appropriate for gaas .",
    "experimental measurements@xcite suggest that valence - ii mn substitutes for valence - iii ga . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath6 mn dopants are randomly distributed at positions @xmath7 , @xmath8 on the @xmath9 fcc ga sublattice , corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "all throughout this paper , we assume periodic boundary conditions .    due to the valence mismatch , each mn introduces a charge carrier ( hole ) in the system .",
    "however , experimentally it is found that the hole concentration is considerably suppressed through compensation processes . as a result ,",
    "the number of holes is only a fraction @xmath11 of the number of mn atoms @xmath12 .",
    "each mn atom also has a @xmath13spin @xmath14 from its half - filled @xmath15 level .",
    "the magnetic properties of the doped semiconductor are related to the exchange interaction between the mn spins and the charge carrier spins .",
    "this interaction is known to be antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , and proportional to the probability of finding the charge carrier at the corresponding mn site .",
    "recently , we proposed a simple impurity - band model to describe the behavior of the charge carriers for the low - doping regime.@xcite the main justification is that near and below the metal - insulator transition ( @xmath16 ) the density of charge carriers is not large enough to effectively screen the attractive coulomb potential of the mn dopants . as a result , bound",
    ", hydrogen - like impurity states are created about each mn site , at an energy @xmath17 ry above the top of the valence band . due to interactions ,",
    "these impurity states lead to the appearance of an impurity band , and the holes first occupy states in this band . only if the concentration of holes ( or the temperature ) is large enough , are states in the valence band itself occupied by holes .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to attempt a description of the charge carriers behavior only in terms of this impurity band .    as in previous work,@xcite in the following we will use the electron formalism to treat the problem .",
    "this is equivalent to performing a particle - hole transformation which leads to an inversion @xmath18 of the charge carrier spectrum .",
    "thus , instead of emptying the top of a valence - like impurity band ( i.e. , introducing holes in the system ) we instead occupy the bottom of a conduction - like impurity band .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption that the isolated impurity wave - function for a charge carrier trapped near the mn at site @xmath7 is the @xmath19 hydrogen orbital @xmath20 , where @xmath21   is the appropriate bohr radius related to the effective mass of the heavy hole ( @xmath22 for gaas ) and the binding energy ( @xmath23 mev for mn in gaas).@xcite our approach neglects both the complicated orbital form of the acceptor wave - function ( ref . ) and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the former is not expected to lead to any qualitative changes .",
    "it has recently been proposed that spin - orbit coupling leads to frustration in the magnetic ordering.@xcite these effects are left out in the present study , which concentrates on the effect of disorder .",
    "a study combining both effects is indicated for future work .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath24 here , @xmath25 creates a charge carrier with spin @xmath26 in the impurity state centered at site @xmath7 .",
    "the first term describes the hopping of charge carriers between impurity states .",
    "we use the parameterization @xmath27 ry , where @xmath28 , of magnitude and form appropriate for hopping between two isolated 1@xmath29 impurities which are not too close to one another .",
    "@xcite this hopping term has been shown to lead to the appearance of an impurity band which has a mobility edge , as well as a characteristic energy for the occupied states in agreement with physical expectation.@xcite    the second term of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] ) describes the afm exchange between the mn spin @xmath30 and the charge carrier spin @xmath31 [ @xmath32 are the pauli spin matrices ] .",
    "this afm exchange is proportional to the probability of finding the charge carrier trapped at @xmath33 near the mn spin at @xmath34 , and therefore @xmath35 .",
    "based on calculations of the isolated mn impurity in gaas , we estimate the exchange coupling between a hole and the trapping mn ( @xmath36 ) to be @xmath37 mev.@xcite as already stated , the number of mn atoms is @xmath6 , and therefore there are a total of @xmath38 states in the impurity band .",
    "the number of charge carriers is fixed to @xmath39 , where we take @xmath40 .    in ref .",
    "we studied the relevance of various other terms , such as an on - site potential ( associated with the coulomb potential of the compensation centers ) , hubbard - like on - site repulsion ( describing interactions between charge - carriers ) , external magnetic field etc .",
    "while they lead to various _ quantitative _ changes , we believe that the _ qualitative _ picture we present in the following sections is not changed by their absence .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) describes the collective excitations of a system about its self - consistent @xmath41 mean - field ground state . in order to clarify the notation used , we begin this section with a very short review of the derivation of the relevant equations for the mean - field ground state .",
    "we use the equation - of - motion approach of ref . .",
    "at the mean - field level , we are trying to find non - interacting fermionic quasiparticles through a unitary transformation of the on - site charge carrier operators : @xmath42 such that @xmath43 \\approx e_{n\\sigma } a^{\\dagger}_{n\\sigma}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 \\approx - \\hbar h_i s_i^{+}\\ ] ] for a non - interacting system , eqs .",

    "that the ground - state of this model , for the range of parameters we are interested in , is indeed collinear .",
    "this is why we choose to apriori make this assumption in this case .",

    "( [ 26 ] ) , ( [ 27 ] ) .",

    "diluted magnetic semiconductors exhibit ferromagnetism at low temperatures . as a result",

    "we find that this always holds true for the parameters we study in this paper .",
    "as discussed later , the spin - wave spectrum of the collective excitations also confirms that this ground - state is indeed stable .",
    "however , for higher charge carrier concentrations ( or hamiltonians with other types of interactions ) it is likely that the hf ground - state is only partially spin polarized . in that case , one must do the full iterational search for the self - consistent hf ground state .",

    "again , the curves show smooth behavior and no finite - size effects . the origin of the peak appearing near @xmath264mev will be discussed later .    before continuing the analysis",
    ", we must also point out that the goldstone modes have been left out in the dos shown in fig .",
    "the rpa system _ always _ has one solution of energy @xmath150 ( numerically , we find its magnitude to be less that @xmath265 ) , corresponding to @xmath266 .",
    "this is the goldstone mode , describing the same overall rotation of all the spins .",
    "these goldstone modes would appear in the dos as a @xmath267 function at @xmath150 ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "the effect of disorder in the positions of the mn is reflected in the considerable widening of the dos ( on a logarithmic scale ) , and rounding of the van hove singularities of the superlattice dos , as the amount of disorder increases .",
    "more significantly , however , is the _ substantial _ enhancement of the dos at _ low energies_. this behavior is in agreement with the general expectation of the effects of disorder on an energy - band dispersion .    a question of considerable interest concerns the _ nature _ of the spin - wave excitations .",
    "we know that the ordered superlattice has extended , plane - wave type spin - waves .",
    "the general expectation is that disorder will lead to localization , and thus one expects the appearance of localized spin - waves as the disorder increases .",
    "one way to characterize the nature of the spin - waves is to compute their inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , defined as : @xmath269 for an extended mode @xmath101 ( plane - wave , for instance ) , we expect that all @xmath270 coefficients are roughly of equal magnitude , since all spins are expected to participate equally in the spin - wave .",

    "as we sweep the frequencies @xmath152 of interest and compute the eigenvalues @xmath154 of the @xmath151 matrix on the grid @xmath157 , we also compute the corresponding ipr of the eigenvectors @xmath273 ( which are normalized to unity ) .",
    "the ipr is a continuous function of @xmath152 , and we use linear interpolation to find its value at the spin - wave frequencies @xmath134 of interest . whenever eigenvalues @xmath154 cross , the iprs are no longer well defined : one can choose any linear combination of the eigenvectors of the degenerate modes , which would lead to different values for the corresponding iprs .",
    "we have checked that these accidental crossings are rather rare ( below a few percent ) and equally distributed over the entire energy scale . if we exclude all these degenerate cases , we get a dos which is virtually indistinguishable from the one obtained when these modes are kept .",
    "more importantly , we find that modes which cross predominantly have the same nature ( either localized or extended ) . as a result , the ensemble averaged ipr is not sensitive to the precise treatment of these cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we plot the ( geometric ) average ipr(e ) for the moderate ( upper panel ) and strong ( lower panel ) disorder configurations .",
    "again , the goldstone modes are not shown .",
    "we use the geometric mean ( i.e. , arithmetic mean of the @xmath274 values ) in order to insure proper weight for the extended modes , with low ipr .",
    "for moderate disorder configurations , we see that the spin - wave modes at high energies @xmath275 mev are localized : the values corresponding to the three different sizes collapse on top of one another .",
    "this is expected , given the fact that the upper band - edge of the superlattice spectra is just below @xmath276 mev ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "thus , states of higher energy have been split off the band by disorder , and are expected to be localized .",
    "the low - energy part of the band also appears to be localized : while the three curves do not quite meet , the value of the ipr is just below unity , showing that these spin - waves have considerable weight on only one spin ( i.e. , they correspond to a individual spin - flip ) .",

    "the associated @xmath111 are vanishingly small at all sites except one , leading to ipr @xmath281 .",

    "the mn spins at these sites are virtually isolated , and their spin excitations are individual spin - flips .",

    "the histograms have been scaled by the total number of modes for all disorder realizations considered for each particular size . since the number of goldstone modes exactly equals the number of different realizations of disorder considered , their peaks are in a ratio of roughly 200/100/50 with respect to one another .",
    "the main observation is that the histograms for the three sizes are very similar , with a huge peak just below ipr=1 .",

    "the high - energy localized states are of very different nature : their ipr is close to @xmath285 , suggesting that it has large contributions from only two sites .",
    "analysis of the @xmath111 values for such modes shows that most of them are associated with nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "mn spins on the fcc ga sublattice .",
    "the characteristic energy for the spin - waves centered on such n.n .",
    "sites is just below 5 mev , and this is the feature responsible for the peak appearing in the dos at these energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "careful inspection of the dos reveals the appearance of smaller peaks at somewhat lower energies ( even the dos for moderate disorder has a small peak at around 2 mev , and its ipr for these modes is close to 0.5 ) .",
    "these peaks are associated with excitations of spin - pairs ( or larger clusters ) with varying separations , but they are not as well defined as the one corresponding to nearest - neighbors spins .    the small clusters of mn spins giving rise to such modes are always found to be in regions densely populated with charge carriers . due to their closeness in space , these spins are much more strongly coupled to one another than they are to other spins with which they share charge carriers .",
    "this leads to the `` resonance - like '' character of these modes : either of the spins can be flipped with equal probability . as a result of the strong - coupling , the cost of flipping either spin is high , since it frustrates their fm arrangement .",
    "indeed , the characteristic energy of roughly @xmath286 reflects much stronger coupling than the average one present in the superlattice case .",
    "the histogram of the ipr of all modes of energy @xmath284 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] confirms all these conclusions .",
    "we caution that these energies may be substantially modified due to direct antiferromagnetic mn - mn exchange ( left out in our model ) in real systems .",

    "it is rather difficult to establish exactly the `` mobility edge '' corresponding to the transitions from localized to extended modes at either end , given the rather small system sizes considered here .",
    "thus , we use the values quoted above only as plausible estimates of these boundaries . clearly , for these energies the average ipr decreases with increasing @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plot the histograms of the ipr for all the modes with energy @xmath290 . in this case ,",
    "size dependence is clearly visible , both in the position of the broad peak maximum as well as in the lower cut - off in ipr value .",
    "the position of the maxima scale roughly like @xmath291 .",
    "we have attempted both gaussian and lorentzian fits , but neither seems to capture the low - ipr tail properly . in the smaller samples , a second peak appears just below ipr=1 . at first sight , this might seem to indicate the existence of a finite density of localized states at these energies as well . however , we believe that this peak is a finite - size effect",
    ". clearly , its amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath6 and would vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is very different from the behavior observed in either of the two localized energy ranges , where the distributions for all sizes are virtually identical ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the appearance of this second peak is simply the restriction ipr @xmath292 1 . as the broad peak moves towards higher values with decreasing @xmath6 ,",
    "all the values in the upper tail `` bunch '' at ipr=1 .",
    "one final important observation relates to the absolute values of the iprs in the extended spin - wave regime . although scaling with system size is present , the corresponding ipr values are much higher than the ones expected for modes extended over _ all _ mn sites ( these values are shown by the positions of the goldstone modes in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , and are well below the cut - offs observed in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this means that in the disordered system , the extended spin - waves are delocalized only over a fraction of the total number of sites . as the amount of disorder increases , this fraction decreases , since ipr averages for the moderate disorder are smaller than ipr averages for full disorder .",
    "these results are consistent with the picture provided by the temperature dependent mean - field study of this model ( ref . ) .",
    "there , we concluded that in the disordered system , the ( small fraction @xmath195 ) of charge carriers are concentrated in a small volume of the sample , where the local mn concentration is larger than average . as a result ,",
    "the concentration of charge carriers is strongly enhanced in these regions , and the exchange with the mn spins inside these regions ( which is proportional to the probability of finding charge carriers nearby ) is greatly increased , preserving magnetization of these regions up to high temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the mn spins in the regions devoid of charge carriers are very weakly coupled , and behave as free spins down to very low temperatures .",
    "due to the very inhomogeneous assembly of weakly- and strongly- interacting spins , the magnetization curves have very unusual , concave shapes .",
    "the present study of the spin - waves corroborates the same picture .",
    "we find very low - energy , spin - flip like excitations , which are obviously due to the weakly interacting spins , and which are responsible for a very sharp decrease of the magnetization at exponentially small temperatures.@xcite this is is to be contrasted with the behavior of ordered conventional ferromagnets , where at low temperatures only low - energy long - wavelength spin - waves can be excited .",
    "since their phase space is vanishing in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath293 in @xmath294 dimensions ) , the magnetization of conventional ferromagnets decreases very slowly from its saturation value with increasing temperature , leading to convex upwards magnetization curves.@xcite    in our model , the extended spin - waves are concentrated around the high - density mn regions , where the charge carriers mediating the interactions are to be found .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of modes whose ipr , while scaling with the system size , shows modes extended only over a fraction of all system sites .",
    "as the amount of disorder decreases all the way to a fully ordered superlattice , the charge carriers are more and more homogeneously spread throughout the sample and the ipr of the extended modes has lower and lower values , as observed from fig .",
    "however , the more homogeneous a sample is , the less the average afm coupling between the mn spins and the charge carriers , since the charge carriers have now equal probability of being found anywhere in the sample , instead of being concentrated in a small fraction of the space .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the critical temperature @xmath295 , as observed in both mean - field @xcite and monte - carlo@xcite analysis .",
    "the enhancement of the mean - field @xmath295 with increasing disorder is suggested also by the existence of the high - energy localized modes , which show that ferromagnetic alignment will persist in high - density clusters up to very high temperatures .",
    "it also suggests that local ferromagnetic fluctuations might be observed well above @xmath295 .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we demonstrate the accuracy and speed of a new scheme for computing rpa spectra , which allows tackling of systems of much larger sizes than the ones that can be analyzed with the standard rpa formulation .",
    "investigation of large system sizes and averages over many disorder realizations facilitate a clear picture for the problem we are interested in , namely the spectrum and nature of spin - waves of a disordered dms .",
    "we then demonstrate that disorder can significantly change the spectrum and the nature of the spin - waves .",
    "this is likely to lead to important consequences not only as far as magnetic properties are concerned ( we have already commented on the fast de - magnetization with increasing temperature , due to low - energy spin - flip modes ) .",
    "more importantly , this may have significant consequences for transport properties as well .",
    "for instance , charge carrier spin scattering is likely to be very different in various regions of the sample .",
    "large anomalous hall effect has been observed in ( ga , mn)as,@xcite but the theory used to interpret it is borrowed from phenomenology relevant to homogeneous ferromagnetic metals . in an inhomogeneous system",
    ", some of the accepted ideas might have to be modified or at least verified to still hold true .",
