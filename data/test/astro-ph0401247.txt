    "accelerating a thermonuclear flame to a large fraction of the speed of sound ( possibly supersonic ) is one of the main difficulties in modeling type  ia supernovae ( see the recent review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical results have shown that a prompt detonation does not yield the right abundance pattern to account for the observations @xcite ; consequently , the burning must begin as a subsonic flame .",
    "one dimensional simulations show that the flame needs to reach approximately one third of the speed of sound to properly account for the explosion energetics and nucleosynthetic yields @xcite , although , a transition from a deflagration to a detonation at some late stage of the explosion @xcite is not ruled out .",
    "laminar flame speeds are too slow by several orders of magnitude @xcite , so instabilities and the interaction with flame - generated turbulence are turned to in hopes of providing a mechanism to considerably accelerate the flame .    in this paper , we focus on the effects of the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite on the flame . after ignition , the subsonic flame moves outward from the center of the star .",
    "the pressure is essentially continuous across the flame .",
    "furthermore , since the star has time to expand in response to the burning , this pressure also remains constant in time .",
    "as the flame propagates , it leaves behind hot ash that is less dense than the cool fuel .",
    "gravity points toward the center of the star , so this flame front is rt unstable",
    ". bubbles of hot ash will rise and try to exchange places with spikes of cool fuel , increasing the surface area of the flame and leading to an enhancement of the flame speed .",
    "it is possible that this acceleration , operating on the stellar scale , can bring the flame speed up to a significant fraction of the speed of sound .",
    "furthermore , the shear layer between the fuel and ash which develops as the instability evolves is kelvin - helmholtz unstable , creating turbulence in the region of the flame .",
    "as the flame surface is wrinkled by the rt instability , it will interact with this turbulence .",
    "we look in detail at the interaction between the rt instability and the flame on small scales through 2-dimensional spatially resolved simulations in conditions appropriate to the late stages of a type  ia supernova explosion .",
    "the difference in scale between the white dwarf and the flame width is enormous ( up to 12 orders of magnitude ) , making direct numerical simulations of the whole explosion process impossible .",
    "nevertheless , simulations of rt unstable flames have been attempted for some time , both on the full stellar scale and as smaller , constant density micro - physical studies .",
    "various techniques and approximations are used to follow an unresolved flame on these scales . some of the earliest such calculations @xcite used donor - cell advection to follow a combustion front through the star , burning most of it , and releasing enough energy to produce an explosion . in their model ,",
    "the flame was propagated essentially through numerical diffusion .",
    "the rt instability was resolved only on the very largest scales of the star , missing the turbulence generated on the small scales .",
    "@xcite used a two - dimensional implicit lagrangian - remap hydrodynamics code with a mixing - length subgrid model to follow a rt unstable flame .",
    "the diffusion of reactants in the lagrangian - remap scheme is much lower than that used in @xcite , so a more physical flame speed could be used .",
    "the flame speed was chosen to be either the conductive ( laminar ) or turbulent speed  which ever was larger .",
    "again , the whole star was modeled , with coarse resolution , showing that the rt instability sets up and greatly convolutes the flame front , but the resulting acceleration left the flame too slow to match observations .",
    "@xcite suggested that more resolution is needed to get the small scale physics right .",
    "the effects of turbulence on the burning were investigated by @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional , small scale rt simulations using a thickened - flame model , coupled to an explicit lagrange - remap ppm @xcite implementation to model a thin flame front were performed by @xcite and later extended to 3-d @xcite . in this model , a reaction - diffusion equation for the fuel concentration is solved along with the euler equations , with the conductivity and reaction rate modified to yield the desired laminar flame speed and a flame that was a few computational zones wide .",
    "the thermal structure of the true flame is stretched greatly , and , as a result , curvature effects of the flame are not properly included .",
    "energy is deposited behind the flame to couple this reaction - diffusion model to the hydrodynamics .",
    "similar techniques have also been used for terrestrial flames ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "simulations of the rt instability at a density of @xmath1 lead the author to conclude that while the flame accelerates , it is too small of an acceleration ( when scaled up to the size of the star ) to account for the observations , and that a deflagration - detonation transition may be more promising . owing to the difference in behavior between two - dimensional and three - dimensional turbulence , @xcite concludes that the turbulence was more effective in increasing the flame speed in 3-d",
    ". @xcite demonstrated scaling relations for the 3-d rt unstable flame and concluded that the turbulent flame speed does not depend on the small scale burning or the laminar flame speed .",
    "the independence of the turbulent flame speed on the laminar speed was also postulated by @xcite , who performed a full - stellar model based on kolmogorov scaling of turbulence from the large stellar scales down to the flame scales . here , a turbulent scaling model using the gibson length ( the scale at which an eddy is completely burned during a single turnover ) as the small scale cutoff yields a turbulent flame velocity prediction for the grid scale .",
    "this was coupled with a subgrid model for the turbulent kinetic energy , and implemented within the ppm algorithm .",
    "their simulations of the flame propagating through the whole star showed the rt instability dominating the flow , but the flame did not accelerate enough to produce an explosion .",
    "more recently , large scale simulations of pure deflagration explosion have been performed using two different methods , level - sets @xcite and a thickened - flame model @xcite with a sharp - wheeler @xcite rt subgrid model . both groups using ppm as their underlying explicit hydrodynamics method .",
    "different numbers and locations of the ignition points are used , but the 3-d simulations by both groups release enough energy to explode the star , with the burning proceeding solely as a deflagration .",
    "these studies have demonstrated the tremendous effect the rt instability has as the dominant acceleration mechanism of the flame  to the point where , in some simulations , a deflagration alone can unbind the star .",
    "however , in all the cases discussed above , some model for the flame or turbulence on scales smaller than the grid resolution was required . in this paper",
    ", we present fully resolved simulations of rt unstable flames at the densities appropriate to the late stages of the explosion  no flame model is used . fully resolving",
    "the flame means that the effects of curvature and strain on the flame are implicitly accounted for .",
    "curvature effects on flames in conditions close to those studied here were found to be important in @xcite , where laminar flames were propagated in diverging and converging spherical geometries . here , the effects can be even larger as the flame will experience sharp kinks as it is distorted by the rt instability . to achieve converged steady - state laminar flames , approximately five grid point resolution in the thermal width",
    "is required .",
    "this limits the size of the domain that can be modeled significantly ( although the adaptive mesh refinement employed here helps greatly ) , but frees us from the need to deal with subgrid models .",
    "resolved simulations at the smallest scales complement the full star flame - model calculations , and it is hoped that progress from the small scales up will allow us in the future to develop and calibrate more accurate subgrid models .    fully resolved multidimensional type  ia - like flame simulations are rare @xcite , mainly because the flame moves so slowly , requiring excessive numbers of timesteps for compressible codes .",
    "resolved calculations of the reactive rt instability have been performed before @xcite , but using model flames ( a kpp - type reaction , @xcite ) and a boussinesq approximation , under conditions that are not directly applicable to type  ia sne . when extrapolated to the astrophysical regime",
    ", they predict a flame speed independent of the laminar speed , similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "however , compressibility was neglected in these calculations .",
    "here we use a low mach number formulation of the equations of motion , which retains the compressibility , but frees us from the restrictive acoustic timestep constraint , and we use realistic input physics ( reaction rate , eos , etc . )",
    "appropriate to the conditions in a type  ia sne explosion .",
    "flame instabilities stretch and wrinkle the flame , increasing the bulk burning rate .",
    "the sne flame is subject to the landau - darrieus @xcite and rt instabilities , as well as the interaction with turbulence . in a previous paper , ( @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper  i ) , we looked at landau - darrieus unstable flames , and validated the low mach number method for astrophysical flames , confirming the results of earlier studies that the acceleration of the laminar flame is quite small , while finding no evidence for the breakdown of the cusps in the non - linear regime . in the present paper , we look in detail at the interaction between the burning and the rt instability .",
    "a rt driven flame behaves very differently from its laminar counterpart . aside from looking at the increase in velocity over the laminar speed the wrinkling provides , we seek to determine whether there is a simple scaling relation that matches these results , and whether such a relation holds over the whole range of densities , where the character of the burning is expected to change dramatically .",
    "in  [ sec : distributedburning ] , we discuss the effects of the burning on the rt instability when we enter the distributed burning regime . in  [ sec : numerics ] , the low mach number numerical method and input physics are described , followed by the results of our simulations in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : detonation ] by discussing the implications of the rt burning process on the explosion mechanism for type  ia sne .",
    "the rt instability has been well studied analytically @xcite and numerically , both as an incompressible ( see recent results by @xcite ) and compressible ( see for example @xcite ) fluid . in the absence of burning ,",
    "the growth of the multimode rt instability in the non - linear regime is characterized by two parameters , one describing the terminal velocity , and the other describing bubble merger @xcite .",
    "bubbles are assumed to merge when the difference in their heights exceeds some critical multiple of the smaller bubbles size .",
    "this leads to an expression for the average position of the interface , @xmath2 @xcite where @xmath3 is a function of the two parameters , and @xmath4  is the atwood number .",
    "much theoretical , computational , and experimental work aims to measure @xmath3 , and some evidence suggests that it may be constant for a wide range of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the merged bubbles can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these expressions were all formulated for the non - reactive rt instability and studies of rising bubbles .",
    "numerical experiments of reactive rt instabilities in sne conditions @xcite using a thickened - flame model found agreement with the above velocity expression , with @xmath7 .",
    "expressions of this form have been used as a subgrid model for the flame speed in full - star , pure deflagration calculations of type  ia explosions in 1-d @xcite and 3-d @xcite , resulting in a successful explosion of the star .",
    "these results suggest that the rt instability is the dominant acceleration mechanism for the flame .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that , unlike a non - reactive rt instability , where all wavelengths can grow ( in the absence of surface tension ) , burning introduces a small scale cutoff to the instability .",
    "the growth rate for the pure rt instability is determined by the dispersion relation @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the angular frequency and @xmath10 is the horizontal wave number for the dominant mode .",
    "we note that we have ignored contributions due to surface tension . by equating the period for the growth of the instability to the laminar flame propagation timescale",
    ", @xcite showed that there is a critical wavelength below which any perturbations will be washed out by burning .",
    "this wavelength is called the fire - polishing wavelength , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the effective gravitational acceleration .",
    "we note that this is a simple estimate , nevertheless , it provides a useful measure of the effectiveness of the rt instability on disrupting the flame .",
    "table  [ table : flameproperties ] lists the flame properties , as computed by the code described in ",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , including @xmath11 for the densities we are considering .",
    "stratification effects are negligible on the scales that we are considering , since we are modeling a tiny fraction of the star .",
    "the relative change in pressure over our domain is @xmath14 where we have expressed this ratio in terms of the mach number of the sharp - wheeler velocity for a rt flame encompassing our entire domain .",
    "since we are resolving the structure of the flame , the domain size restrictions limit the speed - ups we see to about 10  times the laminar speed , which gives a maximum @xmath15 of @xmath16 .    as the density of the white dwarf decreases , the flame speed decreases sharply while the flame width , @xmath17 , increases .",
    "as table  [ table : flameproperties ] shows , at the densities we are considering , we pass from the regime where @xmath18 ( low densities ) to @xmath19 ( high densities ) .",
    "when @xmath18 , the rt instability will dominate the flame , to the point where it may no longer be continuous , and one can no longer draw a simple curve from one side of the domain to the other marking the flame position .",
    "this increase in complexity of the flame surface signifies that we are leaving the flamelet regime .",
    "@xcite made estimates of the density where the burning transitions from the flamelet regime to the distributed burning regime , in which a distinguished local flame surface is not apparent . using the flame properties",
    "tabulated in @xcite and equating the gibson scale to the flame width , they found that for a 0.5  @xmath20c/0.5  @xmath21o flame , the burning will enter the distributed burning regime at a density of @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite refined this estimate by suggesting that since the turbulence present in a type  ia explosion is generated by the rt instability , it should follow bolgiano - obukhov rather than kolmogorov statistics .",
    "they found a slightly lower transition density of @xmath24 . at these densities ,",
    "the turbulence is intense enough to disrupt the flame .",
    "we note that this transition density is right in the range where the fire polishing length becomes equal to the flame width , as discussed above .",
    "this density range is also interesting in the context of deflagration to detonation transitions ( ddt ) .",
    "arguments based on nucleosynthesis and one - dimensional modeling suggest that if the burning in a type  ia supernova were to transition from a deflagration to a detonation , this transition would need to occur at a density around @xmath0 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation between this ddt density and the density marking the transition to the distributed burning regime was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional turbulence studies of the flame - turbulence interaction at these densities were performed by @xcite , where it was observed that the turbulence disrupts the flame sufficiently in some cases to create local explosions as the hot ash comes in contact with pockets of cool fuel .",
    "if these regions of fuel are large enough , these local explosions may be able to initiate a ddt .",
    "direct numerical simulations of thermonuclear flames at these densities do not exist .",
    "@xcite performed simplified flame model calculations in 3-d using a source term relevant to flames in type  ia supernovae .",
    "they concluded that for densities larger than @xmath24 , scaling the flame speed in direct proportion to the increase in surface area is a valid subgrid model . for densities below @xmath0",
    "however , they state that the effects of turbulence become important .",
    "as table  [ table : flameproperties ] shows , the laminar flame speed in our density range is extremely subsonic  our highest laminar flame mach number is @xmath25 . simulating a flame at these densities with a fully compressible code would be prohibitively expensive , requiring millions of timesteps .",
    "this in turn leads to a large accumulation of error .",
    "instead , a low mach number hydrodynamics code @xcite is employed for the present study .",
    "we discuss the numerical method in  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "together , the flame width and the fire - polishing length set strict limits on the densities and size of domains that can be addressed through fully resolved simulations .",
    "steady state laminar flame simulations show that we need about 510 zones inside the flames thermal width , @xmath26 we note that this width measurement is a factor of 23 narrower than the alternate measure defined as the width of the region where the temperature is 10% above the fuel temperature to 90% of the ash temperature that was used in @xcite . in order",
    "for the rt instability to develop , we need the computational domain to be at least one fire - polishing length wide , but in practice , we want 10 or more fire - polishing lengths in the domain for bubble merger to take place and the rt instability to become well developed .",
    "these restrictions limit us to consider densities @xmath27 in the present study",
    ". the lower limit of densities we can consider is set only by what is attained in the supernova explosion itself  we stop at @xmath28 here .",
    "when the rt instability dominates the burning , it is the fluid motion mixing the fuel with the hot ash that controls the burning of the new fuel , rather than thermal conduction .",
    "thus , the flame has a very large thermal width , governed by the mixing , at the lowest densities . to initiate a detonation ,",
    "the temperature in a sufficiently large region needs to rise in unison , such that the over - pressure generated by the burning is strong enough to drive a shock just ahead of the burning layer .",
    "the critical size of this region is called the matchhead size .",
    "if this rt thermal width becomes as large as the critical detonation matchhead size , as tabulated in @xcite , it is possible that a ddt can occur .",
    "furthermore , the size of the matchhead increases dramatically as the density decreases , and at low densities , it may be larger than the entire star .",
    "we note that recent simulations @xcite indicate that a pure deflagration can be successful in unbinding the star .",
    "we will explore the possible of a ddt , using the scaling behavior we find for flames in the distributed burning regime .",
    "the simulations were performed using an adaptive , low mach number hydrodynamics code , as described in @xcite .",
    "the state variables in the inviscid navier - stokes equations are expanded in powers of mach number , following @xcite .",
    "the result is that the pressure is decomposed into a dynamic and thermodynamic component , the ratio of which is of order mach number squared .",
    "only the dynamic component appears in the momentum equation .",
    "these equations are solved using an approximate projection formalism @xcite , breaking the time evolution into an advection and a projection step .",
    "the advection is computed using an unsplit , second - order godunov method that updates the species and enthalpy to the new time level and finds provisional velocities .",
    "a divergence constraint on the velocities is provided by the thermodynamics , and enforced in the projection step , where the provisional velocities are projected onto the space of vectors satisfying this constraint .",
    "burning is handled through operator splitting .",
    "the low mach number formulation allows us to follow the evolution of these slow moving flames  in this density range , the laminar speeds are @xmath29without the constraint of the sound speed on the timestep .",
    "this affords us timesteps that are @xmath30 larger than a fully compressible code would take .",
    "we are still free however to have large density jumps as we cross the flame .",
    "this method was validated for astrophysical applications by comparing solutions of 1-d laminar flames to fully compressible results @xcite , and in our study of the landau - darrieus instability ( paper  i ) , where the growth rate computed from our calculations matched the theoretical predictions across a range of wave numbers .",
    "the code is unchanged from the description in @xcite .",
    "we review the input physics used in the present simulations below .",
    "this method contrasts sharply with that used in the only previous study of the rt instability in type  ia sne , as presented in @xcite .",
    "there , the fully compressible ppm algorithm was used , along with a model for a thickened flame to represent it on the small scales .",
    "the laminar flame speed matched the correct physical value , but the flame thickness was much larger than the physical value . in the present case ,",
    "resolving the thermal structure frees us from the need for a flame model .",
    "the equation of state consists of a helmholtz free - energy tabular component for the degenerate / relativistic electrons / positrons , an ideal gas component for the ions , and a blackbody component for radiation , as described in @xcite .",
    "the conductivities contain contributions from electron - electron and electron - ion processes , and are described in @xcite .",
    "all of the flames are half carbon / half oxygen , but only the carbon is burned . a single reaction , @xmath20c(@xmath20c,@xmath31)@xmath32 mg , is followed , using the unscreened rate from @xcite .",
    "since we do not expect the burning to proceed up to the iron - group elements at these low densities , this reaction alone is sufficient to model the nuclear reactions .",
    "the reaction rate for oxygen burning is several orders of magnitude slower than the carbon rate at the ash temperatures we reach , so neglecting oxygen burning is valid on our scales .",
    "the calculations are initiated by mapping a one - dimensional steady state laminar flame ( computed with the same code ) onto our grid , shifting the zero point according to a random phase , 10 frequency sinusoidal perturbation . beginning with a steady - state flame in pressure equilibrium",
    "virtually eliminates any transients from disturbing the flow ahead of the flame . in all of the results presented ,",
    "the flame is moving downward in our domain .",
    "the transverse boundaries are periodic , the upper boundary is outflow , and the lower boundary is inflow , with the inflow velocity set to the laminar flame speed .",
    "this keeps an unperturbed flame stationary on our grid .",
    "the solutions presented here were computed with an advective cfl number of  @xmath33 and typically required 8000  timesteps .",
    "for all the runs we present , adaptive mesh refinement was used , with a base grid plus one finer level that has twice the resolution .",
    "this allows us to focus the resolution on the interesting parts of the flow , allowing larger domains to be studied .",
    "refinement triggered on the temperature gradient and the gradient of carbon mass fraction , ensuring that the flame s reaction zone was always at the finest resolution .",
    "table  [ table : simparams ] lists the parameters used for all the simulations we present . for the lowest density case , @xmath34",
    ", we actually present results for three different domain sizes and two resolutions and for the @xmath0 case , we present an additional simulation with the burning disabled . except where noted otherwise , all discussion of the @xmath28 results refer to the widest domain run . in the discussion below",
    ", we first concentrate on the change in character of the burning as the density is changed .",
    "next we look at integral quantities that help characterize the flame , followed by a measurement of the rt growth rate and a comparison of the rt instability with and without burning .",
    "finally , we consider resolution and domain size effects on the results we present .      figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_wide ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7 ] show the results for the three densities we consider in this paper , @xmath34 , @xmath0 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the fuel is at the bottom of the domain ( and colored red ) , and the ash is at the top of the domain .",
    "gravity points up , toward increasing  @xmath36 , in all simulations .",
    "for all runs , we set @xmath37 .",
    "this value is appropriate for the outer regions of the star , and assumes that some pre - expansion of the white dwarf has taken place .",
    "the domain width was chosen based on the flame width and fire - polishing length ( and considerations of how many zones we can reasonably compute ) to contain several unstable wavelengths .",
    "we see from the figures that as the density increases , the small scale structure is greatly diminished , as the burning is more effective in containing it .",
    "the calculations were run until the instability reached the top or bottom of the computational domain , or the size of the mixed region grew to be much larger than the width of the domain , leading to saturation of the instability which will be discussed later . in the descriptions below ,",
    "` bubble ' refers to the hot ash buoyantly rising into the cool fuel , and ` spike ' refers to the cool fuel falling into the hot ash .",
    "the results for @xmath38 , 768  cm wide simulation ( figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_wide ] ) shows the flow quickly becoming mixed and the initial perturbations rapidly forgotten .",
    "a mixed region 5001000  cm wide forms , separating the fuel and ash .",
    "some smaller features begin to burn away as the flame evolves and the ash gets entrained by the fluid motions . at late times",
    ", it becomes impossible to draw a well defined flame surface separating the fuel and ash , as the rt mixing clearly dominates . in ",
    "[ sec : res ] , we look at the effect of different domain widths on this growth .",
    "the @xmath0 run ( figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7 ] ) shows a balance between the rt growth and the burning",
    ". spikes of fuel push well into the hot ash , forming well defined mushroom caps .",
    "before these caps can travel too far into the ash , they burn away .",
    "this is seen for several spikes in figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7]the mushrooms gradually burn away , almost uniformly , turning yellow / green , and finally leaving a ephemeral outline in the ash as the burning completes . as the instability evolves ,",
    "we see longer wavelength modes beginning to dominate , but they also begin to burn away .",
    "we are prevented from watching the final dominant mode that grows burn away because of it reaching the top of our domain .    the highest density case",
    ", @xmath35 ( figure  [ fig : rt_1.5e7 ] ) behaves qualitatively different than the two lower densities .",
    "a defining characteristic of this density is that the flame front is always sharply defined  a trait that we expect to carry over to higher densities as well . at this density ,",
    "the burning proceeds rapidly enough that it can suppress the rt instability significantly .",
    "this is as expected , since the fire - polishing length is larger than the flame width at this density ( see table  [ table : flameproperties ] ) . as the spikes of fuel extend into the hot ash , we see them rapidly burning away from the outside inward .",
    "the rt mushroom caps hardly have time to form before their ends are burned away , giving them a hammerhead - like appearance .",
    "figure  [ fig : carbon_destruction ] shows the carbon destruction rate , @xmath39 , at the midpoint of each calculation for the three densities . at the low density end",
    ", the burning is concentrated in small regions whereas at the high end , the burning is smoother .",
    "we would expect this trend to continue for densities outside the range we consider here . at higher densities",
    ", the burning will dominate even more , and we would expect the flame surface to be well defined on the small scales . at densities lower than @xmath28 , the mixed region will grow even larger , as the burning becomes even less effective at suppressing the rt instability .",
    "we will look at how the width of the reactive region grows in proportion to that of the mixed region at these low densities in  [ sec : growth ] .",
    "having described the overall evolution of the flames , we now present some quantitative measures of flame behavior .",
    "we define the effective flame speed , @xmath40 , in terms of the carbon consumption in the domain ; namely , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spatial domain of the burning region , @xmath43 is the width of inflow face , @xmath44 is the inflow carbon mass fraction , and @xmath45 is the rate of consumption of carbon due to nuclear burning .",
    "accurate direct evaluation of this integral is problematic because of the operator split treatment of reactions in the numerical method .",
    "a robust and accurate estimate of @xmath40 can be obtain by integrating the conservation equation for carbon mass fraction @xmath46 over @xmath42 and a time interval @xmath47 $ ] to obtain @xmath48 @xmath49 is the inflow velocity .",
    "note that this formula is only valid when essentially all carbon is being consumed in the domain .",
    "another quantity of interest is the area of the flame , which for our two - dimensional studies is a length .",
    "computing a flame length for the lower density cases is problematic since there is often not a distinct flame surface . in this paper",
    "we define a flame length as the number of zone edges where the carbon mass fraction passes through  0.25 .",
    "we normalize the length to the initial flame length so we can measure the growth of the burning surface .",
    "this approach , while crude , is robust and defines a reasonable method for computing the length of a well mixed flame where other approaches are infeasible .",
    "in particular , this approach systematically overestimates the flame length ; however , this can be compensated for by normalizing by the initial flame length .",
    "we have validated that for well - defined flames , this method agrees well with the length of a contour as computed with the commercial idl package , after normalization .",
    "figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_speeds ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_length ] show the speeds and lengths of the flames at the three densities as a function of time ( the additional curves on the @xmath28 plots will be discussed in  [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "the maximum speedups we observe are 3  times the laminar speed for the @xmath28 run , 5  times for the @xmath0 run , and 2.5  times for the @xmath50 run .",
    "these speedups are much larger than any seen in our companion study on the landau - darrieus instability ( paper  i ) , as expected , based on the outcome of the large scale simulations of the explosion .",
    "the flame length increases by a factor of 50 throughout the simulation for the two lowest densities , but only increases to by a factor of 8 for the @xmath35 case , due to the strong moderation of the rt instability by the burning .    comparing the velocity curves to the length curves",
    ", we see that , in general , the velocity is not strictly proportional to the flame surface area .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the stretch and curvature that the flame experiences as well as the complicated motions of the rt instability pushing the fuel and ash together will modify the local burning rate .",
    "evidence of this variability is seen in figure  [ fig : carbon_destruction ] where considerable variation in the carbon destruction rate is observed , even for the highest density case . to further quantify this effect , in figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_v_vs_a ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_v_vs_a ] we plot the velocity divided by flame surface area normalized to @xmath51 , where @xmath43 is the width of the box . with the caveat that there are ambiguities in defining flame surface area for",
    "the `` distributed '' flames , we observe that , after an initial transient , the flame speed versus area relaxes to an essentially statistically stationary value . for the highest density case ,",
    "the effective flame velocity is approximately 30% of the laminar flame speed @xmath52 the area enhancement . for the lower density cases , the value drops to approximately 10% .",
    "thus , at these densities , we find @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a proportionality constant not equal to 1 .",
    "this proportionality constant increases with density , reflecting the fact that the fire - polishing wavelength , which sets the smallest scale on which we can wrinkle the flame , grows as well .",
    "thus at higher densities , the localized curvature is smaller , and as a result , the localized velocity is less affected .",
    "this has strong implications for subgrid models , particularly in the flamelet regime , where it is normally assumed that the velocity scales directly as the increase in area of the flame surface .",
    "it appears that this is not the case , and is further complicated by the density dependence of the proportionality constant .",
    "@xcite introduced a fractal model to describe the growth of the flame surface in a supernova when the burning is in the flamelet regime .",
    "the self - similar range through which a fractal description applies is bounded by the fire - polishing length on the small scales and the sharp - wheeler description for the rt instability growth on the large scales . in two - dimensions , a fractal model for the growth of the flame surface would be @xmath55 where we expect @xmath56 in the self - similar scaling regime .",
    "the offset in time , @xmath57 , is chosen such that @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is taken to be @xmath60 . as we will see in ",
    "[ sec : growth ] , the sharp - wheeler model may not be the proper description of the reactive rt instability . with that caveat , figures  [ fig : rt_1.e7_length ] and [ fig : rt_1.5e7_length ]",
    ", we plot the predictions of the fractal scaling model using @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which give area growing as @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . from these figures",
    ", it seems that , if this fractal model is correct , the growth in the flame surface is closely represented by a fractal dimension of 1.7 .",
    "this agrees with the value computed from two - dimensional rt studies by @xcite .",
    "some evidence suggests that the fractal dimension of rt induced turbulence may increase with time @xcite .",
    "we caution however that we only span about a decade between @xmath65 and @xmath66 in these simulations .",
    "if such a scaling holds , it could serve as a subgrid model for large scale simulations , however , the evolution of the proportionality constant in equation  ( [ eq : v_vs_a ] ) needs to be understood .",
    "additional calculations that encompass a larger range of spatial scales are needed to further validate this model .",
    "not all of the energy release by the flame goes into driving the expansion of the star .",
    "the rt unstable flame and associated kelvin - helmholtz instabilities also generate turbulence .",
    "turbulence diagnostics can be difficult to define  here we use an integral quantity , the favre average turbulent kinetic energy which plays a role in the @xmath67 subgrid model for turbulence .",
    "the favre average turbulent kinetic energy ( for a discussion of which see @xcite ) , can be written @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the horizontal spatial average of the quantity enclosed in the brackets . figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke_y ] shows @xmath70 as a function of height at several instances in time for the @xmath28 flame .",
    "we see that , within the mixed region , the turbulent kinetic energy is roughly constant , and this plateau rises quadratically with time , as shown in figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke_peak ] .",
    "the integral of  @xmath71 over the vertical extent of the domain is the total turbulent kinetic energy  @xmath72 .",
    "the generation of turbulent kinetic energy as a function of time is shown for the three densities in figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_tke ] .",
    "the data suggest that the increase in kinetic energy as a function of time is well approximated by a power law of the form @xmath73 are shown in figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_tke ] , and summarized in table  [ table : tke ] .",
    "the power law fits , summarized in table  [ table : tke ] match the data quite well , giving an exponent , @xmath74@xmath75 , depending on the density , with the power increasing with increasing density . in the lowest density run",
    ", there is considerable turbulent energy , and , as figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke_y ] shows , @xmath76 is reached after @xmath77  s. this is on a scale of @xmath78  cm .",
    "@xcite presumed pre - existing turbulent kinetic energy of this level on scales of @xmath79  cm in their main calculation . assuming a one - third power scaling of the energy cascade , on their length scales the rt generate turbulence already overwhelms this pre - existing turbulence , and it is continuing to grow , apparently quadratically with time .",
    "these results suggest that the rt instability alone can provide the turbulent motions presumed to exist in the star .      in the absence of any reactions",
    ", the extent of the mixed region should increase as @xmath80 , as predicted by the sharp - wheeler model , equation  ( [ eq : sw ] ) .",
    "this relation is only expected to hold during the phase where bubbles are merging , which excludes the initial linear growth range .",
    "also , because we are resolving the flame structure , the interface between the fuel and ash is not infinitesimally thin , which complicates the definition of the atwood number .",
    "furthermore , at late times , once the bubble merging in our domain has stopped and the size of the mixed region rivals the width of the domain , this relation will also break down .",
    "this relation was derived for the purely hydrodynamical rt instability .",
    "burning can have large consequences here .",
    "the sharp - wheeler model describes the growth of this mixed region , which will contain fuel and ash , but that fuel is burning , and as it turns into ash , we would expect to find the mixed region smaller than that of the purely hydrodynamical case .",
    "for the present simulations , since we have a limited number of modes in our box ( typically 10 ) , we are only going to be able to do the fits on a small subset of the data .",
    "a future study will focus on scaling in the flamelet regime , using much larger domains .",
    "figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_width ] to  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_width ] show the extrema of the mixed region , computed by laterally averaging the carbon mass fractions and finding the positions where it first exceeds  0.05 and  0.45 .",
    "this definition is consistent with that used in @xcite .",
    "the curves are measured with respect to the initial position of the interface .",
    "the top curve measures the position the spikes of fuel pushing into the region of hot ash .",
    "the lower curve is the position of the bubbles of hot ash floating into the fuel .",
    "the sharp kinks in the spike curves represent the instances where the plume of fuel , having pushed far into the ash region , burned away . at the highest density ( figure  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_width ] ) ,",
    "the bubble curve is very smooth .",
    "we can make fits of the growth of the mixed region to time by fitting to a power law , @xmath81 we do not attempt to fit to the sharp - wheeler scaling and find a value of @xmath3 because of the limited range of wavelengths we follow , and the uncertainty as to whether that relation holds in the reactive case .",
    "we exclude the initial linear phase of the growth of the rt instability in our fits .",
    "figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_width_fit ] to [ fig : rt_1.5e7_width_fit ] shows the results . in all cases , we find @xmath82 less than 2.0 , indicating that we are not in the sharp - wheeler regime . furthermore , @xmath82 increases with increasing density .",
    "we find @xmath83 for @xmath28 , @xmath84 for @xmath0 , and @xmath85 for @xmath35 .",
    "larger scale studies , with a greater range of wavelengths are needed to determine whether this is a general result for reactive rayleigh - taylor , or if this is because of the small size domains considered here .",
    "one way we can get some insight into this is to rerun one of these simulations without burning .",
    "( note that in this case , we shift to a non - moving frame of reference whereas the reacting cases are performed in a reference frame moving at the laminar flame speed . )",
    "the growth rate for the @xmath0 run with burning disabled is over - plotted in figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7_width ] .",
    "we see that it is much smoother than the corresponding reactive case , since the spikes of fuel which push into the hot ash never burn away .",
    "the only wiggles in the mixing region growth curves result from bubble mergers .",
    "the fit to a power law for this non - reactive simulation is presented in figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7_noburn_width_fit ] . the carbon mass fraction for several points in time are shown in figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7_noburn ] , which compares directly to figure  [ fig : rt_1.e7 ] . here , @xmath86 , higher than the reactive case , but still not equal to 2.0 .",
    "the difference between this value and the reactive case shows that the burning does have some influence .",
    "in the non - reactive case we really do expect @xmath87 , and therefore the difference we see is very likely because we also are probably not following enough modes to see the sharp - wheeler scaling .    for the @xmath35 run ,",
    "we were closest to growing as @xmath80 .",
    "the burning here is quite vigorous , compared to the rt growth , so as argued above , we would expect to see its influence on the extent of the mixed region",
    ". however , we would expect it to affect the position of the spikes of fuel only , since the bubbles of ash do not react .",
    "therefore , we can fit the growth of the bubbles and spikes from the initial interface separately .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : rt_1.5e7_bubble_spike_fit ] .",
    "again , we exclude the initial linear growth phase of the instability .",
    "we find the bubble position growing as @xmath88 and the spike region growing as @xmath89 .",
    "based on the trends we see here and above , we would expect that once we have enough unstable modes in the box , the width of the mixed region during the bubble merger phase will scale as slightly smaller @xmath80 , with the bubble position itself growing as @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , more studies , in larger domains with more unstable modes are needed .",
    "it is interesting to look at how the size of the reactive region scales with that of the mixed region , especially at the lowest density . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : rt ] , if the reactive region grows to the size of the detonation matchhead , then it may be possible for a deflagration - detonation transition to occur .",
    "measuring the scaling of the reactive region to the mixed region is not easy , because the flame is so wrinkled .",
    "we will use a volume weighted definition here .",
    "the collection of zones , @xmath90 , where the carbon mass fraction , @xmath91 , is between @xmath92 and @xmath93 is @xmath94 similarly , we can define the collection of zones , @xmath95 , where the density - weighted carbon destruction rate , is within @xmath31 of the peak , @xmath96 then , the ratio of the size of the reactive region to the mixed region is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the volume of the zones in set @xmath90 .",
    "once the mixed region develops , we expect this quantity to be always less than unity . because of the freedom to choose the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath31 , the numerical value of @xmath99 itself does not have much meaning , but the trend with time does .",
    "we pick @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and two values of @xmath31 : 0.1 and 0.8 .",
    "we note that the trend is relatively insensitive to the choice of these parameters , as illustrated by figure  [ fig:6.67e6_scale ] , which shows @xmath99 as a function of time for the @xmath28 rt unstable flame for the two choices of @xmath31 . after an initial transient",
    ", it appears that these curves level off , indicating that the reactive region continues to growth in size proportional to the mixed region as the flame evolves .",
    "we note that this shows that the reactive region is a small fraction of the mixed region , but this absolute scaling is dependent on the choice of the three parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:6.67e6_scale_thresh ] , where the mixed and reactive regions are shown , midway through the calculation . at late times",
    ", the peak nuclear energy generation comes from regions where the carbon mass fraction is @xmath102 , as shown in figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_yc12_dydt ] .",
    "this is also apparent by looking at the laterally averaged flame profile and comparing to the laminar state ",
    "see figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_wide_averages ] .",
    "if this reactive region can growth to a critical matchhead size , before the entire star is consumed , it may be possible for a deflagration to detonation transition to proceed .",
    "however , since at late times the peak burning is occurring at mass fractions of 0.15 rather than 0.5 , this will greatly increase the required matchhead size , further complicating the possibility of a deflagration - detonation transition .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the role of domain size and resolution on the computational results .",
    "figures  [ fig : rt_6.67e6 ] and  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_small2 ] show the evolution of the @xmath103 rt simulation in narrower domains ( 96  cm and 384  cm wide respectively ) .",
    "other than the domain size , the parameters are identical to those used in the results described shown in figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_wide ] . in the narrowest case , once the size of the mixed region reaches a fixed size , comparable to the width of the domain , the mixing and reacting processes saturate and the flow enters a quasi - steady - state , with vortices that are remnants of the early mixing driving transverse shear flow in the mixed region .",
    "once this saturation is reached , the burning rate begins to slowly decay .",
    "this behavior is not seen in the corresponding wider domain calculation , although , we would expect a similar pattern if we use a taller domain and ran out to longer times .",
    "figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_speeds ] shows three additional curves corresponding to these narrower domains , the narrowest at two different resolutions ( see table  [ table : simparams ] ) . in the 96  cm wide domain ,",
    "the peak velocity is much smaller , reaching only about 3  times the laminar speed .",
    "this is to be expected from equation  ( [ eq : sw2])the wider domain allows longer wavelength modes to go unstable .",
    "the decrease in velocity at late times in the narrow domain begins when the size of the mixed layer becomes comparable to the width of the domain , preventing any further modes from growing .",
    "this is reflected in the later panels of figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6 ] . in the 384  cm wide domain , the velocity continues to grow , beyond 6  times the laminar speed  we would expect our widest domain run to continue to accelerate as well , but it began to interact with the top of our computational domain and was not run out as long .",
    "the velocity of the low resolution run tracks that of the high resolution case very closely , suggesting that , for the large scale diagnostics , we have converged .",
    "this lowest resolution run has approximately 5  points in the thermal width ( equation  [ eq : thermalwidth ] ) , a value found acceptable in the convergence study performed in @xcite for landau - darrieus unstable astrophysical flames .",
    "we note again that this definition of thermal width is smaller than some other commonly used definitions ( see , for example @xcite ) . finally , in all calculations , the initial perturbations are well resolved , with typically 50100 zones per wavelength ( with the only exception being the 96  cm wide , @xmath28 run , where there are only 20 zones per wavelength ) .",
    "this zoning is at or exceeds the resolution determined to give acceptable convergence of single - mode rt growth rates in the 3-d compressible study presented in @xcite .",
    "we also can look at how the scaling of the turbulent kinetic energy depends on the domain size .",
    "for the 384  cm wide , @xmath34 run , this is shown in figure  [ fig : rt_6.67e6_tke_small2 ] .",
    "two fits are shown .",
    "when all of the data is included , the fit is quite poor , since it is biased by by data at the end of the run when the mixing has saturated and the turbulent kinetic energy stops increasing . excluding this data , the fit to the first @xmath104  s is quite good , and with the kinetic energy @xmath105 quite close to the 2.267 power obtained from the 768  cm wide run .",
    "thus , it appears that the scaling of the turbulent kinetic energy prior to saturation is insensitive to the domain size .",
    "based upon the observed systematics of flame propagation in the distributed regime , we can begin to speculate on the potential for a transition to detonation . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , there are two possible modes for a delayed transition to detonation : a ) a `` local '' transition to detonation because a fluid element of critical mass burns with a supersonic phase velocity and b ) a `` macroscopic '' transition because some appreciable fraction of the white dwarf volume develops such complex topology that burning briefly consumes more fuel than could a spherical front encompassing that region and moving at supersonic speed .",
    "the former , also known as the zeldovich mechanism , is the basis for the `` delayed detonation model '' by @xcite ; the latter is the basis for a similar model by @xcite .",
    "@xcite has argued that the volume detonation model requires special preconditioning , but because we study only the small scales on which the flame is resolved , we can not comment in a meaningful way on this issue . also , because we have not included turbulence cascading down from scales larger than our grid , we can not conclusively argue about the local transition to detonation either ( a large amount of turbulence could , for example , induce a transition to distributed burning at a higher density ) . still some scaling relations are observed that , if they can be generalized by larger scale studies , argue against a transition to detonation .    as is well recognized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , transition to detonation can never occur so long as a well defined flame exists .",
    "the width of a steady flame is always thinner than the critical mass required for detonation .",
    "however , a mixture of hot fuel and cold ash is potentially explosive as calculations in the sn ia context @xcite have suggested .",
    "figure [ fig : carbon_destruction ] shows the existence , in the distributed regime , of localized hot spots of unsteady burning .",
    "the high temperature sensitivity of the @xmath20c + @xmath20c reaction itself makes it difficult for one of these hot spots to become supercritical in mass . for the conditions we consider , carbon fusion dominates the energetics , and",
    "the energy production is @xmath106 where @xmath91 is the mass fraction of carbon , and @xmath82 given by the coulomb barrier between two carbons nuclei , @xmath107 @xmath108 with @xmath109 the temperature in 10@xmath110 k. for our calculations with @xmath111 = @xmath112 , the temperature of the hot ash is @xmath113 . anticipating that the temperature of a combustible fuel - ash mixture will not be far from that",
    ", we find @xmath114 .",
    "the carbon mass fraction in the fuel is 0.5 and in the ash it is zero , and the temperature of the unburned fuel is negligible .    in any mixed mass , @xmath115 , composed of fractions @xmath116 of ash and @xmath117 of fuel",
    ", the temperature will be @xmath118 and the carbon mass fraction @xmath119 the dependence of the heat capacity on temperature is important and mitigates somewhat the extreme sensitivity of the reaction rate . in the vicinity of @xmath109 = 2.5 ,",
    "the heat capacity is predominantly due to the electron gas ( with @xmath120 ) , but with a non - negligible contribution from radiation ( @xmath121 ) @xcite .",
    "to good approximation , near @xmath109 = 2.5 , @xmath122 .",
    "the maximum in energy generation will then occur for @xmath123 \\ = \\ 0 \\enskip , \\ ] ] or for @xmath124that is , in the burning mixture , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "a factor of two variation in the energy generation occurs for @xmath127 , or @xmath91 from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "this agrees well with what is observed in the numerical simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rt_6.67e6_yc12_dydt ] ) .    coupled with the fact that burning to magnesium or silicon releases less energy than burning to the iron group",
    ", this low carbon mass fraction implies that the overpressure from burning will be small in the regions where ash and fuel are mixed .",
    "burning from @xmath130 to  @xmath131 , the typical ash temperature , will only raise the pressure by 8% .",
    "since this overpressure determines the temperature reached in a detonation and the burning rate depends on this to a high power , the critical mass for initiating a detonation will be large",
    ". the size will certainly be greater than the distance a sound wave can travel during the time it takes the mixture to burn . at @xmath109 = 2.2 and @xmath132 ,",
    "the nuclear time scale is @xmath133 or about 0.07  s. the speed of sound is approximately 5000  km  s@xmath134 .",
    "hence a critical mass for these conditions must be at least 300  km in size .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig:6.67e6_scale ] shows that , in steady state , the size of the reactive region is approximately a small constant times the size of the mixed region . even allowing a range of burning time scales of a factor of 10 across the burning region ,",
    "the explosive mixture only has dimensions about 10% that of the region that has been mixed by the rt instability .",
    "taking @xmath135 as an upper bound to that ( see  [ sec : growth ] ) , and realizing that the temperature will decline still further in a few tenths of a second because of expansion , the largest mixed , potentially explosive region is less than 5  km .",
    "thus , though a transition to detonation is in principal possible , there simply may not be room , nor time enough to develop one in an exploding white dwarf .",
    "we presented direct numerical simulations of reactive rt instabilities in conditions appropriate to the late stages of a type  ia supernova explosion .",
    "fully resolving the flame frees us from the need to specify any model parameters , such as the flame speed , markstein length , etc . in the density range",
    "we consider , the flame transitions from having a distinct , well defined interface at the high density end to being a chaotic , well mixed burning region at the lower density end , with a transition density of @xmath136 . this transition is expected based on the arguments presented in  [ sec : rt ] .",
    "furthermore , this would suggest that at the even higher densities characteristic of the early stage of the explosion , the flame surface continues to be well defined , consistent with the conclusions of @xcite and the 2-d flame - model simulations at @xmath1 presented in @xcite .",
    "the effects of the burning were further made concrete by presenting the @xmath0 case both with and without reactions .    at the lowest density , the mixed region becomes very large , although , still smaller than the critical carbon detonation matchhead size @xcite .",
    "it appears that the reactive region grows in direct proportion to the size of the mixed region , making it possible in theory that such a transition can occur , however , at these low densities , much of the star is already consumed , and , based on scaling predictions from the present simulations , the time required for the reactive region to grow to the matchhead size seems to be longer than the total explosion time . in effect",
    ", the flame runs out of star before a critical mass can be built up .",
    "future simulations will explore this in more depth .    in all cases presented here ,",
    "the flames accelerated considerably , reaching speeds between  2 and 6  times the laminar flame speed .",
    "this is significantly larger than accelerations seen in small - scale / resolved landau - darrieus instability studies ( paper  i ) .",
    "the growth of the flame surface appeared to be well described by a fractal model , with a fractal dimension of @xmath137 . in the cases considered ,",
    "the effective flame speed was asymptotically proportional to the increase in flame surface area but the constant of proportionality was about 0.1 for the low density cases and 0.3 for the higher density case .",
    "thus , the flame acceleration was considerably less than would be predicted by the increase in flame surface area alone .",
    "this proportionality constant may approach unity as the density is increased , because the smallest scale on which the rt instability can bend the flame ( the fire - polishing length ) increases dramatically with density , and therefore the magnitude of the curvature that the flame experiences locally decreases .",
    "we would expect that on larger domains the flame would continue to accelerate , further supporting the already widely held view that the rt instability provides most of the acceleration to the flame in a pure deflagration type  ia sne explosion .",
    "the growth of the mixed region for the reactive rt instability appears to be slower than the non - reactive case .",
    "the present results do not seem to support the sharp - wheeler model , but larger scale studies are needed , with more bubbles merging over a longer period of time to better understand the growth of the mixed region .",
    "understanding the growth of the mixed region is critical to providing an accurate subgrid model .",
    "future studies will focus on the three - dimensional counterparts to the flames we discussed here .",
    "turbulence behaves very differently in two and three dimensions , so we expect to see some differences in the evolution of the instability .",
    "numerical results indicate that the growth rate of the pure rt instability is faster in 3-d than in 2-d @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in 3-d the surface to volume ratio of the spikes of fuel is larger than in 2-d , exposing more fuel to the hot ash , so we may expect them to burn away more quickly . we still expect , based on the arguments presented in  [ sec : rt ] and the results of the simulations , that the flame will undergoing the same transition in behavior as the density decreases .",
    "larger two - dimensional studies in the flamelet regime are also needed , moving toward higher densities . capturing a greater range of scales on",
    "the grid will allow for validation of the fractal scaling model and a better understanding of the moderation of the sharp - wheeler prediction for the growth of the mixed region .",
    "finally , these fully resolved simulations can serve as the basis for testing various models to represent the flame on subgrid scales , which become necessary to address the larger scale type  ia physics .",

    "<S> we investigate the rayleigh - taylor unstable flame at the transition from the flamelet regime to the distributed - burning regime , around densities of @xmath0 , through detailed , fully resolved simulations . a low mach number , adaptive mesh hydrodynamics code is used to achieve the necessary resolution and long time scales . as the density </S>",
    "<S> is varied , we see a fundamental change in the character of the burning  at the low end of the density range the rayleigh - taylor instability dominates the burning , whereas at the high end the burning suppresses the instability . in all cases , significant acceleration of the flame is observed , limited only by the size of the domain we are able to study . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these results on the potential for a deflagration to detonation transition . </S>"
