    "condition [ kd4 ] implies that @xmath222 and @xmath186 have negative lyapunov exponent in the center direction .",
    "so they are physical measures .    as before , their basins are intermingled .",
    "the argument is the same : take any curve @xmath223 in the interior of @xmath260 and transverse to the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "up to some forward iterates , @xmath223 crosses ( transversally ) the surfaces @xmath261 and @xmath262 $ ] . this is possible since @xmath21 is uniformly expanding along the unstable direction and the domination improves the angle between @xmath223 and the center - stable direction .",
    "then , there is a forward iterate of @xmath223 that intersects the basin of @xmath222 in a set of positive lebesgue measure ( in @xmath223 ) , because @xmath223 intersects transversally the stable manifold @xmath263 .",
    "since @xmath223 also intersects transversally the stable manifold @xmath264 , then @xmath223 intersects the basin of @xmath186 in a set of positive lebesgue measure .",
    "fubini s theorem complete the argument .",
    "as before , this example is robust among the diffeomorphisms defined on @xmath260 preserving the boundary tori .",
    "the same construction can be done if @xmath260 is replaced with @xmath265 ( or even the mapping torus of a hyperbolic diffeomorphism ) and @xmath266 $ ] is replaced with @xmath267 .",
    "then , the four conditions are :    1 .   for every @xmath247 we have @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath250 ,",
    "fixed point of @xmath183 , we assume that the map @xmath270 has exactly two fixed points , a source at @xmath271 and a sink in @xmath211 .",
    "analogously , the map @xmath272 has exactly two fixed points , a sink at @xmath271 and a source in @xmath211 .",
    "3 .   for every @xmath253 , @xmath273 , and 4 .   @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "exactly the same proof gives that the basins of the lebesgue measures of the boundary tori are intermingled .",
    "the difference is that this phenomenon is no longer robust .",
    "in fact , there exists a unique physical measure after most perturbations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , bonatti and potrie announced that they are able to construct diffeomorphisms on the torus @xmath2 with exactly @xmath276 hyperbolic physical measures @xmath277 whose basins are all intermingled ( and dense on the whole torus ) , in fact , for every open set @xmath278 and every @xmath279    @xmath280    their example is partially hyperbolic in the following broad sense : the tangent space has an invariant splitting @xmath281 where @xmath282 dominates @xmath18 but the sub - bundle @xmath18 is indecomposable into dominated sub - bundles .",
    "we remark that partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on surfaces do not admit intermingled hyperbolic physical measures @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in the absence of domination as showed by fayad @xcite .",
    "inspired in the fayad example , melbourne and windsor @xcite give a family of @xmath283-diffeomorphisms on @xmath284 with arbitrary number of physical measures with intermingled basins .",
    "motivated by the latter situation , we say that a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism @xmath21 is a _ kan - like differmorphisms _ if there exist , at least , two hyperbolic physical measures with intermingled basins .",
    "let @xmath285 , @xmath24 , be partially hyperbolic and dynamically coherent with compact center leaves .",

    "then , it is not difficult to see there is a sequence @xmath300 such that the distance between @xmath301 and @xmath302 converges to @xmath303 . indeed , if there is @xmath304 such that the distance of @xmath305 to @xmath302 is greater than @xmath303 you can construct a continuous which that takes the value @xmath306 for every point in @xmath302 and @xmath303 if the distance to @xmath302 is greater or equal to @xmath307 .",

    "our strategy to prove theorem [ mteo : a ] will be to study the intersections of the set @xmath27 with the center manifolds of @xmath21 .",
    "let s begin with the proof .",
    "suppose on the contrary that for every @xmath354 there are @xmath356 and three points @xmath352 with @xmath357 for every pair of points @xmath358 .",
    "take the topological surfaces @xmath359 , @xmath360 and @xmath361 . without loose of generality",

    "since @xmath366 , lemma [ l1 ] implies that it can be approximated by a point @xmath367 belonging to @xmath368 . by lemma [ l2 ]",
    "we have that @xmath367 can be joined to @xmath369 by a center arc completely contained in @xmath370 .",
    "observe that @xmath367 is very close to @xmath371 and then , the length of this center arc is greater than , say , @xmath372 .",
    "still much larger than @xmath354 .",
    "this implies that the center arc joining @xmath367 and @xmath369 must intersect either @xmath359 or @xmath361 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "[ finito ] let @xmath0 be an ergodic @xmath20-measure with negative center exponent and @xmath27 an invariant @xmath20-saturated set such that @xmath374 .",
    "then , the intersection of @xmath27 with each center manifold consists of finitely many points .",
    "let @xmath317 be a point of continuity of @xmath379 .",
    "continuity at @xmath317 implies that @xmath380 if @xmath381 is close enough to @xmath317 .",
    "the @xmath20-minimality , again , implies the inequality for every @xmath382 .",
    "suppose that the function @xmath378 is not constant .",
    "then , there is a dense set @xmath383 such that for @xmath384 we have that @xmath385 .",
    "continuity at @xmath317 implies that there are a point @xmath386 , a sequence @xmath387 and for each integer @xmath127 , a pair of points @xmath388 , @xmath389 so that both sequences @xmath390 , @xmath391 , converge to @xmath51",
    ". then , taking @xmath260 large enough we can choose a center curve with two points @xmath392 and @xmath393 a very small @xmath353-distance .",
    "we will argue in a similar way to the arguments of the proof of lemma [ lemah ] .",
    "we want to obtain three points that are very close to each other in the same center manifold and surfaces through them that are not in @xmath370 , to arrive to a contradiction with lemma [ l2 ] .",

    "continuity of the holonomy gives that there are center manifolds converging to the center manifold of @xmath75 and pairs of points @xmath396 of @xmath375 in each of these center manifolds converging to @xmath75 .",
    "finally , fix an integer @xmath397 large enough ( in such a way that the @xmath353 distance between @xmath398 and @xmath399 is much smaller than the one between @xmath395 and @xmath400 ) and call @xmath401 and @xmath402 .",
    "denote @xmath403 the center leaf that contains @xmath404 .",
    "because of the choices we have made , @xmath405 intersects @xmath403 in a point @xmath406 that is close to @xmath407 and @xmath408 but at a greater distance than @xmath409 .",
    "that means that one of the two points @xmath410 lies in between the other two ( see figure [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath376 be @xmath20-minimal and closed .",
    "lemma [ constant ] shows that @xmath375 is locally the graph of a continuous function and then , it is a closed topological surface topologically transverse to the center foliation .",

    "moreover , proposition [ finito ] implies that the torus @xmath375 is periodic .",
    "thus , all that remains is to prove that the strong stable manifolds of the points of @xmath375 are completely contained in @xmath375 .",
    "as @xmath376 is periodic , we can take an iterate @xmath127 such that @xmath411 . by simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath412 .",
    "suppose that there is a point @xmath413 such that its strong stable manifold @xmath414 has a point @xmath362 that does not belong to @xmath375 .",

    "in particular , @xmath424 and its omega limit is contained in @xmath369 . since @xmath375 is @xmath21-invariant , then @xmath425 which contradicts the hypotheses @xmath426 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the theorem  [ mteo : a ] .",
    "first of all , observe that neither @xmath0 nor @xmath30 can have positive center lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is a consequence of the well - known fact that under our hypotheses the basin of attraction of such a measure would be essentially open ( see for instance @xcite where the conservative case is discussed with details and recently @xcite for a discussion about the non conservative case . ) .",
    "suppose that the center exponents are negative .",
    "if their basins are intermingled then @xmath427 . indeed , it is not difficult to see that the definition of intermingled basins implies that there is a point of the stable manifold ( in the sense of pesin ) of a regular point of @xmath30 that is accumulated by points of the basin of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath30 is ergodic the orbit of a regular point is dense in its support . by forward iteration",
