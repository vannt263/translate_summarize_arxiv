    "most of the compact objects currently investigated and modeled in astrophysics are observable `` because of the presence of some matter or radiation around them ( we will often term them as central objects '' below ) . at the lowest order of approximation",
    ", the associated gravitational field can be described by the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution , when shape deformation and rotation effects of the source can be neglected , and matter can be considered as a collection of test particles moving along geodesics . however , this is only an idealized situation which is likely not to represent any real astrophysical system .",
    "the dynamics of a body orbiting a compact object is indeed strongly influenced by the combined effect of the overall gravitational field , the surrounding matter and in turn the radiation distribution associated with high energy processes arising thereby .",
    "a typical example is represented by a luminous compact object surrounded by orbiting matter , such as accretion discs around a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe are the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which are believed to be powered by mass accretion onto black holes .",
    "their emitting range is from @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ( e.g. , the nuclei of some nearby galaxies ) to more than @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 ( distant quasars ) , which is far beyond the eddington luminosity ( about @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , the x - ray variability in agns and the disc emission lines might contain imprints of the radiation drag effects .    in a series of papers",
    "we have studied the dynamics of test particles in a given gravitational background while subject to a thomson - type interaction with a superimposed test radiation field , namely the so called poynting - robertson ( pr ) effect @xcite .",
    "we modeled the radiation flux as made of photons emitted all along a common direction from a point - like source , leading to an effective drag force to be added to the gravitational force .",
    "more realistic descriptions would take into account the finite size of the radiating source and allow for photons to be emitted in any direction .",
    "however , the computation of the radiation force in this case usually requires complicated numerical ray - tracing calculations for null geodesics in the background spacetime .",
    "the general relativistic stress - energy tensor associated with such a more general scenario was constructed for the first time in the pioneering work of @xcite , who considered the special case of test bodies radially moving in the spacetime of a spherically symmetric non - rotating radiation source with finite radius to model jets and solar winds .",
    "they studied the radial equilibrium solutions in which the test particle remains at rest under the combined inward gravitational attraction and the outward photon pressure ( the eddington sphere  ) .",
    "the stability of this equilibrium configuration has been recently investigated by @xcite , who have also discussed its implications for hoyle - lyttleton accretion onto a luminous star ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have then analyzed the effects of a luminosity variation on the eddington sphere , especially in view of the possible occurrence of coronal ejection from the system . within this framework , leaving the spherical symmetry makes the problem very difficult to be addressed .",
    "the generalization of the abramowicz et al .",
    "approach to the case of an arbitrary particle motion in the equatorial plane of a rotating source is due to @xcite , but in the limit of slow rotation only .",
    "their model was then used by @xcite to study the existence of equilibrium solutions .    following the original robertson approach , we have considered so far different spacetime solutions of astrophysical interest endowed with reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane , like black hole solutions ( schwarzschild and kerr ) @xcite or radiating spacetimes ( vaidya ) @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of coupling with additional properties of test particles ( like intrinsic spin ) @xcite .",
    "the main result of our previous analysis is that particles moving on the symmetry plane ( which do not escape ) are definitely attracted to a certain critical radius where they orbit the central source maintaining equilibrium . in general , the critical radius is not unique for sufficiently large values of the impact parameter of the photons as well as of the strength of the radiation field .    here we explore the case of a central source having a quadrupolar structure as described by the erez - rosen solution .",
    "this is an exact solutions to the vacuum einstein s field equations which generalizes the schwarzschild spacetime to the case of a gravitational source endowed with an arbitrary mass quadrupole moment , and hence it is specified by two parameters , the mass @xmath4 and the quadrupole parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this situation has a strong astrophysical motivation and represents a natural generalization of previous results , even if rotational effects are neglected .",
    "in fact , also the kerr solution possesses a non - vanishing quadrupole moment , but the latter is induced by the spacetime rotation . here",
    ", the quadrupole parameter @xmath5 describes a genuine mass quadrupole moment directly related to the shape deformation of the source .",
    "for instance , the supermassive objects hosted in galaxy centers are generally expected to be also endowed with a non - negligible mass quadrupole moment , which may affect the dynamics of stars moving in the region very close to the central object @xcite . besides rotation , torques from the source s quadrupole moment cause in general precession of the stellar orbital planes , which can be measured by high - precision astrometry .",
    "this is the case of the compact cluster of stars orbiting the center of the milky way galaxy at milliparsec distances , monitored since many years @xcite .",
    "taking into account quadrupolar deformations is also important when considering the spacetime region around neutron stars , which can assume a pronounced oblate configuration .",
    "neutron stars can be part of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , where they are spun up by matter that accretes from a companion , which is typically either a low mass star or a white dwarf .",
    "for a dynamically negligible magnetic field , the accretion disc of lmxbs can extend down to the star s surface , where curvature effects dominate .",
    "therefore , the observed flux emitted in the inner part of the disc may contain the signatures of a more complicated structure of the source , which can be inferred from available x - ray data .",
    "however , significant quadrupolar deformations are mainly due to rotation , as in the case of kerr black holes or rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "hence , an accurate description of the above systems would need also the inclusion of rotation , which is but beyond the scope of the present analysis , mostly motivated to better understand the role of the quadrupole .",
    "the main outcome of this work is the analysis of the effects induced on the equilibrium solutions by the quadrupolar deformation of the source .",
    "this is a typical feature of particles undergoing pr effect already discussed in previous works , as already mentioned .",
    "we will show that the presence of the quadrupolar structure of the source of the gravitational field may affect the conditions for equilibrium in a significant way , introducing an additional degree of freedom with respect to spherically symmetric sources represented by the quadrupole parameter .",
    "this feature can in principle give rise to observable effects .",

    "the gravitational field of a nonrotating mass with a quadrupole moment can be described by the erez - rosen solution @xcite .",

    "positive values of @xmath5 correspond to prolate configurations , i.e. , the mass is mostly concentrated along the axes @xmath19 , whereas negative values to oblate ones .",
    "when @xmath20 , the metric ( [ metric_weyl ] ) reduces to the schwarzschild solution provided that @xmath11 be identified with the mass of the source , namely @xmath21 .",
    "transition of this metric form to the more familiar one associated with standard schwarzschild - like coordinates is accomplished by the following coordinate transformation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the above solution reduces to the well known hartle - thorne spacetime @xcite with vanishing rotation parameter when linearized with respect to the quadrupole parameter .",
    "a suitable family of fiducial observers is that of the so called static observers , with unit timelike four velocity @xmath24 aligned with the timelike killing vector @xmath25 .",
    "they are accelerated with acceleration @xmath26 .",
    "an orthonormal frame adapted to the static observers is thus given by e_t = n , e_x=1_x , e_y=1_y , e_=1_.    the four acceleration as well as the curvature vectors @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , associated with the diagonal metric coefficients @xcite only have nonzero components in the @xmath14-@xmath15 2-plane of the tangent space , i.e. , @xmath29 we limit our analysis to the symmetry plane @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , both the acceleration and the curvature vectors are directed along the @xmath31axis , which hereafter will be referred to as the radial  direction .",
    "let a pure electromagnetic radiation field be superposed as a test field on the gravitational background described by the metric ( [ metric_weyl])([metdef ] ) , with the energy - momentum tensor [ ten_imp ] t^=^2 k^k^ , k^k_=0  , where @xmath32 is assumed to be tangent to an affinely parametrized ( ingoing / outgoing ) null geodesic in the symmetry plane , i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    "the incoming particle feels a stronger gravitational field as it approaches the gravity source . for prolate configurations , instead , the gravitational mass is mainly concentrated along the @xmath66axis , i.e. , orthogonally to the symmetry plane where the motion takes place , so that a particle moving sufficiently close to the gravity source will feel a decreasing gravitational field , since most of the gravitational action is being neutralized there .",
    "the main outcome of our analysis is that there exists a whole family of equilibrium solutions ( circular orbits ) representing the balance between gravitational attraction , centrifugal force and radiation drag .",
    "in fact , if the strength of the radiation field is fixed , the quadrupole parameter of the source can be used to parametrize this family , so leading to a scenario which is more rich with respect to that of a spherically symmetric source .",
    "the associated stability analysis has allowed to determine the isco radius as a function of the parameters characterizing the radiation field as well as of the quadrupole parameter of the source .",
    "we have found that for a given value of the quadrupole parameter there exist in general two disconnected regions where circular orbits are stable : one very close to the central object , and another for larger radii , which is relevant for observational effects .",
    "this analysis can be straightforwardly extended to more general situations , e.g. , by accounting for quadrupolar sources also endowed with nonvanishing rotation .",

    "higher multipole moments of the order @xmath101 , @xmath102 , are determined by @xmath5 and @xmath4 in such a way that they all vanish when @xmath20 .",

    "in particular the hypersurface @xmath49 , which is null in the schwarzschild case , becomes directionally singular .",
    "furthermore , its character depends both on the value of @xmath5 .",
