    "mobile data traffic has been shifting from connection - oriented services such as voice telephony and text messaging to content - oriented services such as media streaming , application downloads / updates and social network communications .",
    "regarding content - oriented services , there has been an increasing demand to send the same popular contents to multiple users .",
    "owing to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium , multicasting is an efficient way to deliver widely popular contents from a transmitter to multiple users concurrently .",
    "a lot of existing works on multicasting have assumed that all the content requests arrive synchronously to the same cell and focus on the analysis of multicasting gains under this assumption @xcite . to fully unleash the multicasting benefit , one needs to accommodate asynchronous and spatially distributed requests in wireless networks .",
    "caching popular contents at base stations ( bss ) is also an effective way for massive content delivery in wireless networks , as it can greatly alleviate backhaul load and reduce service time .",
    "multicasting and caching have been jointly considered for content - oriented applications in wireless networks@xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors consider multicasting to minimize the average energy and delay costs for elastic services in cache - enabled wireless networks , by aggregating asynchronous common requests within a fixed time window .",
    "the temporal aggregations of asynchronous common content requests yield a tradeoff between the spectral efficiency gain due to increased multicasting opportunities and the access delay penalty due to temporal aggregations .",
    "note that the pure temporal aggregations of common content requests at the same cell in @xcite may not fully exploit multicasting opportunities because there are a lot of common requests which are generated at different spatial locations . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider spatial aggregations of synchronous common content requests at nearby cells , without considering temporal aggregations of asynchronous common content requests .",
    "in addition , in the analysis and design , @xcite fail to consider the stochastic natures of channel fading and geographic locations of bss and users as well as interference , which are key aspects in wireless networks .    in this paper",
    ", we consider content - centric applications with asynchronous and spatially distributed content requests for elastic services in a large - scale cache - enabled wireless network .",
    "we propose a novel temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme to enhance multicasting opportunities so as to improve spectral efficiency .",
    "the proposed multicasting scheme creates more multicasting opportunities at the same energy and delay costs compared with the existing multicasting schemes in @xcite , and hence it can achieve a better energy - throughput - delay tradeoff . by carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate approximations , we derive a tractable expression for the successful transmission probability in the general region , utilizing tools from stochastic geometry . using asymptotic approximations ,",
    "we derive closed form successful transmission probabilities in the large delay region as well as the large and small user density regions , respectively .",
    "the asymptotic results reveal that the successful transmission probability increases and the energy consumption decreases at the cost of delay increase in these asymptotic regions .",
    "the analysis in this paper offers a new understanding of the energy - throughput - delay tradeoff for massive content delivery in large - scale cache - enabled wireless networks .",
    "as illustrated in fig  [ fig : system ] , we consider a large - scale network model .",
    "the locations of bss are spatially distributed as an independent homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath0 with density @xmath1 .",
    "the locations of users are distributed as an independent homogeneous ppp @xmath2 with density @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the downlink transmission .",
    "each bs has one transmit antenna with transmission power @xmath4 .",
    "each user has one receive antenna .",
    "the total bandwidth is @xmath5 ( hz ) .",
    "consider a discrete - time system with time being slotted .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the slot index . due to large - scale pathloss , transmitted signals with distance @xmath7 are attenuated by a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the path loss exponent . for small - scale fading , we assume rayleigh fading .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the set of @xmath11 files ( contents ) in the network .",
    "for ease of illustration , we assume that all files have the same size .",
    "each file is of certain popularity .",
    "we assume that the file popularity distribution is identical among all users . at the beginning of each slot",
    ", each user randomly requests one file which is file @xmath12 with probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the file popularity distribution is given by @xmath15 , which is assumed to be known priori .",
    "in addition , without loss of generality ( w.l.o.g . ) , we assume @xmath16 .",
    "we consider delay tolerant services .",
    "each file request may not need to be satisfied within one slot .",
    "+      the network consists of cache - enabled bss .",
    "in particular , each bs is equipped with a cache of size @xmath17 , storing @xmath18 different files out of @xmath19 .",
    "every @xmath18 different files form a combination .",
    "there are @xmath20 different combinations of @xmath18 different files in total .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the set of @xmath22 combinations .",
    "combination @xmath23 can be characterized by an @xmath19-dimensional vector @xmath24 , where @xmath25 indicates that file @xmath26 is included in combination @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "denote @xmath29 as the set of @xmath18 files contained in combination @xmath27 .",
    "we consider random caching on the basis of file combinations . each bs cache stores combination @xmath23 with probability @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "a random caching design is specified by the caching distribution @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the set of @xmath35 combinations containing file @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the probability that file @xmath26 is stored at a bs . in this paper , we focus on serving cached files at bss to get first - order insights into the design of cache - enabled wireless networks .",
    "bss may serve uncached files through other service mechanisms , the investigation of which is beyond the scope of this paper .      as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , content requests are usually generated at different times and locations . to fully unleash the multicasting benefit , we propose a novel temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme where the aggregation of requests in time is based on a periodic bs on / off mechanism and the aggregation in space is induced by caching .",
    "specifically , we consider a periodic bs on / off mechanism with period @xmath37 ( in slots ) .",
    "first , all bss are randomly divided into @xmath38 tiers according to the uniform distribution .",
    "that is , a bs is assigned to tier @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 .",
    "the locations of the bss in each tier @xmath41 are distributed as an independent homogeneous ppp @xmath42 with density @xmath43 . note that each tier of bss is on once every @xmath38 slots . in particular , if @xmath44 , then only the bss in tier @xmath41 are on in slot @xmath45 .",
    "an active bs ( being on ) can serve file requests , while an inactive bs ( being off ) can not .",
    "we assume a bs can always receive file requests , no matter being on or off . in slot @xmath45 ,",
    "a user requesting file @xmath26 submits the file request to the neatest bs storing a combination @xmath46 , referred to as the serving bs of this file request , as this bs offers the maximum long - term average receive power for file @xmath26 at this user .",
    "this file request will be served by this bs within @xmath38 slots once the bs is on .",
    "note that the serving bs of a user s file request may not be its geographically nearest bs and is also statistically determined by the caching distribution @xmath47 .",
    "we propose a temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme for delay tolerant content dissemination in the cache - enabled wireless network .",
    "consider a bs which is on in slot @xmath48 ( and is off in the previous @xmath49 slots ) .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the number of different file requests for the @xmath18 files stored at this bs during the latest @xmath38 slots , including the current slot and the previous @xmath49 slots . in slot @xmath45",
    ", the active bs transmits each of the @xmath51 files at rate @xmath52 ( bits / second ) and over @xmath53 of the total bandwidth @xmath5 using frequency division multiple access ( fdma ) . in other words , in slot @xmath45 , the active bs tries to serve all the users requesting the same file from it in the latest @xmath38 slots using one single transmission , and these users try to decode the file from the single transmission .",
    "note that the proposed multicasting scheme with @xmath54 reduces to the continuous multicasting scheme in @xcite , where each bs is always on and serves file requests in every slot without considering temporal aggregations of asynchronous content requests .    the proposed temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme with periodic bs on / off of period @xmath38 exhibits the following features , which can not be realized in the existing multicasting schemes for cache - enabled wireless networks .    * * reduction of energy consumption ( and interference ) : * the transmission energy consumption ( and interference ) is only caused by approximate @xmath40 of bss , and hence the energy consumption ( and interference ) is greatly reduced , * * increase of multicasting opportunities : * each active bs serves @xmath38 times of the file requests in one slot , and hence the chance of a transmitted file being requested by more than one user significantly increases .",
    "therefore , by temporal aggregation , this multicasting scheme can achieve @xmath40 energy consumption and @xmath38 times multicasting opportunities , at the cost of @xmath38 times delay , compared to the continuous multicasting scheme in @xcite .",
    "in addition , by spatial aggregation , this multicasting scheme can achieve more multicasting opportunities at the same energy and delay costs as the discrete multicasting schemes in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we mainly focus on investigating how the reduction of the energy consumption and the increase of the multicasting opportunities affect the content delivery .",
    "in this paper , w.l.o.g . , we study the performance for serving a file request from a typical user @xmath55 located at the origin at a typical slot @xmath56 .",
    "for ease of analysis , we assume all bss are active . supposing the file requested by @xmath55 at slot @xmath57 is file @xmath26 , file @xmath26 is transmitted by @xmath58 in tier @xmath59 at slot @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "then , at slot @xmath60 , the corresponding received signal at @xmath55 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the distance between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the small - scale channel between @xmath65 and @xmath64 , @xmath67 is the transmit signal from @xmath65 to @xmath64 , @xmath68 is the distance between bs @xmath69 and @xmath64 , @xmath70 is the small - scale channel between bs @xmath69 and @xmath64 , @xmath71 is the transmit signal from bs @xmath69 to its scheduled users , and @xmath72 is the complex additive white gaussian noise of power @xmath73 . the signal - to - interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) for @xmath64 at slot @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "note that when @xmath76 , @xmath77 is a continuous random variable , the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of which depends on the bs on / off period @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , at slot @xmath60 , let @xmath78 denote the number of requests for different files received by the users from @xmath65 during the latest @xmath38 slots , indicating the file load of bs @xmath65 at slot @xmath60 .",
    "note that when @xmath76 , @xmath79 is a discrete random variable , the probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) of which depends on the user density @xmath3 and bs on / off period @xmath38 . under the proposed temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme ,",
    "each of the @xmath79 requested files is sent over bandwidth @xmath80 to all the users requesting the file from @xmath65 within the latest @xmath38 slots .",
    "thus , the capacity of the channel between @xmath65 and @xmath55 at slot @xmath60 is given by @xmath81 .",
    "the dissemination of file @xmath26 at rate @xmath52 can be decoded correctly at @xmath55 if @xmath82 . then",
    ", the successful transmission probability of file @xmath26 requested by @xmath55 at slot @xmath57 is given by and @xmath77 depend on @xmath47 and @xmath38 .",

    "the successful transmission probability under the proposed scheme is given by @xmath85",
    "in this part , we would like to analyze the successful transmission probability in the general ( bs on / off period and user density ) region , using tools from stochastic geometry .",
    "for the tractability of the analysis , as in @xcite , the dependence between @xmath79 and @xmath77 is ignored .",

    ", different from @xcite , we need the density of the users who request file @xmath89 within the latest @xmath38 slots up to slot @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath90 , instead of the density of the users who request file @xmath89 within one slot , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "next , we calculate the cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . ) of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath92 $ ] , which is denoted as @xmath93 .",
    "note that different from @xcite , to evaluate the interference under the temporal - spatial aggregation - based multicasting scheme with periodic bs on / off , we only consider the active bss in @xmath94 at slot @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we can derive @xmath95 .",

    "the performance gain over the discrete multicasting scheme comes from the improvement of the spectral efficiency , and the performance gain over the continuous multicasting scheme is due to the fact that more multicasting opportunities are utilized by aggregating asynchronous common requests in time .    in the following , we study the impact of the bs on / off period @xmath38 on @xmath108 , for any given @xmath47 .",
