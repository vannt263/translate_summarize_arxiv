    "the behavior of scattering in the limit of high energy and fixed momentum transfer is described in qcd , at least for situations in which perturbation theory applies , by the balitskii - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) pomeron  @xcite ( or short distance pomeron ) .",
    "attempts to test experimentally this sector of qcd have started in the last few years , mainly based on measurements of deeply inelastic events at low values of the bjorken variable @xmath1 in lepton - hadron scattering  @xcite and jet production at large rapidity separations in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the possibilities for investigating qcd pomeron effects in a different context , namely in photon - photon scattering at @xmath2 colliders , where the photons are produced from the lepton beams by bremsstrahlung .",

    "@xcite ) , essentially because it does not involve a non - perturbative target . unlike protons or quasi - real photons ,",
    "virtual photon states can be described through perturbative wave functions . in some respects",
    "the off - shell photon cross section presents analogies with the process of scattering of two quarkonia ( or `` onia '' ) , which has been proposed as a gedanken experiment to investigate the high energy regime in qcd  @xcite . in this case , non - perturbative effects are suppressed by the smallness of the onium radius . in the case of virtual photons the size of the wave function is controlled by the photon virtuality instead of the heavy quark mass .",
    "it is an interesting feature of investigations at @xmath6 colliders that this size can be tuned by measuring the momenta of the outgoing leptons .",
    "on the other hand , such experimental studies may prove to be difficult due to the smallness of the available rates .",
    "as we shall see , for large photon virtualities @xmath7 the cross section falls off like @xmath8 .",
