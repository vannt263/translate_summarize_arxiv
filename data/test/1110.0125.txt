    "the microscopic nature of high-@xmath0 superconductivity in the cuprates is still under heavy debate after more than two decades of intensive studies .",
    "it has been widely accepted that the cuprates may be properly considered as doped mott insulators and the superconductivity arises after the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) long range order is destroyed by doping .",
    "the challenge is that a typical doped mott insulator is a strongly correlated electron system in which two electrons staying at the same lattice site will cost a huge energy as compared to other energy scales like the hopping energy . with the failure of conventional perturbative many - body methods , to tackle a doped mott insulator one usually resorts to either the so - called gutzwiller projected trial wavefunction or constructing an effective low - energy theory @xcite . in the latter approach , the electron fractionalization @xcite",
    "is often utilized in order to implement some key features of a doped mott insulator .",
    "indeed , the fractionalization due to the mottness is most transparent at half - filling where only the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons are left , with the charge part being totally frozen out . only by doping",
    "can charge carriers emerge which account for a small portion of the total number of the electrons at low doping .",
    "the real challenge is that there exist many different ways of introducing fractionalized elementary objects to implement the same local mottness , i.e. , the no double occupancy constraint .",
    "these elementary particles are generally further coupled to some emergent gauge field(s ) due to the uncertainty in the fractionalization @xcite . in the lack of precise energetic comparison ,",
    "a full self - consistent development of a potential fractionalization / gauge theory becomes essential in order for it to be convincingly verified or falsified by experiment as well as by general theoretical considerations . in principle",
    ", an inappropriate fractionalization would always lead to strong gauge fluctuations rendering the effective theory intractable .",
    "therefore , a stable , well - controlled gauge theory description will be a highly desired candidate for the correct low - energy theory of cuprate superconductors .",
    "we will consider a particular electron fractionalization description with a mutual chern - simons gauge structure @xcite .",
    "specifically , an electron in this theory is fractionalized  into an @xmath1 bosonic spinon and a charge @xmath2 bosonic holon , which are minimally coupled to u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which do not have their own dynamics , but are entangled  by a mutual chern - simons topological term @xmath5which is ( 2 + 1)d realization of the topological bf theory.@xcite physically it simply means that the spinons and holons will perceive each other as quantized @xmath6 fluxoids @xcite . in the limit of zero hole concentration",

    "ii . instead of",
    "a conventional ginzburg - landau theory in description of the fluctuations of the pairing order parameter , we obtain a gauge description of the low - lying collective fluctuations of charge and spin currents , which are essentially the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",

    "iii , we further  identify a non - bcs - type order parameter @xmath9 that characterizes the sc phase coherence . here",
    "@xmath9 is related to the correlation function of two wilson loops ( of @xmath4 and @xmath10 ) and is topological as it merely depends on the gaussian linking number under a continuous deformation of the loops .",
    "such a relation is similar to the connection between the chern - simons theory and knot theory first studied in ref . .",
    "but by coupling to the matter fields , we show that the spin correlations strongly renormalize @xmath9 such that the phase coherence terminates at a critical point where the spin gap vanishes . in sec .",
    "iii c , we shall propose a direct experimental probe of such a topological nature of the gauge interaction between the spin and charge degrees of freedom . finally , in sec .",
    "iii d , we show that a fermionic excitation can emerge in the superconducting phase , which is gauge neutral and thus coherent , resembling a bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
