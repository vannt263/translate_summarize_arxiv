    "cosmic ray distributions of various aspects have been measured , most notably the steeply falling spectrum up to the ultra - high energy regime with cosmic ray energies even exceeding @xmath4  eev @xcite .    for ultra - high energy cosmic rays , deflections in magnetic fields should diminish with increasing energy , such that directional correlations should lead to a straight - forward identification of accelerating sites . however , even at the highest energies the arrival distributions of cosmic rays appear to be rather isotropic .",
    "only hints for departures from isotropic distributions have been reported , e.g. , a so - called hot spot @xcite , and a dipole signal @xcite . at least with the apparent isotropy , limits on the density of extragalactic sources",
    "were derived which depend on the cosmic ray energy @xcite .",
    "a recent determination of ultra - high energy cosmic ray composition from measurements of the shower depth in the atmosphere revealed contributions of heavy nuclei above @xmath5  eev @xcite .",
    "this observation may explain the seemingly isotropic arrival distribution as deflections of nuclei in magnetic fields scale with their nuclear charges @xmath1 .    obviously , when searching for cosmic ray sources , a key role is therefore attributed to magnetic fields .",
    "the galactic field in particular is strong enough to displace original arrival directions of protons with energy @xmath6  eev by several degrees from their original arrival directions outside the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the displacement angles for nuclei even reach tens of degrees .",
    "the knowledge on the extragalactic magnetic fields is much less certain , but is likely to be less important than the galactic field and is not studied in this contribution .    to identify sources of cosmic rays , rather precise corrections for the propagation within the galactic magnetic field",
    "are needed . in previous directional correlation analyses ,",
    "only the overall magnitude of deflections was taken into account , e.g. @xcite , or corrections for cosmic ray deflections were applied using analytic magnetic field expressions reflecting the spiral structure of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "recently , parameterizations of the galactic magnetic field have been developed which are based on numerous measurements of faraday rotation @xcite , and in addition polarized synchrotron radiation for the second reference .",
    "based on directional characteristics and the field strength of the parameterizations , deflections of cosmic rays are predicted to depend strongly on their arrival direction , charge and energy . in the following",
    "we will refer to the regular field with the bisymmetric disk model of the first reference as the pt11 field parameterization , and to the regular field of the latter as the jf12 field parameterization , respectively .",
    "angular distributions of cosmic rays in these galactic field parameterizations have been studied before , e.g. , with respect to general properties of the jf12 parameterization @xcite , specific source candidates @xcite , general properties of deflections and magnifications @xcite , and to the potential of revealing correlations between cosmic rays and their sources @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate whether cosmic ray deflections in the galactic magnetic field can be reliably corrected for , given the current knowledge of the field . to simplify discussions of energy and nuclear dependencies",

    "we initially discuss key distributions of cosmic ray deflection , dispersion effects in arrival distributions , directional variance in field transparency , and the influence of random field components . from the rigidity dependencies of these distributions ,",
    "we recommend a minimum rigidity threshold above which cosmic ray deflection may be controlled in terms of probability distributions .",
    "furthermore , we take the different results of the two galactic field parameterizations as a measure of our current knowledge of the galactic field .",
    "we compare their cosmic ray angular deflections and study differences in the dispersion of arrival distributions .",
