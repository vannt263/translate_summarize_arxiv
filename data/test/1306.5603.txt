    "maximum likelihood estimation is a common , well - studied and powerful technique for statistical estimation . in the context of a statistical model with an unknown parameter ,",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown parameter is , by definition , any parameter value under which the observed data is most likely ; such parameter values are said to maximize the likelihood function with respect to the observed data .",
    "in classical statistical models , one typically thinks of the unknown parameter as a real number or possibly a finite dimensional vector of real numbers .",
    "here we consider maximum likelihood estimation for statistical models in which each parameter value corresponds to a stochastic system observed with noise .",
    "hidden markov models ( hmms ) provide a natural setting in which to study both stochastic systems with observational noise and maximum likelihood estimation . in this setting , one has a parametrized family of stochastic processes that are assumed to be markov , and one attempts to perform inference about the underlying parameters from noisy observations of the process .",
    "there has been a substantial amount of work on statistical inference for hmms , and we do not attempt a complete survey of that area here . in the 1960s ,",
    "baum and petrie @xcite studied consistency of maximum likelihood estimation for finite state hmms . since that time",
    ", several other authors have shown that maximum likelihood estimation is consistent for hmms under increasingly general conditions @xcite , culminating with the work of douc et al .",
    "@xcite , which currently provides the most general conditions on hmms under which maximum likelihood estimation has been shown to be consistent .",
    "we focus here on the consistency of maximum likelihood estimation for parametrized families of deterministic systems observed with noise .",
    "inference methods for deterministic systems from noisy observations are of interest in a variety of scientific areas ; for a few examples , see @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this article , the terms deterministic system and dynamical system refer to a map @xmath0 .",
    "the set @xmath1 is referred to as the state space , and the transformation @xmath2 governs the evolution of states over one ( discrete ) time increment .",
    "our main interest here lies in families of dynamical systems observed with noise .",
    "more precisely , we consider a state space @xmath1 and a parameter space @xmath3 , and to each @xmath4 in @xmath3 , we associate a dynamical system @xmath5 .",
    "note that the state space @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "for each @xmath4 in @xmath3 , we assume that the system is started at equilibrium from a @xmath6-invariant measure @xmath7 .",

    "we are particularly interested in situations in which the family of dynamical systems is observed via noisy measurements ( or observations ) .",
    "we consider a general observation model specified by a family of probability densities @xmath8 , where @xmath9 prescribes the distribution of an observation given that the state of the dynamical system is @xmath10 and the state of nature is  @xmath4 . under some additional conditions ( see section  [ generaltheorem ] ) , our first main result states that maximum likelihood estimation is a consistent method of estimation of the parameter  @xmath4 .    we have chosen to state the conditions of our main consistency result in terms of statistical properties of the family of dynamical systems and the observations .",
    "however , these particular statistical properties have not been directly studied in the dynamical systems literature . in the interest of applying our general result to specific systems",
    ", we also establish several connections between well - studied properties of dynamical systems and the statistical properties relevant to maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "finally , we apply these results to some examples , including shifts of finite type with gibbs measures and axiom  a attractors with srb ( sinai  ruelle ",
    "bowen ) measures .",
    "it is widely accepted in the field of ergodic theory and dynamical systems that these classes of systems have `` good '' statistical properties , and our results may be viewed as a precise confirmation of this view .      there has been a substantial amount of work on statistical inference for hmms , and a complete survey of that area is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the asymptotic consistency of maximum likelihood estimation for hmms has been studied at least since the work of baum and petrie @xcite under the assumption that both the hidden state space @xmath1 and the observation space @xmath11 are finite sets .",
    "leroux extended this result to the setting where @xmath11 is a general space and @xmath1 is a finite set @xcite .",

    "@xcite , which currently provides the most general conditions for hmms under which maximum likelihood estimation has been shown to be consistent .",

    "@xcite in greater detail .",
    "consider parametrized families of hmms in which both the hidden state space @xmath1 and the observation space @xmath11 are complete , separable metric spaces .",
    "the main result of @xcite shows that under several conditions , maximum likelihood estimation is a consistent method of estimation of the unknown parameter .",
    "these conditions involve some requirements on the transition kernel of the hidden markov chain , as well as basic integrability conditions on the observations .",
    "the proof of that result relies on information - theoretic arguments , in combination with the application of some mixing conditions that follow from the assumptions on the transition kernel . to prove our consistency result",
    ", we take a similar information - theoretic approach , but instead of placing explicit restrictions on the transition kernel , we identify and study mixing conditions suitable for dynamical systems .",
    "see remarks [ comparisonrmk ] and [ stochasticremark ] for further discussion of our results in the context of hmms .",
    "other directions of study regarding inference for hmms include the behavior of mle for misspecified hmms @xcite , asymptotic normality for parameter estimates @xcite , the dynamics of bayesian updating @xcite and starting the hidden process away from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "extending these results to dynamical systems is of potential interest .",
    "the topic of statistical inference for dynamical systems has been widely studied in a variety of fields .",

    "for a recent review of this area with many references , see @xcite",
    ". there has been significant methodological work in the area of statistical inference for dynamical systems ( for a few recent examples , see @xcite ) , but in this section we attempt to describe some of the more theoretical work in this area . the relevant theoretical work to date falls ( very ) roughly into three classes :    * state estimation ( also known as denoising or filtering ) for dynamical systems with observational noise ; * prediction for dynamical systems with observational noise ; * system reconstruction from dynamical systems without noise .",
    "let us now mention some representative works from these lines of research .    in the setting of dynamical systems with observational noise",
    ", lalley introduced several ideas regarding state estimation in @xcite .",
    "these ideas were subsequently generalized and developed in @xcite .",
    "key results from this line of study include both positive and negative results on the consistency of denoising a dynamical system under additive observational noise . in short",
    ", the magnitude of the support of the noise seems to determine whether consistent denoising is possible . in related work",
    ", judd @xcite demonstrated that mle can fail ( in a particular sense ) in state estimation when noise is large .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to note that there are examples of axiom  a systems with gaussian observational noise for which state estimation can not be consistent ( by results of @xcite ) and yet mle provides consistent parameter estimation ( by theorem  [ axiomathm ] ) .",
    "steinwart and anghel considered the problem of consistency in prediction accuracy for dynamical systems with observational noise @xcite .",
    "they were able to show that support vector machines are consistent in terms of prediction accuracy under some conditions on the decay of correlations of the dynamical system .",
    "the work of adams and nobel uses ideas from regression to study reconstruction of measure - preserving dynamical systems @xcite without noise .",
    "these results show that certain types of inference are possible under fairly mild ergodicity assumptions .",
    "a sample result from this line of work is that a measure - preserving transformation may be consistently reconstructed from a typical trajectory observed without noise , assuming that the transformation preserves a measure that is absolutely continuous ( with radon  nikodym derivative bounded away from @xmath12 and infinity ) with respect to a known reference measure .      in section  [ sectionassumptions ] , we give some necessary background on dynamical systems observed with noise . section  [ generaltheorem ] contains a statement and discussion of our main result ( theorem  [ mainthm ] ) , which asserts that under some general statistical conditions , maximum likelihood parameter estimation is consistent for of dynamical systems observed with noise . the purpose of section  [ sectionverification ] is to establish connections between well - studied properties of dynamical systems and the ( statistical ) conditions appearing in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "section  [ sectionexamples ] gives several examples of widely studied families of dynamical systems to which we apply theorem  [ mainthm ] and therefore establish consistency of maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the proofs of our main results appear in section  [ sectionproofs ] , and we conclude with some final remarks in section  [ sectionconclusion ] .",
    "recall that our primary objects of study are parametrized families of dynamical systems . in this section",
    "we introduce these objects in some detail .",
    "first let us recall some terminology regarding dynamical systems and ergodic theory .",
    "we use @xmath1 to denote a state space , which we assume to be a complete separable metric space endowed with its borel @xmath13-algebra @xmath14 .",
    "then a measurable dynamical system on @xmath1 is defined by a measurable map @xmath0 , which governs the evolution of states over one ( discrete ) time increment . for a probability measure @xmath15 on the measurable space @xmath16",
    ", we say that @xmath2 preserves @xmath15 ( or @xmath15 is @xmath2-invariant ) if @xmath17 for each set @xmath18 in @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to the quadruple @xmath19 as a measure - preserving system . to generate a trajectory @xmath20 from such a measure - preserving system",
    ", one chooses @xmath21 according to @xmath15 and sets @xmath22 for @xmath23 . note that @xmath20 is then a stationary @xmath1-valued stochastic process .",
    "finally , the measure - preserving system @xmath24 is said to be ergodic if @xmath25 implies @xmath26 . see the books @xcite for an introduction to measure - preserving systems and ergodic theory .",
    "let us now introduce the setting of parametrized families of dynamical systems .",
    "we denote the parameter space by @xmath3 , which is assumed to be a compact metric space endowed with its borel @xmath13-algebra .",
    "fix a state space @xmath1 and its borel @xmath13-algebra @xmath14 as above .",
    "to each parameter @xmath4 in @xmath3 , we associate a measurable transformation @xmath5 , which prescribes the dynamics corresponding to the parameter @xmath4 . finally , we need to specify some initial conditions . in this article , we consider the case that the system is started from equilibrium .",
    "more precisely , we associate to each @xmath4 in @xmath3 a @xmath6-invariant borel probability measure @xmath7 on @xmath27 . thus , to each @xmath4 in @xmath3 , we associate a measure - preserving system @xmath28 , and we refer to the collection @xmath29 as a parametrized family of dynamical systems . for ease of notation , we will refer to @xmath30 as a family of dynamical systems on @xmath27 , instead of referring to the family of quadruples @xmath31 .",
    "we would like to study the situation that such a family of dynamical systems is observed via noisy measurements . here",
    "we describe the specifics of our observation model .",
    "we suppose that we have a complete , separable metric space @xmath11 , endowed with its @xmath13-algebra @xmath32 , which serves as our observation space .",
    "we also assume that we have a family of borel probability densities @xmath33 with respect to a fixed reference measure @xmath34 on @xmath11 .",
    "the density @xmath35 prescribes the distribution of our observation given that the state of the dynamical system is @xmath10 and the state of nature is @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we assume that the noise involved in successive observations is conditionally independent given @xmath4 and the underlying trajectory of the dynamical system .",
    "thus our full model consists of a parametrized family of dynamical systems @xmath37 on a measurable space @xmath27 with corresponding observation densities @xmath38 .    in general , we would like to estimate the parameter @xmath4 from our observations .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation provides a basic method for performing such estimation .",
    "our first main result states that maximum likelihood estimation is a consistent estimator of @xmath4 under some general conditions on the family of systems and the noise . in order to state these results",
    "precisely , we now introduce the likelihood for our model . for the sake of notation",
    ", it will be convenient to denote finite sequences @xmath39 with the notation @xmath40 .",
    "as we have assumed that our observations are conditionally independent given @xmath4 and a trajectory @xmath20 , we have that for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the likelihood of observing @xmath43 given @xmath4 and @xmath20 is @xmath44 since @xmath45 given @xmath4 and @xmath21 , the conditional likelihood of @xmath43 given @xmath4 and @xmath46 is @xmath47 since our model also assumes that @xmath21 is distributed according to @xmath48 , we have that for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the marginal likelihood of observing @xmath43 given @xmath4 is @xmath51 we denote by @xmath52 the product measure on @xmath53 with marginals equal to @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the probability measure on @xmath55 such that for borel sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 , it holds that @xmath58 which is well defined by kolmogorov s consistency theorem .",
    "let @xmath59 denote expectation with respect to @xmath54 , and let @xmath60 be the marginal of @xmath54 on @xmath61 .    before we define consistency ,",
    "let us first consider the issue of identifiability .",
    "our notion of identifiability is captured by the following equivalence relation .",
    "define an equivalence relation on @xmath3 as follows : let @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "denote by @xmath64 $ ] the equivalence class of @xmath4 with respect to this equivalence relation .    in a strong theoretical sense , if @xmath65 is in @xmath66 $ ] , then the systems corresponding to the parameter values @xmath65 and @xmath4 can not be distinguished from each other based on observations of the system .",
    "now we fix a distinguished element @xmath67 in @xmath3 . here and in the rest of the paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath67 is the `` true '' parameter ; that is , the data are generated from the measure @xmath68 .",
    "hence , one may think of @xmath69 $ ] as the set of parameters that can not be distinguished from the true parameter .",
    "an approximate maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) is a sequence of measurable functions @xmath70 such that @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes a process that tends to zero @xmath73-a.s . as @xmath74 tends to infinity",
    "several notions in this article , including the definition of approximate mle above , involve taking suprema over @xmath4 in @xmath75 .",
    "in many situations of interest to us , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are compact , and all relevant functions are continuous in these arguments . in such cases , we have sufficient regularity to guarantee that suprema over @xmath4 in @xmath3 are measurable .",
    "however , in the general situation , such suprema are not guaranteed to be measurable , and one must take some care .",
    "as all our measurable spaces are polish ( complete , separable metric spaces ) ; such functions are always universally measurable @xcite , proposition  7.47 .",
    "similarly , a  borel - measurable ( approximate ) maximum likelihood estimator need not exist , but the polish assumption ensures the existence of universally measurable maximum likelihood estimators @xcite , proposition  7.50 .",
    "thus all probabilities and expectations may be unambiguously extended to such quantities .    in this work",
    ", we do not consider specific schemes for constructing an approximate mle .",
    "based on the existing results regarding denoising and system reconstruction ( e.g. , @xcite , which are briefly discussed in section  [ sectionpriorwork ] ) , explicit construction of an approximate mle may be possible under suitable conditions .",
    "although the description and study of such constructive methods could be interesting , it is outside of the scope of this work .    in principle",
    ", one could consider inference based on the conditional likelihood @xmath76 in place of the marginal likelihood @xmath77 .",
    "however , we do not pursue this direction in this work .",
    "for nonlinear dynamical systems , even the conditional likelihood @xmath76 may depend very sensitively on @xmath78 ; see  @xcite , for example .",
    "thus optimizing over @xmath78 is essentially no more `` tractable '' than marginalizing the likelihood via an invariant measure .",

    "if @xmath1 is uncountable , then the degeneracy of @xmath79 , which arises directly from the fact that we are considering deterministic systems , makes the existence of such a dominating measure impossible . in short ,",
    "it is precisely the determinism in our hidden processes that prevents previous theorems for hmms from applying to dynamical systems .",

    "as mentioned in the , our results can be considered as a theoretical validation of the notion from dynamical systems that these classes of systems have `` good '' statistical properties .",
    "however , there remain interesting families of systems to which our results do not apply , including some classes of systems that are also believed to have `` good '' statistical properties . in particular , the class of systems modeled by young towers with exponential tail @xcite has exponential decay of correlations and certain large deviations estimates @xcite .",
    "these families include a positive measure set of maps from the quadratic family [ @xmath335 and the hnon family , as well as certain billiards and many other systems of physical and mathematical interest @xcite . in short ,",
    "the setting of systems modeled by young towers with exponential tail provides a very attractive setting in which to consider consistency of maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "unfortunately , our proof does not apply to systems in this setting in general , mainly due to the presence of the mixing condition ( s5 ) , which is not satisfied by these systems in general .",
    "a natural next step might be to obtain rates of convergence and derive central limit theorems for maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "to this end , it might be possible to build off of analogous results for hmms @xcite .",
