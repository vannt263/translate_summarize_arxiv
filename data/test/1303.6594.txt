    "incident sun light couples very strongly to the metal nanoparticle plasmons . the trapped intense radiation results enhanced light - matters interaction @xcite .",
    "however , this oscillations last in only about @xmath132s and light is re - radiated in different frequencies ( heat ) .",
    "we show that the lifetime of the light trapping in plasmonic oscillations can be increased upto the quantum decay time @xmath133s .",
    "the dynamics of the driven plasmons is governed by the lifetime of the quantum emitter ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) which is coupled to it .",

    "the effect is observed in the experiment @xcite demonstrating the stimulated emission of plasmon excitations ( spaser ) . the emission band of the coupled metal nanoparticle ",
    "molecule system is determined by the internal conversion rate of the dye molecule .",
    "the presence of such an effect is due to the semiquantum ",
    "semiclassical analog of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the quantum object creates an additional oscillation mode whose frequency is within the uncertainty window ( proportional to the damping rate ) of the classical oscillator .",
    "the two normal modes of the classical oscillator interfere destructively and absorption cancels .",
    "a transparency window emerges at the center of the absorption peak of the plasmonic nanometal .",
    "a similar version of duration enhancement also occurs in the full - classical analog of eit @xcite , where a dipole mode is coupled to a high - life quadrupole mode @xcite .",
    "however , the lifetime of quantum excitation is highly large compared to the quadrupole mode plasmon lifetime .",
    "the eit in coupled classical  quantum systems enables us to benefit from useful features of both systems .",
    "in such a devise , one can combine large interaction cross section of plasmons ( with light ) and long decay time of the quantum object .",
    "this allows one to use nanoantennas in quantum information .",
    "such an effect can also be adopted in solar cell applications for longer trapping of light .",
    "in addition , the slow light propagation occurring within the transparency window last much longer . regarding the macroscopic light propagation inside the solar cell , this effect additionally increases the optical path length .",
