    "the physical mechanisms leading to subdiffusion in biological cells or other complex systems are varied . the anomalous diffusion of inert biopolymers larger than some 10kd in living cells is due to molecular crowding , these are excluded volume effects in the viscoelastic , superdense cellular environment @xcite .",

    "such trapping may give rise to a broad distribution of waiting times , as embodied in the ctrw model .",

    "de gennes reptation model of a polymer diffusing in a tube formed by foreign chains in a melt yields subdiffusion with @xmath228 , and was used as a possible explanation of the short time dynamics of telomere motion @xcite .    one may speculate whether the widely observed subdiffusion of biomolecules and passive tracers is a mere coincidence of nature that should be attributed to the dense environment in the cell and/or to the wide distribution of obstacles and reactions in the cell . or",
    ", maybe , subdiffusion is by itself a goal which was obtained via evolution ?",
    "there exist claims that sub - diffusion is useful in certain cellular search strategies @xcite .",
    "one may also view subdiffusion to be a sufficiently slow process to help maintaining the organisation of the genome in the nucleus of the cell without the need for physical compartments @xcite . since reactions in many cases are controlled by diffusion , the emergence of slower - than - normal diffusion has far - reaching implications to signalling and regulatory processes in the cell .",
    "the standard theories of diffusion - controlled reactions under such circumstances must be replaced by subdiffusion - controlled reaction models . while these issues are clearly important , we here focused more on the characterisation of trajectories of single particles in the cell , in particular , as a quantitative diagnosis method to probe the nature of the stochastic motion in cells and other complex media .",
    "single particle tracking microscopy is a widely used technique .",
    "it allows one to locally probe complex systems in the liquid phase _ in situ_. in particular it has become one of the standard tools in biophysical , colloidal , polymeric , and gel - like environments .",
    "the motion of tracers in these systems is often anomalous .",
    "typically the experimentally recorded time series are evaluated in terms of the time averaged mean squared displacement @xmath13 .",
    "here we collected the behaviour of @xmath229 for the two most prominent anomalous stochastic processes , the continuous time random walk and fractional brownian motion .",

    "no plateau value is observed as in the ensemble average , instead , a power - law of the form @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ conf_tamsd ] ) , is found .",
    "interestingly , this characteristic behaviour is approximately preserved when an appropriate cutoff in the waiting time is introduced .",
    "conversely the distribution of the time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble mean becomes almost gaussian in presence of the cutoff , while it has an exponential decay and a finite value at @xmath182 when the system is non - ergodic and exhibits ageing .",

    "the distribution of the time averaged mean squared displacement is approximately gaussian for short lag times .",
    "our analysis demonstrates how different the two stochastic processes are , despite sharing the same form of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement . at the same time",
    "the velocity autocorrelation of confined ctrw subdiffusion is hardly distinguishable from that of fbm subdiffusion .",
    "given a recorded time series of anomalous diffusion from experiment it is important to know more precisely which stochastic process is responsible for the observed behaviour , in particular , with respect to diffusion - limited reactions , general transport behaviour , and related processes such as gene regulation . the analysis presented here , along with complementary tools discussed in refs .",
