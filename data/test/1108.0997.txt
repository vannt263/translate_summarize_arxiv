    "for the last century astronomers have been modelling the structure of ` nebulae ' , and here we focus on those external to the milky way .",
    "a key activity performed by many astronomers , past and present , is the catergorisation of these galaxies ( sandage 2005 ) and the quantification of their physical properties .",
    "how big are they ?",
    "how bright are they ? what characteristics distinguish or unite apparent subpopulations ?",
    "answers to such questions , and the establishment of `` scaling relations '' between two or more galactic properties provides valuable insight into the physical mechanisms that have shaped galaxies .    understanding how galaxies form , increasingly through the use of simulations and semi - analytic modelling ( e.g.   cole 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann et al .",

    "not surprising , our knowledge of galaxies is best in the nearby universe  out to distances typically measured in megaparsecs rather than by redshift @xmath2  where galaxy structures can be reasonably well resolved .",
    "the properties of these galaxies provide the @xmath3 benchmark used in the calibration of galactic evolutionary studies  both observed and simulated .",
    "popular scaling relations involving global galaxy parameters such as size , surface brightness , luminosity and concentration are reviewed here .",
    "as we shall see , many bivariate distributions , which are frequently assumed to be linear , are often only approximately so over a restricted luminosity range .",
    "for example , it may come as a surprise for many too learn that the useful kormendy ( 1977b ) relation is only the tangent to the bright arm of a continuous but curved effective radius-(surface brightness ) relation which unifies dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies ( section  [ sec_korm ] ) . similarly , the faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation with a slope of 4 represents the average slope over a restricted luminosity range to what is a curved or broken luminosity-(velocity dispersion ) distribution , in which the slope is 2 rather than 4 at lower luminosities ( section  [ sec_faber ] ) . knowing these trends , the bulk of which can not be established when assuming structural homology , i.e.  using de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath4 model , is vital if one is to measure , model and make sense of galaxies .",
    "this article has been structured into four main sections .",
    "section 1 provides this general overview plus a further review and introduction to galaxies on the hubble - jeans sequence mag .",
    "these galaxies can not be observed ( to date ) at cosmologically interesting distances , and their increased scatter in the colour - magnitude relation may indicate a range of galaxy types ( e.g.  penny & conselice 2008 , and references therein ) . ] . included",
    "are diagrams showing the location of dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass - size and mass - density plane , revealing that some high-@xmath2 compact galaxies have properties equivalent to the bulges of local disc galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec_ell ] provides an historical account of how the radial distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies have been modelled , and the iterative steps leading to the development of the modern core - srsic model ( section  [ sec_cs ] ) .",
    "subsections cover the srsic model ( section  [ sec_body ] ) , its relation and applicability to dark matter halos ( section  [ sec_dark ] ) , partially - depleted galaxy cores ( section  [ sec_def ] ) , excess nuclear light ( section  [ sec_enuc ] ) and excess light at large radii in the form of halos or envelopes around giant elliptical galaxies ( section  [ sec_cd ] ) . section  [ sec_e ] presents and derives a number of elliptical galaxy scaling relations pertaining to the main body of the galaxy . from just two linear relations which unite the faint and bright elliptical galaxy population ( section  [ sec_line ] ) , a number of curved relations are derived ( section  [ sec_curved ] ) . several broken relations , at @xmath5 mag , are additionally presented in section  [ sec_bent ] . for those interested in a broader or different overview of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "some recent good reviews include renzini ( 2006 ) , cecil & rose ( 2007 ) , ciotti ( 2009 ) and lisker ( 2009 ) .",
    "finally , the latter third of this paper is tied up in section  [ sec_discs ] which contains a discussion of the light profiles of disc galaxies and their bulge - disc decomposition ( [ sec_bd ] ) .",
    "also included are subsections pertaining to dust ( section  [ sec_dust ] ) , the difficulties with identifying pseudobulges ( section  [ sec_pseudo ] ) , potential bulgeless galaxies ( section  [ sec_less ] ) and methods to model bars ( section  [ sec_bar ] ) . throughout the article references to often overlooked discovery or pioneer papers are provided .      looking out into the milky way arced across our night sky , the notion that we are residents within a pancake - shaped galaxy seems reasonable to embrace .",
    "indeed , back in 1750 thomas wright also conjectured that we reside within a flat layer of stars which is gravitationally bound and rotating about some centre of mass . however , analogous to the rings of saturn , he entertained the idea that the milky way is comprised of a large annulus of stars rotating about a distant centre , or that we are located in a large thin spherical shell rotating about some divine centre ( one of the galactic poles ) . while he had the global geometry wrong , he was perhaps the first to speculate that faint , extended nebulae in the heavens are distant galaxies with their own ( divine ) centers .",
    "as elucidated by hoskin ( 1970 ) , it was immanuel kant ( 1755 ) , aware of the elliptically - shaped nebulae observed by maupertuis , and working from an incomplete summary of wright ( 1750 ) that had been published in a hamburg journal , who effectively introduced the modern concept of disc - like galactic distributions of stars  mistakenly crediting wright for the idea .    using his 1.83 m `` leviathan of parsonstown '' metal reflector telescope in ireland , lord william henry parsons , the 3rd earl of rosse , discovered 226 new general catalogue ( ngc : dreyer 1888 ) and 7 index catalogue ( ic : dreyer 1895 , 1908 ) objects ( parsons 1878 ) .",
    "important among these was his detection of spiral structure in many galaxies , such as m51 which affectionately became known as the whirlpool galaxy .",
    "further divisions into disc ( spiral ) and elliptical galaxy types followed ( e.g.  wolf 1908 ; knox shaw 1915 ; curtis 1918 ; reynolds 1920 ; hubble 1926 ) and shapley & swope ( 1924 ) and shapley ( 1928 ) successfully identified our own galaxy s ( gravitational ) center towards the constellation sagittarius ( see also seares 1928 ) .    with the discovery that our universe contains doppler shifted nebulae that are expanding away from us",
    "( de sitter 1917 ; slipher 1917 ; see also friedmann 1922 , lundmark 1924 and the reviews by kragh & smith 2003 and shaviv 2011 ) , in accord with a redshift - distance relation ( lemaitre 1927 , robertson 1928 , humasson 1929 , hubble 1929 )  i.e.  awareness that some of the `` nebuale '' are external objects to our galaxy  came increased efforts to catergorise and organise these different types of `` galaxy '' . as noted by sandage ( 2004 , 2005 ) , sir james jeans ( 1928 ) was the first to present the ( tuning fork)-shaped diagram that encapsulated hubble s ( 1926 ) early - to - late type galaxy sequence , a sequence which had been inspired in part by jeans ( 1919 ) and later popularised by hubble ( 1936a",
    "; see block et al.2004 )",
    ". quantifying the physical properties of galaxies along this sequence , with increasing accuracy and level of detail , has occupied many astronomers since .",
    "indeed , this review addresses aspects related to the radial concentration of stars in the elliptical and disc galaxies which effectively define the hubble - jeans sequence .",
    "irregular galaxies are not discussed here .      for reasons that will become apparent",
    ", this review uses the galaxy notation of alan sandage and bruno binggeli , in which dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are the faint extension of ordinary and luminous elliptical ( e ) galaxies , and the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies  prevalent in our local group ( grebel 2001 )  are found at magnitudes fainter than @xmath6 to @xmath714 mag ( @xmath8 in stellar mass ; see figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a reveals a second branch of elliptically - shaped object stretching from the bulges of disc galaxies and compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies to ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) objects ( hilker et al .",
    "1999 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2000 ; norris & kannappan 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "a _ possible _ connection is based upon the stripping of a disc galaxy s outer disc to form a ce galaxy ( nieto 1990 ; bekki et al .",
    "2001b ; graham 2002 ; chilingarian et al .  2009 ) and through greater stripping of the bulge to form a ucd ( zinnecker et al .",
    "1988 ; freeman 1990 ; bassino et al .",
    "1994 ; bekki 2001a ) .",
    "it is thought that nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies may also experience this stripping process , giving rise to ucds .",
    "while the identification of local spiral galaxies is relatively free from debate , the situation is not so clear in regard to elliptically - shaped galaxies .",
    "the discovery of ucds , which have sizes and fluxes intermediate between those of galaxies and ( i ) the nuclear star clusters found at the centres of galaxies and ( ii ) globular clusters ( gcs : e.g.  haegan et al .",
    "2005 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) , led forbes & kroupa ( 2011 ) to try and provide a modern definition for what is a galaxy ( see also tollerud et al.2011 ) .",
    "only a few years ago there was something of a divide between gcs and ucds  all of which had sizes less than @xmath930 pc  and galaxies with sizes greater than  120 pc ( gilmore et al .  2007 ) .",
    "however , as we have steadily increased our celestial inventory , objects of an intermediate nature have been found ( e.g.  ma et al .",
    "2007 , their table  3 ) , raising the question asked by forbes & kroupa for which , perhaps not surprisingly , no clear answer has yet emerged . while those authors explored the notion of a division by , among other properties , size and luminosity , they did not discuss how the density varies . as an addendum of sorts to forbes & kroupa ( 2011 ) ,",
    "the density of elliptically - shaped objects is presented here in figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "this is also done to allow the author to wave the following flag .",
    "apparent in figure  [ fig1]b , but apparently not well recognised within the community , is that the bulges of disc galaxies can be much denser than elliptical galaxies . if the common idea of galaxy growth via the accretion of a disc , perhaps from cold - mode accretion streams , around a pre - existing spheroid is correct ( e.g.navarro & benz 1991 ; steinmetz & navarro 2002 ; birnboim & dekel 2003 ; see also conselice et al .  2011 and pichon et al .  2011 )",
    ", then one should expect to find dense spheroids at high-@xmath2 with @xmath10@xmath11 of stellar material , possibly surrounded by a faint ( exponential ) disc which is under development .",
    "it is noted here that the dense , compact early - type galaxies recently found at redshifts of 1.4 - 2.5 ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) display substantial overlap with the location of present day bulges in figure  [ fig1]a , and that the merger scenarios for converting these compact high-@xmath2 galaxies into today s elliptical galaxies are not without problems ( e.g.  nipoti et al .",
    "2009 ; nair et al .  2011 ) .",
    "it is also noted that well - developed discs and disc galaxies are rare at the redshifts where these compact objects have been observed alongside normal - sized elliptical galaxies . before trying to understand galaxy structure at high - redshift , and galaxy evolution  themes not detailed in this review  it is important to first appreciate galaxy structures at @xmath3 where observations are easier and local benchmark scaling relations have been established .",
    "over the years a number of mathematical functions have been used to represent the radial distribution of stellar light in elliptical galaxies , i.e.  their light profiles . before getting to de vaucouleurs @xmath4 model in the following paragraph",
    ", it seems apt to first quickly mention some early competitors .",
    "although plummer s ( 1911 ) internal - density model was developed for the nebulae which became know as globular clusters , because of its simplicity it is still used today by some researchers to simulate elliptical galaxies , even though , it should be noted , no modern observers use this model to describe the radial distribution of light in elliptical galaxies .",
    "reynold s ( 1913 ) surface - density model , sometimes referred to as hubble s ( 1930 ) model or the reynold - hubble model , was used to describe the nebula which became known as elliptical galaxies .",
    "it has an infinite mass and is also no longer used by observers today . the modified hubble model ( rood et al .  1972 ) , which also has an infinite mass , is also still sometimes used by simulators , even though , again , observers do not use this model anymore .",
    "oemler s ( 1976 ) exponentially - truncated hubble model , known as the oemler - hubble model , is also not used to represent the observed stellar distribution in elliptical galaxies because it too , like its predecessors , was simply an approximation applicable over a limited radial range , as noted by king ( 1978 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that up until the 1980s , departures at large radii from the reynold s model were attributed to tidal - stripping by external gravitational potentials .",
    "that is , for three quarters of a century , reynold s model  originally developed from low - quality data for one galaxy  was generally thought to describe the original , undisturbed stellar distribution in elliptical galaxies .    de vaucouleurs ( 1948 , 1953 ) @xmath4 surface - density model had traction for many years , in part due to de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) arguing that it fits better than the reynold s model used by hubble ,  a point re - iterated by kormendy ( 1977a ) and others  and the revelation that it fits the radially - extended data for ngc  3379 exceedingly well ( de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) .",
    "hodge ( 1961a , b ) had however revealed that de vaucouleurs model was inadequate to describe faint elliptical galaxies and hodge ( 1963 , 1964 ) , in addition to king ( 1962 ) , noted that the 3-parameter king model , with its flatter inner profile and steeper decline at large radii , did a better job . for a time , king s ( 1962 , 1966 ) model became popular for describing the light distribution in faint elliptical galaxies , at least until the exponential model  also used for the discs of spiral galaxies  was noted to provide a good description of some dwarf elliptical galaxies ( hodge 1971 ; faber & lin 1983 ; binggeli et al .",
    "1984 ) and that these galaxies need not have experienced any tidal truncation ( a prescription of the king model with its tidal radius parameter ) .",
    "lauer ( 1984 , 1985 ) additionally showed that king s modified isothermal model , with its flat inner core , was inadequate to describe the deconvolved light - profiles of ordinary elliptical galaxies with `` cores '' , i.e.  galaxies whose inner light profile displays a nearly flat core .",
    "king s model does however remain extremely useful for studies of star clusters , globular clusters , dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galactic satellites which , unlike ordinary elliptical galaxies , can have flat cores in their inner surface brightness profile .    today",
    ", the model of choice for describing nearby ( and distant ) dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies is srsic s ( 1963 ) generalisation of de vaucouleurs @xmath4 model to give the @xmath12 surface - density model ( section  [ sec_body ] ) .",
    "this model reproduces the exponential model when @xmath13 and de vaucouleurs model when @xmath14 ; it can thus describe the main body of faint and luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "the key advantage that this model has is ( i ) its ability to describe the observed stellar distributions that have a range of central concentrations ( known to exist since at least reaves 1956 ) and ( ii ) it provides a very good description of the data over ( almost ) the entire radial extent .",
    "indeed , departures in the light profile from a well - fit srsic s model invariably signal the presence of additional features or components , rather than any failing of the model . expanding upon the srsic model , the core - srsic model ( section  [ sec_cs ] )",
    "is nowadays used to quantify those galaxies with `` cores '' .",
    "although referring to the king model , the following quote from king ( 1966 ) seems particularly insightful `` ... de vaucouleurs law appears to refer to a particular central concentration and should be appropriate only for galaxy profiles that have that concentration . ''",
    "while noted by others , such as oemler ( 1976 ) , capaccioli ( 1985 ) , michard ( 1985 ) and schombert ( 1986 ) , some three decades elapsed before the relevance of king s remark to elliptical galaxies re - surfaced  albeit slowly at first  in the 1990s .",
    "indeed , de vaucouleurs useful , albeit limited , @xmath4 model was referred to as a `` law '' for nearly half a century .",
    "however we are now more keenly aware that ( even normal ) elliptical galaxies possess a range of central concentrations : concentrations which are well quantified in terms of the exponent @xmath15 in srsic s @xmath12 model ( see trujillo , graham & caon 2001 ; graham , trujillo & caon 2001 ) .",
    "although , it should be confessed that one can still encounter papers which use @xmath4 model parameters alongside some model - independent measure of galaxy concentration , unaware of the inconsistency arising from the fact that every @xmath4 model actually has exactly the same level of concentration .    before introducing the equation for srsic s model in the following section ,",
    "it is pointed out that in addition to modelling what can be considered the main body of the galaxy , one can also find excess stellar light at ( i ) small radii in the form of nuclear ( i.e. centrally located ) discs and dense nuclear star clusters ( section  [ sec_enuc ] ) and also at ( ii ) large radii in the form of halos or envelopes in cd and central cluster galaxies ( section  [ sec_cd ] ) . as briefly noted above , deficits of stellar flux at the cores of massive galaxies",
    "are also observed , and a model to quantify these stellar distribution , relative to the outer non - depleted light profile , is described in section  [ sec_cs ] . while non - symmetrical components in elliptical galaxies can also exist , they are not addressed here given the focus on well - structured systems .",
    "somewhat random , non - symmetrical components may be a sign of a disturbed morphology ( see e.bartons chapter in this volume ) , of on - going non - uniform star formation ( see s.boissiers chapter in this volume ) or gravitationally - induced tidal features from external forces .",
    "jos srsic s ( 1963 , 1968 ) @xmath12 model , which was introduced in spanish , describes how the projected surface - intensity @xmath16 varies with the projected radius @xmath17 , such that @xmath18\\right\\ }   \\label{eq_ser}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 is the intensity at the ` effective ' radius @xmath20 that encloses half of the total light from the model ( ciotti 1991 ; caon et al .",
    "the term @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 , capaccioli 1989 ) is not a parameter but is instead dependent on the third model parameter , @xmath15 , that describes the shape , i.e.  the concentration , of the light profile .",
    "the exact value of @xmath21 is obtained by solving the equation @xmath24 where @xmath25(2n , x ) is the incomplete gamma function and @xmath26 is the ( complete ) gamma function ( ciotti 1991 ) .",
    "useful srsic related expressions have been presented in ciotti ( 1991 ) , simonneau & prada ( 2004 ) and ciotti & bertin ( 1999 ) , while graham & driver ( 2005 ) provide a detailed review of srsic s model plus associated quantities and references to pioneers of this model .",
    "the relation between the effective surface brightness ( @xmath27 ) and the central surface brightness ( @xmath28 ) is given by the expression @xmath29 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath15 from the term @xmath21 for simplicity , while @xmath30 \\label{eq_mue - mue}\\ ] ] gives the difference between the effective surface brightness and the mean effective surface brightness ( @xmath31 ) within @xmath20 .",

    "( 1990 , 1993 , 1994 ) revealed that the srsic @xmath12 model provided a remarkably good description to the stellar distribution over a large radial range , down to surface brightnesses of @xmath928 @xmath32-mag arcsec@xmath33 , for the early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath34 mag in the virgo cluster .",
    "this work was in essence an expansion of de vaucouleurs & capaccioli s ( 1979 ) study of ngc  3379 which is very well - fit with @xmath14 .",
    "different galaxies were discovered by caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to be equally well fit , but required different values of @xmath15 ( see also bertin et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "importantly , caon et al .  ( 1993 ) additionally showed that a correlation existed between stellar concentration , i.e.  the srsic index @xmath15 , and ( model - independent ) galaxy size that was not due to parameter coupling in the srsic model ( see also trujillo et al .",
    "2001 , their section  2 ) .",
    "one of the commonly overlooked implications of this result is that @xmath4 , and similarly petrosian ( 1976 ) , magnitudes , sizes and surface brightnesses are systematically in error as a function of galaxy concentration ( graham et al .",
    "2005 ; hill et al .",
    "that is , application of a model which fails to adequately capture the range of stellar distributions will result in parameters which are systematically biased as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "for example , fitting an @xmath4 model to elliptical galaxies which are actually described by an @xmath12 model with @xmath15 less than and greater than 4 will yield sizes and luminosities which are , respectively , greater than and less than the true value ( e.g.  binggeli & cameron 1991 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2001 ; brown et al .",
    "similarly , fitting an exponential model to bulges that are best described by an @xmath12 model with @xmath15 less than and greater than 1 will yield sizes and luminosities which are , respectively , greater than and less than the true value ( e.g.  graham 2001 )",
    ". obviously one does not want to fine tune their galaxy simulations to match scaling relations that contain systematic biases due to poor measurements , and observers are therefore busy fitting @xmath12 models these days .",
    "a good approximation to the internal - density profile associated with srsic s model , i.e.  with its deprojection , was introduced by prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) .",
    "useful expressions for the dynamics , gravitational potential and forces of this model have been developed by trujillo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , terzi & graham ( 2005 ) and terzi & sprague ( 2007 ) .",
    "somewhat more complex than the early light - profile models , such expressions can , importantly , accommodate a range of concentrations , rather than only varying one scale radius and one scale density .",
    "such a model is vital if one wishes to properly simulate and understand the mass spectrum of elliptical galaxies , whose srsic index @xmath15 increases with stellar mass . while graham & driver s ( 2005 ) review stated that `` no attempt has been made here to show the numerous scientific advances engendered via application of the @xmath12 model '' , this article reveals how srsic s model , and the core - srsic model 0 ( subsection  [ sec_cs ] ) ,",
    "have become key in unifying and understanding the galaxies around us .",
    "like the majority of surface- and internal - density models from the last century , the srsic function is an empirical model created to match data rather than developed from theory , and as such we should be cautious before calling it a law .",
    "attempts to find a physical explanation for de vaucouleurs model yielded results which helped to keep it in vogue .",
    "dissipational models have long been touted for producing @xmath4 profiles ( e.g.  larson 1969 , 1974 ) , and in the 1980s papers based on dissipationless n - body simulations of a cold clumpy collapse or the merger of disc galaxies also claimed to finally produce @xmath4 ( and also reynold ) profiles ( e.g.van albada 1982 ; mcglynn 1984 ; carlberg et al .  1986 ; barnes 1988 ) .",
    "however a closer inspection reveals clear departures from the @xmath4 profile , with the simulated profiles better described by an @xmath12 model with @xmath35 .",
    "obviously their inability ( or perhaps lack of desire , although see farouki , shapiro & duncan 1983 whose non - homologous merger remnants were initially criticised by @xmath4 aficionados ) to create the range of stellar concentrations now observed in elliptical galaxies highlights a limitation of these early works . nonetheless , these pioneering studies have led to n - body simulations by nipoti et al .  ( 2006 ) and aceves et al .  ( 2006 )  and farouki et al .  ( 1983 ) , whose results with a smaller force softening appeared years ahead of their time  have now recovered a range of srsic profile shapes for gravitational collapses in a dark matter halo and for disc galaxy mergers , respectively .",
    "given the empirical nature of srsic s @xmath12 model , hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) revealed how dissipationless merging and violent relaxation provided a physical explanation for the departure from the homologous @xmath4 model .",
    "other works have explained how the quasi - constant specific entropy associated with the post violent - relaxation stage of elliptical galaxies results in the observed mass - dependent range of stellar concentrations in elliptical galaxies ( gerbal et al .",
    "1997 ; lima neto 1999 ; mrquez et al .",
    ".    it does not seem too unreasonable to speculate that elliptical galaxies , whether built by near - monolithic collapse , collisions of disc galaxies , wet or dry mergers , appear to eventually experience the same force(s ) of nature that results in their radial stellar distribution depending on the total stellar mass .",
    "that is , it may not matter how the mass was accumulated into an elliptical galaxy , once it becomes a dynamically - heated , bound stellar - system , it appears to eventually obey certain universal scaling relations ( see section  [ sec_e ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that srsic actually introduced his model as a way to parameterise disc galaxies which he thought were comprised of differing ratios of a disc plus an @xmath4-bulge .",
    "his model was not initially intended to fit elliptical galaxies , and as such it did not immediately threaten de vaucouleurs model .",
    "credit for popularising the use of srsic s @xmath12 model for approximating not only lenticular bulge@xmath36disc galaxies but for describing pure elliptical galaxies resides largely with massimo capaccioli ( e.g.  capaccioli 1985 , 1987 , 1989 ; caon et al .  1993 ; donofrio et al.1994)-bulge plus an exponential disc ( see section  [ sec_discs ] . ] .",
    "however , davies et al .",
    "( 1988 ) had also introduced this model for dwarf elliptical galaxies , while sparks ( 1988 ) developed an early gaussian seeing correction for this model , and ciotti ( 1991 ) developed a number of associated expressions such as the velocity dispersion profile and a distribution function .",
    "the important quantification that capaccioli and others provided is how the radial distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies , i.e.  their concentration , varies with the size , luminosity and thus the mass of the elliptical galaxy ( see also cellone , forte , & geisler 1994 ; vennik & richter 1994 ; young & currie 1994 , 1995 ; graham et al .",

    "as we shall see in this article , the implications of this breakthrough have been dramatic , unifying what had previously been considered two distinct species of galaxy , namely dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies , previously thought to be described by an exponential and @xmath4 model , respectively .",
    "this review would be somewhat incomplete without a few words regarding the connection between srsic s model and ( simulated ) dark matter halos . while modified theories of gravity may yet make dark matter redundant at some level , it is intriguing to note that the prugniel - simien ( 1997 ) internal - density model , developed to approximate the deprojected form of srsic s @xmath12 model , additionally provides a very good representation of the internal - density profiles of simulated dark matter halos .",
    "merritt et al.(2006 ) revealed that it actually provides a better description than not only the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) model but even a generalised nfw model with an arbitrary inner profile slope @xmath37 .",

    "although king ( 1978 ) identified a number of galaxies thought to be well described by his model , using seeing - deconvolved ground - based images , lauer ( 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ) analysed 14 galaxies with cores , ranging from 1.55.0 arcseconds in radius , revealing that they , like m87 ( young et al .",

    "there are three distinct types of ( two - parameter ) relations involving the properties of elliptical galaxies : ( i ) linear relations which are taken to reveal the unified nature of des and es ; ( ii ) curved relations revealing a continuity that had in the past been mis - interpreted to indicate that distinct formation process must be operating ; and ( iii ) broken relations which imply that two physical mechanisms are operating . in the following sections we shall learn how the linear relations result in the existence of curved relations when using effective radii and surface brightnesses .",
    "we shall also see that the transition in the broken relations occurs at @xmath64 mag and thus has nothing to do with the previously held belief that des and es are two distinct species separated at @xmath61 mag ( wirth & gallager 1984 ; kormendy 1985b , 2009 ) .",

    "<S> a century ago , in 1911 and 1913 , plummer and then reynolds introduced their models to describe the radial distribution of stars in ` nebulae ' . </S>",
    "<S> this article reviews the progress since then , providing both an historical perspective and a contemporary review of the stellar structure of bulges , discs and elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the quantification of galaxy nuclei , such as central mass deficits and excess nuclear light , plus the structure of dark matter halos and cd galaxy envelopes , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> issues pertaining to spiral galaxies including dust , bulge - to - disc ratios , bulgeless galaxies , bars and the identification of pseudobulges are also reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> an array of modern scaling relations involving sizes , luminosities , surface brightnesses and stellar concentrations are presented , many of which are shown to be curved . these ` redshift zero ' relations not only quantify the behavior and nature of galaxies in the universe today , but are the modern benchmark for evolutionary studies of galaxies , whether based on observations , @xmath0-body - simulations or semi - analytical modelling . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is shown that some of the recently discovered compact elliptical galaxies at @xmath1 may be the bulges of modern disc galaxies . </S>"
