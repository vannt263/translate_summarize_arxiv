    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "firstly , we study here the effect of introducing small pressure perturbations in an otherwise pressure - free gravitational collapse which was to terminate in a black hole final state .",
    "for such a purpose , spherically symmetric models of black hole and naked singularity formation for a general matter field are considered , which undergo a complete gravitational collapse under reasonable physical conditions while satisfying suitable energy conditions .",
    "secondly , we investigate the genericity and stability aspects of the occurrence of naked singularities and black holes as collapse endstates .",
    "the analysis of pressure perturbations in known collapse models , inhomogeneous but otherwise pressure - free , shows how collapse final states in terms of black hole or naked singularity are affected and altered .",
    "this allows us to examine in general how generic these outcomes are and we study in the initial data space the set of conditions that lead the collapse to a naked singularity and investigate how ` abundant ' these are .",
    "while it is known now for some time that both black holes and naked singularities do arise as collapse endstates under reasonable physical conditions , this helps us understand and analyze in a clear manner the genericity aspects of occurrence of these objects in a complete gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud in general relativity .",
    "the physics that is accepted today as the backbone of the general mechanism describing the formation of black holes as the endstate of collapse relies on the very simple and widely studied oppenheimer - snyder - datt ( osd ) dust model , which describes the collapse of a spherical cloud of homogeneous dust @xcite , @xcite . in the osd case , all matter falls into the singularity at the same comoving time while an horizon forms earlier than the singularity , thus covering it .",
    "a black hole results as the endstate of collapse .",
    "still , homogeneous dust is a highly idealized and unphysical model of matter .",
    "taking into account inhomogeneities in the initial density profile it is possible to show that the behaviour of the horizon can change drastically , thus leaving two different outcomes as the possible result of generic dust collapse : the black hole , in which the horizon forms at a time anteceding the singularity , and the naked singularity , in which the horizon is delayed thus allowing null geodesics to escape the central singularity where the density and curvatures diverge , to reach faraway observers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is known now that naked singularities do arise as a general feature in general relativity under a wide variety of circumstances .",
    "many examples of singular spacetimes can be found , but their relevance in models describing physically viable scenarios has been a matter of much debate since the first formulation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) @xcite . in particular , the formation of naked singularities in dynamical collapse solutions of einstein field equations remains a much discussed problem of contemporary relativity .",
    "the cch , which states that any singularity occurring in the universe must be hidden within an event horizon and therefore not visible to faraway observers , has remained at the stage of a conjecture for more than four decades now .",
    "this is also because of the difficulties lying in a concrete and definitive formulation of the conjecture itself . while no proof or any mathematically rigorous formulation of the same exists in the context of dynamical gravitational collapse ( while some proofs exist for particular classes of spacetimes that do not describe gravitational collapse , as in @xcite and @xcite ) , many counterexamples have been found over the past couple of decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "many of these collapse scenarios are restricted by some simplifying assumptions such as the absence of pressures ( dust models ) or the presence of only tangential pressures @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the pressures can not be neglected in realistic models describing stars in equilibrium .",
    "it seems natural therefore that if one wishes to study analytically what happens during the last stages of the life of a massive star , when its core collapses under its own gravity thus forming a compact object as a remnant , pressures must be taken into account .",
    "therefore , further to early works that showed the occurrence of naked singularities in dust collapse , much effort has been devoted to understanding the role played by pressures @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the presence of pressures is a crucial element towards the description of realistic sources as we know that stars and compact objects are generally sustained by matter with strong stresses ( either isotropic or anisotropic ) .",
    "at first it was believed that the naked singularity scenario could be removed by the introduction of pressures , thus implying that more realistic matter models would lead only to the formation of a black hole .",
    "we now know that this is not the case .",
    "the final outcome of collapse with pressure is entirely decided by its initial configuration and allowed dynamical evolutions and it can be either a black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "furthermore it is now clear that within spherical collapse models ( be it dust , tangential pressure or others ) the data set leading to naked singularities is not a subset of ` zero measure ' of the set of all possible initial data .    despite all this work we can still say that much more is to be understood about the role that general pressures play during the final stages of collapse .",
    "perfect fluid collapse has been studied mostly under some simplifying assumptions and restrictions in order to gain an understanding , but a general formalism for perfect fluids described by a physically valid equation of state is still lacking due to the intrinsic difficulties arising from einstein equations . considering both radial and tangential pressures",
    "is a fundamental step in order to better understand what happens in the ultra - dense regions that forms at the center of the collapsing cloud prior to the formation of the singularity .",
    "for this reason , perfect fluids appear as a natural choice since these are the models that are commonly used to describe gravitating stars in equilibrium and since it can be shown that near the center of the cloud regularity implies that matter must behave like a perfect fluid .    in the present paper",
    "we use a general formalism to analyze the structure of collapse in the presence of perfect fluid pressures .",
    "this helps to understand better realistic collapse scenarios and their outcomes and brings out clearly the role played by pressures towards the formation of black holes or naked singularities as the endstate of collapse .",
    "we examine what are the key features that determine the final outcome of collapse in terms of a black hole or a naked singularity when perfect fluids , without any restriction imposed by the choice of an equation of state , are considered .",
    "the reason we do not assume an explicit equation of state here is that the behavior of matter in ultra - dense states in the final stages of collapse is unknown . on the other hand",
    ", having regularity and energy conditions satisfied provides a physically reasonable framework to study collapse endstates .",
    "we find that not only naked singularities are not ruled out in perfect fluid collapse scenarios but also that the separation between the black hole region and the naked singularity region in the space of all possible evolutions has some interesting features . in particular , we show that the introduction of small pressures can drastically change the final fate of the well - known pressureless models .",
    "for example , we see that adding a small pressure perturbation to an inhomogeneous dust model leading to a black hole can be enough to change the outcome of collapse to a naked singularity , and viceversa .",
    "further to this , we investigate here the space of initial data and collapse evolutions in generality , in order to examine the genericity of naked singularities in collapse .",
    "to study small pressure perturbations as well as the genericity and stability aspects , we use the general formalism for spherically symmetric collapse developed earlier @xcite , @xcite in order to address the basic problem of how generic is a given collapse scenario which leads to the formation of naked singularities . given the existence of an increasing number of models describing collapse leading to a naked singularity , the issue of genericity and stability of such models in the space of initial data has become the crucial ingredient in order to decide whether the cosmic censorship hypothesis in its present form should be conserved , modified or dropped altogether .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the concepts such as genericity and stability are far from well - defined in a unique manner in general relativity , as opposed to the newtonian gravity . a major difficulty towards such a task is the non - uniqueness of topology , or the concept of ` nearness ' itself in a given spacetime geometry @xcite .",
    "one could define topology on a space of spacetime metrics by requiring that the metric component values are ` nearby ' or also additionally requiring that their @xmath0-th derivatives are also nearby , and in each case the resulting topologies will be different .",
    "this is in fact connected in a way with the basic problem in arriving at a well - formulated statement of the cosmic censorship itself .",
    "there have been attempts in the past to examine the genericity and stability of naked singularities in special cases .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was shown that for certain classes of massless scalar field collapse the initial data leading to naked singularity has , in a certain sense , a positive codimension , and so the occurrence of naked singularity is unstable in that sense .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in @xcite , @xcite that naked singularity occurrence is stable in the sense of the data sets leading to the same being open in the space of initial data . but these need not be dense in this space and so ` non - generic ' if we use the definition of ` genericity ' in the sense given in the dynamical systems theory ( where a set of initial data leading to a certain outcome is said to be generic if it is open and dense within the set of all initial data ) . in that case , however , both black hole and naked singularity final states turn out to be ` non - generic ' .",
    "therefore , in the following we adopt a more physical definition of ` genericity ' in the sense of ` abundance ' , and we call generic an initial data set that has a non - zero measure , and which is open ( though not necessarily dense ) in the set of all initial data . with this definition , the results obtained in @xcite and @xcite would mean that both black hole and naked singularity are generic collapse endstates .",
    "we note that we do not deal here with the self - similar models , or scalar fields , which is a somewhat special case .",
    "therefore , the issue of genericity and stability of naked singularities in collapse remains wide open , for spherically symmetric as well as non - spherical models and for different forms of matter fields .",
    "our consideration here treats in this respect a wide variety of physically reasonable matter fields for spherically symmetric gravitational collapse .    in section [ einstein ] , the general structure for einstein equations to study spherical collapse is reviewed and we describe how the equations can be integrated thus obtaining the equation of motion for the system . in section [ perturbation ] we examine the structure of the initial data sets of collapse leading to black hole and naked singularity to gain an insight on genericity of such outcomes for some special models and effect of introducing small pressure perturbations is investigated .",
    "section [ genericity ] then considers the genericity aspects of the outcomes of collapse with respect to initial data sets .",
    "we prove that the initial data sets leading to black holes and naked singularities in the space of all initial data sets for perfect fluid collapse are both generic .",
    "section [ eos ] is devoted to a brief discussion on equations of state .",
    "finally , in section [ remarks ] we outline the key features of the above approach and its advantages , and point to possible future uses of the same for astrophysical and numerical applications .",
    "in this section we summarize and review the key features on spherical gravitational collapse analysis , and also reformulate some of the key quantities and equations , especially those relating to the nature and behaviour of the final singularity curve",
    ". this will be useful in a later section in analyzing the small pressure perturbations in a given collapse scenario , and subsequently towards a general analysis of the genericity aspects of the occurrence of naked singularities and black holes as collapse final states .",
    "the regularity conditions and energy conditions that give physically reasonable models are discussed here .",
    "the final stages of collapse are discussed , evaluating key elements that determine when the outcome will be a black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "we shall find a function , related to the tangent of outgoing geodesics at the singularity whose sign solely determines the time of formation of trapped surfaces in relation with the time of formation of the singularity .",
    "we also analyze here the occurrence of trapped surfaces during collapse and the possibility that radial null geodesics do escape thus making it visible .",
    "we see how both features are related to the sign of the above mentioned function , thus obtaining a necessary and sufficient condition for the visibility of the singularity .",
    "the most general spacetime describing a spherically symmetric collapsing cloud in comoving coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 depends upon three functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and takes the form , @xmath6 the energy momentum tensor reads , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy density and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radial and tangential stresses .",
    "the metric functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to the energy - momentum tensor via the einstein equations that can be written in the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the misner - sharp mass of the system ( representing the amount of matter enclosed in the comoving shell labeled by @xmath1 at the time @xmath2 ) and for convenience we have defined the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 as , @xmath18 the collapse scenario is obtained by requiring @xmath19 and the central ` shell - focusing ' singularity is achieved for @xmath20 , where the density and spacetime curvatures blow up .",
    "divergence of @xmath8 is obtained also whenever @xmath21 , thus indicating the presence of a ` shell - crossing ' singularity .",
    "such singularities are generally believed to be gravitationally weak and do not correspond to divergence of curvature scalars , therefore indicating that they are removable by a suitable change of coordinates @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for this reason in the forthcoming discussion we will be concerned only with the shell - focusing singularity thus assuming @xmath22 .    since there is a scale invariance degree of freedom we can choose the initial time in such a way so that @xmath23 .",
    "therefore we can introduce the scaling function @xmath24 defined by , @xmath25 with @xmath26 , so that the collapse will be described by @xmath27 and the singularity will be reached at @xmath28 . we see that this is a better definition for the singularity since at @xmath29 the energy density does not diverge anywhere on the spacelike surfaces , including at the center @xmath30 .",
    "this is seen immediately from the regular behaviour of the mass function near the center that imposes that @xmath15 must go like @xmath31 close to @xmath30 ( as it will be shown later ) .",
    "such a regularity was not clear from equation , especially along the central curve @xmath30 , where we have @xmath20 , without the introduction of @xmath32 . in this manner the divergence of @xmath8 is only reached at the singularity .",
    "we note that @xmath32 acts like a label for successive events near the singularity since it is monotonically decreasing in @xmath2 and therefore can be used as a ` time ' coordinate in the place of @xmath2 itself near the singularity .",
    "we shall consider the misner - sharp mass to be in general a function of the comoving radius @xmath1 and the comoving time @xmath2 , expressed via the ` temporal ' label @xmath32 as @xmath33 near the center of the cloud this is just equivalent to a rewriting @xmath34 .",
    "it can be shown that vanishing of the pressure gradients near the center of the cloud imply that the radial and tangential stresses must assume the same value in the limit of approach to the center @xcite .",
    "this requirement comes from the fact that the metric functions should be at least @xmath35 at the center of the cloud and is a consequence of the fact that the einstein equation for a general fluid contains a term in @xmath36 that therefore must vanish at @xmath30 . since we are interested in the final stages of collapse of the core of a star it is therefore straightforward to take that the cloud behaves like a perfect fluid in proximity of @xmath30 .",
    "we shall then take , @xmath37    in such a case , we are then left with five equations in the six unknowns @xmath8 , @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath32 .",
    "the system becomes closed once an equation of state for the fluid matter is defined or assumed , but in general it is possible to study physically valid dynamics ( namely those satisfying regularity and energy conditions ) without assuming a priori an equation of state .",
    "in fact it is reasonable to suppose that any equation of state that holds at the departure from equilibrium , when the gravitational collapse commences , will not continue to hold in the extreme regimes achieved when approaching the singularity . in this case , we are then left with the freedom to choose one of the functions .",
    "if we take @xmath15 as the free function then from einstein equations and , @xmath38 and @xmath8 will follow immediately and they can be evaluated explicitly once we know @xmath32 and its derivatives .",
    "further , from the requirement for perfect fluid collapse we can write equation as @xmath39 equation can be integrated once we define a suitable function @xmath40 from @xmath41 then we get , @xmath42 where the integration function @xmath43 can be interpreted in analogy with the dust models and is seen to be related to the velocity of the infalling matter shells .",
    "finally , from equation we can write the equation of motion for @xmath13 in the form of an effective potential as @xmath44 this allows us to study the dynamics of the collapsing system in analogy of the usual phase - space tools of the classical mechanics type models .",
    "equation can be expressed in terms of the scaling factor @xmath32 as , @xmath45 where the minus sign has been considered in order to study the collapse .",
    "we see that in order to have a solution we must have @xmath46 , we can call this a ` reality condition ' that is necessary for the collapse dynamics to occur .",
    "solving the equation solves the set of einstein equations .",
    "einstein equations provide the relations between the spacetime geometry and the matter distribution within it , however , they do not give any statement about the type of matter that is responsible for the geometry . on a physical ground , not every type of matter distribution",
    "is allowed , and therefore some restrictions on the possible matter models must be made based on considerations of physical reasonableness .",
    "this usually comes in the form of energy conditions ensuring the positivity of mass - energy density .",
    "further , regularity conditions must be imposed in order for the matter fields to be well - behaved at the initial epoch from which the collapse evolves and at the center of the cloud .",
    "firstly , the finiteness of the energy density at all times anteceding the singularity and regularity of the misner - sharp mass in @xmath30 imply that in general we must have , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a regular function going to a finite value @xmath49 in the limit of approach to the center .",
    "if @xmath15 does not go as @xmath31 or higher power in the limit of approach to the center @xmath30 , we immediately see from the einstein equation for @xmath8 that there would be a singularity at the center at the initial epoch , which is not allowed by the regularity conditions as we are interested in collapse from regular initial configurations .",
    "also , requiring that the energy density has no cusps at the center is reflected in the condition , @xmath50    as seen before , the behaviour of the pressure gradients near @xmath30 suggests that the tangential and radial pressures become equal in limit of approach to the center , thus justifying our assumption of a perfect fluid type of matter .",
    "further since the gradient of the pressures must vanish at @xmath30 , we see that @xmath51 near @xmath30 which for the metric function @xmath11 implies that near the center , @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 can be absorbed in a redefinition of the time coordinate @xmath2 . from the above , via equation we can write @xmath54    from the analogy with the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models we can evaluate the regularity requirements for the velocity profile @xmath43 . since near the center @xmath55 can be written as , @xmath56 we now see how to interpret the free function @xmath43 in relation with the known ltb dust models .",
    "in fact the cases with @xmath57 constant are equivalent to the bound ( @xmath58 ) , unbound ( @xmath59 ) and marginally bound ( @xmath60 ) ltb collapse models . also , the condition that there be no shell - crossing singularities may imply some further restrictions on @xmath55 .",
    "as is known , matter models describing physically realistic sources must be constrained by some energy conditions .",
    "the weak energy condition in our case implies @xmath61 the first one is achieved whenever @xmath62 .",
    "in fact from equation we see that positivity of @xmath8 is compatible with positivity of @xmath63 only if @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we must have @xmath64 that close to the center will be satisfied whenever @xmath65 . now from @xmath66 we can rewrite @xmath8 as @xmath67 from which we see that the second weak energy condition is satisfied whenever @xmath68 finally the choice of a mass profile satisfying the above equation allows us to rewrite the condition as @xmath69 which is obviously satisfied if the pressure is positive ( since it implies @xmath70 ) but can be satisfied also by some choice of negative pressure profiles .",
    "the dynamical evolution of collapse is entirely determined once the initial data set is given @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifying the initial conditions consists in prescribing the values of the three metric functions and of the density and pressure profiles as functions of @xmath1 on the initial time surface given by @xmath71 .",
    "this reduces to defining the following functions : @xmath72 at the initial time the choice of the scale function @xmath32 is such that @xmath73 , furthermore , from @xmath74 we get @xmath75 .",
    "since the initial data must obey einstein equations it follows that not all of the initial value functions can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "in fact the choice of the mass profile together with einstein equations is enough to specify the four remaining functions . from equations and , writing @xmath76",
    "we get @xmath77 while from equation we get , @xmath78 from equation we can write , @xmath79 with @xmath80 related to @xmath81 by @xmath82 in turn , @xmath83 can be related to the function @xmath84 , defined by equation , at the initial time via equation , @xmath85 finally , the initial condition for @xmath12 can be related to the initial value of the function @xmath86 from equation and equation , @xmath87    since we are studying the final stages of collapse and the formation of black holes and naked singularities , we must require the initial configuration to be not trapped",
    ". this will allow for the formation of trapped surfaces during collapse and therefore we must require @xmath88 from which we see how the choice of the initial matter configuration @xmath81 is related to the initial boundary of the collapsing cloud . some restrictions on the choices of the radial boundary must be made in order not to have trapped surfaces at the initial time .",
    "this condition is reflected on the initial configuration for @xmath17 and @xmath16 since @xmath89 and this condition also gives some constraints on the initial velocity .",
    "in fact to avoid trapped surfaces at the initial time the velocity of the infalling shells must satisfy @xmath90 we see that the initial velocity of the cloud must always be positive and that the case of equilibrium configuration where @xmath91 can be taken only in the limit .",
    "the consideration of a perfect fluid matter model implies that the misner - sharp mass is in general not conserved during collapse .",
    "therefore the matching with an exterior spherically symmetric solution leads to consider the generalized vaidya spacetime .",
    "it can be proven that matching to a generalized vaidya exterior is always possible when the collapsing cloud is taken to have compact support within the boundary taken at @xmath92 , and the pressure of the matter is assumed to vanish at the boundary @xcite-@xcite .",
    "matching conditions imply continuity of the metric and its first derivatives across the boundary surface .",
    "such a matching is in principle always possible but it should be noted that matching conditions together with regularity and energy conditions , might impose some further restrictions on the allowed initial configurations .    in the following we are interested in the local visibility of the central singularity occurring at the end of the collapse . therefore we will restrict our attention to a neighborhood of the central line @xmath30 . in this case",
    "it is easy to see that there always exist a neighborhood for which no shell crossing singularities occur .",
    "this is seen by the fact that @xmath93 and therefore , since @xmath94 and shell crossing singularities are defined by @xmath21 , we can always fulfill @xmath95 in the vicinity of the center . furthermore ,",
    "as it was mentioned before , matter behaves like a perfect fluid close to the center .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that regularity of the metric functions at the initial time requires that @xmath96 does not blow up at the regular center .",
    "this in turn implies that from equation we must have @xmath97 , and the condition holds for any time @xmath2 before the singularity .",
    "we study now the possible outcomes of collapse evolution .",
    "it is known that in general the final fate of the complete collapse of the matter cloud will be either a black hole or a naked singularity , depending on the choice of the initial data and the dynamical evolutions as allowed by the einstein equations .    in order to analyze the final outcome of collapse",
    "we shall perform a change of coordinates from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , thus considering @xmath100 . as mentioned earlier",
    "this is always possible near the center of the cloud due to the monotonic behaviour of @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the derivative of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath1 in the @xmath98 coordinates shall be considered as a function of the new coordinates , @xmath101 .",
    "we see that regularity at the center of the cloud implies @xmath102 as @xmath103 .",
    "we can then consider the metric function @xmath104 which is given by equation , which now becomes , @xmath105 where now @xmath106 and @xmath107 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 in the @xmath99 coordinates .",
    "this implies , @xmath108 for the sake of clarity , we may assume here that near the center the mass function @xmath109 can be written as a series as , @xmath110    as a regularity condition , we take @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the function @xmath84 can then be written as an expansion and it takes the form , @xmath113 with the first terms @xmath114 given by @xmath115 if we restrict our analysis to constant @xmath32 surfaces then in equation we can put @xmath116 and its derivatives to be zero .",
    "on the other hand if we approach the singularity along a generic curve we can not neglect the terms in @xmath116 .",
    "the equation of motion takes the form @xmath117 which can be inverted to give the function @xmath118 that represents the time at which the comoving shell labeled @xmath1 reaches the event @xmath32 , @xmath119 then the time at which the shell labeled by @xmath1 becomes singular can be written as a singularity curve as @xmath120 regularity ensures that , in general , @xmath118 is at least @xmath35 near the singularity and therefore can be expanded as , @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    of course",
    "the situations with discontinuities can be analyzed as well with minor technical modifications to the above formalism . in our case , assuming that @xmath118 can be expanded implies that the first two terms in the expansion of @xmath40 must vanish . as seen before vanishing of first term is consistent with the regularity condition for @xmath11 that follows from the pressure gradients at the center , while vanishing of second term implies that @xmath125 must be a constant , which gives , in accordance with the requirement that the energy density has no cusps at the center , that @xmath111 .",
    "the singularity curve then takes the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the time at which the central shell becomes singular .    by a simple calculation , retaining for the sake of completeness all the terms in the expansions of @xmath48 and expanding @xmath11 as @xmath128",
    ", we obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130dv \\ ; , \\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath131 .",
    "the apparent horizon is the boundary of trapped surfaces which in general is given by , @xmath132 in the case of spherical collapse the above equation reduces to @xmath133 , which together with equation gives , @xmath134 this describes a curve @xmath135 given by @xmath136 inversely , the apparent horizon curve can be expressed as the curve @xmath137 which gives the time at which the shell labeled by @xmath1 becomes trapped .    in the dust case",
    ", the condition @xmath138 implies that approaching the singularity the radius of the apparent horizon must shrink to zero thus leaving @xmath139 as the only point of the singularity curve that can in principle be visible to far away observers . on the other hand , in the perfect fluid case we note that models where the mass profile has different dependence on @xmath32 will lead to totally different structures for the apparent horizon and the trapped region .",
    "indeed in full generality there can be cases where non - central singularities become visible .",
    "this is possible in the case in which @xmath109 goes to zero as @xmath32 goes to zero , leaving @xmath140 bounded ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "presently , we are interested in the case where only the central singularity would be visible . in order to understand what are the features relevant towards determining the visibility of the singularity to external observers we can evaluate the time curve of the apparent horizon in such cases as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the singularity time curve , whose initial point is @xmath143 . near @xmath30 , equation can be written in the form , @xmath144 from which we see how the presence of pressures affects the time of the formation of the apparent horizon .",
    "in fact , all the initial configurations that cause @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 in case that @xmath145 vanishes ) to be positive will cause the apparent horizon curve to be increasing , and trapped surfaces to form at a later stage than the singularity , thus leaving the possibility that null geodesics escape from the central singularity . by studying the equation for outgoing radial null geodesics it is possible to determine that whenever the apparent horizon is increasing in time at the singularity there will be families of outgoing future directed null geodesics that reach outside observers from the central singularity , at least locally .",
    "it can be shown that positivity of the first non - null coefficient @xmath147 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the visibility of the central singularity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the scenario of collapse of a cloud composed of perfect fluid offers some more intriguing possibilities .",
    "in fact we can see from equation that whenever the mass function @xmath15 goes to zero as collapse evolves it is possible to delay the formation of trapped surfaces in such a way that a portion of the singularity curve @xmath142 becomes timelike .",
    "this in turn leads to the possibility that non - central shells are visible when they become singular @xcite , thus introducing a new scenario that is not possible for dust collapse .",
    "it is easy to verify that in order for the mass function to be radiated away during the evolution the pressure of the fluid must be negative at some point before the formation of the singularity . despite this seemingly artificial feature",
    "negative pressures are worth investigating as they could point to a breakdown of classical gravity and could describe the occurrence of quantum effects close to the formation of the singularity @xcite .",
    "we will now use the general formalism developed above to study how the outcomes of gravitational collapse , either in terms of a black hole or naked singularity , are altered once an arbitrarily small pressure perturbation in the initial data set is introduced .    the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) model ( @xcite-@xcite ) for inhomogeneous dust and homogeneous perfect fluid is reviewed describing necessary conditions for the ltb collapse scenario .",
    "then certain perfect fluid models are given , using the treatment above , by making specific choices for the free function so that it reduces to the ltb case for some values of the parameters .",
    "we show how the choice of these parameters or introduction of small pressure perturbations is enough to change the final outcome of collapse of the inhomogeneous dust .    from equations we see that if we account for regularity and physically valid density and pressure profiles ( typically including only quadratic terms in @xmath1 ) we have @xmath148",
    ". then the final outcome of collapse will be decided by @xmath146 as written in equation .",
    "we see immediately that once the matter model is fixed globally , thus specifying @xmath48 , the sign of @xmath146 depends continuously on the values at the initial time taken by the parameters @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( with @xmath152 ) . by continuity",
    "then we can say that , away from the critical surface for which @xmath153 , if a certain initial configuration leads to a black hole ( thus having @xmath154 ) , then changing slightly the values of the initial parameters @xmath48 , @xmath155 , @xmath84 will not change the final outcome .",
    "the same result holds for naked singularities and leads us to conclude that every initial data set for which @xmath156 will have a small neighborhood leading to the same outcome @xcite .",
    "the same , however , can not be said for the surface separating these two possible outcomes of collapse , where @xmath153 . in this case",
    "it is the sign of the next non - vanishing @xmath157 that determines the final outcome and it is easy to see that the introduction of a small pressure such that @xmath158 becomes non - zero for some @xmath159 can change the final fate from black hole to naked singularity and viceversa .",
    "consider the scenario where the coefficients @xmath157 vanish for every @xmath160 .",
    "this critical surface represents the case of simultaneous collapse , or when @xmath161 , where a black hole forms at the end of collapse and it includes ( though it is not uniquely restricted to ) the oppenheimer - snyder - datt homogeneous dust collapse model .",
    "while this is the case for homogeneous dust , it is also easy to show that for inhomogeneous dust and for perfect fluid collapse also there are initial configurations that lead to simultaneous collapse , once inhomogeneities , velocity profile , and pressure are chosen suitably .",
    "in fact if we consider collapse of general type i matter fields , we can always suitably tune the parameters in order to have simultaneous collapse and therefore a black hole final outcome .",
    "nevertheless , in all these cases , the introduction of a small pressure can drastically change the final outcome by making some @xmath157 turn positive .",
    "of course in full generality there will also be regions in which the ` reality condition ' is not satisfied and therefore no final outcome is possible .",
    "but if we restrict our attention to a close neighborhood of the center we will always have a complete collapse of the inner shells thus leading to a black hole or a naked singularity .    in this sense",
    "we can consider a small perturbation of any type i fluid collapse .",
    "we see that the initial data not lying on the critical surface will not change the outcome of collapse once a small perturbation in @xmath48 or @xmath38 or @xmath55 is introduced . on the other hand ,",
    "those initial data sets that belong to the critical surface might indeed change outcome entirely as a result of the introduction of a small inhomogeneity , or a small pressure or small velocity .",
    "we shall now consider below some collapse models that can be obtained from the above formalism , and analyze these under the introduction of small pressure perturbations .",
    "the simplest model that can be studied for small pressure perturbations is the well - known lemaitre - tolman - bondi spacetime , where the matter form is dust with pressures assumed to be vanishing .",
    "it is interesting to know how the collapse outcome would change when small pressure perturbations are introduced in the cloud , which is a more realistic scenario compared to pressureless dust .",
    "the spacetime metric in this case takes the form , @xmath162 and it can be obtained from the above formalism not only if we impose the matter to be dust but also once we require homogeneity of the pressures ( namely imposing @xmath163 ) .",
    "in fact , if we take @xmath164 or @xmath165 , from einstein equations , together with the regularity condition for @xmath11 and @xmath43 we obtain @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath168 where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath2 only in the case of homogeneous pressure , and it is a function of @xmath1 only in the case of dust . in the case where @xmath169 is a constant we retrieve the oppenheimer - snyder - datt homogeneous dust model that , as it is known , develops a black hole at the end of collapse .",
    "the inhomogeneous dust model is obtained by requiring @xmath138 . in this case from equation follows @xmath165 and in general @xmath32 can be a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( requiring @xmath170 is a necessary and sufficient condition to obtain the osd case ) . the final outcome of collapse is fully determined once the mass profile and the velocity profile are assigned ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .     and @xmath171 . in this case @xmath148 and @xmath146 determines the final outcome of collapse depending on the values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "there are initial data sets that have a whole neighborhood leading to the same outcome in terms of either a black hole or naked singularity .",
    "the osd case lies on the critical surface separating the two outcomes which is defined by @xmath172 for all @xmath160 . ]    for example , in the marginally bound case ( namely @xmath60 ) the singularity curve for inhomogeneous dust becomes @xmath173 and the apparent horizon curve is given by @xmath174 and in general collapse may lead to black hole or naked singularity depending on the behaviour of the mass profile @xmath175 . by writing @xmath175 near @xmath30 as a series",
    "@xmath176 we see that the lowest order non - vanishing @xmath81 ( with @xmath177 ) governs the final outcome of collapse . as expected in this case , we have @xmath178    in the perfect fluid ltb model ( corresponding to the frw cosmological models in case of expansion ) we have that requiring @xmath170 is a sufficient condition for having homogeneous collapse .",
    "in fact the following two statement can be easily proved :    1 .",
    "@xmath179 2 .",
    "@xmath180    the overall behaviour of the collapsing cloud is determined by the three functions @xmath181 , @xmath24 and @xmath182 ( which , as we have seen , are not independent from one another ) and the special cases of oppenheimer - snyder - datt metric and lemaitre - tolman - bondi perfect fluid metric can be summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath183      we consider now an example based on the above framework by introducing a small pressure perturbation to the inhomogeneous dust model described in the previous section .",
    "we consider in general @xmath184 and the mass function is chosen of the form @xmath185 where @xmath49 is a constant and the pressure perturbation is taken to be small in the sense that @xmath186 at all times ( in this way , as collapse progresses and the density diverges the model remains close to the ltb collapse as the pressure is always smaller than the density ) .",
    "we immediately see that setting @xmath187 reduces the model to that of inhomogeneous dust ( and @xmath188 further gives the osd homogeneous dust ) .",
    "we note that in this case no non - central singularities are visible since @xmath48 does not vanish at @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , just like in the dust case , only the central singularity at @xmath30 might eventually be visible .    in this case",
    "we can integrate equation explicitly to obtain @xmath189 where @xmath190 now is the value taken by @xmath149 at the initial time when @xmath191 .",
    "therefore we can take the mass function in such a way that it corresponds to the ltb inhomogeneous dust at initial time with the pressure perturbation being triggered only at a later stage .",
    "we can therefore take , @xmath192 and the initial condition @xmath193 implies that @xmath194 ( remember that @xmath195 $ ] ) . by taking all the higher order terms to be vanishing we easily see that @xmath196 for @xmath197 and @xmath198 near @xmath30 .    in this case",
    "the pressure and the energy density near @xmath30 become @xmath199 we therefore have two simple possibilities for the choice of the free function @xmath200 which determines @xmath48 :    1 .",
    "@xmath201 which implies @xmath202 and positive pressure .",
    "@xmath203 which implies @xmath204 and negative pressure .    from the above ,",
    "further assuming @xmath60 for simplicity in accordance with marginally bound ltb models , it follows immediately that @xmath205 and @xmath206 where we defined the function @xmath207 we see that @xmath146 is divided into two integrals . if we assume that the pressure perturbation is small ( thus considering @xmath49 to be big ) then the second integral can in principle be neglected .",
    "in fact for a suitable choice of @xmath49 it is not difficult to prove that the function at the denominator will be positive and monotonically increasing , and therefore it would not affect the sign of the integral , while the second integral will be small enough as compared to the first one .",
    "positivity of @xmath146 will then be decided by the sign of @xmath208 .    , @xmath60 and @xmath209 .",
    "on the left the pressure is taken to be @xmath210 and it reduces to zero for @xmath211 .",
    "on the right the pressure perturbation is given by @xmath212 .",
    "the introduction of the pressure can uncover an otherwise clothed singularity depending on the values of @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath190 .",
    "different choices of @xmath48 with @xmath215 will have a similar qualitative behaviour . ]    , @xmath60 and @xmath209 . on the left",

    "this is certainly the case whenever @xmath217 for any @xmath32 .",
    "therefore if we define @xmath218\\}$ ] all the values of @xmath219 will lead to a naked singularity . on the other hand , values of @xmath220\\}$ ]",
    "will lead to the formation of a black hole . for @xmath221 $ ]",
    "the explicit form of @xmath222 is what determines the sign of @xmath146 .",
    "it can be proven that we can have models in which positive values of @xmath190 lead to the formation of a naked singularity whereas the inhomogeneous dust case led to a black hole .",
    "we now analyze another case where the pressure perturbation introduced does not depend explicitly on @xmath32 .",
    "a similar situation was investigated by one of us earlier in @xcite .",
    "here we consider a pressure perturbation of ltb models of the form @xmath224 .",
    "if we impose @xmath225 in the equation , we can then solve for @xmath48 and explicitly evaluate @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain in that case , @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 come from integration . here",
    "the case where @xmath229 reduces the system to dust . in this sense , if we keep @xmath230 we will consider this model to be a small perturbation of ltb in a similar way as was discussed in the previous example . then the radial derivatives of @xmath231 will correspond to the inhomogeneities in the ltb models while the pressure , or the function @xmath214 , can be taken to be either positive or negative ( with positive pressure corresponding to an increasing mass function @xmath48 and negative pressure corresponding to a decreasing mass function ) .    in order to work on a specific model for the sake of clarity , we assume that @xmath214 and @xmath231 can be expanded near the center as , @xmath232 then the pressure and density become @xmath233 imposing regularity requires that @xmath234 , which implies @xmath235 . at the center of the cloud",
    "the pressure and density become @xmath236 and @xmath237 , and the energy conditions impose that @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "then from equation we can integrate explicitly to obtain , @xmath240 where we have defined @xmath241 then we get , @xmath242    from the above expressions , we can easily obtain now @xmath145 and @xmath146 . for simplicity",
    "we consider here the case where @xmath243 .",
    "then @xmath148 and we get , @xmath244 }      { \\left(y_0v^3+z_0+\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{y_2}{z_0}v(1-v^3)\\right ) ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\right]\\sqrt{v}dv\\ ] ] we see from here that the sign of @xmath146 is explicitly determined by the inhomogeneities ( @xmath245 ) and the pressure gradient ( @xmath246 ) ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "once again taking @xmath247 and @xmath248 reduces the system to the osd collapse scenario and we see that the introduction of the slightest pressure can change drastically the outcome of collapse . on the other hand , taking only @xmath247 ( with @xmath249 ) we retrieve the ltb model and once again to change the final outcome of collapse we must choose @xmath246 suitably to balance the contribution to @xmath146 given by the inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore we see again that also within this perturbation model any collapse with initial data taken in a neighborhood of a model leading to a certain outcome and not lying on the critical surface will result in the same endstate .",
    "the equation for the apparent horizon curve can be easily written in this case and becomes @xmath250 which is a cubic equation in @xmath251 that admits in general three solutions in the case where @xmath252 .",
    "obviously this condition is satisfied near @xmath30 for positive pressures ( that correspond to negative @xmath214 ) and this indicates , as already stated , that the mass function is not vanishing at any time and therefore the central shell becomes trapped at the time of formation of the singularity . on the other hand , for negative pressures the central shell is not trapped and the formation of the apparent horizon can be shifted to some outer shells or removed altogether .     as a function of @xmath246 and @xmath245 provides the phase space of initial data for the perfect fluid model with @xmath224 .",
    "here we have taken @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "again , there are initial data sets that have a whole neighborhood leading to the same outcome which is either a black hole or naked singularity .",
    "the osd case lies on the critical surface separating the black holes from naked singularities . ]      as we mentioned , the case of simultaneous collapse , which means that the final state of collapse is necessarily a black hole , need not be restricted to the oppenheimer - snyder - datt model only .",
    "in fact for different kinds of general type i matter fields there might be suitable choices of the parameters that lead the final state of collapse to be simultaneous .",
    "this is of course the case when the pressures are homogeneous , that is represented by the time reversal of the friedman - robertson - walker model , but more general matter models might also lead to the same behaviour .",
    "simultaneous collapse means that all matter shells terminate into the singularity at the same time .",
    "then we see from equation , which describes the singularity curve , that all coefficients @xmath147 must vanish , or equivalently that @xmath255 . from equation we can see that a sufficient condition for simultaneous collapse is @xmath256 this condition , for any given choice of the matter model , leads to a choice of the free function @xmath43 as @xmath257 it is easy to check that in the case of dust this reduces to @xmath258 and since the mass profile in this case is a function of @xmath1",
    "only , we conclude that equation is satisfied for dust only by the case of homogeneous dust collapse ( where @xmath259 and @xmath260 ) . nevertheless , as we have said , this need not be the only case when the collapse is simultaneous . for example it s straightforward to see that when pressures are considered , the same condition as above holds for collapse of an homogeneous perfect fluid , where , in this case , @xmath261 .",
    "furthermore it is possible that the condition can be satisfied by some suitable function @xmath43 also for more general pressure profiles , since in general the mass function depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or for some other suitable choice of the velocity profile .    in order to better understand the conditions under which we can have simultaneous collapse in full generality ,",
    "let us now consider a general perfect fluid matter model given by a choice of @xmath109 ( which implies @xmath84 from equation ) , thus specifying all coefficients @xmath262 .",
    "firstly , we notice from equation that a suitable choice of @xmath263 is necessary in order for the reality condition to be fulfilled near the center . therefore , once we made this choice and carried out the integration for equation we see that @xmath264 depends linearly on @xmath265 only",
    ". in fact we can write @xmath266 from which we see that it will always be possible to choose @xmath265 suitably such that @xmath205 .",
    "the same reasoning can then be applied for all other coefficients @xmath147 that will depend linearly on @xmath267 as , @xmath268 and therefore for a given mass profile @xmath109 we can have simultaneous collapse if a suitable velocity profile @xmath43 given by @xmath269 exists .",
    "this means that the power series @xmath270 should converge to some function @xmath182 with a radius of convergence greater than the boundary of the cloud .",
    "this is certainly possible in the case of homogeneous pressures , where the condition that all @xmath147 vanish imposes that @xmath271 , and therefore @xmath272 .",
    "also , as we have seen in the examples above , this might be possible for other matter profiles as well . given any such model leading to simultaneous collapse ( and thus to the formation of a black hole ) , we have shown that the introduction of the slightest pressure perturbation in the initial data can turn the final outcome into a naked singularity .",
    "overall we have seen that the sign of @xmath146 and therefore the final outcome of collapse shares similar qualitative behaviour in different perfect fluid models as it is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     and with @xmath60 .",
    "the introduction of pressures @xmath38 and inhomogeneities @xmath190 can uncover an otherwise clothed singularity . also",

    "the same holds for the initial data set @xmath274 leading to black hole . the ltb model ( obtained for @xmath165 and )",

    "can lead to either of the outcomes and the osd scenario ( obtained when there are no inhomogeneities ) always lies on the critical surface separating the two outcomes and is therefore ` unstable ' . ]",
    "as we have seen , the final outcome of collapse depends upon the evolution of the pressure , the density and the velocity profiles .",
    "if the system is closed , as it is in the case where an equation of state describing the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath8 is given , then specifying the values of the above quantities at the initial time uniquely determines the final outcome of collapse .",
    "if the system is not closed , then we must further specify the behaviour of the free functions . once again for every possible choice of the free function(s ) the final outcome of collapse is decided by the initial values of @xmath38 , @xmath8 and @xmath55 .",
    "the genericity is defined here as every point in the initial data set leading to a naked singularity ( or a black hole ) has a neighborhood in the space of initial data for collapse whose points all lead to the same outcome .",
    "we show that the initial data set leading the collapse to a naked singularity forms an open subset of a suitable function space comprising of the initial data , with respect to an appropriate norm which makes the function space an infinite dimensional banach space .",
    "the measure theoretic aspects of this open set are considered and we argue that a suitable well - defined measure of this set must be strictly positive .",
    "this ensures genericity of initial data in a well - defined manner .    at this point ,",
    "the question of whether the given outcome is ` generic ' or not in a certain suitable sense yet to be defined , with respect to the allowed initial data sets , arises naturally .",
    "we shall therefore analyze the expression for the genericity of initial data leading the collapse to a naked singularity .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the case where @xmath145 vanishes and we must analyze equation and they can be used to investigate the genericity of the black hole formation scenario just as well .    as is known the concept of ` genericity ' is not well - defined in general relativity . normally , by the word ` generic ' , one means ` in abundance ' or ` substantially big ' .",
    "this terminology has been used by many researcher working in relativity , and in gravitational collapse in particular ( see for example , @xcite-@xcite ) . in the theory of dynamical systems , however , the definition of ` genericity ' is given more tightly .",
    "there , one considers the class @xmath275 of all @xmath276 vector fields ( dynamical systems ) defined on a given manifold . a property @xmath277 satisfied by a vector field @xmath278 in @xmath275",
    "is called generic if the set of all vector fields satisfying this property contains an open and dense subset of @xmath275 .",
    "this was the definition used by one of us in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , such a definition would render both black holes and naked singularities to be ` non - generic ' , as we remarked earlier .",
    "therefore in the present paper we have opted for a less stringent but physically more meaningful definition of genericity by requiring that the subset is open , and that it has a non - zero measure .",
    "the main reason for this comes from the fact that the ` denseness ' property depends on the topology used and the parent space used , and there are no unique and unambiguous definitions available in this regard as discussed earlier .",
    "hence the nomenclature of ` generic ' in the present paper is used in the sense in which most of the relativists use it , _",
    "i.e. _ in the sense of abundance .",
    "this looks physically more satisfactory definition , allowing both black holes and naked singularities to be generic . in any case",
    ", the key point is that regardless of the definition used , both the collapse outcomes do share the same ` genericity ' properties , which is what our work here shows .",
    "first of all we note that the functions must satisfy the ` reality condition ' for the gravitational collapse to take place , namely @xmath279 where we have defined @xmath280 .",
    "we shall now prove that , given a mass function @xmath109 , and the function @xmath281 on the initial surface , there exists a large class of velocity distribution functions @xmath182 such that the final outcome is a naked singularity .",

    "@xmath296 is also a @xmath294-function in @xmath297 which means @xmath296 is lipschitz continuous in @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , the differential equation has a unique solution satisfying the initial condition , provided @xmath296 satisfies a certain condition given below .",
    "further , we can ensure that the solution will be defined over the entire cloud , _",

    "the collapsing cloud may start with @xmath308 small enough so that the expression @xmath309 which is always positive , satisfies the condition with @xmath297 restricted to a bounded domain .",
    "we then have infinitely many choices for the function @xmath299 , which is continuous and satisfies conditions and for each choice of @xmath32 . for each such @xmath299",

    "hence , for all these configurations the central singularity developed in the collapse is a naked singularity .",
    "the above analysis shows that the initial data satisfying conditions , and lead the collapse to a naked singularity .",
    "if we change the sign in condition , call it condition @xmath314 , then above analysis apply and the initial data satisfying conditions , @xmath314 and lead the collapse to a black hole . in the cases discussed above , in addition to above conditions , energy conditions are also to be satisfied , and we have shown above that this is always possible for matter models leading to both possible outcomes .",
    "thus , from the above analysis , we get the following conditions which should be satisfied by the initial data in order that the end state of collapse is a naked singularity :    1 .",
    "energy conditions : @xmath315 , and @xmath316 .",
    "2 .   reality condition given by equation above .",

    "we denote the function @xmath321 then the reality condition ( 2 ) becomes @xmath322 . assuming this condition , condition ( 3 )",
    "will be satisfied if and only if @xmath323 for naked singularity , and @xmath324 0 for a black hole .",
    "whenever @xmath325 is an increasing function of @xmath1 in the neighborhood of @xmath326 , we get its derivative positive , and so @xmath318 , and end state will be a black hole . on the other hand , if @xmath325 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 in the neighborhood of @xmath326 , we get its derivative negative , and so @xmath327 , and the endstate will be a naked singularity .",
    "regarding condition ( 4 ) , using the expression @xmath328 , it becomes @xmath329 which will be satisfied if @xmath32 and @xmath330 are sufficiently small .",
    "thus validity of all these conditions does not put any stringent restrictions on the initial data .",
    "the conclusion then is the following : if the initial data consisting of the mass function @xmath109 and function @xmath281 satisfies the above conditions , then there is a large class of velocity functions @xmath182 such that end state of collapse is either a black hole or a naked singularity , depending on the nature of function @xmath325 as explained above .",
    "we now show that the set of initial data @xmath331 satisfying the above conditions which lead the collapse to a naked singularity , is an open subset of @xmath332 , where @xmath278 is an infinite dimensional banach space of all @xmath333 or @xmath334 real - valued functions defined on @xmath335 \\times   [ 0 ,   d ] $ ] , endowed with the norms latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    \\parallel \\textit{m}(r , v ) \\parallel_{1 } & = & \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } } |\\textit{m }   |    + \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } } |\\textit{m}_{,r}| + \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } } |\\textit{m}_{,v}| \\ ; ,     \\\\    \\parallel \\textit{m}(r , v ) \\parallel_{2 } & = & \\parallel \\textit{m}(r , v ) \\parallel_{1 }    + \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } } |\\textit{m}_{,rr }   | + \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } } |\\textit{m}_{,rv}|   + \\sup_{{\\mathcal{d } } }     these norms are equivalent to the standard @xmath333 and @xmath334 norms , @xmath337    let @xmath338 be a subset of @xmath278 , where @xmath339 and @xmath340",
    ". thus @xmath341 and @xmath342 are equivalent to energy conditions .",
    "we first show that @xmath343 is an open subset of @xmath278 . for simplicity ,",
    "we use the @xmath333 norm , but a similar proof holds for the @xmath334 norm also . for @xmath344 , let us put @xmath345 , @xmath346 , @xmath347 , @xmath348 , @xmath349 and for @xmath1 varying in @xmath350 $ ] and @xmath351 $ ] , the functions involved herein are all continuous functions defined on a compact domain @xmath352 and hence , their maxima and minima exist .",
    "we define a positive real number @xmath353    let @xmath354 be @xmath333 in @xmath352 with @xmath355 . using above definition we get @xmath356 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 over @xmath352 . therefore , for choice of @xmath359 , the respective inequalities are @xmath360 that are satisfied on @xmath361 .",
    "the @xmath362 , @xmath363 and @xmath364 inequalities from above yield @xmath365 further , we can write @xmath366 - e_{1}| < e_{1 } $ ] where @xmath367 on @xmath352 .    hence , @xmath368 on @xmath352 .",
    "using similar analysis for last four inequalities of equation , we obtain @xmath369 on @xmath352 .    thus , @xmath370 , @xmath371 is @xmath333 , @xmath372 > 0 $ ] and @xmath373 > 0 $ ] on @xmath374  provided @xmath375 throughout @xmath361 .",
    "therefore , @xmath354 also lies in @xmath376 and hence ,  @xmath376 is an open subset of @xmath278 .    using the similar argument",
    "we can show that the set @xmath377 is also an open subset of @xmath278 .",
    "thus the set of @xmath109 satisfying above conditions forms an open subset of @xmath278 , since intersection of finite number of open sets is open .",
    "similar arguments show that the set of @xmath281 and @xmath43 satisfying these conditions form separately open subsets of @xmath278 . hence using definition of product topology",
    "we see that the set @xmath378 defined above is an open subset of @xmath379 .",
    "thus initial data leading the collapse to a naked singularity forms an open subset of the banach space of all possible initial data , and therefore it is generic .",
    "we now discuss measure theoretic properties of the open set @xmath378 consisting of the initial data leading the collapse to a naked singularity . by referring to the relevant literature about measures on infinite dimensional separable banach spaces",
    ", we argue that this @xmath378 has strictly positive measure in an appropriate sense . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a single space @xmath278 and its open subset @xmath378 .",
    "we ask the question : does there exist a measure on @xmath278 which takes positive value on @xmath378 ? to answer this question , we note that @xmath278 is an infinite dimensional separable banach space , and it is a consequence of riesz lemma in functional analysis that every open ball in @xmath278 contains an infinite disjoint sequence of smaller open balls .",
    "so , if we want a translation invariant measure on @xmath278 then its value will be same on each of these balls .",
    "thus , if we demand that the surrounding ball has finite measure , then each of these smaller balls will have measure zero",
    ". otherwise sum of their measures would be infinite by countable additivity .",
    "in other words , for separable banach spaces , every open set has either measure zero or infinite under a translation invariant measure .",
    "so , if we wish to have a non - trivial measure on @xmath278 , then we have to discard the property of translation invariance .",
    "in that case we must shift to gaussian measures or wiener measures . under these measures",
    ", we can conclude that an open subset of @xmath278 will have a positive measure .",
    "for example , it is proved in @xcite ( theorem 2 on page 159 ) , that gaussian measure of an open ball in a separable banach space is positive .",
    "we can also use wiener measure on @xmath380)$]to get the same result ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , for all practical purposes in physics and astrophysics , physical functions could be assumed to be taylor expandable . thus assuming that our initial data is regular and taylor expandable , and again working for simplicity with a single function space , instead of product space",
    ", we can formulate our problem of measure as follows : let @xmath381 denote the space of taylor expandable functions defined on an interval @xmath382 $ ] .",
    "we consider initial data consisting of functions with first finite number of terms , say @xmath0 terms , which lead the collapse to a naked singularity",
    ". these functions will belong to a finite dimensional space isomorphic to @xmath383 . working with supremum norm as above and arguing similarly",
    ", we can prove that the initial data set satisfying conditions ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) above is an open subset of @xmath383 .",
    "now , we have a standard result ( see for example @xcite , prop .",
    "4.3.4 , page 83 ) that a lebesgue measure of an open subset in @xmath383 is strictly positive . denoting this measure by @xmath384 and the open set by @xmath385 ,",
    "we get @xmath386 .",
    "if , further , @xmath385 is bounded , then @xmath387 will be finite .",
    "hence normalized lebesgue measure of an open subset , and in particular , of an open ball in @xmath383 is also strictly positive , and in fact bounded .",
    "we ask the question : assuming that @xmath388 , can we get a measure on @xmath381 such that measure of @xmath378 is positive ? this is answered affirmatively by maxwell - poincar theorem which is stated as follows ( see for example @xcite ) : + consider the sequence of the normalized lebesgue measures on the euclidean spheres @xmath389 of radius @xmath390 and the limit of spaces @xmath391 then the weak limit of these measures is the standard gaussian measure @xmath359 which is the infinite product of the identical gaussian measures on the line with zero mean and variance @xmath392 . thus the limit exists and is positive on an open subset @xmath378 .",
    "it is also possible to give other approaches which answers affirmatively the existence of such limits which are termed as infinite products or in general ` projective limits ' .",
    "we describe briefly one such approach as described by yamasaki @xcite ( for general concepts on measure theory , we refer to @xcite )",
    ". + let @xmath393 denote the infinite product of real lines .",
    "let @xmath394 be the subspace of @xmath395 given by @xmath396 : there exists @xmath397 with @xmath398 for @xmath399 .",
    "then @xmath395 is the algebraic dual of @xmath394 and @xmath400 is the weak borel field of @xmath395 .",
    "members of @xmath401 are called weak borel subsets of @xmath395",
    ". the space @xmath381 mentioned above can be seen isomorphic to a subspace of @xmath393 , and is isomorphic to @xmath394 if we consider a finite number of terms in the taylor expansion .",
    "let @xmath402 denote one dimensional lebesgue measure on @xmath403 .",
    "let @xmath404 be a sequence of borel sets of @xmath403 such that @xmath405 .",
    "we shall define two borel measures @xmath406 and @xmath407 by @xmath408 @xmath406 is @xmath409-finite , whereas @xmath407 is a probability measure on @xmath410 .    consider the product measure @xmath411 then @xmath412 is @xmath409-finite on @xmath395 .",
    "+ then we have the following theorem : for every weak borel set @xmath413 of @xmath395 , put @xmath414 this limit always exists and becomes a @xmath409-finite @xmath415-invariant measure on @xmath395 .",
    "then @xmath416 lies on @xmath417 where @xmath418 we note that the measure @xmath416 defined in this theorem is called the infinite dimensional lebesgue measure supported by @xmath419 .    for any open bounded subset @xmath413 of @xmath395",
    ", @xmath413 is a borel set and hence a weak borel set .",
    "moreover @xmath420 and both these factors are finite .",
    "thus the measure @xmath416 takes a non - zero value on an open bounded subset @xmath413 of @xmath395 .",
    "we can employ this measure instead of the gaussian measure mentioned in maxwell - poincar theorem to yield the desired result .",
    "in any case , use of probability measure is inevitable and we conclude that the space of initial data leading to a certain outcome ( be it black hole or naked singularity ) , within a specific collapse scenario has non zero measure with respect to the set of all possible initial data .",
    "as is known the presence of an equation of state introduces a differential relation for the previously considered free function that closes the system of einstein equations .",
    "examples of simple , astrophysically relevant , linear and polytropic equations of states are discussed below .    in the scenario described above ,",
    "the relation between the density and pressure could vary during collapse , as it is natural to assume in the case where we go from a nearly newtonian initial state to a final state where a very strong gravitational field is present .",
    "the equation relating @xmath38 to @xmath8 will therefore be represented by some function of @xmath1 and @xmath32 that is related to the choice of the free function @xmath48 .",
    "there are at present many indications that suggest how in the presence of high gravitational fields gravity can act repulsively and pressures can turn negative towards the end of collapse . therefore",
    "if that is the case then the equation of state relating pressure and density ( which is always positive ) must evolve in a non - trivial manner during collapse .",
    "typically we can expect an adiabatic behaviour with small adiabatic index at the beginning of collapse when the energy density is lower than the nuclear saturation energy .",
    "it is not unrealistic to suppose that the equation of state will have sharp transitions when matter passes from one regime to another , as is the case when the limit of the nuclear saturation energy is exceeded . towards the end of collapse repulsive forces",
    "become relevant thus giving rise to negative pressures and the speed of sound approaches the speed of light @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to analyze the structure of collapse model within one specific regime once a fixed equation of state , of astrophysical relevance , is imposed .",
    "if we choose the equation of state to be linear barotropic or polytropic we can describe collapse of the star right after it departs from the equilibrium configuration where gravity was balanced by the nuclear reactions taking places at its center . from an astrophysical point of view , neglecting the energy coming from the nuclear reactions occurring at the interior is reasonable since we know that once the nuclear fuel of the star is exhausted the star is subject to its own gravity only and the departure from equilibrium occurs in a very short time . in this sense equilibrium models for stars ( such as the early models studied in the pioneering work by chandrasekhar @xcite )",
    "constitute the initial configuration of our collapse model and the physical parameters used to construct those equilibrium models will translate into the initial conditions for density and pressure .    as we mentioned before ,",
    "introducing an equation of state is enough to ensure that the system of einstein equations is closed and so no freedom to specify any function remains .",
    "in fact a barotropic equation of state of the form , @xmath421 introduces a differential equation that must be satisfied by the mass function @xmath109 , thus providing the connection between equation and equation and making them dependent on @xmath422 and its derivatives only .",
    "the dynamics is entirely determined by the initial configuration and therefore we see how solving the equation of motion is enough to solve the whole system of equations .    in this case solving the differential equation for @xmath48 might prove to be too complicated . nevertheless with the assumption",
    "that @xmath48 can be expanded in a power series as in equation we can obtain a series of differential equations for each order @xmath81 . expanding the pressure and density near the center",
    "we obtain explicitly the differential equations that , if they can be satisfied by all @xmath81 converging to a finite mass function @xmath48 , solve the problem , thus giving the explicit form of @xmath48 .    from @xmath423 with @xmath424 and from einstein equations and",
    "we get @xmath425 with @xmath426 once again we see that without the knowledge of @xmath116 , which is related to @xmath427 , it is impossible to solve the set of differential equations in full generality",
    ". furthermore we can see that whenever pressures and density can be expanded in a power series near the center the behaviour close to @xmath30 approaches that of an homogeneous perfect fluid .",
    "there are a few equations of state that have been widely studied in equilibrium models for stars and that naturally translate into collapse models .",
    "the simplest one is a linear equation of state of the form @xmath428 where @xmath429 is a constant .",
    "this case was studied in @xcite where it was shown the existence of a solution of the differential equation for @xmath48 , which , from einstein equations and becomes @xmath430m_{,v}=0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] it was shown that both black holes and naked singularities are possible outcomes of collapse depending on the initial data and the velocity distribution of the particles .    another possibility is given by a polytropic equation of state of the type @xmath431 such an equation of state is often used in models for stars at equilibrium and can describe the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath8 in the early stages of collapse . therefore the physical values for @xmath432 , @xmath433 , @xmath429 and @xmath434 at the initial time can be taken from such models at equilibrium and expressed in terms of the thermodynamical quantities of the system such as the temperature and the molecular weight of the gas .",
    "the pressure is typically divided in a matter part ( describing an ideal gas ) and a radiation part ( related to the temperature ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath434 is generally written as @xmath435 , where @xmath0 is called polytropic index of the system and is constrained by @xmath436 ( for @xmath437 the cloud has no boundary at equilibrium ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the formalism developed above can therefore be used to investigate such realistic scenarios for collapse of massive stars .",
    "we have studied here the general structure of complete gravitational collapse of a sphere composed of perfect fluid without a priori requiring an equation of state for the matter constituents , thus allowing for the freedom to choose the mass function arbitrarily , as long as physical reasonableness as imposed by regularity and energy conditions is satisfied .",
    "the interest of such an analysis comes from the fact that the class of perfect fluid models for matter is considered to be physically viable for the description of realistic objects in nature such as massive stars and their gravitational collapse .",
    "typically perfect fluids are considered to be physically more sound than models where matter is approximated by dust - like behaviour _ i.e. _ without pressures , or where matter is sustained by only tangential pressures ( though the ` einstein cluster ' describing a spherical cloud of counter - rotating particles has been shown to have some non - trivial physical validity @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "what we have shown is that , within the class of perfect fluid collapses , both final outcomes , namely black holes and naked singularities , can be equally possible depending on the choice of the initial data and the free function @xmath15 .",
    "in fact our results show that naked singularities and black holes are both possible final states of collapse , much in the same way as it has already been proven in the simpler cases of inhomogeneous dust and matter exhibiting only tangential stresses .",
    "the sets of initial data leading to either of the outcomes share the same properties in terms of genericity and stability .",
    "the structure of initial data sets in the case of osd , ltb and pressure collapse and their inter - relationship is , however , a complicated issue .",
    "nevertheless , we can comment on this based on the studies in @xcite , @xcite , and the results proved in sections [ perturbation ] and [ genericity ] in this paper . in @xcite it was proven that the space of initial data @xmath438",
    "leading ltb collapse to black hole or naked singularity forms an open subset of @xmath439 , where @xmath278 is the infinite dimensional banach space of real @xmath294 functions defined on the domain . as per the analogous results in the case of non - vanishing tangential pressures it follows that the initial data set leading the collapse to osd black holes is a non - generic subset of space of @xmath440 .",
    "the shortcoming of the tangential pressure case being that is not wholly physically satisfactory . therefore to investigate the perfect fluid case , we moved to a ` bigger ' space @xmath441 , since the initial data set comprises of @xmath442 . thus , in this space , the initial data set @xmath443 or @xmath444 or the union of both the sets , will become non - generic .",
    "mathematically speaking , this set is meager or nowhere dense in the space @xmath441 .",
    "this is proved by the study performed here .",
    "thus , the initial configurations for the end states in the case of ltb or osd models lie on the critical surface separating the two possible outcomes of collapse as discussed above .",
    "this analysis in fact shows how the structure of einstein equations is very rich and complex , and how the introduction of pressures in the collapsing cloud opens up a lot of new possibilities that , while showing many interesting dynamical behaviours , do not rule out either of the two possible final outcomes .",
    "there are physical reasons , however , for the perfect fluid model to be subdued to the choice of an equation of state and there is also increasing evidence that such an equation of state can not hold during the whole duration of the dynamical collapse .",
    "in fact there are indications that as the collapsing matter approaches the singularity large negative pressures arise , thus making the equation of state relating density to pressures depart from usual well - known equations of stellar equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless the study of similar scenarios with linear or polytropic equations of state can give insights in the initial stages of collapse of a star .",
    "all this is very important from astrophysical point of view where still little is known of the processes that happen towards the very end of the life of a star , when in a catastrophic supernova explosion the outer layers are expelled and the inner core collapses under its own gravity .",
    "as we mentioned , due to the intrinsic complexity of einstein equations for perfect fluid collapse , it is generally possible to solve the system of equations only under some simplifying assumptions ( like the choice of a specific mass function ) , and only close to the center of the cloud .",
    "the indications provided by the present analysis are then a first step towards a better understanding of what happens in the last stages of the complete gravitational collapse of a realistic massive body .",
    "furthermore the above formalism could possibly be used as the framework upon which to develop possible numerical simulations of gravitational collapse . as seen in the comoving frame , the positivity of @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 ) ) is the necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity to be visible , at least locally .",
    "numerical models of a collapsing star made of a perfect fluid with a polytropic equation of state ( or a varying equation of state that takes into account the phase transitions that occur in matter under strong gravitational fields ) , with the addition of rotation and possibly electromagnetic field might help us better understand whether the inner ultradense region that forms at the center of the collapsing cloud when the apparent horizon is delayed , might be visible globally and have some effects on the outside universe .",
    "many numerical models that describe dynamical evolutions leading to the formation of black holes exist both in gravitational collapse as in merger of compact objects such as neutron stars ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but a fully comprehensive picture of what happens in the final moments of the life of a star is still far away .",
    "close to the formation of the singularity , gravitationally repulsive effects , possibly due to some quantum gravitational corrections , are likely to take place .",
    "if such phenomena can interact with the outer layers of the collapsing cloud they might create a window to the physics of high gravitational fields whose effects might be visible to faraway observers . this scenario might in turn imply the visibility of the planck scale physics or new physics close to the singularity , the presence of a quantum wall that might cause shock - waves from within the schwarzschild radius that might give rise to different type of emissions and explosions , with photons or high energy particles escaping from the ultradense region .",
    "collisions of particles with arbitrarily high center of mass energy near the cauchy horizon might also happen @xcite .    overall , the analysis led over the past few years seems to suggest that the oppenheimer - snyder - datt scenario is indeed too restrictive to account for the richness of realistic dynamical models in general relativity .",
    "the occurrence of naked singularities in gravitational collapse appears to be a well established fact and a lot of intriguing new physics might arise from the future study of more detailed collapse models .",
