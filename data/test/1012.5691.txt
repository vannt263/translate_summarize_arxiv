    "a similar anomalous eruption was observed in the 13.07.2004 event @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of this event revealed an eruption from an active region of a compact filament and its subsequent dispersion over a huge area comparable with a quarter of the visible solar disk .",
    "these events were accompanied with impulsive flares .",
    "eruptive events associated with flares produce various phenomena of different temporal and spatial scales .",
    "these phenomena are observed in diverse spectral domains ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these are flare arcades whose emission is registered from x - rays up to radio waves .",
    "other phenomena are dimmings , i.e. , depressions of soft x - ray and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) emissions that reach significant sizes and exist from a few hours up to two days .",
    "the major cause of quasi - stationary dimmings is plasma density decrease due to expansion of eruptive structures .",
    "shock waves excited by impulsive eruptions from active regions are manifest in moreton waves and some `` euv waves '' ( or `` eit waves '' ) .",
    "propagation of shock waves is traced from slowly drifting type ii bursts at metric and decimetric waves .",
    "most likely , shock waves form leading edges of fast cmes , especially decelerating ones @xcite .    erupted plasmas with nearly chromospheric temperatures can occult some part of the solar emission and absorb its detectable fraction .",
    "absorption phenomena are observed in various emission ranges . erupted plasmas show up in the h@xmath3 line mainly as surges , which are usually not large in size . in rare cases moving clots",
    "can be detected far from an eruption site @xcite .",
    "observations of eruptions in the h@xmath3 line are limited by the doppler shift , which displaces them from the filter band even if the line - of - sight velocities are rather low .",
    "other causes also rapidly decrease the optical thickness of eruptions in the course of their expansion .",
    "absorption phenomena are also manifest in radio emission as the so - called `` negative bursts '' , i.e. , a temporary decrease of the total radio flux below the quasi - stationary level observed beyond bursts @xcite .",
    "the optical thickness of eruptions in microwaves is proportional to the wavelength squared . unlike the h@xmath3 line , both static and eruptive filaments can be optically thick practically in the whole microwave range , and they cause appreciable depressions of the emission .",
    "absorption of the background solar emission due to photo - ionization occurs also in the euv range .",
    "filaments are sometimes observed as dark features in coronal emission euv lines fe  ix - x 171    and fe  xii 195    ( often with a sheath brightened during eruption ) , while dense parts of eruptive filaments can appear as low - contrast moving fragmentary dimmings .",
    "absorption can be especially significant in the he  ii 304  line , because the cross section of photo - ionization by such an emission of hydrogen - helium plasma with a nearly chromospheric temperature is by an order of magnitude higher than that for the 195    line .",
    "in addition , resonance scattering is possible in the he  ii 304    line by plasma with a temperature of a few @xmath4  k typical of the transition region ( both between the corona and chromosphere and between the corona and a prominence ) .",
    "the temperature sensitivity maximum of the 304    channel is 80000  k. due to these properties , material of an eruptive filament , whose temperature range can be sufficiently wide , might have either increased or reduced brightness in this line . finally , erupted plasma can be also observed in the he  i 10830    line , which responds to both chromospheric and coronal phenomena .",
    "these circumstances show that phenomena of long - lasting occultation of the background solar emission can be observed in the he  ii 304    line and in radio emission in a range of 110 ghz @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite analyzed eruptive events , for which records of negative bursts at a number of frequencies were available .",

    "nevertheless , by taking account of data from different emission ranges it is clear that the decrease of the total radio flux was caused not only by possible occultation of microwave sources in an active region , but also by screening of large quiet sun s regions .",
    "no alternative to the eruption is seen for the role of the screen .",
    "these observational facts show that one or more filament eruptions in the 29.04.1998 event were followed by disintegration of the filament s magnetic structure and dispersing fragments over significant area above the solar surface .",
    "they occulted the background solar emission that caused the negative burst and the long - lasting large - scale darkening visible in the 304    channel without pronounced analogs in coronal lines ( although faint manifestations of absorption were detectable in this region in the 195    images ) .",

    "the three events considered in our paper as well as five events analyzed previously in papers show that the most probable cause of depressions of radio emission observed as `` negative bursts '' was absorption of background solar emission in low - temperature plasmas of eruptive filaments .",

    "just this interpretation of `` negative bursts '' was initially proposed by covington @xcite and confirmed in most later studies @xcite .",
    "an essential result of the analysis carried out in studies as well as in the present paper is the conclusion about very large areas of occulting screens , from 2% to 15% of the visible solar disk .",
    "it turns out that not only occultation of compact sources in active regions is important , but also occultation of large quiet sun s areas .",
    "huge sizes of occulting screens are in agreement with a maximum thickness of about 200  mm estimated from observations of one of such events @xcite as well as heights of their lower edges of 2080  mm above the chromosphere estimated by means of the model .    in order to produce an appreciable depression of radio emission",
    ", an eruptive filament must have a sufficient contrast against the background of the quiet sun with a brightness temperature of @xmath33 , while the corona must be optically thin .",
    "these conditions are mainly satisfied within a frequency range from 1  ghz ( @xmath34  k ) to 10  ghz ( @xmath35  k ) , in which negative bursts in mentioned studies have been actually registered .",
    "observations of negative bursts beyond this frequency range appear to be possible in some cases . however , with the estimated temperatures of screens of @xmath36  k , frequencies below 5  ghz ( @xmath37  k ) are favorable .",
    "indeed , depressions in all eight cases were deepest at frequencies of 24  ghz , and the fact that covington discovered negative bursts in observations at a traditional wave of 10.7  cm ( 2.8 ghz ) does not seem to be surprising .",
    "as noticed in introduction , the he  ii 304    line of the euv range is another spectral domain , which favors detection of large - scale ejections of low - temperature plasmas of eruptive filaments due to absorption .",
    "this is due to a high cross section of photo - ionization by this emission and the existence of an additional mechanism , resonance scattering of emission by plasmas with temperatures of a few @xmath38  k. for these reasons , depressions caused by absorption of the he  ii 304    line emission are not visible or scarcely detectable in coronal emission lines , unlike deep dimmings caused by plasma density decrease due to a cme expansion .",
    "it is therefore clear that observations of such darkenings in the he  ii 304    line correlate with negative radio bursts .",
    "note that the depressions observed in the he  ii 304    line in the considered events 13 were significantly deeper than the 50%-level expected for resonance scattering ( see @xcite ) that confirms predominance of low temperatures in occulting screens .",
    "however , significant differences exist between absorption properties in the microwave range , on the one hand , and in the he  ii 304    line , on the other hand . the major difference is determined by dissimilar density dependence of the optical thickness of an absorbing screen .",
    "the microwave optical thickness , @xmath39 , rapidly decreases in omnidirectional expansion of a screen , if the number of particles responsible for absorption remains constant in the screen .",
    "the situation is different when dealing with absorption in the he  ii line . by neglecting temperature effects and other ones , on",
    "can consider in the first approximation the optical thickness to depend on the first power of density , @xmath40 , and the role of the expansion factor is significantly weaker . even if a screen expands dissimilarly in different directions",
    ", the density decrease factor dominates in the radio range .",
    "the second distinction is due to differences between layers responsible for emissions registered in the 304    channel , on the one hand , and in microwaves , on the other hand . the background solar emission in the 304    line is most likely dominated by contribution from the transition region , i.e. , at very low altitudes ( @xmath41  mm ) .",
    "the contribution from coronal layers is presumably dominated by the si  xi line emission .",
    "it does not seem to be significant in quiet regions .",
    "the situation is different in the radio range .",
    "the quiet sun s brightness temperature observed from the earth consists of two components , the chromospheric emission ( @xmath42  k ) and the coronal one . unlike the 304    channel",
    ", the corona contribution in microwaves exceeds the chromospheric one at frequencies below 4.4  ghz .",
    "this contribution gradually increases with a rise from the chromosphere upwards .",
    "therefore , the height of an absorbing screen above the chromosphere is very important .",
    "for example , the presence at a large height of an opaque , dense ( for simplicity ) screen with a temperature of 14000  k decreases a low - frequency total radio flux and increases a high - frequency one .",
    "by contrast , a very low screen with the same parameters but the temperature of 10000  k would not manifest in radio emission at all .",
    "however , a darkening in the 304    channel is expected to be the same in both cases",
    ". one might expect for these reasons that a negative burst should typically terminate earlier than a darkening in the 304  channel disappears .",
    "the latter might be visible as long as an absorbing screen is located higher than the transition region .",
    "thus , phenomena of long - lasting screening of the background solar emission can be observed in the he  ii 304    line as well as in radio emission of the 110  ghz range ( preferably below 5  ghz ) .",
    "however , soho / eit supplies , as a rule , one 304    image in six hours , and therefore the probability to register such a phenomenon is low .",
    "stereo and sdo space - borne observatories carry out observations in the 304    channels in more detail , but they operate during a prolonged minimum of the solar activity . out of very few heliographs ,",
    "the ssrt @xcite is the only one , which routinely observes the sun in the frequency range of interest during the whole light day .",
    "however , screening phenomena after flare - related eruptions have not been detected in its observations so far .",
    "probably , this is due to both infrequent occurrence of such events and an insufficient sensitivity of this instrument that is required for their detection at its rather high frequency of 5.7  ghz ( @xmath43  k ) in the presence of bright flare emissions .",
    "total radio flux records persist to be the main source about such events , but their detection in such records is obviously preconditioned by a short duration of a preceding flare and the absence of bursts afterwards . for all of these reasons ,",
    "information about such events is very limited .",
    "the brightness decrease of solar disk portions below the quasi - stationary level in the discussed events was caused by absorption of a fraction of the solar emission in a cool screen .",
    "plasmas of eruptive filaments ( prominences ) constitute such screens .",
    "two scenarios of screening are possible . in the first case ,",
    "the shape and magnetic structure of an eruptive filament do not undergo essential changes .",
    "such a filament draws away from the solar surface almost without loss of its mass and looks like a moving screen , whose sizes increase , while the opacity decreases . our event 2 ( 27/28.05.2003 ) is a possible example of such a scenario .",
    "this scenario is typical of non - flare - related filament eruptions outside of active regions .",
    "many such events have been observed with ssrt and the nobeyama radioheliograph ( frequencies of 17 and 34 ghz ) . in the second scenario ,",
    "the whole mass of an eruptive filament or its considerable portion does not leave the sun as a part of a cme , but is dispersed over a large area above the solar surface .",
    "this presumably occurred in event 1 ( 29.04.1998 ) , and also in the 13.07.2004 event @xcite .",
    "this scenario is not excluded also for event 3 ( 01.01.2005 ) .",
    "dispersion occurs along magnetic field lines , which probably were not connected with the filament before the eruption .",
    "transposition of cool plasmas of the eruptive filament to the external field lines is possible in reconnection of magnetic fluxes of the internal field belonging to the filament and the external one .",
    "one may speak in this case about `` destruction '' of the magnetic structure of the eruptive filament . afterwards , the ejecta does not resemble itself as it at the onset of the eruption was .",
    "an example is the 18.11.2003 event mentioned above , in which an eruptive filament encountered an invisible obstacle and visually transformed into two wide diverging jets carrying material of the filament to remote sites on the solar surface .",
    "it is a subject of a separate analysis how `` destruction '' of the magnetic structure of an eruptive filament occurs .",
    "now we only indicate possible causes .",
    "the first one has been confirmed by observations .",
    "its essence is a pass of an eruptive filament through a null point of the magnetic field in the corona ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indications at essentially three - dimensional nature of an occurring transformation of an eruptive filament into eruptive jet can be found in papers .",
    "another reason of allied nature might be a pass of an eruptive filament across vicinities of a point , in which loci of neutral lines of the radial magnetic component bifurcate .",
    "such a region can be revealed from the arrangement of neutral lines of the large - scale magnetic field calculated at different heights above the solar surface .",
    "a rising eruptive filament is known to successively reproduce in its motion contours of the same neutral line changing with height .",
    "this lines breaks in a bifurcation point , and the filament has no chance to retain its integrity after passing through such a region .",
    "we found a similar bifurcation of the height distribution of neutral lines in the mentioned 18.11.2003 event , which will be analyzed in a separate paper .",
    "an anomalous eruption with a `` destruction '' of the filament s magnetic structure is favored by the appearance in real solar conditions of null points and bifurcation points on the way of a filament .",
    "this is more probable in a complex coronal magnetic configuration , inside which the eruption occurs .",
    "outer manifestations of such a situation are complexity of a configuration observed on the photosphere ( all the three considered events occurred in @xmath44-configurations ) and/or surrounding of the eruption region by other active regions ( this was the case for events considered in @xcite ) .",
    "these circumstances correspond to a conclusion of sawyer ( @xcite , item 4 in ` summary and conclusions ' ) about a tendency of negative bursts to clustering in complexes of active regions . for the same reasons , an anomalous eruption of a quiescent filament beyond an activity complex",
    "is not expected .",
    "after eruptions occurring outside of active regions , one might expect occultation of the solar emission by an expanding filament , but its `` destruction '' is unlikely .",
    "all the considered events were indeed associated with filament eruptions from active regions accompanied by pronouncedly impulsive flares .",
    "this is also supported by the appearance of coronal shock waves in the events .",
    "observations suggest that excitation of a shock wave in the low corona is most probable by the impulsive - piston mechanism in an eruption of a magnetic flux rope structure @xcite .",
    "then the shock wave detaches from the piston , which excited it , runs ahead , and freely propagates afterwards like a blast wave .",
    "the front of such a wave has a shape close to a spheroid .",
    "near - surface signatures of such shock waves can be moreton waves and those `` eit waves '' , which propagate far away from an eruption region .",
    "signatures of shock waves propagating away from the solar surface are metric type ii bursts and outer edges of coronal transients of a halo type .",
    "kinematical correspondence of all of these manifestations has been shown in the same study @xcite as well as a low probability of other discussed excitation mechanisms of shock wave excitation near the sun .",
    "observations of all the three considered events have revealed type ii radio bursts in the metric range , `` eit waves '' propagating up to large distance from eruption regions , and indications of a moreton wave in event 2 . sufficiently fast ( average speeds @xmath45  km / s ) halo coronal transients",
    "were associated with all the events , and all of them decelerated .",
    "an additional hint at a wave character of these transients is a significant difference between the expansion directions of their fastest parts and the major cme magnetoplasma structures .",
    "a trace of a spheroid front of a coronal shock wave is expected to be observed just in this manner .",
    "we have demonstrated manifestations in different spectral ranges of eruptive events associated with powerful flares followed by long - lasting screening of the solar emission .",
    "absorption of the background emission in material of an eruptive filament can be observed as a depression of the he  ii 304    line emission without pronounced counterparts in euv emission lines .",
    "it can be also observed as a negative radio burst in the microwave range .",
    "darkenings in images obtained in the he  ii 304    channel can be detectable well after the end of a corresponding negative radio burst . from high - quality multi - frequency microwave data by means of the model developed , it is possible to estimate parameters ( including mass ) of ejected material , whose projection is on the solar disk .",
    "such estimates have confirmed that screening occurred by material of an eruptive filament and showed that , besides occultation of emission from compact sources in active regions , occultation of significant quiet sun s areas is significant .",
    "a steadily expanding eruptive filament is known to be able to occult the solar emission during tens of minutes or even a few hours .",
    "observations show that in some cases , which are presumably rare , an eruption scenario can be anomalous .",
    "that is , an eruptive filament encounters an unavoidable obstacle in a form of a peculiarity of the coronal magnetic configuration and disintegrates into parts or a cloud of fragments .",
    "in such a case , material of an eruptive filament does not join a cme , but instead is dispersed over a large area above the solar surface and eventually lands far from the eruption region .",
    "being aware of only a few examples of such events , it is difficult to judge about their common properties .",
    "we can only present some conjectures .",
    "an anomalous eruption is expected to be favored by complexities of a magnetic configuration , especially of the @xmath46 type , and surrounding of the active region with others .",
    "such an eruption might be accompanied by a significantly power flare , surges , or sprays .",
    "surges observed in the h@xmath3 line might sometimes present only the slowest and densest part of an eruption , whose real sizes can be significantly larger . in an anomalous eruption ,",
    "appearance of a shock wave is highly probable , which can manifest in a metric type ii burst , `` euv wave '' propagating far from the eruption region , and a possible moreton wave .",
    "the shock wave might be responsible for the leading edge of a coronal transient originating in such an event .",
    "the cme can be without a pronounced core .",
    "the outer cme edge might be either formed by a shock - driven plasma flow or constituted by coronal rays deflected by the wave .",
    "such a coronal transient probably has a high speed and decelerates .",
    "a number of listed properties appears to be typical of many flare - related eruptions .",
    "if such an event is followed by a negative radio burst or a large darkening observed in the 304  channel that conspicuously mismatches dimmings visible in coronal lines , then an anomalous eruption might have occurred in this event .",
