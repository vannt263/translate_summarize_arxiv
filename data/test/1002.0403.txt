    "this discrepancy between the observed shapes of dm halos and the predictions from numerical simulations has become known as the `` cusp / core '' problem .",

    "this galaxy is classified as a nearby ( @xmath11  3.78  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) blue compact dwarf according to its optical appearance , yet has the  morphology of a late - type spiral .",
    "detailed imaging by @xcite showed that the optical appearance of ngc  2915 is dominated by two main stellar populations : a compact blue population , which is the location of on - going high - mass star formation ; and a more diffuse , older red population .",
    "what makes this galaxy so interesting is the fact that , when observed at 21  cm , the stellar core of ngc  2915 is seen to be completely embedded in a huge  disk extending out to @xmath12  22 @xmath1-band scale lengths @xcite .",

    "they calculated a common , slow pattern speed of @xmath19  which they associated with the figure rotation of a tri - axial dm halo .",
    "they also proposed that some dm is distributed in the disk of ngc  2915 , thereby making it gravitationally unstable to the formation of the observed spiral structure .",
    "@xcite , using hydrodynamical simulations , further explored the ideas of @xcite .",
    "they showed that the observed spiral structure can be accounted for by either an unseen bar or a rotating tri - axial dm halo .",
    "however , the mass of the required bar , @xmath20  , is very large in comparison to the total stellar mass , thereby making the nature of such a bar problematic .",
    "the required pattern speed of the tri - axial dm halo is significantly larger than those from numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite disfavoured the external perturber scenario .",
    "they also found that while a heavy disk is able to account for the main features of the observed  morphology , it fails to match the observed gas dynamics .",
