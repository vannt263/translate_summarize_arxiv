    "very soon , experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will begin direct exploration of physics at the tev scale .",
    "strong theoretical arguments suggest that this physics will include new particles and forces not present in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "several theoretically motivated extensions of the standard model at the tev scale have been proposed .",
    "after new physics discovery at the lhc , the main task of the experiments will be to determine which of the proposed models , if any , is correct .    unfortunately , there exists a broad and well - motivated class of sm extensions for which this task would be highly non - trivial . in these models ,",
    "the new tev - scale particles carry a new conserved quantum number , not carried by the sm states .",
    "the lightest of the new particles is therefore stable .",
    "furthermore , the stable particle interacts weakly , providing a very attractive `` weakly interacting massive particle '' ( wimp ) candidate for dark matter with relic abundance naturally in the observed range .",
    "models of this class include the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and a variety of other supersymmetric models with conserved r parity , little higgs models with t parity ( lht ) , and models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) with kaluza - klein ( kk ) parity .",
    "all these models have a common signature at a hadron collider : pair - production of new states is followed by their prompt decay into visible sm states and the lightest new particle , which escapes the detector without interactions leading to a `` missing transverse energy '' signature .",
    "if this universal signature is observed at the lhc , how does one determine which of these models is realized ?",
    "one crucial difference between the mssm and models such as lht or ued is the correlation between spins of the new particles and their gauge charges . in all these models ,",
    "all ( or many of ) the new states at the tev scale can be paired up with the known sm particles , with particles in the same pair carrying identical gauge charges . however , while in the lht and ued models the two members of the pair have the same spin , in the mssm and other supersymmetric models their spins differ by 1/2 .",
    "thus , measuring the spin of the observed new particles provides a way to discriminate among models .    experimental determination of the spin of a heavy unstable particle with one or more invisible daughter(s ) in hadron collider environment is a difficult task .",
    "one possibile approach , which recently received considerable attention in the literature  @xcite , is to use angular correlations between the observable particles emitted in subsequent steps of a cascade decay , which are sensitive to intermediate particle spins .",
    "this strategy is promising , but its success depends on the availability of long cascade decay chains , which may or may not occur depending on the details of the new physics spectrum .",
    "it is worth thinking about other possible strategies for spin determination .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of using 3-body decays of heavy new particles to determine their spin .",
    "the most interesting example is the 3-body decay of the mssm gluino into a quark - antiquark pair and a weak gaugino , q+|q+ . in a large part of the mssm parameter space",
    ", this decay has a large branching ratio : this occurs whenever all squarks are heavier than the gluino . , which first arises at one - loop level and generically has a partial width comparable to the tree - level decay  .",
    "the gluino decay patterns in this parameter region have been analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "] under the same condition , gluino pair - production dominates susy signal at the lhc .",
    "we will argue that the invariant mass distribution of the jets produced in reaction   contains non - trivial information about the gluino spin , and can be used to distinguish this process from , for example , its ued counterpart , @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to note that the jet invariant mass distribution we study depends not just on the spin of the decaying particle , but also on the helicity structure of the couplings which appear in the decay  , as well as on the masses of the decaying particle , the invisible daughter , and the off - shell particles mediating the decay .",
    "if all these parameters were measured independently , the jet invariant mass distribution would unambiguously determine the spin .",
    "however , independent determination of many of the relevant parameters will be very difficult or impossible at the lhc .",
    "in this situation , proving the spin-1/2 nature of the decaying particle requires demonstrating that the experimentally observed curve can not be fitted with any of the curves predicted by models with other spin assignments , independently of the values of the unknown parameters .",
    "this considerably complicates our task .",
    "still , interesting information can be extraced .",
    "for example , we will show that , even if complete ignorance of the decaying and intermediate particle masses is assumed , the jet invariant mass distribution allows one to distinguish between the decay   in the mssm and its ued counterpart ( assuming the couplings specified by each model ) at the lhc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after setting up our notation and reviewing the basics of three - body kinematics in section 2",
    ", we present a simple toy model showing how dijet invariant mass distributions from three - body decays can be used to probe the nature of the decaying particle and its couplings in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses using this observable for mssm / ued discrimination , and contains the main results of the paper .",
    "section 5 contains the conclusions .",
    "appendix a contains the polarization analysis of the decay @xmath3 in ued , which sheds some light on the main features of the dijet invariant mass distribution in this case .",

    ". the main focus of this paper will be on the case when @xmath4 is the gluino of the mssm or the kk gluon of the ued model , and @xmath5 is a neutalino or chargino of the mssm or a kk electroweak gauge boson of the ued ; however the discussion in this section applies more generally .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are massless , and denote their four - momenta by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . to describe the kinematics in lorentz - invariant terms , we introduce the `` mandelstam variables '' , s & = & ( p_1+p_2)^2 = ( p_a - p_b)^2 , u & = & ( p_1+p_b)^2 = ( p_a - p_2)^2 , t & = & ( p_2+p_b)^2 = ( p_a - p_1)^2 , of which only two are independent since s+t+u = m_a^2 + m_b^2 .",

    "we will assume that @xmath10 can not be reconstructed , either because @xmath5 is unobservable or is unstable with all decays containing unobservable daughters .",
    "moreover , since the parton center - of - mass frame is unknown , no information is available about the motion of particle @xmath4 in the lab frame . due to these limitations ,",
    "the analysis should use observables that can be reconstructed purely by measuring the jet four - momenta , and are independent of the velocity of @xmath4 in the lab frame .",

    "the distributions are normalized to have the same total number of events , since the overall normalization is subject to large systematic uncertainties and we do not use any normalization information in our study .",
    "note that for each mc event , we include all @xmath98 possible jet pairings ; 4 out of these correspond to combining jets that do _ not _ come from the same decay , and thus do not follow the theoretical distributions computed above . in fig .",

    "[ fig : mg ] that even after realistic cuts   and the combinatoric background are included , the distributions in the two models retain their essential shape difference expected from the simplified theoretical analysis of the previous section . assuming that the experimental data is described by the mssm histogram and ignoring systematic uncertainties , we find ( using the standard @xmath100 test ) that about 750 events would be required to rule out the ued curve at the 99.9% c.l .",
    "note that this number is smaller than those obtained in the previous section , indicating that the performed cuts actually enhance the difference between the mssm and ued distributions .",
    "on the other hand , the actual discriminating power of the analysis is likely to be somewhat lower than this estimate , since the systematic uncertainty in the cut efficiencies was not taken into account here .",
    "our parton - level analysis does not explicitly take into account the smearing effect due to the finite jet energy and direction resolution of a real detector .",

    "the production cross section for the color - octet state at the lhc is expected to be large , and the branching ratio for the three - body decays is significant whenever all squarks / kk quarks are heavier than the gluino / kk gluon . if this is the case , the dijet invariant mass distribution can be determined accurately at the lhc .",
    "the main complication of the analysis is that the distributions in the two models we considered depend on a number of parameters in addition to the spin of the decaying particle .",
    "however , even allowing for complete ignorance of these parameters , we found the dijet invariant mass to be a very promising tool for model discrimination .",
    "the simplified analysis of this paper did not take into account a number of potentially important effects .",
    "since the particles involved are colored , the qcd loop corrections to the decay amplitudes are expected to be significant , and may modify the tree - level distributions we studied .",
    "also , our analysis is performed at the parton level and does not include detector effects . while we expect that many systematic effects would cancel out since the analysis relies only on the shapes of the distributions and is insensitive to the overall normalization , a better understanding of the systematics is required .",
