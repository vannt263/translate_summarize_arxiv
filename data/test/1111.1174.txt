    "one of the most rarer processes of the nature , the double beta decay has unambiguous importance in explicitly linking nuclear structure aspects with neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "nuclear double beta decay is a second order process which involved electroweak decay of two nucleons simultaneously .",
    "the two neutrino mode of double beta decay is a second order process and allowed in standard model .",
    "it has been detected for nearly a dozen of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the correct theoretical description of these observations serves as a test of various nuclear models and also a necessary step to understand the neutrinoless mode .",
    "the extraction of information is essentially dependent upon the prediction of nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntmes ) involved in these processes .",
    "the difference in the configurations of the nucleons between initial and final states is a major ingredient of the matrix elements .",
    "the ntmes contain the wave function of the initial even - even nucleus in its @xmath2 ground state and the wave function of the final nucleus ( usually @xmath2 ground state but some time also excited @xmath3 and @xmath2 states ) .",
    "these wave functions are connected by proper operators . in case of two neutrino mode the summation over all @xmath4 states of the intermediate odd - odd nuclei",
    "is required where as for neutrinoless decay the summation over the complete set of the states of intermediate nucleus is needed .",
    "therefore it will be necessary to evaluate the structure of the initial , final and intermediate nuclei explicitly .    the most of the nuclei undergoing double beta decay are medium or heavy mass region and all of them are even even type , in which pairing degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "moreover it has been conjectured that the deformation plays a crucial role in double beta transitions .",
    "hence it is desirable to have a model in which pairing and deformation degrees of freedom treated on equal footing in its formalism . the shell model , which attempts to solve the nuclear many - body problems as exactly as possible , is always being the best choice for model calculations .",
    "however , for most of the double beta decaying nuclei the full scale shell model calculations are not feasible and the reliability of theoretical predictions has been hampered by unstabilities in case of bcs+rpa type treatment .",
    "for this purpose the angular momentum projected deformed hartree - fock ( dhf ) model is one of the most convenient choices .",
    "the dhf formalism , the pairing interaction is taken into account by mixing particle - hole excitations ( 2p-2h,4p-4h etc ) of @xmath5 type across the fermi surfaces over the hf ground state and deformation effects are included in a self - consistent way .",
    "moreover it has been shown @xcite that it is possible to get shell model results with angular momentum projected dhf calculation by mixing only a few intrinsic configurations built by suitable particle - hole excitations across proton and neutron fermi surfaces .",
    "here we have used microscopic many - body self consistent model based on deformed hartree - fock procedure and subsequent angular momentum projection technique for a reliable description of the nuclear structure of some medium as well heavy nuclei participating in double beta decay processes in the mass range @xmath0 to @xmath6 .",
    "since our aim is to study the low - lying spectroscopic properties of the nuclei , we have not incorporated the coulomb effect in our calculations .",
    "the inclusion of coulomb effect will not change the energy spectra and electromagnetic matrix elements of individual nucleus rather it will change the energy difference between two nuclei .    in the present article we briefly discuss about the theoretical formalism in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the discussion about the results obtained from this paper .",
    "the conclusions are finally given in section 4 .",
    "in this section we present briefly the model used for the microscopic calculations .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "our model consists of self - consistent deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with a surface delta residual interaction and subsequent angular momentum projection to obtain states with good angular momentum .",
    "the axially deformed states @xmath7 are expanded in the spherical basis states as follows : @xmath8 where j is the angular momentum of the spherical single particle state and m its projection on symmetry axis .",
    "the mixing amplitude @xmath9 are obtained by solving deformed hartree - fock equations in an iterative process .",
    "when the convergence in the hf solutions is obtained we get deformed single particle orbits . the residual interaction is also included self - consistently and it causes the mixing of single - particle orbits of nucleons .    because of mixing in single particle orbits , the hf configurations @xmath10 are superposition of states of good angular momentum .",
    "the states of good angular momentum can be extracted by means of projection operator @xcite    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the rotation operator @xmath13 and @xmath14 represents the euler angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian overlap between two states of angular momentum j projected from intrinsic states @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 with @xmath21    reduced matrix elements of tensor operator t@xmath22 between projected states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 where the tensor operator @xmath26 denotes electromagnetic operators of multipolarity l.    in general , two states @xmath27 and @xmath28 projected from two intrinsic configurations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not orthogonal to each other even if the intrinsic states @xmath29 and @xmath30 are orthogonal .",
    "we orthonormalise them using following equation @xmath31 here @xmath32 are amplitude overlap and @xmath33 are the orthonormalised amplitudes , which can be identified as band - mixing amplitudes .",
    "the orthonormalised states are given by @xmath34 with these orthonormalised states we can calculate matrix elements of various tensor operators .",
    "the spectroscopic quadrupole moment of a state with angular momentum j is given by    @xmath35    where the summation is for quadrupole moment operators of protons and neutrons .    the gyromagnetic factor ( g - factor ) of state j is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnetic moment of state j. the magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath38 ) of a state with angular momentum j can be expressed as @xmath39 where i = p and n for protons and neutrons respectively . where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are orbital and spin g - factor respectively .",
    "the g - factors of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for protons and @xmath44 and @xmath45 for neutrons are used for the calculations .",
    "the quenching of spin g - factors by 0.75 is taken in account to consider the core polarization effect @xcite .",
    "the deformed hf orbits are calculated with a spherical core of @xmath46ni , the model space spans the 1@xmath47 , 0@xmath48 , 1@xmath49 , 0@xmath50 , 0@xmath51 , 0@xmath52 , 0@xmath53 , 2@xmath54 and 0@xmath55 orbits both for protons neutrons with single particle energies 0.0 , 0.78 , 1.88 , 4.44 , 8.88 , 11.47 , 10.73 , 12.21 and 13.69 mev respectively .",
    "we use a surface delta interaction @xcite ( with interaction strength @xmath560.36 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 interactions ) as the residual interaction among the active nucleons in these orbits .",
    "deformed hartree - fock and angular momentum projection calculations are performed for some medium - heavy nuclei with mass number @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in our model",
    "we can calculate the energy spectra and other electromagnetic moments for even - even parents and daughter as well as odd - odd intermediate nuclei .",
    "this is an interesting feature of our model .",
    "in contrast to psm where a large number of configurations is needed to understand low - lying yrast spectra , it is found that angular momentum projection ( amp ) from a few low - lying configurations can reasonably reproduces the yrast - spectra .",
    "sometimes the amp from single k configuration gives fairly good description of yrast structure .",
    "this is due to fact that the residual interaction is included self - consistently in the hf calculations , so that the hf configurations and various particle - hole configurations built on hf solutions are already closer to the solutions obtained from full many body schrdinger equations .",
    "the hartree - fock solutions for the parent , intermediate and daughter nuclei are given in table  [ tab : tab_hf - sol ] .",
