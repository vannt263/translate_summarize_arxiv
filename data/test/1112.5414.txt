    "topological states of matter are characterized by bulk invariants : chern numbers @xcite or by a @xmath2 invariant @xcite , depending if the time reversal symmetry is broken or conserved . due to the bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite this classification",
    "can be translated to the existence of topologically protected states at the edges of the system . in the case of the @xmath2 insulator",
    "the edge states are formed by time reversed modes , so called kramers partners and they are helical @xcite , i.e. kramers partners counter - propagate along a given edge of the sample . depending if the number of kramers pairs on the edge is even or odd , the system is topologically trivial or non - trivial . although the topological invariant is the property of the bulk , experiments usually detect edge states properties . indeed",
    "the confirmation that hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qws ) are two - dimensional topological insulators @xcite was provided through the measurement of quantized edge conductance @xcite . + one benefit of hgte / cdte qws is that the topological order can be controlled by the thickness of the hgte layer : below the critical thickness of @xmath3 the system is a trivial insulator , whereas above @xmath4 the system behaves as topological insulator .",
    "this gives the possibility to observe the topological phase transition directly .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to find further experimental measurable indicators which distinguish the two regimes .",
    "since the topological invariant is a bulk property , it seems natural that the bulk conductivity could also carry information about topological properties of the system .",
    "indeed it was proposed in ref .   that a non - monotonic conductance as a function of geometrical aspect ratio in metal / hgte / metal junctions with a characteristic maximum describes the topological insulator regime .",
    "the conductance maximum occurs when incoming metallic bulk states tunnel through a short and wide two - dimensional topological insulator and is robust against scalar disorder on the order of the energy gap @xcite .",
    "however , so far this analysis was limited to the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and neglected the existence of edge states , which can significantly modify the behavior in experimentally relevant setups . here",
    "we analyze carefully the properties of the single qshi / metal interface as well as the interplay between edge states and bulk states in metal / qshi / metal junctions .",
    "to do so we apply a generalized wave matching method based on fourier modes , like it was e.g. used to analyze two interface tunneling junctions in hgte @xcite .",
    "zhang et al . restricted themselves to a low energetic behavior around the gap , which is dominated by the linear dispersion of the bulk and the edge states .",
    "in contrast our studies combine a topological insulator with two highly doped metallic leads treated as highly doped hgte with quadratic dispersion .",
    "we show that the conductance signals originating from the bulk and the edge contributions are not additive .",
    "while for a long junction the transport is determined by the edge states contribution , for a short junction , the conductance signal is built from both bulk and edge states in the ratio which depends on the width of the sample .",
    "further , the conductance for short junctions shows a non - monotonic behavior as a function of the sample length in the topological insulator regime .",
    "surprisingly this non - monotonic behavior of conductance can be traced to the formation of an effectively propagating solution which is robust against scalar disorder .",
    "our predictions should be experimentally verifiable in hgte qws and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films .",

    "the results for the lower block then follow by trs .",
    "a generalization including a finite value of structure inversion asymmetry was presented in ref .  .",

    "[ fig : efplot ] we show the corresponding @xmath153 as a function of the @xmath152-coordinate and the fermi energy .",
    "as before we consider just one of the blocks , so that only one edge state ( spin - up ) is shown .",
    "the mini - gap as well as the bulk gap can be easily seen in this contour plot .",
    "we find that the edge state spreads over the whole sample shortly before the mini - gap opens .",
    "we have seen that the overlap of the edge state crucially influences the transport in metal / qshi / metal junctions .",
    "therefore let us note that the penetration depth of the edge state is in general a function of the energy@xcite , like it is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : efplot ] . for @xmath22 finite and smaller",
    "than zero this behavior is asymmetric . for negative energies",
    "the edge state is strongly localized at the upper sample border .",
    "the small penetration depth leads to the fact that the edge state exists also at energies outside of the energy gap . for our parameters it merges to the valence band at energies of about @xmath154 . up to this energy",
    "the strong localization ensures a good quantization which we observe in the conductance .",
    "in contrast , on the other side of the mini - gap ( @xmath155 ) the edge state is widely spread , so that a strong backscattering occurs .",
    "moreover it merges quickly to the bulk states around @xmath156 .",
    "therefore we believe that at these energies the transport is dominated by evanescent bulk states .",
    "hence in this regime the conductance resembles the shape of the pbc signal .",
    "in this section we want to analyze the robustness of the conductance signal in the presence of scalar disorder .",
    "disorder breaks the translational invariance of the sample which makes the application of the wave matching routine impossible .",
    "we go around this problem by using tight - binding calculations within the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite in the tight - binding approach we discretize the sample using a finite grid of say @xmath157 points while the hard wall boundary conditions are naturally implemented by missing bonds at the borders . in principle",
    "we could have performed the whole analysis , which we reported in this paper , using tight - binding calculations . however , to check the validity of the conclusions for the experimentally relevant setups one needs to simulate large structures .",
    "further for a good approximation within the tight - binding model one needs a small lattice constant @xmath158 , i.e. a small distance between neighboring sites , because many fast decaying evanescent modes have to be taken into account . as a consequence we would have to use large systems with up to @xmath159 ( width @xmath160 length @xmath160 degrees of freedom ) lattice points , which need extraordinary amount of memory and cpu time . + to analyze the influence of disorder let us here vary the sample structure and the parameters , similarly as it was performed for pbc in ref .  .",
    "first we decrease the width of the sample to @xmath161 . for pbc",
    "this reduction should not change the position of the maximum .",
    "however , for hbc the overlap of the edge state wave functions influences the signal in narrow wires drastically . the overlap can be reduced by increasing the bulk gap , i.e. the @xmath23 parameter as it was shown in ref .  .",
    ".   shows that a larger @xmath23 parameter leads to a smaller @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , in the following by increasing @xmath23 by the factor of 10 to @xmath162 , we expect the maximum around @xmath163 instead of @xmath151 . indeed fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] shows the conductance maximum at about @xmath164 .",
    "first we compare the tight - binding ( tb ) calculations in the absence of disorder ( red / gray dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : disorder ] ) with the signal computed in the wave matching ( wm ) formalism ( red / gray solid line ) .",
    "the signals of the two models almost coincide when we choose @xmath165 grid points .",
    "the number of points in @xmath26-direction varies with @xmath77 , since we fix the lattice constant to @xmath166 .",
    "therefore indeed the above described procedure does not change the results quantitatively but shifts the position of the conductance maximum to system sizes which can be easily calculated within tight binding model .",
    "further the conductance for pbc ( red / gray dotted line ) coincide with the signal from tight - binding calculations indicating that the overlap between the edge states is small .",
    "+    , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the disorder strength was set to @xmath169 for the black lines .",
    "the inset shows the influence of the fermi energy @xmath105 inside the sample region . ]",
    "scalar disorder is included by choosing randomly @xmath170 ( @xmath171 $ ] ) lattice sites .",
    "for our analysis here we fixed @xmath172 . on each of the selected points we shift the energy randomly by @xmath173 $ ] .",
    "the strongest disorder we can put without coupling the valence to the conduction band therefore is @xmath174 .",
    "the disorder is modeled by a gaussian - like function with the decay length @xmath175 given in units of the lattice constant @xmath158 .",
    "all signals including finite disorder have been averaged over 100 different disorder realization .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] we focus on the constant disorder strength @xmath176 varying the decaying length of the gaussian disorder from @xmath177 ( solid black line ) to @xmath178 ( dotted black line ) . for long sample lengths @xmath77 ,",
    "the disorder has no influence on the quantized conductance of the edge states , because the scalar disorder can not couple the counter propagating edge channels .",
    "when evanescent waves contribute to the transport at smaller @xmath77 the disorder has a visible influence on the signal .",
    "the influence of the disorder increases with an increase of disorder decay length .",
    "it influences the signal by shifting and increasing the maximum of conductance . to understand this effect we need to remember that the transport for short qshi lengths is dominated by evanescent modes . in this regime",
    "the extension of impurities can be comparable with the sample length introducing large fluctuations of energies over a relatively large part of the sample which can cause a shift of the conductance maximum . indeed the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] shows the conductance signal shift to left or right depending on the fermi energy inside the qshi . despite these small changes in the conductance behavior ,",
    "the conductance signal is robust against disorder for hbc .",
    "we analyzed the interplay of edge and bulk states in metal / quantum spin - hall insulator ( qshi)/metal junctions as a function of the size of qshi part as well as the fermi energy .",
    "we found that for short and wide qshi part , the edge states are not populated due to conductance mismatch between highly doped leads and qshi regime , and the transport occurs through the evanescent modes . in this regime",
    ", the topologically non - trivial insulator can be distinguished from the trivial insulator by the appearance of the distinct conductance maximum at small qshi length and the conductance peak in the gap when the fermi energy changes for the constant length .",
    "moreover , we showed that the origin of this conductance maximum is surprisingly the formation of an effectively propagating state with the real @xmath32 vector built from evanescent modes .",
    "in contrast , in the wide and long samples the transport is driven by spin edge channels while in the intermediate size regime the conductance signal is built from both bulk and edge states in the ratio which depends on the width of the sample . in this latter regime",
    "the combination of the fabry - perot oscillations ( coming from the overlap of edge states ) and bulk modes changes the position and the shape of the maximum .",
    "our predictions are robust against scalar disorder .",
    "therefore the measurements of systems with diferent geometrical aspect ratios should allow to distinguish the bulk and edge state contributions to the transport .",
    "further the detection of the bulk conductance peak as a function of fermi energy or the length for short and wide qshi junctions , should be an alternative method to distinguish between topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators in hgte qws as well as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films .",
