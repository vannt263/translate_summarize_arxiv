    ", we analyze the influence of the fundamental @xmath84 on the growth of its harmonic @xmath160 .",
    "the equation of motion for the cosine mode @xmath160 is @xmath161 where @xmath162.\\ ] ] note that the driving force term @xmath163 vanishes in the newtonian limit @xmath34 .",
    "this agrees with the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for newtonian rectangular flow .",
    "notice further , that for the non - newtonian case ( @xmath164 ) the harmonic mode @xmath160 grows spontaneously even if missing from the initial conditions .",
    "the selected sign of @xmath165 is given by the sign of @xmath163 and thus is dictated by @xmath38 : if @xmath110 ( @xmath166 ) , @xmath163 is positive ( negative ) , and hence @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "considering the case @xmath110 , this means that the fingers become narrower as the shear thinning behavior becomes more pronounced .",
    "moreover , by inspecting eq .",
    "( [ t_2k_k_rl ] ) we observe that the width of the finger tips decreases for increasingly larger values of the flow velocity @xmath154 .",
    "of course , these effects are minimized for larger values of the surface tension parameter @xmath134 .",
    "all these results are in agreement with recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical investigations  @xcite for weak shear - thinning flows in rectangular geometry , in which shear - thinning narrows the width of steady state fingers .",
    "if we take @xmath169 as the fastest growing mode , then @xmath170 so exponential growth of @xmath165 is prevented .",
    "unlike the case of radial flow where any mode @xmath10 eventually goes unstable for sufficiently large @xmath127 , the growth rates @xmath171 in the rectangular geometry are time independent . instead of exponential growth of @xmath165 , we instead expect its amplitude to saturate at the value @xmath172 obtained by setting @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ 2_harm_rl ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one could specially prepare an initial condition with an initial perturbation of wavevector @xmath84 sufficiently small that @xmath160 still lies within the band of unstable modes ( up to about @xmath174 ) , in which case mode @xmath160 will be spontaneously generated and able to grow to a considerable magnitude .    for completeness , we also discuss the shear thickening case : for @xmath111 the function @xmath163 is negative , favoring finger tip - widening . even though this shear thickening behavior has not been studied experimentally , the broadening of the fingers in shear thickening flow in rectangular cells has been theoretically predicted by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "our analytical results reinforce the correctness of such numerical predictions .    finally , we briefly discuss side branching behavior in rectangular hele - shaw cells .",
    "we consider the influence of modes @xmath84 and @xmath160 on the evolution of mode @xmath175 . in this case , the relevant equation of motion has the form @xmath176 where , as it was in the radial flow case , the coefficient @xmath177 is the sum of @xmath178 and @xmath179 @xmath180.\\ ] ] the favored sign of @xmath181 depends on the sign of the product @xmath182 and also on the sign of @xmath177 .",
    "if @xmath38 is positive ( shear thinning ) then @xmath177 is negative in the band of wavevectors @xmath183 and positive outside this band . as we saw previously in the case of mode @xmath160 , if the fundamental mode is taken as the fastest growing mode @xmath184 , then exponential growth of the harmonic @xmath175 is inhibited because @xmath185 .",
    "instead it will saturate at a magnitude of @xmath186 .    however , for a specially prepared initial condition perturbed at wavevector @xmath187 , the harmonics @xmath160 and @xmath175 will both be able to grow . by eq .",
    "( [ 2_harm_rl ] ) a positive harmonic mode @xmath167 will appear spontaneously .",
    "then , by eq .  ( [ 3_harm_rl ] ) , modes @xmath188 and @xmath165 will conspire to create mode @xmath181 . because @xmath187 lies _ outside _ the wavevector band  ( [ k - band ] ) , the value of @xmath177 is _",
    "positive_. hence the mode @xmath181 is driven positive , the sign needed to create side branches .",
    "while this conclusion is only tentative ( due to our neglect of the complete set of third order terms ) it would be interesting to test via numerical simulation or experiment .",
    "visually striking patterns arise when a less viscous newtonian fluid displaces a more viscous non - newtonian fluid in the confined geometry of a hele - shaw cell .",
    "these complex patterned structures are the result of finger tip - splitting and dendritic interfacial instabilities . due to the complicated dynamics of the system , and also from the limitations imposed by purely linear analysis , the majority of the theoretical studies in this area of research rely heavily on sophisticated numerical methods . in this work",
    ", we developed an alternative theoretical approach to the problem which allowed us to address important nonlinear issues analytically .",
    "a key point in our derivation was the introduction of velocity vector potential ( as opposed to scalar potential ) which was demanded by the non - newtonian fluid flow .",
    "we started our investigation by analyzing the role of fluid viscosity anisotropy on the development of the saffman - taylor instability in radial hele - shaw cells . to approach the problem analytically we considered the weak shear limit , and focused on the onset of nonlinear effects . in order to examine the influence of shear thinning and shear thickening on the shape of the emerging patterns , we derived a mode - coupling equation which is ideally suited to describe the weakly nonlinear interface evolution .",
    "our analytical results show that finger tip - splitting is enhanced ( diminished ) in the case of shear thickening ( thinning ) fluids .",
    "we applied the rectangular geometry limit to our radial mode - coupling equations of motion , and also studied finger - tip and side branching behavior in rectangular cells .",
    "our main findings predict finger tip - widening ( narrowing ) for shear thickening ( thinning ) fluids .    in neither the radial nor the rectangular geometry limit",
    "were we able to show the spontaneous appearance of side branching , except for some specially prepared initial conditions in rectangular geometry .",
    "we speculate that extending the current approach to third order could shed more light on this problem .    in summary ,",
    "our analytical mode - coupling approach detects and predicts several features of the patterns formed in non - newtonian hele - shaw flows in both radial and rectangular geometries .",
    "furthermore , it predicts some behaviors not yet investigated in the literature , such as the evolution mechanisms involving tendency towards advanced finger tip - splitting and reduction of side branching for shear thickening fluids .",
    "we hope the main results presented in this paper will prompt further theoretical and experimental work on non - newtonian hele - shaw flows , especially in the area of early stage transients in rectangular geometry where our theory makes specific predictions that have not been subject to experimental or numerical check .",
