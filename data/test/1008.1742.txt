    "<S> the mass density of dust particles that form from asteroids and comets in the interplanetary medium of the solar system is , near 1au , comparable to the mass density of the solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> it is mainly contained in particles of micrometer size and larger . </S>",
    "<S> dust and larger objects are destroyed by collisions and sublimation and hence feed heavy ions into the solar wind and the solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> small dust particles are present in large number and as a result of their large charge to mass ratio deflected by electromagnetic forces in the solar wind . for nano dust particles of sizes @xmath0 nm , recent calculations show trapping near the sun and outside from about 0.15 au ejection with velocities close to solar wind velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes of ejected nano dust are detected near 1au with the plasma wave instrument onboard the stereo spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> though such electric signals have been observed during dust impacts before , the interpretation depends on several different parameters and data analysis is still in progress . </S>"
