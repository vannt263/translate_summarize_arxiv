    "we then show how a gas of such coupled @xmath3 particles may naturally lead to a negative equation of state , and possibly @xmath5 .    in the remainder of the paper , secs .",
    "[ early ] to  [ cluster ] , we discuss realistic cosmological scenarios in which particle dark energy can explain the late - time acceleration .",
    "we first consider the dynamics of a fermion field , @xmath3 , coupled to a constant vector @xmath4 with dimensions of mass , a case that has been considered in flat spacetime by ref .",
    "we take the lagrangian to be @xmath6here @xmath3 is a fermion of mass @xmath7 ( assumed to be small ) , and the operator @xmath8 represents the covariant derivative acting on the spinor .",

    "however , it is possible to arrive at such a lagrangian as a low - energy approximation to a theory that develops a non - zero , vector - valued vacuum expectation value .",
    "this is a `` spontaneous '' breaking of local lorentz invariance , analogous to the way in which the higgs field spontaneously breaks the internal symmetry @xmath30 .",
    "early in the universe , at high temperatures , we expect both symmetries , lorentz and @xmath30 , to be restored .    to break lorentz invariance spontaneously , one might imagine , for example , that @xmath4 is a vector field with a standard kinetic term , the above coupling to the field @xmath3 , and a ( gauge - violating ) mexican hat potential @xmath31 .",

    "our parameter @xmath21 is then @xmath42 .",
    "as we shall see , a negative pressure will arise in this system even in the absence of a vacuum energy . in order to demonstrate this explicitly",

    "instead , the negative pressure arises in the gas of particles itself .",
    "one way to see this is as the conservation of spatial momentum requiring that the @xmath3 particles redshift , combined with the fact that for @xmath56 , the energy per particle increases with decreasing @xmath51 .",
    "the requirement that the @xmath3 particles redshift can be found by requiring that @xmath57 [ eq .  [ t ] ] be conserved .",
    "the group velocity , @xmath58 is @xmath59 and for positive helicity particles , when @xmath51 is less than @xmath21 , @xmath58 and the spatial momentum , @xmath19 , point in opposite directions .",
    "thus another , intuitive way to understand the emergence of negative pressure is to note that a particle leaving a volume in one direction carries carries with it a momentum pointed in the opposite direction .    a somewhat analogous situation to",
    "the one in this paper can arise in mhd systems , where a magnetosonic wave can develop a negative pressure  @xcite .",
    "note that the behavior of the group velocity in our model is qualitatively different from what happens near an absorbtion resonance  @xcite .",
    "our discovery of a negative @xmath54 is related to a previous result that found a changing , though not a negative , @xmath54 from an analysis of the dispersion relation for a gas of particles in a cosmological scenario involving lorentz violation  @xcite .",
    "our model , relying as it does on a particular mechanism for spontaneous lorentz violation , is relevant , though not identical , to a wide class of mechanisms developed by numerous other authors .",
    "for example ,  @xcite examined a lorentz - violating system where the vector , @xmath60 , was a fundamental field of fixed norm and not , as in our case , the spatial gradient of a scalar field .",
    "in that situation , important cosmological bounds exist from the coupling of @xmath60 to gravity ; in particular , the possibility of an effectively changing newton s constant @xmath61 arises ; see , _",

    "it may be checked that if the @xmath3 particles are subdominant to cold dark matter at small scale factors , when they have @xmath72 , they are always subdominant . thus there is no way to produce a significant period of matter domination before the onset of a negative equation of state .",
    "early decoupling , then , is not a promising model for the late - time acceleration , although it may have some applicability in the early universe .",
    "we now consider the case opposite to early decoupling .",
    "we assume that , due to a significant self - interaction term , the @xmath3 particles decouple only after they become non - relativistic .",
    "we approximate this situation by assuming that before the interval between interactions is equal to @xmath73 , the particles remain in exact thermal equilibrium , at a temperature @xmath74 corresponding to the energy density of particles .",
    "when the interaction rate is equal to @xmath73 , we assume that the particles gradually drop out of equilibrium over a finite range of scale factor .",
    "we find that before decoupling the positive helicity particles form a narrowing clump in the `` well '' of the dispersion relation at @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the population of negative helicity particles is strongly suppressed .",

    "this is the same as the early decoupling case , since relativistic particles maintain a thermal profile even after decoupling .",
    "this distribution is nearly indistinguishable from that of photons in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature .",
    "the second snapshot is before decoupling but after the universe has cooled further ; here @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the evolution has diverged from the early decoupling case , and the particle distribution forms a narrowing clump at the bottom of the well .",
    "the third snapshot is after the system has decoupled .",
    "the distribution has redshifted towards @xmath84 , and now @xmath2 .",
    "we take decoupling to happen over a finite range of scale factors : different particles leave the bottom of the well at slightly different times , so the distribution is slightly wider than just before decoupling .",
    "we can thus have an arbitrarily long period of matter domination between the radiation and dark energy dominated eras .",
    "as before , the dark energy era lasts only a brief period of time , and now appears soon after the interaction time becomes of order @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to the early decoupling case above , however , a previously subdominant @xmath3-fluid component can grow to become the dominant contribution to the stress - energy .",
    "let us now consider the plausibility of a late decoupling around @xmath85 , to explain the contemporary acceleration .",
    "we require that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number density of particles , of order @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the cross section , which we take equal to @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the average particle speed .",
    "it remains to determine @xmath91 .",
    "to a first approximation , we can take @xmath91 approximately equal to @xmath92 at all times .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , because if a particle is kicked into a state @xmath93 , its group velocity is very small .",
    "the particle may drop out of equilibrium and start to redshift .",
    "however , the unusual nature of the group velocity implies that a redshifting particle at @xmath75 finds its velocity increasing .",
    "the steepness of the group velocity curve around this point means that a particle need only redshift by a factor of @xmath94 in order for its velocity to rise from zero to @xmath95 .",

    "this is just as in the first decaying dark matter models  @xcite .",
    "d@xmath110cdm , of course , actually is a model with decay : there dark matter turns into ultra - relativistic particles that then develop a negative equation of state .",
    "we have discussed the phenomenon of lorentz - violating couplings in the context of an frw curved spacetime , and have demonstrated how a fermion coupled to a spontaneous lorentz - violating condensate can produce a strongly negative equation of state .",
    "we have also presented two models , one requiring a late - time decoupling ( `` @xmath110cdm '' ) , and the other requiring a late - time decay ( `` d@xmath110cdm '' ) , that , at least in outline form , can explain the contemporary acceleration . in particular",

    "the rich set of behaviors , and the number of scenarios that can be constructed even from such a toy model as eq .",
    "[ lag2 ] suggests that the question of using different lorentz breaking mechanisms , such as a non - zero expectation value for a vector or tensor field , deserves further investigation .",
    "there are also a wide range of possible couplings between such a lorentz - violating expectation value and various kinds of matter , including not only fermion couplings , but also derivative couplings to scalar field particles , and direct couplings to particles of higher spin .",
    "a catalogue of lorentz violating couplings to the standard model has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here , since we are coupling to the dark sector , we may use much larger couplings without violating lorentz - violation bounds from atomic or accelerator physics",
    ". a first indicator of whether or not a system will generate a negative equation of state in any model of interest will be a turn - over in the particle s group velocity , eq .",

    "lorentz violation has long been a subject of study in the particle and atomic physics community ; we are only just beginning to discover its cosmological implications  @xcite .",
    "many recent astrophysical studies have focused on high energy signatures , such as the gzk cutoff  @xcite , and in the context of loop quantum gravity or non - commutative geometry  @xcite . here ,",
    "in contrast , we have demonstrated how lorentz - violating couplings can lead to negative pressures in the context of a spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance , and we have shown how such violation may have astrophysical implications at low energies .    spontaneous lorentz violation has long been considered as a feature of string theory for the bosonic string and the superstring  @xcite . it may also be a generic aspect of braneworld models , where lorentz violation occurs in the bulk and may be seen on the brane as well  @xcite .",
    "finally , the role of the universal time - like vector could even be played by the same mechanism underlying the thermodynamic `` arrow of time . ''    because of the generic nature of our discussion , we expect the essence of our conclusions to hold true for these more elaborate scenarios when a time - like lorentz - violating condensate couples to the dark sector . as this paper has shown , there is a rich set of phenomena to be discovered that may potentially resolve long - standing theoretical and observational questions . +",
