    "it is well established that the astrophysical origin of the majority of nuclides beyond fe requires at least two neutron - capture processes , the @xmath2 process and the @xmath3 process @xcite .",
    "the abundances of a comparatively small number of nuclides , however , can not be explained by those processes . while older literature counted 35 nuclides , called the @xmath0 nuclei",
    ", being problematic in the context of neutron - capture processes , more recent work also suggests strong s - process contributions to @xmath4er , @xmath5gd , and @xmath6ta @xcite , and combined s- and r - process contributions to @xmath7 in and @xmath8sn @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath9la is produced by neutrino - induced reactions in core - collapse supernova explosions of massive stars and also @xmath6ta may have some neutrino - induced contributions @xcite .",
    "this leaves the origin of 30 proton - rich isotopes to be explained",
    ".    for detailed explanations of the @xmath0 nuclides and their possible production in various astrophysical sites , see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite and references therein . here , only a brief account of the most important facts is provided , as relevant to establish the context of our present study .",
    "solar system @xmath0 abundances have been derived from geological and meteoritic data .",
    "understanding the origin of the @xmath0 nuclides is challenging because they can not be directly observed in stars and supernova remnants , as their contribution to elemental abundances is small and no element is dominated by a @xmath0 isotope . therefore , possible nucleosynthesis processes have to be studied in models without the possibility of direct verification .",
    "additionally , terrestrial and meteoritic @xmath0 abundances have to be derived from galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models , integrating the production of different sites over the history of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the solar composition may not follow the average galactic composition , which is calculated in gce models .",
    "model uncertainties are introduced in each simulation step but the initial uncertainties are due to the astrophysical reaction rates used in the nuclear reaction networks .",
    "it is the aim of the current work to quantify the contribution of nuclear uncertainties to the production uncertainties of selected models .",
    "it is useful for nucleosynthesis studies to directly see the uncertainties in the abundances of modeled nucleosynthesis processes , as they will guide theoretical and experimental nuclear scientists in improving the knowledge of selected rates , and they can also be included and propagated in gce models . in order to obtain a quantification of final abundance uncertainties ,",
    "we apply a monte carlo method of varying rates according to their nuclear uncertainties .",
    "the method can be generally applied to any nucleosynthesis environment which is studied with reaction networks and also allows identification of key rates in a self - consistent and automatic manner . here , we apply it to the synthesis of @xmath0 nuclei but will also study further processes in subsequent papers .    as for the @xmath0 nuclei",
    ", it was suggested that they can be produced by photodisintegration reactions of pre - existing seed nuclei in the outer shells of exploding massive stars @xcite .",
    "although this @xmath10 process occurs naturally in stellar explosions and thus is able to produce the bulk of @xmath0 nuclides within a single site , there are longstanding problems in obtaining @xmath0 abundances consistent with solar system amounts for at least two @xmath0-nucleus mass ranges : light ones with mass number @xmath11 , heavier ones , in the mass range @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these deficiencies in @xmath0-nucleus production have triggered a large number of investigations in astrophysics and nuclear physics , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the underproduction in the heavier mass range may be cured by improved nuclear physics input whereas a different astrophysical site may be required for the light @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "a promising alternative site is the explosion of a mass - accreting white dwarf in a thermonuclear supernova @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the full range of @xmath0 nuclei could be produced in such an explosion but a strong production of @xmath2-process seeds in the accreting matter is required @xcite .",
    "currently , there are no self - consistent simulations of the accretion , @xmath2-process enhancement , and explosion , but rather a high level of @xmath2-process seeds has to be assumed .    in this work",
    ", we focus on the @xmath10 process in massive stars , which depends on the assumed initial abundances and the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "it is also influenced by the modeled stellar evolution and explosion , and thus depends on the stellar model code . to explore both of these dependences , we perform production uncertainty analyses in two different basic stellar models and for two progenitor masses .",
    "a similar analysis of the synthesis of @xmath0-nuclei in a 2d thermonuclear white dwarf explosion currently is in progress and will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in addition to the stable @xmath0 nuclides , the @xmath10 process also produces unstable isotopes with relatively long half - life ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these are important insofar as a number of now extinct radiogenic nuclides were present in the early solar system .",
    "in particular , signatures of the presence of @xmath13nb , @xmath14tc , and @xmath15sm have been found , detected as excess of their stable daughter isotopes .",
    "for a detailed account of these measurements and their implication for galactic chemical evolution , see , e.g. , chapter 4 of @xcite .",
    "because of their importance , we also study the production of @xmath13nb , @xmath15sm and @xmath14tc in our models and provide the resulting production uncertainties in section [ sec : radio ] .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) method of using random number input to numerical simulations has a long history in science and engineering .",
    "it has been used relatively seldomly in astrophysical investigations due to the demand on computation time per run in hydrodynamical simulations ( for application to nuclear astrophysics , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the advent of fast computers and the use of postprocessing techniques",
    "it has become feasible , though , to perform a statistically sufficient number of mc iterations even with reaction networks containing several thousand nuclei .    here , we employ a straightforward application of the mc method by drawing sets of random numbers to simultaneously vary reaction rates within predefined uncertainty limits .",
    "this is described in detail in sections [ sec : pizbuin ] and [ sec : uncert ] . in this way",
    ", the initial nuclear uncertainties are mapped onto uncertainties in the final abundances via the reaction network .",
    "using such a mc approach allows the final uncertainties to be quantified , even when many individual reactions contribute to the abundance of a given nucleus .",
    "while the inspection of reaction flows in flow plots may be sufficient when only few reactions contribute within the range of a well - defined reaction path , the effect of complex flow patterns  such as those arising in the high - temperature environments of explosive nucleosynthesis  and the _ combined _ action of uncertainties can only be addressed using a mc method .",
    "the technique also makes possible the identification of those reactions that give rise to the largest uncertainties in individual isotope final abundances , as is presented in section [ sec : correlations ] .",
    "our mc framework pizbuin consists of an efficient reaction network code and a parallelized mc driver providing random number input with the possibility to choose the number of varied rates and the random distributions to draw from .",
    "another feature is the possibility to define temperature - dependent uncertainty factors for each rate individually .",
    "this is further explained in section [ sec : varfacts ] .",
    "tools to analyze the mc output complement the code suite .",
    "a nuclear reaction network is a stiff set of coupled differential equations describing the temporal change @xmath16 in the abundance of a given nucleus @xmath17 .",
    "the network includes all reactions affecting the abundance of a nucleus @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is avogadro s number , @xmath20 numbers the nucleus , @xmath21 is the stellar @xmath22th rate for destruction or creation of the @xmath17th nucleus without a nuclear projectile involved ( this includes spontaneous decay , lepton capture , photodisintegration ) , and @xmath23 is the stellar rate of the @xmath22th reaction involving a nuclear projectile and creating or destroying nucleus @xmath17 . the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive or negative integer numbers specifying the number of nuclei @xmath17 produced or destroyed , respectively , in the given process .",
    "similarly , three - body reactions can be included but they are not shown here because they were not varied . as shown below , the stellar rates @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain the abundances of the interacting nuclei and depend on the plasma temperature @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the abundance change depends on the density @xmath29 of the plasma .",
    "a postprocessing trajectory defines @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a function of time and thus the above reaction network has to be solved in each timestep when following the evolution of abundances through a nucleosynthesis process .",
    "this implies that an @xmath30 matrix has to be inverted in each timestep .",
    "the stiffness of the set of differential equations requires small timesteps .",
    "the inversion , however , can be made more efficient due to the fact that this is a highly sparse matrix and sophisticated mathematical techniques can be applied .",
    "the two - body rate @xmath31 for a reaction @xmath32 between a projectile @xmath33 and the nucleus @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the reactivity , i.e. , the stellar cross section ( including reactions on thermally populated excited states in @xmath34 ) folded with the velocity distribution of the interacting particles .",
    "rates of two - body reactions including only leptons and photodisintegrations can be expressed similarly to decays in a rate @xmath37 . for simple decays , @xmath38 is related to the ( stellar ) half - life .",
    "it has to be noted that @xmath39 depends on the plasma temperature and thus @xmath40 is not always just a constant . for photodisintegrations ,",
    "@xmath41 is derived from integrating the stellar photodisintegration cross section ( including the effect of thermally populated excited states ) over a planck distribution .",
    "alternatively , it can be derived from the capture rate as shown below in equation ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) .",
    "rates for reactions with leptons ( for example , electron captures ) can also be written in this form , with @xmath42 depending on temperature and electron abundance @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to remember that forward and reverse rates are connected by the reciprocity relation for nuclear reactions , also called detailed balance .",
    "while for weak interactions the inverse processes are not relevant in the current context , temperatures are sufficiently high to allow competition between captures and photodisintegrations as well as between forward and reverse channels of other reactions .",
    "the existence of a reciprocity relation for stellar rates is also important when applying multiplicative variation factors because both reaction directions have to be changed by the same factor .",
    "this can easily be seen when writing the reverse reactivity ( for the reaction @xmath44 ) in terms of the forward reactivity of the reaction @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the reaction @xmath48-value of the forward reaction @xcite .",
    "similarly , photodisintegration @xmath49 is related to capture @xmath50 through @xmath51 these equations make use of the spin factors @xmath52 of projectile and ejectile , respectively , and of the partition functions @xmath53 of the participating nuclei , also depending on the plasma temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the nuclear partition function @xmath53 is defined , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the reduced mass of projectile and target nucleus is denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the above relations only apply to stellar reactivities , not to those derived from cross sections only including ground states of target nuclei .",
    "thus , they do not apply to reactivities derived from experimental cross sections , unless reactions on excited states do not contribute .",
    "a criterion for this will be discussed and used in section [ sec : uncert ] .    from equations ( [ eq : revrate ] ) and ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) it is directly seen that multiplying the stellar reactivity @xmath36 by a given factor will also increase the reactivity of the reverse reaction by the same factor .",
    "therefore the variation factors derived from the output of the mc driver ( see section [ sec : varfacts ] ) are applied to both reaction directions in each mc iteration and the final abundances calculated by following the trajectories in the reaction network with modified rates .",
    "the mc driver passes a vector @xmath56 to the network code .",
    "this vector contains @xmath57 random numbers between 0 and 1 for the variation of the chosen @xmath57 rates to be varied ( out of the @xmath58 reactions ) .",
    "the random values are drawn from preset random distributions .",
    "it is possible to choose a different distribution ( uniform , normal , lognormal ,  ) for each rate .",
    "when calculating a reaction rate for a trajectory timestep , the network code then maps the random numbers to a variation factor for each rate .",
    "again , the mapping can be different for each rate , depending on preselected choices but also on plasma temperature .",
    "details are given in section [ sec : varfacts ] .",
    "each mc iteration consists of running all available trajectories ( see section [ sec : stellarmodels ] ) . at the end of each trajectory",
    "run , the final abundances of selected nuclei are recorded . for the present application to the @xmath10 process ,",
    "these are the ones of the @xmath0 nuclei and of a few long - lived radioactivities .",
    "the combined final abundance data are finally analyzed to find the abundance variations , and thus the production uncertainties based on nuclear uncertainties , caused by the variation of the reaction rates .",
    "these are the results presented in section [ sec : finalabuns ] . a correlation analysis of the data",
    "is also used to identify key rates , as explained in section [ sec : correlations ] , with the results shown in section [ sec : key ] .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the required computational time is largely independent of the number of varied reaction rates .",
    "rather , it is determined by the time taken to follow the reaction network through a given trajectory , the number of trajectories , and the number of mc iterations required to obtain statistical significance .",
    "the solution time for the network is determined by the network size , i.e. , the number @xmath59 of nuclei considered and the number @xmath58 of reactions connecting them .",
    "each mc iteration initially sets up the vector @xmath56 for the variation and then runs the trajectory .",
    "that means that in each run all @xmath57 rates are varied .",
    "choosing a sufficiently large number of iterations ensures that the space of possible combinations is largely sampled with a comparatively small number of variations . using test calculations we confirmed that 10000 variations , i.e. , mc iterations , are sufficient .",
    "this also means that each rate is varied 10000 times . with a given reaction network and trajectory , this requires always the same time , regardless of the size of @xmath57 .",
    "it is not straightforward to define the uncertainties inherent in model calculations .",
    "this goes even beyond the distinction between statistical and systematic errors as used , e.g. , in assigning error bars to measurements .",
    "this has been discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "two main sources of errors can be identified , the model itself and its input .",
    "whenever input is derived from experimental data it will carry their statistical and systematic errors , which will be propagated through the model and into the final results . the error introduced by the choice of model , on the other hand ,",
    "is difficult to quantify as the associated error is not statistical .",
    "rather , the underlying assumptions have to be examined and an estimation has to be made about the inherent uncertainty .",
    "this estimate can be checked , to a certain extent , by comparison of the final results to further data but in principle it is impossible to ascertain the validity of a model completely @xcite .",
    "the case is complicated by the fact that some of the input may not be measured properties but will also come from a theoretical treatment within further models .    the usual approach for obtaining model uncertainties is to ignore possible errors in the main model and focus on the error propagation of input uncertainties . in this work ,",
    "we follow a similar strategy , propagating uncertainties in the nuclear input , i.e. , in the astrophysical reaction rates , through a given postprocessing model . additionally , however , we compare the results from two different stellar evolution and explosion treatments .",
    "this also provides clues on the underlying model uncertainties .    concerning uncertainties in stellar reaction rates , it is unavoidable to again combine experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that cross sections of many of the reactions involved in the @xmath10 process have not been measured , because either the target nuclei are radioactive or the coulomb barrier prevents an experimental determination at the relevant , low energies . even if a reaction cross section is measured , however , it still may have to be supplemented by predictions in order to arrive at a _ stellar _ cross section @xmath60 and thus a _ stellar _",
    "reactivity @xmath61 as required in equations ( [ eq : network])([eq : revphoto ] ) .",
    "current laboratory measurements of reaction cross sections can only address target nuclei in their ground state and thus reactions proceeding on their excited states have to be treated in a reaction model .",
    "( this is not to say that experimental information on certain transitions leading to excited states or to test a reaction model can not be extracted but theory has to be invoked to cast these data into an astrophysical reaction rate . )",
    "excited state contributions to the stellar rate depend on the plasma temperature and the spectroscopic properties of the involved nuclei .",
    "in general , a higher intrinsic nuclear level density in a nucleus will lead to a higher importance of excited state contributions but the presence of low - lying excited states , a few tens of kev above the ground state , may render them important even in nuclei with otherwise low level density .",
    "while for light nuclei with their large level spacings and high particle separation energies , excited state contributions are sizeable only for a limited number of cases , the inclusion of reactions on thermally populated target states has been shown to be important in all nucleosynthesis environments for the production of nuclei beyond fe @xcite .",
    "the total contribution @xmath62 of reactions on thermally excited states of a nucleus can be quantified as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the ground state ( g.s . )",
    "contribution @xcite @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the reaction cross section for the target nucleus in the g.s .",
    "( this is the usual laboratory cross section ) and @xmath67 is its g.s .",
    "it is very important to note that this definition of the g.s .",
    "contribution is different from the simple ratio of g.s .  and stellar rates , respectively . exhaustive tables of g.s",
    ".  contributions are found in @xcite .",
    "an important application of g.s .",
    "contributions is the determination of rate uncertainties .",
    "laboratory measurements of reaction cross sections only constrain @xmath66 and the contributions of excited states to the stellar rate have to be determined from theory . depending on @xmath64 ,",
    "the measured cross section will contribute more or less to the stellar rate .",
    "likewise , the uncertainty in the stellar rate will be more or less dominated by the experimental error .",
    "@xcite has shown that for a number of intermediate and heavy nuclei , @xmath64 is small already at @xmath2 process temperatures . in explosive conditions , such as for the @xmath10 process with typical temperatures between 2 and 3.5 gk , @xmath64 will be small for most nuclei .",
    "therefore it is necessary to construct an uncertainty that varies with temperature , according to the varying contributions of g.s .  and excited states .",
    "following @xcite , an experimental uncertainty factor @xmath68 for the reaction cross section of a target nucleus in the g.s .  and a theoretical one @xmath69 for the prediction of reactions with the target nucleus",
    "being excited can be combined to a total uncertainty @xmath70 of the stellar rate , with @xmath71 assuming @xmath72 .",
    "when there is no measurement , obviously the above equation trivially reduces to just the theory uncertainty .    as discussed in @xcite , the predicted g.s .",
    "contributions themselves carry an uncertainty and it would be possible to include it in the above equation .",
    "as was also shown , however , it is small and does not affect the main impact , i.e. , within their errors small contributions remain small , large ones remain large and the overall uncertainty @xmath70 is not largely changed .",
    "therefore , we have ignored the uncertainty in @xmath64 when constructing our temperature - dependent uncertainties .",
    "the pizbuin mc framework offers several ways of treating uncertainties .",
    "the possibility of using temperature - dependent errors has already been mentioned above .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties can be asymmetric around a given `` standard '' rate and the upper and lower envelopes can be set independently to any desired function of temperature .",
    "random values can be drawn from three possible distributions : the uniform distribution , gaussian distribution , and lognormal distribution .",
    "an individual uncertainty can be chosen for each rate although in practice it will often be the case that certain types of rates are assigned similar uncertainties in a region of nuclides .",
    "when setting up the mc runs , uncertainties have to be chosen and the trajectories provided for the network calculation . during the actual runs , in each mc iteration a set of variation factors @xmath56 for the @xmath57 rates to be varied is randomly generated according to the preset variation type .",
    "a trajectory is processed with the factors applied to the rates ( and applying the same factor to forward and reverse rate as explained in section [ sec : errdefs ] ) and the resulting abundances are stored .",
    "then a new iteration is started with a newly chosen set of variation factors .    in a gaussian distribution , the function values @xmath73",
    "are normally distributed , while in a lognormal distribution @xmath74 are normally distributed . while historically the gaussian distribution has been mostly used in statistical error analysis , recently the lognormal distribution is viewed as being a more appropriate choice for natural processes , especially when many unknown factors are acting together @xcite .",
    "where gaussian distributions are added and therefore account for addition of contributing terms , lognormal distributions are multiplied and stem from multiplication of contributing factors . nowadays , the lognormal distribution is used in many different fields , from biology to finance @xcite . for experimental errors and variation of rates and cross sections , it has the beneficial feature that it implicitly forbids the results to assume unphysical , negative values .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : finalabuns ] that abundance uncertainties assume distributions very close to lognormal distributions even when the uncertainties in the input were not lognormally distributed .",
    "this arises from the error multiplication effect when several reactions are contributing to the total uncertainty .",
    "gaussian and lognormal distributions are related but a determination of the usually used ( gaussian ) confidence intervals is complicated and non - trivial for the general case of a lognormal distribution .",
    "one approach is to extract confidence limits from the underlying normal distribution and convert them to ( asymmetric ) ones of the lognormal distribution .",
    "a straightforward approach only works if the derived confidence interval does not include zero or negative values . for a sample recipe ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    in astrophysics ,",
    "sensitivity studies usually vary rates by a certain factor smaller or larger than unity , to check how the abundance of a nuclide produced in a nucleosynthesis process depends on a rate",
    ". this would also be an appropriate way to test dependence on theoretical models , which can not be assumed to be drawn from a statistical distribution but rather exhibit only systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "such a variation can be modeled by using variation factors drawn from a uniform distribution , which generates values with equal probability between two limits . since in this first application of our mc code we want to combine experimental and theoretical errors , we also assumed such uniform distributions for experimental errors .",
    "gaussian errors on measured values were converted by taking 2@xmath75 confidence intervals to define the boundaries of the value range for the uniform distribution .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties should include realistic assumptions for the uncertainties introduced by the input for a stellar rate calculation , as well as for the systematic uncertainty by the application of specific models to treat input and cross section calculations .",
    "these were motivated by comparisons between experimental and predicted g.s .",
    "cross sections across the nuclear chart and are shown in table [ tab : defineuncert ] .",
    "for example , @xcite found an average deviation of 30% for 30 kev neutron captures along stability but also show systematic deviations of up to a factor of two in certain mass regions , especially close to magic numbers where the hauser - feshbach model reaches its limit .",
    "although this limitation is at least partially lifted at higher plasma temperatures , we nevertheless assumed a factor of two uncertainty in predicted ( n,@xmath10 ) rates .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent experiments have shown that the standard rates by @xcite systematically overestimate ( @xmath76,@xmath10 ) rates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the deviations found are between factors 1.0 and 0.1 .",
    "accordingly , we use an asymmetric error for such rates , allowing only limited variation to higher values but setting the lower bound to 0.1 of the standard rate .",
    ".theory uncertainty factors assumed for various reaction types ; for the upper limit , the rate is multiplied by @xmath77 , for the lower limit it is divided by @xmath78 . for measured g.s .",
    "cross sections , these uncertainties were combined with the experimental error to derive a temperature - dependent uncertainty factor as shown in equation ( [ eq : uncertainty ] ) .",
    "note that forward and reverse rates , e.g. , captures and photodisintegrations , are modified by the same factor . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for the first time we have performed a comprehensive , large - scale mc study of nucleosynthesis in the @xmath10 process in massive stars , varying reactions on targets from fe to bi .",
    "temperature - dependent stellar reaction rate uncertainties were individually assigned to the reactions , allowing a quantification of the uncertainties in final @xmath0-nucleus production due to nuclear input .",
    "our approach also allowed identification of a number of key rates  which contribute most to these final uncertainties  by a well - defined , automated method .",
    "overall , the uncertainties were found to be modest , better than a factor of two .",
    "the remaining uncertainties are mainly due to theoretically predicted rates of reactions on unstable nuclei and of excited state contributions .",
    "only few uncertainties could be reduced directly by measuring g.s .",
    "cross sections .",
    "these are the ones with large g.s .",
    "contributions to the stellar rate , which occur only for target nuclei in the mass range of the light @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "abundances and their uncertainties were studied in three different stellar models , two based on the same code and input but for two progenitor masses , and one for an additional , widely - used stellar model .",
    "a direct comparison revealed that the older model used too crude a mass grid to be able to follow properly the temperature evolution in the @xmath10-process layers . the coarse grid and an inner cutoff at too large a radius led to discrepancies mainly in the prediction of light @xmath0 nuclei and a number of heavier @xmath0 nuclides whose production is spread out over many zones .",
    "the results of our study are expected to be useful for both astrophysicists and nuclear physicists .",
    "they can be incorporated in galactic chemical evolution models to assess uncertainties in galactic @xmath0-nucleus production , although it would be desirable to extend this investigation to a wider range of progenitor masses and initial metallicities to fully capture the uncertainty distribution .",
    "experimental and theoretical nuclear physicists can see which reaction rates need to be improved to successfully reduce the uncertainties .",
    "this maiden voyage of our mc framework also worked as a proof of concept , showing that it is possible to perform large - scale rate variations in extended reaction networks and use the mc method to not only quantify combined uncertainties of all rates but also derive the key rates that contribute the most to those uncertainties .",
    "we plan to apply our method to further nucleosynthesis processes , such as the @xmath10-process in thermonuclear supernovae ( in preparation ) , the weak @xmath2 process in massive stars @xcite , the main @xmath2 process @xcite , and the @xmath79- , @xmath80- , and @xmath3-processes .",

    "<S> nuclear data uncertainties in the production of @xmath0 nuclei in massive stars have been quantified in a monte carlo procedure . </S>",
    "<S> bespoke temperature - dependent uncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei from fe to bi . </S>",
    "<S> their simultaneous impact was studied in postprocessing explosive trajectories for three different stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the grid of mass zones in the model of a 25 @xmath1 star , which is widely used for investigations of @xmath0 nucleosynthesis , is too crude to properly resolve the detailed temperature changes required for describing the production of @xmath0 nuclei . using models with finer grids for 15 @xmath1 and 25 @xmath1 stars with initial solar metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , it was found that most of the production uncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a factor of two . since a large number of rates </S>",
    "<S> were varied at the same time in the monte carlo procedure , possible cancellation effects of several uncertainties could be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> key rates were identified for each @xmath0 nucleus , which provide the dominant contribution to the production uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> these key rates were found by examining correlations between rate variations and resulting abundance changes . </S>",
    "<S> this method is superior to studying flow patterns , especially when the flows are complex , and to individual , sequential variation of a few rates .    </S>",
