    "for one - dimensional quantum spin chains , there are some theoretical predictions which have been confirmed experimentally .",
    "one example is the haldane conjecture@xcite .",
    "haldane investigated the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath8 model , and predicted that an excitation gap opens for integer spin chains but not for half - odd integer spin chains .",
    "this conjecture was confirmed by numerical calculations@xcite , and the haldane gap was observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "another example of such theoretical predictions is the presence of logarithmic corrections at very low temperatures for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ( s1/2ah ) .",
    "this feature was predicted by the renormalization - group approach@xcite and was confirmed numerically by bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "later , this behavior was observed experimentally@xcite . in this way , the presence of logarithmic corrections at very low temperatures for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain was established .",
    "there is another interesting prediction which has been observed experimentally quite recently@xcite .",
    "this is the so - called affleck - haldane conjecture@xcite .",
    "affleck extended haldane s argument to the bond - alternating chains , and predicted that there will be @xmath9 gapless points for the spin-@xmath10 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with bond - alternation .",
    "later , for the spin-1 case , the central charge @xmath11 at the gapless point is estimated as @xmath12 by numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "this implies that the low - lying excitations at the gapless point are described by the level @xmath13 su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model . as a result ,",
    "the same qualitative low - temperature properties as those of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain are expected at the gapless point .",
    "recent experiments for [ \\{ni(333-tet)(@xmath1-n@xmath2)}@xmath3(clo@xmath4)@xmath5 ( 333-tet = tetraamine @xmath6-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-propanediamine ) show that this compound has a structure which is effectively described by the spin-1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with bond - alternation ( s1ba)@xcite , and that the behavior of the uniform susceptibility is close to what is expected at the gapless point@xcite .",
    "thus , this compound is probably an experimental realization of the gapless point of the affleck - haldane conjecture . in order to clarify this feature in more detail ,",
    "it is necessary to show explicitly how the uniform susceptibility behaves in the low - temperature regime for s1ba at the gapless point .",
    "hence , the purpose of this paper is to clarify the range of temperatures for which the field - theoretical prediction is valid , and to what extent s1ba can explain the low - temperature properties of this compound .",
    "for the gapless point of s1ba , singh and gelfand applied a series expansion technique , and estimated the critical value of the strength of bond - alternation @xmath14 as @xmath15@xcite .",
    "later , kato and tanaka applied the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , and obtained clear evidence of the affleck - haldane conjecture@xcite .",
    "they estimated the critical value @xmath16 more accurately as @xmath17 .",
    "as for the excitation spectrum , yamamoto performed the quantum monte carlo simulation ( world - line algorithm ) , and obtained the dispersion relation@xcite .",
    "totsuka , _ et.al .",
    "_ investigated the low - lying excitation spectrum by exact diagonalization , and analyzed the results using the conformal field theory@xcite .",

    ", we have to determine the critical value of @xmath14 more accurately . in sec.[gapless ] , we estimate @xmath16 from the low - temperature behavior of the uniform susceptibility and the staggered susceptibility . in sec.[main ] , we analyze the low - temperature properties of s1ba at the gapless point based on the field - theoretical prediction .",
    "comparisons with numerical results of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain are also made . in sec.[experiment ] , the numerical results are compared with recent experimental results for [ \\{ni(333-tet)(@xmath1-n@xmath2)}@xmath3(clo@xmath4)@xmath5 .    in the present paper , we consider s1ba defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath19                      \\mbox{\\boldmath $ s_i\\cdot s_{i+1}$},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath21 with spin one ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the length of the chain and the temperature are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath25 as the energy unit .",
    "we use the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method ( loop algorithm)@xcite .",
    "the simulations have been performed in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we have typically run @xmath26 monte carlo steps for measurements after @xmath27 steps .",
    "we have made extrapolation for the trotter slice @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 using the data at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the system - sizes we have investigated are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we have performed calculations up to inverse temperature @xmath35 .",
    "first , let us look over global features of s1ba for finite temperatures .",
    "figure [ ussss0gl ] shows the uniform susceptibility @xmath36 , the staggered susceptibility @xmath37 and the staggered structure factor @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41-component of the spin at site @xmath42 in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time , and @xmath43 is the number of trotter slices defined as @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 denotes the thermal average at temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the uniform susceptibility @xmath36 in the low - temperature regime is fitted well by @xmath46 , except for @xmath47 , as shown in fig.[usglbeta ] .",
    "this behavior is expected when the dispersion relation is @xmath48@xcite , where @xmath49 is the momentum measured from the lowest triplet state and @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "thus , except for @xmath47 , the low - energy excitation may be explained by a magnon excitation with a finite excitation gap @xmath51@xcite .",
    "this excitation gap @xmath51 gradually decreases as @xmath14 approaches @xmath52 . as for the staggered susceptibility @xmath37 and the staggered structure factor @xmath38 , the maximum value becomes larger as @xmath14 approaches @xmath52 .",
    "this behavior is expected from the affleck - haldane conjecture and is consistent with various numerical results@xcite .",
    "in this section , we accurately determine the critical value @xmath16 .",
    "one criterion is based on the expectation that the uniform susceptibility @xmath36 reaches a maximum at the critical point if the temperature is low enough . in fig.[usssdelta](a ) , we show the @xmath14-dependence of the uniform susceptibility .",
    "the maximum is located near @xmath53 with little size and temperature dependence .",
    "another criterion for the critical point @xmath16 is that the staggered susceptibility @xmath37 is a maximum at the critical point at sufficiently low temperatures@xcite .",
    "we show the @xmath14-dependence of the staggered susceptibility in fig.[usssdelta](b ) . near @xmath53",
    ", @xmath37 also reaches a maximum with little size and temperature dependence .",
    "thus , we estimate the critical value of @xmath14 as @xmath0@xcite .    in order to show the validity of this estimation , we compare the low - temperature behaviors of @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath54 with those at @xmath55 and @xmath56 in fig.[ussslt ] .",
    "this figure clearly shows that @xmath54 is closer to the critical point @xmath16 than @xmath55 or @xmath57 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the low - temperature properties of s1ba at the critical point , assuming that it is described by the @xmath13 su(2 ) wzw model ( with a marginally irrelevant operator)@xcite .      before investigating the low - temperature behavior of the uniform susceptibility of s1ba at the gapless point , we briefly review the case of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ( s1/2ah ) as an example which is described by the @xmath13 su(2 ) wzw model .",
    "figure [ uss1/2ah ] shows the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility @xmath36 for s1/2ah@xcite .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the fit assuming eq.([logeq ] ) , which is expected from the renormalization group approach@xcite .",

    "one of the features due to this logarithmic correction is the infinite slope in the low - temperature limit . as a result , naive extrapolation of @xmath36 as @xmath60 , using the data in the low - temperature regime ( @xmath61 ) , does not coincide with the zero - temperature uniform susceptibility @xmath62@xcite .",
    "another feature is the existence of an inflection point in the low - temperature regime . for s1/2ah ,",
    "the inflection point is near @xmath63@xcite .",
    "let us consider the s1ba case .",
    "figure [ uss1ba ] shows the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility @xmath36 for s1ba at the critical point ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this figure supports the existence of the logarithmic correction in the sense that naive extrapolation of @xmath36 as @xmath60 does not coincide with the zero - temperature uniform susceptibility @xmath62 , and that there exists an inflection point near @xmath64 .",
    "we have tried to fit the numerical data as eq.([logeq ] ) , and estimated @xmath65 .",
    "this value of @xmath66 is smaller than that of s1/2ah by about one order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "next , we consider the low - temperature behaviors of the staggered susceptibility @xmath37 and the staggered structure factor @xmath38 . for s1/2ah , starykh @xmath67 confirmed that @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the low - temperature regime behave as follows@xcite : @xmath68^{1/2},\\label{scalingss}\\\\ s(q=\\pi;t)&\\propto&[\\ln(t_s / t)]^{3/2}.\\label{scalings0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we consider the s1ba case",
    ". figures [ sss1ba ] and [ s0s1ba ] show the temperature dependence of the staggered susceptibility @xmath37 and the staggered structure factor @xmath38 for s1ba at the gapless point in the low temperature regime .",

    "[ for comparison , in the insets of figs .",
    "[ sss1ba](b ) and [ s0s1ba](b ) , we show the s1/2ah case . ]",
    "thus , the behaviors of @xmath37 and @xmath38 also support that s1ba at the critical point belongs to the universality class of the @xmath13 su(2 ) wzw model .",
    "in this section , numerical results are compared with the experimental data for [ \\{ni(333-tet)(@xmath1-n@xmath2)}@xmath3(clo@xmath4)@xmath5@xcite .",
    "figure [ exp ] shows the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility for the powder sample of [ \\{ni(333-tet)(@xmath1-n@xmath2)}@xmath3(clo@xmath4)@xmath5 .",
    "the global feature of the experimental data is very similar to that of the numerical results for s1ba at the gapless point .",
    "this suggests that this compound is effectively described by s1ba near the critical point .",
    "a little difference in the low temperature regime may be due to small anisotropy effects or off - criticality of this compound .",
