    "most cluster matter is non - baryonic , `` dark matter '' .",
    "the baryonic matter within clusters is predominantly hot , diffuse plasma ( @xmath1 ) ; the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the icms are shocked and stirred throughout their formation @xcite .",
    "the resulting icm flow structures provide vital information about the large scale dynamics of cluster formation , as well as about the physics of the icm plasma@xcite .",
    "cluster - scale shocks , in particular , are tell - tale consequences of merger events @xcite . tracing and deciphering these icm flow structures are essential to our understanding of cluster formation .",
    "while thermal x - rays have successfully revealed some icm shocks and other flow features @xcite , distinct x - ray signatures are often subtle and hard to isolate and measure cleanly .",
    "observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect add some statistical information about the icm pressure and velocity distributions@xcite .",
    "but , a full , clear picture requires additional , complementary tools .",
    "thankfully , non - thermal synchrotron emissions from @xmath2 gev electrons ( cre ) in the icm and in embedded objects may help reach this goal .",
    "so far , the principal non - x - ray tool in efforts to characterize icm dynamics has been cluster - scale , diffuse radio emissions ( radio `` halos '' , `` mini - halos '' and `` relics '' ) by electrons within the icm that are energized or re - energized by cluster shocks and/or turbulence @xcite . there are multiple plausible origins for those diffuse cre , which in various models may be recent or ancient @xcite .",
    "their links to local , current icm dynamics result from the fact that they have rather short lifetimes against synchrotron losses and inverse compton scattering of cmb photons ( @xmath3 100 myr ) .",
    "observed cre must be `` energetically younger '' than this . since icm flow velocities are characteristically @xmath4 kpc / myr , such embedded cre must have been energized relatively close by on cluster scales .",
    "although these emissions place essential constraints on icm physics , their translation into distinct and firm icm dynamical properties has so far proven to be quite challenging @xcite .    at the same time , radio - bright , bipolar plasma outflows from active galactic nuclei ( radio agn , henceforth , simply agn ) are common in clusters @xcite .",
    "interactions between those outflows and icm dynamical structures on scales of 10s to 100s of kpc offer an additional and potentially very useful diagnostic probe of the icm dynamics and physics .",
    "that is quite separate from the increasing evidence that agn - icm feedback loops on those scales in the cores of relatively undisturbed clusters are central to the properties of those icms @xcite .",
    "the focus of our discussion here , instead , is the consequences of agn outflow encounters with cluster scale icm flow structures ( especially shocks ) , and , in particular , impact on the consequent dynamical form of the agn structures that develop as the agn plasma penetrates and generate cavities in the icm .    specifically , we explore major distortions to the agn flows and the potential for using such distortions to identify and characterize icm flow structures , including shocks . in subsequent publications",
    "we will present analyses of high resolution 3d mhd simulations of agn outflows in related dynamical icm situations . there",
    "we will examine details such as coherence and disruption of the agn flows , development of turbulence , magnetic field evolution , as well as relativistic electron propagation , acceleration and emissions .",
    "our purpose now is more restricted ; namely it is to outline a simple , but coherent formalism that we have found to be useful in predicting behaviors of the above simulation experiments and that hopefully captures essential physics needed to interpret observed agn interactions with dynamical icms .",
    "we note , in the context of the hedla workshop that inspired this work , that many of the dynamical components laid out below should be testable in laboratory experiments .    the best known and most widely discussed agn distortion produced by asymmetric icm interactions are those that have formed tails as a result of relative motions between the agn host galaxy and the surrounding icm .",
    "so - called `` narrow angle tailed '' ( nat ) agns , in which the originally collimated agn outflows appear deflected into a pair of quasi - parallel trails in the wake of the galaxy are especially common in disturbed clusters , where relatively high velocity icm motions are likely @xcite .",
    "if there are apparent , but less dramatic deflections , the agns are typically called `` wide angle tailed '' ( wat ) agns @xcite .",
    "both are obvious candidates as probes of icm dynamics @xcite .",
    "the idea that icm shocks encountering plasma bubbles or cavities left behind by expired agn might rejuvenate their cre populations has also been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , however , expected behaviors of active agn outflows colliding with icm shocks has not been previously outlined , although there have been several recent suggestions that observed nat agn may , in fact , be associated with cluster radio relics @xcite . here",
    "we do not address that issue directly , but do outline the essentials of dynamical encounters of that kind , in order to facilitate future discussions .",
    "basics of the formalism we outline have been in the literature for some time .",
    "our objective is to set them down as a package , extending them as needed for application to the issues at hand , while looking for parameterizations that may be useful for diagnostic purposes .",
    "we specifically target agn outflow / shock encounters , although the necessary formalism has broader applications .",
    "we also include along the way some preliminary results from simulations in order to illustrate the kinds of behaviors that result .",
    "we ignore here a number of complications that will ultimately be important to detailed models , but that do not seem essential to a `` first order '' picture . although our goal in this paper is to set out a simple set of analytic relationships , we do show illustrations of behaviors from high resolution numerical simulations that will be discussed in detail in subsequent publications .",
    "those simulations were carried out using the wombat mhd code employing a second order mhdtvd riemann solver @xcite .",
    "an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath5 was employed .",
    "steady bi - polar jets were formed within a small cylindrical volume , where the jet pressure , @xmath6 , was kept approximately equal to the ambient pressure , and the jet plasma was accelerated to a velocity , @xmath7 .",
    "all the simulations shown in this paper kept the density within the jet - source cylinder , @xmath8 , at 1% of the undisturbed ambient density .",
    "we have , however , varied these parameters to confirm relations described below .",
    "we also allowed jet power to cycle off in some cases .",
    "the simulated jets were weakly magnetized with a toroidal geometry and nominal @xmath9 within the jet - source cylinder .",
    "magnetic stresses are too small to influence dynamics at the levels relevant to this paper .",
    "the simulations did include cre ; in follow - up discussions we will discuss in detail synchrotron emission properties .",
    "that is beyond the scope of the present paper , however .",
    "the paper outline is this .",

    "[ sec : jet - wind ] we outline in simple terms the propagation of a jet into a head or tail wind ( section [ subsec : term ] ) and into a cross wind ( section [ subsec : cross ] ) that would , for instance , represent post - shock ambient conditions . for completeness section [ sec : cocoon ]",
    "sets out a simple model to estimate the form of the plasma cocoon inflated by jets nominally prior to the above interactions .",
    "typically the initial encounter between an icm shock and an agn will involve the shock penetrating the agn cocoon / cavity inflated by the agn outflow .",
    "the basic dynamics of such an encounter are qualitatively simple : the core of the cavity is crushed relatively quickly , while the perimeters of the cavity roll into a vortex ring structure @xcite .",
    "here we simply outline of the physics .",
    "consider then a planar icm shock of mach number , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of the shock in the icm and @xmath12 is the icm sound speed . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pre - shock icm pressure and mass density , while @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the icm adiabatic index .",
    "typical icm shocks will have modest mach numbers , @xmath17 , @xcite but to allow a wider application of this discussion we do not restrict @xmath18 .",
    "we then assume the shock encounters a low density cavity , which we take initially to be in pressure equilibrium with the icm ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "let the undisturbed density inside the cavity be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the initial cavity sound speed is , @xmath22 , where , acknowledging that the cavity includes relativistic plasma , we allow the cavity potentially to have an adiabatic index , @xmath23 , distinct from the icm .",
    "as the shock encounters the cavity , it penetrates at a speed @xmath24 pulling icm gas with it .",
    "pressure balance between the original cavity and un - shocked icm leads to the condition , @xmath25 .",
    "the original icm - cavity contact discontinuity ( cd ) follows the shock at a speed , @xmath26 , intermediate between the icm shock and the cavity shock . at the same time a rarefaction propagates back into the post - shock icm at the post - shock icm sound speed .",
    "pfrommer and jones @xcite presented the full , nonlinear , 1d riemann solution to this problem . here",
    "we need only a few , approximate behaviors in order to understand what happens during the encounter . generally ,",
    "even though the shock speed is greater inside the cavity , the shock strength is less than the incident shock ; that is , @xmath27 .",
    "there is no general , analytic formula for @xmath28 , although it can be found numerically from the riemann solution . in the strong shock limit , when @xmath29 , pfrommer and jones found @xmath30 ; that is @xmath31 . in the weak shock limit ( as @xmath32 ) , of course , @xmath33 . in either regime",
    "the internal shock speed considerably exceeds the incident , icm shock speed whenever @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the shock passes through the cavity much more quickly than it propagates around it .",
    "the velocity of the cd within the cavity , @xmath34 , obtained in the riemann solution is , @xmath35 this measures the cavity collapse rate .",
    "it will generally be less than @xmath36 .",
    "however , pfrommer and jones found , so long as @xmath37 and @xmath21 , that @xmath38 . under those circumstances ,",
    "the cavity is crushed ( the initial cd pushes all the way through the cavity ) _ before _ the icm shock propagates around it .",
    "we note that if the cavity has previously developed a thick boundary layer within which @xmath39 is not very small ( e.g. , through turbulent mixing ; see section [ sec : cocoon ] ) , the internal shock speed within this layer will be slower than above , but @xmath28 can remain comparable to @xmath18 through that boundary layer .",
    "this can , for instance , significantly influence such things as particle acceleration during shock passage and shock amplification of turbulence .",
    "if the initial cavity is `` round '' ( e.g. , a sphere ) , the shock intrusion into the cavity begins sooner and is usually stronger at the normal , `` point of first contact . '' on the other hand , the oblique penetration towards the extremes of the cavity boundary also generates vorticity .",
    "an initially spherical cavity will , thus , evolve into a torus , or vortex ring that mixes icm and cavity plasma @xcite .",
    "analogously , even if the cavity boundary is planar , but the shock normal is oblique to the cavity boundary , refraction of the shock and penetrating cd will produce vorticity and mixing @xcite .",
    "examples of shocks impacting icm cavities have been presented previously @xcite .",
    "outcomes are also evident in figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] .",
    "if an agn jet remains active following shock impact , so that it drives into the post - shock icm , its propagation will be modified because the post - shock icm is denser than the pre - shock icm and also because the post - shock icm plasma is put in motion by the shock . in this section",
    "we outline a toy model to address these effects .",
    "the basic geometry is illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "cartoon illustrating the basic geometry of bipolar agn jets propagating into an ambient wind.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    we approximate the dynamics as that of a jet within an ambient wind , decomposing the wind velocity into components parallel ( head wind or tail wind ) and orthogonal ( cross wind ) to the jet velocity vector , @xmath40 , near its terminus .",
    "that is , we set @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath43 ; that is , whenever there is a tail wind , @xmath44 , or a head wind , @xmath45 , the rate of advance of the jet terminus will be modified ; when @xmath46 the jet propagation will be deflected laterally .",
    "although we present the model in the context of a post - shock flow , the formalism applies to any relative motion between the agn and its ambient medium .",
    "indeed the model is essentially a merger and modest extension of classical cartoons of agn jet propagation @xcite .",
    "simply stated , jet advance and deflection are influenced by parallel and transverse ram pressures created by the wind .",
    "we begin by considering the influence of an ambient wind motion aligned with the jet velocity ; that is , consequences of @xmath43 . to keep the discussion simple we consider here only steady , collimated jets ( zero opening angle ) and homogeneous ambient media .",
    "we adopt the standard picture that the advance of the jet terminus into the icm can be expressed in terms of the propagation of a contact discontinuity that forms at the head of the jet @xcite . _",
    "relative to the agn _ , that boundary ( the jet `` head '' ) propagates at velocity , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 represents the length of the jet from the agn .",
    "there will be a bow shock propagating into the wind , ahead of the head , as well as a reverse , `` terminal '' shock in the jet .",
    "the simple , 1d cartoon model ignores these details , drawing a box around all this and assumes the jet thrust ; that is , the total jet momentum flux coming in through an area , @xmath49 , is balanced by the total wind momentum flux coming in on the opposite side of the box , again , through an area , @xmath50 . in reality , because both jet and wind plasma will , as `` back flow '' , exit the face of the box through which the jet enters ( and box sides ) , the effective sizes of the box faces need to be larger than @xmath50 .",
    "we can crudely account for this asymmetry by setting the effective area allocated to the wind , @xmath51 , to be larger than the nominal cross section of the jet .",
    "we comment , as well , that even for a collimated jet the radius , @xmath52 , will not generally be a constant along the length of the jet , especially when it becomes over or under pressured with respect to its surroundings . in that case , for instance , the propagating jet plasma will execute a sequence of expansions and rarefactions around an equilibrium radius . consequently , the jet velocity , @xmath7 , density , @xmath8 , and pressure , @xmath6 , will all vary along a real jet . our analysis here does not try to account for dynamics at that level of detail , so we will assume below that the jet has some suitably chosen characteristic radius , @xmath52 , density , @xmath8 and pressure , @xmath6 .",
    "we allow both the jet velocity and equation of state ( eos ) to be either non - relativistic or relativistic , although we will assume the propagation of the wind and the head through the wind in the agn reference frame are non - relativistic .",
    "then , the jet 4-velocity is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the lorentz factor of the jet velocity , @xmath7 , while the enthalpy density of the jet plasma in the jet plasma frame is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the internal energy density of the jet plasma , including rest mass energy , @xmath57 .",
    "the jet momentum flux density in the agn frame can be written @xcite @xmath58 the jet thrust is @xmath59 for a non - relativistic eos , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , while for a relativistic eos , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "it will be useful later on also to have expressions for the jet energy flux density in the agn frame .",

    "this makes clear that the fact that a jet velocity is close to the speed of light does not , by itself , imply a high mach number for the jet dynamics .",

    "the expression for the jet momentum flux is virtually the same for relativistic or non - relativistic jets .",
    "if , as is often the case , @xmath82 we can neglect the second term in square brackets . then , the jet thrust for either relativistic or non - relativistic flow is @xmath83 in either regime the thrust depends simply on the internal jet pressure and the internal jet mach number .    the jet luminosity is not quite so tidy , but still simple to express . for a non - relativistic eos",

    "again , in this form the relativistic and non - relativistic expressions are almost the same .",
    "the jet luminosity can , like the thrust , be described in terms of the jet pressure and mach number , but now also in terms of a jet speed , @xmath7 , ( which may @xmath93 ) .",
    "we return now to estimating the rate at which the jet terminus propagates through its surrounding plasma .",
    "the momentum flux balance condition determining the propagation velocity , @xmath94 , is actually measured in the frame of the head , so we should transform the momentum flux relations to that frame . however , provided @xmath95 , it is easy to show that the fractional change in @xmath96 is small .",

    "if @xmath103 we have the simple result @xmath104 that is , the mach number of the advance of the head relative to its ambient medium is similar to the internal mach number of the jet modified by a factor that depends mostly on the ratio of the integrated jet pressure , @xmath105 , to the integrated wind pressure ( isotropic pressure , not ram pressure ) `` across the head '' , @xmath106 . in our simulation experiments with steady , fixed axis , non - relativistic jets @xmath107 provides reasonable matches between simulated jet propagation and equations [ eq : headv - vel ] , [ eq : headv - mach ] and [ eq : headv - app ] .",
    "some insights into appropriate @xmath108 are useful going forward .",
    "our discussions relate to jets that are pressure confined as they propagate .",
    "so , we expect @xmath109 , where @xmath110 represents the pressure of whatever medium is immediately surrounding the jet",
    ". if a jet enters a region where it is out of pressure balance , it will generally expand or converge to compensate . as noted above",
    ", the pressures within simulated jets are actually quite non - uniform as a result . on average , however , we find , independent of the pressure assignd to a simulated jet at its origin , the average pressure along the propagating jet becomes roughly comparable to the ambient pressure .",
    "we also find in simulations and argue in section [ sec : cocoon ] that the pressure inside jet cocoons are commonly roughly similar to those in the undisturbed surroundings , even though the cocoon formation drives a shock into its surroundings .",
    "consequently , we expect within a factor of a few that @xmath111 . nonetheless , we leave such ratios as undetermined in our analyses , in order to reveal their roles .",
    "we note also for non - relativistic jets with non - relativistic eos that , since for both the jet and the ambient medium , @xmath76 , equation [ eq : headv - app ] can be written @xmath112 independent of @xmath108 .",
    "this recovers the commonly applied assumption that , modulo `` an efficiency factor '' ( @xmath113 ) the advance speed of the jet head is roughly the jet speed reduced by a factor of the square root of the density ratio between the ambient medium and the jet when the jet and its advance are both highly supersonic @xcite .",
    "it is further evident from these relations , as we would expect intuitively , that the advance speed of the jet with respect to the agn , @xmath114 , is greater when it propagates downstream with a wind ( a `` tail wind '' ) than if it propagates upstream into a wind ( a `` head wind '' ) .",
    "in fact a jet propagating into a sufficiently strong head wind can be stopped , or even reversed . using equation [ eq : headv - app ] the approximate condition for the head wind to stop forward progress of the head is @xmath115 we have verified this condition in our simulations ( see figure [ fig : aljet ] ) .",
    "although the above results would be applicable for any agn relative motion through its ambient medium when the agn jets are aligned with the relative motion , we introduced the issue in the context of post - shock icm flows . in that case",
    "it is useful to express these relations in terms of wind properties resulting from icm shocks . to keep it simple ,",
    "we assume that the pre - shock icm plasma was at rest with respect to the agn , although that is easily modified . again expressing the icm shock mach number as @xmath18 we have ( assuming @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 where ,",
    "as above , the subscript index ` i ' identifies the unshocked icm , and ` w ' indicates post - shock icm ( the `` wind '' ) .    applying equations [ eq : jump - d ] - [ eq : jump - a ] to equation [ eq : headstop ] we obtain an approximate relation for the strength , @xmath118 , of an icm shock that can stop the advance of an approaching jet of internal mach number , @xmath119 in a `` head on collision '' when the agn is at rest in the undisturbed icm ; namely @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",

    "then , an agn jet running head on into a shock will be stopped or reversed if the mach number of the shock is comparable to or even a bit less than the mach number of the jet .",
    "the above behaviors are illustrated in figure [ fig : aljet ] for two , simulated non - relativistic shock - jet interactions with different relative shock strengths .",
    "the views are 3d volume renderings of jet mass fraction ; that is , only plasma that originated from the agn is shown . in both cases , @xmath125 , and the shock normal was aligned with the ( bi - polar ) jet axis .",

    "both are shown at approximately the same time interval since initial contact between the shock and the left - facing ( upwind ) jet . in the bottom panel the stronger",
    "shock has left the computational domain to the right after reversing the left - facing jet and crushing the two original jet plasma cocoons and stripping them from the jets .",
    "the `` smoke ring '' to the right is the resulting vortex ring structure , whose formation out of the pre - shock cavities was outlined in the previous section .",
    "the flaring seen at the right end of the remaining ( downwind ) jet represents the head of that jet .",
    "the shocked jet plasma is unable to propagate back to the agn through the strong right - facing wind behind this shock .",
    "it is not able to refill a cocoon ( see section [ sec : cocoon ] ) .",
    "the jet remains `` naked '' .",
    "several agns in disturbed clusters have been seen that are candidates for this interaction .",

    "the tails merge at the far right into a pair of merging vortex rings that formed along the lines outlined in section [ sec : shock - cavity ] as the icm shock crushed the two jet cocoons produced before shock impact .",
    "the jets can be traced as coherent structures almost to the vortex rings .",
    "the shock itself has left the observed volume to the right at the time shown .    finally , we comment on the more complex case where an incident shock collides at an arbitrary angle with respect to the agn jet axis , or more generally when the agn jets encounter an oblique wind .",
    "since @xmath149 is initially the same for both jets , the rate of jet deflection indicated by equation [ eq : ftrans ] would , before deformation , be the same for both jets ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the aligned wind velocity , @xmath150 , has the same magnitude , but opposite sign on the two jets .",
    "the downwind jet , where @xmath151 , thus advances more rapidly . as the jets begin to be deflected , however , the upwind jet , where @xmath45 , is deflected to be more nearly transverse to the wind ( @xmath149 increases along the jet on that side ) , while the downwind jet is deflected to be more nearly aligned with the wind ( @xmath150 increases along this jet ) .",
    "consequently , the upwind jet becomes more sharply bent than the downwind jet .",
    "we have confirmed in simulations a regular transitioun along these lines between the aligned wind interactions described in section [ subsec : term ] . and cross wind interactions outlined at the beginning of this section .",
    "evidently , such asymmetries can provide information about both the relative mach numbers of the jets and a wind and the relative orientations of the wind and the jets .",
    "the shape evolution of the two jets depends distinctively on the ratio of two mach numbers as well as the orientation between the agn jet axis and the wind velocity vector , @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the resulting shape provides a means to determine both @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "also , it is obvious that if the `` weather conditions '' encountered by jets vary as they extend through the icm , additional morphological features are likely to develop that can be used to identify and characterize these icm structures .",
    "we began this discussion with an outline of shock propagation through a pre - existing cavity formed by agn outflows ; that is a jet cocoon .",
    "then we outlined propagation of the jets themselves in the post - shock flow .",
    "the shocks both crush the cocoon and may , if the wind `` stripping '' is faster than replacement from the jet terminus , remove the cocoon ( see figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] ) .",
    "we did not , however , address what might be learned from the cocoons themselves , in order to tie the pieces together , here we outline briefly some of the related physics connecting the jet propagation to the formation of the jet cocoon before shock impact . since our purpose is only to lay out a rough picture of cocoon inflation ,",
    "we ignore in this section complications such as relative motions between the agn and its ambient icm , the presence of large scale pressure or density gradients , or icm turbulence .",
    "all of these will modify cocoon morphology and quantitative measures , although they should not fundamentally change the basic picture presented here .    in simple terms",
    "the cocoon represents the reservoir of plasma that has previously passed through the jet .",
    "the cocoon plasma will generally be of substantially lower density than the surrounding icm , with the two media nominally separated by a contact discontinuity . because it is also a `` slip surface '' , that boundary is likely to be unstable to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( khi ) , so that some degree of mixing will take place ( unless , for instance , magnetic fields in or around the cocoon are strong enough and coherent enough to stabilize the contact discontinuity @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : noshock - color ] shows volume renderings of cocoons formed from two simulated steady agn jet pairs . in each case the agn ( marked by an ` x ' ) expelled identical , but oppositely directed jets . the rendered quantity is the same passive mass fraction tracer shown in figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] . in this case",
    "the jet axis is viewed in the plane of the sky .",
    "the upper image corresponds to a @xmath125 jet pair , while the lower image represents the cocoons of a @xmath146 jet pair .",
    "the structures are viewed when @xmath155 .",
    "the jets , themselves , are faintly recognizable inside the cocoons and along the cocoon axes .",
    "the cocoon boundaries are clearly influenced by khi ; some mixing has occurred .",
    "indeed the small differences between the left and right cocoons come from detailed differences in the khi on the two sides that are seeded by the mismatch between a mathematically circular jet and a cartesian numerical grid .",
    "khi details depend on the exact placement of the agn on the numerical grid .",

    "there is a relatively clear cocoon boundary , so we assume below that the jet cocoon and the surrounding icm are cleanly separated .     jet `` backflow '' cocoons formed by @xmath125 ( * top * ) and @xmath146 ( * bottom * ) steady jets .",

    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    the energy deposition from the jet into the cocoon will generally drive a shock laterally outward into the icm .",
    "we will call this the `` inflation shock '' .",
    "provided the jet terminus propagates supersonically into the icm ( @xmath157 , equation [ eq : headv - mach ] ) there will be a bow shock attached to the jet head , which will generally merge with the inflation shock . in figure [",
    "fig : noshock - color ] the tips of the two cocoons are confined by bow shocks .",
    "the tighter `` mach cone '' of the higher mach number jet leads to `` sharper points '' in the cocoons .",
    "although the bow shock may be quite strong , both observations and simulations suggest that the inflation shock is typically rather weak .",
    "for example the @xmath146 jets shown in the bottom of figure [ fig : noshock - color ] and in figure [ fig : noshock - mach ] produce bow shocks with @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) on the nose of the jet in agreement with expectations from equation [ eq : headv - app ] .",
    "on the other hand , over much of their surfaces the accompanying both inflation shocks have mach numbers , @xmath160 for the duration of the simulation ( see figure [ fig : noshock - mach ] ) .",
    "there is no fixed value , however .",
    "the relatively small mach numbers of most of the inflation shock surfaces also point to the fact that the pressure inside the shocks and inside the cocoons is not much greater than the ambient pressure , @xmath13 ( see equation [ eq : jump - p ] ) .",
    "because these properties do not inherently lead to scale - free structures , we do not try to model cocoon formation in terms of self - similar behavior @xcite .",
    "volume rendering of the shocks associated with the @xmath146 simulation shown in the bottom image of figure [ fig : noshock - color ] .",
    "the * top * image matches the orientation of the bottom image in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] , while the * bottom * image has the jet axis rotated 40 degrees , with the left jet approaching ( so similar to figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] .",

    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    still , it makes sense to estimate the volume of the cocoon simply by comparing the work required to inflate the cocoon to the energy that has passed down the jet into the cocoon .",
    "very simply , we set @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a numerical factor that accounts for energy lost by the cocoon plasma as it inflated .",
    "accounting for adiabatic work done on the icm would lead to @xmath165 . for a non - relativistic jet with @xmath87",
    ", this would give @xmath166 , while for a jet with a relativistic eos and @xmath167 , the equivalent consequences would give @xmath168 .",
    "empirical estimates from non - relativistic simulations do , indeed , suggest @xmath169.@xcite the exact value for @xmath170 is not essential to our purposes here .    as a primitive model for cocoon geometry",
    "we assume the cocoon length is set by @xmath171 , giving @xmath172 where @xmath173 represents a characteristic cocoon cross sectional area .",
    "we do not imply in this that the cocoon cross section is constant , and , indeed , it generally will not be ( see figure [ fig : noshock - color ] ) . in practice",
    "we treat it as a geometric average cross section .",
    "to simplify our treatment further , we express the jet luminosity in the form applicable to both relativistic and non - relativistic jets suggested by equations [ eq : ljet - nonrel ] and [ eq : ljet - rel ] ; that is , @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "for a relativistic jet @xmath73 in this expression .",
    "from equation [ eq : headv - app ] we write @xmath176 combining equations [ eq : cvol - simp ] , [ eq : ljet - simp ] and [ eq : headv - simp ] gives a simple estimate for @xmath173 , @xmath177 we expect @xmath178 , and , indeed using equation [ eq : ac - nonrel ] , below , and the simulation parameters for the cocoons shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] we get consistent estimates for @xmath173 using @xmath179 .",
    "note that , if these various jet parameters are time independent , the effective cocoon cross section , @xmath173 is steady in time .",
    "that is , the ratio @xmath180 .",
    "we briefly address alternative possibilities below .    for a relativistic jet with a relativistic eos , @xmath181 , while @xmath182 , and equation",
    "[ eq : ac - gen ] becomes , @xmath183 while for a non - relativistic jet , @xmath184 the only difference between equations [ eq : ac - rel ] and [ eq : ac - nonrel ] is a relative factor @xmath185 in equation [ eq : ac - rel ] .",
    "we can see from these relations that the cocoon cross section scales with the geometric mean of the jet cross section , @xmath50 and the jet head cross section , @xmath51 .",
    "it is strongly boosted if the jet mach number is large ( especially for non - relativistic jets ) , and , with less sensitivity , to a large density contrast between the icm and the jet , @xmath186 .",
    "that is , cocoons will be somewhat fatter for jets with larger density contrast , @xmath187 , but especially fatter for larger mach numbers .",
    "we are assuming in these comments that , as argued previously , we should expect @xmath188 .",
    "the mach number sensitivity of @xmath173 is evident in a comparison of the non - relativistic jet cocoons shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] , where the only difference in the two simulations was jet mach number ; above , @xmath125 , while below , @xmath146 .",
    "the @xmath146 cocoon , in particular , is , as noted above , strongly tapered , representing the fact that the mach cone at its nose has strongly confined it .",
    "we associate @xmath173 with the mean cross sectional area , which here would be roughly midway between the agn and the jet terminus .",
    "the reader may have noticed at the same time that the cocoons from the jets shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] are relatively skinny compared to typical , observed radio galaxy cocoons .",
    "that is characteristic of the properties of moderate mach number , non - relativistic agn jet simulations that are steady and maintain a precise axis for the jets .",
    "on the other hand , if either the jet power cycles substantially or the axis of the jet wanders or precesses , the relative rate at which the jet advances is reduced @xcite . in order to maintain the same cocoon volume indicated in equation [ eq : cvol - simp ] the cross section must increase .",
    "this effect can , be roughly accounted for in equations [ eq : headv - simp ] - [ eq : ac - nonrel ] by adjusting the effective head area , @xmath51 .",
    "for instance , a precessing jet will balance its thrust during a precession period over an area , @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the instantaneous length of the jet .",
    "applied into equation [ eq : headv - simp ] the head advance rate , @xmath191 . if we maintain constant jet luminosity , @xmath192 , so @xmath193 .",
    "now , @xmath194 const , rather than @xmath180 .",
    "simultaneously , the volume swept out by the precessing jet itself will be @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the opening angle of the precession cone .",
    "this sets a scale for the effective @xmath197 .",
    "these effects both fatten the cocoons relative to what we derived above .    finally , we mention that equation [ eq : ac - rel ] predicts rather fat cocoons for high mach number relativistic jets propagating in an environment where @xmath198 .",
    "that is consistent with results of numerical simulations of relativistic hydrodynamical jets @xcite , and also simulations of jets dominated by their poynting flux ( so , internally highly relativistic ) @xcite .",
    "the plasma media in galaxy clusters , icms , are dynamical .",
    "they are stirred by many processes associated with cluster assembly .",
    "the dynamical state of an icm provides unique information about how this takes place , so it is important to find and evaluate icm dynamical conditions , especially those far away from equilibrium .",
    "x - ray observations can reveal critical information about icm thermodynamical properties , some statistical characteristics of icm dynamical states and find relatively strong shocks in higher density icm regions .",
    "but , much of the story is not visible in the x - ray window . on the other hand , agns in so - called `` radio mode ''",
    "are common in clusters , and especially in disturbed clusters .",
    "those agns expel fast plasma jets that plow through the icm .",
    "those interactions will influence the icm and its evolution .",
    "more to the point of this paper , however , is the considerable impact of icm dynamics on the trajectories and of the agn jets and the distributions of their debris . in particular , impacts between icm shocks and winds will distort and even disrupt the agn structures that form . through an understanding of how those distortions develop and",
    "how they depend on the agn and icm properties we hope to open a clearer window to revealing the dynamical structures of icms . by relating those structures to other information about the dynamical state of the cluster , and , for instance , evidence for merging , strong accretion events or gravitational disturbance by dark matter halos",
    ", these insights can provide vital probes of cluster formation processes and their relative roles .",
    "we have laid out in this paper a simple summary of some of the essential dynamical relationships involved in agn / icm interactions , with a special focus on interactions involving icm shocks .",
    "the nominal target application is icm shocks colliding with agn outflows .",
    "we pointed out , however , that the relations we developed have application to any relative motion between the agn and its immediate environment .",
    "the formalism allows agn jets that are either non - relativistic or relativistic .",
    "we set down basic relations to evaluate shock interactions with the low density cavities created by agn jets , as well as to follow the propagation of the jets within post - shock flows . for completeness",
    ", we used the same formalism to provide a basic context for the formation of the cavities themselves .",
    "one notable aspect of the relationships we derive is the essential roles of the internal mach number of the jet flow and the mach number of the icm shock .",
    "more directly , the ratio of these two mach numbers seems central to evaluating the interactions between the agn and a dynamical ambient environment .",
    "this provides a potentially useful link that can help develop quantitative understandings of icm dynamical states that otherwise are likely to remain obscure for some time .",
