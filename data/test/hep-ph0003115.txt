    ", feynman diagrams of rather general form can be obtained analytically at most up to three loops .",
    "any of these calculations is still unique and involves sophisticated algorithms and an extensive usage of computer resources ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "even the notion of the analytical calculation is changing now because the analytical results are expressed through rather special transcendental numbers which eventually have to be calculated numerically .",
    "the striking example is the calculation of massive three - loop bubbles  @xcite where the analytical results for the diagrams are represented through the quantity which is given by a two - fold infinite sum ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "not all of the multiloop feynman diagrams are equally complicated .",
    "there are some topologies of @xmath3-loop diagrams or special kinematic regimes for the external momenta which are much simpler to compute than the general @xmath3-loop case ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the increasing complication of loop calculations within perturbation theory is more and more circumvented by using different kinds of expansion for the cases where the kinematics allows one to find a small parameter .",

    "one can obtain an analytical expansion that can be used for the simplification of the calculations or for the evaluation of the exact parameters of the effective lagrangians through matching conditions .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a method to calculate the near threshold expansion of the spectral density for the class of multiloop sunset - type feynman diagrams termed water melon diagrams  @xcite .",
    "these diagrams has recently drawn some attention as a laboratory for testing some advanced methods in loop calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , water melon diagrams also have numerous phenomenological applications .",
    "the most important application of these diagrams ( as well as spectacle diagrams as their first generalization ) is the calculation of the effective potential in quantum field theory both at finite temperature and at zero temperature  @xcite . among other applications one can name the sum rule analysis of baryons in qcd both in the massless approximation and with finite mass ( the leading order correlator being the standard sunset diagram ) @xcite or the treatment of baryons in the large @xmath4 limit of qcd  @xcite which requires the calculation of @xmath5-loop water melon diagrams in the leading order .",

    "the most interesting part of our analysis of water melon diagrams is the construction of the spectral decomposition of water melon diagrams , i.e.  the determination of the discontinuity across the physical cut in the complex plane of the squared momentum . in this context",
    "a novel technique for the direct construction of the spectral density of water melon diagrams based on an integral transform in configuration space was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we develop some explicit expansions for water melon diagrams and compare them with the exact results .",
    "the purpose of this paper is a three - fold one , namely :    * to demonstrate the ease with which threshold expansions to arbitrary space - time dimensions and a general number of internal lines with arbitrary masses can be generated within a configuration space technique .",
    "the entire construction reduces to algebraic operations while the only integral encountered is a simple integral of the type of euler s gamma function . * to generate explicit forms of threshold expansions and to analyze their convergence properties .",
    "the explicit forms of threshold expansions for the simple sunset can be compared with threshold expansions that are obtained in momentum space . * to consider a case when one mass is much smaller than the others .",
    "this is an important generalization of the threshold expansion and can be analytically done within the configuration space technique .",
    "the present analysis of the threshold expansion of water melon diagrams shows the effectiveness of the configuration space technique for this topology class of feynman diagrams . on the other hand",

    "we have presented closed expressions for the generalized expansion in several particular cases and demonstrated the improvement of the convergence gained by the resummation of the smallest mass contributions .",
