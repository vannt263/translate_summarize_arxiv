    "a challenge for inflationary models is to protect the required flatness of the inflaton potential against radiative corrections .",
    "this protection can be provided by an approximate shift symmetry as in models of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "the symmetry can be broken by a controllably small amount , the most known example of this is the case of an axion field acquiring a potential from instantons .",
    "the application of this to inflation , however , requires a greater than planckian axion decay constant @xmath1 @xcite , which may not be stable against gravitational corrections @xcite and which may be impossible to realize in string theory @xcite .",
    "proposed solutions to this problem include using two @xcite or more @xcite axions , which provide an effective large scale evolution even if the decay constants of the original axions are sub - planckian , requiring nontrivial compactifications in string theory @xcite , suitably coupling the axion to a @xmath7-form @xcite , modifying the axion kinetic term @xcite , and slowing down the axion evolution through particle production @xcite as in warm inflation @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the mechanism of @xcite the dissipation occurs through the production of a u(1 ) field coupled to the inflaton @xmath0 through the interaction @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the u(1 ) field strength , and @xmath10 its dual ) .",
    "@xcite showed that this coupling can also affect the background evolution if the u(1 ) field is replaced by a su(2 ) field with a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "specifically , due to the interaction with the vev of the vector multiplet , the inflaton can be in slow roll even if its potential would otherwise ( i.e. , in absence of this interaction ) be too steep to give inflation .",
    "such a model has been dubbed _ chromo - natural inflation _ in @xcite .",

    "we note that , for a generic theory with vector fields , an isotropic solution may be unstable against anisotropic perturbations .",
    "for instance , this can be the case when a dilaton - like coupling @xmath22 of a scalar inflaton @xmath23 to a su(2 ) field with the vev ( [ a - vev ] ) or to an orthogonal u(1 ) triplet is arranged so to produce a scale invariant spectrum for the vectors .",

    "the study of the chromo - natural inflation theory at the perturbative level was recently performed in @xcite , for @xmath24 where @xmath3 is the mass of the vector field fluctuations in this limit @xcite ( as we also discuss below ) . when this condition is realized , the vector field can be integrated out while , at the same time , leaving its mark on the inflationary dynamics ( this is an explicit realization of the so called _ gelaton _",

    ", chromo - natural inflation is equivalent to a single scalar field @xmath25 theory ( where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the non - canonical kinetic term precisely encodes the effect of the gauge fields .",
    "in @xcite it is also shown that an effective field theory equivalence of chromo - natural inflation to a non - canonical @xmath28 lagrangian holds as long as @xmath29 . beyond this limit",
    ", a general perturbative study of the dynamics of the gauge field and the axion becomes necessary in order to test the stability of the theory and formulate its predictions .",
    "this is precisely the scope of the present work .",
    "we perform a full linear order study of scalar , tensor and vector perturbations and we show that the inflationary background solution of the model is stable for @xmath30 , and it is otherwise unstable .",
    "a full phenomenological study of the model is beyond our purposes .",
    "nonetheless , we explore the scalar and tensor modes production for a given choice of @xmath31 and @xmath32 for which the coupling with the vector fields is crucial to ensure slow - roll . specifically , we choose @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , while @xmath35 is a free parameter controlled by the value of @xmath36 .",
    "the stability condition @xmath37 provides a lower bound for this ratio .",
    "too small values are also excluded because they lead to a too red spectrum of the scalar modes ( we obtained this numerically ; this behavior is also seen in the analytic study of @xcite in the regime of validity of their analysis ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the amount of gravity wave signal increases with @xmath35 , and a level which can be observed in the current or forthcoming experiments @xcite can be obtained even if the inflaton in the model spans a range of some orders of magnitude below @xmath38 , evading the so called lyth bound @xcite ( in contrast to what was expected in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , requiring a stable solution , with a sufficiently flat scalar power spectrum , and sufficiently small tensor modes provides constraints on the parameters of the model that go in opposite directions . for our choice @xmath33 , and @xmath34 we could not find any acceptable solution .",
    "we expect that the situation should improve at larger @xmath1 , where the inflaton potential becomes flatter ( and the model approaches conventional slow roll inflation ) .",

    "[ sec : model ] we review the background evolution of the model for different ( stable or unstable ) ranges of the theory ; in sec .  [",
    "sec : eqs - perturbations ] we start the perturbation analysis by introducing the most general decomposition of the metric , the inflaton , and the gauge field fluctuations , identifying the physical degrees of freedom and verifying that scalar , vector and tensor perturbations decouple at linear order ; we also quantize the system and define the cosmological correlators ; in secs .",
    "[ sec : tensors ] , [ sec : vectors ] and [ sec : scalars ] we study the fluctuations for , respectively , tensor , vector and scalar modes ; finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",

    "chromo - natural inflation is described by the action ( [ action ] ) of a pseudo - scalar field @xmath0 coupled to an @xmath39 gauge multiplet .",
    "the vector multiplet has the vev ( [ a - vev ] ) .",
    "the _ 00 _ component of einstein equations reads @xmath40 inflation can only occur if the potential @xmath41 is the major contribution to the total energy density , i.e. @xmath42 ; the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are all much smaller than unity .",
    "+ the equations of motion for the inflaton and the gauge field are : @xmath47 if we neglect @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , one can solve eqs .",
    "( [ eqone]-[eqtwo ] ) for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite @xmath53 in these equations we then assume @xmath54 and we obtain @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ eqthree ] ) can be rewritten as an equation of motion for the gauge field in terms of an effective potential @xmath56 where @xmath57 is minimized by @xmath58 in the minimum , the two terms of @xmath57 are parametrically equal to each other .",
    "therefore , the same is true for the last two terms in ( [ eqfour ] ) .",
    "as a consequence , the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eqfour ] ) dominates over the other two in the regime @xmath59 studied in @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xcite @xmath60    for general values of the parameters , inserting @xmath61 , eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) becomes @xmath62 by looking at eq .",
    "( [ eqone ] ) , one realizes that , when the gauge field settles in its minimum , it originates an actual damping term for the motion of the axion .",
    "notice also that , when @xmath63 , the kinetic energy of the fields can be disregarded ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ eqthree ] ) ) ; therefore the slow - roll parameter ( which would normally receive contributions also from @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) will be , instead , mostly due to @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath68 finally we have @xmath69 from eq .",

    "the slow roll solutions read @xmath81 where we have defined @xmath82    figure [ fig : bck ] allows to appreciate the accuracy of these slow roll approximations . in the figure",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath51 for four choices of @xmath72 , comparing the exact evolution with the slow roll approximation ( [ slow ] ) . ; we then employ ( [ slow ] ) to have the initial value for @xmath51 and @xmath83 .",
    "we set @xmath84 , and we then obtain the initial value for @xmath85 by solving the @xmath86 einstein equations exactly at the initial time .",
    "we make sure that the initial value of @xmath0 leads to more than @xmath87 e - folds of inflation ( so that the slow - roll solution can be achieved ; we note that the system starts slightly displaced from the slow roll solution , since we set @xmath84 ; the displacement is however very small , since @xmath88 in the slow roll solution , and the background evolution quickly approaches the slow roll solution ) .",
    "the evolutions shown in figure [ fig : bck ] are restricted to the final @xmath87 e - folds of inflation . ] in all cases , we take @xmath89 , as the main purpose of this model is to allow slow roll for @xmath31 . this is `` compensated '' by @xmath32 , and in all cases we fixed for definiteness @xmath34 .",
    "we note that fixing the value of @xmath72 does specify a relation between @xmath90 and @xmath36 , but does not fix these two values .",
    "as typical in inflationary models , the parameters can be specified only from fixing the normalization of the power spectrum of the scalar modes to the observed value @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the evolutions shown in the figure cover @xmath87 e - folds of inflation .",
    "we note from the figure that @xmath51 performs very small oscillations around the slow roll solution .",
    "we believe that they are due to the fact that @xmath92 is tracking a time dependent minimum ( [ qmin ] ) ( we do not show this here , but also this tracking is extremely accurate during the slow roll phase ) .",
    "the oscillations appear somewhat large in the logarithmic scale chosen , but we see that they do not lead to any net departure from the slow roll solution .",
    "moreover , in section [ sec : scalars ] we compare full numerical solutions of the scalar perturbations , obtained using the full numerical background solutions , with analytical solutions , for which the slow roll approximations are used , and we also find excellent agreement . as we discussed after eq .",
    "( [ efolds2 ] ) , decreasing @xmath72 in the @xmath93 region , while keeping the other parameters ( including the initial value of @xmath0 ) fixed , decreases the amount of inflation . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath94 can result in sufficient inflation only if the inflaton is initially close to the top of the potential .",
    "another way to express this is to note that the inflaton rolls faster as @xmath72 decreases ( with the other parameters kept fixed ) , as it is clear both from the slow roll expression ( [ slow ] ) and from the figure .",
    "perhaps the most surprising feature of the model is that , although all the solutions shown in figure [ fig : bck ] appear to be acceptable inflationary solutions ( in all cases the slow roll solution appears to be an attractor ; we note however that the background dynamics only probes homogeneous departures from the slow roll solution ) , and although they only differ from each other by the value of @xmath72 , the background solution with @xmath95 is unstable , while the other ones are stable .",
    "this emerges from the study of the scalar perturbations around these solutions that we perform below .",
    "in this section we discuss at the formal level how we compute , we quantize , and we solve the linearized theory for the perturbations of the model around the background solution discussed in the previous section .",
    "the discussion is divided in two subsections . in the first subsection",
    "we discuss how the perturbations can be divided into three groups , decoupled from each other at the linearized level . in the second subsection",
    "we give the form of the quadratic action and we discuss how we compute the corresponding linearized theory for the perturbations .",

    "we denote as `` tensor modes '' the perturbations @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which we impose to be transverse ( @xmath104 ) and traceless ( @xmath105 ) ; due to these properties , the tensor sector contains @xmath7 perturbations .",
    "we denote as `` vector modes '' the perturbations @xmath106 , which we impose to be transverse ( @xmath107 ) ; due to this , the vector sector contains @xmath98 perturbations .",
    "we denote as `` scalar modes '' the remaining @xmath108 perturbations .",
    "we point out that the terms  tensor / vector / scalar \" are appropriate for the perturbations of the metric and of the inflaton , as they indicate how these modes transform under a spatial rotation .",
    "we extend this terminology also to the perturbations of the vector field , following the notation of @xcite , even if , strictly speaking , these terms are inappropriate ( given that the su(2 ) index has been used in the decomposition ) .",
    "we nonetheless adopt it since the fact that the vector vev is diagonal ( @xmath109 ) plus the transversality properties that we have imposed guarantee that the tensor / vector / sectors that we have defined above remain decoupled from each other at the linearized level @xcite .",
    "we fourier transform these modes @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes any of the perturbations , and we study the theory in fourier space . in our stability study , we solve for the perturbations at the linearized level , and therefore we study a mode with a given momentum @xmath112 ( modes of different momenta are coupled to each other at the nonlinear level ) .",
    "we can actually fix the orientation of @xmath112 along the @xmath113axis without loss of generality . starting from a general direction for @xmath112 , we rotate the coordinates so that @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the unit vector along the @xmath113axis , and @xmath116 . after a general rotation ,",
    "@xmath117 is no longer proportional to @xmath118 ; however we can re - obtain @xmath119 through a global su(2 ) rotation .",
    "therefore , we can set @xmath120 without loss of generality .",
    "this choice simplifies our algebra .",
    "we need to remove the redundancy associated to general coordinate and su(2 ) transformations . under an infinitesimal coordinate transformation with parameter @xmath121 , @xmath122 and we remove the freedom of infinitesimal coordinate transformations by setting @xmath123 . consider instead an su(2 ) transformation with infinitesimal parameter @xmath124 ( with @xmath125 transverse ) . under this transformation ,",
    "@xmath126 and we can fix the su(2 ) freedom by setting @xmath127 . clearly , also other modes of the metric and of the gauge field change under these transformations , and different gauge choices can be made .",
    "our choices are motivated by the fact that ( i ) they completely fix the freedom , and ( ii ) they preserve all the @xmath128 and @xmath129 modes .",
    "these perturbations are nondynamical , as they enter in the quadratic action of the perturbations without time derivative , and can be immediately integrated out .    with our gauge choices , and with @xmath130 , the decomposition ( [ deco1 ] )",

    "the canonical variable @xmath318 obeys @xmath319 with the dispersion relation @xmath320 . as a consequence @xmath321 outside the horizon , corresponding to a frozen amplitude of @xmath322",

    "this study is beyond the purposes of the present work . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we have however computed the power spectrum of @xmath331 for some sample choices of parameters .",

    "we stress that our choice of @xmath332 and @xmath34 is only dictated by the requirement of @xmath343 , so that the coupling to the gauge field plays a relevant role for the inflation dynamics ( which , in turns , is the initial purpose of the model @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , these values can be changed , and our phenomenology discussion has the only purpose of understanding what kind of limits can be imposed on the model .",
    "we expect that a viable region will exist at larger @xmath1 ( and smaller @xmath297 ) , as the model becomes closer to a free inflaton model slowly rolling on a flat potential .    at the theoretical level",

    "the single exception is the @xmath235 entry of @xmath142 , for which the agreement persists during the entire sub - horizon regime , at horizon crossing , and also up to @xmath236 , but not further .",
    "this proves that the stability study performed in the main text is valid also when the metric perturbations are included , given that the instability , when present , manifests itself deeply inside the horizon .",
    "most likely , this guarantees that also the power spectra shown in the main text are accurate , since the disagreement manifests itself only after the powers have frozen ( see figure [ fig : pkt ] ) .",

    "<S> we perform the complete stability study of the model of chromo - natural inflation ( adshead and wyman 12 ) , where , due to its coupling to a su(2 ) vector , a pseudo - scalar inflaton @xmath0 slowly rolls on a steep potential . as a typical example </S>",
    "<S> , one can consider an axion with a sub - planckian decay constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model was recently studied ( dimastrogiovanni , fasiello , and tolley 12 ) in the @xmath2 limit , where @xmath3 is the mass of the fluctuations of the vector field , and @xmath4 the hubble rate . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inflationary solution is stable for @xmath5 , while it otherwise experiences a strong instability due to scalar perturbations in the sub - horizon regime . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor perturbations are instead enhanced at large @xmath3 , while the vector ones remain perturbatively small . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the parameters , this model can give a chiral gravity wave signal that can be detected in ongoing or forthcoming cmb experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this detection can occur even if , during inflation , the inflaton spans an interval of size @xmath6 which is some orders of magnitude below the planck scale , evading a well known bound that holds for a free inflaton ( lyth 97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral tilt of the scalar perturbations typically decreases with decreasing @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the simultaneous requirements of stability , sufficiently small tensor - to - scalar ratio , and sufficiently flat scalar spectrum can pose nontrivial bounds on the parameters of the model .    </S>",
