    "over the past decade , the search for sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has begun to focus upon small scale anisotropy in event arrival directions .",
    "this refers to statistically significant excesses occurring at the scale of @xmath1 .",
    "the interest in this sort of anisotropy has largely been fueled by the observations of the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) . in 1999",
    "@xcite and again in 2001 @xcite , the agasa collaboration reported observing what eventually became seven clusters ( six `` doublets '' and one `` triplet '' ) with estimated energies above @xmath2  ev .",
    "several attempts that have been made to ascertain the significance of these clusters returned chance probabilities of @xmath3 @xcite to 0.08 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the monocular ( and stereo ) analyses that have been presented by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) demonstrate that the level of autocorrelation observed in our sample is completely consistent with that expected from background coincidences @xcite .",
    "any analysis of hires monocular data needs to take into account that the angular resolution in monocular mode is highly asymmetric .",
    "it is very difficult to compare the results of the hires monocular and agasa analyses .",
    "they are very different in the way that they measure autocorrelation .",
    "differences in the published energy spectra of the two experiments suggest an energy scale difference of 30% @xcite . additionally , the two experiments observe uhecrs in very different ways .",
    "the hires experiment has an energy - dependent aperture and an exposure with a seasonal variability @xcite .",
    "these differences make it very difficult get an intuitive grasp of what hires should see if the agasa claim of autocorrelation is justified . in order to develop this sort of intuition",
    ", we apply the same analysis to both agasa and hires data .",
    "the data set that we consider consists of events that were included in the hires - i monocular spectrum measurement @xcite .",
    "this set contains 52 events observed between may  1997 and february  2003 with measured energies greater than @xmath0  ev . the data set represents a cumulative exposure of @xmath4  km@xmath5sr@xmath6yr at @xmath7  ev .",
    "this data was subject to a number of quality cuts that are detailed in the above - mentioned papers @xcite .",
    "we previously verified that this data set was consistent with monte carlo predictions in many ways including impact parameter ( @xmath8 ) distributions @xcite and zenith angle distributions @xcite . for this study , we presumed an average atmospheric clarity @xcite .    in order to calculate the autocorrelation function for this subset of data , we must first parameterize the hires - i monocular angular resolution . for a monocular air fluorescence detector ,",
    "angular resolution consists of two components , the plane of reconstruction , that is the plane in which the shower is observed , and the angle @xmath9 within the plane of reconstruction ( see figure  [ figure : picture ] ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we can see the result of these simulations .",
    "the observed hires - i signal corresponds to the 90% confidence upper limit with the inclusion of only 3.5 doublets beyond random background coincidence .",
    "if we repeat this analysis with first , a 7.5% reduction in the estimated angular resolution values and second , a 7.5% increase in the estimated angular resolution values , we obtain a range for the 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath10 $ ] doublets and a range for the 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath11 $ ] doublets .",
    "a final area of concern is the systematic uncertainty in the determination of atmospheric clarity .",
    "because hourly atmospheric observations are not available for the entire hires - i monocular data set , we have relied upon the use of an average atmospheric profile for the reconstruction of our data @xcite . while different atmospheric conditions have negligible impact on the determination of the arrival direction for events with measured energies this high , differing conditions can have an impact on energy estimation and thus the number of events that are included in our data set . over the @xmath12 error space for our estimation of atmospheric conditions , the total number of events in our data set fluctuates on the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the value of the observable , @xmath14}$ ] , has a fluctuation on the interval @xmath15 $ ] owing to addition and subtraction of events from the data set .",
    "note that in neither case does the value of @xmath14}$ ] exceed the mean value ( 0.99250 ) expected for a background set .",
    "we conclude that the hires - i monocular detector sees no evidence of clustering in its highest energy events . furthermore , the hires - i monocular data has an intrinsic sensitivity to global autocorrelation such that we can claim at the 90% confidence level that there can be no more than 3.5 doublets above that which would be expected by background coincidence in the hires - i monocular data set above @xmath0  ev . from this result",
    ", we can then derive , with a 90% confidence level , that no more than 13% of the observed hires - i events could be sharing common arrival directions .",
    "this data set is comparable to the sensitivity of the reported agasa data set if one assumes that there is indeed a 30% energy scale difference between the two experiments .",
    "it should be emphasized that this conclusion pertains only to point sources of the sort claimed by the agasa collaboration .",
    "furthermore , because a measure of autocorrelation makes no assumption of the underlying astrophysical mechanism that results in clustering phenomena , we can not claim that the hires monocular analysis and the agasa analysis are inconsistent beyond a specified confidence level .",
