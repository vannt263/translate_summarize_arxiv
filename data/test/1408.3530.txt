    "the theory of swimming of microorganisms in a viscous fluid is based on low reynolds number hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "inertia can be neglected and the relatively simple time - independent stokes equations can be used .",
    "nonetheless the mechanism of swimming is subtle and the study of the phenomenon has led to much fascinating theoretical work @xcite-@xcite .",
    "many microorganisms have the form of a large passive head propelled by a flagellum or tail . in the following",
    "we study the swimming of such structures for a simple model system , in which the tail is composed of little spheres which can move relative to each other and push or pull the head , taken to be a sphere of large radius . a model of this kind with two little spheres pushing a big one",
    "was first studied by golestanian @xcite .",
    "we consider in our explicit calculations two or three little spheres pushing a spherical head .",
    "the three - sphere swimmer by itself is effective @xcite,@xcite , whereas a two - sphere swimmer , by itself in infinite fluid and with only collinear relative motions , does not swim at all according to purcell s scallop theorem @xcite . in principle",
    "both longitudinal and transverse motions can be considered . in the longitudinal model the two or three little spheres and the big one",
    "are assumed to be aligned with motions and forces directed along the common axis . in the transverse model the spheres",
    "are again aligned but the forces are directed perpendicular to the axis . the swimming is a second order effect due to longitudinal or transverse waves propagating along the tail which couple to motion along the axis via the nonlinearity of hydrodynamic interactions . in numerical calculations",
    "the number of little spheres can be easily varied .",
    "we employ a dynamic picture in which the forces acting on the individual spheres are decomposed into harmonic direct interactions and actuating forces summing to zero @xcite .",
    "the picture allows explicit study of the effect of the elastic direct interaction .",
    "a similar model of the flagellum has been studied in simulation by lowe et al .",
    "a flagellum with transverse motion is probably more relevant in nature .",
    "a complex active three - sphere longitudinal swimmer involving elastic forces has been studied by gnther and kruse @xcite . in these earlier calculations",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions were simplified as oseen point interactions .",
    "some experimental realizations of artificial swimming involve predominantly a flagellar motion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "other experiments on pumping and swimming have involved harmonic traps @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the present calculation is based on an approximation to the mobility matrix valid in the limit where the little spheres are at a mutual distance much larger than their radius , but much less than the radius of the big sphere . the hydrodynamic interaction between head and tail",
    "is calculated from the exact green function of the stokes equations for the geometry of a fixed sphere with no - slip boundary condition , derived by oseen @xcite , as generalized to a moving sphere @xcite .",
    "we assume that the forces are sufficiently small that the bilinear theory of swimming can be employed . in secs .",
    "ii - iv we discuss the longitudinal model in detail .",
    "corresponding results for the transverse model are more difficult to derive . in sec .",
    "v we compare the results of the bilinear theory with a numerical solution of the equations of motion for the longitudinal model of three little spheres and a big one .",
    "we find interesting behavior of swimming speed and rate of dissipation as functions of the ratio of the radius of the big sphere to that of the little spheres .",
    "the calculations show that estimates of the swimming speed based on stokes law @xcite and so - called resistive force theory @xcite-@xcite do not take proper account of hydrodynamic interactions and lead to an incorrect dependence of the swimming speed on the radius of the big sphere .",
    "in the following we consider a collinear swimmer consisting of @xmath0 spheres with centers located sequentially on the @xmath1 axis of a cartesian system of coordinates and linked together by nearest neighbor harmonic interactions . specifically we consider a bead - spring chain for which the first @xmath2 beads have the same radius @xmath3 , and the last one , labeled @xmath0 , has radius @xmath4 .",
    "the first @xmath2 spheres will jointly be called the tail or flagellum , and the last sphere will be called the head .",

    "the flow velocity and pressure are determined instantaneously by the sphere velocities .",
    "the swimming behavior will be studied in the framework of the bilinear theory of swimming , in which the swimming velocity and the rate of dissipation are evaluated to second order in the amplitude of displacements of the spheres from their equilibrium positions .",
    "the displacements are assumed to vary harmonically in time with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the positions of centers correspond to an @xmath2-dimensional vector of relative positions @xmath12 given by @xmath13 the equilibrium positions correspond to relative positions @xmath14 .",
