    "virus particles ( virions ) come in a variety of sizes and shapes .",
    "however , approximately spherical shapes with diameters in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 are especially common .",
    "many nearly spherical viruses are revealed by x - ray crystallography to have icosahedral symmetry .",
    "a typical virus particle contains genetic material , rna or dna , surrounded by a protein coat ( capsid ) .",
    "such an object should have reasonably distinct vibrational frequencies , the study of which may be of interest .",
    "excitation of these vibrations could have applications in either the diagnosis or treatment of viral diseases . to this author",
    "s knowledge , the sole discussion of these vibrational modes in the literature is that of babincov _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "these authors discuss the conjecture that ultrasound in the ghz range could be resonantly absorbed by hiv virus particles , leading to their destruction .",
    "et al _  @xcite have recently reported the detection of viruses by acoustic oscillations .",
    "however , the process of `` rupture event scanning '' , which these authors report , involves the separation of a virus particle from antibodies by ultrasound .",
    "this is distinct from the excitation of the vibrational modes of the virus particle itself , and occurs at much lower frequencies .",
    "there have also been some experimental studies of ultrasonic absorption by empty viral capsids  @xcite .",
    "these experiments reveal an enhanced absorption in the mhz range as proteins reassemble into a capsid , but do not find a resonant peak in this frequency range .",
    "witz and brown  @xcite have emphasized that these and other results show that viral capsids are flexible and change size or shape in response to vibrations or to changes in temperature or ph .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide some estimates of the lowest vibrational frequencies of a spherical virus particle .",
    "the simplest estimate is to take this frequency to be of the order of a characteristic speed of sound divided by the size of the virus particle .",
    "this is the estimate used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the purpose of giving a more accurate estimate",
    ", we will examine two models , which treat the particle ( 1 ) as a liquid drop and ( 2 ) as a uniform elastic sphere .",
    "similar models have been used by bulatov _",
    "@xcite to estimate the vibrational frequencies of nanoclusters .",
    "consider a sphere of radius @xmath3 filled with a nonviscous liquid with surface tension @xmath4 and mass density @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest vibrational mode of this sphere will be a quadrupole mode with frequency  @xcite @xmath6 which can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass density and surface tension for water , respectively . the surface tension and mass density , along with the lowest vibrational frequency derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_drop ] ) for @xmath10 , are given in table 1 for several liquids .",
    ".the mass density , surface tension , and the lowest vibrational frequency predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_drop ] ) for drops of various liquids with a radius of @xmath10 .",
    "the data for benzene and diethylene glycol  @xcite are for droplets in air at room temperature .",
    "the data for the three proteins  @xcite are for aqueous solutions at approximately @xmath11 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that for a wide range of materials , the lowest mode of vibration is a purely radial mode with a frequency of the order of a few times @xmath12 for a sphere of radius @xmath10 .",
    "in the previous sections , we have examined two models for a spherical virus particle , a liquid drop model and an elastic sphere model .",
    "it is of interest that the two models yield estimates for the lowest vibrational frequency which differ by only about one order of magnitude .",
    "of the two models , the elastic sphere model is probably the better description of a virus particle .",
    "an even better model might be one in which the particle has a liquid core ( dna or rna ) surrounded by an elastic outer shell ( the capsid ) .",
    "such a model would probably yield vibrational frequencies intermediate between those predicted by the two models discussed in this paper . in any case",
    ", we obtain an estimate for the lowest vibrational frequency of the same order of magnitude as that given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the range of a few ghz for particles with a size of about @xmath13 .",
    "of course , the existence of a resonance requires that damping be below the critical value above which overdamped motion occurs .",
    "even if this condition is fulfilled , it is difficult to predict the width of the resonance .",
    "this remains a question for experimental investigation .",
    "the existence of well defined resonances could prove valuable both for basic science and for medicine .",
    "thus this is a potentially fruitful area for further research ."
