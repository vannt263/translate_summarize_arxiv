    "systems of particles with long range interactions are those which inter - particle potential at large separation decays slower than the dimension @xmath0 of space , i.e. , @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "there are many examples in nature , such as self - gravitating systems in the cosmological and astrophysical context ( the large structure of the universe , galaxies , etc ) , interaction between vortices in two - dimensional hydrodynamics , cold classical atoms or capillary interactions between colloids or granular media ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of systems present very particular properties in thermal equilibrium , such that negative micro - canonical specific heat or inequivalence of statistical ensembles .",
    "their dynamics is also peculiar compared to short range systems : in a first stage there is the generic formation in a few characteristic times @xmath3 of a long - lived non - equilibrium state  during the so - called _ violent relaxation _ process .",
    "a typical example of such quasi - stationary states ( hereafter qss ) are galaxies or young globular clusters .",
    "then , a comparatively very slow relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium occurs  called _ collisional relaxation _  in a timescale of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of particles and @xmath6 depends on the system studied .",
    "the mechanism of collisional relaxation is still not well understood . in the context of gravitational systems , chandrasekhar found theoretically , in a seminal work @xcite , an estimate of the relaxation time for gravitational systems in three dimensions .",
    "he considered an homogeneous system and computed the change in velocity due to successive independent collisions effects '' .",
    "] of a test particle in a stationary macroscopic configuration .",
    "because of the hypothesis of homogeneity there is no macroscopic scale in the system , which led to an ongoing controversy about the value of the maximal impact parameter of the collisions and in particular how it should scale with @xmath5 @xcite . following this , several studies considered collective effects ( e.g. @xcite ) , but still in homogeneous configurations .",
    "an explicit theoretical description of the collisional relaxation in inhomogeneous systems is technically much more difficult to derive , being necessary the use of action - angle variables .",
    "this description is still lacking , despite recent progress in this direction @xcite , for a recent review see e.g. @xcite .    the collisional relaxation has also been studied numerically , for a wide variety of systems . for one - dimensional gravity",
    ", a scaling of @xmath7 has been measured for the full relaxation process @xcite , and in the hamiltonian mean field model the scaling has been found to be dependent on the initial condition : @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite . for dimensions larger than @xmath10 , the relaxation has been estimated studying  for numerical reasons  only its early stage , i.e. , for times in which the qss is weakly perturbed ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or performing simulations with a simplified dynamics . for gravity in two - dimensions , in simulations performed imposing radial symmetry , it has been observed @xmath11 @xcite . in @xmath12 dimensions ,",
    "the chandrasekhar scaling @xmath13 has been verified for gravity ( e.g. @xcite ) and for power - law potential @xmath14 , for which has been found @xmath15 if @xmath16 , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the collisional relaxation of a self - gravitating system in @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "the interacting potential  solution of the poisson equation in @xmath17 dimensions  is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the coupling constant .",
    "it is an attractive model because it presents the same mechanism of collisions as in @xmath12 ( which is not the case for models in @xmath10 ) , the system is self - confined ( it is not necessary to confine it artificially in a box ) , thermal equilibrium properties are easily calculated and numerical simulations are easier to perform than in @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , it was found in @xcite , using simulations imposing the radial symmetry ( particles conserve their initial angular momentum ) , that the collisional relaxation scales with the number of particles in the unexpected manner @xmath20 . in the way in which these simulations have been performed",
    "the actual model is quasi one - dimensional , and this result may be in some connection with the striking relaxation time for the hmf model , in which for some initial conditions it has been found to scale as @xmath8 .",
    "another question that will be addressed in this paper is the fact that it has been observed that the chandrasekhar approximation  or _ local approximation _  gives good estimation of the relaxation time not only in homogeneous systems but also in non - homogeneous configurations ( see ) , and in particular how it scales ( in a non - trivial way ) with the number of particles @xmath5 and the minimal impact parameter @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility to describe , in a good approximation , the whole collisional relaxation process using this approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in which the system is treated as locally homogeneous .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the sect .",
    "[ theory ] , we show that , if the qss which is collisionally relaxing is approximately homogeneous in its center  as it is for many initial conditions for gravitational system in @xmath17 and @xmath12  then treating the system as homogeneous ( but finite ) is a reasonable approximation .",
    "then , we compute the diffusion coefficients and , neglecting collective effects , we write a fokker ",
    "planck equation which describes the evolution of the system . in sect .",
    "[ simulations ] , we report simulations using molecular dynamics of the relaxation of the system , for the whole time range between the qss and the final thermal equilibrium , for two different initial conditions and different number of particles .",
    "we will see , that despite the many approximations , the evolution of the velocity pdf is reasonably well described by the theory for intermediate values of the velocity . in sect .  [",
    "sect - chandra ] will discuss the validity of the chandrasekhar approximation . in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] we present the conclusions of this study and further perspectives .",
    "we model the generic evolution of the system using the boltzmann equation for the one point probability density function @xmath21 .",
    "we can write it formally as [ vfp ] + + = _ c[f ] , where @xmath22 $ ] is the collision operator . during the relaxation process",
    ", the system reaches first a qss and then evolves ( comparatively slowly ) through an infinity sequence of qss , in which [ aprox ] + = 0 . to make eq .",
    "tractable analytically , we will assume that eq .",
    "holds for all times , which implies not taking collective effects into account .",
    "we will focus in this paper on the evolution of the velocity pdf s(,t)=d^2rf(,,t ) .",
    "we integrate eq .   over the positions , obtaining , in the approximation [ vfp - vel ] = d^2r_c[f ] .",
    "in the same manner as in the most studied @xmath12 case , the relaxation is dominated by _ weak collisions _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "i.e. , the ones for which the trajectories of the particles are weakly perturbed . moreover , it has been shown that , for times larger than one orbital period , the force correlation function decays rapidly ( e.g. as @xmath23 for gravity in @xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "we may then consider that collisions are independent and the use of a fokker - planck approximation of eq .",
    "is therefore justified ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which can be written as [ vfp - simp ] = + , where the diffusion coefficients are defined as average change of the velocity of the particles per unit of time , i.e. , [ diff - coeff ] @xmath24 in eqs .   and we have assumed that the diffusion coefficients are a well defined quantity to describe the relaxation process in an inhomogeneous system .",
    "we will see in what follows to what extent it is a good approximation .",
    "the strategy to compute the diffusion coefficients is the following : because collisional relaxation is dominated by weak collisions , i.e. , by the ones in which the trajectory of the particles are weakly perturbed ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the diffusion coefficients can be calculated computing changes in velocity of the particles considering that they are evolving on their unperturbed orbits ( i.e. the ones which corresponds to the mean field @xmath25 limit ) . in subsect .",
    "[ mean - field - potential ] we will then first estimate the mean mean potential in which the particles are evolving , in subsect .",
    "[ comp - change - vel ] we will then compute the change in velocity due to one collision and finally in subsect .",
    "[ comp - diff - coeff ] we will compute the diffusion coefficients themselves .",
    "we are going to assume that in the region in which particles are collisionally relaxing the density pdf is homogeneous .",
    "this distribution generates a harmonic gravitational field .",
    "we will see in our simulations ( see sect .",
    "[ simulations ] ) that it is a very good approximation .",
    "moreover , the this is also true for the thermal equilibrium state , which is the final state the system will reach . at thermal equilibrium the potential generated by the qss ( see e.g. @xcite ) [ pot_mb ] ( r)=(^2+r^2 ) where @xmath26 is a constant which depends on the total energy of the system limit is taken in such a way that @xmath27 , which is equivalent to keep the dynamical time of the system invariant changing @xmath5 , see eq .  .",
    "we keep here the dependence on @xmath5 to have an explicit dependence on @xmath3 in our equations . ] . for @xmath28 ( which corresponds to a scale",
    "in which are included half of the particles ) , the potential is harmonic , i.e. , [ pot_mb_taylor ] ( r)gn+ ^2 r^2 , where ^2=. under the hypothesis that the potential has the form , the trajectories of the particles in the central region of the system ( where collisional relaxation occurs ) can be then well approximated with ellipses .",
    "the relative motion of two particles is also therefore an ellipse which can be written as [ elip ] ( t)=x_0(t)x + y_0(t)y , as it has been sketched in fig .",
    "[ orbit ] .",
    "we expect that the hypothesis is relatively general : it has been shown numerically in @xmath12 that , for a wide set of initial conditions , the qss present also a central homogeneous region which decays rapidly to zero at larger scales @xcite .",
    "in the context of long range systems , we define a `` collision '' between two particles as the process in which they cross each other in half an orbital period ( one crossing of the system ) .",
    "assuming that the relative orbits have the form of eq .",
    "we can compute the change in relative velocity in the @xmath29 direction of two crossing particles by integrating the gravitational acceleration @xmath30 projected in the @xmath29 direction over the duration of a collision : [ delta_vy ] |_y|&=&2g_0^ dt + & & 2 g _ 0^ + & = & 2 g . from geometrical arguments , it is possible to see that most of the orbits will have large ellipticity .",
    "for example , in our simulations we find @xmath31 on average ( see sect .  [ sect - chandra ] ) .",
    "if we choose the axis in order @xmath32 , then , if the condition [ large_elip ] y_0x_0 , holds , eq .   can be well approximated by [ delta_approx ] |_y|= ( 1+o ( ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - approx ] we show how the approximation becomes better increasing the ellipticity @xmath33 . for example , a maximal relative error of @xmath34 is made for @xmath35 decreasing rapidly to an error of @xmath36 when @xmath37 .",
    "[ ] [ ] @xmath38 [ ] [ ] @xmath39    from eq .",
    "it is possible to see that the `` collision '' is localized in space and time : as the integral converges rapidly , an excellent approximation of  with the condition  consists in taking as upper cutoff of the integral @xmath40 .",
    "this means that most of the change of velocity occurs during the interval of time @xmath41 centered around @xmath42 in our parametrization , in a region of length @xmath43 .    in order to compute simply averages over the velocity pdf in what follows ,",
    "it is useful to have an expression of the change of velocity as a function of the velocity of the particle itself . in the same approximation we have [ v - approx ] |(t=0)|vx_0(1+o ( ) ) .",
    "then [ v_perp ]    of closest approach .",
    "we use the notation @xmath44 because , in this approximation , @xmath45 corresponds to the change of velocity in the perpendicular direction of the velocity of the particle .",
    "this result is the one obtained by chandrasekhar adapted to self - gravitating systems in @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "we will discuss the implications and limitations of this approach in sect .",
    "[ sect - chandra ] .",
    "we compute the diffusion coefficients using the standard method used in @xmath12 in the local approximation . as the spatial density pdf is approximately constant up to a scale @xmath52 in radial coordinates",
    "( see discussion above and numerical simulations of sect .",
    "[ simulations ] ) , we can therefore estimate the number @xmath53 of collisions of a particle in an time interval @xmath54 , on average , as [ coll ] ; the factor @xmath55 is the average height of a circle of radius @xmath52 .",
    "we are going now to average over the velocity pdf .",
    "we will do a somewhat uncontrolled approximation here because eq .",
    "gives the change of relative velocity _ at the point of closest approach_. it is not possible to compute exactly this quantity from the velocity pdf because the change in velocity of a particle does not depend on its velocity ( as in the homogeneous case ) but in the orbit to which it behaves , i.e. , in the particular values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 corresponding to the particle . to go further , however , we will assume that it is possible to average over the velocity pdf @xmath58 .",
    "introducing , as in the @xmath12 case , the rosenbluth potential @xcite @xmath59 and assuming that the velocity pdf is isotropic , we obtain , keeping only terms of @xmath60 ( see app .  [ derivation ] ) : @xmath61 where [ coeff ] c=. as the succession of qss have an approximate polar symmetry , it is then useful to write eq .   in polar coordinates . considering that the rosenbluth potentials are isotropic , we get using eq .",

    "[ vfp - polar ] = c \\{-+ } , where we have defined [ hat_c ] c = c=. equation depends on @xmath5 through @xmath68 , which implies that the relaxation scales as _ coll~n _ dyn . to compute explicitly the diffusion coefficients we need an explicit form of @xmath69 . as discussed above",
    ", the velocity pdf at the distance of closest approach is unknown .",
    "we will use then the standard approximation to take the equilibrium maxwell  boltzmann pdf ( see e.g. @xcite ) [ distri_mb ] s_mb(v)=2v v_*(-v^2 ) , with @xmath70 given by eq .  .",
    "we obtain in this approximation [ coeff - expl - bessel ] @xmath71,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "it is possible to verify that the equilibrium pdf is a stationary solution of eq .   with the diffusion coefficients given by eq .",
    "note that we obtain the same result obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which a different method to compute the diffusion coefficients than rosenbluth potentials has been used .",
    "we compare the theoretical model with molecular dynamics simulations performed with a modification of the publicly available code gadget2 @xcite to handle the logarithmic interaction .",
    "we use a time - step of @xmath73 in order to ensure a very precise energy conservation , which is better than @xmath74 for the whole duration of the runs .",

    "the simulations have been performed for times of @xmath79 for the systems with the largest @xmath5 and @xmath80 with the smallest one . in order to improve statistics , we average the measured velocity pdf over @xmath81 consecutive snapshots in an interval of @xmath82 .",
    "the system forms a qss which is approximately homogeneous in its central region , with a rapid decay of the density at larger scale , as it can be seen in fig .  [ density ] for both initial conditions .",
    "we observe that the one with initial virial ratio @xmath76 gives rise to a compact density pdf whereas the one with initial virial ratio @xmath77 to a core halo distribution .",

    "we observe that for the inner part of the system the potential is very well approximated by the potential generated by the system at thermal equilibrium .",

    "therefore , the change in the velocity is given , following the ito definition , by [ langevin ] dv(t)=c\\{(q(v)+)dt+dw } , where @xmath94 is a gaussian stochastic variable delta correlated in time with variance unity .",
    "we choose as initial condition a configuration of the numerical simulation at @xmath86 ( time in which the system has violently relaxed ) and then we compare the evolution predicted by the langevin equation and the one of the full numerical simulation .",
    "we integrate eq .   by a simple euler procedure . in fig .",

    "the matching between the curves corresponding to different @xmath5 is very good in the region out of equilibrium , as it has been illustrated for @xmath92 , @xmath91 and @xmath90 , which confirm the prediction of eq .   for the scaling of the relaxation .",

    "we emphasize that the difference in the slopes of the curves is essentially due to the different initial conditions considered for each case rather than in the value of @xmath52 taken : taking indeed the same value of @xmath52 for both initial conditions the two curves appear to be very different .",
    "the full simulation curves decay to a lower value at thermal equilibrium because fluctuations appears to be larger in the molecular dynamics simulations than in the langevin simulation .",

    "we show the evolution of the full velocity pdf for both the simulation and the theory .",
    "the first two rows of the figure corresponds to the case @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . in the next two rows of the figure we reproduce the same plots but in log  linear scale to appreciate the tails of the distribution . we observe that the model predicts very well the evolution of the velocity pdf for _ intermediate _ values of the velocities . for low velocities",
    "it predicts systematically a relaxation _ faster _ than the observed in the simulation , whereas for large velocities it predicts systematically a relaxation slower than the one observed in the simulations ( in the latter case specially for the @xmath77 system ) .",
    "we will discuss this discrepancy in the following section .",
    "it is possible to show that the result is the same one than the one obtained in the spatial homogeneous case originally treated by chandrasekhar applied to gravity in @xmath17 . in this study",
    ", it was considered rectilinear trajectories with constant relative velocity @xmath46 ( e.g. @xcite ) , in which the distance of closest approach @xmath57 is the impact factor @xmath102 .",
    "then [ chandra ] |_|2_0^ dt=. the agreement between the results can be understood for two reasons :    1 .",
    "trivially , in the limit @xmath103 , the unperturbed trajectories become rectilinear , and 2 .",
    "an excellent approximation to the integral is obtained taking @xmath104 as upper cutoff , i.e. , the collision is localized in the same sense than the one discussed for the integral of eq .  .",
    "therefore we can conclude , that when the relative orbits have large ellipticity , the system can be treated as locally homogeneous and eq .",
    "would be a good approximation .",
    "we have checked that it is the case in our system , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - elip ] .",
    "[ ] [ ] @xmath38 [ ] [ ] @xmath105 [ ] [ ] @xmath76 [ ] [ ] @xmath77    in this figure , we measure from the simulations the value of @xmath38 for all the possible relative orbits ( i.e. @xmath106 in total ) at @xmath86 .",
    "we stress however that , as discussed above , it is not possible to average properly over velocities : the appropriate velocity pdf which must be used in eqs .   and",
    "is not the velocity pdf but the _ velocity pdf at the moment of the collision_. having this idea in mind we obtain a very coherent picture to explain the results obtained in fig .  [ vel_all_theo ] :    * particles with large velocity are very likely to be at the perigee of their orbit , i.e. , the portion of the orbit in which the velocity is maximal .",
    "hence , during the successive collisions , it is very probable that they would be in another portion of their orbit , with smaller velocity .",
    "therefore , velocities at the moment of the collisions is systematically overestimated and , using eq .",
    "( or eq .  ) , the relaxation rate predicted by the chandrasekhar approximation will be faster than the one which actually happens in the system . *",
    "the opposite occurs for low velocities : particles are more likely to be at the apogee of their orbit .",
    "therefore , the velocity in the moment of the collisions is systematically underestimated , and then , for the same reason than above , the chandrasekhar approximation predicts a relaxation rate slower than the one which actually occurs .",
    "the arguments presented above apply also in @xmath12 , which may explain why the original chandrasekhar approach gives a good estimate of the relaxation time in inhomogeneous systems , taking as maximal impact parameter the size of the system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular :    * we expect that , in the same way than in the case studied here , the mean field potential would not change too much during the collisional relaxation process , which essentially makes the dynamical time @xmath3 invariant .",
    "* it has been shown numerically in @xmath12 that , for a wide set of initial conditions , the qss presents also a central homogeneous region which decays rapidly to zero at larger scales @xcite .",
    "our hypothesis of subsect .",
    "[ mean - field - potential ] would be therefore fulfilled . *",
    "all he arguments of subsect .",
    "[ comp - change - vel ] would also be true , and in particular the change of velocity due to one collision would have the same properties than eq .",
    ", as we will show below .",
    "because collisions occurs also in a plane , we would have now [ delta_vy_3d ] |_y| & & 2 g _ 0^ + & = & . in the limit @xmath103 , and using eq .  , we get the well - known result of chandrasekhar @xcite : [ grav-3d ] |v_| .",
    "collisions are then `` local '' , in the same manner than in the case discussed in the paper , i.e. , the change in velocity occurs in a region of space of order of the impact factor .",
    "analogously than in the case treated in the paper it is difficult to estimate the statistics of the relative velocities at the distance of closest approach .",
    "however , the dependence of the change in velocity with the impact factor is expected to be an excellent approximation . as eq .",
    "factorizes between a part which depends on the velocity and another one on the impact factor @xmath102 , even if we do an error computing averages over velocities we would obtain the coulomb logarithm @xmath107 integrating over the allowed impact factors ( @xmath108 is the minimal impact factor ) .",
    "this explains why the relaxation rate measured in simulations scales with the coulomb logarithm , as observed in simulations in gravitational systems in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that using a `` minimal '' model  based on the chandrasekhar approximation  we can describe well the evolution of the velocity distribution of a gravitational system in @xmath17 , for times from the formation of the qss to thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have derived an explicit kinetic equation neglecting collective effects , in which we slightly adjust a single free parameter @xmath52 . comparing the evolution of the velocity distribution observed in the simulation and the one calculated with the model",
    ", we obtain a good agreement for all times , from the formation of the qss to thermal equilibrium .",
    "we can conclude , as we anticipated in the introduction , that the chandrasekhar ( or local ) approximation gives a reasonable description of the collisional relaxation in this system .",
    "this is due to the fact that many of the relative orbits of the particles which can be well approximated by ellipses which large ellipticity , for which the chandrasekhar approximation is a good one .",
    "however , a systematic error is made computing the diffusion coefficients , because the velocity of the particles _ during the collisions _ does not correspond in general to the velocity of the particle at the moment in which we sample the velocity pdf .",
    "because of that , we have shown that we overestimate systematically the relaxation rate of the particles with small velocity and we underestimate systematically the relaxation rate of particles with large velocities .",
    "we have neglected possible resonances of the particles with the mean field potential .",
    "we expect that they are not important , because particles have the same mass , which is a very different situation of the decay of a single much massive particle inside a qss formed by much lighter ones , which can excite resonances ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the actual potential in which particles are moving is not harmonic but is close to the one of eq .  :",
    "particles present highly precessing quasi - periodic orbits , which are very unlikely to excite resonances by crossing the system again and again following the same trajectory .    on an other side",
    ", we do not observe numerically the scaling @xmath11 observed in @xcite .",
    "this is is due to the fact that they use a simplified dynamics ( polar symmetry is imposed along all the run and therefore particles conserve their initial angular momentum ) appear not to describe properly the collisional dynamics of the real @xmath17 system .",
    "a possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the model presented in @xcite is not truly two - dimensional but quasi one - dimensional .",
    "it is known that one - dimensional models as the hmf can present striking scalings of the relaxation time with @xmath5 , as pointed out in the introduction .",
    "interestingly , however , the same group get , using the same simplified dynamics in @xmath12 , the same scaling @xmath7 observed using full numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "more investigation should be done to understand this discrepancy .",
    "some conclusions can be made about the maximal impact parameter which has to be considered in the calculations . in the simulations we do not observe any dependence of @xmath52",
    " which is directly related with the maximal impact parameters allowed  with the number of particles @xmath5 .",
    "we can conclude then that the maximum impact parameter does not depend on a scale related to the interparticle distance  which scales as @xmath109 but with the size of the system .",
    "moreover , we obtain an actual value of @xmath52 which corresponds to the size of the homogeneous part of the system .",
    "this result is in agreement with simulations performed in @xmath12 dimensions @xcite with potential interactions @xmath110 , @xmath111 , in which the maximal impact parameter to take in the chandrasekhar approximation was numerically estimated to be @xmath112 the size of the system .",
    "we can conclude that to obtain a better description of the collisional relaxation , the use of action ",
    "angle variables is unavoidable . when performing the the calculation of eq .",
    "we are indeed using action ",
    "angle variables , the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 being proportional to the two actions of the system .",
