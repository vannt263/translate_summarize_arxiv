    "we investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of a pair of jets with large and similar transverse momenta produced at a large relative rapidity separation y  @xcite . in principle , when this rapidity y between the most forward and most backward jets is small there is not much phase space for the production of extra radiation and a fixed order perturbative calculation should be enough to describe the observable .",
    "however , if y is large enough to make the product @xmath0 then a bfkl resummation of these terms to all orders should improve the accuracy of the calculation .    in section  [ sec : crosssections ] we define our observables at partonic level and argue that the particular choice of rapidity variable removes the dependence on the parton distribution functions in normalized cross sections .",
    "the explicit expressions for angular differential cross sections including the next  to  leading ( nlo ) bfkl kernel  @xcite with full angular dependence are also presented . in section  [ sec : resummation ] we study in detail the structure of the scale invariant nlo bfkl kernel for different conformal spins .",
    "we show how the convergence of this kernel in terms of asymptotic intercepts is poor for zero conformal spin while being much better for larger ones . after this",
    ", a prescription to improve the collinear structure of the kernel using a shifted anomalous dimension for the full angular dependence is derived . the main consequence of this study is that even though collinear poles are removed for all conformal spins only the asymptotic intercept corresponding to the angular averaged case is modified , while the intercepts of the angular dependent components are hardly affected by the resummation .",
    "in section  [ sec : phenomenology ] we use these kernels to make predictions for hadron colliders .",
    "we further discuss the need of a collinear resummation to generate stable results against a change of renormalization scheme and show that the resummed results provide a better description of the tevatron data than those using lo bfkl .",
    "however , our results provide too much decorrelation when they are compared to the experimental measurements . from the theoretical side",
    "this could be due to the approximations needed to obtain our analytic results , _",
    "e.g. _ , the choice of rapidity variable and use of leading order jet vertices . in principle , our predictions should be more reliable at larger rapidities where multiple emissions between the two tagged jets are favored .",

    "regge kinematics and try to investigate other possible jet topologies dominated by them .",
    "this point is further discussed at the end of our work , in the conclusions section .",
    "we are interested in the study of normalized differential cross sections which turn out to be quite insensitive to the parton distribution functions . therefore , to a good accuracy",
    ", the present analysis can be performed at partonic level and we focus on the @xmath1 process .",
    "the differential cross section is then @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strong coupling , @xmath4 are the transverse momenta of the tagged jets , and y their relative rapidity .",
    "the influence of the distribution functions is larger if the exact definition of the rapidity difference as in fig .",
    "[ mngraph ] is considered . for convenience",
    "we take y as a fixed parameter since this allows us to perform all the necessary mellin transforms and proceed with our analysis analytically . in more detail",
    ", the choice @xmath5 corresponds to a change of the energy scale @xmath6 to a fixed value .",
    "this change can be also understood as a nlo contribution to the vertices coupling the tagged jets to the external hadrons .",
    "the uncertainty associated to the choice of @xmath7 will be taken into account in the phenomenological discussion at the end of section [ sec : phenomenology ] .",
    "the gluon green s function @xmath8 carries the full dependence on y and fulfills the nlo bfkl equation which , in the transverse momenta operator representation @xmath9 with normalization @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11 this representation is useful when it acts on the basis @xmath12 which includes the dependence on the modulus and azimuthal angle of the different emissions .",
    "the mellin ",
    "conjugate variable of the modulus is the real parameter @xmath13 , and the fourier ",
    "conjugate parameter of the angle is the integer conformal spin @xmath14 .    as the rapidity difference increases the azimuthal angle dependence is mainly driven by the kernel",
    "this is the reason why , in the present work , we make use of the lo jet vertices which are much simpler than the nlo ones calculated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can then write the differential cross section in the azimuthal angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the angles corresponding to the two tagged jets , as @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 throughout this work , the coefficients @xmath20 are not evaluated at the saddle point , but obtained by a numerical integration over the full range of @xmath13 . in the above expression the lo kernel , @xmath21 , has as eigenvalue the function @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the logarithmic derivative of the euler gamma function .",

    "it is useful to use the normalized differential cross section on the azimuthal angle : @xmath37 before comparing the results stemming from these expressions with the experimental data it is important to first analyze the convergence of the kernel at nlo for the different conformal spins .",
    "we proceed with this study in the coming section .",

    "@xcite . for the observables studied in this paper",
    "we have found that if we use the nlo bfkl kernel as it stands the cross sections are very dependent on the renormalization scheme . in particular , the term proportional to @xmath38 in @xmath39 can be removed by a shift of the landau pole of the form @xmath40 this defines the so  called gluon  bremsstrahlung ( gb ) scheme  @xcite which is commonly used when dealing with soft gluon resummations . in this new scheme",
    "we find that some of our distributions even change sign and become unphysical .",
    "this is a manifestation of the poor convergence of the series . a crucial ingredient to improve the convergence of the perturbative expansion is to demand compatibility of the bfkl kernel with renormalization group evolution to all orders in the limit of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "this can be achieved if corrections to all orders are introduced by means of a shift in the anomalous dimension  @xcite .",
    "so far these types of resummations have been performed for a bfkl kernel averaged over the azimuthal angle and therefore they only affect the zero conformal spin sector . for our purposes in this work we must study the convergence of the eigenvalues of the kernel for all angular components .",
    "the renormalization group improved kernels are based on a proper treatment of the collinear region of emissions .",
    "this region is insensitive to the azimuthal angle so we should not find a big effect beyond the @xmath33 case when we resum .",
    "we will see that this is the case because the asymptotic intercepts for the different angular components with @xmath41 are very stable under radiative corrections .    to start our investigation",
    "it is necessary to extract the pole structure of the different contributions to the kernel around the @xmath42 points .",
    "these poles are as follows : @xmath43 the coefficients at the singular points can be written as @xmath44 here @xmath45 stands for the harmonic number @xmath46 .    the term due to running coupling effects @xmath47 , in eq .",

    "this gives us confidence on the stability of our calculations . in fig .",

    "in these plots we have not included the term related to the lo impact factors . as a general feature",
    "we see how for non  zero conformal spins the lo and nlo kernels contain poles which are moving away from the @xmath55 region .",
    "these singularities are removed when the collinear resummation , which is indicated as `` shift '' in the plots , is introduced .",
    "we also show how the approximation provided by eq .",

    "the structure for the higher @xmath14 s is the same as for @xmath58 with the poles `` traveling '' towards the left and right directions in @xmath59 . in these plots",
    "we can already see how the region relevant for asymptotic intercepts , around @xmath60 , is only sensitive to the collinear resummation for the angular averaged component , @xmath33 . for the other contributions the intercepts are practically invariant under the introduction of radiative corrections . to highlight this feature",
    "we study the region @xmath61 for small @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ kernelvsnu ] .",
    "we recognize the familiar feature for @xmath33 where the double maxima are replaced by a single one at @xmath62 when the matching to collinear evolution is performed , this removes unphysical oscillations in the gluon green s function  @xcite .",
    "we also see that all the @xmath63 contributions have a single maximum at that point and the resummation only shifts their asymptotic intercepts by a very small amount .",
    "we would like to point out that the only conformal spin with positive asymptotic intercept is @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the dependence on the azimuthal angles in the green s function decreases with energy .",
    "this property remains when the value of the coupling increases as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ kernelvsalphas ] .    after having introduced the resummed kernel used in our calculations",

    "when dealing with mueller  navelet jets we are interested in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions where two jets are tagged in the very forward and very backward regions with similar semihard transverse momenta , @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 . for large rapidity differences between these two jets logarithms of the form",

    "mueller and navelet proposed this process in ref .",
    "@xcite as ideal to apply the bfkl formalism and predicted a power  like rise for the cross section .",
    "however , to realize this growth as a manifestation of multi  regge kinematics is very difficult since it is drastically damped by the behavior of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for @xmath67 .",
    "a possible way out is to fix the pdfs and to vary the center  of  mass energy of the hadron collider itself , and thereby vary the rapidity difference , y , between the two tagged jets .",
    "bfkl predicts a behavior of the cross sections of the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the intercept .",
    "the d@xmath70 collaboration analyzed data taken at the tevatron @xmath71collider from two periods of measurement at different energies @xmath72 and 1800 gev . from these they extracted an intercept of @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "this rise is even faster than that predicted in the lo bfkl calculation which for the kinematics relevant in the d@xmath70 experiment yields an approximated value of 1.45 .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the exact experimental and theoretical definitions of the cross sections disagreed making the interpretation of the results cumbersome , and the fact that the experimental determination of the intercept is based on just two data points leaves room for other possible explanations .    in this work we focus on a more exclusive observable , namely , the azimuthal angle decorrelation between the jets .",
    "we would like to recall that the mueller  navelet jets lie at the interface of collinear factorization and bfkl dynamics .",
    "the partons emitted from the hadrons carry large longitudinal momentum fractions and , after scattering off each other , they produce the two tagged jets . because of the large transverse momentum of these jets , the partons are hard and obey collinear factorization .",
    "in particular , their scale dependence is governed by the dglap evolution equations . between the jets , on the other hand ,",
    "we require a large rapidity difference , a configuration largely dominated by multi ",
    "regge kinematics .",
    "therefore , the hadronic cross section factorizes into two conventional collinear parton distributions convoluted with the partonic cross section , described within the bfkl context . with respect to the partonic cross section ,",
    "the incoming partons , consequently , are considered to be on  shell and collinear to the incident hadrons .    for the angular correlation theoretical predictions from lo bfkl",
    "were first obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , improvements due to the running of the coupling and proper treatment of the kinematics have been implemented in refs .",
    "a first step towards an analytic nlo description has been made in refs .",
    "@xcite on which our work builds up .",
    "ten years ago the d@xmath70 collaboration at the tevatron measured the azimuthal decorrelation between mueller  navelet jets  @xcite . at that time",
    "only the lo bfkl equation was available and predictions based on it failed to describe the data since it estimates too much decorrelation .",
    "meanwhile , an exact fixed nlo @xmath74 monte carlo calculation using the program jetrad  @xcite underestimated the decorrelation .",
    "in contrast , the monte carlo program herwig  @xcite was in perfect agreement with the data .",
    "the main target of our present work is try to improve the prediction for this observable using the bfkl resummation introducing nlo effects in the kernel .",
    "we now show the effect of these new terms for the different observables related to the azimuthal angle dependence . as mentioned before",
    ", the convenient choice of the rapidity variable @xmath75 turns the convolution with the effective parton distributions into a simple global factor which cancels whenever we study ratios of cross sections or coefficients @xmath76 . for such observables ,",
    "the hadronic level calculation does therefore not differ from the partonic one in this approximation .",
    "we start by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron1 ] the tevatron data for the average of the azimuthal angle between the two tagged mueller  navelet jets , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and compare them with our resummed prediction developed in the previous section using eq .",
