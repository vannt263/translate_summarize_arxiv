    "an understanding of the origin , properties and evolution of our galaxy requires a careful census of its constituents , in particular its stellar members",
    ". of special importance are the intrinsic physical properties of these stars .",
    "the fundamental properties are mass , age and abundances , as these determine a star s history and future development .",
    "however , ages are not observable , and masses can only be directly obtained from some multiple systems .",
    "thus we must indirectly gain this information via the stellar spectrum , and a number of atmospheric parameters have been defined for this purpose .",
    "the main ones are the effective temperature , , the surface gravity , , and the metallicity , .",
    "to these can also be added the alpha abundances ,  ( which measure the devations away from the ` standard ' abundance ratios ) , the photospheric microturbulence velocity , , and the extinction by the interstellar medium , ( although not intrinsic to the star , it is necessary for determining its luminosity ) . masses and ages can then be determined from stellar structure and evolution models and with calibration via binary systems .",
    "it is important to realise that this modelling is complex , and a number of assumptions have to be made .",
    "there is , therefore , a limit to the precision with which we can determine physical properties .",
    "historically , spectroscopic parameters have been measured indirectly through the mk classification system ( morgan et al .",
    "@xcite ) or via colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams . in the mk system ,",
    "the two parameters _ spectral type _ and _ luminosity class _ act as proxies for  and . originally a qualitative system relying on a visual match between observed spectra and a system of standards , much progress has been made in quantifying it with automated techniques ( e.g.  weaver & torres - dodgen @xcite ; bailer - jones et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the most commonly used classification techniques have been neural networks and @xmath4 matching to templates ( or more generally , minimum distance methods ) .",
    "a summary of recent progress in this area is given by von hippel & bailer - jones ( @xcite ) .    despite this focus on the mk system ,",
    "it is not well suited to classifying data from the deep surveys which will be central to the future development of galactic astrophysics .",
    "this is for a number of reasons , but in particular because it lacks a measure of metallicity .",
    "although mk does make allowance for various ` peculiar ' stars , these are defined as exceptions , and the notation is not suited to a statistical , quantifiable analysis .",
    "this is problematic given the significance of metal poor halo stars in a deep survey .",
    "there is also now no good reason why we should not determine physical parameters directly from the observational data .",
    "some attempts have been made to determine the physical parameters of real spectra directly by training neural networks on synthetic spectra .",
    "gulati et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used this approach to determine the effective temperatures of ten solar metallicity g and k dwarfs .",
    "taking the `` true '' effective temperature of these stars as those given by gray & corbally @xcite , they found a mean `` error '' in the network - assigned temperatures of 125k .",
    "bailer - jones et al .",
    "( @xcite ) determined  for over 5000 dwarfs and giants in the range b5k5 , and also showed evidence of sensitivity of the parametrization models to metallicity .",
    "the accuracy with which physical parameters can be determined from a stellar spectrum depends upon , amongst other things , the wavelength coverage , spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . from the point of view of designing a stellar survey project",
    "it is essential to know how well the stellar parameters can be determined for a given set of these observational parameters .",
    "moreover , given that there is always a limit to the collecting area and integration time available , there is always a trade - off between spectral resolution , sensitivity and sky coverage .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the accuracy with which physical stellar parameters can be determined from spectroscopic data at a range of snrs and resolutions which could realistically be achieved in a _ deep _ survey mission .",
    "this specification rules out high resolution spectra .",
    "the parametrization work has been carried out using neural networks ( sect .",
    "[ networks ] ) because they have been shown to be one of the best approaches for this kind of work .",
    "this is not to presuppose , however , that some other approach may not ultimately be better .",
    "the simulations have been made using a large database of synthetic spectra generated from kurucz atmospheric models ( sect .",
    "[ synspec ] ) .",
    "while these spectra do not show the full range of variation in real stellar spectra , they are adequate for a realistic demonstration of what is possible as a function of snr and resolution .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] and summarised and discussed in sect .  [ discussion ] . finally , the requirements for a complete survey - oriented classification system are given in sect .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "the simulations in this paper were partially inspired by the need to produce an optimal photometric / spectroscopic system for the gaia galactic survey mission .",
    "gaia is a candidate for the esa cornerstone 5 mission for launch in 2009 ( esa , in preparation ) .",
    "it is primarily an astrometric mission with a precision of a few microarcseconds , and will survey the entire sky down to v=20 , thus observing c.  10@xmath5 stars in our galaxy .",
    "radial velocities will be obtained on board down to v=17.5 , thus providing a 6d phase space survey ( three spatial and three velocity co - ordinates ) for stars brighter than this limit .",
    "a survey of this size will have a profound impact on galactic astrophysics , but to achieve this it is essential that the physical characteristics of the target objects are measured and correlated with their spatial and kinematic properties . as gaia is a continuously scanning satellite , a fixed total amount of integration time is available for each object , so there is a trade - off between resolution , signal - to - noise ratio and wavelength coverage . for various reasons , the current gaia design does not include a spectrograph ( other than a 1.5  resolution region between 8470 and 8700  intended for radial velocity measurements ) , but instead will image all objects in several medium and broad band filters ( table  [ filttab ] ) .",
    "three filter systems are shown : the system nominally selected for the mission plus two alternatives .",
    "the profiles of the two alternatives are represented as gaussians in this paper .",
    "the ability of these filter system to determine stellar parameters will be compared with that for spectra of various resolutions .",
    ".three multiband filter systems proposed for the gaia mission .",
    "all profiles are symmetric about the central wavelength , @xmath6 , and have a fwhm of @xmath7 .",
    "the profiles of the filters in the asiago and modified strmvil systems ( f.  favata 1999 , private communication ) are defined as gaussians ( although note that the former is only an approximation to the original asiago system in munari @xcite ) .",
    "the filters of the selected gaia system ( esa , in preparation ) have flatter tops and steeper sides than gaussians , and have defined relative peak transmissions , t. there is some ( intended ) redundancy within each filter system . [ cols=\"^,>,^,>,^,>,^ \" , ]     the results of the parametrization process are shown in figs  [ results1][results3 ] and tabulated in tables  [ restab1][restab3 ] . before interpreting these results we should consider the limits which the data themselves place on the performance .",
    "first , the network will be unable to produce errors smaller than the smallest variations in the data set .",
    "if , to take a hypothetical example , the spectra did not change as the metallicity changed by 1.0 dex , we could not expect the network to determine  to much better than 0.5 dex .",
    "second , the grid of atmospheric models represents the physical parameters at a finite sampling , e.g.  a constant step size of 0.5 dex for .",
    "this sampling does not in itself limit the precision achievable ; it is perfectly possible for the network to legitimately give an error much smaller than the sampling because the network is minimising a continuous error function and not just obtaining the best match between a spectrum and a set of templates . nonetheless , the network input ",
    "output mapping is an _ interpolation _ of the training data , and the more coarsely sampled the parameter grid the harder it is for the network to get a reliable interpolation .",
    "consequently , while the network _ may _ be able to achieve sub - sampling accuracy , we should not be surprised if it can not .",
    "thus to avoid over - interpreting these results we should not compare two errors which are both smaller than half the sampling level .",
    "the _ average _ ` half - sampling ' values for  and  are 0.2 and 0.25 respectively , and for log  in the three temperature ranges ( cool , intermediate and hot ) are 0.01 , 0.01 and 0.03 respectively .",
    "the implication is that , if the network produces errors smaller than these half - sampling values ( as it does ) , we can not know whether the performance is limited by the network model or by the data themselves .",
    "a distinction will only be possible with a more sensitive and finely sampled grid of atmospheric models .    with the above caveat taken into account , i draw attention to some interesting features in figs  [ results1][results3 ] .    1 .",
    "good  determination is possible with all resolutions / filter systems and snrs .",
    "the larger error in  above 10000k may be an artifact of the larger half - sampling value in this region ( @xmath81000k ) .",
    "2 .   only at high resolution can  be determined for the coolest stars and even then the determination is poor relative to the hotter stars .",
    "this is understandable , at least in part , because the spectral signature is primarily in the line widths which are only apparent at high resolution .",
    "although the three filter systems differ somewhat , they give essentially the same performance as each other .",
    "the filter systems ( each with 1015 input parameters ) have similar  and  as the @xmath9=400  spectra ( 35 inputs ) .",
    "5 .   at low snr , the @xmath9=400  spectra and the filters give poor  and very poor  determination for all three temperature ranges .",
    "6 .   at high snr",
    "( 1000 ) all resolutions / filter systems appear to be equally good at determining any of the parameters .",
    "differences will probably become apparent with a more sensitive training grid .",
    "7 .   at higher temperatures the accuracy is more sensitive to snr than at lower temperatures . 8 .",
    "metallicity determination is more difficult at higher temperatures , especially for the filters and low resolution spectra .",
    "this is understandable as at high temperature there are fewer and weaker metal lines which are only significant at high snr and/or resolution .",
    "9 .   in most cases",
    "there is little difference between the performances of the @xmath9=25 , 50 and 100  spectra , at least for this data grid .",
    "the results demonstrate that a fully automated neural network can accurately determine the three principal physical parameters from spectroscopic or photometric stellar data , something which has not previously been demonstrated .",
    "moreover , this work has used spectra of considerably lower resolution than have been used before in automated classifiers . even at low resolution ( 50100  fwhm ) and",
    "snr ( 510 per resolution element ) , neural networks can yield good determinations of  and , and even for  for stars earlier than solar .",
    "still lower resolutions permit good results provided the snr is high enough ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "that good  can be achieved even at low resolution and snr is perhaps not surprising when we consider that the spectra have absolute fluxes , which will be the case with high precision parallax missions such as gaia .",
    "however , the more distant objects will have lower precision parallaxes and hence errors in the _ mean _ flux level . but even if we completely ignore distance information ( and flux normalise the spectra ) , the shape of the spectrum is still a strong indicator of : for example , bailer - jones et al .  ( @xcite ) obtained an mk spectral type precision of 0.8 subtypes ( @xmath10=0.0100.015 ) across a wide range of spectral types ( b2m7 ) using flux normalised spectra .",
    "this is similar to what can be achieved from broad band photometry , implying that  determination only requires very low resolution .",
    "the good performance of ` high ' resolution spectroscopy ( 25 ) at very low snr ( @xmath11 per pixel ) was not expected .",
    "it seems to imply that for a given amount of integration time it may be better to sacrifice snr for resolution .",
    "it is noteworthy that while the filters provide good , their ability to determine  and especially  is very limited at low snr .",
    "how do these results compare with classical parametrization methods ?",
    "gray ( @xcite ) compiles results showing that with photometric errors below 0.01 magnitudes , the b@xmath0v colour calibrates  to 23% ( 4% for hotter stars ) in the absence of reddening .",
    "slightly better precision can be obtained from the slope of the paschen continuum and size of the balmer discontinuity .",
    "the latter may also be used to measure  to @xmath2 dex . with spectra at a few   resolution over a similar wavelength range to that used here , cacciari et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained uncertainties in log  and  of 0.01 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "sinnerstad ( @xcite ) made uvby,@xmath12 photometric measurements of b stars , and for uncertainties of 0.005 in @xmath12 and of 0.01 in u@xmath0b ( i.e.  snr @xmath13 200 ) , infers errors in log  and of 0.004 and 0.08 respectively .",
    "these are similar to or slightly better than the results for similar stars in tables  [ restab1][restab3 ] ( @xmath14 ) at the highest resolutions .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath15 )  spectra have generally been used to determine metallicity , and in a review , cayrel de strobel ( @xcite ) notes that metallicity can be determined to @xmath16 dex at snr=250 ( but only @xmath2 dex at snr=50 ) provided the effective temperature and gravity are approximately known . at lower snr ( 1020 ) , jones et al.(@xcite ) could determine [ fe / h ] to @xmath2 dex for g stars using a set of spectroscopic indices measured at 1  resolution in the range 40005000 , again using a known effective temperature .",
    "more recently , katz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have used a minimum distance method to parametrize spectra by finding the closest matching template spectrum .",
    "the template grid consisted of 211 flux calibrated spectra ( 39006800 , @xmath17 ) with 4000k@xmath18@xmath186300k , @xmath19[fe / h]@xmath20 , and  for dwarfs and giants .",
    "the _ internal accuracy _ of the method for log  ,  and  was 0.008 , 0.28 dex , and 0.16 dex respectively at snr=100 , and 0.009 , 0.29 dex and 0.17 dex at snr=10 .",
    "as expected , their results for  are much better than those in this paper at the similar temperature range ( @xmath21 in table  [ restab2 ] ) , presumably due to their much higher resolution . in contrast",
    ", their performance for  is similar and for  somewhat worse than that in this paper at 500 times lower resolution .",
    "their results also confirm that at high resolution a lower snr leads to very little loss in performance .",
    "snider et al.(@xcite ) trained and tested neural networks on a set of 182 real f , g and k spectra over the range 36304890  at intermediate resolution ( @xmath131 ) , and achieved 1@xmath22 errors in log  ,  and  of 0.015 , 0.41 dex and 0.22 dex respectively , based on training and testing a network with a set of 182 real f , g and k spectra .    when judging the relative values of the different resolution / snr combinations in this paper , we must also take account of their implementation ` costs ' , specifically the relative integration times required . usually for a survey",
    ", a fixed total amount of integration time is available for all filters / spectra . in the case of gaia",
    " which is continuously rotating ",
    "a star moves across a focal plane covered with a mosaic of ccds which are clocked at the rotation rate .",
    "the different filters are fixed to different ccds , so that as a star moves across the mosaic it is recorded in different wavelength ranges .",
    "thus less numerous and/or broader filters would achieve a higher snr than more or narrower filters .",
    "some filters could be replaced with a slitless spectrograph ( e.g.  a prism or grism ) .",
    "this disperses every point on the sky and thus gives the full integration time for all wavelengths , but at the expense of increased sky noise and object confusion .",
    "these could be reduced by using one or more dichroics to redirect the light to two or more focal planes .",
    "( confusion would be reduced further with gaia by the fact that each area of sky is observed at many different position angles over the mission life . )",
    "an alternative approach is a set of many medium band filters ( @xmath23 for @xmath9=100  over the complete wavelength range , although omission of some filters could be achieved ) . while this avoids the two principal disadvantages of the slitless spectrograph , the integration time per wavelength interval",
    "is dramatically reduced .",
    "the development of a complete parametrization system will require further research , much of which needs to be directed at taking better account of the true nature of the observational data .",
    "directions and suggestions for the course of this work are now given .",
    "essentially all of the work in the literature on automated classification deals with preselected objects .",
    "in contrast , an unpointed survey will pick up a whole range of objects , necessitating a filtering system to select the stars .",
    "such a system could make use of both object morphology and spectral features , and systems based on neural networks ( e.g.  odewahn et al .",
    "@xcite ; miller & coe @xcite ; serra - ricart et al .",
    "@xcite ) and principal components analysis ( bailer - jones et al.@xcite ) have been proposed .",
    "such a system must be relatively robust and always allow for ` unknown ' objects which can be dealt with manually .",
    "it will be necessary to have a stellar database for training which takes better account of the larger range of variation present in the galactic stellar population .",
    "ideally , a large set of real spectra across a wide range of physical parameters should be obtained for this purpose .",
    "good atmospheric models and synthetic spectra are nonetheless still required for determining their physical parameters and thus for training the network .",
    "there are two possible approaches to training .",
    "the first is to train on synthetic spectra suitably preprocessed to be in the same form as the observed spectra ( e.g.  bailer - jones et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the alternative is to obtain a representative sample of real spectra with the survey system , calibrate them , and then use them to train a network . in theory",
    "the latter method gives a better sampling of the true cosmic variance in the spectra , but of course requires that a representative sample is selected from the survey data .",
    "this sample could be improved as the survey progressed .",
    "neural networks are fast to train and apply , so it is realistic to expect that even for a database of @xmath24 objects the network could be retrained and applied to the whole database in less than a day .",
    "more advanced model atmospheres are required for a number of reasons :    1 .   ,  and  do not uniquely describe a true spectrum .",
    "models sensitive to different abundance ratios and which include chromospheres ( for example ) are necessary .",
    "kurucz models assume lte which is known to break down in a number of regimes ( e.g.  for very hot stars ) .",
    "3 .   both the atmospheric models and the line lists lack water opacity , known to be important for cool stars , thus setting the current lower  limit of about 4000k .",
    "yet more advanced models ( which include dust ) are required for very cool stars ( l and t dwarfs ) and brown dwarfs , of which many will be found by gaia .      of particular importance is insterstellar extinction ( reddening ) , especially in deep surveys .",
    "the extinction can , in theory , be determined by the network by training it on artificially reddened synthetic spectra and providing the network with a `` reddening '' output parameter ( or parameters ) .",
    "this has been demonstrated on limited data sets by weaver & torres - dodgen @xcite and gulati , gupta & singh @xcite , who determined e(b@xmath0v ) to within 0.05 and 0.08 magnitudes respectively .",
    "the latter made use of 6  resolution uv spectra ( 48505380 ) .",
    "the former used red spectra ( 58008900 ) at 15  resolution and found that the spectral type and luminosity class classifications did not degrade much as reddening was added .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the parametrizations in this paper will be robust to reddening , particularly as the spectra have a much larger wavelength coverage .",
    "the filter systems proposed for gaia were of course designed with interstellar extinction in mind , and a study of its impact has been carried out ( esa , in preparation ) .",
    "this work shows that suitable q parameters ( non - linear combinations of the filter fluxes ) used to determine the physical parameters are largely insensitive to reddening .",
    "it also claims that narrow band filters are not necessary for overcoming reddening . in some parts of the parameter space ,",
    "reddening is more problematic ( e.g.  for k stars ) , largely due to a degeneracy between it and  and .",
    "however , at intermediate and high galactic latitudes it is expected that e(b@xmath0v ) can be determined to within 0.002 magnitudes .",
    "munari ( @xcite ) similarly shows that reddening - free indices exist for the asiago filter system .",
    "as a neural network also forms non - linear combinations of the filter fluxes , it is reasonable to suppose that it too will be robust to redenning , although this will be the subject of future work .",
    "the parametrization model used in a real survey must confront the fact that most stars are in spatially unresolved multiple systems .",
    "independent measurement of the physical properties of each component is desirable and in principle achievable  when the brightness ratio is large enough  by training the network with composite spectra . in this case",
    "the network model would need to have multiple sets of outputs to deal with each component .",
    "an alternative approach is to use ` probabilistic outputs ' in which the single output for , say , , is replaced with a series of outputs in which each value of  ( 6000 , 6250 , 6500 etc . )",
    "is represented separately .",
    "the network then evaluates the probability that each temperature is present in the input spectrum .",
    "this method is not recommended , however , as it eliminates the intrinsically continuous nature of the physical parameters .",
    "it would also greatly increase the number of outputs and hence the number of free parameters ( weights ) in the network .",
    "object confusion should not result in any overlapped spectrum being rejected entirely .",
    "rather , it would be better to have a parametrization model which is robust to missing data .",
    "this is a major challenge for the feedforward network models used in this and most other papers on automated classification , and will presumably require some transformation of the input spectrum .",
    "an analysis of the effect of wavelength coverage on the parameter determination accuracy is important because a smaller spectral coverage ( or _ coverages _  it need not be contiguous ) would also reduce this confusion .",
    "finally , the model should make use of all available data . in the case of gaia",
    ", this means including the data from the high resolution spectrograph ( 84708700  at 0.75 )  used to measure radial velocities .",
    "as the inputs to the network need not be homogenous , there should be no problem incorporating different types of data .",
    "i would like to thank fabio favata , gerry gilmore and michael perryman for useful discussions on this work , in particular within the context of the gaia mission .",
    "i am also grateful to robert kurucz for use of his model atmospheres and compiled line lists , and to richard gray for the use of his synthetic spectra generation program ."
