    "the rs cvn binary system class is loosely defined as consisting of a chromospherically active evolved star orbiting within a few days around a main - sequence or subgiant companion ( hall 1976 ) .",
    "their short rotation period implies high levels of activity ( e.g. , noyes et al . 1984 ) , observed as strong emission of chromospheric lines and saturated x - ray emission ( dempsey et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray spectra of the brightest and nearby rs cvn binary systems obtained by _ xmm - newton _ are well - exposed and provide a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "abundant coronal elements ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni ) produce a rich spectrum of electronic transitions in the euv and x - rays , allowing us to perform benchmark studies of atomic databases .",
    "recent results with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ show that models reproduce the observed spectra fairly well ( e.g. , audard et al .",
    "2001a , behar , cottam , & kahn 2001 ) , although a significant number of lines , mainly from si , s , ar , and ca l - shell lines , are either absent in the atomic databases or are not properly reproduced ( audard et al .",
    "in this study , we have therefore discarded wavelength ranges where such lines dominate in order not to bias the convergence of the spectral fits , and especially to get more accurate elemental abundances .",
    "past stellar coronal abundance determinations have been done with ccd spectra of moderate spectral resolution ( e.g. , drake 1996 , gdel et al .",
    "1999 ) or with low sensitivity spectrometers ( e.g. , drake , laming , & widing 1995 , laming , drake , & widing 1996 , schmitt et al .",
    "1996 , drake , laming , & widing 1997 ) .",
    "abundance studies of stellar coronae are a powerful means to better understand the well - studied , but still puzzling , abundance pattern in the sun : in brief , the solar corona and the solar wind display a so - called `` first ionization potential '' ( fip ) effect , for which the current consensus is that the abundances of low - fip ( @xmath0  ev ) elements are _ enhanced _ relative to their respective photospheric abundance , while the abundances of high - fip ( @xmath1  ev ) elements are photospheric ( e.g. , haisch , saba , & meyer 1996 ) .",
    "stellar coronal spectra often showed a metal abundance deficiency relative to the _ solar _ photospheric abundances ( schmitt et al .",
    "1996 ) , with fe / fe@xmath2 in active rs cvn binary systems . more detailed studies with _ euve _ showed either the absence of any fip - related bias ( drake et al . 1995 ) , or the presence of a fip effect in inactive stellar coronae ( drake et al .",
    "1997 ) . the current generation of x - ray observatories , _ xmm - newton _ and",
    "_ chandra _ , combine high spectral resolution with moderate effective areas to routinely obtain excellent data to measure abundances in stellar coronae .",
    "an analysis of a deep exposure of the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum ( brinkman et al . 2001 ) of the rs cvn binary system hr  1099 showed a trend towards enhanced high - fip elemental abundances ( normalized to o and relative to the solar photospheric abundances , anders & grevesse 1989 ) , while low - fip elemental abundances were depleted ; this effect was dubbed the `` inverse fip '' effect .",
    "different active stars also show such a trend ( gdel et al .",
    "2001ab ) , while the intermediately active binary capella displays neither a fip nor an ifip effect ( audard et al .",
    "it is practice to normalize stellar coronal abundances to the _ solar _ photospheric abundances , while they should better be normalized to the _ stellar _ photospheric abundances .",
    "the latter are , however , hard to measure due to enhanced chromospheric activity , high rotation rate and the presence of spots in active stars , particularly in rs cvn binaries",
    ". nevertheless , for some stars , photospheric abundances are known .",
    "gdel et al .",
    "( 2002 ; also in these proceedings ) discuss the transition from an inverse fip effect to a `` normal '' fip effect in the long - term coronal evolution from active to inactive solar analogs ; all targets have photospheric abundances indistinguishable from those of the sun , which suggests that the observed transition is real .",
    "while low - fip elements appear underabundant in the quiescent state , a notable increase of the abundances of `` metals '' during flares is often observed ( e.g. , ottmann & schmitt 1996 , favata et al . 2000 ) .",
    "more precisely , time - dependent spectroscopy of a large flare in ux ari ( gdel et al . 1999 ) showed that low - fip elements increased more significantly than the high - fip elements .",
    "a recent high - resolution x - ray spectroscopic study of a flare in hr  1099 with _ xmm - newton _ showed a similar behavior ( audard , gdel , & mewe 2001b ) .",
    "in this `` electronic '' paper , we present a study of abundances in rs cvn binary systems observed by _ xmm - newton_. in brief , it shows i ) a transition from an inverse fip effect to an absence of a fip bias with decreasing activity , compatible with a similar transition observed in solar analogs ( gdel et al .",

    "and , and capella binned at 500  s. epic mos2 light curves are shown , except for capella where the sum of the rgs1 first and second order light curves is given , due to substantial pile - up and optical contamination of the epic data .",
    "note that the epic count rate for hr  1099 is smaller as we had to use an annulus extraction region to account for pile - up in the central part of the psf .",

    "the rgs1 , rgs2 , and epic mos2 spectra ( except for capella where no epic data are available ) were fitted simultaneously in xspec 11.0.1aj ( arnaud 1996 ) with the ` vapec ` model .",
    "we have removed significant parts of the rgs spectra above 20     to take into account the incompleteness and inaccuracy of the atomic database for non - fe l - shell transitions .",
    "additionally , some fe l - shell lines with inaccurate atomic data were not fitted .",
    "a free multiplicative constant model has been introduced for cross - calibration uncertainties , finite extraction region and , in the case of hr  1099 , an annulus - shaped extraction region .",

    "we used the solar photospheric abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , except for the fe abundance which was taken from grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) .",
    "the panels are ordered in decreasing activity from top to bottom .",
    "clearly , ratios for high - fip elements exceed the ratios for low - fip elements in very active stars ( hr  1099 , ux ari ) , while for the less active , not tidally locked @xmath3 and , a poor correlation is observed . in the intermediately active capella ,",
    "no fip bias is present although a possible weak fip effect could be suggested .",
    "however , any bias is definitive only if coronal abundances of stars are compared to their respective photospheric abundances rather than to the solar values .",

    "such a procedure needs to be applied to stars that do show a clear ifip bias when normalized to solar photospheric values .",
    "new accurate measurements of photospheric abundances in these objects are timely .",
    "the `` average '' temperature of a stellar corona is an indicator of activity that is defined here as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the 10-t model temperatures and emission measures , respectively .",
    "we present samples of the abundance ratios relative to o ( for the low - fip fe and the high - fip ne ) as a function of @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "data points from solar analogs ( gdel et al .",
    "2002 ; in these proceedings ) have been added ; the panels show a very different behavior : while the fe / o ratios exponentially decrease with increasing temperature , the ne / o ratios show no correlation with the average coronal temperature .",
