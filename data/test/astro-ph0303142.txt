    "although polar ring galaxies constitute only a small fraction of the galaxy population , these objects are interesting because they offer a unique insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "for example , understanding the kinematics of polar rings could ultimately reveal the three - dimensional shape of their dark matter halos ( whitmore , mcelroy , & schweizer 1987 ; sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; combes & arnaboldi 1996 )",
    ". they may also provide information on mergers of galaxies . the conventional model for polar ring formation ( schweizer , whitmore , & rubin  1983 ; schechter , ulrick , & boksenberg  1984 ) attributes ring formation to gas",
    "capture after the central galaxy has formed .",
    "bekki  ( 1998 ) has suggested a different model in which a polar ring galaxy is formed in a dissipative polar merger of two comparable mass disk galaxies with small relative velocity .",
    "recently , tremaine & yu ( 2000 ) have offered an alternative model for polar ring formation that requires no accretion or merger .",
    "if a galaxy lies in a symmetry plane of a triaxial dark halo with an initially retrograde pattern speed that slowly tends to zero ( e.g. , as the halo acquires dark matter by infall ) , disk stars are trapped at a resonance when the rate of precession of a slightly tilted orbit matches the pattern speed of the triaxial halo .",
    "as the resonance slowly sweeps outward past the stars , they are levitated into polar orbits .",
    "the model predicts that a polar ring formed in this way will contain two equal mass , counterrotating disk streams .",
    "note that , if the halo pattern speed were to increase through zero to prograde , the stellar orbits could become retrograde in the disk , and form a counterrotating disk stream .",
    "thus , the tremaine & yu ( 2000 ) model provides an interesting mechanism that can explain both polar ring and counterrotating _ disk _ galaxies without a merger ( see also evans & collett 1994 ) . because in the resonance levitation model the polar ring contains counterrotating stellar populations , whereas in merger models the ring stars would most likely be rotating in one direction , the stellar kinematics of a polar ring provide a means to discriminate between these formation scenarios .",
    "a prime candidate for the measurement of the stellar velocities in a polar ring is ngc  4650a .",
    "it consists of a central s0 galaxy , surrounded by a prominent polar ring . with an adopted local group centric velocity of v@xmath0=2635 km s@xmath1 , and a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , ngc",
    "4650a is at a distance of 38  mpc . at this distance , @xmath2=184 pc . because of its relative proximity , ngc",
    "4650a has been extensively studied ( see e.g. , gallagher et al.2002 and references therein ) .",
    "observations at 21-cm ( arnaboldi et al .  1997 ) revealed a spatially extended  disk coincident with the ring , leading these authors to suggest that ngc 4650a is more appropriately called a polar disk galaxy ( see also wakamatsu 1993 ) .",
    "recent observations taken with the hubble space telescope as part of the heritage project reveal a complex , warped structure of the polar disk ( gallagher et al .  2002 ; iodice et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in this letter , we report stellar and gas velocities in both the s0 and the ring of ngc 4650a .",
    "we believe that these are the first measurement of _ stellar _ velocities in a polar ring .",
    "our observations support the identification of the ring as a disk , but we continue to call it a ring , to avoid confusion with the s0 disk .",
    "we have obtained spectra of the s0 and of the ring of ngc 4650a with the boller and chivens spectrograph and the marconi ccd at the las campanas baade ( 6.5-m ) telescope .",
    "for all observations , the slit width was @xmath2 and the slit length @xmath3 . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , the data were binned on - chip by 4 @xmath4 pixels in the spatial direction .",
    "the spectral coverage was 1600 , with a fwhm resolution of 135 km s@xmath1 ( 0.78   pix@xmath1 ) .",
    "observational details are provided in table  [ tabobspar ] . after each science exposure",
    "an argon wavelength calibration and an offset sky exposure were taken . at the beginning and end of each night template stars with spectral types in the range g8iii to k4iii",
    "were observed .    the choice of slit position merits special mention .",
    "because of the warp of the ring , a single slit position can not cover both    table [ tabobspar ] + to    llllr date & spectral & integration & position & region + & region & time & angle & + 2001 may 29 & & 1800s & 155 & n ring + 2001 may 30 & & 1800s & 150 & s ring + 2002 apr 6 & mg & 12 x 1800s & 335 & n ring + 2002 apr 7 & mg & 7 x 1800s & 63 & s0 major + 2002 apr 7 & mg & 4 x 1800s & 335 & s ring +    the center of the s0 galaxy and the brightest regions of the n and s part of the ring . to maximize the signal from the polar ring , we chose to align the slits along the brightest parts of the ring .",
    "as a result , the ring slit positions are each displaced about @xmath5 from the nucleus of the s0 galaxy .",
    "for the major axis spectrum of the s0 galaxy , a position angle of 63@xmath6 was adopted ( whitmore et al.1990 ) .",
    "the positions and orientations of the slit for each of these pointings are indicated in fig .",
    "[ figslitpos ] .    during an earlier observing run with the baade 6.5 m telescope",
    ", we obtained h@xmath7 emission line spectra of the n and s parts of the ring ( table  [ tabobspar ] ) .",
    "the slit positions for these spectra were close to those for the 2002 observations indicated in fig .",
    "[ figslitpos ] .",
    "the frames were bias subtracted , flat fielded , cleaned of cosmic ray events , wavelength calibrated and combined in iraf .",
    "sky subtraction was done by combining all offset sky images for the appropriate slit position and subtracting it , after scaling , from the corresponding science frame .      to determine the stellar kinematics ,",
    "the underlying stellar continuum emission was first subtracted from both the galaxy and the template star frames .",
    "next , these continuum subtracted frames were cross correlated by swaters to obtain the stellar line - of - sight ( los ) velocities .",
    "the absorption velocities were determined by fitting gaussian profiles to the cross - correlation peaks ( ccp ) , every @xmath2 where the signal was strong ( along almost the entire length of the s0 major axis slit position , and within @xmath8 of the s0 major axis for the ring slit positions ) . at other locations",
    ", the data were binned in @xmath5 intervals .",
    "the calculated errors of the derived velocities are the quadratic sum of the formal errors on the cross correlation and the dispersion resulting from using different template stars .",
    "example ccps are shown in the top four panels of fig .",
    "[ figccs ] .",
    "the typical width of the cross - correlation peaks is about 230 .",
    "the reduction process was not optimized to measure the stellar dispersions .",
    "the wavelength range of these observations also contains the [ oiii ] 5007 , 4959 , and h@xmath9 emission lines .",
    "emission line velocities were measured by rubin using the customized dtm measuring program in the software package vista ( rubin , hunter , and ford 1990 ) .",
    "the argon frames for each slit position were used for wavelength calibration . only the [ oiii ] 5007 line was measured because the spectrum degraded rapidly toward the blue and the h@xmath9 emission was located in a fairly deep absorption trough .",
    "the 2001 spectra were measured by rubin using the same procedures as for the [ oiii ] line , except that the night sky emission lines on each frame were used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "in fig .  [ figstellarkin ]",
    "we plot the los velocities of the polar ring stars as a function of their distances from the major axis of the s0 , 0 .",
    "note that @xmath10 corresponds to the location where the slit crosses the major axis , rather than the distance from the nucleus . with the exception of the region within @xmath11 of the s0 major axis ,",
    "the stellar velocities along the ring resemble those expected for a normal , late - type disk galaxy .    a notable feature in fig .  [ figstellarkin ]",
    "is the apparently double valued velocities in the central regions .",
    "we attribute these to the combination of the strong contribution of light from the s0 that overwhelms the contribution from the ring stars , and the slit positions that are offset by @xmath5 from the s0 center .",
    "the radial velocities at these positions along the s0 major axis ( see fig .",
    "[ figs0 ] ) are indicated in fig .",
    "[ figstellarkin ] by the arrows , and match well the velocities observed in the ring spectra .",
    "the observations reveal no evidence for equally populated counterrotating stellar streams in the polar ring . with a velocity difference close to 200 km s@xmath1 between the approaching and    -0.3 cm    receding sides of the ring , the spectral resolution is sufficient to detect two equal mass components .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figccs]e , which shows the ccp for a model equal mass , counterrotating stream , constructed by coadding the n and s spectra .",
    "this model ccp , with its width of 350 , is significantly wider than the observed ccps .",
    "note also that the model ccp peaks near the systemic velocity , as expected for two equal , counterrotation streams .",
    "thus , merely the fact that we observe significant rotation in the ring rules against the existence of two equal mass counterrotating streams .",
    "however , we can not rule out the existence of a weaker , counterrotating component , whose absorption features would be lost in our instrumental resolution and sensitivity . from analysis of models constructed by adding the n spectrum to a scaled down s spectrum",
    ", we estimate that at most about 15% of the stars can be in counterrotation .",
    "a comparison of the measured los stellar and [ oiii ] ionized gas velocities in the ring shows that the velocities of the stars and the gas in the polar ring agree closely ( see fig .",
    "[ figcompring ] ) .",
    "note how well the gas velocities bisect the double valued stellar velocities , indicating that the emission line gas is associated with the ring , not the s0 .",
    "we attribute the double valued gas velocities , @xmath12 , to the different regions sampled by the n and s ring spectra in the region north of the s0 major axis ( fig .",
    "[ figslitpos ] ) .",
    "the measured h@xmath7 velocities are virtually indistinguishable from the [ oiii ] velocities ( fig .",
    "[ figcompring ] ) ; differences are probably due to minor differences in the slit positions .",
    "calculating the stellar and emission line rotation curves from the observed radial velocities requires corrections for inclination , slit position , asymmetric drift , and los integration effects .",
    "the inclination correction is complex because of the warped nature of the ring ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ; gallagher et al .",
    "however , outside of @xmath13 the main part of the polar ring appears close to edge - on ( gallagher et al .  2002 ) , and there the inclination corrections are negligible .",
    "the correction for the off - center position of the slit is 7% at @xmath14 , and less for larger @xmath15 .",
    "the correction for asymmetric drift depends on the velocity dispersion and the shape of the velocity ellipsoid , and their dependence on radius ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 198 ) . in principle",
    "these can be derived from the data presented here , but this is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we    -0.3 cm    note that the asymmetric drift correction is largest just outside the galaxy center , and gets smaller with radius .",
    "a final correction is needed is because the spectra are integrated along the los , but these corrections are small compared to the corrections for asymmetric drift ( sackett & sparke 1990 ) . because the corrections are complex or uncertain , we have not derived the stellar rotation curve for the polar ring . however , given that the corrections are small , or get smaller with larger @xmath16 , the flatness of the rotation curve is a secure result .",
    "the agreement between the stellar and emission line kinematics seems remarkable given that gas and stars are expected to have different corrections for asymmetric drift and los integration .",
    "however , after convolution with the spectral resolution , any narrow spectral features are washed out , resulting in observed stellar and emission line profiles that have similar shapes and derived los velocities .",
    "los stellar velocities along the equatorial plane of the s0 ( fig .",
    "[ figs0 ] ) , show a smooth rotation curve ( @xmath17 = 3.6 kpc ) with los velocities approaching 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "emission lines of [ oiii ] and h@xmath9 are observed within @xmath18 of the nucleus .",
    "their los velocities , close to the ngc  4650a systemic velocity , independent of radius , suggest that we are probably observing the ionized gas component of the polar ring .",
    "in this letter we report the first detection of stellar velocities in the ring of polar ring galaxy ngc  4650a . to our knowledge , these are the first stellar velocities obtained for a polar ring .",
    "the kinematics reveal well - defined rotation , both in gas and in stars .",
    "the rotation curve appears to reach a flat part for @xmath19 .",
    "the original impetus for this work was to look for evidence for two equal mass , counterrotating streams to test the intriguing polar ring formation model proposed by the tremaine & yu ( 2000 ) . however , the fact that we detect well - defined rotation , and the structure of the ccps , rule out a polar ring that consists of two equal mass counterrotating streams . nonetheless , given the sensitivity and resolution of our observations , we can not rule out that a small fraction ( @xmath20% ) of the stars is counterrotating .",
    "thus , it appears that the tremaine & yu ( 2000 ) resonance levitation mechanism is not at work in ngc  4650a .",
    "however , as tremaine & yu ( 2000 ) point out , the self - gravity of the ring ( likely for ngc 4650a given its luminous mass is similar to that of the s0 , iodice et al .",
    "2002 ) makes it energetically favorable for all stars to be a single stream , rather than two counterrotating streams .",
    "another complication is the uncertain effect of the presence of dust and gas in the polar ring of ngc  4650a on resonance capture .",
    "furthermore , because the resonance levitation model predicts that the polar material does not extend to the galaxy center , the possibility that ngc  4650a has a polar disk that does ( iodice et al .",
    "2002 ; see also below ) makes it less likely it has formed through resonance levitation .",
    "perhaps galaxies with narrow polar rings that have little or no gas and dust , or disk galaxies with counterrotating streams are more likely to have formed through resonance levitation .",
    "absent evidence for a resonance levitation mechanism for the formation of the polar ring in ngc 4650a , we briefly consider the merger or acquisition alternatives .",
    "the observed flatness of the rotation velocities in the polar gas and polar stars offers strong kinematic evidence that this feature is a spatially extended disk rather than a narrow ring , as suggested earlier from gas kinematics ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ) and from morphology ( gallagher et al .",
    "insight into the radial extent of the      polar ring is offered by the emission line kinematics along the major axis of the s0 .",
    "these velocities , constant at the systemic velocity , most likely arise from polar ring gas . with the inner ring warped with an inclination of  63@xmath6 ( gallagher et al .",
    "2002 ) , the emission lines seen at the center indicate that ring gas extends into the center .",
    "the emission likely arises in the chaotic dust lanes which are oriented at random and extend into the s0 nucleus ( gallagher et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "iodice et al .  (",
    "2002 ) argue that the luminous mass in the ring is similar to or even higher than that of the s0 .",
    "its large luminous mass , combined with its disklike morphology , suggest the polar ring in ngc 4650a is a disk galaxy that is the victim of a dissipational polar merger of disks of approximately similar masses ( bekki 1998 ) .",
    "further support for a merger scenario comes from the location of ngc 4650a in a chain of galaxies in the centaurus cluster ( sersic 1968 ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that a single accretion event could transfer the required large mass , or that extended accretion over a period of time could produce sufficient coherence to form a ring .",
    "although we did not detect counterrotating star streams in the polar ring of ngc 4650a , which would have been more exciting , we are continuing the study of this fascinating object .",
    "we postpone a detailed kinematic model until we have more extensive observations .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "maxine singer , who , as president of the carnegie institution of washington , insured that the two - magellan telescope project proceeded , and the astronomers and technical staff who insured that it succeeded ."
