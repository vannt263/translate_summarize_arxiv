    "classical be ( or b - emission ) stars are rapidly rotating , hot stars with optical spectra that show hydrogen emission lines , and , frequently , emission lines from singly ionized metals .",
    "it has been recognized since the days of @xcite that recombination in a flattened disk of circumstellar gas can reproduce the basic features of the spectroscopically observed h@xmath3 line profiles of be stars .",
    "however , it is now generally accepted that this model is too simplistic .",
    "the detailed mechanism(s ) that creates and maintains be star disks remains unclear @xcite , although rapid rotation of the central b star certainly plays a role @xcite .",
    "in addition to this lack of a successful dynamical model , the evolutionary status of be stars and related stars ( such as b[e ] stars ) is not well understood , and possible evolutionary connections between these groups are ambiguous .",
    "these problems are compounded by the additional uncertainty in their rotation rates @xcite and lack of understanding of how rotation and evolution interplay .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite that the rotation rates of be stars may be systematically underestimated , combined with new interferometric data , has rekindled interest in finding suitable dynamical models for these stars .    until recently",
    ", the bulk of the observational evidence for the presence of disks surrounding be stars has been spectroscopic and polarimetric in nature .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence includes the profiles of the emission lines observed in the optical and ir spectra , as well as continuum excesses at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the net linear polarization observed in be stars arises via electron scattering in the non - spherical distribution of gas , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , interferometric observations that spatially resolve the disks in several wavelength regimes are becoming available , ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interferometric observations , in concert with other observables , allow the disk physical properties to be determined with greater accuracy and this may contribute to the development of more successful dynamical models .    @xcite collected long - baseline , optical , interferometric observations of the classical be stars @xmath4cas and @xmath5per at the navy prototype optical interferometer ( npoi ) and interpreted these observations using simple models of the intensity distribution on the sky , such as uniform disks , rings , or disks with a gaussian intensity distribution . in this paper , we extend the work of @xcite by computing detailed theoretical models for the intensity distribution on the sky produced by the central b star and disk of a be system .",
    "we then compare these models to observations collected at the npoi .",
    "the theoretical models are computed with the bedisk code developed by @xcite . assuming a density distribution of the disk gas",
    ", the code can compute the temperatures in the disk given the energy input from the central stars photoionizing radiation field , by enforcing radiative equilibrium . as the disk density model contains several adjustable parameters , values for these parameters",
    "can then be extracted from the match to observations .",
    "we present new observations and detailed models for the be stars @xmath6dra , @xmath7psc , and @xmath8cyg .",
    "we also use near - contemporaneous observations of the h@xmath3 spectral lines for these stars as additional constraints on the density model . as we shall demonstrate , the additional spectroscopic constraint of detailed line profiles is often an important ingredient in selecting among models consistent with the interferometric observations .",
    "the overall goal of this study is to place tight constraints on physical conditions in the circumstellar regions of these be stars .",
    "the theoretical disk models presented in this investigation were constructed using the bedisk code developed by @xcite . a brief overview of the code and assumptions relevant to this work are presented below .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "the circumstellar disk is assumed to be axi - symmetric about the star s rotation axis and symmetric about the mid - plane of the disk . in this case , cylindrical geometry is appropriate and we use @xmath9 for the radial distance from the star s rotation axis and @xmath10 for the height above the equatorial plane .",
    "the radial density distribution in the equatorial plane is assumed to be given by an @xmath11 power - law following the works of @xcite . at each radial distance from the rotation axis , the vertical structure of the disk",
    "is determined by the requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath10 direction which balances the @xmath10 component of the star s gravitational acceleration with the gradient of the gas pressure .",
    "typical values for the radial power - law index @xmath12 for theoretical models of be stars usually fall in the range of 2 to 3.5 based on models that fit the ir continuum @xcite .",
    "models with the highest values of @xmath12 have a faster decrease in the density distribution with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the density distribution within the disk is determined by an assumed value of the density at the stellar surface in the equatorial plane , @xmath13 , by the power - law index , @xmath12 , and by the assumption of pressure support perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath12 significantly affect the theoretical predictions , we conduct a 2-dimensional parameter search by varying these input parameters over all reasonable values for comparison with interferometric and spectroscopic observations .    given this density model , the bedisk code is used to find the temperature structure of the disk by enforcing radiative equilibrium .",
    "the microscopic heating and cooling rates implied by a gas with a solar chemical composition are computed and the temperature that balances heating and cooling is found . to compute the atomic level populations required by this procedure ,",
    "the statistical equilibrium equations are solved for each chemical element included , accounting for the bound - bound and bound - free collisional and radiative processes that set the rates in and out of each atomic level .    to compute the hydrogen line profiles , we solved the transfer equation along a series of rays through the star plus disk system as viewed at an angle @xmath14 relative to the line - of - sight ( where @xmath15 is pole - on , and @xmath16 is equator - on ) .",
    "the disk is assumed to be in pure keplerian rotation , and the equatorial rotational velocity of the star was chosen so that the measured @xmath17 of the star was recovered for the adopted value of @xmath14 . for rays terminating on the stellar surface , we adopted a photospheric h@xmath3 line profile computed using the synthe code and the stark broadening routines of @xcite ; these profiles are based on the hydrogen populations computed for the appropriate lte , line - blanketed model atmosphere adopted from @xcite . for rays passing through the disk , the equation of radiative",
    "transfer was solved along the ray using the short - characteristics method of @xcite . to compute the h@xmath3 opacity and emissivity ,",
    "the hydrogen level populations computed for the thermal solution were used . here , hydrogen was represented by a 15 level atom and all implied radiative and collisional bound - bound and bound - free processes from and between the 15 levels were included .",
    "the radiative bound - bound rates were treated by the escape probability approximation in which the net radiative bracket for the line @xcite is replaced by a single - flight escape probability . while the escape probability approximation can provide a reasonable description of the line thermalization ,",
    "the use of escape probabilities is an important approximation .",
    "the bedisk code assumes static escape probabilities based on the complete redistribution over a doppler profile for all lines ( for a justification of this procedure see * ? ? ?",
    "if the functional form of the escape probability function is changed , for example , to a simple @xmath18 dependence on optical depth for @xmath19 , the predicted equivalent width of h@xmath3 can change by @xmath20 @xmath21 ( due to the change in the thermal structure of the disk and in the hydrogen level populations ) .",
    "thus in matching to the observed h@xmath3 profiles , the largest uncertainty is likely from the uncertainty in the theoretical profile and not from the observational uncertainties ( see section 3 for an estimate of the observational uncertainties ) .",
    "our approach allows the full dependence of the h@xmath3 line emissivity and opacity on the physical conditions throughout the disk to be retained .",
    "the stark broadening routines of @xcite were also used to compute the local h@xmath3 line profile throughout the disk .",
    "this is important as these routines can handle high disk densities for which the assumption of a simple gaussian or voigt profile for the h@xmath3 line would be invalid .",
    "the final h@xmath3 line profile from the unresolved system was obtained by summing over the rays weighted by their projected area on the sky .",
    "the h@xmath3 line profile was computed over a wavelength bin of @xmath22  from line centre at each area element on the sky . to obtain the final h@xmath3 line profile to compare with spectroscopic observations ,",
    "the profile was convolved with a gaussian of fwhm of @xmath23  to bring the resolving power of the computed profile down to @xmath24 to match the observations .",
    "the predicted interferometric visibilities also followed from the same numerical model .",
    "the monochromatic h@xmath3 image of the system projected on the plane of the sky was computed by integrating the stellar continuum and h@xmath3 line flux over a 150 @xmath21 spectral window centered at h@xmath3 to represent the interferometric spectral channels ( see section 3 ) .",
    "thus the calculation of the h@xmath3 profiles and the h@xmath3 interferometric visibilities used the same model calculations .",
    "we obtained long - baseline interferometric and spectroscopic observations of three be stars , @xmath0  dra , @xmath1  psc , and @xmath2  cyg .",
    "the interferometric observations were acquired using the navy prototype optical interferometer  ( npoi ) utilizing baselines ranging from 18.9 to 64.4  m in length .",
    "the npoi is described in detail in @xcite and the technique used to extract interferometric observables from the spectral channel containing the h@xmath3 emission line has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "table  [ obs_table ] shows all the interferometric observations obtained for the three stars and the number of data points obtained on each night in the spectral channel containing the h@xmath3 line .",
    "the interferometric observations of all stars were obtained over a period of less than a month , with @xmath1  psc and @xmath2  cyg observed during 2005 , and @xmath0  dra observed during 2006 .",
    "to complement our interferometric observations we have also obtained near contemporaneous spectroscopic observations of all three targets .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained using an echelle spectrograph at the lowell observatory s john .",
    "s. hall telescope and covered the spectral region around the h@xmath3 line .",
    "the properties of the spectrograph and the description of the reduction methods have been described elsewhere  ( see   3.2 in * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ". the continuum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) near h@xmath3 is more than 200 in the spectra of all three stars .",
    "however , the equivalent width and the shape of the line is determined with respect to the normalized continuum level . because the line profile must be normalized by a smoothly varying function that is fit to the continuum ( or where one thinks the continuum is located ) ,",
    "the choice of this normalizing function affects the shape of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "in addition , the presence of telluric lines , as well as their temporal variability from night to night ( and season to season ) can affect how well the continuum level is determined ; we expect this to be the dominant source of uncertainty associated with the shape of the observed h@xmath3 line .",
    "we have estimated the magnitude of this effect by analyzing a set of reduced spectra all obtained from the same raw spectrum , but all obtained with slightly different quadratic functions fitted to slightly different continuum regions .",
    "the variations in the resulting normalized continuum were at the 2 to 3% level , and to be conservative we adopt a 3% uncertainty for our continuum level determination and , in turn , the shape and equivalent width measure of the observed h@xmath3 emission line .",
    "for @xmath1  psc and @xmath2  cyg the spectra were obtained on 2005  sep  16 , and for @xmath0  dra the spectrum was obtained on 2006  mar  17 , and therefore in all three cases the spectroscopic observations overlapped the interferometric observing runs  ( table  [ obs_table ] ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the observed h@xmath3 spectra lines are -15.3  , -24.8  , and -22.2 @xmath21 for @xmath1  psc , @xmath2  cyg , and @xmath0  dra , respectively .",

    "there is considerable uncertainty in the assigned spectral types for be stars due to rapid rotation and spectral variability .",
    "the effects of gravity darkening , and the potential obscuration of portions of the stellar surface by the disk , further compound the uncertainty in classification and the corresponding stellar parameters .",
    "since the stellar parameters fix the photoionizing radiation field that is assumed to be the sole source of energy input into the circumstellar disk , realistic stellar parameters are essential to the construction of reasonable disk models . for each of the stars in this study , we searched the literature in order to find the most reasonable stellar parameters available .",
    "see table  [ stellar_param ] for the adopted stellar parameters for @xmath0 dra , @xmath1 psc , and @xmath2 cyg .",

    "it is variable on a variety of timescales ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion of these variations .",
    "@xcite modeled the central star of @xmath0 dra by comparing a variety of spectroscopic and photometric observations to a grid of non - lte models .",
    "we have adopted their derived best - fit stellar parameters for our study .",
    "we used their parameters of @xmath26 , log@xmath30 , and mass to calculate the stellar radius .",
    "@xcite also used these parameters for the interpretation of @xmath31-band observations of @xmath6dra collected at the chara array interferometer .",
    "the parameters of @xcite are also in reasonable agreement with stellar parameters listed for the spectral class of b5iii in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ kd_grid ] shows the density parameter grid for the disk of @xmath6dra .",
    "this grid was selected after running a series of models over a much wider range in @xmath32 and @xmath12 on a coarser grid . a comparison of the observed and predicted h@xmath3 equivalent widths allowed us to determine a finer grid to sample for detailed comparisons with interferometric observations .",
    "the final density parameter grid consisted of 278 models .",
    "we have compared the output from each model to the interferometric observations using the technique described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the reduced @xmath33 values corresponding to these models are presented in figure  [ kd_chi2 ] as a function of @xmath32 ( g/@xmath34 ) and @xmath12 .",

    "signs correspond to models with the lowest values ( ranging from 1.18 to 1.29 ) of the interferometric reduced @xmath36 . in total , there are 25 models with reduced @xmath35 for this star , therefore , it is necessary to further constrain our models in order to determine the best - fit model .",
    "figure  [ halpha_2d ] shows the predicted h@xmath3 equivalent widths as a function of @xmath37 , and the power - law index , @xmath12 , for the entire grid of models .",
    "the predicted h@xmath3 profiles were constructed assuming an inclination of @xmath38 .",
    "we note that this value of @xmath14 is consistent with other values determined from spectroscopy and polarization analyzes presented in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite , estimates @xmath39 based on the observed polarization angle , and @xcite find @xmath40 based on spectroscopy .",
    "we also experimented by varying @xmath14 and found that an inclination angle for this system of @xmath41 seemed to produce profiles that matched the observed h@xmath3 line .",
    "we also note that although changing the value of @xmath14 by @xmath29 @xmath42 changes the shape of the h@xmath3 profile , the effect on the equivalent width is @xmath43  .",
    "the lightest coloured symbols are closest to the value of the observed equivalent width of -22.2 ",
    ". there are 14 models that predict an h@xmath3 equivalent width within @xmath44 @xmath21 of the observation and these are represented by white circles .",
    "models which correspond to predicted h@xmath3 equivalent widths greater than the observed emission have a plus sign within the corresponding symbol in figure  [ halpha_2d ] .    we note that this subset of 14 models does not represent the 14 best models using interferometry alone .",
    "although this set matches the observed h@xmath3 equivalent width within @xmath29 2  , using interferometric observations as a constraint this same set corresponds to reduced @xmath33 from 1.18 ( the minimum value ) up to 16.0 .",
    "in fact , 6 of the 14 models in this set had a reduced @xmath33 greater than 2.0 .",
    "it is clear from a comparison of figure  [ kd_chi2 ] and figure  [ halpha_2d ] that the results from h@xmath3 interferometry and h@xmath3 line profile are complimentary but that each provides extra information to help reduce the degeneracy in finding the best - fit model .",
    "multiple models , of pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath32 , that produce h@xmath3 profiles with equivalent widths that match the observations within uncertainties can be found . however , not all of these are the best - fits in terms of interferometry .",
    "that is , it is possible to match the equivalent width for a range of @xmath12 by an appropriate adjustment in @xmath32 , but that these combinations do not necessary have the correct density distribution as a function of radial distance from the star .",
    "however , by combining results from spectroscopy and interferometry , we can find the best pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath32 for @xmath0 dra .",
    "next , we compared the subset of 8 models which represent the best - fits from both interferometry and h@xmath3 equivalent width . a subset (",
    "4 models with the lowest reduced @xmath33 from interferometry ) of the corresponding h@xmath3 profiles is shown in figure  [ halpha_dra ] .",
    "notice the variation in the shape of the profile as @xmath12 is increased from 2.7 in the left - most panel to 4.2 in the right - most panel .",
    "the predicted equivalent widths are -21.9 , -23.5 , -22.4 , and -20.3  , with the corresponding @xmath33 values from interferometry of 1.18 , 1.29 , 1.18 , and 1.18 . the model with @xmath45",
    "does not have the the correct line profile shape compared to the observed profile .",
    "there is too much absorption at line centre , and the profile is clearly too narrow in the wings .",
    "all of the predicted profiles in figure  [ halpha_dra ] have an absorption feature at line centre .",
    "this feature is the most pronounced for low values of @xmath12 and gradually decreases for models with higher values of @xmath12 .",
    "if we increase the inclination , this absorption feature becomes more and more pronounced as the system is viewed closer and closer to edge on .",
    "if we decrease @xmath14 , so the system is viewed close to pole - on , the absorption feature remains for the models with the lowest values of @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , with @xmath45 , the wings of the predicted profile are not broad enough for any reasonable values of @xmath14 .",
    "the panel with the model corresponding to @xmath46 and @xmath47 in figure  [ halpha_dra ] shows that the predicted line is too strong and this results in an h@xmath3 equivalent width which is too large .",
    "models corresponding to @xmath48 have profiles with wings wider than the observation .",
    "the model that corresponds to the profile with @xmath49 matches the shape of the observed profile best and has a minimum reduced @xmath33 of 1.18 from interferometry .",
    "we prefer this model with @xmath49 and @xmath50 g/@xmath34 in terms of both spectroscopy and interferometry .",
    "figure  [ fig_dra_fits ] shows the interferometric observations compared with this model for @xmath0 dra .    we note that as previously discussed the uncertainty due to the approximations in the computational code ( see section 2 ) are larger than those in the observed h@xmath3 profiles ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we searched the literature to find the best possible stellar parameters for the disk systems studied in this investigation ( see section 4.1 , 4.2 , 4.3 ) .",
    "however , generally for be stars , not only are the stellar parameters not well established but for some stars , even the spectral type may not be accurate .",
    "we now wish to test the dependence of model parameters on our results .",
    "we experimented by varying the stellar parameters in turn , to see how these changes affect the predicted h@xmath3 equivalent widths and the interferometric fits for the star @xmath0 dra .",
    "similar types of uncertainties would be expected for the other two systems presented in this paper .",
    "one might expect that the @xmath26 of the central star , which supplies the disk with energy , may be the source of the greatest uncertainty .",
    "we changed the @xmath26 by @xmath29 1000 @xmath51 and reproduced all of the profiles .",
    "this resulted in a change in the equivalent width of the h@xmath3 line by a maximum of @xmath52 2  . to assess the effect of uncertainties in the fundamental stellar parameters combined",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation in which new stellar parameters were randomly realized .",
    "these parameters were used to compute a new circumstellar disk model , corresponding to our preferred model of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this procedure was repeated to generate new h@xmath3 profiles and equivalent widths .",
    "errors assumed for the stellar parameters were @xmath55% in mass , @xmath55% in radius , and @xmath56% in @xmath26 ( corresponding to @xmath57k ) ; each stellar parameter was assumed equally probable within its errors . using a gaussian distribution for the errors",
    ", we found our results did not change significantly .",
    "the mean of h@xmath3 equivalent width was @xmath58  with a standard deviation of @xmath59 .",
    "we have one star in common with the work of @xcite : @xmath60dra .",
    "they use a disk density model which is very similar to ours and derive two sets of parameters @xmath61 based on fits to k-band interferometric visibilities : @xmath62 , @xmath63 for a single star model , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 for a binary model .",
    "@xcite prefer the binary fit to the single star model because of the peculiar solution they obtain in the single star case ; namely a very small exponent in the radial density power law ( @xmath66 ) and a best solution with @xmath67 which is at odds with the resolved h@xmath3 line profile .",
    "nevertheless , the particular properties of the introduced binary are not constrained by any independent observations .",
    "both of these solutions seem at odds with our results . it is well documented that the h@xmath3 equivalent width and the infrared excess are correlated ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite present a figure which shows the change in h@xmath3 equivalent width from the early 1970 s to 2004 for @xmath0 dra ( see @xcite , figure 4(d ) ) .",
    "although there is certainly scatter of data values in their figure , one can easily see from this figure that the h@xmath3 equivalent width varies by @xmath52 15 @xmath21 ( from about - 5 to about -20  ) in a period of @xmath52 6 years .",
    "this is a substantial change in the h@xmath3 emission line and we expect there would be a corresponding increase in the infrared excess .",
    "the interferometric observations for @xmath0 dra presented in @xcite were obtained in april ( 3 dates ) and december ( 2 dates ) of 2005 .",
    "their spectroscopic observations were obtained in april 2005 .",
    "our contemporaneous observations were obtained in 2006 .",
    "the difference in our results and @xcite is partially accounted for by the fact that we model this variable star at different times .",
    "this further supports the requirement of contemporaneous observations .",
    "other possible causes for the difference in results could be due the fact that the h@xmath3 observations are sensitive to different regions within the disk as well as the different spatial resolution of the two interferometers .",
    "there are also other differences between our calculations and @xcite that should be highlighted : as noted in section  2 , the calculation of the h@xmath3 visibilities and the h@xmath3 line profiles in our work are obtained from essentially the same calculation that determined the radiative equilibrium temperature structure for the disk given the adopted density model . the h@xmath3 opacity and emissivity at each point in the disk were computed from the local temperature , pressure , and radiative field by solving the set of statistical equilibrium equations for a 15-level hydrogen atom . while our fits to the observed h@xmath3 line profiles are not perfect , they are predicted naturally from the models and the assumption of pure keplerian rotation by the disk . to fit the h@xmath3 , h@xmath68 , and br@xmath3 lines",
    ", @xcite found it necessary to convolve their profiles with a unit normalized lorentzian to broaden the line wings ; they discuss numerous possible sources for this extra broadening . in the current work , we convolved our line profiles only with a unit normalized gaussian of fwhm of @xmath69  to bring the resolving power of the computed profile to @xmath24 to match the observations .",
    "among the reasons cited by @xcite as to possible broad h@xmath3 wings , they discuss the possibility of stark broadening for the hydrogen lines , but then note that the densities they find are too low for stark broadening to be important .",
    "this is consistent with their best fit densities which are about 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes smaller than those derived here .",
    "previous studies have shown that self - consistent disk thermal structures are crucial in order to interpret observations correctly ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we computed the thermal structure for @xmath0 dra with our bedisk code using the model parameters , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , r@xmath70 , listed in @xcite .",
    "we find substantial variation in disk temperature near the star and equatorial plane , and an overall average disk temperature of @xmath52 13000 k. @xcite adopt an isothermal disk temperature of @xmath52 9300 k for @xmath0 dra based on previous studies @xcite , but we note that this study as well as @xcite do not investigate the disk densities as low as the @xcite best - fit model . finally , we note that the value , @xmath49 , we obtain for @xmath0 dra is in agreement with typical values previously predicted in the literature for be star disks ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "this star is similar in spectral type to @xmath0 dra , but it is a main sequence dwarf . we have included @xmath1 psc in this investigation because comparing the disk models with the interferometric observations lead to unique density parameters , and it is useful to compare the results for this star with @xmath0 dra .",
