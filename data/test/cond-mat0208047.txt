    "transverse collective oscillations have been recently excited in the radial plane of an elongated cylindrically symmetric condensate @xcite .",
    "they are quasi-2d excitations and indeed , at very low temperatures , the measured frequencies of the transverse monopole and quadrupole modes are found to be in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained by linearizing the gross - pitaevskii equation for a trapped two - dimensional ( 2d ) system .",
    "moreover , it has been experimentally found that the transverse breathing mode of an elongated condensate exhibits unique features .",
    "first , the excitation frequency is close to twice the radial trapping frequency , it is almost independent of the strength of the two - body interaction and the number of particles , and it is nearly independent of temperature . and second , the transverse breathing mode has a very small damping rate compared to other modes .",
    "the measured damping rate of the transverse quadrupole mode is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the one of the transverse breathing mode .",
    "this is in contrast to the 3d case , where both monopole and quadrupole modes have similar decay rates .",
    "these striking properties experimentally found for the transverse breathing mode are in agreement with the unique features predicted for the breathing mode in 2d isotropic condensates @xcite : its frequency is a universal quantity and it is an undamped mode .",
    "one can conclude that these features are characteristic of the reduced dimensionality thus , providing a demonstration of the two - dimensional nature of the transverse oscillations of an elongated condensate .",
    "therefore , a highly anisotropic cigar - shaped trap can be considered as a first approximation as an infinite cylinder along the @xmath0-direction .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a cylindrical condensate and calculate at zero temperature the transverse spectrum of excitations , by solving the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation in 2d , and the modes with non - zero momentum @xmath1 along the longitudinal axis , as well .",
    "the main purpose is to investigate the coupling between quasi-2d ( transverse ) collective oscillations and thermal excitations in the collisionless regime .",
    "we study the landau damping as a decay mechanism of transverse collective modes as a function of temperature , in which a transverse collective oscillation is annihilated in a collision with a thermal excitation to give rise to another excitation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the transverse spectrum of excitations of a cylindrical condensate by solving the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation in 2d within the bogoliubov theory .",
    "we obtain also the modes with non - zero @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly recall the perturbation theory for the interaction between collective modes of a condensate and thermal excitations ( developed in ref .",
    "we apply this theory to calculate the decay rate due to landau damping of a transverse oscillation . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the main results for the transverse quadrupole mode .",
    "the situation with the singular transverse breathing mode is also discussed .",
    "at low temperature , the elementary excitations of a trapped weakly interacting degenerate bose gas are described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the order parameter : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interaction coupling constant , fixed by the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the atomic mass and the order parameter is normalized to the number of atoms in the condensate @xmath7 .",
    "the confining potential is usually cylindrically symmetric and it is given by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio between axial ( @xmath10 ) and radial ( @xmath11 ) trapping frequencies defines the anisotropy parameter of the trap @xmath12 .",
    "experimentally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transverse modes have been excited in the radial plane of a highly anisotropic cigar - shaped trap , with @xmath13 .",

    "we assume a cylindrical condensate with large longitudinal size @xmath18 compared to the radial size @xmath19 , and with a number of atoms per unit length @xmath20 .    at low temperatures , the dynamics of the condensate",

    "the transverse excitations of a highly elongated condensate can be obtained by neglecting oscillations along the longitudinal direction and thus , looking for fluctuations in the transverse plane of the form @xcite @xmath27 where we have used cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "transverse excitations are quasi-2d modes . to calculate landau damping we must also consider thermal excitations having a quasi - continuous spectrum at @xmath29 with the finite longitudinal wave vector @xmath1 along @xmath0 direction . to study these modes we look for solutions that correspond to propagating waves of the form @xcite @xmath30    inserting ( [ fluctuation ] ) , ( [ deltapsi ] ) and ( [ deltapsilong ] ) in eq .",

    "the modes of the condensate are labeled by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of nodes in the radial solution , @xmath43 is the @xmath0-projection of the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath1 is the longitudinal wave vector .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 are discrete ( @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) whereas @xmath1 for highly elongated condensates ( @xmath46 ) is a real number , and thus , it is a continuous index .",

    "( [ coupled1 ] ) and ( [ coupled2 ] ) , that levels with @xmath47 or @xmath48 are exactly degenerated .",

    "( [ coupled1 ] ) and ( [ coupled2 ] ) that the state with ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 corresponds to the transverse breathing mode with excitation frequency equal to @xmath53 , and that it is independent of the strength of the two - body interaction potential and the number of particles .",
    "of course , according to the universal nature of this mode noted above , this general result is also valid in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit , where the dispersion relation can be found analytically@xcite .",
    "however , the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 for this mode do not coincide in general with their thomas - fermi limit .    the state with ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath52 is a transverse quadrupole mode whose frequency depends on the two - body interaction , ranging from the tf value @xmath55 , valid for large condensates ( @xmath56 or equivalently @xmath57 ) , to the noninteracting value @xmath53 .",

    "we use the numerical solutions to calculate the landau damping of collective modes .",

    "it is worth stressing that the independence of the interaction of the transverse monopole mode , is a unique property of 2d systems , related to the presence of a hidden symmetry of the problem described by the two - dimensional lorentz group so(2,1 ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider a collective mode with frequency @xmath61 , and the excited states @xmath62 available by thermal activation , with energies @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "suppose that this collective mode has been excited and , therefore , the condensate oscillates with the corresponding frequency @xmath61 .",
    "due to interaction effects , the thermal cloud of excitations can either absorb or emit quanta of this mode producing a damping of the collective oscillation .",

    "it means that the excitation energies at a given @xmath100 can be obtained within bogoliubov theory at @xmath101 normalizing the number of condensate atoms to the corresponding condensate fraction at that temperature and assuming that they are thermally occupied with the bose factor .    in order to present numerical results",

    "and then , calculate the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "we have restricted our calculations to levels with energy @xmath114 .",
    "the contribution of higher excited levels can be neglected since their occupation becomes negligible in the range of temperatures we have considered .",
    "it is worth recalling that the dipole mode is undamped @xcite since it is not affected by two - body interactions .",
    "we have checked that within our formalism the landau damping of the transverse dipole mode is zero , as expected .",

    "for such a mode , the functions @xmath118 and @xmath87 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath119 and have also angular dependence ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ matrixel ] ) it follows the selection rules corresponding to transverse quadrupole - like transitions : @xmath121 and @xmath122 . only the energy levels ( @xmath62 ) that satisfy these conditions can be coupled by the interaction .",
    "the integration of the radial part has to be done numerically .    fixed the number of condensate atoms , we have calculated the landau damping for the transverse quadrupole mode as a function of temperature . at zero temperature",
    "we have obtained the excitation spectrum within bogoliubov theory .",
    "we have found that there are @xmath123 pairs of levels that verify the transverse quadrupole selection rules and the energy condition ( [ selection ] ) at finite wave vectors , i.e. , at @xmath124 .",
    "we have calculated the matrix element @xmath88 for each allowed transition , and then , the corresponding damping strength @xmath125 at a given @xmath100 .",
    "summing up the damping strengths for all transitions , we have obtained the damping rate for the transverse quadrupole oscillation , due to the coupling with thermal excitations .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the damping rate versus @xmath126 for the transverse quadrupole mode for a fixed number of condensate atoms per unit length in a cylindrical trap .",
    "as expected , landau damping increases with temperature since the number of excitations available at thermal equilibrium is larger when @xmath100 increases .",
    "one can distinguish two different regimes , one at very low @xmath100 ( @xmath127 ) and the other at higher @xmath128 where damping is linear with temperature .",
    "however , this linear behaviour appears at relatively small temperature ( @xmath129 ) in comparison to the homogeneous system @xcite where this regime occurs at @xmath130 . for the highly elongated condensate of ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been measured at @xmath131 a quality factor @xcite for the transverse quadrupole mode @xmath132 which gives a damping rate @xmath133 .",
    "this value is in agreement with our calculations of the landau damping for this mode ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a more quantitative comparison is not possible at present due to the absence of detailed measurements of the damping of this mode .",
    "however , it is reasonable to conclude that the transverse quadrupole mode in elongated condensates decays via landau damping .",
    "it is worth noting that the order of magnitude of the damping rate of the transverse quadrupole mode is the same as the one previously estimated for a uniform gas @xcite , for spherical traps @xcite and for anisotropic traps @xcite as well .",
    "the landau damping for other modes can be calculated analogously . however , the physical situation for the decay of the singular transverse monopole mode turns out to be much more complicated .",
    "formally the calculations can be committed in the same way .",
    "the quantum numbers for this mode are @xmath52 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the functions @xmath136 and @xmath87 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath137 , and the matrix element @xmath88 couples only energy levels ( @xmath138 ) with the same quantum numbers @xmath43 and @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the selection rules corresponding to transverse monopole - like transitions are @xmath122 ( as we have already discussed in the previous section ) and @xmath139 .    from the spectrum of elementary excitations",
    ", we have found that there are only @xmath140 pairs of levels that verify the transverse monopole selection rules and the energy condition ( [ selection ] ) at @xmath141 .",
    "the damping strengths associated to the allowed transitions are smaller than the @xmath125 values associated to quadrupole - like transitions . as a result from our calculations the damping occurs quite small . at @xmath142",
    "we obtain a landau damping @xmath143 that is one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental decay @xcite @xmath144 measured in @xcite .",
    "thus , landau damping can not explain the experimentally observed decay of the transverse breathing mode .    actually , there are reasons to believe that even this small value of landau damping obtained in the present calculations , could be larger than the true one .",
    "the point is that in our calculations , based on perturbation theory , the thermal cloud is assumed to be in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium and thus one can neglect its motion .",
    "this is correct for the case of quadrupole oscillations , where the frequencies of the collective motion of the condensate and the cloud are different .",
    "however , due to the unique peculiar nature of the 2d breathing mode , the breathing oscillation of the thermal cloud has the same frequency @xmath145 as the condensate .",
    "then , if the oscillation is excited by the deformation of the trap , as it takes place in the present experiment @xcite , the cloud will oscillate in phase with the condensate what will further decrease the landau damping @xcite .",
    "therefore , this quasi-2d monopole mode in highly elongated condensates may decay via another damping mechanism , different from the landau damping .    after finishing this work it has appeared a preprint by jackson and zaremba @xcite in which the effect of the collisions between elementary excitations has been taken also into account .",
    "this effect is usually small in comparison with the landau damping .",
    "nevertheless , for this peculiar mode the collisions seems to be the dominant damping mechanism , yielding a decay rate that it is in agreement with the experimentally measured value @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the experiments are produced at quite high amplitude of oscillations and non - linear effects can play an important role .",
    "for example , as it was noted in @xcite , the transverse breathing mode exhibits a ",
    "parametric  instability due to the decay into two or more excitations with non - zero momentum along the axis . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been considered the process in which the transverse breathing oscillation decays into two excitations propagating along @xmath0 with momentum @xmath1 and @xmath146 .",
    "this damping mechanism is active also at zero temperature .",
    "but in this case the damping rate depends on the amplitude of the breathing oscillation .",
    "we have investigated the decay of low - lying transverse oscillations of a large cylindrical condensate .",
    "first of all , we have calculated the transverse normal modes , as well as the excitations with finite @xmath1 , of the condensate by solving the linearized time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation . and",
    "then , within the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have calculated numerically the matrix elements associated with the transitions between excited states allowed by the selection rules of the transverse collective modes . within a first - order perturbation theory and assuming the thermal cloud to be in thermodynamic equilibrium , we have studied the landau damping of transverse collective modes due to the coupling with thermal excited levels as a function of temperature . for the damping rate of the transverse quadrupole mode",
    ", we have found a good agreement with the experimentally measured value of ref .  @xcite . whereas our result for the transverse breathing mode is one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental decay .",
    "one can conclude that in a highly elongated cylindrically symmetric condensate , transverse quadrupole oscillations decay via landau damping mechanism , but the transverse breathing mode which has an anomalously small measured damping rate , may decay via other damping mechanisms .",
    "we thank j.  dalibard , g.  shlyapnikov and e.  zaremba for useful discussions .",
    "m.  g. thanks the `` ramon y cajal program '' of the mcyt ( spain ) for financial support .                                        note that the  perturbative  calculations of the landau damping can correspond to a different type of experiment , in which the oscillations of the condensate are excited by the action of a thin laser beam on the condensate , but not on the thermal cloud . in this case",
    "the  perturbative  calculations will describe the initial stage of the process , when the cloud is still at rest . as it was presented in the lecture by e. zaremba @xcite , the landau damping corresponding to this type of experiment was calculated using the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in an elongated condensate with the same experimental parameters of ref .",
    "however , they have obtained larger values for the landau damping of the transverse breathing mode in comparison with our results .",
    "this discrepancy could be related to the semiclassical nature of their method @xcite , which does not take into account the discrete nature of the energy spectrum , and also to the fact that they consider a cigar - shaped condensate instead of an infinite cylinder as in the present calculations .",
    "the finite value of the longitudinal frequency @xmath147 could be important for this transverse breathing mode .",
    "therefore , this is still an interesting open problem ."
