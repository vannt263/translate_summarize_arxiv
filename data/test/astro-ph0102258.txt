    "one of the basic goals of large scale structure study is to reconstruct the initial mass field of the universe .",
    "assuming observed objects trace the underlying matter field in some way , it should be possible to recover the initial conditions of the mass field .",
    "for instance , if the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the initial mass fluctuations is gaussian , one may recover the initial gaussian mass fluctuations by properly removing all non - gaussian features via the gaussianization reconstruction algorithm ( weinberg 1992 . )",
    "the key step in the gaussianization algorithm is a mapping from a smoothed observed non - gaussian distribution of the density contrast , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the mass density , and @xmath3 is its mean ) into a smoothed initial gaussian density contrast @xmath4 .",
    "the basic assumptions of this mapping are that the relation between @xmath5 and the initial density distribution @xmath4 is local and monotonic , i.e. , the rank order of the mass density field , smoothed over a given scale , is preserved even under nonlinear gravitation evolution(narayanan & weinberg 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the high initial density pixels will evolve into high @xmath5 pixels and low initial density pixels into low @xmath5 pixels . with this assumption",
    ", the gaussian mapping can be realized by a point - to - point , order - preserving transformation .",
    "the shape of the initial gaussian density field is recovered with an arbitrary normalization .",
    "this method has been employed to recover the initial mass field and power spectrum from galaxy redshift surveys and from the transmitted flux of the ly@xmath0 absorption in qso spectra ( croft et al .",
    "the validity of the point - to - point ( or pixel - to - pixel ) recovery of the initial gaussian mass field from the evolved mass field stems from the belief that the transmitted flux probably is a pixel - to - pixel tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution ( bi 1993 ; fang et al . 1993 ; bi , ge & fang 1995 ; hernquist et al 1996 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ; hui , gnedin & zhang 1997 . )    however , whether the order - preserving assumption is reasonable is far from clear .",
    "it has been argued that the order - preserving condition may be a poor approximation to the actual dynamics because of the non - locality of gravitational evolution ( monaco & efstathiou 2000 ) .",
    "gravitational clustering is not localized . even in the weakly non - linear evolutionary regime ,",
    "the processes of cosmic clustering typically are those of objects free falling into potential wells ( e.g. xu , fang & wu 2000 ) , fourier mode - mode coupling ( e. g. suto & sasaki 1991 ) , and the merging of pre - virialized dark halos .",
    "these processes are generally _ non - local_.    in the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) , the density field @xmath6 at ( eulerian ) comoving position @xmath7 and time @xmath8 is determined by the initial perturbation at ( lagrangian ) comoving position , @xmath9 , plus a displacement @xmath10 : @xmath11 the displacement @xmath12 represents the effect of density perturbations on the trajectories of gravitating particles .",
    "therefore , cosmic self - gravitating systems do not follow a eulerian _ point - to - point _",
    "localized evolution .",
    "even when the transmitted flux is locally determined by the evolved underlying dark matter distribution , the relation between the initial mass field and the transmitted flux might still be non - local . the initial power spectrum reconstructed from the point - to - point gaussian",
    "mapping of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux shows a systematic suppression on small scales ( croft et al . 1999 . )",
    "this problem may be mitigated by smoothing the data .",
    "however , the smoothing scale is put in by hand and it is hard to understand how this scale can be determined from the dynamics of the non - local evolution . for these reasons",
    "the basis of the order - preserving transformation and the point - to - point gaussian mapping need to be reconsidered .    in this paper , we will show first that the assumption of point - to - point locality is not necessary for a proper gaussianization reconstruction .",
    "recently , we showed that the transmitted flux gaussianized by the point - to - point gaussian mapping is still largely non - gaussian ( feng & fang 2000 . )",
    "that is , the non - gaussianities of the original transmitted flux are retained in the mass field recovered by the point - to - point , order - preserving transformation .",
    "especially troubling is the fact that the scale - scale correlations of the gaussianized field are about the same as before the mapping .",
    "the mass power spectrum recovered by the point - to - point gaussian mapping is systematically lower than the initial mass spectrum on scales at which the scale - scale correlation of the recovered mass field are substantial .    to solve this problem ,",
    "a scale - by - scale algorithm of the gaussian mapping was proposed ( feng & fang 2000 . ) in this algorithm the order - preserving transformation is done on the coefficients of a space - scale decomposition rather than on each pixel of the transmitted flux .",
    "this method can effectively remove the non - gaussianities of the observed distribution , especially clearing the scale - scale correlations .",
    "consequently , small scale suppression is significantly reduced .",
    "furthermore , the scale - by - scale gaussianization procedure does not require a point - to - point order preservation , but only the order preservation of the density fluctuations of the space - scale decomposed field .",
    "we will show that the order preservation assumption for the scale - by - scale gaussian mapping is supported by the zeldovich approximation and that in quasi - linear evolution , the gravitational clustering is quasi - local and monotonic .",
    "moreover , we will find that the non - gaussian features during the weakly non - linear regime are dominated by the local scale - scale correlations .",
    "therefore , at least for the transmitted flux and forest lines of the qso ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum , the scale - by - scale gaussianization algorithm has a solid basis in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the quasi - locality condition needed for the scale - by - scale gaussianization recovery . in section 3",
    "we show the quasi - locality and monotonic nature of the weak non - linear evolution using the zeldovich solution of the growth modes .",
    "section 4 presents the result of measuring the quasi - locality for samples of the ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "let us briefly introduce the algorithm for a point - to - point gaussian mapping which is designed for recovering the initial gaussian mass density contrast @xmath13 from an observed , non - gaussian distribution @xmath14 .",
    "as an example , we consider an observed transmitted flux @xmath15 or absorption optical depth @xmath16 of the ly@xmath0 absorption in qso spectra .",
    "the distribution is one  dimensional and of length @xmath17 .",
    "the pdf of the observed transmitted flux @xmath15 is generally non - gaussian , while the pdf of the initial density contrast @xmath18 is assumed to be gaussian in a large variety of structure formation models .",
    "the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is assumed to be order - preserved , or monotonic , i.e. , high initial density @xmath20 pixels evolve into high absorption optical depth @xmath21 pixels , while low initial density pixels into low @xmath21 pixels .",
    "thus , a point - to - point ( or pixel - to - pixel ) gaussian mapping can be done as follows .",
    "first , sort in ascending order , the @xmath22 pixels by the observed amount of flux .",
    "second , assign to the n - th pixel a density contrast @xmath23 by the solving the error function equation @xmath24 .",
    "this pixel - to - pixel gaussian mapping produces a mass field with the same rank order as the original flux but with a gaussian pdf . after determining the overall amplitude of the gaussian mapped field by a separate procedure ,",
    "the initial density field @xmath20 is recovered ( weinberg 1992 . )",
    "however , the density field recovered by the pixel - to - pixel gaussian mapping still exhibits non - gaussian features .",
    "especially , the scale - scale correlations of the gaussianized field are almost as strong as the pre - gaussianized flux .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel gaussian mapping does not remove all the non - gaussianities and the initial gaussian field will not be recovered precisely . the power spectrum recovered by the point - to - point gaussian",
    "mapping is systematically lower than the initial mass spectrum on scales at which the scale - scale correlation is substantial .",
    "physically , the effect might just be due to the fact that @xmath23 is simply too non - linear , and the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath20 is no longer monotonic .",
    "if this is the case , then a scale - adaptive smoothing is required before gaussianization .",
    "however , a smoothing window function sometimes introduces spurious features .",
    "for instance , the aliasing of the power spectrum on scales around the nyquist frequency corresponds to the scale of the smoothing grid .",
    "however with the dwt analysis one need not introduce window functions for smoothing because the scaling functions of the wavelet transform already play that role .",
    "the scaling function is orthogonal to the relevant wavelets .",
    "false correlations due to the smoothing window can then be perfectly eliminated ( feng & fang 2000 . ) therefore , a scale - adaptive smoothing and reconstruction can be realized by the scale - by - scale gaussian mapping .",
    "scale - by - scale , or scale - adaptive gaussianization can be performed via the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "the first step in this process is to wavelet expand the flux @xmath15 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , is an orthogonal and complete basis . the wavelet basis ( mode ) @xmath26 is localized both in physical space and in fourier ( scale ) space .",
    "the function @xmath26 is centered at position @xmath29 in physical space and at wavenumber @xmath30 in fourier space .",
    "the wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) , @xmath31 , are labeled by the two subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponding to the scale and position respectively .",
    "the @xmath31 describe the fluctuation of the flux on scale @xmath34 at position @xmath29 and are computed as the inner product @xmath35    the density fields in cosmology are assumed to be ergodic , that is , the average over an ensemble is equal to the spatial average taken over _",
    "one _ realization .",
    "this is the so - called fair sample hypothesis ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a homogeneous gaussian field with a continuous power spectrum is certainly ergodic(adler 1981 ) . in some non - gaussian cases , such as homogeneous and isotropic turbulence , ergodicity",
    "also approximately holds(vanmarke , 1983 ) .",
    "roughly , the ergodic assumption is reasonable if the spatial correlations decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing separation .",
    "this property can effectively be used by the dwt because the wavelet @xmath26 are orthogonal with respect to the position index @xmath33 . the sfcs @xmath31 ( @xmath36 )",
    "can be considered as @xmath37 independent sampling , without false correlations caused by a non - orthogonal or redundant decomposition .",
    "thus , for ergodic random fields the @xmath37 wfcs form a statistical ensemble on scale @xmath32 .",
    "so for quantity @xmath38 , the ensemble average is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the quantity at position @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , the distribution of the @xmath37 wfcs is the one - point distribution of @xmath41 .    in short",
    "we have arrived at the scale - by - scale gaussianization algorithm which consists of the following steps : 1 . )",
    "sort out the @xmath37 wfcs , @xmath31 , of the flux field @xmath15 in ascending order .",
    "2 . ) assign to the @xmath37 wfcs , the gaussianized density contrast @xmath42 at position @xmath33 by the solving the error function equation . in this algorithm , the order - preserving transformation is performed scale - by - scale .",
    "it gives a position(@xmath33)-to - position(@xmath33 ) gaussian mapping for each scale @xmath32 .",
    "after a proper amplitude normalization ( feng & fang 2000 ) , the initial gaussian density field @xmath20 is reconstructed with the gaussianized wfcs @xmath43 ( we have added the subscript @xmath44 to emphasize that we are dealing with a gaussian field . )    the @xmath43 are normally distributed with covariance given by @xmath45 for a homogeneous gaussian field , @xmath46 is @xmath33-independent , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , @xmath48 is the power spectrum of the initial field .",
    "( pando & fang 1998b , feng & fang 2000 , fang & feng , 2000 . )",
    "because the 2@xmath49 wfcs @xmath43 form a fair ensemble , the dwt power spectrum @xmath48 of the initial field can be calculated by @xmath50 where @xmath51    in our numerical calculation , we generally use the compactly supported basis daubechies 4 ( d4 ) ( daubechies 1992 ) .",
    "the choice of particular compactly supported wavelet basis does not effect the statistical results ( pando & fang 1996 ) and the d4 wavelet is chosen as a matter of convenience .",
    "although the so called haar wavelet appears to be simpler , it is not well behaved in scale space ( fang & thews 1998 . )      to demonstrate the scale - by - scale gaussian mapping , we recover the initial gaussian mass field of a simulation sample of ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the simulation samples are produced by a semi - analytic model of the intergalactic medium ( bi 1993 ; fang et al . 1993 . )",
    "this model approximately fits most observed features of the ly@xmath0 clouds , including the column density distribution and the number density of the lines , the distribution of equivalent widths and their redshift dependence , the clustering of the lines , and even the 3rd- and 4th - order non - gaussian features ( bi , ge & fang 1995 ; bi & davidsen 1997 , feng & fang , 2000 . )",
    "we produce the simulation samples in redshift range @xmath52 with @xmath53 pixels .",
    "the corresponding simulation size in the cdm model is 189.84 h@xmath54mpc in comoving space .",
    "these scales weakly depend on @xmath55 .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical realization of the simulated ly@xmath0 , including the flux @xmath15 , density contrast of igm , @xmath56 , peculiar velocity of the igm , @xmath57 and the column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath58 .",
    "the recovered igm density distributions on scales @xmath59 h@xmath54 mpc and @xmath60 are plotted in fig .",
    "these results show that the density distributions can be well reconstructed by the dwt algorithm .",
    "the small deviation of the recovered distributions from the original one is due mainly to the effect of the peculiar velocity .",

    "it shows that the recovered power spectrum is in excellent agreement with the initial one until scale @xmath61 or @xmath62 h mpc@xmath54 .",
    "this means that the effect of the peculiar velocity is significant only on small scales @xmath63 .",
    "however , our goal is to put the scale - of - scale algorithm on a firm foundation and so recovering the power spectrum from simulation samples is insufficient for our purposes .",
    "we must investigate the conditions under which the basic assumption of the scale - of - scale algorithm  the order - preserving transformation ",
    "is reasonable .",
    "the scale - by - scale gaussian mapping assumes the order preservation between the wfcs @xmath31 of the evolved field and the initial wfcs @xmath64 at each scale @xmath32 . for scale",
    "@xmath32 , index @xmath33 corresponds to a spatial range @xmath34 .",
    "the scale - by - scale gaussianization algorithm does not require a point - point ( or pixel - pixel ) locality , but only a locality in the range of @xmath65 .    for scale @xmath32 ,",

    "therefore , all results drawn from eq.(16 ) still hold for eq.(49 ) if the intersection of the particle trajectories has not yet happen .",
    "it is known that the non - linear effect of the redshift distortion , like the fingers - of - god in the galaxy distribution in redshift space , can not be modeled by the zeldovich solution .",
    "in other words , the non - linear effects of the redshift distortion are not negligible if the zeldovich solution fails .",
    "thus , the scale on which the quasi - locality assumption is no longer correct is also the scale where the non - linear redshift distortion effects emerge .",
    "this result is consistent with the numerical example shown in  2.3 , which shows that on scales as small as @xmath61 , the scale - by - scale reconstruction is still very good , and the redshift distortion effects are not yet significant .",

    "these non - local correlations may be caused by problems in identifying the lines , and if so , indicates that the transmitted flux is better suited than the ly@xmath0 forest lines for a gaussianization reconstruction .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that the assumptions necessary for reconstructing an initial density field by a scale - dependent gaussianization procedure are justified .",
    "the assumptions , namely the locality and monotonic nature of the gravitational clustering , are borne out by both the zeldovich approximation and correlation analysis of qso ly@xmath0 samples .",
    "that is , the dwt mode - mode coupling caused by the weakly non - linear evolution of the gravitational clustering is quasi - local and that the large initial wfcs evolve into large wfcs of the observed density field .",
    "this result provides a solid basis for the dwt scale - by - scale gaussianization reconstruction of ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the non - gaussianities produced by the mode - mode coupling during the weakly non - linear regime are mainly local scale - scale correlations .",
    "this result explains why the gaussianization reconstruction is substantially improved by removing the local scale - scale correlations ( feng & fang 2000 . )",
    "clearing the local scale - scale correlation is a key for an effective gaussianization reconstruction .",
    "all these features provide a solid basis for the dwt scale - by - scale ( or scale - adaptive ) gaussianization reconstruction algorithm .",
    "since galaxies undergo a highly non - linear evolution , and their bias might be non - monotonic , the validity of the order preserving assumption for the galaxy field needs further study .",
    "whether a sample is suitable for the dwt scale - by - scale reconstruction can be judged by detecting the non - local mode - mode correlations .",
    "if the scale - scale correlations are significantly non - local , the sample will not be a good candidate for a dwt scale - by - scale gaussianization .",
    "the local scale - scale correlation have been detected in recent years for galaxy samples , such as the apm bright galaxy catalog ( feng , deng & fang 2000 . )",
    "however , it remains to be determined whether these couplings are non - localized .",
    "in essence , the dwt analysis looks at the phase space behavior of the gravitational clustering . while there are many perturbation calculations of the clustering dynamics in the fourier and coordinate representations ( buchert 1993 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ; catelan 1995 ) , the locality can not be revealed with these calculations , because in the fourier representation , the phases hold the position information ( locality ) of the relevant fourier modes .",
    "this makes it practically impossible to determine the locality of clustering in the fourier representation",
    ". the dwt analysis may also be useful in studying other clustering features in the zeldovich approximation for which a phase space description is essential , such as the breakdown of the galilean invariance or the lack of momentum conservation ( polyakov 1995 ; scoccimarro 1998 . )",
