    "electronic transport through a single - molecule magnet ( smm ) has been intensively studied both experimentally@xcite and theoreticallyromeike1,romeike2,elste , timm , xue , leuenberger , misiorny , luhz stimulated by the prospect of a new generation of molecule - based electronic and spintronic devices@xcite .",
    "recently , the current fluctuation in electron transport through single - molecule magnet or molecular junction has been attracting much interest@xcite owing to its allowing one to identify the internal level structure of the transport systembelzig and to access information of electron correlation that can not be contained in the differential conductance and the average currentblanter .",
    "these studies were mainly focused on the infinite coulomb interaction regime@xcite .",
    "in fact , coulomb interaction is usually finite in a realistic mesoscopic system and thus one should consider the effects of the finite coulomb interaction on the current correlation . in most mesoscopic systems ,",
    "the negative correlation induced by coulomb interaction may impose a time delay between two consecutive electron transfers and lead to the suppression of shot noise so that sub - poissonian shot noise occurs .",
    "for example , in symmetrical double - barrier junctionschen and in nondegenerate diffusive conductors@xcite the 1/2 and 1/3 suppression fano - factors have been found , respectively .",
    "however , in the presence of a strong nonlinearity of the @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristics , the coulomb interaction can yield a positive correlation and enhance the noise even to be super - poissonian@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was first discovered in double - barrier tunneling diodes in the negative differential conductance ( ndc ) regime and a fano factor up to 6.6 was observed@xcite . in the ndc regime ,",
    "coulomb interaction and the density - shape of states in the well introduce positive correlation between consecutive current pulses , which leads to a super - poissonian shot noise . in general , the effect of coulomb interaction on the shot noise is more complicated .",
    "for instance , in mesoscopic coherent conductors ( at sufficiently large voltages ) coulomb interaction decreases the shot noise at low transmissions and increases it at high transmissions@xcite .",
    "shot - noise measurements in mesoscopic devices can also provide information about the effective charge @xmath4 of the current - carrying particles . for a quantum - dot system in the kondo regime , the simultaneous presence of one- and two - quasiparticle scattering results in a universal average charge @xmath5@xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coulomb interaction remarkably influences the effective backscattering charge of current - carrying particles via a correction factor ( @xmath6 ) which is less than unity .",
    "furthermore , the effect of coulomb interaction on the shot noise can be employed to reveal important information of the energy profile of nonequilibrium carriers injected from an emitter contact , but which can not be obtained from shot - noise measurements in the absence of coulomb interactions@xcite . in the present smm system with finite coulomb energy @xmath0 , an electron from one lead tunnels into the smm and",
    "then leaves the smm through the other lead via two kinds of transition processes : ( i ) between the singly - occupied and empty states , ( ii ) between doubly - occupied and the singly - occupied states which does not occur under the infinite coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , it is significant to study the effect of finite coulomb interaction on the current fluctuation in the smm system .    an alternative way to investigate the current fluctuation , known as",
    "the full counting statistics ( fcs ) , has been proposed in the pioneering work by levitov _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the method yields not only shot - noise power but also all the statistical cumulants of the number of transferred charges .",
    "the transport through mesoscopic devices is fully described by the fcs , which may provide the full information about the probability distribution @xmath7 of transferring @xmath8 electrons between electrode and smm during a time interval @xmath9 .",
    "the fcs is obtained from the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) that is related to the probability distribution by@xcite@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the counting field .",
    "all cumulants of the current can be obtained from the cgf by performing derivatives with respect to the counting field @xmath12 . in the long - time limit ,",
    "the first three cumulants are directly related to the transport characteristics . for example , the first - order cumulant ( the peak position of the distribution of transferred - electron number ) @xmath13 gives the average current @xmath14 .",
    "the zero - frequency shot noise is related to the second - order cumulant ( the peak - width of the distribution ) @xmath15 .",
    "the third cumulant @xmath16 characterizes the skewness of the distribution .",
    "here , @xmath17 .",
    "in general , the shot noise and the skewness are commonly represented by the fano factor @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .    since the electron - electron interaction may bring correlations and entanglement of electron states , the shot noise in the mesoscopic system with coulomb interaction has attracted the significant attentiongalaktionov , golub .",
    "the study of fcs of interacting electrons in mesoscopic systems has become a challenging subject of great interest @xcite . in this letter , we study the fcs of electron transport through smm weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes , here the first three cumulants are given in terms of numerical calculation . in the model considered here two electrodes",
    "are regarded as non - interacting fermi gases , while the central smm is treated as a multi - level system with finite coulomb interaction .",
    "we found that the effect of finite coulomb interaction on the shot noise depends not only on the internal level structure of the smm , but also on the left - right asymmetry of the smm - electrode coupling .",
    "in particular , our analytical results indicate that for finite coulomb interaction the fcs , which is different from the case of @xmath20 , shows a symmetrical gate - voltage - dependence when both the intensities of the smm coupling to the left and right electrodes are interchanged , which originates from the both symmetries of the effective channel energy levels and the probability distribution .",

    "in the following we study the effect of finite coulomb interaction on the fcs of electronic transport through the smm weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes .",
    "we assume the bias voltage ( @xmath107 ) is symmetrically entirely dropped at the smm - electrode tunnel junctions , which implies that the levels of the smm are independent of the applied bias voltage even if the couplings are not symmetric .",
    "the parameters of the smm are chosen as@xcite @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114  is the typical rate for the tunneling of electrons between the smm and electrode .",

    "therefore , the effect of the smm s spin - relaxation processes on the fcs can be neglected .",
    "the thermal energy corresponding to the temperature considered is much smaller than energy barrier so that thermally activated transitions above the barrier can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , we assume the external magnetic field is applied along the smm s easy axis and transverse anisotropy is small enough relative to the easy - axis anisotropy so that the magnetic quantum tunneling can also be neglected .    in the present work",

    "the inelastic sequential tunneling process is dominant , thus electrons have sufficient energy to overcome the coulomb blockade and tunnel sequentially through the smm .",
    "a special emphasis is the effects of the strongly asymmetric coupling to two electrodes and gate voltage on super - poissonian noise .",
    "the sequential tunneling requires a change of the electron number by @xmath131 and the magnetic quantum number by @xmath132 , so that the sequential tunneling threshold depends on the effective channel energy levels in bias voltage window which are given by    @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135    @xmath136    where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",

    "the transport characteristic should easily be observed experimentally by reversing the bias voltage between the left and right electrodes and tuning the applied gate voltage ; but for the case of @xmath181 , this feature will not be observed because the transition processes between doubly - occupied and the singly - occupied states are prohibited .",
    "it is generally thought that the coulomb interaction gives rise to the suppression of shot noise@xcite . for the present smm system with finite coulomb interaction ,",
    "however , the super - poissonian shot noise is observed in the sequential tunneling regime . for a given @xmath152 , as shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( e ) , the super - poissonian noise for @xmath161 occurs at higher gate voltage such as @xmath182 and @xmath156 , while that for @xmath166 occurs at lower gate voltage such as @xmath183 and @xmath169 , which is consistent with the @xmath1 case@xcite .",

    "three sets of the fast - and - slow channel currents are formed , @xmath96 , @xmath190 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , which result in the second enhancement of shot noise .",

    "the competition between the increase of the slow channel currents and the decrease of the fast channel currents finally leads to appearing of super - poissonian fano factor in the bias from about @xmath197 to @xmath198 [ the short dashed line in fig .",
    "furthermore , we also observe that the super - poissonian distribution of the skewness @xmath199 in the sequential tunneling regime [ fig .",
    "1(c ) ] , which seems sensitive only to the competition between the fast channels of current decreasing and the slow channels of current increasing [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . as for @xmath178  at lower gate voltage , the mechanism of shot - noise enhancement originates from the same reason but the effective fast - and - slow transport channels consist of the transitions from the singly - occupied states to empty states , see fig .",
    "furthermore , in the coulomb blockade regime ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the shot noise enhancement , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , is due to the possible thermal occupation and subsequent sequential depletion of excited states that lead to small cascades of tunneling events interrupted by long coulomb blockages .",
    "in fact , since in the coulomb blockade regime the current is exponentially suppressed and the electron transport is dominated by cotunneling , when taking into account cotunneling the normalized second and third moments will deviate from the results obtained by only sequential tunneling@xcite .",
    "in contrast with the above case , we find that the finite coulomb interaction plays a crucial role in determining whether the super - poissonian noise occurs in situations with relatively small gate voltage for @xmath200  and relatively large gate voltage for @xmath201 . in order to study the effects of finite coulomb interaction on the shot noise in transport through the smm for the two above - mentioned cases , fig .",
