    "characterizing the differences between quantum physics and classical physics is of fundamental interest for understanding of the quantumness of nature .",
    "usually there are quantum counterparts of classical physics , such as the coherent states in the system of the harmonic oscillator , or factorizable quantum states in the field of quantum entanglement .",
    "these pure counterparts can be generalized to mixed quantum states via a classical mixtures of these pure ones .",
    "thus , we obtain the convex set of states having classical counterparts with respect to some physical properties to be specified .    in general , it is of great interest to compare the nonclassicality of different physical states . for the comparison",
    ", an ordering procedure is required .",
    "the standard approach is given in terms of measures for quantifying the amount of nonclassicality of a given state .",
    "in the system of the harmonic oscillator one of the early attempts to quantify the amount of nonclassicality  in terms of coherent states  has been given by the trace - distance of an arbitrary state from the set of all nonclassical states  @xcite .",
    "this led to a number of nonclassicality measures based on distances , e.g. hilbert - schmidt - norm based measures  @xcite , or the bures distance  @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on the fischer information  @xcite , which can be related to the distance based ones .",
    "some measures consider the arising negativities of the @xmath0  function for nonclassical states .",
    "a quantifier is the amount of gaussian noise which is needed for the elimination of negativities within the @xmath0  function  @xcite .",
    "whereas , the negativities of the wigner function itself are also used for the quantification of nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "another method for the quantification of a nonclassical state is given via the potential of this state to generate entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this transfers the quantification of nonclassicality of the harmonic oscillator to the quantification of entanglement , which has the same type of problems .",
    "the axiomatic definition of an entanglement measure is given in  @xcite .",
    "this definition is based on so called local operations and classical communications .",
    "they map separable quantum states to separable ones . under all examples of entanglement measures ,",
    "there is one which is of particular interest for our considerations : the schmidt number  @xcite .",
    "we have studied some properties of this entanglement measure in relation to other measures  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to connect the amount of nonclassicality with a distinct quantum operation .",
    "this leads us to so called operational measures for entanglement and nonclassicality  @xcite , quantifying the usable amount of entanglement and nonclassicality , respectively . in this case",
    ", a formally nonclassical state can have no usable nonclassicality , if this state can not be applied for the given quantum operation .",
    "the mentioned entanglement potential would also be a measure of such a type .",
    "in the present contribution we consider the ordering of quantum states with respect to an arbitrary classical property .",
    "it shows that distance measures are , in general , not completely suitable for ordering quantum states unambiguously .",
    "starting from the algebraic definition of convex sets we introduce and study an order which does not dependend on a distinct topological distance .",
    "we expand this method to include classical manipulations of the quantum state in an experiment , and classical noise effects .",
    "the ordering procedure delivers a quantification in a natural way .",
    "we obtain nonclassicality measures , with respect to the considered classical property .",
    "we apply this method to a basic example , showing the importance of the quantum superposition principle for the quantification of nonclassical effects .",

    "let us denote with @xmath1 the convex set of all ( pure and mixed ) quantum states .",
    "let us consider a closed and convex subset @xmath2 .",
    "further on , let us assume that the elements of @xmath3 have somehow classical properties ( e.g. they are either separable states , or coherent states , etc . ) .",
    "therefore we call an element @xmath4 classical .",
    "the general task is to find the amount of nonclassicality of arbitrary quantum states @xmath5 .",
    "a natural way of ordering quantum states is given by the distance of these states to the set of classical states @xmath3 .",
    "here we will show that ordering quantum states by a distance can not deliver a distinct order of states .",
    "this problem already occurs for very elementary examples .",
    "let us assume the two dimensional , convex subset @xmath3 of a vector space @xmath6 , with @xmath7 now let us consider two elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the distance @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for all @xmath12-norms ( see appendix [ app : vecspace ] ) the optimal distance for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is given for the classical vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "thus we can calculate @xmath17 and @xmath18 for different values of @xmath12 , @xmath19 this result displays the ambiguity of a quantification of nonclassicality with distance measures .",

    "in this case the norm represents somehow the potential to solve the given task .",
    "however , the properties of the chosen norm influences the quantification .",
    "this ordering is not strict in a way , that it only depends on the definition  the inherent physical property  of the classical set @xmath3 .",
    "but the general motivation was , to comepare the nonclassicality of quantum states , which should be independent of the application of these states .    in fig .",

    "it becomes clear , that the choice of the norm has a fundamental influence on the amount of nonclassicality . for one norm",
    "both states have an equal amount of nonclassicality .",
    "another norm delivers that one state is more nonclassical then the other one .",

    "often the quantification is ambiguous and it strongly depends on the definition of the used distance .",
    "the origin of such problems lies in the fact that the nature of nonclassicality is an algebraic rather than a topological one : the classical combinations of pure classical states are typically convex subsets of all quantum states .    based on the conservation of the classical property under mixing ,",

    "we have obtained nonclassicality measures in a natural way .",
    "the method has been applied to a typical example in quantum physics .",
    "our conclusion is that the number ( minus one ) of superpositions of classical pure states needed to generate the quantum state under study represents a nonclassicality measure of the type we are interested in . for this measure misleading properties , such as those depending on the chosen definition of some topological distance , do not occur .",
