    "the study of composite materials is of great interest in various fields such as aerospace engineering and industry in which the metallic materials can be advantageously replaced . to that purpose ,",
    "the modelling and numerical simulations of such composites are essential to the design with optimal electrical , mechanical and thermal properties , since authentic experiments are hugely expensive .    in this paper , composite materials constituted by a matrix ( modelling classical polymers or plastics ) reinforced by",
    "poorly or highly conductive inclusions are considerated .",
    "the inclusions are constituted by a mixture of cylinders and spheres .",
    "we also consider two kinds of variations around the shape of inclusions : the spheres and cylinders which are corrugated or some pieces of the inclusions are excavated and/or removed to produce irregular shapes as it is shown in fig . [ defect ] .",
    "[ def1 ] [ def2 ]    this study , focuses on the influence of the morphology and the influence of the variation of shapes for the homogenized thermal conductivity of such composite material by extending the study of the mechanical behaviour published in a previous paper ( @xcite ) to thermal properties .",
    "the main interest of this study is to give two information about a material , for instance its mechanical and thermal behaviour .    for the influence of the morphology ,",
    "our work has consisted in the study of the impact of the geometry and the volume fraction of globular and fibre type inclusions . for this purpose ,",
    "we have taken into account several parameters such as the number , the volume fraction of each type of inclusions , and for the fibre type inclusions , we have studied the aspect ratio ( fig .",
    "[ aspect ] ) which are able to distinguish short or long fibre .        for the influence of the variations of shape inclusions ( fig .",
    "[ defect ] ) , we have varied the wave parameter for the first variation ( see fig . [ wave ] ) and the volume fraction of defects ( @xmath0 ) which designates the volume fraction of pieces of inclusions excavated for the second variation .",
    "classically ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , the key idea is to consider a large enough sample of a composite material and compute the macroscopic parameters such as the components of the conductivity tensor in the case of isotropic or quasi - isotropic materials .",
    "such samples are called representative volume element ( rve ) .    for the same reasons described in our previous work",
    ", we use a series of samples ( rves ) generated randomly ( @xcite ) , by controlling their parameters such as the number of spheres and cylinders , the aspect ratio , the volume fraction and we perform the computation for each of them before averaging the result .    the macroscopic thermal properties computations of the rves are obtained by homogenization methods based on fft techniques which had been introduced in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that we have adapted for thermal analysis .",
    "the rves are modelled as large 3d images ( over 7 million voxels per image ) .",
    "finite element method also can be used , but we choose the fft - based method due to the computational efficiency considerations .",
    "we used finite element method mainly for comparison and validation of our fft - based code .    to compare the mechanical and thermal behaviour",
    ", we follow the presentation introduced in ( @xcite ) and we exhibit the trends with the same parameters which have been shown in our previous paper ( @xcite ) and which are more significant .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section 2 is devoted to the presentation of the sample generation and the computational techniques . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of the computed thermal properties of considered composite materials .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we compare the trends observed with thermal properties with the mechanical ones and we give our conclusions and outlooks .    in the appendices , we recall the thermal model used and the fft - based homogenization method . in the last appendix , to help the reader a table with all parameters and their range",
    "is also given .",
    "in composite homogenization , the rve generation including inclusions is a key stage and a real challenge especially with periodic boundary conditions . the generation scheme must be robust , reliable , fast and able to reach high volume fraction of inclusions .",
    "the rve consists of a random mixture in 3d of inclusions which are spherical and cylindrical without intersection in a first state , and in a second state with variations on inclusions shapes .",
    "there are many works with ellipsoidal or spherical inclusions ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) but the case with cylinders presents geometric difficulties that we have resolved and detailed in @xcite .",
    "however , another key point is how to generate samples randomly .",
    "there are two families of generation algorithm : random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "rsa is based on sequential addition of inclusion until there is no intersection with any other inclusion already inserted .",
    "this method generates rves with about @xmath1 volume fraction and aspect ratio ( see [ aspect ] ) smaller than 16 . for higher volume fraction and for high aspect ratio , this method can stuck and one prefers the second method based on molecular dynamics .",
    "md consists in generating all inclusions and after moving them to the desired configuration using a time - driven version .",
    "this method allows the generation up to @xmath2 . for more details ,",
    "the two algorithms are given in @xcite .",
    "our calculations have been made with the first method due to the choice of the morphology parameters . to illustrate the type of rve used , we present two examples with a mixture of non intersecting spherical and cylindrical inclusions with low and high volume fraction .",
    "concerning the inclusions with shape variations ( @xcite ) , we consider corrugated inclusions , or , we remove some pieces of inclusions ( see the fig .",
    "[ defect ] ) after generating spheres and cylinders at the pixelization ( or voxelization ) step . for these rves , we have created inclusions with distorted shapes to compare their behaviour with the non distorted ones . for our computations , we use a `` wave parameter '' between 0 and 1 ( see fig . [ wave ] ) in order to corrugate the inclusions and a volume fraction of defects ( @xmath0)between 0 and 0.27 .",
    "[ wave ] fig.[wave ] : 2d cylinder view with 3 corrugations    legend of fig .",
    "[ wave ] :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is the cylinder radius , 2 .",
    "@xmath4 is the corrugated radius .",
    "@xmath5 3 .   where @xmath6 is a periodic function .",
    "this section describes briefly how the thermal behaviour of a composite material is obtained , we let the reader see the appendices for more details .",
    "once the rves are generated , we can proceed to the computation of effective thermal properties . then , to evaluate these properties , a stochastic homogenization is done ( see appendix [ approach ] ) .",
    "the thermal model used for our computation is more precisely described in appendix [ model ] .",
    "this approach has a twofold advantage , both in time and memory consumption in comparison to the finite elements method .",
    "furthermore , there are several fft - based numerical schemes such as the basic scheme , the dual scheme , the augmented lagrangian scheme , the polarization scheme and the accelerated scheme. the last algorithm has caught our attention for its computational efficiency same as in the elastic case ( see @xcite ) when the contrasts of the materials studied are low or high but never infinite , exactly as in the framework described by moulinec and silva in @xcite . in this paper , the authors have compared the different schemes and have proved that the accelerated scheme is the optimal compromise ( except for composite material with infinite contrast ) .    all these algorithms need to be initialized with a reference tensor which depends on the algorithm chosen .",
    "the materials studied here are isotropic with a conductivity tensor of the form @xmath7 ( @xmath8 positive real ) . for the accelerated scheme , according to @xcite and @xcite the constant reference thermal tensor @xmath9 is set to : @xmath10 where c is the contrast between two phases .    in our stochastic approach ,",
    "several generations of samples are considered using same morphological parameters as the numbers and volume fractions of each type of inclusion ( spheres and cylinders ) , the morphology of the cylinders with the aspect ratio ( the ratio between the length and the diameter of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ aspect ] ) ) . with each generated rve , we are able to compute each homogenized conductivity tensor .",
    "we compute the thermal apparent conductivity coefficient as : @xmath11 where :    @xmath12 is the number of rves with the same set of morphological parameters that is the number of runs ,    @xmath13 is the homogenized thermal conductivity tensor for the rve i. + this approach is not new , and to determine how many runs are necessary , the standard deviation of the set of samples is calculated and one can see that 10 ( sometimes 20 ) runs are enough . taking the average , the apparent thermal conductivity denoted by @xmath14 is obtained .",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the results of our numerous computations .",
    "we have varied the morphological parameters ( number of inclusions , volume fraction , aspect ratio , defects , corrugations ) with an adapted range according to the influence observed .",
    "the first results are some tests which allow us to validate the methods , giving expected results .",
    "then , combinations of morphological parameters are tested and give the following results .    in order to compare with the mechanical behaviour",
    ", we use the same rves generated for the mechanical study and for the same reasons mentioned in @xcite , we work with spheres and cylinders that represent globular inclusions and microfibre reinforcements .",
    "we recall here the notations for each generated sample , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the spheres and cylinders volume fraction , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the spheres and cylinders number inside the rve and for a cylinder we need another parameter : the aspect ratio which is the ratio between the length and the diameter of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ aspect ] ) . in the appendix",
    "[ notations ] , a table resumes the notations used and the range for each series of computations .",
    "as explained in @xcite , we have analysed the dependence of effective properties on the number of inclusions with all the other parameters fixed .",
    "we have supposed materials ( matrix and inclusions ) isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "we have observed that off - diagonal terms of the homogenized thermal conductivity tensor approach zero or are not preponderant .",
    "then , the average of the three diagonal terms for each rve is taken for the effective thermal properties and the average for the set of geometries generated with the same parameters is taken to obtain the value of @xmath14 . in general 10 rves have been generated for each set of parameters .",
    "we have represented this value of @xmath14 in the @xmath19 axis on all graphics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the volume faction of cylinders and spheres are equal and allow us to obtain rves with a total volume fraction from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the more interesting results are observed for a large contrast .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that from the number of 20 that is from 20 cylinders and 20 spheres , @xmath14 stabilizes though for higher volume fraction , the effect is more pronounced like for mechanical properties .        in the fig .",
    "[ fig3abis ] , we have drawn the curves for @xmath22 and @xmath23 that is for a total volume fraction equal to @xmath24 and @xmath25 for each case , with curves which show the confidence interval with @xmath26 . fig .",
    "[ fig3abis ] shows that the higher the volume fraction of inclusions is , the higher the dispersion is , and the higher the number of inclusions is , the lower the dispersion is . in the fig .",
    "[ fig3bbis ] , we have drawn the boxplots for each number of inclusion for the case @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the higher the number of inclusions is and more stable the repartition of @xmath14 is .",
    "we can note that from 20 ( 20 cylinders and 20 spheres ) , the range of @xmath14 is also stable .",
    "thus for the further computations , a number of 20 inclusions is considered .     and @xmath23 , contrast = 2048 and aspect ratio = 5 .",
    "]     and aspect ratio = 5 . ]    in the sequel , the study focuses on the influence of morphological parameters .",
    "we describe the trends for @xmath14 versus the parameter studied .",
    "first , we only consider one type of inclusions : spherical inclusions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and next cylindrical inclusions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the trends are similar for 15 , 20 or 25 spheres .",
    "we note that @xmath14 increases non linearly for contrasts greater than 1 and decreases for contrasts smaller than 1 .",
    "we also notice that these effects are more pronounced for contrast greater than 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we observe the same conclusions more enhanced with adding the effect of the aspect ratio .",
    "similar phenomenon had been noticed for the mechanical properties in @xcite .",
    "this subsection is devoted to the influence of morphology on the thermal conductivity .",
    "namely , the influence of morphological parameters ( number , volume fraction , aspect ratio ) on the apparent thermal conductivity is studied .",
    "we have already observed on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that composite materials with cylindrical inclusions have larger apparent thermal conductivity when the aspect ratio is high . for the following tests ,",
    "the number of cylinders has been fixed at 20 and we have studied the influence of both volume fraction of cylinders and their aspect ratio .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we observe the behaviour of composite materials with a mixture of cylindrical and spherical inclusions . the number of each type of inclusions that is 20 spheres and 20 cylinders and the volume fraction being fixed for each computation , we have studied the influence of the aspect ratio .    we observe as in the mechanical case that for contrast greater than 1 , the apparent thermal conductivity of the composite material increases even more with longer cylinders .",
    "moreover , in a composite material with only cylindrical inclusions and contrast greater than 1 , especially for higher contrast , the apparent thermal conductivity reaches higher values than in the case of a mixture of spherical and cylindrical inclusions . for smaller contrast ( i d smaller than 1 )",
    ", we remark that the presence or not of spherical inclusions does not change the apparent thermal conductivity compared to a material with only cylinders whereas we have observed that homogenized mechanical parameters increase in this situation .    for the third series of tests on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we have fixed the volume fraction of each type of inclusions ( spheres and cylinders ) . the aspect ratio of cylinders fixed at 5 , we have studied the influence of both the number of spheres and the number of cylinders .",
    "we can observe that the influence of the number of spheres or cylinders whether for a contrast greater than 1 or less than 1 , is negligible .    in the last series of tests on fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we have studied the influence of volume fraction of spheres and cylinders .",
    "the number of cylinders is fixed at 20 and is equal to the number of spheres .",
    "the aspect ratio of cylinders is also fixed at 5 .",
    "the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] represent the effective thermal conductivity for a fixed sum of the volume fraction and the two types of inclusions .",
    "we observe that the apparent thermal conductivity increases rather than for high volume fraction of cylinders and high contrast .",
    "the last two series of tests represent the case of inclusions with irregular shape .",
    "let us recall that we have developed two algorithms ( @xcite ) able to modify the shape of inclusions which are cylindrical or spherical .",
    "an example of each perturbation is shown in figure [ fig2a ] .",
    "the first case concerns the shape with corrugations and depicts the apparent thermal conductivity versus the wave parameter , i.e. the ratio between the amplitude of perturbations of the surface and the radius of the sphere and the cylinder .",
    "[ fig9 ] exhibits the influence of the wave parameter for several aspect ratios of cylinders ( 3 , 6 and 9 ) and for contrast equal to 2048 .    for smaller contrast , the effect is less apparent , almost no modification is observed .",
    "we can observe that the apparent thermal conductivity of these composite materials increase in comparison to a similar composite material with the same volume fraction of spheres and cylinders and the same aspect ratio .",
    "moreover , we have the similar trends already observed with the mechanical properties .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for composite materials with volume fraction of inclusions higher than @xmath27 and for all aspect ratios tested .",
    "the second series of tests concerns the composite materials with the second variation , an example is also shown on figure [ fig2b ] . for this series of tests",
    ", we have used the same generations of rve but with different defects due to the random aspect of the generation of defects .",
    "nevertheless , we observe the same trends as in the mechanical case ( see @xcite ) that is @xmath14 increases with the volume fraction of defects and with the aspect ratio .",
    "precisely , we represent the results versus the value of volume fraction of defects and for different aspect ratio of cylinder with a contrast equal to 2048 ( for the same reasons as it is mentioned previously ) on fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the higher the fraction of defects is , the higher the apparent thermal conductivity is .",
    "this observation is especially valid for composite materials with larger volume fraction and with cylinders with a large aspect ratio .",
    "we note that the effect observed with this series of test is more significant than the previous series .",
    "in this paper , we have recalled briefly the methods for the rve generation composed by a mixture of spheres and cylinders .",
    "we have presented how adding some irregular shapes for inclusions in these rves .",
    "we have studied how a generated rve which the mechanical behaviour previously studied would behave in a thermal point of view .",
    "our work has been meticulous in order to use the same generated rve .",
    "we have chosen a similar approach to make our computations .",
    "we use the fft - based stochastic homogenization by using the fft - based iterative accelerated scheme to determine effective properties and the stochastic characteristic is obtained with the random generation of several rves with the same fixed parameters .",
    "finally , we observed qualitatively the same trends between the mechanical and the thermal computations .",
    "we can conclude that the morphological parameters influencing the thermal behaviour as the mechanical one are the volume fraction of inclusions and in particular the volume fraction of fibre type inclusions and the morphology of this kind of inclusions .",
    "we also conclude that adding some irregularities ( waves and defects ) improves the thermal behaviour and we have observed the same tendencies between the two series of irregularities tested and the two behaviours : mechanical and thermal .",
    "we also notice at large contrast that the higher is the aspect ratio , the greater is the observed effect .",
    "this work provides a wide range of rve with numerous parameters ( volume fraction of spheres or cylinders , number of spheres or cylinders , morphology of cylinders with their aspect ratio , the irregularities as the shape with corrugations or cuts of inclusions ) . for each",
    "generated rve the mechanical and thermal behaviour with a contrast varying from 0.0625 to 2048 had been computed .",
    "we can imagine that the set of rve generated can be an interesting database for research in inverse problems .",
    "the next step is to use a real composite material given by images generated by tomography and segmented in order to determine its effective thermal and mechanical properties .",
    "one of the objective of this study could be to compare the results obtained with generated rves with results obtained with the tomography images .",
    "another point of our future work should take into account the large images size .",
    "actually , images from tomography can be defined with high resolution ( 2672 @xmath28 2732 pixels per image for example ) and the memory consumption becomes so high that it is not possible to make calculations directly .",
    "we have already made several tests with a sample but due to the high resolution of the images we must resort to a strategy using stochastic method .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "most of the computations described in this paper have been carried out at the cluster of the centre of informatics and numeric applications of normandy ( criaan - centre rgional informatique et dapplications numriques de normandie ) . + this work has been supported by accea project selected by the `` fonds unique interministriel ( fui ) 15 ( 18/03/2013 ) '' program .",

    "2 .   use the series of generated samples ( rves ) of a composite material with the fixed parameters ( stochastic part ) .",
    "3 .   perform accurate computation of effective properties on these rves ( deterministic homogenization part ) .",
    "4 .   average the computed macroscopic characteristics of the samples .",
    "consider a representative volume element @xmath29 with periodic boundary conditions , and denote @xmath30 the temperature , @xmath31 the heat flux and @xmath32 the thermal conductivity at any point @xmath33 .",
    "fourier s law in the linear case states that : @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that we are in stationary phase and without heat source so the heat flux satisfies @xmath35 . notice that for a composite material , the thermal conductivity tensor depends on the point @xmath36 : the dependence is governed by microscopic geometry of the sample , namely which phase ( matrix or inclusion ) the point belongs to .    the volume element @xmath29 is subjected to an average temperature gradient @xmath37 which induces local temperature gradient @xmath38 and heat flux @xmath31 inside the rve .",
    "the effective constitutive relations of the composite material are the relations between the ( spatial ) average flux @xmath39 and average temperature gradient @xmath37 that is : @xmath40 to determine the components of @xmath41 in 3-dimensional space , we need to compute @xmath39 for three independent values of @xmath42 .",
    "there are two approaches to recover @xmath41 : we can construct a mesh of the rve v and use the finite elements method or discretize ( that is pixelize in 2d and voxelize in 3d ) and use the fft - based homogenization scheme ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen the latter method for its capability to take account of complex geometry with some computation reasonable memory although with the first method , we must make fine mesh for some cases of complex geometry which require a lot of memory .",
    "moreover , we suppose the materials isotropic so that we have an exactly expression to the green operator using in the fourier method .",
    "more precisely , it is a common practice to introduce a constant reference tensor @xmath9 to solve the problem of recovering the local fields and gradients . introducing this homogeneous linear tensor and @xmath43 ,",
    "the problems reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the polarization tensor .",
    "+ the solution of ( 1 ) can be expressed in real and fourier spaces , where @xmath46 denotes the fourier image of @xmath47 and @xmath48 s are the coordinates in the fourier space , respectively , with the help of the periodic green operator @xmath49 associated with @xmath9 we also can write : + in real space : @xmath50 or in fourier space : @xmath51 the equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are the lippmann - schwinger integral equations in real and fourier spaces respectively .",
    "the green operator @xmath52 is easily expressed and computed in the fourier space by : @xmath53    the lippmann - schwinger equation can be solved iteratively using the algorithm based on the accelerated scheme proposed by eyre and milton in @xcite and written as algorithm 3 in @xcite for the elastic case ( see appendix [ algo ] ) .",
