    "the problem of computing the sum of a borel - resummable divergent series expansion has already a long history , which traces back to the stokes s epoch marking paper @xcite where an analogous of the summation to the least term ( the `` mthode des astronomes '' of poincar @xcite ) play a key argument .",
    "various methods have been developed since then , most of them being justified in the framework of the gevrey theory @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "one of them , which will be used in this paper , is the resummation by factorial series @xcite and its recent extension @xcite .    in most applications ,",
    "the borel resummable divergent series expansion enjoys the property of being resurgent @xcite . in this case",
    "the borel sum can be calculated by the hyperasymptotic theory @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this method has been demonstrated in various problems @xcite .",
    "+ these problems ( mutiple integrals , linear and nonlinear ode s , difference equations , pde s , ... ) have a common feature : the resurgent properties of the divergent series to be resummed , that is , roughly speaking , the riemann sheet structure of its borel transform , is basically governed by a the so - called `` formal integral '' which can be derived directly from the problem .",
    "this means that the various series expansions playing a role in the hyperasymptotics are known , up to the stokes multipliers which have ( and can be ) computed in the hyperasymptotic scheme .",
    "this certainly explain why up to now no general links have been written between resurgence and hyperasymptotic theories .",
    "the main goal of this self - contained article is precisely to provide the relationships between the resurgence and hyperasymptotic theories .",
    "this will be done by the way of an example .",
    "we shall examine the effective resummation of a divergent series defined implicitly , so that no formal integral is computable .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see , the resurgent structure can be described through general tools from resurgent theory , and this allows hyperasymptotic expansions .",
    "we shall be interested here in a celebrated test problem , the calculation of the zeros of the airy function @xmath0 in @xcite , berry and howls have already shown how the hyperasymptotics can be used to solve this problem , their method being based on the hyperasymptotics of the airy function itself .",
    "our approach differs from theirs and resembles ( and by the way justify ) the idea of stokes @xcite who first translates the problem into a simpler implicit resurgent - resummable equation and formally solve it .",
    "this can be rigorously justified in the framework of resurgence analysis , leading to the notion of `` model equation '' through a resurgent - resummable change of variable ( this is a key - idea in many problems , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this will be done in ",
    "[ section2 ] . what remains to do then is to borel - sum the change of variable . for that purpose",
    "we first use , in  [ section3 ] , the direct method by factorial series as explained in @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the hyperasymptotics in ",
    "[ section5 ] .",
    "however , to apply this second method we first have to analyze the resurgent properties of our implicitly defined formal series .",
    "this is what we do in ",
    "[ section4 ] . using the alien differential calculus",
    ", it can be derived that the riemann sheet structure of the borel transform is analogous to that of a solution of a nonlinear differential equation , a riccati equation for instance @xcite , with a one - dimensional lattice of singularities .",
    "this means that our method can be adapted to a large class of problems , for instance to the so - called exact bohr - sommerfeld equations @xcite which are nowadays quite common in physics .",
    "in this article , if @xmath1 is a set of points in @xmath2 with no accumulation point , we note :    * @xmath3 and @xmath4 its universal covering . * for @xmath5 small enough we write @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the close disc centered on @xmath8 with radius @xmath9 , and @xmath10 its universal covering . * for @xmath11 ( _ resp . _",
    "@xmath12 ) we write @xmath13 $ ] :    * its _ minor _ is defined as @xmath14 , that is its formal borel transform when forgetting its constant term @xmath15 .",
    "* one says that @xmath16 is a _ small _ formal series expansion if @xmath17 .",
    "* @xmath18 is said to be gevrey-1 , and we note @xmath19_1 $ ] , if its minor @xmath20 converges at the origin .",
    "it is known since stokes that the asymptotics of the airy function is essentially governed by the series expansion @xmath21 this series expansion is divergent but enjoys the following properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :      this proposition implies that for any @xmath28 , the function @xmath29 is a well - defined holomorphic function in @xmath30 : @xmath31 is _ borel - resummable in the direction @xmath32 _ and @xmath33 is its _ borel - sum _ in that direction whose asymptotics is given by @xmath31 : proposition [ propvarphiai ] and a theorem of nevanlinna @xcite induce for instance that , for any @xmath28 , there exists @xmath34 such that , for any @xmath25 , @xmath35 the link between @xmath31 and the airy function is given by the following proposition @xcite :      ( here and in the sequel we use the convention that @xmath41 one just has , by cauchy , to rotate the direction of summation @xmath32 in ( [ somborelai ] ) . for @xmath42 one thus gets : + for @xmath43 , @xmath37 , _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath44 , @xmath39 , @xmath45      a stokes phenomenon occurs for the @xmath46 direction , since in that direction one meets a singularity for @xmath47 : @xmath48 is not borel - resummable in that direction , but _",
    "right and left borel - resummable_. for the right - resummation @xmath49 one integrates along a path avoiding the singularity as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : figart2 ] .",
    "the left - resummation @xmath50 is defined in a similar way .        from a theoretical viewpoint it is possible to perform higher hyperasymptotics .",
    "this requires to go deeper in the resurgent structure of @xmath51 .",
    "the method is just like what we have done in ",
    "[ resforx ] , even if the alien calculus becomes somewhat complicated . for the hyperasymptotics part ,",
    "the existence of collinear singularities induce the need of great care in choosing the correct branches of the hyperterminants ( in relation with ( [ hypertright ] ) ) .",
    "but , according to the specialists , this problem can be mastered ( see @xcite ) .                                                    c. j. howls , a. b. olde daalhuis , _ hyperasymptotic solutions of inhomogeneous linear differential equations with a singularity of rank one . _",
