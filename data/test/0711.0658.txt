    "one of the most important aspects of string theory with potential applications to beyond - the - standard - model physics and cosmology is the existence of additional extended objects .",
    "a particularly interesting class of these , @xmath2-branes , occur as @xmath3-dimensional surfaces arising as supersymmetric solutions of the low - energy supergravity field equations but have also a high - energy interpretation as surfaces confining the endpoints of open strings @xcite . by now many different configurations of @xmath2-branes",
    "have been studied , including parallel and intersecting sets of branes @xcite , the combination of branes with different dimensionalities @xcite and also several possible embeddings in the compactified extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "these models have an enormous potential in the construction of gauge theories with matter and several new extensions of the standard model have been obtained in this way @xcite .",
    "branes have also been intensively studied in their application to the problems of early universe cosmology , such as inflation and reheating . in the context of effective field theory treatments of brane - world model building , an immense amount of work has been performed on the astrophysical and cosmological implications of these theories for both flat and warped extra dimensions @xcite , while many studies in string theory have also been undertaken @xcite .",
    "one important property of @xmath2-branes is the fact that they interact at large distances via the exchange of closed string modes , which allows one to study them as massive point - like charged objects moving along the dimensions transverse to their world - volumes",
    ". an interesting application of this was proposed in @xcite , where it was shown that branes with opposite charges may form bound states similar to electron - positron states , despite the different origin of the central potentials involved .",
    "this analogy has motivated the name of _ branonium _ to designate this type of systems .",
    "several properties of these bound states have been analyzed in @xcite , including the classical orbits , the associated quantum dynamics and possible compactification schemes .",
    "this analysis assumed a probe ( anti)brane moving in the background spacetime created by a fixed central stack of branes , thus neglecting the gravitational backreaction of the probe . in the case of @xmath1-branes ,",
    "the probe s trajectory follows closed elliptical orbits similar to those found in planetary systems .",
    "it was also suggested that the probe s motion would lead to radiation of particles into both the bulk space and the probe s world - volume , making otherwise stable orbits decay .",
    "the stability of this system was further studied in @xcite , where it was shown that orbital decay necessarily occurs when geometric moduli of the background spacetime are allowed to vary .    in this work ,",
    "we explore some properties of branonium systems , namely the mechanism leading to particle production in the world - volume of the probe brane . for the particular case of a scalar field living in the world - volume of a probe @xmath1-brane",
    ", we show that particle production may occur in a regime of parametric resonance similar to the one behind the phenomenon of preheating after inflation @xcite , leading to an exponential growth of the particle number in the probe s world - volume .",
    "we determine how the orbital parameters of the system constrain this mechanism and analyze the possible properties of the resonantly produced particles .",
    "also , we study how the probe s trajectory is modified by compactifying three of the dimensions parallel to the branes , so that a 4-dimensional spacetime with a flat friedmann - robertson - walker geometry is obtained . in this case",
    ", we analyze the effects of hubble expansion on the orbital parameters and how it modifies the parametric resonance regime .",
    "other instability sources such as radiation into bulk modes are discussed as well .",
    "we also consider the effects of transverse space compactification on the probe s motion in the case of a compact 3-torus and analyze the associated production of angular momentum .",
    "finally , we explore some of the cosmological applications of the resonant particle production mechanism and relate them to possible final configurations of the system , including stable states or brane - antibrane annihilation .    in the next section ,",
    "we begin by introducing some of the general properties of @xmath4 branonia , with particular emphasis on the @xmath5 case , and discuss the effects of hubble expansion on the orbital parameters . in section iii , we study the evolution of scalar particle - modes confined to the probe brane and analyze the properties of the associated parametric resonance mechanism in both the non - expanding and expanding universe cases .",
    "we distinguish between the production of massless and massive particles and determine the significance of energy damping into these modes on the probe s motion .",
    "we also consider , in this section , the effects of radiation into bulk modes on the resonant production of brane - bound particles . in section iv , we analyze how compactifying the directions transverse to the branes modifies the probe s trajectory and dynamically generates the required angular momentum .",
    "possible final states of the system are described in section v , where we also analyze the relevance of the particle production mechanism to cosmology in some particular scenarios .",
    "we summarize the main results and conclusions of this work in section vi .",
    "branonium corresponds , in its simplest form proposed in @xcite , to a system whose components are a fixed stack of @xmath6 parallel @xmath7-branes and a probe @xmath7-brane , parallel to the stack , whose gravitational backreaction is neglected so that it has no influence on the geometry of the background spacetime .",
    "let the coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 , correspond to the dimensions parallel to the stack and the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , correspond to those transverse to the branes .",

    "this approximation is valid as long as the local string coupling , @xmath41 , is everywhere small .",
    "also , we need to require the radial coordinate @xmath42 , which will give the distance between the probe and the stack branes , to be large compared to the string length @xmath39 , so that mediation by supergravity bulk fields ( graviton , dilaton and rr - forms ) is the dominant source of brane interactions .    before analyzing the motion of the probe brane , we need to consider possible compactifications of the 10 dimensional spacetime that yield our 4-dimensional world at low energies .",

    "the dilaton field @xmath13 is not altered by this compactification , while the @xmath46-form rr field can be decomposed as follows : [ eq8 ] c_[n-1]=b_[n-1]+b_[n-2]dz  .",
    "we take the following truncation of these fields : [ eq9 ] b_[n-1]=0  , ( b_[n-2])_01p-1=(1-h^-1 )  .",
    "this truncation leads to a @xmath47-brane supergravity solution in @xmath48 dimensions , characterized by the same harmonic function of the transverse space radial coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "applying this _ toroidal compactification _",
    "procedure @xmath49 times we obtain @xmath50-brane solutions living in a @xmath51-dimensional spacetime , with the number of transverse dimensions remaining the same .",
    "the process of compactifying the dimensions transverse to the branes is not as straightforward due to the lack of translational invariance which results from the presence of the branes .",
    "in particular , to make a given transverse coordinate @xmath52 periodic , so that a similar kaluza - klein mechanism can be applied , one needs to include the appropriate  image branes \" of the source branes which will ensure the invariance of the configuration under @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the radius of the compact dimension .",
    "for example , if a source brane is located at @xmath55 , an image brane has to be considered at @xmath56 .",
    "this implies a generalization of the harmonic function in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) to include branes located at different points in transverse space @xcite : [ eq10 ] h()=1+_iq_p|-|^  , where the vectors @xmath57 denote the positions of the different image branes and @xmath58 .",
    "these two compactification schemes allow us to reduce a 10-dimensional solution of the supergravity field equations to a 4-dimensional spacetime which resembles our world .",
    "we will be interested in studying a particular case of the general branonium configuration described so far where we have a source stack of d6-branes and also a probe @xmath1 brane . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "when the probe carries an antibrane charge , i.e. opposite to the charge of the source branes , the system yields closed elliptical orbits which can be solved analytically , while for other values of @xmath36 the orbits fail to close .",
    "this feature has , as we will describe later on , important consequences for particle production in the world - volume of the probe .",
    "compactifying 3 of the dimensions parallel to the branes , we obtain effective d3-branes moving in a 3-dimensional transverse space , the shape of the orbits not being affected by this toroidal compactification scheme as mentioned before .",
    "if the transverse dimensions are finite but their typical size is much larger than that of the compact parallel dimensions and the interbrane distance , we may consider them to be infinite and neglect the brane images described before .",
    "although this would correspond to a 7-dimensional spacetime , from the point of view of fields confined to the world - volume of the source and probe branes it is effectively 4-dimensional .",
    "the dynamics in the transverse space will , nevertheless , affect the 4-dimensional dynamics of the fields .    in order to make the system more similar to the observable universe",
    ", we consider a modification of the solution eq .",
    "( 1 ) so that , after compactification of 3 of the parallel dimensions , the 4-dimensional world - volume of the branes has a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry .",
    "this is a particular case of the the system studied in @xcite , where the moduli governing the size of both parallel and transverse dimensions were allowed to vary . in this work , we will assume that some dynamical mechanism at the string scale ( see , e.g. @xcite ) or at some other high - energy scale ( such as susy breaking ) fixes all moduli except the scale factor associated with the 3 non - compact dimensions parallel to the branes .",
    "hence , in the einstein frame , the complete 7-dimensional line element is given by : [ eq11 ] ds_7 ^ 2=h^-_4[-dt^2+a^2_ijdx^idx^j]+h^_4_mndy^mdy^n  , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) for the compactification on a 3-torus , but their precise values will not be necessary in the subsequent calculations .",
    "the motion of the probe brane is described by its action , which is divided in two parts .",
    "the born - infeld contribution , which concerns the geometry of the world volume and possible gauge fields living on it , is in the string frame given by , for a generic @xmath7-brane probe @xcite : [ eq12 ] s_bi =- t_pd^p+1  e^-  , where @xmath65 are world - volume coordinates , @xmath66 gives the @xmath7-brane tension and @xmath67 is the induced metric on the probe .",
    "the hatted metric tensor is defined in the string frame , and is related to the einstein frame one via @xmath68 with @xmath69 in the general case .",
    "the antisymmetric field strength tensor @xmath70 refers to gauge fields describing open string modes with endpoints on the probe ( in the case of dirichlet branes ) , but in what follows we will set these fields to zero .",
    "the wess - zumino part of the action describes the minimal coupling of the ramond - ramond @xmath3-form to the @xmath3-world volume of the probe brane and can be written as @xcite : [ eq13 ] s_wz =- qt_pc_[p+1 ]  .",
    "the constant @xmath71 gives the sign of the charge of the probe brane , which being a bps saturated state is equal or opposite to the brane tension @xmath66 , so that @xmath72 corresponds to a brane and @xmath73 corresponds to an antibrane @xcite .",
    "if we now consider the particular case of d6 branes in 10 dimensions , compactifying 3 of the parallel dimensions and including the scale factor describing the expansion ( or contraction ) of the 3 remaining non - compact dimensions along the brane , and choose the world - volume coordinates such that @xmath74 , we arrive at the following expression for the total action of the probe brane : [ eq14 ] s_4=-t_6v_3d^4x  a^3(t )  , where @xmath75 gives the volume of the compact 3-torus around which the d6-branes are wrapped to give the effective 4-dimensional space .",
    "we have assumed that the transverse space coordinates are exclusively time - dependent , @xmath76 and defined the velocity of the probe as @xmath77 , with dots denoting time derivatives .",
    "as mentioned before , the bound orbits of the probe brane can be exactly solved for the case where the scale factor is constant and it was shown in @xcite that they correspond to closed ellipses .",
    "we now wish to analyze the effects of the varying scale factor on these orbits . in this case , a full analytical solution is hard to obtain and it is simpler to consider the evolution of the system when the probe brane moves at larges distances from the stack with small velocities .",
    "these two conditions can be expressed as @xmath78 .",
    "one must recall that we considered initially that the transverse dimensions can be considered infinite in extent .",
    "hence , our analysis will hold as long as the radial coordinate is large compared to the typical length scale of the harmonic function , given by @xmath79 ( assumed larger than the string scale and the compactification scale ) , but still much smaller than the typical size of the transverse dimensions ( assumed much larger than @xmath79 ) . with this hierarchy in mind",
    ", we may expand the probe brane s action to obtain , to lowest order , [ eq15 ] s_4-t_6v_3d^4x  a^3(t )  .",
    "our subsequent analysis will not be affected by the constant term and we may drop it . for a probe antibrane , [ eq16 ] s_4t_6v_3d^4x  a^3(t )  .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the problem implies that the probe s trajectory will be confined to a plane , which we may choose to be @xmath80 .",
    "then , we may define the canonically normalized complex scalar field [ eq17 ] ( y^1+iy^2 )  , so that its action is , in the non - relativistic and large distance limit , [ eq18 ] s_=d^4x  a^3(t)(-g^__^*-v ( ) )  , where @xmath81 is the 4-dimensional flat frw metric of the spacetime where the field is defined and the potential is given by : [ eq19 ] v()=2t_6v_3h^-12t_6v_3(1- )  , so that it only depends on @xmath82 .",
    "note that in writing the action in this form one must take into account that the spatial derivatives of the field , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , are assumed to vanish , i.e. the probe brane should remain parallel to the source branes during its motion .",
    "the analysis of the classical motion of the probe brane is in this way reexpressed as a classical field theory problem of a complex scalar field in the background of a flat frw spacetime . before deriving the equations of motion for the field @xmath85 ,",
    "it is useful to consider some of the symmetries of the action .",
    "first , the rotational symmetry of the problem in the plane transverse to the branes is associated with a conserved angular momentum . in terms of the field theory approach",
    ", this corresponds to the global u(1 ) invariance of the action under @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a constant .",
    "the associated noether current induces a conserved charge which gives , in the quantum theory , the particle number operator associated with the field .",
    "writing the field as @xmath88 and defining the comoving angular momentum as @xmath89 , the comoving particle number density is given by : [ eq20 ] n = i(^*-^*)=2 ^ 2=2l  , while the total particle number , which corresponds to the conserved noether charge , is given by @xmath90 .",

    "( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) we conclude that @xmath95 , the equality holding only for @xmath96 .",

    "the angular momentum evolves according to : [ eq23 ] dldt+3hl=0  , which corresponds to conservation of the total particle number @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in an expanding universe , the absolute value of the angular momentum will necessarily decrease , vanishing asymptotically .",
    "we , thus , conclude from this simple analysis of conservation laws that the expansion of the universe will make the system reduce both its energy density and its angular momentum . to analyze the details of this evolution , we need to determine the equations of motion for the field @xmath85 . varying the action eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) with respect to @xmath98 , and taking this variation to vanish , we obtain : [ eq24 ] + 3h+v(||)^*=0  . in terms of the transverse space coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath99 , this can be written as : [ eq25 ] y^m+3hy^m+2q_6y^mr^3=0  .",

    "the possibility that this scalar field may drive ( slow - roll ) inflation if , in the early universe , it dominates the energy density has been analyzed in @xcite , for the case where the probe brane moves in a linear trajectory , i.e. @xmath103 .",

    "this is intrinsically related to the assumption that @xmath42 is much smaller than the size of the transverse dimensions .",
    "an inflationary period driven by the angular field variable @xmath101 was proposed in @xcite , where it is argued that , despite having a flat potential , this field may provide the constant energy density necessary for inflation if the probe brane moves in a circular orbit with @xmath105 . however , we need to take into account the fact that , during inflation , the angular momentum decays exponentially as @xmath106 , from eq .",
