    "according to the schrdinger formulation of quantum mechanics , a total eigenfunction provides implicitly all relevant information about the behaviour of a physical system .",
    "thus , if it is exactly solvable for a given potential , an obtained eigenfunction can be used to describe such a system completely .",
    "this has made the exact solutions of quantum systems be an important subject and also attract much attention in the development of quantum mechanics [ 1 - 25 ] .    up to now ,",
    "there have been several efficient methodology developed to find the exact solutions of quantum systems within the framework of the non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanical wave equations .",
    "few of these methods include the feynman integral formalism @xcite , asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) [ 1 - 5,17 - 21 ] , functional analysis approach @xcite , exact quantization rule method @xcite , proper quantization rule @xcite , nikiforov - uvarov ( nu ) method @xcite , supersymetric quantum mechanics @xcite , etc .",
    "very recently , ma and xu have proposed an exact ( improved ) quantization rule and applied it to calculate the energy levels of some exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems . these include the finite square well , the morse , the symmetric and the symmetric and asymmetric rosen - morse , the harmonic oscillator , the first and second pschl - teller potentials @xcite . by using this same rule , dong and co - researchers @xcite have obtained the analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation for the deformed harmonic oscillator in one dimension , the kratzer potential and pseudoharmonic oscillator in three dimensions .",
    "the energy levels of all the bound states are easily calculated from this quantization rule .",
    "the priority purpose of the present work is to obtain the obtain the bound state solution of deng - fan diatomic potential model via this quantization rule .",
    "the deng - fan diatomic potential model also known as the generalized morse potential which was proposed some decades ago by deng and fan @xcite .",
    "this is done in an attempt to finding a more suitable diatomic potential to describe the vibrational spectrum , qualitatively similar to the morse potential with the correct asymptotic behaviour as the inter - nuclear distance approaches zero .",
    "this potential model can be used to describe the motion of the nucleons in the mean field produced by the interactions between nuclei @xcite .",
    "this potential has been used to describe diatomic molecular energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions and it is an ideal inter - nuclear potential in diatomic molecules with the same behavior for @xmath1 . because of its importance in chemical physics , molecular spectroscopy , molecular physics and related areas , the bound state solutions of the relativistic and non - relativistic wave equations",
    "have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the shape of this potential with respect to some diatomic molecules is shown in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly introduced the exact quantization rule . in section 3",
    ", we apply this quantization rule to obtain the bound state solutions of the deng - fan molecular potential .",
    "section 4 present the numerical results and finally and a brief conclusion .",
    "in this section , the brief review of this quantization rule is given .",
    "the details can be found in refs @xcite . it is well known that in one dimension , schrdinger equation @xmath2\\psi(x)=0 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ]",
    "can be written in the following form @xmath3 } , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the logarithmic derivative of the wave function @xmath5 , the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the variable x , @xmath6 denotes the reduced mass of the two interacting particles , @xmath7 is the momentum and @xmath8 is a piecewise continuous real potential function of @xmath9 . for the schrdinger equation ,",
    "the phase angle is the logarithmic derivative @xmath10 . from equation ( [ e2 ] ) , as @xmath9 increases across a node of wave function @xmath5 , @xmath10 decreases to @xmath11 , jumps to @xmath12 and then decreases again .    in the recent years",
    ", ma and xu @xcite generalized this exact quantization rule to the 3d radial schrdinger equation with spherically symmetric potential by simply making the replacements @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15\\left[\\frac{d\\phi(r)}{dr}\\right]^{-1},\\ \\ \\ \\ k(r)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2}[e - v_{eff}(r ) ] } .",
    "\\label{e3}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two turning points determined by @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 is the number of the nodes of @xmath20 in the region @xmath21 and is larger by one than the number @xmath22 of the nodes of wave function @xmath23 .",
    "the first term @xmath24 is the contribution from the nodes of the logarithmic derivative of wave function , and the second is called the quantum correction .",
    "it is found that for all well - known exactly solvable quantum systems , this quantum correction is independent of the number of nodes of wave function .",
    "this means that it is enough to consider the ground state in calculating the quantum correction , i.e. @xmath25 in the recent years , this quantization rule has been used in many physical systems to obtain the exact solutions of many exactly solvable quantum systems @xcite",
    "in this section , we apply the exact quantization to study the ro - vibrational energy states of some diatomic molecules .",
    "to begin , we write schrodinger equation with the deng - fan diatomic molecular potential as @xmath26r_{n\\ell}(r)=0 , \\label{e5}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath27 denote the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath28 is the internuclear separation of the diatomic molecules , and @xmath29 is the bound - state energy eigenvalues .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath30 represent the reduced mass and interaction potential respectively .",
    "it is well - known that the equation of form ( [ e5 ] ) is an exactly solvable problem for s - wave . but for @xmath31wave states , the problem is not analytically solvable . to obtain the bound state solutions",
    ", we must therefore resort to using an approximation similar to other works @xcite to deal with the centrifugal term or alternatively , to solve numerically .",
    "it is noted that , for short potential range , the following formula is a good approximation to the centrifugal term : @xmath32 , \\label{e6}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 . it should be noted that this approximation reduce to the one used by dong and gu @xcite , dong et al @xcite , and qiang and dong @xcite when @xmath34 .",
    "now if we consider the approximation ( [ e6 ] ) and equation ( [ e5 ] ) , we can find the effective potential as @xmath35 where we have introduced a new transformation of the form @xmath36 .",
    "now , let us begin the application of the quantization rule to study the potential @xmath37 . to perform this task , we have to first calculate the turning points @xmath38 and @xmath39 determined by solving @xmath40 .",
    "thus we have @xmath41^{1/2 } \\label{e8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the momentum between the two turning points @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have also introduced three parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for mathematical simplicity .",
    "these parameters are as follows : @xmath46 the non linear riccati equation for the ground state is written in terms of the new variable @xmath47 as @xmath48\\phi_0(\\varrho)=0 .",
    "\\label{e10}\\ ] ] thus , since the logarithmic derivative @xmath49 for the ground state has one zero and no pole , therefore we assume the following solution for the ground states @xmath50 on substituting equation ( [ e11 ] ) into ( [ e10 ] ) and then solve the non - linear riccati equation , we obtain the ground state energy as @xmath51 also , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are as follows : @xmath54 it is worth to be noted that we only choose the positive sign in front of the square root for @xmath53 .",
    "this is because the logarithmic derivative @xmath49 will decrease exponentially , which is required physically .",
    "let us now calculate the quantum correction .",
    "for this purpose , we utilize the integrals given by appendix a , and we obtain @xmath55\\varrho\\left[\\varrho-\\left(\\frac{\\varrho_a+\\varrho_b}{2}\\right)\\right]d\\varrho}{\\mathcal{b}\\varrho(1+\\varrho)\\sqrt{(\\varrho_a-\\varrho)(\\varrho-\\varrho _ b)}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu r}{\\hbar^2}}\\int_{\\varrho_a}^{\\varrho_b}\\frac{d\\varrho}{\\sqrt{(\\varrho_a-\\varrho)(\\varrho-\\varrho _ b)}}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{a}}{\\mathcal{b}}-1\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\varrho_a+\\varrho_b}{2}+1\\right)}{1+\\varrho}-\\frac{\\frac{\\mathcal{a}}{\\mathcal{b}}\\left(\\frac{\\varrho_a+\\varrho_b}{2}\\right)}{\\varrho}+1\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu r}{\\hbar^2}}\\left[1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu r}}{\\mathcal{b}\\hbar}\\right].\\label{e14 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , the integral of the momentum @xmath56 can be found as follows : @xmath57\\label{e15}\\\\ & = & -\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{r - q+p - e_{n\\ell}}{r}}-1-\\sqrt{\\frac{p - e_{n\\ell}}{r}}\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used an appropriate standard integral in the appendix a. now by combining the results obtained by equations ( [ e14 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) with equation equation ( [ e3 ] ) , i.e. @xmath58=n\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu r}{\\hbar^2}}\\left[1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu r}}{\\mathcal{b}\\hbar}\\right ] , \\label{e16}\\ ] ] the energy eigenvalues spectrum can then be found as @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{e17}\\ ] ] let us now obtain the corresponding wave function for this system .",
    "for this purpose , we introduced a new transformation of the form @xmath60 @xmath61 in equation ( [ e5 ] ) which maintained the finiteness of the transformed wave functions on the boundary conditions we have @xmath62 furthermore , equation ( [ ee18 ] ) is transformed into a more convenient second - order homogeneous linear differential equation via the following transformation @xmath63 substituting of equation ( [ e19 ] ) into equation ( [ ee18 ] ) , we can find @xmath64+g_{n\\ell}(z)\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{b}}{\\alpha}+p\\right)^2+u}{z(1-z)}\\right]=0 . \\label{e20}\\ ] ] the solution to the above second order differential equation can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function as : @xmath65 the following notations : @xmath66 has been introduced in equation ( [ e21 ] ) so as to avoid mathematical complexity . by considering the finiteness of the solutions , @xmath67 approaches infinity unless @xmath68 is a negative integer .",
    "this is an indication that @xmath67 will not be finite everywhere unless we take @xmath69 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 given by equation ( [ e22 ] ) can be re - written in terms of this condition , and finally we can write the wave function as @xmath71 @xmath72 is the normalization constant .",
    "by using the known spectroscopic values in table [ tab1 ] we obtain the energy states of few selected diatomic molecules for various vibrational @xmath22 and rotational @xmath27 angular momentum as shown in tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] .",
    "these diatomic molecules are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters are taken from the work of kunc - gordillo - vazquez @xcite and oyewumi et al .",
    "we also applied following conversion @xmath78 with @xmath79 throughout our numerical computation .    in order to test the accuracy of our results ,",
    "we give a numerical comparison of our obtained energy spectrum with the ones @xmath73 and @xmath74 obtained previously in the literature , for the shifted deng - fan potential ( i.e. deng - fan potential shifted by the dissociation energy @xmath80 ) . as it can been seen from table [ tab2 ]",
    "our approximate results are in excellent agreement with the ones obtained previously by other authors and via other approach .",
    "we also proceed furthermore to obtain the ro - vibrational energy spectrum ( in @xmath81 units ) for the 5 selected diatomic molecules .",
    "it is worth to be noted that the advantage of the method presented in this study is that , for exactly solvable quantum system , it enable one to find the energy spectrum directly in a simple way .",
    "finally , we recommend that the extension of this method to obtain the bound state solution some other potentials such as : wood - saxon potential , yukawa potential , hellmann potential , etc .",
