    "modern atomic spectroscopy studies the structure and properties of practically any atom of the periodic table as well as of ions of any ionization degree .",
    "particular attention is paid to their energy spectra . for the investigations of many - electron atoms and ions ,",
    "it is of great importance to combine experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "nowadays the possibilities of theoretical spectroscopy are much enlarged thanks to the wide use of powerful computers .",
    "theoretical methods utilized must be fairly universal and must ensure reasonably accurate values of physical quantities studied .",
    "many - electron atom usually is considered as many - body problem and is described by the wave function constructed from the wave functions of one electron , moving in the central nuclear charge field and in the screening field of the remaining electrons",
    ". then the wave function of this electron may be represented as a product of radial and spin - angular parts .",
    "the radial part is usually found by solving various modifications of the hartree - fock equations and can be represented in a numerical or analytical forms ( froese fischer  @xcite ) whereas the angular part is expressed in terms of spherical functions .",
    "then the wave function of the whole atom can be constructed in some standard way ( cowan  @xcite , jucys and savukynas  @xcite , nikitin and rudzikas  @xcite ) starting with these one - electron functions and may be used further on for the calculations of any matrix elements representing physical quantities .    for obtaining the values of atomic quantities",
    "it is necessary to solve so - called eigenvalue problem    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the wave function of the system under investigation and @xmath3 is its hamiltonian . in order to obtain accurate values of atomic quantities",
    "it is necessary to account for relativistic and correlation effects .",
    "it turned out that for very large variety of atoms and their ionization degrees the relativistic effects may be taken into account fairly accurately as breit - pauli corrections ( nikitin and rudzikas  @xcite , rudzikas  @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to present the hamiltonian as consisting of two parts in breit - pauli approach , namely ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the non - relativistic hamiltonian and @xmath6 stands for the relativistic contibution .",
    "non - relativistic hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic energy of electrons @xmath7 , their potential energy @xmath8 , and the electrostatic electron interaction @xmath9    @xmath10    the first two terms , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the one - particle operators , whereas the third term , @xmath9 , is two - particle operator .",
    "the @xmath6 may also be subdivided into non - fine structure and fine structure contributions    @xmath11    the non - fine structure contributions    @xmath12    shift non - relativistic energy levels without any splitting of them . the mass - velocity term",
    "@xmath13 describes the variation of mass with velocity .",
    "the one- and two - body darwin ( contact ) terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corrections of the one - electron dirac equation due to the retardation of the electromagnetic field produced by an electron ( contact interaction ) .",
    "the spin - spin - contact term @xmath16 accounts for the interaction of the spin magnetic moments of two electrons occupying the same space .",
    "the orbit - orbit interaction @xmath17 accounts for the interaction of two orbital moments .",
    "the fine - structure contributions    @xmath18    split the non - relativistic energy levels ( terms ) into a series of closely - spaced levels .",
    "the most important of these is the nuclear spin - orbit interaction @xmath19 ( spin - own - orbit ) representing the interaction of the spin and angular magnetic moments of an electron in the field of the nucleus .",
    "the spin - other - orbit @xmath20 and spin - spin @xmath21 contributions in a rough sense may be viewed as corrections to the nuclear spin - orbit interaction due to the presence of the other electrons in the system .",
    "unfortunately , practical calculations show that all realistic atomic hamiltonians do not lead straightforwardly to eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "actually we have to calculate all non - zero matrix elements of the hamiltonian considered including those non - diagonal with respect to electronic configurations , then to form energy matrix , to diagonalize it , obtaining in this way the values of the energy levels as well as the eigenfunctions ( the wave functions in the intermediate coupling scheme ) .",
    "the latter may be used then to calculate electronic transitions as well as the other properties and processes .",
    "such a necessity raises special requirements for the theory .",
    "the total matrix element of each term of the energy operator in the case of complex electronic configuration will consist of matrix elements , describing the interaction inside each shell of equivalent electrons as well as between these shells . going beyond the single - configuration approximation we have to be able to take into account in the same way non - diagonal , with respect to configurations , matrix elements .    to find",
    "the expressions for the matrix elements of all terms of the hamiltonian considered for complex electronic configurations , having several open shells , is a task very far from the trivial one .",
    "a considerable part of the effort must be devoted to coping with integrations over spin - angular variables , occurring in the matrix elements of the operators under consideration .",
    "this paper presents the general methodology , leading to optimal expressions for operators and matrix elements .",
    "a number of methodologies to calculate the angular parts of matrix elements exists in literature .",
    "many existing codes for integrating the spin - angular parts of matrix elements ( glass  @xcite , glass and hibbert  @xcite , grant  @xcite , burke _",
    "@xcite ) are based on the computational scheme proposed by fano  @xcite .",
    "this methodology is based on having the total wavefunction of an atom built from the antisymmetrized wavefunctions of separate shells , and this antisymmetrization is done via coefficients of fractional parentage .",
    "the shells are coupled one to another via their angular momenta .",
    "so , the finding of matrix elements amounts to finding the recoupling matrices and the coefficients of fractional parentage .",
    "suppose that we have a bra function with @xmath22 shells in @xmath0 coupling : @xmath23{c } \\psi _ u^{bra}\\left ( lsm_lm_s\\right ) \\equiv \\\\ \\equiv ( n_1l_1n_2l_2 ... n_ul_u\\alpha _ 1l_1s_1\\alpha _ 2l_2s_2 ... \\alpha _ ul_us_u{\\cal a}lsm_lm_s| \\end{array}\\ ] ] and a ket function : @xmath24{c } \\psi _ u^{ket}\\left ( l^{\\prime } s^{\\prime } m^{\\prime}_lm^{\\prime}_s\\right ) \\equiv \\\\",

    "jucys and vizbarait .",
    "e  @xcite proposed to use the two - electron coefficients of fractioanl parentage instead of ordinary ones , in matrix elements calculations , but even that did not solve the abovementioned problems . a solution to this problem",
    "was found by burke _",
    "they tabulated separate standard parts of recoupling matrices along with coefficients of fractional parentage at the beginning of a calculation and used them further on to calculate the needed coefficients .",

    "@xcite utilize the program njsym ( burke  @xcite ) or njgraf ( bar - shalom and klapisch  @xcite ) for the calculation of recoupling matrices .",
    "both are rather time consuming when calculating matrix elements of complex operators or electronic configurations with many open shells .    in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "cowan  @xcite suggested that matrix elements be grouped into  classes ",
    "( see cowan  @xcite figure 13 - 5 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this approach was not generalized to all two - electron operators . perhaps for this reason",
    "cowan s approach is not very popular although the program itself , based on this approach , is widely used .",
    "many approaches for the calculation of spin - angular coefficients ( glass  @xcite , glass and hibbert  @xcite , grant  @xcite , burke _ et al _",
    "@xcite ) are based on the usage of racah algebra only on the level of coefficients of fractional parentage .",
    "a few authors ( jucys and savukynas  @xcite , cowan  @xcite ) utilize the unit tensors , simplifying the calculations in this way , because use can be made of the tables of unit tensors and selection rules can be used prior to computation to check whether the spin - angular coefficients are zero or not .",
    "moreover , the recoupling matrices themselves have a simpler form .",
    "unfortunately , these ideas were applied only to diagonal matrix elements with respect to configurations , though cowan  @xcite suggested the usage of unit tensors for non - diagonal ones as well .",
    "all the above mentioned approaches were applied in the coordinate representation . the second quantization formalism ( judd  @xcite , rudzikas and kaniauskas  @xcite and rudzikas  @xcite ) has a number of advantages compared to coordinate representation .",
    "first of all , it is much easier to find algebraic expressions for complex operators and their matrix elements , when relying on second quantization formalism .",
    "it has contributed significantly to the successful development of perturbation theory ( see lindgren and morrison  @xcite , merkelis _ et al _  @xcite , and orthogonal operators ( uylings  @xcite ) , where three - particle operators already occur .",
    "uylings  @xcite suggested a fairly simple approach for dealing with separate cases of three - particle operators .",
    "moreover , in the second quantization approach the quasispin formalism was efficiently developed by innes  @xcite , pakauskas _ et al _",
    "@xcite , rudzikas and kaniauskas  @xcite , fano and rau  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that applying the quasispin method for calculating the matrix elements of any operator , we can use all advantages of the new version of racah algebra ( see rudzikas  @xcite ) for integration of spin - angular part of any one- and two - particle operator .",
    "for example , the reduced coefficients of fractional parentage are independent of the occupation number of the shell ( see rudzikas and kaniauskas  @xcite , gaigalas _ et al _",
    "all this enabled merkelis and gaigalas  @xcite to work out a general perturbation theory approach for complex cases of several open shells . in the paper by merkelis  @xcite a detailed review of a version of graphical methodology",
    "is presented that allows one to represent the operators graphically and to find the matrix elements of these operators using diagrammatic technique .",
    "the majority of methods and computer codes of finding angular coefficients discussed above were faced with a number of problems , the main of these being :    * the high demand of cpu time for calculating the angular parts of matrix elements even on the modern computer .",
    "therefore the high accuracy of characteristics of atomic quantities somtimes is even unattainable .",
    "* the methods are applicable in practice only for the comparatively simple systems , because in the programs based on classical racah algebra the treatment of recoupling matrices is rather complicated , especialy when finding the matrix elements of breit - pauli operators between complex configurations . * the configurations with open @xmath40-shells",
    "must often be included in theoretical calculations .",
    "this causes problems in a number of methodologies , because the complete account of @xmath40- shells implies using a large number of coefficients of fractional parentage .",
    "gaigalas and rudzikas  @xcite , gaigalas _",
    "@xcite , gaigalas _",
    "@xcite , gaigalas _ et al _  @xcite and gaigalas and rudzikas  @xcite suggested an efficient and general approach for finding the spin - angular parts of matrix elements of atomic interactions , relying on the combination of the second - quantization approach in the coupled tensorial form , the generalized graphical technique and angular momentum theory in orbital , spin and quasispin spaces as well as on the symetry properties of the quantities considered .",
    "this approach is free of previous shortcomings .",
    "it is the main goal of this work to present all this methodology consistently and in a unifying manner , paying the special attention to its main ideas",
    ". also , we aim at a detailed discussion of obtaining the efficient tensorial expressions of a two - particle operator , as well as the analytical expressions for recoupling matrices .",
    "in addition to that , in this work we aim at comparing this methodology to other calculation of angular coefficients schemes .    from what is said above",
    "we see that the treatment of angular parts of matrix elements is a many - sided question .",
    "the classical scheme by fano was developed in various aspects .",
    "the methods were developed that used racah algebra @xcite on a higher level , or used the new version of the racah algebra ( angular momentum theory in orbital , spin and quasispin spaces ) ( see rudzikas  @xcite ) .",
    "the ways were searched for , to obtain the expressions that had simpler recoupling matrices . in order to discuss all that in more detail , to compare the existing methods of obtaining the angular parts and to mark the advantages of one method or another , the finding angular parts must be looked at from different angles .",
    "thus , the first thing to discuss is the expression for any physical operator ( see sections 2,3,4 ) , because already the form of it determines the level of application of tensor algebra in the calculation of matrix elements of this operator .",
    "also , it is very important to make clear to what extent the racah algebra is exploited in one or another methodology of angular parts treatment .",
    "this helps to mark the advantages of one method against another ( see section 5 ) .",
    "in addition , it is of importance to compare the ways of calculating the recoupling matrix in various methods ( see section 6 ) .",
    "it is well known in the literature that a scalar two - particle operator may be presented the following tensorial form ( see jucys and savukynas  @xcite , glass  @xcite ) :    @xmath41_{p - p}^{(k~k ) } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the radial part of operator , @xmath43 is a tensor acting upon the orbital and spin variables of the @xmath44-th function , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the ranks of operator acting in orbital space , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the ranks of operator acting in spin space .",
    "all the above mentioned approaches were usually applied in the coordinate representation .",

    "as this operator does not cause big problems in the atomic physics , we will not stop for its details .",
    "wick s theorem in the second quantization formalism is formulated as follows ( see wick  @xcite ; bogoliubov and shirkov  @xcite ) : if @xmath141 is a product of creation and annihilation operators , then    @xmath142    where @xmath143 represents the normal form of @xmath141 and @xmath144 represents the sum of the normal - ordered terms obtained by making all possible single , double , ... contractions within @xmath141 .",
    "based on the identification in bogoliubov and shirkov  @xcite , the operator is presented in normal form when all of the operators of annihilation included in it are transferred to the right of the creation operators .    usually , wick s theorem is applied when treating complex operators that are represented by a large number of second quantization operators in a non - normal product form . in atomic physics",
    "such operators are used in perturbation theory ( see fetter and waleka  @xcite ; lindgren and morrison  @xcite ; merkelis _ et al _  @xcite ) and in the orthogonal operator method ( see uylings  @xcite ) .",
    "most often the wick s theorem is applied to the products of second quantization operators that are not tensorially coupled ( see lindgren and morrison  @xcite ) . while applying the perturbation theory in an extended model space , two different groups of second quantization operators",
    "are defined ( see for details in lindgren and morrison  @xcite ) .",
    "the second quantization operators acting upon core states belong to one group , whereas the operators acting upon open and excited shells belong to another one .",
    "these two groups are very different in applying wick s theorem to them .    in the first group ,",
    "the creation operators are re - named to annihilation operators and are called the hole absorption operators , while the annihilation operators are re - named to creation operators and are called the hole creation operators .",
    "the creation operators of the second group are called the particle creation operators , while annihilation ones are called the particle absorption operators .",
    "such a division of second quantization operators into two groups is called the particle - hole formalism .",
    "merkelis _ et al _  @xcite have proposed to use the so - called graphical analogue of wick s theorem in perturbation theory ( see gaigalas _ et al _  @xcite , gaigalas  @xcite ) .",
    "it is an efficient tool for obtaining the normal products of second quantization operators in a coupled tensorial form . before applying this theorem ,",
    "particular second quantization terms are in a normal product in coupled form . in addition , this theorem is applied in the particle - hole formalism , too ( see merkelis _",
    "@xcite , merkelis _ et al _",
    "@xcite ) .    in all the cases mentioned above , the wick s theorem is applied for the most general case of operators , i.e. the shells that are acted upon are not detailed .",
    "but , in the case of the extended model space , the group that the second quantization operators belong to , depending on the electronic structure of atom or ion under investigation , is defined .",
    "wick s theorem is not applied in investigations of ordinary physical operators .",
    "@xcite proposed a new version of the wick s theorem application , where the optimal tensorial expression of any two - particle operator is easily obtained .",
    "the specificity of wick s theorem application in this case lies in applying it only when the shells that are acted upon by the secondary quantization operators are known , i.e. it is applied for each term @xmath145 separately .",
    "such an interpretation of wick s theorem bears similarity with the particle - hole formalism . the only difference is that in this case the second quantization operators are differentiated formally not on the basis of structure of atom under investigation , but on the basis of shells acted upon .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "the second quantization operators acting upon a shell with a lowest index are attributed to the first group .",
    "those acting upon a shell with a next - lowest index are attributed to the second group , etc . in the most general case",
    "we have four distinct groups .    for example",
    ", suppose we have a two - particle operator @xmath146 ,    @xmath147    ( where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) , the matrix element of which between the functions    @xmath151 and @xmath152 we must obtain .",
    "then the operators acting upon the second shell are attributed to the first group , the ones acting upon the third shell - to the second , and the ones acting upon the fifth - to the third group .",
    "assuming that all the operators from first group are the creation ones , and the rest are annihilation operators , we apply the wick s theorem .",
    "thus we obtain that the operators from the first group are one beside another , and all are positioned after the operators from the first group .",
    "thus we obtain :    @xmath153    after that , we apply wick s theorem assuming that the operators from the first and the second groups are creation ones , and the rest of them are annihilation operators .",
    "thus we obtain that the operators from the second group are one beside another , and all are positioned after the first group operators :    @xmath154    if in the product that we investigate there are operators of second quantization acting upon four distinct shells , then we apply wick s theorem once again , assuming that operators from the first , second and third groups are creation ones , and from the fourth group - annihilation ones .",
    "in this case the wick s theorem is applied to the second quantization operators in uncoupled form .    from ( [ eq : op - b ] ) we see that in second quantization a two - particle operator is written as a sum , where parameters @xmath44 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 run over all possible arrays of quantum numbers .",
    "so , the greater the number of open shells in bra and ket functions , the greater the number of terms @xmath145 in the expression of two - particle operator .",
    "it is obvious that all these terms must be systematized in order to obtain in general case the most efficient tensorial expression of a two - particle operator , in the way described above .",
    ".distributions of shells , upon which the second quantization operators are acting , that appear in the submatrix elements of any two - particle operator , when bra and ket functions have @xmath22 open shells ( see gaigalas _",
    "@xcite ) [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the work by gaigalas _",
    "et al _  @xcite it is chosen an optimal number of distributions , which is necessary to obtain the matrix elements of any two - particle operator , when the bra and ket functions consist of arbitrary number of shells .",
    "this is presented in table 1 .",
    "we point out that for distributions 2 - 5 and 19 - 42 the shells sequence numbers @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ( in bra and ket functions of a submatrix element ) satisfy the condition @xmath162 , while for distributions 6 - 18 no conditions upon @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 are imposed ( this permits to reduce the number of distributions ) . for distributions 19 - 42",
    "this condition is imposed only for obtaining simple analytical expressions for the recoupling matrices @xmath163 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "so , in the way that is described earlier , the wick s theorem is applied , assuming that the second quantization operators acting upon shells @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 belong to different groups .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the way to obtain irreducible tensorial form of these distributions .",
    "in addition , the arguments will be given in evidence of superiority of the obtained tensorial expressions against other expressions known in the literature .",
    "the methodology presented in this section demonstrates the way to obtain optimal arrangement of the second quantization operators , for any two - particle operator .",
    "it can be applied without restrictions for obtaining the optimal tensorial form of two - particle terms of orthogonal operators and of perturbation theory operators , too .",
    "the graphical technique of angular momentum is widely used in the atomic physics : see yutsis _",
    "@xcite , jucys and bandzaitis  @xcite , brink and satcher  @xcite , el - baz  @xcite .",
    "it is applied efficiently both in the coordinate representation ( see for example jucys and bandzaitis  @xcite ) , and in the second quantization formalism ( gaigalas _ et al _",
    "the use of it allows one to obtain the analytical expressions for the recoupling matrices conveniently ( see for example kaniauskas and rudzikas @xcite ) , to investigate the tensorial products of operators ( see for example jucys _",
    "@xcite ) , and to seek for the matrix elements of operators ( see for example huang and starace  @xcite ) . gaigalas and merkelis @xcite have proposed a graphical way to obtain the values of matrix elements when the operator is a many - particle ( one- , two- , three- , etc . )",
    "one and has irreducible tensorial form .",
    "for example , when a two - particle operator is considered , it has the form ( [ eq : op - c ] ) or ( [ eq : op - e ] ) . the matrix elements in this methodology are expressed not only in the terms of coefficients of fractional parentage or reduced coefficients of fractional parentage , but in terms of standard quantities @xmath166 and @xmath167 , too .",
    "@xcite have proposed to calculate the matrix elements by using the tensorial expressions for such two - particle operator , that take full advantage of racah algebra . in this case",
    "the tensorial form of operator depends on the shells that the operator acts upon ( distributions 1 - 42 from table  1 ) .",
    "this is the difference of this methodology from other .",
    "it is most convenient to obtain the tensorial expressions for 42 distributions graphically , using the generalized graphical technique by gaigalas _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "in such a case not only the similarities between different distributions are easily seen , but also the compact graphical representation of the obtained expressions is possible .",
    "we will stop for details on this in the present section .",
    "a two - particle operator may be represented graphically by a feynman - goldstone diagram @xmath168 from figure  [ fig : dd - a ] ( lindgren and morrison  @xcite ) . as it is shown in the paper bolotin _",
    "@xcite , the feynman - goldstone diagrams are topologically equivalent to the angular momentum graphs . due to that , an irreducible tensorial form for every feynman - goldstone diagram may be obtained ( see merkelis _",
    "the graph @xmath169 is the angular momentum graph corresponding to the diagram @xmath168 .",

    "the methodology that is based on the second quantization in coupled tensorial form , on the angular momentum theory in three spaces ( orbital , spin and quasispin ) , on the wick s theorem and on the generalized graphical technique of angular momentum , give the possibility to efficiently calculate the matrix elements of energy operators in general case ( gaigalas and rudzikas  @xcite , gaigalas _",
    "@xcite , this paper ) .",
    "the main ideas of this methodology are :    1 .",
    "a number of theoretical methods is known in atomic physics that facilitate a lot the treatment of angular part of matrix elements .",
    "these are the theory of angular momentum , its graphical representation , the quasispin , the second quantization and its coupled tensorial form . but while treating the matrix elements of physical operators in general , the methods mentiond above are applied only some part , or very inefficiently .",
    "+ an idea is presented and carried out in the work gaigalas and rudzikas  @xcite , gaigalas _ et al _  @xcite and this paper , of unifying all these methods in order to optimize the way to treat matrix elements of physical operators , to investigate efficiently even the most complex cases of atoms and ions .",
    "the wick s theorem is widely known in the theory of atom .",
    "up to now it was applied to the most general products of the operators of second quantization , i.e. when the particular arrays of quantum numbers for each operator of second quantization were not yet defined . in the methodology",
    "described there is proposed to apply the wick s theorem for the products of second quantization operators where they have the values of quantum numbers already defined .",
    "this allows one , using the methodology of second quantization in coupled tensorial form , to abtain immediately the optimal tensorial expressions for any operator .",
    "then , in treting the matrix elements of physical operators , the advantages of a new modification of the racah algebra are exploited to their full extent .",
    "3 .   while analysing the physical operators presented as products of tensors @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378^{(k_q k_l k_s)}$ ] , @xmath379^{(k_q k_l k_s)}$ ] , + @xmath380^{(k_q k_l k_s)}$ ] , it is possible to obtain convenient analytical expressions for recoupling matrices that must be taken into account in finding the matrix elements ( non - diagonal with respect to configuration included ) of any physical operator between complex configurations ( with any number of open shells ) .",
    "an idea is proposed and carried out , concerning the most efficient way to apply the tensor algebra and the quasispin formalism in the most general case , for the diagonal and the non - diagonal matrix elements as well , when the bra- and ket- functions have any number of open shells .",
    "the combination of all these improvements allows to efficiently account for correlation efects practically for any atom or ion of periodical table .",
