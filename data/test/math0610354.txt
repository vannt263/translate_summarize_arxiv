    "the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite asserts that a real square matrix with strictly positive entries has a ` spectral gap ' , i.e. the matrix has a positive simple eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues are strictly smaller in modulus .",

    "we say that @xmath4 has a spectral gap if ( 1 ) it has a simple isolated eigenvalue @xmath6 the modulus of which equals @xmath5 and ( 2 ) the remaining part of the spectrum is contained in a disk centered at zero and of radius strictly smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "jentzsch generalized in @xcite the perron - frobenius theorem to integral operators with a strictly positive continuous kernel .",

    "kren - rutman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.3 ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) gave an abstract setting of this result by considering a punctured real closed cone mapped to its interior by a compact operator .",
    "compactness of the operator essentially reduces the problem to finite dimensions .",
    "birkhoff , in a seminal paper @xcite , developed a more elementary and intuitive ( at least in our opinion ) perron - frobenius ` theory ' by considering the projective contraction of a cone equipped with its associated hilbert metric .",
    "birkhoff noted that this projective metric satisfies a _ contraction principle _ , i.e.  any linear map preserving the cone is a contraction for the metric and the contraction is strict and uniform if the image of the cone has finite projective diameter .",
    "all these results , or rather their proofs , make use of the ` lattice'-structure induced by a real cone on a real banach space ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) . on the other hand , from complex analysis we know that the poincar metric on the unit disk , @xmath7 , and the induced metric on a hyperbolic riemann surface enjoy properties similar to the hilbert metric , in particular a _ contraction principle _ with respect to conformal maps .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath8 is a conformal map between hyperbolic riemann surfaces then its conformal derivative never exceeds one .",

    "given a real cone contraction , perturbation theory allows on abstract grounds to consider ` small ' complex perturbations but uniform estimates are usually hard to obtain .",
    "uniform complex estimates are needed e.g.  when proving local limit theorems and refined large deviation theorems for markov additive processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) and also for studying the regularity of characteristic exponents for time - dependent and/or random dynamical systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is desirable to obtain a description of a projective contraction and , in particular , a spectral gap condition for complex operators without the above - mentioned restrictions .",

    ", this looks like the kobayashi construction",
    ". a crucial difference , however , is that we only consider disk images in 2-dimensional subspaces",
    ". also we do not take infimum over chains ( so as to obtain a triangular inequality , see appendix [ a proj metric ] ) .",
    "this adapts well to the study of linear operators and makes computations much easier than for the general kobayashi metric .",
    "lemma [ projective gauge ] shows that this gauge is indeed projective .",
    "the contraction principle for the poincar metric translates into a contraction principle for the gauge and , under additional regularity assumptions , developed in section [ sec complex ] , into a projective contraction , and finally a spectral gap , with respect to the banach space norm .    in sections [",
    "section real case ] and [ sec canonical complexification ] we consider real cones and define their _",
    "canonical complexification_. for example , @xmath10 is the canonical complexification of the standard real cone , @xmath11 .",
    "we show that our complex cone contraction yields a genuine extension of the birkhoff cone contraction  : a real birkhoff cone is _ isometrically _ embedded into its canonical complexification .",
    "it enjoys here the same contraction properties with respect to linear operators .",
    "we obtain in section [ c dominated ] then one of our main results : when a complex operator is _ dominated _ by a sufficiently regular real cone - contraction ( assumption [ main assumption ] ) then ( theorem [ c domin sp gap ] ) the complex operator has a spectral gap .",
    "it is of interest to note that the conditions on the complex operator are expressed in terms of a real cone and sometimes easy to verify .",
    "sections [ sec applications]-[sec rpf ] thus presents a selection of complex analogues of well - known real cone contraction theorems  : a perron - frobenius theorem for complex matrices ( as stated at the end of the abstract ) , jentzsch s theorem for complex integral operators , a kren - rutman theorem for compact and quasi - compact complex operators and a ruelle - perron - frobenius theorem for complex transfer operators .",
