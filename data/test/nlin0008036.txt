    "a sound understanding of hydrodynamic pattern forming systems is based on a balanced interplay between experiment and theory , both analytical and numerical . during the past",
    "this concept has led to considerable progress , especially in case of rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) or taylor - couette flow ( tcf ) , where an amazing level of quantitative agreement has been achieved .",
    "another famous example of pattern forming systems is the faraday experiment : surface waves on a free liquid - air or liquid - liquid interface are excited by a sinusoidal vibration of the fluid layer in vertical direction .",
    "this system has the advantage of fairly short time scales in combination with a very rich bifurcation behavior . during the last two decades the focus in this field was on nonlinear pattern selection @xcite , secondary instabilities @xcite , the transition towards chaos @xcite , droplet ejection @xcite and stokes drift @xcite .",
    "however , due to the parametric drive mechanism the mathematical description of the faraday experiment is more complicated as compared to rbc or tcf and the quantitative understanding is less advanced yet .",
    "for instance , it was not until recently that a rigorous linear stability theory had been developed , valid for viscous fluids and realistic boundary conditions@xcite . nowadays the predictions of the linear theory and the experimental results agree within a few percent @xcite",
    ". on the non - linear level , however , the agreement between theory and experiment can at best be considered qualitative : in the framework of a weakly non - linear perturbation analysis different primary surface wave patterns with quadratic , hexagonal etc .",
    "symmetry have been predicted @xcite . even though most of them have been found in experiments @xcite , empiric and predicted phase diagram reveal only a qualitatitve coincidence .",
    "moreover , other experiments operate with a two - frequency drive signal @xcite , or at very shallow filling heights @xcite or with complex fluids @xcite .",
    "the resulting pattern dynamics becomes more complex and exotic structures like superlattices @xcite or oscillons @xcite appear . in some cases a qualitative understanding based on symmetry arguments could be obtained @xcite .    with regard to this situation",
    "it comes as a surprise that a systematic quantitative investigation of the system s major order parameter , the surface elevation , has not been undertaken yet .",
    "such data is indispensable for a verification of any nonlinear theory .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to provide extensive experimental material in order to fill this gap .",
    "a measurement technique is presented appropriate to quantify the surface elevation of faraday ripples .",
    "our measurements cover a broad part of the parameter space explored in recent experiments on pattern selection in the faraday experiment . in case of low viscosity fluids our findings",
    "are expected to compare with the perturbation analysis of zhang and vinls @xcite  at least at a weak supercritical drive .",
    "furthermore , a closer comparison yields a reliable estimate of the validity range of this approximation .",
    "farther away from threshold of the instability , quantitative theoretical predictions are not available yet . here",
    "we provide a numerical simulation by means of a finite difference scheme .",
    "this computation allows for 2-dimensional solutions of the full navier - stokes equations .",
    "they are used for a comparison with our measurements on line patterns .",
    "we consider a fluid layer of thickness @xmath2 with a free surface vibrated in vertical direction at a drive frequency @xmath3 . in the frame of reference co - moving with the container the liquid is subject to a modulated gravity acceleration @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath6 the amplitude of the drive .",
    "the fluid , considered as being incompressible , is characterized by the kinematic viscosity @xmath7 , the density @xmath8 , and the surface tension @xmath9 .",
    "the hydrodynamic problem is governed by the navier - stokes equation , in which the modulated gravity enters as a parametric drive .",
    "the boundary conditions are free slip at the fluid - air interface and no slip along the walls and the bottom of the container .",
    "if @xmath6 exceeds a critical threshold @xmath10 the surface , being plane at the beginning , undergoes the faraday instability and standing waves with a wavenumber @xmath11 appear .",
    "usually these waves organize themselves in form of regular patterns of different possible symmetries ( lines , squares , hexagons ... ) . in containers with a large lateral aspect ratio ( the ratio between container dimension to wavelength of the pattern ) the pattern selection is geometry independent and solely governed by the nonlinearities in the equations of motion .",
    "in contrast , by changing the lateral container extension one can manipulate the selection process .",
    "for instance , by reducing one sidelength of a beforehand quadratic container , a line pattern ( oriented parallel to the shorter side ) can eventually be enforced in a situation where squares would prevail otherwise . in the present paper extensive use",
    "will be made of this geometrical selection feature .",
    "generically , the time dependence of the faraday mode bifurcating out of the undisturbed plane surface is subharmonic , i.e. the surface oscillates at half the drive frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the standing wave surface profile @xmath13 at onset of the instability can be written in the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 abbreviates the horizontal coordinates .",
    "the set of fourier coefficients @xmath16 determines the subharmonic time dependence .",
    "exactly at the onset of the instability , @xmath17 , one has @xmath18 for even @xmath19 , while the odd coefficients are the components of the eigenvector related to the linear stability problem .",
    "the spatial modes are characterized by the wave vectors @xmath20 , each carrying an individual amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "these quantities are determined by the nonlinearities of the problem and  if appropriate  also by the container geometry . in principle",
    "the @xmath20 can have any length and orientation but usually they are supposed to be equally spaced on the circle @xmath22 .",
    "then the number @xmath23 of participating modes determines the degree of rotational symmetry of the pattern : @xmath24 corresponds to lines , @xmath25 to squares , @xmath26 to hexagons or triangles , etc .",
    "patterns with @xmath27 are no longer translational symmetric , we refer to them as quasi - periodic .",
    "there exist a considerable number of measuring techniques appropriate to investigate the surface wave dynamics .",
    "they range from contacting permittivity measurements @xcite over optical systems @xcite including interferometry , radar back scattering @xcite up to x - ray absorption techniques @xcite .",
    "most of these procedures apply to gravity waves , i.e. long wavelength surface waves .",
    "each of them has its own limitations .",
    "either the amplitude is recorded locally in space , or the detector is too slow to resolve the temporal spectrum .",
    "one of the strongest restrictions for optical reflection techniques comes from the poor reflectivity of most fluid - air interfaces .",
    "only a few percent of the incident light is reflected and an even smaller contribution is due to diffusive back - scattering . since the latter is crucial for standard visualization techniques such as holographic photography or triangulation@xcite , these methods often do not work properly .",
    "one might think of spraying the fluid surface with tracer particles like club moss seeds but this in turn affects the surface tension or the surface viscosity in an uncontrollable manner . in a pair of very recent publications @xcite the authors propose sophisticated methods based on a colored illumination or on an array of microlenses .",
    "a standard visualization technique used in several faraday experiments is the light shadowgraphy @xcite .",
    "a beam of parallel light with a diameter comparable to the container size passes through the fluid layer .",
    "the deformed standing wave surface pattern with its heaps and hollows acting like an array of collecting and diffusing lenses is mapped onto a screen . however , this technique is restricted to very small surface deformations for which the profile can be recovered by ray tracing . otherwise caustics occur , which make this simple and effective method break down .",
    "an alternative technique introduced by wright , budakin and putterman @xcite is based on intensity losses due to diffusive scattering .",
    "these authors use polystyrene colloids to provide light scatterers within the fluid . the transversing light intensity , weakly modulated by the local layer thickness ,",
    "is recorded by a high - sensitivity ccd - camera to reconstruct the surface profile . as an example ,",
    "a snapshot is presented taken at a rather strong drive amplitude within the turbulent regime .    to our knowledge ,",
    "previous quantitative investigations on near - onset faraday waves are restricted to the low - frequency regime , i.e. below @xmath28 .",
    "douady @xcite presents an investigation , where the deflection of a thin laser beam directed onto a wave node is recorded . to prevent the nodes from a gradual drift",
    ", douady uses the  rimfull technique  to fix the position of the pattern relative to the container boundaries . that way the structure experiences a mode discretization dictated by the container geometry .",
    "data for the elevation maxima and the linear relaxation time @xmath29 are provided for a silicone oil at a viscosity of @xmath30 and drive frequencies between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "several other authors report amplitude measurements in small aspect ratio experiments at driving frequencies between 5 and 10hz @xcite .",
    "in this situation a considerable mismatch between frequency and wavelength may occur .",
    "the resulting detuning renders the primary bifurcation hysteretic .",
    "an additional problem in these experiments is the moving contact line between the fluid and the container . it may also generate a hysteresis or even induce an irregular time dependent wave dynamics .",
    "a couple of numerical simulations on faraday waves is worth mentioning in the present context .",
    "zhang and vinls @xcite reduce the original full 3-dimensional hydrodynamic problem to a set of 2-dimensional non - local equations formulated in terms of the lateral coordinates only .",
    "this is the outcome of the so called  quasi - potential approximation  , which considers the bulk flow as being potential ( inviscid ) .",
    "vortical flow contributions in the viscous boundary layer beneath the surface are accounted for by an effective boundary condition .",
    "clearly this analysis is only valid for deep layers ( @xmath33 ) and restricted to the low dissipation limit @xmath34 .",
    "the derived equations for the surface elevation @xmath35 are numerically integrated by a pseudo - spectral algorithm .",
    "the principal concern of these simulations is to obtain the most preferred pattern and to investigate its resistance against secondary instabilities .",
    "stationary patterns with different rotational symmetries have been observed . in particular ,",
    "drive frequencies at the transition between gravity and capillary waves , @xmath36 , give rise to the most interesting structures : quasi - periodic pattern with a 10-fold rotational symmetry @xcite . in the capillary",
    "regime squares or lines are observed depending on the viscosity of the sample fluid .",
    "a somewhat different numerical procedure has been used by schultz et al.@xcite and wright et al .",
    "both investigations are based on the euler equations for inviscid fluids .",
    "dissipation is accounted for by a phenomenological linear damping term introduced afterwards .",
    "the numerical procedures used are respectively a boundary - integral method and a vortex - sheet technique . that way the profile of very steep 2-dimensional faraday waves is investigated .",
    "their findings comprise dimpled crests , the formation of a plumelike shape , or the beginning of droplet ejection .",
    "obviously , all of the aforementioned numerical work is restricted to the low dissipation limit and to large layer thicknesses .",
    "indeed , we are not aware of systematic numerical simulations for viscous fluids on the basis of the full hydrodynamic equations and boundary conditions .",
    "the first step towards a theoretical understanding of pattern forming systems is a linear stability analysis .",
    "this gives access to the threshold amplitude @xmath37 , the critical wave number @xmath38 , and the most unstable mode .",
    "for mathematical convenience it is popular to assume laterally infinite geometries .",
    "although it is known for a long time that the stability problem for faraday waves can be approximately mapped to a parametrically driven pendulum @xcite a rigorous stability analysis for viscous fluids dates back until recently @xcite .",
    "quantities evaluated by this method will be referred to in the following as  results of the exact stability analysis  .    a nonlinear analysis suitable to predict the selected surface pattern just above the primary instability has been presented by zhang and vinls @xcite .",
    "they start form their reduced 2-dimensional set of quasi - potential equations ( see sec .",
    "[ numerical ] ) and perform a perturbation analysis for small supercritical drive @xmath39 .",
    "the analysis can be understood as a double expansion in @xmath40 and in the dimensionless damping parameter @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath33 is assumed , vortical flow contributions coming from the viscous boundary layer along the bottom of the container are ignored .",
    "the pattern wavelength @xmath42 is approximated by the inviscid dispersion relation @xmath43 in our experiments the damping parameter is @xmath44 for the low viscosity sample s1 and lies between @xmath45 and @xmath46 for probe s2 .",
    "accordingly , the wave number @xmath11 evaluated by eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) for s1 agrees within @xmath47 with the result of the exact stability analysis but it is off by @xmath48 for s2 . in the framework of the weakly non - linear analysis the surface profile",
    "is represented by eq .",
    "( [ surf1 ] ) with @xmath49 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 even .",
    "the mode amplitudes @xmath21 are governed by the set of the amplitude equations @xmath50 where @xmath29 is the time constant of linear damping , also an outcome of the linear analysis .",
    "@xmath51 is the non - linear coupling function , whose dependence on the sample specifications and the drive frequency is analytically known .",
    "evaluating @xmath52 at the angle increments @xmath53 between two interacting modes @xmath20 and @xmath54 yields the set of cubic coupling coefficients , which governs the pattern selection process . by computing the stationary solutions of eq.[ampleqn1 ] in the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 at different symmetry indices @xmath23 one obtains the saturation amplitude @xmath58 for line patterns , @xmath59 for squares , etc . as outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite that pattern with the smallest free energy @xmath60 is to be selected . broadly speaking , in the capillary regime investigated here ,",
    "it is either squares ( at low sample viscosities ) or lines ( at higher viscosities ) .",
    "wave patterns with a higher order rotational symmetry are not found since they routinely posses a larger free energy . since our optical reflection technique works best with a 1-dimensional surface modulation",
    ", we make use of the above mentioned geometrical selection feature and perform all experiments in containers of rectangular cross section . that way we enforce line patterns at any investigated sample viscosity and under all operating conditions . under the assumption that the saturation amplitude for lines is not appreciably influenced by the container geometry we are able to compare our data with the line solution ( @xmath24 ) of eq .",
    "@xmath61 here the saturation amplitude is given by    @xmath62    where we have abbreviated @xmath63 by @xmath64 and @xmath65 by @xmath52 .",
    "the surface wave excitation is accomplished by a vibration exciter with a maximum force peak of @xmath66 .",
    "details are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the acceleration signal is computer controlled , its amplitude and harmonicity are stabilized such that fluctuations are smaller than @xmath67 .",
    "we use a container with a rectangular cross section ( length @xmath68 , width @xmath69 ) in the form of a stadium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this side length ratio is sufficient to enforce faraday patterns in form of lines for all investigated sample fluids and under all operating conditions . to minimize disturbances originating from meniscus waves , the form of the rim",
    "is designed as a  soft beach  , where the depth increases up to its maximum of @xmath70 on a length of @xmath71 giving an inclination angle of @xmath72 .",
    "the curved sides of the stadium also help to suppress meniscus waves due to destructive interference .",
    "the vessel was covered by a glass plate to avoid pollution , evaporation and temperature fluctuations .",
    "the temperature of the container ( typically @xmath73 ) is regulated with an accuracy of @xmath74 .",
    "two different _ dow corning 200 _ silicone oils are used as sample fluids . for",
    "a complete specification see tab .",
    "i. the choice of the filling height @xmath75 is large enough to guarantee that the finite depth correction to the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) can be ignored , i.e. @xmath76 for all measurements .",
    "the knowledge of the wave number @xmath11 is crucial for the interpretation of the elevation amplitude ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , before each run of amplitude measurements we evaluate the wave number @xmath11 of the pattern by photographing the free surface illuminated by a diffuse light source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "to record surface wave amplitudes we use a laser beam directed vertically onto the fluid surface ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the cross section of the beam is widened to a diameter between @xmath77 and @xmath78 of a pattern wavelength .",
    "the light beam reflected at the standing wave surface pattern hits a diffusive screen mounted above the liquid - air interface .",
    "the shape of the reflected light pattern depends on the surface wave structure . in case of lines ,",
    "a bright light streak with sharp edges occurs on the screen .",
    "its length , oscillating with the frequency of the external drive , is recorded by a ccd camera and digitized .",
    "the largest length during an oscillation cycle yields the maximum surface slope @xmath79 . according to the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one obtains @xmath80 deflection angles up to @xmath81 have been exploited .",
    "minor effects due to the refraction of the light beam by the glass cover are corrected for . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the light rays marking the tips of the streak may originate from two neighboring elevation nodes .",
    "this and other errors in @xmath82 together with the inaccuracies in @xmath11 and @xmath83 sum up to a relative systematic error in @xmath84 which does not exceed @xmath85 for dive amplitudes @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) . in case",
    "the surface profile at the moment of maximum elevation is approximately sinusoidal with wave number @xmath11 the amplitude @xmath87 can be deduced from ( [ methodeqn ] ) via @xmath88 the light pattern on the diffusive screen is recorded by a ccd camera situated vertically above it .",
    "the pictures are evaluated by a home made processing software . to that",
    "end each image is binarized and the longest distance between any two points of the light streak is extracted .",
    "an automatic adaption of the binarization threshold is implemented to compensate for the decreasing light intensity of the streak during an amplitude ramp .",
    "the measurement of the bifurcation diagram @xmath89 runs as follows : starting at a drive amplitude of @xmath90 , the computer performs an automatic ramp in steps of @xmath91 up to the maximum @xmath92 . for sample s1 it is @xmath93 but only @xmath94 for the more viscous probe s2 .",
    "the fluctuations of the drive acceleration vary from @xmath95 at low drive ( @xmath96 ) up to @xmath67 at @xmath97 . between each increment",
    "the ramp is suspended for a waiting period of @xmath98 minute to allow for the system to equilibrate to the new situation .",
    "then a series of @xmath99 snapshots of the light streak is taken at regular intervals of @xmath100 .",
    "this yields the average streak length and the statistical error as indicated by the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b . after each upwards amplitude ramp",
    "a second scan in opposite direction down to @xmath101 is performed to check for a possible hysteresis in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "in this paper we present extracts from our numerical simulations of the full nonlinear hydrodynamic problem adapted to treat 2-dimensional faraday patterns in form of lines .",
    "a sketch of the implemented algorithm is given here , details will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",

    "therein the non - dimensionalized incompressible evolution equations read as @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 being the @xmath102- and @xmath103-component of the velocity , respectively and @xmath108 being the pressure . to non - dimensionalize",
    "we have used the following unities : wave number @xmath11 for length , @xmath109 for time and @xmath110 for pressure .",
    "the above set of equations is solved on a staggered grid for @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the time integration is carried out by a forward time step , while the diffusive space derivatives and the pressure gradient is evaluated by central differences .",
    "the convective terms are treated by a donor - cell - scheme . with a damped jakobi - method the pressure",
    "is determined such that the incompressibility condition ( [ incompress ] ) is met .",
    "since we are not interested in surface profiles with breaking waves or droplet ejection , @xmath111 is a single valued function .",
    "its dynamics is determined by the kinematic boundary condition @xmath112 the dynamical boundary conditions @xmath113 @xmath114 ensure the continuity of tangential stresses across the interface and the discontinuity of normal stresses due to the finite surface tension . here",
    "@xmath115 denotes the dimensionless viscous stress tensor , @xmath116 is is the surface normal vector in outward direction , and @xmath117 the tangential vector perpendicular to it .",
    "note that the tangential condition is completely ignored in some previous free surface algorithms @xcite . here",
    "the implementation of eq .",
    "( [ tangential ] ) is accomplished by approximating the discretized interface line by either horizontal , vertical or diagonal segments as suggested by grieb @xcite . besides the surface",
    "boundary conditions we impose a no - slip condition at the bottom . for the present simulations",
    "periodic boundary conditions in lateral direction are used , even though our algorithm allows to switch easily to a realistic no - slip situation .",
    "all simulations are performed by a mesh composed of @xmath118 cells per wavelength @xmath119 at a time step size of @xmath120 .",
    "we emphasize that the present integration method does not suffer from the limitations of earlier algorithms ( see sec .",
    "[ numerical ] above ) .",
    "in particular , since it is based on the full navier - stokes equations , there is no restriction to the weakly dissipative limit .",
    "moreover , our algorithm allows to study finite filling levels , even if the depth of the viscous boundary layer compares to the layer thickness @xmath2 .",
    "by virtue of the rectangular container shape the primary faraday pattern consists of lines oriented parallel to the shorter sidewall .",
    "this is in contrast to control experiments carried out in large aspect ratio vessels , where squares are the selected planform under otherwise identical conditions . at the onset of the instability defining @xmath121",
    "the lines occur first in local regions of the surface . by increasing the drive up to @xmath122 the line pattern spreads out over the whole surface",
    ". this non - ideal onset is due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the drive . to rule out whether the finite longitudinal container dimension gives rise to a mode discretization we scanned the drive frequency between @xmath123 up to @xmath124 in steps of @xmath125 .",
    "thereby the number of waves fitting into the container increased from @xmath126 to @xmath127 in a continuous manner . by virtue of the  beach like  container rim no stepwise behavior of the curves",
    "@xmath128 or @xmath129 could be detected .",
    "moreover , the measured onset amplitude and wave number always agreed within @xmath130 with the theoretical prediction of the exact linear analysis computed for a laterally infinite fluid layer .",
    "a set of amplitude measurements performed at four different drive frequencies is shown in fig .",
    "only the data obtained by up - ramping the drive are plotted since the corresponding down - ramps did not deviate significantly .",
    "there was no indication for a hysteretic transition .",
    "the highest drive amplitude achieved was @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) where the maximum surface elevation reaches about @xmath132 , i.e. already @xmath133 of the layer thickness .",
    "however in most runs the amplitude scan had to be stopped at @xmath134 due to an incipient defect dynamics . over the whole investigated drive amplitude range , @xmath135 no deviation of the non - linear wave number @xmath136 from its onset value",
    "@xmath38 could be detected .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams @xmath137 as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "demonstrate that a square - root like increase according to the theoretical prediction @xmath138 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is limited to rather small drive amplitudes below @xmath139 . for a closer quantification we used the experimental data at @xmath140 and fitted the coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "good agreement with the prediction of zhang and vinls ( see squares and solid line in fig.[fig4 ] ) is observed .",
    "it is interesting and to our knowledge unmentioned yet that the analytical expression for @xmath141 @xcite becomes @xmath3-independent at large drive frequencies according to @xmath142 it can be seen from fig .  [ fig4 ] that this asymptotics applies fairly well already at drive frequencies beyond @xmath143 . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) the surface slope @xmath144 should be asymptotically independent of the drive frequency .",
    "this is tested by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the surface slopes associated with different drive frequencies approximately collapse on a common master curve .",
    "this scaling persists even for @xmath145 , i.e. beyond the validity range of the perturbation analysis .",
    "let us briefly discuss possible sources for discrepancies between pertubation analysis and experiment .",
    "as mentioned above , the appearance of line patterns aligned parallel to the shorter container side ( transverse mode ) is enforced by the rectangular container geometry .",
    "the result of this finite geometry effect may be twofold , linear and non - linear .",
    "the linear one is negligible as can be seen from the following argument : the container sidewalls provide a damping offset to both , the longitudinal and the transverse line mode",
    ". however , since the distance between the longer sidewall pair is smaller the threshold shift for the longitudinal mode is enhanced .",
    "indeed , we even find the threshold of the transverse mode almost unaffected : the empiric faraday onset @xmath37 agrees within @xmath130 with the prediction of the exact stability analysis computed for a laterally infinite container .",
    "clearly , this linear reasoning does not imply that the saturated nonlinear pattern amplitude remains unchanged too .",
    "however , estimating the geometry effect upon the coefficient @xmath52 is a difficult task : to that end one had to redo the perturbation analysis in terms of the container eigenmodes instead of the simpler plane waves .",
    "a second cause for deviations to the experimental results is the restriction of the perturbation analysis to a pure sinusoidal time dependence as given by eq .",
    "( [ surf2 ] ) .",
    "however , as outlined in sec .",
    "[ analyt ] the actual frequency spectrum of the faraday mode is not monochromatic . in the investigated region",
    "the error in @xmath37 resulting from this approximation lies between @xmath85 and @xmath146 .    for a quantitative comparison with the experimental data at elevated drive amplitudes we refer to the numerical simulations as described in sec .  [",
    "numerical ] and indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the open symbols .",
    "up to elevated drive amplitudes of @xmath147 we observe good agreement between simulation and experiment .",
    "the deviation is nowhere worse than @xmath148 but considerably better at the higher drive amplitudes , where the systematic error of the detection method is smallest ( see figs .  [ fig3]c , d ) . beyond predicting the local elevation maximum",
    "the simulations also provide access to the spatial anharmonicity of the surface elevation .",
    "we find that the spatial harmonics @xmath149 , @xmath150 ... contribute to the fourier spectrum by less than @xmath151 .",
    "this justifies a posteriori to equate the elevation amplitude @xmath87 with the ratio @xmath152 as used to produce fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "following the same procedure as in the previous section we performed a set of amplitude measurements on the more viscous fluid sample s2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) at a temperature of @xmath153 .",
    "again the selected pattern consists of parallel transverse lines .",
    "however , unlike s1 , this is the preferred planform in large aspect ratio containers too , being a result of the elevated viscosity of probe s2 .",
    "consequently the rectangular container geometry just determines the orientation of the lines rather than altering the selected pattern .",
    "also in contrast to s1 the more viscous probe s2 exhibits a wave amplitude , which grows rapidly with the driving acceleration ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the maximum deflection angle of @xmath154 is reached at @xmath155 .",
    "clearly , at those small drive all bifurcation diagrams show fairly well a square - root like increase according to eq .",
    "( [ squareroot ] ) .",
    "however , the coefficient @xmath52 as compiled from the data at @xmath156 is an order of magnitude larger than for s1 ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath52 deviates substantially from the prediction of the perturbation analysis ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "but the latter observation is not surprising since both the low damping approximation as well as the infinite depth assumption are violated for s2 : note that @xmath157 and the depth of the viscous boundary layer is @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath48 of the layer thickness .",
    "although the perturbation analysis does not quantitatively apply here , we recover the same @xmath3-independent scaling of the bifurcation diagram . the data for the slope @xmath158 collapse again on a master curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) the same way as they did for s1 in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "a final set of measurements is devoted to the viscosity dependence of the surface elevation .",
    "[ fig7]a shows a set of bifurcation diagrams obtained with s2 at different viscosities ( see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by varying the temperature of the probe .",
    "these measurements are performed at the drive frequency @xmath123 . in agreement with our previous observations the surface elevation steeply rises as the viscosity increases .",
    "[ fig7]b shows the dependence of the coefficient @xmath52 on the viscosity as fitted from the experimental data . by comparison with the result of the weakly nonlinear analysis ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) we conclude that the small damping approximation @xmath159 holds at best up to viscosities of @xmath160 .",
    "we have presented a series of systematic amplitude measurements for stationary faraday surface waves .",
    "the investigation is accomplished by a laser beam reflected at the oscillating surface . to facilitate the interpretation of the data",
    "the measurements are performed on line patterns , which are enforced by the rectangular container geometry . due to the soft  beach like  boundary conditions a mode discretization",
    "is avoided .",
    "bifurcation diagrams of the maximum surface deflection vs. the drive amplitude are systematically recorded over a wide parameter range of drive frequency and sample viscosity .",
    "the experimental data reveal that the perturbation analysis of zhang and vinls @xcite applies quantitatively to fluids with a viscosity of less than @xmath161 and to very small drive amplitudes of not more than @xmath162 . moreover , we observe that the surface slope scales almost independently of the drive frequency .",
    "this finding is also supported by the analytical expression for the nonlinear coupling coefficient @xmath52 as derived in the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "qualitatively this scaling behavior persists even up to drive amplitude of @xmath163 , i.e. at operating conditions , where the perturbation theory is no longer applicable .    for a quantitative comparison of our data at elevated drive amplitudes we provide a numerical simulation of faraday waves on the basis of the full navier - stokes equation .",
    "this new algorithm does not suffer from the standard restrictions of the low dissipation limit and large filling thicknesses as used by other previous simulations .",
    "good quantitative agreement with the empiric data is found up to the highest investigated drive amplitudes of @xmath163 .",
