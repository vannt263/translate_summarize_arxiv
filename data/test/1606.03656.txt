    "the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory reveals the phase transition from a landau fermi liquid into superconductivity in conventional superconductors @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the electron quasiparticles around the fermi surface are bound into coherent cooper pairs in the presence of an attractive potential resulted from electron - lattice interaction .",
    "however , for unconventional superconductors , such as cuprates @xcite , iron - pnictides @xcite and heavy fermions @xcite , the normal states are often non - fermi liquids @xcite , which is seemingly indescribable in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "in addition , phonons are unlikely to mediate electrons into cooper pairs in these strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "to drive the phase transition , the sought bosons or bosonic excitations should already exist in the normal state by analogy with phonons in fermi - liquid metals . the spin fluctuation is believed to be the most promising candidates @xcite .",
    "however , so far , the most serious challenge to the theories is to elucidate the non - fermi liquids and superconductivity on the same footing .    in these unconventional superconductors ,",
    "one striking feature is the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons @xcite .",
    "for example , in heavy fermion compound upd@xmath3al@xmath4 , the dual @xmath5 electron model successfully explains both the superconductivity and the magnetic resonance based on the interaction between the localized and itinerant @xmath5 electrons @xcite .",
    "likewise , the duality of electrons is shared by hundreds of cuprate superconductors besides a universal phase diagram and a layered structure made up of one or more copper - oxygen ( cu - o ) planes @xcite . in the insulating parent compound of cuprates , only the @xmath6 orbital",
    "is half - filled in each cu ion , denoted by a localized hole with spin-@xmath7 . with the hole doping , primarily on o sites ,",
    "the introduced carriers gradually melt antiferromagnetic order and eventually lead to superconductivity .",
    "generally , it is believed that the physical properties are dominated by the cu - o planes due to the universality in cuprates .",
    "thus , a three - band model is constructed to include both localized and conducting electrons @xcite .",
    "it can be further reduced to a simpler one , such as the kondo - heisenberg model @xcite , the spin - fermion @xcite and @xmath8-@xmath9 model @xcite , which are widely used to describe the itinerant - localized duality of electrons in cuprates .",
    "here , we take advantage of a dual fermion model or kondo - heisenberg - like model to explore the generic cuprate phase diagram . markedly different from the one - component spin - fluctuation models proposed before @xcite , the dual fermion model not only retains their most outstanding advantage , @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry , but also reconciles with the phenomenological marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) model @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it yields a kondo - insulator - like pseudogap @xcite and gets around the single - component models difficulty that the same pairing electrons also form the pairing ` glue ' in superconductivity @xcite . using the hole notation ,",
    "the dual fermion hamiltonian is composed of two kinds of fermions , the doped hole quasiparticels on the o sites and localized holes on the cu @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hopping integral of the hole carrier quasiparticles on o sites .",
    "@xmath13 is the annihilation operator of carriers in unit cell @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the annihilation operator of localized holes on the cu @xmath0 orbitals . @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the pauli vector @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the kondo - like coupling between the carriers and localized holes , and @xmath20 is the heisenberg interaction between the holes on the cu square lattice ( for details , see appendix  [ appmodel ] ) .    remarkably , different from the conventional kondo - heisenberg model ,",
    "the much larger @xmath19 splits the carrier energy dispersion into two bands , possibly with overlaps , i.e. the singlet and triplet channels in the atomic limit .",
    "considering the hole doping concentration @xmath21 , we only focus on the lower - energy band where the carrier and the cu hole have opposite spin orientation in the same unit cell .",
    "additionally , contrary to the conventional @xmath22 model @xcite , we probe the low - energy properties by integrating out the cu degrees of freedom @xmath23 rather than the o @xmath24 in the strange metal , pseudogap and superconductivity phases .    in the following",
    ", we will show that the typical cuprate phase diagram can be understood solely from the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) . based on this model , the characteristic interaction feynman diagrams",
    "are plotted in each region of the phase diagram for hole - doped cuprates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] . in the absence of doping",
    ", only the heisenberg interaction takes its role , describing the charge - transfer antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators @xcite . upon doping ,",
    "the dilute holes on the o sites are trapped around the cu magnetic moments with opposite spin configurations , and antiferromagnetism gradually melts into a spin glass at low temperature before the onset of superconductivity with further doping . in the strange metal phase , the doped holes on o sites form a fermi gas , coexisting with the heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "although the long range af order disappears due to doping , the dynamical af correlation inherits from the parent compounds .",
    "owing to the interaction with the strongly momentum - dependent af fluctuation , as shown in the following , the carrier fermi gas is transformed into a non - fermi liquid similar to the mfl .",
    "as the temperature decreases , part of the itinerant carriers bind to the local cu magnetic moments forming localized zhang - rice singlets , and a pseudogap opens . in the superconductivity phase ,",
    "the af cu - spin fluctuations mediate the conduction carriers into cooper pairs . in the overdoped region",
    ", the system behaves as a fermi liquid in normal state .",
    "in addition , we show that the strange metal is caused by the same underlying physics that causes superconductivity .     versus hole dopant concentration @xmath25 .",
    "each regime of phase diagram is labeled with a specific interaction feynman diagram _ in real space _ based on the dual fermion model .",
    "the interactions are represented by the wavy lines without distinction , whereas the o and cu holes are represented by solid and dash lines , respectively . for non - doping ,",
    "the heisenberg interaction describes the charge - transfer antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators . upon doping",
    ", antiferromagnetism gradually melts . in the strange metal ( sm ) phase",
    ", the doped hole fermi gas is transformed into a non - fermi liquid by the heisenberg antiferromagnets . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "part of the itinerant carriers couple with the local cu magnetic moments forming localized zhang - rice singlets , and a pseudogap ( pg ) opens . in the superconductivity ( sc )",
    "phase , the af cu - spin fluctuations are the glue of cooper pairs . in the overdoped region , the fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior arises at low temperature .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ]",
    "getting inspiration from the conventional superconductivity rooted in the fermi - liquid theory , we start from the normal state of cuprates , namely , the strange metal . previously , although the celebrated phenomenological model of mfl can account for the universal anomalies of the strange metal @xcite , the proposal of @xmath26-wave pairing symmetry indeed dims its brilliance slightly .",
    "in particular , the experimentally confirmed @xmath1-wave superconductivity @xcite conclusively rules out the momentum featureless fluctuations as the pairing glue .",
    "more importantly , it is baffling that why the experimentally observed strong af spin fluctuations give ignorable contribution to the normal state , in contrast to the hypothesized momentum - uniform excitations .",
    "additionally , the same physics is expected to cause both the strange metal and superconductivity @xcite .    here",
    ", we provide a distinct physical picture for the strange metal , in which the universal anomalies result from the strong af fluctuations .",
    "the carriers on o sites are assumed to compose a fermi gas , with the retarded green s function @xmath27 since the high order interaction between the dilute carriers are ignored except in the superconductivity and fermi - liquid phases .",
    "the fermi gas baths in the cu heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "most of the properties in the normal state are supposed to be determined by the retarded one - particle self - energy of the carriers due to the interaction with the cu - spin fluctuation @xmath28 .",
    "we have omitted the first order self - energy correction , since it can be absorbed into the renormalized chemical potential . within the born approximation ,",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy by the spin correlation scattering reads ( see appendix  [ appselfenergy ] ) :    @xmath29 i(\\mathbf{k},\\omega , v),\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{selfenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the bose and fermi functions , @xmath32 is the upper cutoff frequency of magnetic fluctuations and @xmath33 where the momentum integration is over the brillouin zone .",

    "therefore , the anomalies in electrical resistivity , tunneling conductance , specific heat , thermal conductivity , photoemission and the drude contribution @xmath42 in optical conductivity could be justified as in the mfl model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the mfl model , both the nuclear relation rate and optical conductivity are assumed to result from two important contributions .",
    "naturally , in our dual model , the two terms originate from the carriers and the cu ions , respectively .",
    "the carriers yield the normal term proportional to @xmath43 in spin - lattice relaxation @xmath44 and the drude part in optical conductivity in spite of the non - fermi - liquid characteristics .",
    "the cu spin and charge fluctuations contribute the temperature - independent constant in @xmath44 and the leading direct absorption @xmath45 in the optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "corroboration is that @xmath46 for o basically follows a korringa rate , as in a conventional metal @xcite .",
    "in addition , nearly frequency- and temperature - independent , the experimentally observed featureless raman intensity implies that the charge susceptibility @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 provided the leading inelastic raman scattering is contributed by the cu ions .",
    "emerging from the strange metal , a partial energy gap or pseudogap opens at the fermi level @xcite , deep enough for states to become localized .",
    "its microscopic mechanism is still puzzling . here , based on its close association with the strange metal , we put forward a proposal that the pseudogap derives from the dilute itinerant holes coupling to the cu localized holes and forming localized zhang - rice singlets below the crossover temperature @xmath49 .",
    "deriving from the kondo - like interaction in hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) ( see appendix  [ appps ] ) , the localized singlet formation process is represented by @xmath50 , where the fermionic composite operator @xmath51 is introduced to denote the annihilation of a singlet accompanying the creation of a cu @xmath1 hole in unit cell @xmath14 , @xmath52 the creation of a composite fermion breaks the magnetic bonds with its four surrounding cu spins and is effectively equivalent to a soliton on the spin-@xmath7 square lattice .",
    "in addition , the assumption of a singly occupied cu hole results in the conclusion that no more than one composite fermion resides in any unit cells . in this phase , the carriers and the composite fermions coexist and transform each other with the same chemical potential , and the kondo - like interaction in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is rewritten as @xmath53 in the singlet channel , where @xmath54 corresponding to spin up and down , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward that a gap opens in the system due to the hybridization between the carriers and the dispersionless composite quasiparticles in eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) , just as in kondo insulators @xcite .",
    "the indirect ` hybridization gap ' @xmath55 is around @xmath56 , much smaller than the direct gap @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the half - width of the conduction band @xcite , and @xmath59 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the doping dependence of the effective heisenberg coupling @xcite",
    ", the indirect gap should be proportional to @xmath60 with a constant @xmath61 and the hole doping concentration @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , in this hybridization picture , the total particle number is conserved during the transformation between the carriers and the localized composite quasiparticles , i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the concentrations of the carriers and the composite quasiparticles , respectively . with decreasing of temperature or doping level , a higher proportion of the doped holes bind to cu local moments into the localized singlets . particularly , in af insulator phase , no carriers survive , namely , @xmath66 .",
    "the presence of an energy gap often induces the increase of the resistance but the formation of localized zhang - rice singlets reduces the af fluctuation scattering rate on the cu - o planes .",
    "this competition potentially leads to the drop of planar resistivity in contrast with the upturn of the c - axis resistance for temperatures below @xmath49 ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . actually , the cuprates with anisotropic pseudogaps are more akin to nodal kondo insulators .",
    "nevertheless , the nodal character and doping dependence of kondo insulators are poorly understood from the simple hybridization picture @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that different from the conventional kondo lattice , the singlets in pseudogap are randomly scattered across the lattice rather than over each site especially in the underdoped regime .",
    "moreover , the superconductivity fluctuation , phonons , fermi surface nesting and the coulomb interaction between charges further complicate the situations , e.g. the formation of preformed cooper pairs , stripe phase , nematic order , spin and/or charge density order @xcite .",
    "to get insight into the origin of superconductivity emerging from the pseudogap and/or strange metal , we propose that the carrier pairing is mediated by the high - energy short - range cu - spin fluctuations , persisting into the superconducting phase from the normal state .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the magnetic - exciton pairing mechanism @xcite in heavy fermion compound upd@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "as described above , the isolated zhang - rice singlets break their surrounding af bonds and then the localized cu holes composing the singlets are completely separated from other local moments . on the other hand , the local moments may only be partially screened by doped holes without formation of onsite singlets , and then the heisenberg interaction between the screened moments and their surroundings could survive . thus , the carriers on unit cell @xmath14 and @xmath67 could interact with each other by exchanging the cu - spin fluctuations .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written in the coordinate representation as ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and appendix  [ appsc ] ) @xmath68 combining with @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , a @xmath8-@xmath9-like model is reached .",
    "interestingly , despite the formal similarity with the conventional @xmath8-@xmath9 model @xcite , here the operator @xmath70 is associated with the carriers on the o sites rather than the local moments on cu ions .",
    "experiments have confirmed that the magnetic susceptibility in momentum space becomes sharply peaked around af wave vector @xmath71 in cuprates @xcite , which indicates that only the @xmath1-wave pairing channel is favored @xcite and the attractive pairing interaction dominantly mediates the carriers on the nearest - neighbor unit cells @xcite . in consideration of the two lattice spacings order of the af spin correlation length at low temperature ,",
    "we only take the nearest - neighbor coupling into account in eq .",
    "( [ hsc ] ) and define an effective coupling between the carriers , @xmath72 @xmath73 is approximately assumed to be a constant within the spin fluctuation cutoff energy @xmath74 , otherwise , @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , in momentum space , a weak coupling bcs interaction can be written in @xmath1-wave pairing channel , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath6-wave gap function .",
    "the superconductivity order parameter @xmath78 is introduced in the mean field method with the bcs gap equation @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the cooper pair operator denoting a bond state of two carriers with opposite momentum and spin .",
    "intuitively , the superconductivity gap should depend on the density of superconducting carriers .",
    "however , this dependence is concealed in the formula of the zero temperature energy gap @xmath81 and the critical temperature @xmath2 in the bcs theory . the concealment results from the implicit bcs assumption that the pairing cutoff energy or debye energy is far less than the electron fermi energy or chemical potential @xmath82 , namely , the migdal s theorem , being perfect for metals . however , in lightly doped cuprates , the doped hole fermi energy @xmath83 could be less than the relatively high spin fluctuation cutoff energy @xmath84 . despite the violation of the migdal s limits",
    ", it is generally believed that the cuprate superconductivity is basically bcs - like @xcite . in this case",
    ", we propose that the integral cutoff energy in the bcs gap equation should be @xmath85 since there exists no carrier state below the bottom of the energy band ( see appendix  [ appgapequ ] ) . to some extent",
    ", this revision restores the dependence of the gap on the superconducting carrier density .",
    "for instance , when the fermi energy @xmath82 is less than the spin fluctuation cutoff @xmath84 , the superconductivity transition temperature @xmath86 , otherwise @xmath87 with @xmath88 for weak coupling @xmath1-wave superconductors",
    ". it is worthy of noting that the coupling @xmath73 associated with spin fluctuations should be gradually suppressed with doping increasing .",
    "consequently , the characteristic dome - shaped @xmath2 versus doping level is sketched out for hole - doped cuprates . to further underline the importance of the revised cutoff energy in the gap equation , assuming the fermi energy @xmath89 less than @xmath84 , then we find @xmath90 , ranging almost from the zero doping to optimal doping , where we have set the half - bandwidth @xmath911 ev and @xmath92 ev .",
    "it is still premature to quantitatively calculate the critical temperature @xmath87 because it is sensitive to the coupling @xmath93 due to the large spin fluctuation cutoff energy , for example , @xmath94 , then @xmath95 k@xmath96 k. in addition , the coupling @xmath73 is difficult to calculate quantitatively and the coulomb repulsion between pairing carriers has been ignored .    finally , it is noteworthy that in our model , the cu - spin - fluctuation frequency for pairing is much higher than the characteristic frequency in one - component models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the higher pairing frequency is reconcilable with the experimental measurements @xcite and the existing theoretical conclusions that low - frequency spin fluctuations are pair breaking @xcite and the optimal spectral weight for pairing originates from a frequency range larger than twice the maximum value of the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "despite using a hole representation , our results are independent of the hole or electron notation .",
    "the concentration of the spin unpaired holes and electrons on o sites are always the same , corresponding to the hole doping level @xmath62 . only a singly occupied hole or electron on an o site couples to a localized cu hole composing a zhang - rice singlet in our model .",
    "similarly , only the spin unpaired holes or electrons on the o sites are mediated by the cu - spin fluctuations via the kondo - like interactions .",
    "markedly , it is desired to understand the af dynamical correlations and justify the neglect of vertex corrections in both self - energy and the pairing interaction in this work beyond the arguments @xcite .",
    "the ignored intra - unit - cell freedoms should endow more detailed characteristics @xcite .",
    "much more substantial work is needed to clarify the extremely complex phenomena , such as the nodal character and doping dependence in pseudogap , space and/or time symmetry breaking , the strong coupling superconductivity effects , the fermi arcs and the lifshitz transition of fermi surface @xcite . to test the dual fermion model",
    ", it is of crucial importance to separate the cu - spin fluctuations from the carrier magnetic excitations .",
    "we propose that the element - specific experimental measurements are competent , such as inelastic x - ray scattering and nmr . in the pseudogap phase",
    ", we expect that the direct kondo - insulator - like gap could be visible to optical conductivity and the ratio of carrier to localized composite fermion could be detected in the carrier - sensitive hall experiments .",
    "the validity of our generalized bcs gap equation could be examined in the superconductors with low superfluid density .    in conclusion",
    ", the itinerant - localized dual fermi model can unify the main universal features of the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "our work paves a novel way to the studies of both non - fermi liquid and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems .",

    "part of the carriers bind to the local cu moments into localized zhang - rice singlets .",
    "the carriers and the singlets coexist and transform into each other with the same chemical potential . the transform process bases on the kondo - like interaction between carriers and the localized cu holes .    using the fermionic representation of the carrier s @xmath70 and cu s @xmath184 operators , the kondo - like term in dual fermion model",

    "the creation of a composite quasiparticle locally breaks its surrounding magnetic bonds and is equivalent to a soliton on the spin-@xmath7 square lattice .",
    "therefore , the composite quasiparticle forms a dispersionless energy level just at the fermi level , the hybridization between the carriers and composite fermions induces an indirect gap as in kondo - insulators @xcite @xmath189    considering the doping dependence of the @xmath20 , @xmath190 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with a constant @xmath61 and the hole doping concentration @xmath62 .",
    "the half - width of the conduction band @xmath58 is around 1 ev .",
    "actually , in the strange metal phase , a temporal zhang - rice singlet could form from an itinerant o hole and a localized d hole , and decomposes into two holes repeatedly as a o hole hops from one site to another .",
    "this by no means deviates away from our previous picture that the carrier fermi gas baths in the scattering of the localized cu holes .",
    "to understand the cuprate superconductivity , the key is to unveil the interaction mediating the formation of cooper pairs . as the doped holes couple to the local moments and form localized zhang - rice singlets , then the correlation between those doped holes and others",
    "are broken off .",
    "however , an itinerant doped hole could not always completely screen a local moment one - on - one .",
    "thus , the doped holes could interact with both localized and other itinerant holes .    in dual fermion model , the carriers on unit cell @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath67 could interact with each other by exchange of the cu - spin fluctuation in terms of a four point vertex , written in real space as @xmath191    the interaction hamiltonian is written in real space as @xmath192 it is also denoted by the feynman diagram in the sc region of the phase diagram .",
    "when we only consider the nearest - neighbour coupling , the interaction can be reduced to    @xmath193    where the nearest neighbour @xmath194 is assumed to be space independent . applying the triplet and singlet decomposition in eq .",

    "therefore , the strange metal is caused by the same underlying physics that causes high-@xmath209 superconductivity .",
    "although the normal state of cuprates is universally anomalous , the superconductivity is quite ` normal ' , i.e. bcs - like .",
    "kogan further demonstrated that the homes scaling , as a matter of fact , indicates another universal property of bcs superconductors including cuprates @xcite .      to further simplify the gap equation , we assume that the @xmath1-wave gap function @xmath211 with @xmath212 . the gap equation becomes @xmath213 where the bare particle @xmath214 is a constant value @xmath215 for an ideal two - dimensional fermi gas with quadratic dispersion .",
    "the @xmath216 is the integral cutoff energy .",
    "different from the conventional bcs method , we show that the integral cutoff energy should be @xmath220 because @xmath221 in gap equation at low temperature , and the cutoff energy of non - zero @xmath73 is @xmath222 . as @xmath222 is far less than the fermi energy @xmath223 , the integral upper limit @xmath216 is equal to @xmath222 .",
    "thus , the bcs gap equation is restored . however , in the superconductors with small superfluid density , for example , the lightly hole - doped cuprates , @xmath224 , the @xmath209 is given by @xmath225    thus , the critical temperature is proportional to the doping level , agreeing with the experimental uemura law @xcite and the phase stiffness model @xcite as well as the recent work @xcite .",
    "therefore , not only in the overdoped regime but also in underdoped regime , the revised bcs gap equation is competent .",
    "however , it is worth noting that we have ignored the coulomb repulsion between pairing carriers ."
