    "the global dynamical properties of galaxies can be summarised by scaling relations between their mass or luminosity , their size , and the velocity of their constituent stars and gas . for spirals , the tully  fisher relation ( tfr )",
    "describes a tight correlation between galaxy mass and rotation velocity , with a scatter of around 0.08 dex in velocity when stellar mass is used as the independent variable  @xcite , and 0.03 dex for baryonic mass  @xcite .",
    "although a further correlation exists between mass and radius , with a scatter of around 0.17 dex  @xcite , it appears that no relation tighter than the tfr can be constructed by including radius information . for ellipticals ,",
    "however , the analogue of the tfr , the faber  jackson relation ( fjr ;  @xcite ) , _ does _ exhibit a significant correlation of its residuals with galaxy size , in the sense that smaller than average galaxies have larger than average velocity dispersion .",
    "in other words , there exists a relation tighter than the fjr in the form of a fundamental plane ( fp ) : @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting relation has @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and a scatter of around 0.09 dex in @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "since the internal motions of galaxies are set largely by their dark matter mass , these relationships provide key insight into the connection between galaxies and their host haloes . in this work",
    ", we construct a semi - empirical framework in @xmath0cdm to predict the velocity dispersions of early - type galaxies , and hence the fjr and fp .",
    "in particular , our modelling approach is based on subhalo abundance matching ( am ) , which posits a nearly one - to - one relation between stellar mass and a halo proxy , typically a mass or velocity at a chosen epoch .",
    "models based on this technique have been shown to provide an excellent fit to a wide range of spatial statistics of the galaxy population , including the galaxy - galaxy two and three - point correlation functions , galaxy - galaxy lensing , and group statistics  @xcite . however , am as it is usually implemented does not distinguish between galaxies of different morphology , and therefore requires testing against the scaling relations of both late and early - type galaxies . here",
    "we investigate whether the properties of the fjr and fp are consistent with the galaxy  halo connection implied by am .",
    "we intend in this way to evaluate agreement between galaxy - scale and large - scale constraints on this connection , and bring out the additional information contained in the fjr and fp on the processes governing galaxy formation .",
    "our approach may be usefully situated at the intersection of two broad classes of methodology for understanding the dynamical relations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a bottom - up approach focuses on detailed kinematic analysis and mass modelling of a small number of individual galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the jeans equation is solved in full , the anisotropy profile may be determined simultaneously with the velocity dispersion profile , and dark matter fractions in the inner regions are estimated by fitting one or more halo profiles to the data .",
    "this approach has the advantage of affording tight control over the model baryonic and dark matter masses of individual systems and hence enables a high precision comparison of theory to data .",
    "however , the samples analysed in this way tend to be small ( up to a few hundred galaxies ) , and may therefore be unrepresentative in relevant galaxy properties .",
    "furthermore , dark matter modelling on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis prevents comparison with cosmological expectations for the halo population obtained from @xmath5-body simulations and a complete galaxy formation model . except in the most extreme cases ,",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assess statistically the extent to which the results are consistent with @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "the alternative top - down approach uses a fully cosmological framework to derive model values for galaxy observables .",
    "this may be attempted in several different ways depending on the theoretical assumptions employed .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations implement physically motivated prescriptions for baryonic physics in order to simulate galaxy formation in situ and concurrently with the evolution of dark matter haloes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although in principle applying basic physics in the most straightforward way , such simulations are too computationally expensive to generate theoretical galaxy populations of sufficient size to allow robust statistical comparison with observations .",
    "this method may therefore be usefully complemented by semi - analytic and empirical models ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which forgo complete treatment of baryonic physics in favour of simple mappings between galaxy and halo properties in order to predict galaxy observables from the outputs of @xmath5-body simulations . although potentially dependent on uncertain parametrizations of key properties , these methods in principle allow statistically rigorous comparison of theoretical and observed galaxy populations .",
    "hydrodynamical , semi - analytical , and empirical methods have the advantage that they permit a direct test of concrete , cosmologically - motivated galaxy formation scenarios using a representative halo population . on the other hand , theoretical results are typically compared with large and often heterogeneous observational data sets without regard to selection effects , the assumptions and approximations used in the galaxy modelling , or the peculiar nature of particular galaxy subsets .",
    "the systematic error budget is therefore uncertain and potentially large .",
    "furthermore , it is rare for such studies to simultaneously investigate the dependence of velocity dispersion on galaxy size in the fundamental plane , the scaling relations scatter , or the effect of radial orbit anisotropy .    by combining the precision of the bottom - up approach with the scope and power of the top - down approach ,",
    "we intend our methodology to permit detailed inferences of cosmological scope . we will use a complete galaxy formation model based on halo abundance matching to create predictions for the fjr and fp , and establish a set of key diagnostics with which to compare the output of the model to a single homogeneous data set with well - defined selection criteria .",
    "we prune the observational data set to those galaxies whose structure is compatible with our mass model , use an identical velocity dispersion measure in the theoretical and observed fjr , ensure the distributions and covariances of size , stellar mass and srsic index are the same between theory and data , and explicitly consider the possible impact of radial orbit anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , we pay particular attention to the tilt and scatter of the fp .",
    "we note that an alternative approach which has been used in the literature to model elliptical galaxies is based on the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) as opposed to @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "these models seek to explain the dynamics of galaxies by positing a breakdown of newtonian gravity at low acceleration , instead of invoking dark matter haloes .",
    "work done along these lines includes  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , and suggests that this framework may be able to offer a convincing explanation of the tilt and small scatter of the fundamental plane with realistic assumptions about galaxy structure and radial orbit anisotropy . in mond , an elliptical lies on a fundamental plane near the newtonian virial relation when the acceleration of stars in its inner region is high and hence their dynamics are quasi - newtonian ; the faber ",
    "jackson relation ( of the specific form @xmath6 ) is the effective virial relation in the low - acceleration deep - mond regime that obtains in low surface brightness galaxies and the outer regions of high surface brightness ones .",
    "however , none of these models have been shown to match the spatial statistics of galaxies on large scales .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the observational data against which we test our model , and documents the @xmath5-body simulation from which halo properties are drawn . section  [ sec : method ] details our methodology . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results for the faber  jackson relation and fundamental plane .",
    "we will develop a series of models of increasing complexity , comparing in each case the predicted and observed values of five key properties of the fjr and fp .",
    "the main results are summarised in table  [ tab : table ] and figure  [ fig : fjr_cont ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the general significance and broader ramifications of our results , as well as their relation to results in the literature .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .    this work may be seen as a companion to  @xcite ( hereafter dw15 ) , to which it is similar in approach and methodology . in dw15",
    "we explored the aptitude of our am framework to reproduce the spiral galaxy tully  fisher and mass  size relations ; here we redeploy and augment these models in order to investigate the elliptical galaxies that we previously excluded .",
    "in several places we refer to dw15 for more detail .",
    "we compare our model to data from the nasa - sloan atlas ( nsa ) .",
    "this is a compilation of galaxy properties within the footprint of sdss dr8 out to redshift @xmath7 , cross - matched with a number of other catalogues .",
    "sky - subtraction and photometric determinations in the nsa are believed to be among the most reliable available  @xcite .",
    "we will cast all scaling relations in terms of stellar mass rather than luminosity , as the fundamental plane .",
    "this is sometimes called the `` mass plane '' in the literature to distinguish it from the relations @xmath8 and @xmath9 . ] and take mass - to - light ratios from the kcorrect algorithm  @xcite with a universal chabrier imf ( but see section  [ sec : contraction ] for a discussion of the effect of imf choice ) .",
    "we select from the nsa a subsample of galaxies to compare to our fjr and fp model predictions .",
    "first , we clean the data by eliminating galaxies with unreliable size or redshift measurements  @xcite , and restrict to @xmath10 .",
    "we next deduce the angular diameter distance @xmath11 , effective radius @xmath12 , and srsic index @xmath13 of each galaxy .",
    "the angular diameter distance is calculated from the redshift assuming a flat cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath12 is derived by first multiplying the ` sersic_th50 ` field of the nsa ( the angular half - light radius along the major axis ) by the angular diameter distance , and then circularising the light profile by multiplying by the square root of the minor - to - major axis ratio .",
    "the spherically - symmetric srsic index @xmath13 is set equal to the 2d srsic index recorded in the nsa , from which we find it is not systematically offset .",
    "we thus determine the relative frequency distribution \\{@xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 } , which we will use in section  [ sec : model ] to assign @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 values to our model galaxies as a function of @xmath16 .",
    ", we use units of @xmath17 throughout . ]",
    "next , we impose the following selection criteria to ensure that the galaxies in our final sample have mass distributions that adhere as closely as possible to the spherically - symmetric srsic profile that we will give our model galaxies .",
    "these are typical cuts for eliminating rotation - dominated galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    1 .",
    "srsic index @xmath18 ( low-@xmath13 galaxies are more likely to be flattened and discy , and the sdss analysis code has a hard upper limit at @xmath19 ) .",
    "2 .   concentration ratio @xmath20 ( pressure - supported systems tend to be less compact ) .",
    "apparent axis ratio @xmath21 ( low projected ellipticity favours more spherical early - type galaxies )",
    ".    we will refer to the galaxies passing these cuts as `` early - type '' or `` elliptical '' and the remainder as `` late - type '' or `` spiral . ''",
    "we caution , however , that these definitions may not conform to others in the literature , which may include a cut on colour ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or be based on visual inspection ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since we will find that the precision of our analysis is not limited by statistical uncertainties due to sample size , we choose the threshold values for our cuts to be fairly stringent to maximise agreement with our model assumptions . taken together",
    ", these factors result in `` elliptical fractions '' in our analysis significantly lower than in many literature studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we next impose a stellar mass cut to generate a volume - limited sample with the same @xmath16 distribution as our am mocks . assuming a conservative apparent magnitude limit of @xmath22 , the sdss and hence nsa data are complete to @xmath23 out to @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "we find that the stellar mass value above which all galaxies in both the early and late - type subsample have @xmath25 is @xmath26 , which we impose as the lower @xmath16 limit in our analysis .",
    "these cuts leave 6,088 elliptical galaxies out of 36,520 total . since we will be interested in the possible impact of the elliptical selection criteria on our theoretical galaxy population ( section  [ sec : model ] ) , we record also the fraction of galaxies retained as a function of stellar mass .",
    "this rises from @xmath27 at @xmath28 to @xmath29 at @xmath30 , the highest stellar mass we consider .",
    "finally , we generate an early - type catalogue of \\{@xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath31 } values , to which we will compare our model predictions .",
    "we include at this stage a final requirement , @xmath32 , which removes galaxies whose velocities are untrustworthy  @xcite .",
    "we will apply this cut in the same way to the mock data sets .",
    "the final early - type subsample contains 5,682 galaxies .",
    "our theoretical galaxy population is based on the haloes generated in the darksky-400 simulation  @xcite , a @xmath33 box with @xmath34 particles , run with the 2hot code  @xcite .",
    "the darksky suite assumes a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the darksky-400 box is large enough to contain sufficient haloes at the high end of our stellar mass range to permit robust statistical testing , and at the same time has a small enough particle mass that haloes at the low mass end are well resolved ( according , for example , to the criteria of  @xcite ) .",
    "we identify haloes using the rockstar halo finder  @xcite .",
    "the simulation contains around 1,000,000 haloes hosting galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath39 .",
    "the overall aim of our method is to create a map between a set of theoretical parameters describing galaxy formation processes and five key properties of the corresponding theoretical fjr and fp .",
    "we do this by generating for particular input parameter values a population of galaxies with stellar masses ( @xmath16 ) , effective radii ( @xmath12 ) , and velocity dispersions averaged over the 1.5  sdss aperture ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we then draw mock data sets from these populations and determine their fjr and fp . by comparing to the observed relations , we assess the aptitude of the models to account for elliptical galaxies velocity dispersions .",
    "the scope of our parametrizations encompasses many of the galaxy formation models under consideration today .",
    "we begin by assigning a stellar mass to each halo in the darksky-400 simulation by abundance matching to the @xmath40 snapshot  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we adopt the am model of  @xcite , which uses a continuous parameter @xmath41 to interpolate proxy between virial mass ( @xmath42 ) and maximum circular velocity @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) at the time of peak mass . a universal gaussian scatter ( which we refer to as the `` am scatter '' ) describes the deviation of the stellar mass  proxy relation from exact monotonicity .",
    "@xcite show that a good fit to the correlation function and satellite fraction of sdss can be obtained in the case @xmath45 , am scatter @xmath46 , and we take these as our fiducial values .",
    "we use the stellar mass function of  @xcite based on single - srsic fits , which is consistent with the stellar mass determinations of the nsa .    each model galaxy is assumed to have a  @xcite mass density profile - band light , so that the luminosity and mass profiles are directly related .",

    "this purely empirical method guarantees that the model galaxies have precisely the same \\{@xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 } distribution as the data to which we will compare them .. ] for reference , the best - fitting power - law mass  size relation ( msr ) is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the median mass of the nsa sample .",
    "the scatter in size is 0.136 dex .",
    "the angular diameter distance is then used to calculate the physical size of the sdss aperture at the location of each galaxy , within which the weighted velocity dispersion @xmath31 is defined .",
    "combined with present day halo virial mass ( @xmath56 ) and concentration , \\{@xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 } form the inputs to the calculation of @xmath31 , which we now perform .    for a given cumulative spherical mass distribution @xmath57 , density distribution @xmath58 , and radial orbit anisotropy profile @xmath59",

    "one possibility is for the dark matter to contract adiabatically  @xcite , but it is also possible for baryons to transfer energy to the halo and cause it to expand instead ( e.g.  @xcite ) . we employ here the same parametrization of these effects as in dw15 : a free , continuous parameter @xmath71 interpolates between the adiabatic contraction prescription of  @xcite ( @xmath72 ) , and an expansion of the same magnitude ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "@xmath74 corresponds to no effect of disc formation , in which case haloes retain their nfw form .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath75 characterises the extent to which stars follow predominantly tangential or radial orbits . @xmath76",
    "describes motion that is purely tangential , @xmath77 isotropic and @xmath78 purely radial . in principle , @xmath75 is not only a function of position within each galaxy , but also varies between galaxies .",
    "canonical studies of anisotropy include  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , and indicate that @xmath75 typically rises in the central regions of ellipticals , and then flattens out or falls slowly towards larger @xmath79 .",
    "variations among galaxies appear to be relatively small and not significantly correlated with other galaxy properties , and in relatively few cases is @xmath75 observed to fall outside the range [ @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "we will therefore assume @xmath75 to be independent of @xmath79 in our models ( equivalently , we use a single effective value averaged over the aperture ) .",
    "in the most general case we allow @xmath75 to be a function of stellar mass but uncorrelated with all other galaxy and halo variables , and give it a universal gaussian scatter @xmath82 among galaxies : @xmath83 .",
    "in section  [ sec : obs ] we calculated the fraction of galaxies in the nsa that are ellipticals according to our selection criteria , as a function of stellar mass .",
    "this must equal the fraction of haloes hosting elliptical galaxies , and only these haloes ought to be included in our mock population . , the elliptical fraction is a function of our early - type cuts .",
    "if less stringent cuts were used , leading to an increase in the elliptical fraction , selection effects would have a weaker impact on the theoretical population .",
    "our model therefore provides an upper limit for the possible effect of selection on the fjr and fp . ]",
    "given that there is still significant theoretical uncertainty in which haloes should be included , we adopt the flexible selection model of dw15 ( in which the motivation and method is spelled out in detail ) . in short ,",
    "we assume early - type galaxies to inhabit haloes that are above average in mass or concentration at a given stellar mass , so that their characteristic velocities are higher .",
    "the strength of this correlation is governed by a free parameter we call the `` selection factor '' : when this parameter takes its largest allowed value ( @xmath84 ) ellipticals are put in the haloes which give the _ largest _",
    "values for @xmath31 at given @xmath16 , and when it is minimised ( @xmath85 ) the correlation between galaxy morphology and halo type is switched off .",
    "we expect from the results of dw15 ( in addition to recent indications in data ; see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) that the selection factor ought to take a value in the upper half of its allowed range .",
    "we begin with the value 1.4 , corresponding to a moderate increase in predicted velocity for ellipticals over the case of random selection .",
    "this completes the description of the inputs to the model : \\{@xmath41 , am scatter , @xmath71 , selection factor } along with a function @xmath86 for setting @xmath87 .",
    "given values for each of these , we are now in a position to calculate @xmath31 for the galaxy in each halo of the elliptical subsample .",
    "since there are @xmath88 haloes , and 16.7 per cent of the nsa galaxies in this mass range were determined to be ellipticals ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) , our theoretical parent population contains around 167,000 objects .",
    "we now describe our procedure for comparing this population with the observational sample in order to evaluate goodness - of - fit and investigate the significance of the model parameters .",
    "we begin by using the model to generate a mock data set with as many galaxies as the observational sample and at the same stellar masses , but with radii and velocity dispersions drawn randomly from the theoretical population .",
    "for consistency with our observational sample , we impose at this stage the requirement @xmath32 .",
    "the stellar masses used in am as well as the sizes and srsic indices we give our mock galaxies all derive from the observed distributions , and hence no correction need be applied to convert between true and observed values of these quantities when comparing the mock and real data .",
    "measurement uncertainties do however play a role in determining @xmath89 for a given mock galaxy , which is a function of the true rather than observed values of @xmath16 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and furthermore is different to the @xmath90 value naturally output by the model . in a rigorously bayesian analysis ,",
    "the true positions of the galaxies in \\{@xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath31 } space would be treated as free parameters with posterior distributions deduced simultaneously with the others . at the maximum likelihood point",
    ", the true positions would lie somewhat closer to the model prediction than the observed positions ( within the measurement uncertainties ) , and hence we would find slightly greater agreement between theory and data .",
    "however , since this analysis is too expensive to perform here we take the true and observed positions to be coincident .",
    "this is justified by the relatively small uncertainties in the measurements of the local nsa galaxies , and is no worse an estimate for the maximum - likelihood values of the true parameters than those derived by randomly scattering the observed values .",
    "we fit to each mock data set a power - law fjr cut .",
    "we are not concerned here with the determination of the fitting parameters themselves , but only their comparison between real and mock data sets .",
    "this requires merely that each data set be treated in the same way .",

    "we then reduce the set \\{@xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath92 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath95 } to 5 _ independent _ parameters by removing duplicate information : the normalisation @xmath99 of the fp contains no information absent from the combination of the normalisation of the msr ( matched by construction ) and that of the fjr ( @xmath97 ) , and one linear combination of @xmath100 and @xmath101 replicates the information in the msr and fjr slopes .",
    "the other degree of freedom , @xmath102 , which we denote by @xmath103 , describes the correlation of the msr and fjr residuals and is a measure of the fp tilt .",

    "we then lift the @xmath77 restriction and consider a model with small radial anisotropies ( favoured by existing data ) , and one in which the effective anisotropy increases with stellar mass .    for each set of parameter values we show a contour plot of the predicted fjr ( fig .  [",

    ". these might be reasonable estimates a priori : the am parameters are those preferred by  @xcite , the @xmath71 choice corresponds to moderate halo contraction , and the selection factor corresponds to a moderate preference for early - type galaxies to inhabit more massive or more concentrated haloes at fixed mass .",
    "the added dark matter , distributed in this way , has four main effects on the fjr and fp :    1 .",
    "the normalisation of the fjr is increased due to the extra dynamical mass .",
    "the velocity dispersions of low - mass galaxies are boosted more than those of high - mass galaxies , making the fjr shallower .",
    "this effect is exacerbated by the strong selection in this model : since the elliptical fraction falls towards lower stellar mass , the effect of selecting only the highest @xmath31 objects to be ellipticals is greatest there .",
    "the scatter of the fjr and ( particularly ) the fp are increased by the addition of halo variables ( @xmath56 and concentration ) into the effective formula for @xmath31 .",
    "these variables themselves have a spread of values at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "the precision with which one can estimate @xmath96 from @xmath12 and @xmath31 is only 1.5 times greater than from @xmath31 alone due to the relative weakening of the correlation between the three observables .",
    "@xmath103 is increased , indicating that @xmath31 varies less rapidly with @xmath12 at fixed @xmath16 than in the no - dm case .",
    "now that @xmath31 is set largely by the halo ( and under our assumption that @xmath12 is independent of halo properties ) , the dependence of @xmath31 on surface brightness is reduced .",
    "we now consider the effect of individual changes to the model parameters .",
    "we note first that varying @xmath41 within reasonable bounds ( @xmath112 ;  @xcite ) has very little effect on any of our diagnostics . when @xmath41 is larger , the rank of a halo in am is conditioned more by its concentration than its virial mass , making the haloes of our high-@xmath16 galaxies more concentrated and less massive on average . however , the total dark matter mass within the aperture , which is responsible for setting @xmath31 , is only slightly larger at high @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the halo proxy has a significantly weaker effect on the fjr here than on the tfr in dw15 .",
    "this is because in dw15 velocities were measured at larger radius , so the ratio of enclosed dark matter to baryonic mass was larger and the choice of halo proxy had a larger effect .",
    "in addition , while the squared tfr circular velocity is directly proportional to the enclosed dark matter mass , the fjr aperture velocity dispersion is determined by a set of three differential equations that depend non - trivially on density and cumulative mass .",
    "the result is a washing out of the subtle effect of the am proxy .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath110 for the remainder of this work .",
    "the effects of variations in the other three model parameters are shown in rows four to six of table  [ tab : table ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : fjr_scatt][fig : fjr_sel ] , and may be accounted for as follows .",
    "* the most significant effect of the am scatter is on the scatter of the fjr and fp .",
    "increasing the am scatter increases the spread of halo properties assigned to galaxies of a given @xmath16 , and hence the spread of the resulting velocity dispersions .",
    "a higher scatter also flattens the fjr ; since the halo mass function is a falling function of mass , high am scatter tends to associate lower mass haloes with galaxies at a given high @xmath16 .",
    "finally , increasing the am scatter reduces @xmath103 . *",
    "@xmath71 largely sets the normalisation of the fjr : the lower it is , the more dark matter is expelled from the inner regions of a galaxy , and hence the lower @xmath31 .",
    "the normalisation of the fjr can be reconciled with that of the data by setting @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , lowering @xmath71 tends to reduce the rate at which @xmath31 falls as @xmath12 rises , as manifest by an increase in @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath114 , more compact galaxies ( i.e. lower @xmath12 at fixed @xmath16 ) pull more dm into the inner regions , boosting the rate at which @xmath31 rises as @xmath12 falls .",
    "conversely , when @xmath115 more compact galaxies _ expel _ more dm from their inner regions , mitigating the rise in @xmath31 due to the baryonic mass as @xmath12 falls . *",
    "a larger selection factor preferentially puts elliptical galaxies in more massive or more concentrated haloes at given @xmath16 , increasing the normalisation of the fjr and reducing its scatter .",
    "since the elliptical fraction falls towards low @xmath16 , selection effects have largest impact in the low - mass regime , and hence increasing the selection factor lowers the fjr slope .",
    "table  [ tab : table ] shows that the predicted @xmath98 and @xmath97 are brought into better agreement with the data by adopting @xmath116 and selection factor = @xmath117 .",
    "we display the results of such a model in figs .",
    "[ fig : fjr_opt ] and  [ fig : rescorr_opt ] , and row seven of table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "we focus hereafter on the case \\{@xmath118 , am scatter = 0.16 , @xmath116 , selection factor = @xmath117}.      all models examined so far have assumed @xmath120 . we now consider two models where this constraint is relaxed , the first in which a @xmath75 value for each galaxy is drawn from a normal distribution with fixed mean @xmath87 and standard deviation @xmath82 , and the second in which @xmath87 is a function of @xmath16",
    ".    detailed kinematic studies of ellipticals suggest that @xmath75 is typically fairly independent of radius and takes a value around 0.3 with an inter - galaxy scatter of roughly @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "the results of a model with @xmath122 , separately for each mock galaxy , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fjr_3beta ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : rescorr_3beta ] and row eight of table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "this model agrees fairly well with the data in terms of both @xmath92 and @xmath103 , and the large effect of @xmath75 demonstrates its crucial importance in any study aimed at uncovering the theoretical significance of elliptical galaxy scaling relations .",
    "we distinguish and explain the effects of @xmath87 and @xmath82 as follows .    1 .",
    "all else being equal , the larger a galaxy s @xmath75 , the greater its @xmath31 .",
    "this is because larger @xmath75 corresponds to more radial stellar motions , which provide a larger contribution to @xmath60 and hence @xmath67 ( eqs .",
    "thus @xmath97 rises with @xmath87 .",
    "a larger @xmath75 increases @xmath31 for smaller galaxies more than it does for larger ones . increasing",
    "@xmath87 therefore increases the average @xmath31 of galaxies at fixed @xmath16 and low @xmath12 more than those at the same @xmath16 but high @xmath12 , reducing @xmath103 .",
    "3 .   at small @xmath12 , a large",
    "@xmath75 increases @xmath31 more than a small @xmath75 decreases it , and vice versa at large @xmath12 . hence increasing @xmath82 at",
    "fixed @xmath87 increases the average @xmath31 of galaxies at fixed @xmath16 and low @xmath12 , while decreasing it at high @xmath12 .",
    "the result is a decrease in @xmath103 .",
    "4 .   since @xmath75 is assumed to be uncorrelated with galaxy or halo properties , the effect of @xmath82 roughly sums in quadrature with the other sources of scatter to increase @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "we now consider a simple toy model in which @xmath87 depends on @xmath16 .",
    "this is motivated by the observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : fjr_cont ] and table  [ tab : table ] that none of the model refinements made so far have had a significant effect on the _ slope _ of the fjr , which has remained in all cases too low .",
    "we therefore show in figs .",

    "and @xmath75 tends to fall slowly with @xmath125 beyond a certain point ( e.g.  @xcite ) . ]",
    "the fjr slope in this model is increased to that in the data , and furthermore @xmath95 is reduced .",
    "however , the model fjr has acquired a curvature not present in the data , and @xmath103 is significantly increased . within our parameter space , the fjr curvature could be reduced only by setting @xmath87 even lower at @xmath28 ( @xmath75 can never exceed 1 ) , which would further increase @xmath103 and necessitate an increase in @xmath71 to mitigate the fall in @xmath97 . we therefore conclude that introducing a dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath16 does not offer a particularly attractive prospect for further improving fjr and fp predictions .    note that a positive @xmath87 and @xmath82 would increase the predicted fjr intercept and scatter also in the no - dm case , bringing it into better agreement with the data , and including a positive @xmath87 dependence on @xmath16 would increase the slope . within the broader parameter space opened up by the anisotropy ,",
    "it is not clear therefore that the no - dm model can be excluded by the fjr alone .",
    "now that all the parameters of our model have been introduced and their effects described , we discuss their degeneracies .",
    "the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath87 and the selection factor have a degenerate effect on the normalisation of the fjr .",
    "there is also a strong degeneracy between the am scatter and @xmath82 , both of which predominantly affect @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "however , strong prior constraints exist on the am scatter  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , so we have chosen to fix its value here .",
    "we note however , that although most current measurements are consistent with a constant value or weak trend of am scatter with mass , the constraints weaken significantly at low mass . finally ,",
    "the selection factor , am scatter and effective dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath16 are degenerate in their effect on @xmath98 , and @xmath71 , @xmath82 and the am scatter are degenerate in determining @xmath103 .",
    "alternative sets of parameter values capable of adequately reproducing the observed @xmath97 , @xmath92 and @xmath103 are therefore likely to exist .",
    "we have investigated a series of am - based models , which have previously been shown to match several spatial statistics of galaxies , in order to assess the extent to which important characteristics of the faber  jackson relation and fundamental plane are expected in contemporary galaxy formation scenarios . while some aspects of the relations ( the normalisation and scatter of the fjr , and the rate of change of velocity with size at fixed mass ) may be satisfactorily accounted for , others ( the fjr slope and fp scatter ) are challenging to match with our approach . in section  [ sec : contraction ] we discuss our preference for halo expansion in the context of previous findings in the literature , in section  [ sec : selection ] we comment on the possibility that early - type galaxies tend to inhabit more massive or more concentrated haloes at given stellar mass , and in section  [ sec : discrepancies ] we elaborate on the discrepancy in the fp scatter and consider potential solutions .      in order to obtain the correct magnitude of the aperture velocity dispersions , we require moderate expansion of haloes in response to disc formation ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this roughly agrees with the tfr calculations in dw15 , which favour @xmath126 for mass - based am and @xmath113 for the more realistic case of velocity - based matching .",
    "these results may be considered an extension of the cusp ",
    "core  @xcite and too big to fail  @xcite problems to higher mass : the nfw profile with a canonical mass - concentration relation puts too much dark matter in the central regions of @xmath127 galaxies .    the necessity of halo expansion has already been noted by several observational and theoretical studies of early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that reproducing the low normalisation , scatter and curvature of the fp requires either that the haloes surrounding ellipticals have significantly lower mass or concentration than predicted by @xmath5-body simulations , or that they are substantially cored .",
    "@xcite observe keplerian fall - off of the velocity dispersion profiles of three bright ellipticals , indicating a low dark matter fraction out to a significant radius . indeed",
    ", many studies indicate that dark matter constitutes only a small fraction of the total mass in the central regions of ellipticals ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , since the majority of ellipticals under investigation here are high surface brightness systems , our findings add to the growing body of evidence that higher stellar surface mass density implies lower enclosed dark matter mass  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is found from the slope of the nsa msr that the surface mass density at @xmath12 falls on average as @xmath16 increases , while fig .",
    "[ fig : fjr_nodm ] demonstrates that the inferred dark matter mass rises .",
    "while `` bottom up '' studies prioritising detailed treatment of the data over cosmological predictions typically find evidence for low or negligible dark matter fractions in the central regions , several `` top down '' studies that start from a cosmological model argue that halo _",
    "contraction _ is required in order to fit the fjr normalisation .",
    "we discuss two .",
    "@xcite compile a set of dynamical mass measurements at 10 kpc from the centres of elliptical galaxies , and combine this with tfr observations to create a single luminosity ",
    "velocity data set .",
    "they find that elliptical galaxies tend to have larger circular velocities than spirals at fixed luminosity .",
    "taking the theoretical prediction to be the halo plus baryon velocities at 10 kpc after am , they argue that halo contraction is necessary to reproduce the observations . comparing the measured nsa fjr presented here to standard tully  fisher relations ( e.g. that of  @xcite ) , we on the other hand find the fjr to have a lower normalisation and higher slope . only at the very largest stellar masses ( @xmath128 )",
    "do the elliptical galaxy aperture velocity dispersions exceed the spiral galaxy @xmath129 values .",
    "@xcite combine a number of empirical power - law correlations relating galaxy size , gas content , halo virial mass , and halo concentration with stellar mass to generate a mock tfr and fjr .",
    "they do not in fact solve the jeans equation to model @xmath31 , but instead adopt an average empirical relation between the circular velocity at @xmath12 ( which is output by their model ) and the velocity dispersion there , and an additional relation between that and the integrated velocity dispersion within the sdss aperture .",
    "their fiducial model with halo contraction generates an fjr with slope and intercept in almost perfect agreement with their data , i.e. with a considerably lower normalisation and higher slope than ours .",
    "the differences between our results and those of  @xcite may be largely attributable to the use of different stellar - to - halo mass ratios : where  @xcite employs a compilation of satellite kinematics and weak lensing observations , we use abundance matching . by direct comparison , we find that our halo masses are around @xmath130 dex higher at fixed @xmath16 , resulting in an increased need to move dark matter out of the central regions in order to match the fjr normalisation .",
    "these differences are within the uncertainties of direct measurements of the stellar - to - halo mass ratio ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but have an important effect of mass modelling .",
    "the choice of imf is another important systematic .",
    "the chabrier imf that we use is among the lightest of those considered routinely in the literature for early - type galaxies ; adopting the heavier kroupa or salpeter imf would increase stellar masses and hence reduce the inferred dark matter mass .",
    "imf studies in the literature may be settling on a non - universal imf for early - type galaxies which increases roughly linearly from chabrier at @xmath131 to salpeter at @xmath132 ( @xcite ;  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "significantly , it is found not only that this imf favours low central dark matter fractions ( @xmath133 per cent ) , but also that the stellar mass fundamental plane is then fully consistent with the virial plane @xmath134 , with zero scatter .",
    "this suggest that were we to adopt this imf in our analysis we would find the data to be in agreement with our no - dm prediction ; in particular , the @xmath98 and @xmath95 values measured from the data would be significantly reduced , and @xmath103 increased .",
    "changing the imf would also affect the fjr and fp output by our model , since greater stellar masses at the bright end correspond to larger stellar mass fractions with the halo mass function fixed . however , predicted velocities would increase along with the stellar masses , causing a shift roughly along the fjr and hence impacting the predicted relations less than the observed ones .",
    "the non - universal imf of  @xcite would therefore still require @xmath135 .",
    "more generally , while the choice of imf may affect any of the fjr or fp diagnostics in table  [ tab : table ] , the true imf is very unlikely to generate a higher fp scatter in the data .",
    "hence the @xmath95 discrepancy could not be eliminated in this way .",
    "additional sources of discrepancy between our results and those of  @xcite and  @xcite may include a potential systematic error associated with combining incommensurate @xmath31 and @xmath136 measurements ( measured at different radii and governed by qualitatively different equations ) , and an offset between data and model velocity dispersions when the latter are not derived from jeans analysis .",
    "we stress the importance of measuring velocities in precisely the same way in real and mock galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that  @xcite assume galaxy and halo variables to be correlated with @xmath16 only , while we include also their expected and observed correlations with one another .",
    "there is no guarantee that these covariances are insignificant .",
    "@xcite argue that simultaneously matching the normalisation of the tfr and fjr requires that early - type galaxies either experience stronger halo contraction in response to disc formation than late - types , or have a heavier imf .",
    "we note that the relative amount of halo contraction or expansion required by spirals and ellipticals depends on whether the two types of galaxies are placed in haloes of systematically different mass or concentration .",
    "this effect is included in our framework via the selection factor .",
    "the higher the selection factor , the stronger the expansion required for ellipticals relative to spirals .",
    "in particular , we find that a high selection factor ( i.e. the haloes of more elliptical galaxies have more mass in the central regions at fixed @xmath16 ) favours @xmath137 for spirals ( dw15 ) , and @xmath138 for ellipticals ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fjr_nu ] and row five of table  [ tab : table ] ) , while random selection ( selection factor = arctan(0.5 ) ) favours @xmath138 for spirals and @xmath137 for ellipticals .",
    "selection effects are important in any attempt to model the dynamics of spiral and elliptical galaxies within the same framework .",
    "our model assumes that the dependence of the halo expansion factor on @xmath16 is the same as that of adiabatic contraction , viz .",
    ", maximised at @xmath139 where @xmath140 is largest . while this dependence is motivated in the case of contraction ( @xmath141 ) , there is no guarantee that it would be preserved by the baryonic feedback processes presumed to cause halo expansion in the case @xmath135 .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig : fjr_opt ] and  [ fig : fjr_3beta ] that to bring the predicted fjr slope into better agreement with the observations would require even more expansion at @xmath139 relative to @xmath142 where the baryon fraction is very low .",
    "expansion schemes which act to flatten cusps at intermediate @xmath140 ( e.g.  @xcite ) would not help here .",
    "the sensitivity of our halo response to @xmath140 makes our constraint on @xmath71 dependent on our being able to probe lower stellar masses ; for the very highest mass galaxies some halo contraction may be permitted .",
    "two potential alternatives to halo expansion would require only slight deviation from our assumptions .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath143 or @xmath144 is too large , resulting in haloes of too high mass or concentration being generated by the @xmath5-body simulation .",
    "however , we showed in appendix b of dw15 that a significant effect on galaxy velocities would require these variables to change by more than their cosmological uncertainties ( a conclusion also reached by  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the am model could be changed to modify the relation between stellar mass and halo mass and concentration . in particular , lowering the normalisation of the fjr would require galaxies in the range @xmath145 to lie in less massive or less concentrated haloes , and steepening the relation would require this effect to be larger at @xmath146 than @xmath147 . however , this effect would have to be large to affect @xmath97 and @xmath98 significantly : it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fjr_nodm ] there is little need for dark matter at @xmath139 , and hence @xmath56 would have to be lowered to near @xmath16 to obtain agreement here . at @xmath142 , we estimate that @xmath56 would have to be increased by a factor of @xmath148 , or halo concentrations by @xmath149 per cent , to increase @xmath31 by 0.1 dex .",
    "@xcite construct a framework in which to constrain the stellar mass dependence of the imf and halo response to disk formation using the slope and normalisation of the fjr and the tilt of the fp ( our @xmath98 , @xmath97 and @xmath103 statistics ) . in agreement with our analysis",
    ", they find that a universal value of the imf and @xmath71 underpredicts the fjr slope , and that a baryon - only ( mass follows light ) model with imf slightly heavier than chabrier best accounts for @xmath31 at low @xmath16 .",
    "halo contraction is disfavoured for @xmath150 , but may be allowed at higher mass provided the imf is sufficiently light .",
    "the value they derive for the tilt of the observed fp is dissimilar to ours , and in particular lies on the other side of the virial value @xmath151 .",
    "this may be due to different sample selection ( our cuts on srsic index and light concentration are replaced by one on colour , and they go out to a higher redshift @xmath152 ) , different baryonic mass modelling ( they use a de vaucouleurs plus exponential fit where we take a general srsic index @xmath13 ) , or different stellar mass determinations .",
    "nevertheless we agree that the strong dependence of @xmath31 on halo variables induced by contracted or nfw haloes washes out the fp tilt to an unacceptable level , and hence overpredicts @xmath103 .",
    "we note that while indeed the average radial orbit anisotropy @xmath87 has only a small effect on @xmath97 and @xmath103 within the range of its observed values , the variation among galaxies , @xmath153 , is less well constrained a priori and may have a larger effect .",
    "we note finally that further insight into the shape of dark matter density profiles in this stellar mass range may come from combining precise probes of the inner regions ( e.g. aperture velocity dispersion ) with measurements of the large - scale mass distribution from weak lensing .",
    "while some analyses of this type have already been performed ( e.g.  @xcite ) , these studies can be significantly expanded and improved with the current generation of large photometric surveys such as des and hsc .",
    "we have found that lowering the selection factor  that is , reducing the relative preference for ellipticals to live in more massive or more concentrated haloes at fixed @xmath16  improves the model prediction of the fjr slope , intercept and scatter , as well as the average rate at which @xmath31 varies with @xmath12 at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "the opposite was argued for by dw15 from the normalisation of the tfr . taken in combination ,",
    "these results suggest a scenario in which the overall dark matter mass in _ all _ galaxies is reduced ( e.g. by halo expansion ) , rather than one in which the two types of galaxy populate haloes with markedly different dynamical properties .",
    "it does however remain possible to situate early - types in more massive haloes by increasing the degree of their halo expansion .",
    "a natural next step would be to model these two populations and their selection simultaneously in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "we have found two of our five fjr and fp diagnostics intractable within our framework : the fjr slope @xmath98 and the fp scatter @xmath95 . while the slope prediction may be improved by a more sophisticated model for radial orbit anisotropy @xmath75 , a more realistic imf , or a change to the mass - dependence of halo expansion , the discrepancy in the fp scatter likely points to a deeper problem with the model .",
    "we discuss this issue here .",
    "a number of authors have suggested previously that the scatter in the fp predicted by @xmath0cdm is too large ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; our contribution is to quantify these claims precisely within the am framework .",
    "when galaxies are situated in haloes , scatter in halo mass and concentration at fixed @xmath31 and @xmath12 provide additional scatter in @xmath16 : roughly , @xmath154 is increased by @xmath155 ( see table  [ tab : table ] ) .",
    "further , in all of our models that include dark matter ( rows three to nine of table  [ tab : table ] ) , the reduction in scatter in progressing from the fjr to the fp is much lower than in the data . in the presence of a halo , the relative dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath12",
    "is reduced , and hence so too is the increase in the precision with which velocity may be determined when its mean dependence on size is accounted for in the optimum way .    we have assumed that galaxy size is correlated only with stellar mass and srsic index , and not separately with halo properties at a given stellar mass and profile .",
    "thus varying @xmath12 at fixed @xmath16 ( and @xmath66 ) affects only the baryonic mass within the aperture and leaves the dark matter mass unchanged .",
    "the failure of our models to match the observed fp scatter while at the same time performing well in terms of @xmath92 and @xmath103 suggests a correlation between galaxy size and halo properties that we have not included .",
    "we note for example that  @xcite have shown that galaxy half - mass radius is tightly correlated with halo mass , though it is unclear from that work whether this is true at fixed stellar mass .",
    "one such possibility for an underlying correlation between size and halo properties was explored in dw15 , where size was determined by the assumption that galaxy and halo specific angular momentum are proportional .",
    "this correlation acts to increase the rate at which @xmath156 falls as @xmath4 rises , since larger galaxies end up in less concentrated haloes at fixed @xmath16 and halo spin .",
    "a model along these lines would therefore likely reduce @xmath95 ( since the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath12 would be strengthened relative to its dependence on halo properties that do not appear in the fp ) , and decrease @xmath103 . since predicted and observed @xmath103 values agree under the empirical size model implemented here , this would run the risk of making @xmath103 too negative .",
    "this could perhaps be remedied by reducing @xmath82 , but at the price of predicting too low an fjr scatter .",
    "furthermore , this type of correlation between @xmath12 and halo spin was shown in dw15 to overpredict the scatter in size at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "an alternative approach would be to start with the observed values of @xmath12 , as we have done here , but correlate @xmath12 explicitly with a halo property such as spin or concentration at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "this is a form of conditional abundance matching  @xcite , and would retain the feature of matching the msr by construction .",
    "although it may be possible to find such a correlation that reduces @xmath95 , this method lacks both the theoretical motivation of the dw15 approach and the simplicity of the empirical method presented here .",
    "this is worth exploring but we leave it for further work .",
    "we note that previous semi - empirical models of elliptical galaxy dynamics such as those of  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite do not incorporate significant correlations between galaxy and halo properties beyond those investigated here .",
    "if we are right that matching the fp scatter requires such a correlation , it follows that these models too would disagree with the fp in detail .",
    "ultimately , hydrodynamical simulations may be necessary to identify and understand all dynamically - relevant correlations of galaxy and halo variables .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) and faber  jackson relation ( fjr ) of elliptical galaxies provide an important theoretical testing ground , and contain information on galaxy formation processes unlikely to be found elsewhere .",
    "we have isolated five key characteristics of these relations and investigated the extent to which they are expected on the basis of a generalised abundance matching model in concordance @xmath0cdm . comparing to a large and homogeneously - selected sample of elliptical galaxies from the nasa - sloan atlas , our main findings are the following .    1 .",
    "the magnitude of observed velocity dispersions indicates on average a small amount of dark matter within the central regions of ellipticals with @xmath157 . the discrepancy with the prediction of a baryon - only model rises at higher stellar mass , reaching @xmath158 dex at @xmath159 .",
    "2 .   situating galaxies within the haloes produced by an @xmath5-body simulation using currently - favoured cosmological parameter values causes an overprediction of their velocity dispersions , unless dark matter is removed from the central regions . in the context of our framework , successfully matching the normalisation of the fjr requires a degree of halo expansion in response to disc formation similar to that required by  @xcite for agreement with the tully  fisher relation .",
    "abundance matching naturally predicts an fjr slope shallower than that observed .",
    "this discrepancy may potentially be accounted for by a variation in either effective radial orbit anisotropy or halo expansion factor with stellar mass , or may indicate non - universality in the imf .",
    "4 .   across the parameter space spanned by our framework ,",
    "the scatter predicted around the fp is significantly too high compared to the observations .",
    "this may indicate the presence of correlations between galaxy and halo variables not included in our models .",
    ".   the rate at which velocity dispersion varies with size at fixed @xmath16 is a measure of the tilt of the fp .",
    "we demonstrate that the observed non - homology of elliptical galaxies ( in this case , the variation of srsic index with @xmath16 and @xmath12 ) , coupled with the variations in dynamical mass - to - light ratio generated by abundance matching , are sufficient to account for this key statistic .",
    "this is true in detail , however , only when the anisotropy of stellar motions is accounted for .",
    "there are several directions in which this work could be taken .",
    "first , it is important to understand the correlation between galaxy size and halo properties implied by the small scatter in the fundamental plane",
    ". this could be achieved either by exploring the output of hydrodynamical simulations which produce galaxies of realistic size , or by creating toy models in which correlations can be varied and constrained manually .",
    "second , the parameters of our framework have implications for various statistics of the large - scale galaxy distribution , including galaxy clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing , and combining such analyses with dynamical modelling in a single self - consistent framework may be expected to considerably reduce the remaining uncertainties . finally , in this work and  @xcite we have treated early and late - type galaxies separately ; future tests of galaxy formation models should do both together .",
