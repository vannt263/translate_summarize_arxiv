    "increasing interest is attracted by modified versions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "they have been proposed as serious alternatives to einstein s theory of gravitation , and could be used to describe more accurately the observed accelerated expansion of our universe @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown @xcite that it is actually possible to reconstruct the explicit form of the postulated curvature function @xmath0 , from the universe expansion history .",
    "it is quite well known that modified versions of general relativity are mathematically equivalent to scalar fields models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , meaning that a solution in a modified gravity model can always be mapped into a solution of the corresponding scalar field theory . in spite of this mathematical correspondence , physical equivalence does not always follow .",
    "in fact , two corresponding solutions of two equivalent theories can actually exhibit rather different physical behaviors .",
    "furthermore , it is not necessary , in order to justify modified gravity , to do it by always using this relation with scalar field theories . because of the new situation , in the following we will disregard this mathematical equivalence and do consider in our analysis modified gravity as an independent theory aiming directly at some measurable physical properties .",
    "what is more , in our treatment modified gravity will in fact be viewed just as a different classical theory of gravitation .",
    "although other models have been considered @xcite with the gauss - bonnet scalar in the action , here we shall restrict our attention to pure @xmath0 models .",
    "as often discussed , there are limitations on the function @xmath0 when trying to construct a theory which is in agreement with the very precise solar system tests carried out so far , as well as with all the known cosmological bounds @xcite . recently",
    ", different models of that kind have been studied @xcite , the last three of them having been reported to pass all solar system tests ; in addition , they exhibit a number of very interesting features . in @xcite",
    "possible newton law corrections to such models have been considered .",
    "we present here an analysis of the models above based on the study of pure schwarzschild and also schwarzschild - de sitter black holes ( sbh , sdsbh ) , calculated through use of the noether charge method .",
    "we start with a discussion of two examples considered in @xcite and go over to study more recent ones @xcite .",
    "the direct confrontation of basic quantities , as the black hole entropy , with the well established , classical ( einsteinian ) result can offer a further insight into the construction of a general @xmath0 theory .",
    "we start with a short review of modified @xmath0 gravity and the noether charge method to compute the bh entropy and then calculate the bh entropy for the models in refs .  @xcite .",
    "after that , we extend our analysis to the models @xcite , taking due care of the sign of the bh entropy and also discussing the stability conditions as well as the existence of a schwarzschild bh solution",
    ". we conclude by providing a brief comparison of the different models considered .",
    "the action for @xmath0 gravity ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) is @xmath1 with @xmath0 a generic function . as discussed in @xcite , in order to give rise to a realistic cosmology this function needs to fulfill some limiting conditions . however , for the moment we can ignore them , because they do not affect the considerations which will follow",
    ". the equations of motion for this theory , in the presence of matter , are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the matter stress energy tensor . contracting the indices in the last equation",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath4 since we are interested in the study of the schwarzschild solution ( in the case when there is a @xmath5 solution ) or either in schwarzschild - de sitter black holes , we restrict our reasoning to the case of metric tensors with constant scalar curvature in the vacuum . in that case",
    ", we simply have @xcite @xmath6 for completeness , let us recall that , in order to build a realistic modified gravity , @xmath0 needs satisfy the two conditions : @xmath7 the first condition corresponds to the existence of an effective cosmological constant at high curvature .",
    "the second one allows for vacuum solutions , as for example minkowski or schwarzschild space - times .",
    "then , although an effective cosmological constant exists , vacuum solution are preserved and it is legitimate to study them also in a large scale universe with nonzero @xmath8 . moreover , in order to give rise to stable solutions @xcite , the following additional condition needs to be fulfilled : @xmath9/f''(r ) > r.\\ ] ] we can now consider the schwarzschild - de sitter metric , a spherically symmetric solution of ( [ eq2 ] ) with constant curvature @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will use the noether charge method , as discussed in @xcite , in order to calculate the entropy for the schwarzschild - de sitter bh .",
    "the entropy formula reads @xmath14 and the integration is made on the external horizon of events surface . in the case of constant curvature , for a generic modified theory , the result is @xmath15 a_h/4g,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the area of the bh horizon .",
    "this enables us to calculate the bh entropy for a generic @xmath0 theory .",
    "we must here stress the fact that the requirement of positive black hole entropy simply avoids the appearance of ghost or tachyon fields in the corresponding scalar field theory .",
    "then a negative entropy is simply a footprint of some instabilities in the einstein frame .",
    "what is new in this picture is that we do not need to involve the ( mathematical ) equivalence of these models in order to give a physically meaningful interpretation of such constrain .",
    "in order to illustrate the method with explicit examples of entropy calculation , we analyze here two modified gravity models that appeared some time ago and which have been quite successful up to now . in those models",
    "no @xmath5 solution occurs . the first one , introduced in @xcite , is given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the condition to obtain a sdsbh ( namely , @xmath19 ) leads to @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{10 mm } = 2 \\left [ - a\\left(r_0 - \\lambda_1 \\right)^{-n } + b \\left ( r_0 - \\lambda_2 \\right)^m \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that we have for the entropy @xmath21.\\ ] ] thus the sdsbh entropy is positive for all @xmath22 .",
    "the second model , studied in @xcite , is defined by @xmath23 this modified gravity model does not admit vacuum solutions , thus we can calculate the entropy for the sdsbh .",
    "the ricci scalar is such that it satisfies the relation @xmath24 the sdsbh entropy is given by @xmath25 and turns out to be positive for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "we now analyze three recent models @xcite which have been proven to comply with the solar - system as well as with other cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "their respective authors have given a complete discussion of each model , taking care to provide a range for the free parameters contained in the @xmath0 function , and have also produced stable solutions .",
    "here we just want to stress , with the help of these examples , how the corresponding bh entropy calculation offers a further tool in order to confront each of those modified gravity theories with einstein s general relativity , given the fact that the presence of spherically symmetric bh solutions is a necessary element of all local tests .",
    "in this model @xcite ( with @xmath27 ) we have @xmath28 in @xcite , @xmath29 is chosen such that , at cosmological scale , @xmath30 at the present epoch , and @xmath0 satisfies the condition @xmath31 for @xmath30 .",
    "this also ensure that solutions with @xmath30 are stable .",
    "moreover the requirement that @xmath32 at fixed @xmath33 gives a cosmological constant , in both cosmological and local tests of gravity . in spite of this fact , since @xmath34 ,",
    "this theory admits the schwarzschild solution ( i.e. @xmath5 ) . by the way we note that the stability condition for the vacuum solution is not satisfied unless @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , except of this case , vacuum solutions ( than also sbh ) are unstable .",
    "note also that @xmath35 corresponds to a lagrangian @xmath37 for small @xmath8 , so it is associated with a correction to the gravitational coupling constant for small @xmath8 , giving an effective @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the entropy formula gives for the sds metric @xmath39 the entropy for the schwarzschild solution is @xmath40 then , in the only stable case , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , a correction to the classical einstenian bh entropy is found . from ( [ entropyhu ] ) it also follows that , for sds bh with @xmath41 , the entropy is positive and corrections to its einstenian value are of order @xmath42 .      in this model @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath43^{-n } -1 \\right\\},\\ ] ] from where @xmath44^{-n-1}.\\ ] ] note that in this case @xmath45 an thus , although this model admits a sbh solution , it is unstable together with all its vacuum solutions . in @xcite",
    "the author limits his analysis to solutions that satisfy the following stability conditions @xmath46 we can therefore consider the sdsbh solutions , with curvature @xmath10 given by @xmath47^{-n-1 } + 1 \\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{10 mm }   = - 2 \\lambda c",
    "\\left [ \\left ( 1+(r_0/c)^2 \\right)^{-n } -1 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that satisfies also ( [ stabilitistarobinski ] ) . in this case , the entropy is just @xmath48^{-n-1 }      \\right\\}.\\ ] ] therefore , in this case a _ non trivial _ correction of the sdsbh entropy is found .",
    "we just stress the fact that the sbh solutions have classical entropy but are _ unstable _ , and that the sdsbh ones have a modified entropy which , under the limitations stated in @xcite , is strictly positive .      here",
    "@xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath49/2a\\ ] ] and @xmath50/2.\\ ] ] this model admits a sbh solution .",
    "the entropy for the sdsbh is simply @xmath51 a_h/8g.\\ ] ] we can use the stability condition given in @xcite , @xmath52 , to obtain @xmath53 for the sbh , the stability condition is just @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , being @xmath31 for all @xmath8 , in this model the vacuum solutions are always stable and there are no substantial corrections to the classical result .      it is interesting to put together all three models and explicitly compare the behavior of the function @xmath0 , in particular , the stability of the euclidean limit and the asymptotic behavior at large curvature . to simplify the comparison , we do not play with the values of the different parameters and set all coefficients equal to 1 and the curvature powers equal to 2 or 4 . for the case of the hu - sawicki model , with @xmath55 being @xmath56 , the corresponding plot is given in fig .  1 .    for the case of the starobinsky model , with @xmath57 being @xmath58",
    ", we obtain fig .  2 .    and",
    "for the case of the appleby - battye model , with @xmath59 being @xmath60 and @xmath61 , fig .  3 .",
    "in a first comparison of these different models , we note that the one of starobinsky , as remarked by the author himself @xcite , has unstable vacuum solutions .",
    "this seems true also for the hu - sawicki model , except for the case when @xmath62 , that leads to a negative and infinite bh entropy .",
    "the appleby - battye model has the important property to possess stable vacuum solutions for a suitable range of the free parameters .",
    "it also yields an unmodified expression of the bh entropy .",
    "very recently , a modified gravity model has been published @xcite , that unifies inflation and cosmic acceleration under the same picture and also complies with the solar system tests .",
    "it is @xmath63 dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a constant given by @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the ricci scalar at present .",
    "the effective cosmological constant in the early universe is simply @xmath69 and the present cosmological constant is @xmath70 . because of the fact that @xmath34 , this model allows for sbh . to be general ,",
    "we first calculate the sdsbh entropy , which is given by @xmath71 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the sdsbh curvature that fulfills condition ( 4 ) .",
    "thus , black holes are less entropic than in einstein s theory . for the sbh",
    ", we have @xmath72 note that the stability condition is here @xmath31 , thus @xmath73 to have stability for sbh , we need that @xmath74 this can be considered , together with the condition @xmath75 stated in @xcite , to avoid newton law corrections in our solar system and on the earth surroundings .",
    "comparison of bh entropy in modified gravity theories and in the usual einstenian gravity case have been carried out .",
    "we have here analyzed different suitable models , recently considered in the literature , and have shown explicitly how corrections to the ` classical ' bh entropy can in fact appear .",
    "we have also argued that the condition of positive entropy can be used as an extra condition in order to constrain the viability of modified gravity theories .",
    "of course this conditions is equivalent to the requirement that neither ghost nor tachyon fields appear in the equivalent scalar field models .",
    "anyhow , if referred to the bh entropy , this condition has a direct interpretation in the framework of modified gravity , without needing to pass through the ( mathematically but not physically equivalent ) scalar field theories .",
    "we hope that this quite simple considerations may be useful for future analysis .",
    "we thank sergei odintsov for helpful discussions .",
