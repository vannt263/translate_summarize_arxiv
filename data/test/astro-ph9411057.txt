    "in the last few years a new generation of models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy has started to appear , in which also the dynamics of the system is taken into account ( e.g. sommer - larsen & yoshii 1990 , chamcham & tayler 1994 , hensler , this volume , and references therein ) . this new class of models can provide a complete scenario for the evolution of the milky way but is still in a rather preliminary phase .",
    "the aim of this presentation is then to review the current state of _ standard _",
    "models for the chemical evolution of the galactic disk , with particular emphasis on the effect of gas accretion on the element abundances and gradients .",
    "these models are quite successful in accounting for the large scale - long term phenomena taking place in the galaxy , and reproduce its major observed features , such as the age - metallicity relation and the g - dwarf distribution in the solar neighbourhood , the elemental and isotopic abundances and ratios , the present star formation rate , gas and total mass densities . to avoid misleading conclusions ,",
    "it is however necessary to test the models by comparing their predictions not only with the observational constraints derived for the solar neighbourhood but also with the data relative to other galactic regions ; first of all because the solar neighbourhood is not representative of the whole disk , and secondly because the distribution with galactocentric distance of several quantities provides important information on the history of the milky way .    the current rate of star formation ( sfr )",
    "represents an excellent example of the importance of modeling the whole disk .",
    "one of the most popular approximations for the sfr is a linear proportionality with the gas density , and some authors consider it not only a simple and intuitive law , but also a realistic one because it can reproduce several properties observed in the solar neighbourhood objects . since the observed radial distribution of the gas in the disk is rather flat ( see the shaded area in the bottom panel of fig.2 ) , this approximation inevitably implies a flat radial distribution of the present sfr .",
    "however , lacey & fall ( 1985 ) have shown that the current sfr in the disk , derived from a large sample of young objects ( pulsars , o - stars , etc . ) , is actually a steep decreasing function of the galactocentric distance .",
    "thus , the radial distribution predicted by models assuming a sfr linearly proportional to the gas density is totally inconsistent with the observed one . on the contrary ,",
    "models assuming the sfr proportional to both the gas and the total mass densities ( e.g. tosi 1982 and 1988 , matteucci & franois 1989 , hereinafter mf ) are in agreement with the observed trend , thanks to the steep decrease of the total mass density with galactic radius .",
    "the idea of a long - lasting infall of metal poor gas on the galactic disk was first suggested by larson ( 1972 ) and lynden - bell ( 1975 ) to solve several inconsistencies of the first simple models : a too rapid gas consumption that prevented to reproduce the amount of gas currently observed in the disk , the unlikelihood of a complete collapse of the whole protogalactic halo in a few 10@xmath2 yr , and the existence of very few metal poor , long living stars in the solar neighbourhood , compared to the relatively large predicted percentage ( the so called g - dwarf problem ) . since then",
    ", gas accretion has turned out to be necessary to explain most of the characteristics of our disk , and all the chemical evolution models ( with or without dynamics ) in better agreement with the largest set of observational constraints assume a significant amount of gas infall throughout the disk lifetime .",
    "one of the most evident effects of gas infall on galactic evolution concerns the absolute value and the radial distribution of the element abundances .",
    "if no gas accretion is assumed after the disk formation , all chemical evolution models with reasonable sfr and initial mass function ( imf ) predict too large present abundances and/or inconsistent radial distributions .",
    "this problem is apparent in the top panel of fig.1 where the distribution of the current oxygen abundances predicted by models with exponentially decreasing sfr and tinsley s ( 1980 ) imf is compared with that derived by peimbert ( 1979 ) and shaver ( 1983 ) from hii regions observations .",
    "the models divide the disk in concentric rings , 1 kpc wide , and assume the sun at 8 kpc .",
    "gas motion can be allowed between consecutive rings , whereas stars are assumed to die in the same region where they were born . if the galactocentric distances of the hii regions are properly rescaled assuming the sun at r=8 kpc , the observational oxygen gradient is @xmath3log(o / h)/@xmath3r = -0.103 dex kpc@xmath4 .",
    "the long - dashed line corresponds to a model with no infall after the disk formation 13 gyr ago : it is too flat and lies above the observed range of oxygen abundances .",
    "the solid line , instead , fits very well the data and corresponds to a model with sfr e - folding time of 15 gyr and constant infall of primordial gas with density rate f = 4 10@xmath5 m@xmath1kpc@xmath6yr@xmath4 all over the disk .",
    "this uniform density rate implies a larger mass of metal free gas infalling in the outer than in the inner rings and favours the development of negative metallicity gradients as steep as observed .",
    "this model reproduces the most important features of the milky way and from now on it will be referred to as the _ reference _ model .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that other combinations of the sfr and infall parameters may lead to a similarly good agreement with the data , as shown in fig.1 by the short - dashed line , corresponding to a model assuming a shorter e - folding time for the sfr ( 5 gyr ) and a lower infall density rate ( f = 2 10@xmath5 m@xmath1kpc@xmath6yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "what is generally found is that models in better agreement with the observational constraints assume sfr e - folding times in the range 5 - 15 gyr and e - folding times for the gas accretion rate longer than for the sfr .",
    "this requirement is not unrealistic , if we consider that according to sofue s ( 1994 ) models the magellanic stream is regularly supplying the milky way with gas since 10 gyr .    if the mass of infalling gas is assumed to increase inwards rather than outwards the model predictions are much less satisfactory .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to a model with infall rate proportional to the total mass of each ring , which is then increasing toward the center . as a consequence",
    ", there is a larger dilution of the inner interstellar medium ( ism ) resulting in a flat abundance distribution inconsistent with that derived from hii regions .",
    "the above results refer to infalling gas with primordial chemical composition , which would be available at best in the intergalactic medium or in the early halo .",
    "if the gas originates from regions already polluted by stellar nucleosynthesis , such as the current halo or the magellanic stream , it has most probably a non negligible metal content .",
    "the intermediate solid line in the bottom panel of fig.1 shows that if the metallicity of the infalling gas is 0.5 z@xmath1 the predictions of the _ reference _ model are at the upper edge of the observed distribution .",
    "the top solid line shows that if the infall metallicity is solar the resulting oxygen abundance is definitely outside the observational range . from a large variety of models ,",
    "tosi ( 1988b ) has found that to allow for a good agreement with the data the infall metallicity should not exceed 0.3 z@xmath1 .",
    "the same result has been obtained by mf with different models and different assumptions on the relative abundances of the infalling elements .",
    "this limit is perfectly consistent with the metal content attributable to both the galactic halo and the magellanic clouds .",
    "depending on the model parameters , the present infall rate for the whole disk ranges between 0.3 and 1.8 m@xmath1yr@xmath4 .",
    "the lower limit of this range is in agreement with the amount inferred from very high velocity clouds which , with the magellanic stream , are the most reliable observational evidence for this phenomenon .",
    "if a fraction of high velocity clouds could be considered of non disk origin as well ( see danly , this volume ) , the amount of infalling gas observationally detected would cover all the theoretical range .",
    "the metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models depend on the ratio between the sfr and the interstellar and infall gas predicted at each epoch and at each galactocentric distance .",
    "the top panel of fig.2 shows the radial distribution of the sfr and infall rate resulting from the _ reference _ model at three different epochs : the dotted line corresponds to the epoch of disk formation ( assumed to be 13 gyr ago ) , the dashed line to the epoch of sun formation ( 8.5 gyr later ) , and the solid line to the present .",
    "since the infall rate is assumed to be constant , only one line appears in the figure .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.2 displays the radial distributions of the gas and total mass at the same three epochs .",
    "the disk is supposed to evolve from an initial configuration of pure gas with radially decreasing mass ( dotted line ) .",
    "the initial sfr is radially decreasing as well , so that in inner regions there is more astration and therefore larger stellar production of metals .",
    "however , the amount of ism gas which must be polluted by these metals is much larger in the inner regions and therefore the efficiency of the ism enrichment is quite modest .",
    "thus , at early epochs the predicted abundance gradients are either flat or even positive , depending on the model parameters ( see also moll 1990 ) .",
    "after several gyr , the situation changes significantly , because the larger astration of the inner regions leads to a higher gas consumption which is not totally compensated by infall since the gas accretion is assumed to be increasing outwards .",
    "thus , at a certain time ( see for instance the dashed line corresponding to the situation 4.5 gyr ago ) the larger sfr in the inner regions corresponds to a higher efficiency in the metal enrichment of the medium and negative abundance gradients start to develop . since then , and as long as the star formation activity remains a decreasing function of the galactocentric distance , the slope of the gradients keeps steepening , because the gas radial distribution becomes increasingly flat , the infall dilution is more efficient outside , and the metal enrichment inside .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the disk of the galaxy is currently in this phase with a very flat radial distribution of the gas mass , a radially decreasing sfr and a sfr / infall rate ratio progressively smaller for increasing r and equal to 1 at 9 - 10 kpc ( see also wilson & matteucci 1992 ) .",
    "a steepening with time of the abundance gradients is predicted by most of the models ( with or without dynamics ) which are able to reproduce the observational features of the galaxy ( e.g. mf , chamcham & tayler 1994 , koppen 1994 ) despite the rather different model characteristics ( see , however , ferrini 1994 for different predictions ) .",
    "it is then important to verify if this predicted trend is indeed consistent with the available observational constraints .",
    "since the gradient derived from data on hii regions is representative of the situation in the current ism , to test the model predictions older objects must be examined as well .",
    "planetary nebulae , specially of peimbert s ( peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ) type ii ( pneii ) , are also very good indicators of the ism metallicity .",
    "pneii have stellar progenitors with lifetimes in the range 1 - 5 gyr and therefore represent the ism conditions around 3 gyr ago .",
    "two recent and extensive studies ( pasquali & perinotto 1993 , hereinafter pp , and maciel & koppen 1994 ) show that the abundance gradients derived for several elements in pneii are systematically flatter than the corresponding gradients derived from hii regions . for instance",
    ", the oxygen gradient derived by pp is @xmath3log(o / h)/@xmath3r = -0.03@xmath70.01 dex kpc@xmath4 and that derived by maciel & koppen is -0.07@xmath70.01 .",
    "the latter authors have also found hints of increasing slopes of the gradients with decreasing age of the pne ( i.e. from type iii to type i ) , in agreement with the model predictions .",
    "fig.3 shows the helium ( bottom ) and oxygen ( top ) abundances as derived by pp from pneii and the corresponding predictions of the _ reference _ model .",
    "the agreement between the model solid line and the empirical best fit to the data ( dotted line ) is excellent .",
    "this confirms that in the last few billion years the slope of the abundance gradients in the ism has actually steepened .",
    "no other gaseous indicators are available to check whether the gradients were increasingly flatter at earlier epochs .",
    "stars and stellar clusters of whatever age are instead visible in a fairly large range of distances and can therefore indicate what was the earlier scenario .      as far as single stars are concerned , the situation is unfortunately rather confuse .",
    "lewis & freeman ( 1989 ) found no significant metallicity gradient in a sample of 600 old k - giants , but more recently edvardsson ( 1993 ) have argued that the radial metallicity distribution derived from a sample of 189 f and g - dwarfs is similar to that derived from hii regions .",
    "the major result of this accurate and extensive work is the scatter on the derived abundances which turns out to be much larger than the observational uncertainties and should then be considered an intrinsic feature of the analysed stellar population .",
    "edvardsson therefore avoided to formally derive the slopes of the abundance gradients , but one can obtain them from their table 14 where the analysed stars are divided in different groups according to their age and galactocentric distance and the average [ fe / h ] of each group is given . despite the poorness of the sample in the older and more distant bins , and the corresponding weakness of the statistics , it is interesting to point out that the resulting formal slopes get flatter for increasing age ( i.e. toward earlier epochs ) and that the oldest bin even shows a positive gradient ( derived from two single points , however ! ) , thus giving some further support to the predictions of the chemical evolution models .",
    "another interesting feature of the edvardsson data is the different distribution of metallicity with age for stars at different galactic locations .",
    "as pointed out by pagel ( 1994 ) and shown in fig.4 , if one divides their stars into three groups according to their mean galactocentric distances ( inner objects , solar ring objects , and outer ones ) , one finds that the outer stars show a much flatter age - metallicity distribution , with average abundances in the last ten billion years ( i.e. over most of the disk lifetime ) systematically lower that those of the other objects .",
    "as already mentioned above , the data show a large intrinsic scatter in the derived metallicities of stars of any age and this scatter can not be directly reproduced by standard chemical evolution models like the _ reference _ one which assumes both the sfr and the gas accretion in a sort of steady - state",
    ". however , the age - metallicity relations predicted for the three ranges of galactocentric distances are consistent with each of the corresponding average empirical distributions .",
    "notice that the relations predicted for the solar ( solid line ) and the outer ( dotted line ) rings flatten off at recent epochs , whereas the relation predicted for the inner ring ( dashed line ) keeps increasing up to the present time , as already shown by mf .",
    "besides , franois & matteucci ( 1993 ) have argued that even the spread of the observed age - metallicity distribution can be accounted for by _ standard _ models , once the different birthplaces of the sample stars are considered .",
    "the major problem of single stars analyses is the uncertainty in the derived r , age and metallicity of objects beyond a limited distance from the sun as confirmed by the edvardsson s survey . from this point of view ,",
    "open clusters are in principle safer indicators .",
    "there are , however , several problems affecting also the determination of the cluster parameters , such as the non homogeneity of most age estimates and the uncertainty on the cluster original birthplace , the cluster disruption due to disk friction which can alter the original distributions , etc .",
    "( see , however , carraro & chiosi 1994 ) .",
    "several years ago , young open clusters have been suggested to indicate steeper abundance gradients than old open clusters ( mayor 1976 , panagia & tosi 1981 ) .",
    "however , more recent and extensive studies ( friel & janes 1993 , thogersen 1993 ) do not seem to support this hypothesis .",
    "the metallicity gradient derived by janes and collaborators is @xmath3[fe / h]/@xmath3r = -0.09@xmath70.02 dex kpc@xmath4 for the whole sample of clusters of any age , and does not seem to depend on the cluster age .",
    "bearing in mind that for field stars in the disk oxygen has been empirically found to follow the relation [ o / fe]@xmath80.3[fe / h ] ( e.g. edvardsson 1993 ) , and assuming that this relation applies to open clusters as well , the iron gradient corresponds to an oxygen gradient @xmath3log(o / h)/@xmath3r = -0.06 , flatter indeed than that derived from hii regions and more similar to that of objects ( as the pneii discussed above ) a few gyr old .",
    "the most striking feature of friel & janes sample is that at each galactic radius the oldest clusters are also the most metal rich ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "it is true that the published clusters in the oldest age bin ( @xmath98 gyr ) are only four and the corresponding statistics is therefore too poor ; however two additional clusters of roughly the same age have been found ( friel 1994 , private communication ) with less extreme metal abundances but still higher than average .",
    "it is of crucial importance to verify this result with a larger sample of old clusters and with more accurate and homogeneous methods to derive their ages , chemical abundances and galactic original locations .",
    "it might well be , in fact , that this anomaly is fictitious and resulting from the uncertainty in the metallicity and/or , more probably , age determination .",
    "however , if confirmed , this phenomenon would have remarkable implications on our understanding of the galaxy evolution , because it is opposite to any intuitive age - metallicity relation derivable from _ steady - state _ scenarios where old stars are inevitably more metal poor than young objects and may result from short , intense phenomena not considered in our models .",
    "another characteristics of old open clusters is that all of them are located beyond 7 - 7.5 kpc from the galactic center , contrary to younger clusters which are likely to be equally distributed everywhere in the disk ( janes & phelps 1994 ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the external location of the older clusters in the observed sample might not reflect an odd distribution of all the clusters formed several gyr ago and be the result of a more efficient disruption in the inner than in the outer regions . on the other hand",
    ", it may instead correspond to a non homogeneous star formation activity , perhaps related to external phenomena like the first impact on the disk of the magellanic stream ( sofue 1994 ) .",
    "the latter scenario might also provide an explanation to the large metallicity of the oldest clusters , in terms of a transitory metal enhancement of the ism due to the larger sfr triggered by the sudden event and later smeared out during the following _ steady - state _ evolution .",
    "in conclusion , the comparison between the abundance distributions in the galactic disk predicted by _ standard _ chemical evolution models and derived from observational data can be summarized as follows : + a ) abundance distributions derived from observations of gaseous objects of various ages ( hii regions and pne ) are very well reproduced by _ steady - state _ models with slowly decreasing sfr and large - long lasting infall of metal poor gas .",
    "+ b ) average abundance distributions derived from stars are also reproduced .",
    "these _ standard _ models , however , do not reproduce the observed spread in the metallicity distribution of field stars and the anomalously high [ fe / h ] of the oldest open clusters .",
    "we must bear in mind , however , that old stars can have quite eccentric orbits and can therefore have formed in galactic regions different from those where they are observed now . according to franois & matteucci this might explain most of the abundance spread in the edvardsson s sample . on the other hand , carraro & chiosi ( 1994 ) have suggested that the same argument can not apply to the case of old open clusters , for which other explanations are thus needed , unless all the inconsistencies with the model predictions can be attributed to observational errors .",
    "a possible reason for the different agreement found for gas and stellar objects is that the gas mixes rapidly , compared to the timescales for galactic evolution , therefore forgets local perturbations occurred in the past and follows the _ steady - state _ scenario .",
    "stars , instead , keep memory of the local perturbations occurring at , or just before , their birth and therefore deviate more from that scenario , showing intrinsic large scatter and anomalous behaviours . to interpret in detail their observed features more sophisticated models taking into account also the small scale , short term phenomena are therefore required .",

    "* tosi*. outflows havent been introduced yet in _ standard _ chemical evolution models , because we do nt have enough observational constraints on their chemical composition , on the significance of the phenomenon or on the final fate of the ejected gas ( does it eventually escape from the system or falls back , and where ? ) . in absence of such information",
    ", too many free parameters should be assumed in the models to allow for a safe interpretation of the results .",
    "* tosi*. if the ejected gas is lost for ever , it should lead to a reduction of the inner abundances and therefore to a flattening of the radial gradient of the outflowing chemical elements .",
    "if the wind is made only of the gas ejected by sne , the effect will be restricted to the elements , like oxygen , synthesized by their progenitors , otherwise it will be on all the metals .",
    "* tosi*. the infalling gas has presumably a composite origin : at early epochs it must have been mostly collapsing halo material , with a small component of extragalactic gas ; nowadays it is most probably due to external gas .",

    "* andersen*. i am still somewhat concerned about the amount and age of data on which some crucial features of the models depend rather critically .",
