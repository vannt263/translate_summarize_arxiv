    "gravitational radiation was first predicted by einstein@xcite as a consequence of his general theory of relativity .",
    "gravitational waves ( gw ) are the propagation of a wave of space - time curvature , and are generated by perturbations in massive systems .",
    "the lowest multipole of this type of radiation is the quadrupole . even though astrophysical events are expected to emit massive energy fluxes in the form of gravitational radiation , they are yet to be directly detected",
    "this is because gravity waves interact very weakly with matter .",
    "however , for many decades experimentalists have been pushing the limits of technology .",
    "currently the free - mass laser interferometer detectors have been improved to a point , where they are expected to directly detect gravitational waves in the 0.1 to 1 khz frequency band through the development of advanced ligo@xcite .",
    "the first gravitational wave detectors were based on the `` weber bar '' , and required the monitoring of a high-@xmath6 massive resonant system ( resonant - mass detector ) .",
    "such a system will change its state of vibration due to an incident gravitational wave of matched frequency and rely on ultra - sensitive transducers to readout the vibration .",
    "these transducers detect the displacement change of the system and convert it to an electronic signal .",
    "since the first detector was built@xcite technology improved rapidly over the years , with major projects in italy , usa and australia@xcite .",
    "these detectors necessarily operated at low temperatures , and were successfully built at high sensitivity operating at 5 k down to 100 mk .",
    "the original transducers that weber used were based on piezoelectricity , and later gap modulated displacement sensors were developed based on squid readouts@xcite and low noise parametric systems@xcite .",
    "these devices were optimised to detect millisecond bursts , typically produced by supernovas with strain sensitivities of order @xmath7 ( or signal strain fourier component @xmath8 strain / hz ) , but have generally been superseded by the laser interferometer detectors@xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim to revive the resonant - mass detector for the first cosmic search of high frequency gravitational wave radiation based on piezoelectric quartz bulk acoustic wave ( baw ) resonators . despite dominance of the low frequency gw detection ,",
    "this technology opens the way to test for known and unknown high frequency sources@xcite .",
    "in general high frequency gravitational waves are thought to exist over a broad range of frequencies up to @xmath9  hz , but at a reduced amplitude compared to low frequency sources sensitive to ligo .",
    "such experiments could be interesting from two points of view : first , the high frequency region has physically understood processes of generation of gws , second , such experiments can be regarded as tests for many emerging theories predicting gw radiation at such frequencies .",
    "the former mostly includes phenomena associated with discrete sources such as thermal gravitational radiation from stars@xcite , radiation from low mass primordial black holes@xcite , gravitational modes of plasma flows@xcite , while the latter group is built up by cosmological sources including stochastic sources in the early universe@xcite , gw background from quintessential inflation@xcite , cosmic strings@xcite , dilation@xcite , pre - big bang scenarios@xcite , superinflation in loop quantum gravity@xcite , post inflationary phase transitions@xcite , parametric resonance at the end of inflation or preheating@xcite and other predicted objects like brane - world black holes associated with extra dimensions@xcite or clouds of axions@xcite .",
    "at least one of the hypothetical sources ( due to the galactic centre shadow brane ) comes within a factor 5 of the sensitivity of the single detector proposed in this work @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the detector could be further improved via a variety of techniques to bridge this factor of 5 .",
    "for example , the detector proposed in this work can be operated in the quantum limit , thus standard techniques to beat the quantum limit for the detection of a classical force can be used . other ways to increase the sensitivity would be to use a larger resonant - mass structure , or an array of detectors .",
    "thus , this technique will provide a valuable upper bound on such gw sources in the mhz frequency band and also provide an avenue for possible detection .    the technological advancement which allows",
    "this possibility is due to recent work on quartz bulk acoustic wave ( baw ) resonators , which have been cooled to below 20 mk with outstanding acoustic properties@xcite .",
    "also , they have proven to be compatible with squid amplifiers and offer quantum limited amplification at mk temperatures@xcite .",
    "the modes in these devices are naturally sensitive to gravitational waves at very high frequencies between 1 mhz to nearly 1 ghz with @xmath6-factors of order @xmath10 and approaching @xmath9 .",
    "the piezoelectricity and high acoustic @xmath6-factor ensures significant `` self '' transductance of the baw resonator with high electromechanical sensitivity without the necessity of an externally added transducer .",
    "these devices were originally developed for high stability frequency applications@xcite and more recently adapted at low temperatures for quantum information applications@xcite and fundamental physics tests@xcite .",
    "indeed it seems like the quantum limited read out of these devices in the quantum ground state will soon be achieved .",
    "temperatures are accessible where such modes will be in their ground state without the necessity of sideband cooling and near quantum limited squid and parametric amplifiers also exist at these frequencies@xcite . here , we show that a sensitive gravitational wave detector of @xmath11 strain per @xmath3 can be realised with the present day technology in the frequency range of 1 to 1000 mhz .",
    "currently there is no other technology capable of measuring such high frequency gravitational waves with such sensitivity , and a range of possible high frequency sources could exist .",
    "only recently an idea of detecting medium frequency gw ( @xmath12 khz ) using levitating optical resonators has been proposed@xcite .",
    "in addition to that searches for gw background at @xmath13mhz have been considered with an interferometric detector@xcite .",
    "the system proposed in this work can potentially provide a larger frequency range and higher sensitivity for this purpose .",

    "although manufacturing of such device is associated with considerable technological difficulties , the existence of it is very beneficial for standard keeping applications allowing not only more accurate mass standard but also signal transferring due to mass lock to frequency .",
    "this 1-kg standard will have a significantly lower frequency around @xmath13 khz range , but augmented active mass a least @xmath168 times that is beneficial for the sensitivity . in the same time , quality factor of such device at cryogenic temperature can not be reliably predicted , although it is generally observed that larger mass systems exhibit higher values of the @xmath6-factor@xcite .",

    "<S> there are a number of theoretical predictions for astrophysical and cosmological objects , which emit high frequency ( @xmath0  hz ) gravitation waves ( gw ) or contribute somehow to the stochastic high frequency gw background . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new sensitive detector in this frequency band , which is based on existing cryogenic ultra - high quality factor quartz bulk acoustic wave cavity technology , coupled to near - quantum - limited squid amplifiers at @xmath1  mk . </S>",
    "<S> we show that spectral strain sensitivities reaching @xmath2 per @xmath3 per mode is possible , which in principle can cover the frequency range with multiple ( @xmath4 ) modes with quality factors varying between @xmath5 allowing wide bandwidth detection . due to its compactness and well established manufacturing process , </S>",
    "<S> the system is easily scalable into arrays and distributed networks that can also impact the overall sensitivity and introduce coincidence analysis to ensure no false detections . </S>"
