    "current fluctuations represent a fundamental characteristic feature of quantum transport in systems away from equilibrium .",
    "these fluctuations generate noise , which besides spoiling the signal propagation , provides @xcite-@xcite the experimental basis of noise spectroscopy .",

    "the landauer - bttiker approach goes much beyond the linear response approximation and is the core of modern quantum transport theory .",
    "it has been successfully generalised @xcite-@xcite and applied to the computation of the noise power @xcite-@xcite and the full counting statistics @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address a subtle question in the landauer - bttiker ( lb ) scheme , namely the impact of bound states on the current fluctuations . to be more precise , we consider the multi - terminal system shown in fig .",
    "each semi - infinite lead @xmath4 is attached at infinity to a heat reservoir @xmath3 with ( inverse ) temperature @xmath5 and chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "the interaction between the leads is localised at their junction and is described by a unitary scattering matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the system is away from equilibrium if there are leads which communicate via non - vanishing transmission elements of @xmath7 .",
    "our goal will be to analyse the quantum transport in the case when the analytic structure of @xmath7 implies the existence of bound states with energies @xmath1 . in synthesis",
    ", we will show that the current fluctuations at frequency @xmath0 are affected by all bound states with energies @xmath2 .",
    "we will derive in closed and explicit form both the scattering and bound state contributions @xmath8 and @xmath9 to the noise power of the system in the lb non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the comparison between @xmath8 and @xmath9 reveals the essential role of bound states .",
    "we adopt the field theory framework of @xcite-@xcite , which allows for a systematic account of all bound states .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe in detail the system we are dealing with , focussing on the bound state contribution to the spectrum . in section 3 we compute the connected two - point current correlation function and extract the noise powers @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the general result and illustrate the behavior of the noise power for some values of the parameters characterising the system .",
    "section 5 collects our conclusions .",
    "we consider systems where both the particle number and the total energy are conserved .",
    "the particle number conservation implies that the total scattering matrix @xmath7 is a direct sum of the @xmath10-body matrices @xmath11 .",
    "since the treatment of bound states is notoriously a hard task , we focus in what follows on the simplest non - trivial case .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath12 for @xmath13 and keep non - trivial only the one - body scattering matrix @xmath14 , which describes the interaction in the junction .",
    "this assumption is justified by recalling that the idea of freely propagating fermions along the leads accounts remarkably well @xcite for the experimental results @xcite .",
    "one possible realisation of this scenario is the schrdinger junction with a point - like defect .",
    "our previous analysis @xcite-@xcite shows that this system represents a remarkable laboratory for testing general ideas about quantum transport .",
    "the study of the bound state problem below confirms once again this statement .",

    "since ( [ ccr1 ] ) reflects the completeness of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , it is essential in what follows for fixing the bound state contribution to field @xmath19 .",
    "the junction plays physically the role of a point - like defect .",
    "the associated interaction determines the one - body scattering matrix @xmath7 , which is fixed by requiring that the bulk hamiltonian @xmath20 admits a self - adjoint extension in @xmath21 .",
    "all such extensions are defined @xcite-@xcite by the boundary condition @xmath22 \\psi ( t , x , j ) = 0\\ , ,   \\label{bc1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the identity matrix , @xmath24 is a generic @xmath25 unitary matrix and @xmath26 is a parameter with dimension of mass .",

    "it is easily seen that @xmath29 is a meromorphic function with poles located on the imaginary axis and different from 0 .",
    "in fact , let @xmath30 be the unitary matrix diagonalising @xmath24 , namely @xmath31 with @xmath32",

    "the second term in the right hand side of ( [ ccrs ] ) does not vanish , which reflects the fact that the scattering states ( [ ss ] ) are incomplete .",
    "using the cauchy s integral formula and the representation ( [ d3 ] ) , one finds @xmath50 in order to compensate ( [ cbs ] ) and satisfy the canonical anti - commutator ( [ ccr1 ] ) , we must add new degrees of freedom describing the bound states . for this purpose",

    "the above construction is fully determined by the completeness of the hamiltonian eigenstates and , as shown below , allows to evaluate in a systematic way the bound state contribution to the particle current and the noise power .",

    "then the noise power at frequency @xmath0 in @xmath4 is defined @xcite by the fourier transform @xmath71 in order to simplify the analysis of @xmath72 , it is instructive to represent it in the form @xmath73 where @xmath8 collects the pure scattering contribution and @xmath9 vanishes in absence of bound states .",
    "we concentrate first on scattering component , which represents the finite - frequency generalisation of the result of martin , landauer @xcite and bttiker @xcite .",

    "@xmath79 the limit ( [ nps3 ] ) is in addition @xmath80-independent due to the kirchhoff rule . ] and provides a useful check , reproducing the zero - frequency noise power derived in @xcite-@xcite , namely @xmath81   \\tau^2(\\omega ) \\nonumber \\\\ + [ d_1(\\omega ) + d_2(\\omega ) -2d_1(\\omega)d_2(\\omega ) ] \\tau(\\omega)[1-\\tau(\\omega)]\\bigr \\}\\ , , \\label{nps4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the transmission probability .",
    "the @xmath83-integration in ( [ nps1],[nps4 ] ) can not be performed explicitly for generic values of the heat reservoir parameters .",
    "however the integrands have no singularities around @xmath84 . ] in the integration domain and the numerical computation is straightforward .",
    "the examples in section 4 illustrate this fact .",
    "we turn now to the bound state contribution . using the explicit form ( [ psib ] ) of @xmath63 , after some algebra one gets @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the heaviside step function at the discontinuity point . ] and @xmath87 using ( [ ss ] ) and introducing the combination @xmath88 one gets @xmath89    eq . ( [ npb4 ] ) gives in exact and explicit form the bound state contribution @xmath9 to the noise power in the lb non - equilibrium steady state and represents our main result .",
    "let us briefly describe the key features of ( [ npb4 ] ) .",
    "we observe first of all that @xmath90 is a nonnegative oscillating function of @xmath0 and @xmath78 , which vanishes in the limits @xmath91 and @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 implying that the bound states do not affect the zero - frequency noise .",
    "therefore , for detecting a bound state @xmath93 one needs frequencies @xmath94 .",
    "notice also that the potential discontinuity in ( [ npb4 ] ) , due to the heaviside function , is absent because @xmath95 around @xmath96 .    in the shot noise regime",
    "@xmath97 one finds @xmath98 therefore the bound state @xmath93 contributes to the shot noise for chemical potentials @xmath99 .",
    "let us clarify finally the role of the factor @xmath100 in ( [ npb4 ] ) . from the unitarity constraint @xmath101 one",
    "infers that @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath100 can be interpreted as a weight factor , which measures the contribution of the bound state @xmath93 to the particle current in the lead @xmath4 for different choices of the matrix @xmath24 in the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the following two limiting cases . for generic @xmath24 one",
    "has @xmath103 for all @xmath93 , implying that all bound states contribute to the current in @xmath4 . for diagonal @xmath24",
    "one has instead @xmath104 , showing that only the bound state @xmath56 , if it exists , contributes to the current in the lead @xmath4 .    to summarise , we derived the bound state contribution to the noise power of the schrdinger junction , showing that the frequency @xmath0 is the appropriate control parameter for bound state spectroscopy .",
    "in fact , by increasing the value of @xmath0 one can identify one after the other all bound states of the system .",
    "we will illustrate this remarkable feature by some examples in the next section .",
    "we describe now the impact of bound states on the noise power . from the unitarity of @xmath7 one",
    "infers that @xmath105 inserting ( [ com1 ] ) in ( [ npb4 ] ) an using the unitarity of @xmath30 one finds the upper bound @xmath106 the estimate ( [ com2 ] ) holds for any lead @xmath4 and shows that the effect of the bound states decays exponentially with the distance from the junction .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the form of the bound state wave functions manifest in ( [ psib ] ) .",
    "it turns out that close to the junction the bound state noise power @xmath9 can dominate the scattering contribution @xmath8 . in order to illustrate this feature we consider the two - lead junction ( @xmath79 ) . in this case",
    "the most general scattering matrix is generated by substituting @xmath107 in ( [ d3 ] ) and has the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath86 are arbitrary angles .",
    "we assume for illustration that two bound states @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( in units of mass @xmath10 ) are present and take @xmath112 and @xmath113 . finally ,",

    "we observe first that the bound state contribution is essential and dominating in certain frequency ranges .",
    "second , there are discontinuities in the @xmath0-derivative of @xmath9 at @xmath119 , which clearly mark the bound states and are followed by characteristic resonant - like peaks .",
    "as already mentioned , this behavior represents an attractive tool for bound state spectroscopy . in a finite - frequency experimental setup @xcite one",
