    "for decades , type ia supernovae ( sn  ia ) have been interpreted as thermonuclear explosions that result from either accretion onto a degenerate white dwarf or via coalescence of two degenerate stars ; see @xcite for a thorough review .",
    "models that begin fusion subsonically and then turn into a detonation are best at matching observations of typical sn  ia @xcite .",
    "synthesized intermediate - mass elements ( imes ) like silicon and sulfur in sn  ia spectra are the result of c and o burning at low densities due to the pre - expansion of the white dwarf during the deflagration phase .",
    "the deflagration turns into a detonation , and the combination of the two produces a significant amount of @xmath4ni , the decay of which powers the light curve .",
    "sn  ia show a range of energies and spectral characteristics , but the majority of them are quite homogeneous when compared with other supernova types .",
    "the relative uniformity amongst sn  ia explosions has allowed their exploitation as cosmic standard candles , and observed correlations between light - curve shape , peak luminosity @xcite , and color @xcite have enabled the precise measurement of cosmologically interesting distances .",
    "it is with these measurements , taken over a range of redshifts , that estimates of the hubble parameter ( @xmath5 ) and cosmic matter density have been refined @xcite , and evidence for dark energy was revealed @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey - ii ( sdss - ii ) supernova survey was designed to further improve sn  ia as distance indicators @xcite . covering a 300 deg@xmath6 area with a rapid cadence , the survey discovered and spectroscopically confirmed roughly 500 sn  ia over a range of redshifts out to @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used the first year of sdss - ii data to constrain the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 , and analyzed the systematic errors limiting the cosmological measurements .    identifying the progenitors of sn  ia and better understanding",

    "* ) events were quickly recognized as being peculiar , although much of the spectroscopic diversity is now known to be caused by a range of photospheric temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , additional subclasses of sn  ia have been identified .",
    "for example , sn  2002ic @xcite and sn  2005gj @xcite are luminous objects that show hydrogen emission lines in their spectra , unlike normal sn  ia .",
    "it is suspected they may be sn  ia interacting with dense circumstellar material , although a core - collapse scenario has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "sn  2002cx ( hereafter 02cx ) was especially peculiar @xcite .",
    "it showed a hot ( 91t - like ) spectrum at early times , but it cooled quickly after maximum brightness and its expansion velocities were well below typical for a sn  ia .",
    "02cx deviated significantly from the @xcite relation between peak luminosity and decline rate ; it was subluminous for its light - curve shape by @xmath9 mag in the @xmath1 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "the well - observed sn  2005hk ( hereafter 05hk ) was spectroscopically very similar to 02cx  both exhibited photospheric velocities of roughly 7000  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "photometrically , 05hk was faint on the phillips relation by @xmath111.0 mag in the optical , but @xmath12 mag more luminous than 02cx @xcite .",
    "@xcite have identified several other 02cx - like objects and postulated that their extreme subluminosity suggests that they constitute a class of pure thermonuclear deflagrations : that is , the fusion front moving through the white dwarf fails to make the transition to supersonic burning @xcite and is unable to generate the large amounts of radioactive nickel observed in typical sn  ia @xcite .",
    "the thermonuclear burning of carbon and oxygen at moderate densities will create imes such as silicon , sulfur , and calcium that dominate the spectrum .",
    "though typical sn  ia experience this phase only briefly , @xcite reasoned that 02cx - like objects may burn completely via this mechanism .",

    "which characteristics separate delayed detonations from pure deflagrations",
    "? simulations of pure deflagration events predict that rayleigh - taylor instabilities will form clumps of radioactive nickel and mix unburned material toward the center @xcite .",
    "late - time spectra of 02cx - like events show many permitted iron transitions broken up into thin spikes @xcite , indicative of the lower velocities that characterize 02cx - like supernovae .",
    "these spectra also show narrow forbidden lines of ca  ii and fe  ii , but are quite distinct from normal sn  ia at late epochs , whose spectra are dominated by relatively broad , blended fe  ii and fe  iii lines .",
    "spectra of 05hk @xmath13 200 days past maximum have been analyzed for emission from unburned c  i and o  i , but their existence has not been confirmed @xcite .    an extremely subluminous transient , sn  2008 ha ( hereafter 08 ha ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , appears to be an additional member of the 02cx class , although @xcite have proposed that the extreme nature of 08 ha ( and other 02cx - like objects ) is better matched by the core collapse of a massive star where most of the synthesized radioactive elements fall back to a black hole . with the discovery of si  ii and s  ii in the early - time spectra of 08 ha @xcite , that proposition becomes less likely .    here , we report photometry and spectroscopy of sn  2007qd ( hereafter 07qd ) . its observed properties place it in the 02cx subclass of supernovae , specifically as a member intermediate to 02cx and 08 ha , linking these objects .",
    "we present the photometric and spectroscopic observations of 07qd and compare its unique properties with a range of other sn .",
    "we estimate the rise time , luminosity distance , and peak luminosity of this peculiar object , and we calculate its kinetic energy .",
    "furthermore , we model the spectra to determine the velocity and composition of the ejecta and compare these with the findings of other similar sn to identify common traits . with this information",
    "we predict the synthesized @xmath4ni mass and determine whether 07qd shares more in common with a thermonuclear deflagration or a core - collapse scenario .",
    "07qd @xcite was discovered during the sdss - ii supernova survey using the sdss camera on the 2.5  m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory .",
    "the sn was located amidst a spiral arm at @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( j2000.0 ) , a projected distance of 10.6 kpc from the nucleus of the sbb / sbc host galaxy sdss j020932.73 - 005959.8 centered at @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "the foreground milky way extinction in the direction of 07qd is @xmath19 mag as calculated from the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "the photometry was calibrated in the standard sdss @xmath20 photometric system @xcite .",
    "the flux from the supernova was estimated by using the scene modeling technique @xcite from individual calibrated images and without spatial resampling .",
    "figure  [ f : lightcurves2 ] shows the sdss - ii light curves in the @xmath20 bands ; the data are listed in table  [ t : phot_data ] .",
    "the time of peak bolometric flux for 07qd is not well defined , but probably occurred within a span of 2 days around maximum apparent @xmath21-band magnitude @xmath22 mag on mjd 54405.39 .",
    "we base this on both the available @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath24 data detected on that date , and the fact that the @xmath23 and @xmath21 fluxes were falling while the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 fluxes were still rising .",
    "@xcite noted that the spectrum of 07qd was similar to that of 05hk , so we compared their light curves . while the maximum @xmath21-band apparent magnitude of 05hk was @xmath27 , it achieved a peak @xmath1-band absolute magnitude of @xmath28 .",
    "this is rather dim for a typical sn  ia ( @xmath29 mag ) , but @xmath30 mag brighter than 07qd ( see   3.1 ) .",
    "featured in figure  [ f : lightcurves2 ] are the 05hk light curves corrected to the observed frame of 07qd .",
    "in addition , the brightness of 05hk has been reduced by 2.4 mag to better match the peak flux of 07qd and enable their shapes to be compared . ignoring possible differences in dust extinction",
    ", 05hk is more luminous than 07qd in all of the sdss bands , and 05hk both rose and declined more slowly in @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath24 than 07qd .",
    "the light - curve widths of the two supernovae are similar at near - infrared wavelengths ( sdss @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , though 07qd shows a very slow decline rate at red wavelengths .",
    "05hk also appears to peak later than 07qd as the bandpass becomes progressively redder .",
    "we compared the light curve of 07qd with those of additional supernovae to identify any possibly similarity to the type ic or ii classes .",
    "as 07qd rose rather quickly , we compared it to other events which shared similar rise times .",
    "we chose the fast - evolving sn  1994i @xcite , a well - observed prototype for sn  ic not associated with a gamma - ray burst , and sn  1999gi @xcite , a type iip ( plateau ) sn whose absolute @xmath1 magnitude at peak was similar to that of 07qd ( described in detail in   3.1 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : sn_types ] exhibits the shapes of these light curves in the @xmath24 band .",
    "though the steep rise implied by the 07qd data may be similar to those of a sn  iip or sn  ic , the decline of 07qd and 05hk fails to represent the steep drop of sn  1994i or the extended plateau of sn  1999gi .",
    "in addition , the rise of 07qd is far faster than that of 05hk and is more similar to that of 08 ha @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : colorcomp_gr ] compares the color evolution of 07qd to that of 05hk , and reveals the former to be more blue near maximum brightness .",
    "the colors of normal sn  ia are fairly well established @xcite and are used to estimate the reddening caused by dust in the host galaxy .",
    "however , the intrinsic colors of peculiar 02cx - like events are uncertain , making the estimation of host - galaxy extinction problematic .",
    "07qd is bluer than 05hk , having lower @xmath31 colors of @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 mag at 0.4 and 1.3 days past @xmath1 maximum , respectively .",
    "this suggests that dust extinction is not the major cause of the low luminosity of 07qd compared with 05hk .",
    "additionally , 07qd appears to decline slower in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 light curves .",
    "the 3.58 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) in the canary islands observed 07qd at 3 days after @xmath1 maximum ( see  3.1 for the determination of @xmath34 ) .",

    "the spectra were observed with the low - resolution blue grism ( lr - b , dispersion 2.52    @xmath39 ) , covering the 36737401    range at an airmass of 1.27 .",

    "* ) at 8 and 15 days past maximum .",
    "at the prime focus , the lrs employed a @xmath42 plate scale with a @xmath43 wide by @xmath44 long slit and covered the 40759586    range , though low signal - to - noise ratios severely limit visibility past 8000   .",
    "we obtained low - resolution spectra at 10 days past maximum brightness with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",

    "the keck measurement was able to cover bluer wavelengths than the other observations , spanning the 30738800    range .",
    "for all spectra , standard ccd processing and spectrum extraction were performed with iraf .",
    "the data were extracted using the optimal algorithm of @xcite .",
    "low - order polynomial fits to calibration - lamp spectra were used to establish the wavelength scale , and small adjustments derived from night - sky lines in the object frames were applied .",

    "a journal of the spectroscopic observations is given in table  [ t : spec_sched ] , and the resulting extracted and reduced spectra are detailed in figure [ f : qd_evolve ] .",
    "we infer a rise time of @xmath45 days based on the nondetections in the sdss - ii data , much shorter than that of typical sn  ia @xcite .",
    "we began our analysis by applying the light - curve fitters mlcs2k2 @xcite and salt2 @xcite to the 07qd , 05hk , 02cx , and 08 ha data using the snana platform @xcite .",
    "the resulting fits were of very poor quality , with @xmath46 per degree of freedom , suggesting the inability of these algorithms , trained on normal events , to fit the colors and light - curve shapes of 02cx - like peculiar supernovae .",
    "we decided to take a simple approach and estimate the @xmath1-band light - curve stretch @xcite versus peak brightness for the peculiar events and some more normal sn  ia .",
    "we used snana @xcite to convert from @xmath20 to the standard @xmath47 for sdss - ii sn  ia with @xmath48 , verifying the uncertainty with the conversions of @xcite .",
    "snana applies the mlcs2k2 k - correction algorithm , which is based on a color - matched normal sn  ia spectral energy distribution .",
    "this may introduce small errors due to differences in the spectral features between 07qd and typical sn  ia .    for 07qd",
    "we find a maximum absolute magnitude ( after correcting only for milky way galaxy extinction ) of @xmath49 mag .",
    "we estimate that the time of peak @xmath1 brightness occurred on mjd @xmath50 , though the true value could be smaller due to the lack of data on the rise .",
    "the slopes of the blue light curves of 07qd flatten out rapidly after 10 days .",
    "consequently , @xmath51 mag for 07qd , or roughly the same as that of 05hk @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ f : lightcurves2 ] , 07qd clearly fades more quickly than does 05hk , suggesting that in this case , the measurement of @xmath52 does not compare well with other sn  ia .",
    "based on our estimation of the rise time , figure  [ f : stretch73 ] compares the absolute magnitude of 07qd and its @xmath1-band stretch with those of 02cx , 05hk , 08 ha , and the normal sdss - ii sn  ia ( see @xcite for a list of these sn ) .",
    "the low - redshift set of sdss - ii contains a handful of 91bg - like events with stretch parameters @xmath53 , but 07qd and 08 ha have narrower light curves and are much fainter",
    ". there appears to be a sequence connecting the bright , peculiar events 05hk and 02cx to the extreme 08 ha with the intermediate 07qd in figure  [ f : stretch73 ] .    to examine the bolometric luminosities , a blackbody was fit to the @xmath20 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as measured at @xmath1 maximum brightness .",
    "ultraviolet measurements shortward of @xmath23 were not available for 07qd .",
    "05hk and 08 ha experienced severe photospheric line blanketing at @xmath54    @xcite , which , along with our keck spectrum ( 10 days past maximum ) , suggests that the luminosity of 07qd drops off sharply at that point . using a hubble constant of @xmath55 km @xmath56 @xmath57 @xcite and our measured redshift ,",
    "a luminosity distance of 177  mpc ( @xmath58 mag ) was computed . integrating our sed ( corrected for milky way extinction ) and applying our luminosity distance , we calculated the peak quasi - bolometric luminosity to be @xmath59 ergs @xmath56 .",
    "assuming `` arnett s rule '' @xcite as applied by @xcite , we estimate the synthesized @xmath4ni mass using the ratio of maximum luminosity to the luminosity produced by one solar mass of @xmath4ni ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 days and @xmath62 days are the e - folding times for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . thus , for our maximum possible @xmath65 day rise time , we estimate an upper limit of @xmath66 m@xmath67 , which is nearly a factor of 5 larger than that of 08 ha [ @xmath68 m@xmath67 ; @xcite ] , but still much smaller than that of 05hk [ @xmath69 ; @xcite ] . here , we assume that the efficiency of radioactive energy deposition @xmath70 is unity ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the ejecta mass may be estimated by utilizing the treatments of @xcite and @xcite , assuming an opacity of 0.1 @xmath71 @xmath72 , as per an fe  ii spectrum in the same vein as @xcite .",
    "comparing 07qd to a typical sn  ia of kinetic energy @xmath73 ergs , rise time 17 days @xcite , and photospheric velocity 10,000 km s@xmath3 , we derived an ejecta mass of 0.15  m@xmath74 .",
    "this could be even lower if the rise time of 07qd is under 10 days or using higher estimates of standard sn  ia rise times .",
    "based on a photospheric velocity 3 days past maximum brightness of 2800 km s@xmath3 ( see  3.2.1 ) , this translates to a kinetic energy of @xmath75 ergs .",
    "this is similar to the kinetic - energy estimate of 08 ha by @xcite , but roughly an order of magnitude lower than the @xmath76 ergs of 05hk based on its photospheric velocity @xcite .",
    "typical sn  ia contain @xmath4ni masses between 0.1 and 1.0 m@xmath74 and ejecta masses ranging from 0.5 m@xmath74 for sn  1991bg to the canonical 1.4  m@xmath74 @xcite .",
    "both of these values are significantly larger than our findings for 07qd .",
    "we used synow @xcite , a parameterized supernova spectrum synthesis code , to fit our spectra to profiles of various ions at specific velocities , excitation temperatures , and opacities .",
    "these ions are simulated in an expanding photosphere of a chosen blackbody temperature , and the resulting spectra can be compared with data .",
    "we systematically fit our spectra with ions commonly seen in sn  ia at similar epochs ( fe  ii , co  ii , si  ii ; see @xcite and @xcite for lists of expected ions and isotopic yields ) , and attempted to simulate hydrogen and helium to rule out the possibility of a type ii or ib sn .",
    "the photospheric velocity was fixed at each epoch by the best fit for the fe  ii lines , and subsequent elements were fit either residing in that photosphere or at detached velocities . after confirming the presence or absence of these species",
    ", we tried to fit elements uncommon to normal sn  ia in order to fit any remaining line profiles .",
    "we also attempted to use na  i  d host and interstellar absorption to measure dust extinction though the procedures of @xcite .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra , combined with features at various velocities scattered throughout the continuum , created too much uncertainty in these equivalent widths to fix an extinction value .",
    "figure [ f:3d_decomposed ] and table  [ t : qd_3d ] present the results of our synow fit to the spectrum 3 days after maximum brightness , as well as a decomposition of the fit to show the influence of each ion .",
    "we found from the fe  ii lines a photospheric velocity of 2800  km @xmath77 , which is extraordinarily low .",
    "typical sn  ia photospheric velocities at this epoch are often in excess of 10,000 km @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the low velocities found for most of the regions makes it highly unlikely that the strong feature at 6300    is from hydrogen or helium either in the photosphere or detached .",
    "the best fit to the 6300    absorption was si  ii , since the velocity of fe  ii was constrained when fitting the @xmath78   , @xmath79   , and @xmath80    features as well as others in the bluer spectral regions .",
    "si  ii fit the absorption best when at a velocity of 800 km s@xmath3 lower than that of the iron - group ions .",
    "also prominent in the @xmath81    region is a broad primary o  i line .",
    "the secondary signatures of o  i are weakly detected at @xmath82   , but masked at @xmath80    due to the strong si  ii feature nearby .",
    "si  iii and c  iii were implemented in a manner similar to that used by @xcite to help co  ii shape the area around @xmath83   .",
    "c  ii , also present in the maximum - light spectrum of 08 ha @xcite , was necessary for an absorption feature at @xmath84   .",
    "our synow fits suggest the presence of mg  i , ti  i , cr  i , ca  ii , and al  i. @xcite do not predict these species in a thermonuclear explosion when si  iii is strong .",
    "it is likely that the features we attribute to these ions are due to other unidentified species or different velocities for existing ones , though we can not definitively rule out these unusual identifications .",
    "it should also be noted that c  i , o  ii , ni  ii , and co  iii , predicted by @xcite , may be added with little effect on the overall fit .",
    "we were unable to fit the absorption between 3800 and 3900  at this photospheric velocity with anything other than k  ii , though its inclusion would introduce other discrepancies to the fit .",
    "the synow fit in figure [ f : qd_synow_10d ] is derived from parameters used to fit 02cx at 12 days past maximum @xcite , except the velocities and blackbody temperature have been reduced to accommodate the unique nature of 07qd .",
    "this fit was chosen due to its consistency in representing 08 ha , 02cx , and 05hk at similar epochs , as is seen in figure [ f : qd_hk_cx ] .",
    "the similarity is especially apparent with 08 ha , which shares most absorption features with 07qd .",
    "the relative shift between these two spectra was measured to be @xmath85 km @xmath77 ; the photospheric velocity of 08 ha at this epoch is 2000 km s@xmath3 , while the best - fit synow photospheric velocity of 07qd is @xmath86 km s@xmath3 with a blackbody temperature of 8000  k. though @xcite found an excellent match to the 14-day spectrum of 08 ha with a low photospheric velocity of only 600 km s@xmath3 , we attempted our fits with the fe  ii estimated velocity of 2000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "much of the continuum is dominated by narrow fe  ii lines , with co  ii playing a large role below 5000   as well , consistent with most iron - core sn @xcite .",
    "the modified synow fit also continues to include a prominent si  ii feature at 6300    necessitated by the inability of fe  ii to fit it without losing other features .",
    "this si  ii resides within the photosphere and enhances the spectrum at @xmath87   , but less so at @xmath88    and @xmath89   .",
    "the carbon and vanadium measured at 3 days past maximum are not prominent at any ionization stage .",
    "their existence can not be ruled out , in part due to the influence of the dominant fe  ii lines @xcite .",
    "the cr  ii in the 02cx fit by @xcite is also not necessary , as there is insufficient data to examine regions below 3750    at this and later epochs .",
    "we were unable to identify any ionization stage of ti at this epoch , despite the possibility of observing ti  i at 3 days past maximum .",
    "@xcite identified ti  ii at the same epoch in 08 ha , but its addition here does little to the overall fit .",

    "the secondary absorption lines s  ii are no longer apparent at this epoch , as sc  ii is able to effectively represent the 54005700    region without aid .    the signal - to - noise ratio of the data appears to be lower than it actually is , due to the low - velocity nature of this particular photosphere .",
    "much of the absorption blending in the regions blueward of 4500    proved difficult to fit with synow models , especially where p - cygni profiles are no longer apparent ; it is suspected to be a consequence of the narrow absorption features of several iron - group elements .",
    "h@xmath70 and helium ions were tested in synow fits , though no match could be found .",

    "similar to the prototypical sn  1992a @xcite , 04eo is characterized as a fast - declining sn  ia with slow photospheric velocities .",
    "however , it retains an absolute @xmath1 maximum of @xmath93 mag ( within the range of `` normal '' sn  ia ) and still fits the phillips ( 1993 ) relation .",
    "spectroscopically , 04eo contains strong si  ii and s  ii lines , typical of sn  ia .",
    "when the spectra of 07qd are blueshifted to coincide with the photospheric velocity of 04eo , many common features become apparent , especially the si  ii and s  ii lines .",
    "figure [ f : qdvseo ] shows a normalized comparison between early - time spectra of 07qd and 04eo that highlights both the presence and the relative strengths of these lines .",
    "similarly , we may compare the maximum - light spectra of 07qd , 08 ha , and 05hk , as seen in figure  [ f : qdvshk_3d ] .",
    "the spectra of both 07qd and 08 ha , with photospheres blueshifted by 2000 km  s@xmath3 and 1750 km  s@xmath3 ( respectively ) , mirror many of the major features .",
    "although the si  ii and s  ii profiles are noticeably stronger in 07qd and 08 ha , their presence in 05hk is clear .",
    "the similarity between 07qd and 05hk below 5000    is striking  identical structures in this region are indicative of similar iron - group contributions .",
    "the greatly different photospheric velocities apparent in 07qd and 05hk are examined along with 02cx and 08 ha in figure [ f : vphot_bmax ] , suggesting a relation between the luminosities and expansion velocity in these peculiar cases .",
    "we used the fourier cross - correlation subroutine ( fxcor ) in iraf to determine the average offset of the similar features in these spectra , namely the fe  ii and si  ii lines .",
    "the average photospheric velocities of 07qd are faster than those of 08 ha at all epochs when both have measured spectra , but lower than those of any other 02cx - like event .",
    "we compare at 1012 days past maximum because it is here that we have spectra of all four of these 02cx - like sn . to first order",
    ", we extrapolated the photospheric velocity of 07qd at maximum to be roughly 200 km s@xmath3 greater than that of 08 ha , implying a larger kinetic energy by a factor of 1.14 ( assuming the same ejected masses for both sn ) . since our calculation in ",
    "3.1 assumes nickel mass is directly related to luminosity and varies with the rise time by a @xmath94 change in @xmath4ni mass per day , the rise - time dependence is small . as a result",
    ", the plot of the photospheric velocity versus peak luminosity suggests that the @xmath4ni yield ( via maximum brightness and rise time ) and kinetic energy per unit mass ( via photospheric velocity ) are correlated in 02cx - like events .    through fxcor",
    ", the average rate of decline in the photospheric velocity is found to be @xmath95 km s@xmath3 day@xmath3 for the 6355    si  ii line and @xmath96 km s@xmath3 day@xmath3 for the other absorption features ( dominated by fe  ii ) . both of these values group the velocity evolution of 07qd amongst the faint sn  ia described by @xcite , and they are smaller in magnitude than those of 08 ha ( @xmath97 km s@xmath3 day@xmath3 for si  ii and @xmath98 km s@xmath3 day@xmath3 for all other ions ) .",
    "it is difficult to determine the si  ii velocities after maximum brightness for 05hk and 02cx since they are quickly blended with fe  ii lines .",
    "@xcite found for both 05hk and 02cx that the velocities of the 4555    fe  ii line and the ca  ii h&k lines remained constant at roughly 6000 km s@xmath3 for several weeks , implying that the overall expansions were quite slow even for typical sn  ia .",
    "if we assume a constant deceleration through late times , the 700 km s@xmath3 fe  ii lines found 227 days past maximum in 02cx imply a 23 km s@xmath3 day@xmath3 decline @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy in figure [ f : finderchart ] shows a prominent bar and two major spiral arms .",
    "the low inclination allows minor spiral arms to be distinguishable , one of which contains the location of 07qd .",
    "the classifications of sbb or sbc suggest ongoing star formation , but 02cx - like sn  ia appear to span a wide variety of galactic morphologies @xcite .",
    "the keck - i spectrum also included the host galaxy s core in the long slit , allowing a measurement of the oxygen abundance .",
    "we used both the optimized method recommended in @xcite and the @xmath99/[\\mathrm{o~ii}]$ ] diagnostic to arrive at an oxygen abundance in the host galaxy of @xmath100 .",
    "this is equivalent to the sun s oxygen abundance of @xmath101 @xcite , but it exceeds that of the host galaxy of 08 ha , measured to be @xmath102 by @xcite using n2 and o3n2 diagnostics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the striking similarity of the + 10 day ( relative to @xmath1 maximum ) spectrum of 07qd to that of 08 ha suggest that they are indeed similar explosions .",
    "since 07qd is also spectroscopically linked to 05hk and thus to 02cx as well ( see figure  [ f : qdvshk_3d ] ) , these four peculiar events range in peak luminosity by 4 mag , but constitute a single spectral class .",
    "@xcite argued that 08 ha and possibly other 02cx - like objects are actually core - collapse sn ; their low luminosity is the result of either the collapse of a @xmath103 m@xmath104 star directly to a black hole , or electron capture in the core of a 78 m@xmath104 star .",
    "however , the clear presence of imes ( notably si  ii @xmath1056355 and s  ii @xmath1065968 , 6359 ) in 07qd suggests low - density thermonuclear burning and not a core - collapse sn  ib or sn  ic explosion ( see @xcite for a review of sn spectroscopic classification ) .",
    "except for the photospheric velocities , the spectra of 07qd are similar to those of sn 1992a - like sn  ia , further strengthening the arguments that it is a thermonuclear runaway .    the presence of these imes mirrors the findings of @xcite .",
    "sn  ibc have been observed with traces of si  ii @xcite or s  ii @xcite .",
    "however , these lines are quite strong in 07qd , suggesting that it is a sn  ia rather than a core - collapse event . additionally , the light curve of 07qd ,",
    "though displaying a sharp rise that is unusual for a typical sn  ia , does not show the fast decline typical of a low - luminosity sn  ic or the `` plateau '' of a sn  iip that achieves similar peak luminosity .",
    "the energy released by 07qd is substantially lower than that of normal sn  ia , but the predicted nickel mass serves as an intermediate example between 08 ha and 05hk , further linking the two .    when compared with other 02cx - like sn , spectra of 07qd mirror that of 08 ha and display striking relationships to others .",
    "these comparisons also imply that strong si  ii is possible in 02cx and 05hk , though  disguised \" by fe  ii blending due to their higher photospheric velocities .",
    "the fast evolution of 07qd suggests that these imes are only detectable for a brief time , and become masked by fe  ii or recombine as the photosphere slows and cools .",
    "the presence of carbon and oxygen ions in the photosphere echoes the results of deflagration models including those of @xcite , suggesting the presence of unburned white dwarf material and supporting that this class stems from such a progenitor .    also of interest",
    "is the `` sn .ia '' model , which concerns doubly degenerate white dwarf pairs undergoing a helium flash strong enough to produce @xmath4ni and absolute @xmath10 magnitudes as low as @xmath107 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this model to predict the luminosities and rise times that we observe , but also spectra dominated by the he - burning products ca and ti ( detected but not prominent ) .",
    "combined with the low observed expansion velocities , we find 07qd to be an unlikely sn .ia candidate .",
    "our estimated radioactive nickel yield for 07qd ( @xmath108 m@xmath109 ) is extremely small , and it is difficult to understand how such a weak thermonuclear explosion could disrupt a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf .",
    "@xcite found that a minimum of @xmath110  ergs of nuclear energy is required to unbind a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf , and that can be achieved by producing 0.3  m@xmath74 of @xmath4ni .",
    "this amount is more than ten times the @xmath4ni yield we estimate for 07qd .",
    "of course , nonradioactive elements might dominate the nuclear energy term ; for example , the production of 0.37  m@xmath74 of imes could also disrupt the star .",
    "however , the synthesized elements in three - dimensional pure - deflagration models discussed by @xcite are dominated by the iron peak , especially @xmath4ni , over imes .",
    "it is also possible that the synthesis of nonradioactive @xmath111ni or other stable iron - group elements may supply at least some of the kinetic energy .    to estimate the nickel yield , we have applied `` arnett s rule '' @xcite , which allows us to use the peak luminosity as an indicator of the radioactive energy deposition .",
    "the rule assumes that nearly all of the energy produced by nickel and cobalt decays is trapped and converted to ultraviolet , optical , and infrared radiation .",
    "calculations by @xcite indicate that complete trapping is an excellent approximation for the first month after the explosion when the nickel distribution is concentrated toward the center .",
    "deflagration models suggest that rayleigh - taylor instabilities cause hot nickel bubbles to rise as cooler unburned material sinks .",
    "@xcite find fairly uniform distributions of @xmath4ni in radially averaged three - dimensional pure - deflagration simulations .",
    "this leaves more radioactive nickel in the outer layers of the ejecta than predicted in detonation models and implies that some of the radioactive energy will be lost . additionally , @xcite suggest that highly asymmetric deflagrations could both unbind a white dwarf and provide the mechanism through which heavy iron - group elements may be transported to the surface without a detonation .",
    "the ejected mass estimated for 07qd is very low , as is the case for 08 ha @xcite , perhaps suggesting a sub - chandrasekhar mass explosion . however , even normal sn  ia events such as sn  1992a @xcite appear to have ejected less than a chandrasekhar mass of material based on similar assumptions .",
    "91bg - like events also give significantly low ejected masses from the methods currently being applied .",
    "we suspect that some important physics is being ignored in the ejected mass calculations and the results should be considered ambiguous .    the presence of cobalt and high photospheric temperatures in the early - time spectra support the conjecture that radioactive elements were mixed up to the outer layers of 07qd . but",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that a uniform @xmath4ni distribution should only result in a 10% to 30% error in the nickel - mass estimate from arnett s rule , not the order of magnitude needed to reconcile the energetics .",
    "an `` inverted '' sn  ia , where most of the nickel is in the outer layers of the ejecta ( assume @xcite @xmath112 values are @xmath113 ) , would result in inefficient @xmath114-ray deposition and extreme violation of arnett s rule .",
    "such a @xmath4ni distribution , however , is likely to result in the ejecta turning optically thin to @xmath114-rays very early .",
    "@xcite used the characteristic time for sn  ia to become optically thin to @xmath114-rays , @xmath115 , as a way to estimate the ejected mass and kinetic energy .",
    "they found that @xmath115 ranges between 25 and 35 days for normal sn  ia , coinciding with a range of ejecta and nickel masses .",
    "@xcite showed that for a fixed ejecta mass , opacity , and density structure , @xmath116 , so pushing radioactive nickel away from the center ( smaller nickel concentration parameter @xmath112 ) will shorten the time it takes for the ejecta to become optically thin .",
    "figure [ f : bol_luminosity ] shows the quasi - bolometric luminosity curve ( constructed from @xmath20 photometry ) for 07qd and displays radioactive energy deposition curves parameterized by the fiducial time , @xmath115 .",
    "for high optical depths , the curves should obey arnett s rule and pass through the light - curve maximum .",
    "the models that become optically thin to @xmath114-rays soon after explosion have the freedom to be shifted to higher nickel yields as the radioactive energy deposition will match the luminosity after maximum light .",
    "the best match to the observations is for @xmath117  days , suggesting the ejecta are efficiently trapping radioactive energy a month after maximum brightness .",
    "the optically thin curves decline much faster than the data , implying that arnett s rule applies even for this weak explosion .",
    "02cx and 05hk , measured more than 200 days past maximum , continued to exhibit narrow p - cygni profiles in their spectra @xcite . 08 ha appears to be consistent with this @xcite , so 07qd may be relatively opaque to optical photons and @xmath114-rays for some time .",
    "\\(1 ) 07qd was spectroscopically similar to both 08 ha and 05hk .",
    "strong lines of fe  ii and co  ii are present in spectra of all three objects , while fe  iii and ime features are most visible at early epochs , though their optical depths decline quickly .          findings ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) point toward thermonuclear burning during the explosion of 07qd , while points ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) emphasize that 07qd completes a sequence of 02cx - like sn  ia both energetically and spectroscopically . the composition and velocity of the ejecta support the picture of a deflagration",
    ". however , deflagration models such as @xmath118 used by @xcite do not predict the short rise time and small nickel mass seen in 07qd or 08 ha .",
    "the small amounts of synthesized radioactive nickel argue against the unbinding of a chandrasekhar - mass progenitor , but if the fusion is dominated by imes at the expense of nickel , the explosions of massive white dwarfs are still possible .",
    "other possible scenarios are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) the explosions are thermonuclear with sub - chandrasekhar masses .",
    "this would decrease the progenitors gravitational binding energies , thus lowering the ejecta masses and internal energies needed to disrupt the stars .",
    "\\(b ) arnett s rule does not apply to this class of objects , implying that the @xmath4ni mass is significantly underestimated .",
    "the bolometric light curve of 07qd , however , suggests that arnett s rule is operational to some degree .",
    "the low velocities and energies present in 08 ha and 07qd enable the analysis of many aspects of 02cx - like sn , otherwise hidden by the fe  ii blending present in 05hk and 02cx . though the velocities and energies span a wide range , together they constitute a well - defined group of peculiar sn  ia .",

    "<S> we present multi - band photometry and multi - epoch spectroscopy of the peculiar type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) 2007qd , discovered by the sdss - ii supernova survey . </S>",
    "<S> it possesses physical properties intermediate to those of the peculiar sn  2002cx and the extremely low - luminosity sn  2008 ha . </S>",
    "<S> optical photometry indicates that it had an extraordinarily fast rise time of @xmath0  days and a peak absolute @xmath1 magnitude of @xmath2 at most , making it one of the most subluminous sn  ia ever observed . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up spectroscopy of sn  2007qd near maximum brightness unambiguously shows the presence of intermediate - mass elements which are likely caused by carbon / oxygen nuclear burning . near maximum brightness , sn  2007qd had a photospheric velocity of only 2800  km  s@xmath3 , similar to that of sn  2008 ha but about 4000 and 7000  km  s@xmath3 less than that of sn  2002cx and normal sn  ia , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the peak luminosities of sn  2002cx - like objects are highly correlated with both their light - curve stretch and photospheric velocities . </S>",
    "<S> its strong apparent connection to other sn  2002cx - like events suggests that sn  2007qd is also a pure deflagration of a white dwarf , although other mechanisms can not be ruled out . </S>",
