    "understanding the deviation from the fermi liquid behavior at phase transition critical points is a current research question .",
    "the most important are deviations from quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity near quantum critical points .",
    "theory proposes that origin of non fermi liquid behavior is scattering of conducting electrons by bosonic critical soft modes . in case of ferromagnetic transition",
    "these modes are collective spin excitations whose relaxation time diverges near the transition point . in nearly magnetic metals at temperatures larger than inverse spin relaxation time resistivity due to electron scattering by spin fluctuations , strongly deviates from fermi liquid quadratic dependence . it becomes linear or even saturates.@xcite in strongly stoner enhanced paramagnetic metals deviation might starts at very low temperature .",
    "it was experimentally shown that in the region near quantum critical point , magnetic state of many systems experience first order phase transition with separation of different phases.@xcite in this case the temperature dependence of resistivity is characterized by non - fermi liquid resistivity exponents , which depend on proximity of the system to the quantum critical point . and it was shown that dynamics of magnetic state in this case is not critical .",
    "nonuniform magnetic state can be considered as a distinctive phase itself .",
    "@xcite for example in metamagnetic transition of thin magnetic films magneto - dipole interaction can give rise to formation of magnetic domains.@xcite in another example domains can be formed in spatially random variation of effective magnetic field .",
    "this model was proposed to explain unusual magnetotransport effects of ferromagnetic alloys.@xcite    the phase separation in first order magnetic phase transition might exists in considerable range of temperature , pressure and other parameters . in broadened phase transition",
    "the ratio of phases volume , structure and area of phase boundary depend on temperature . in broadened phase transition",
    "such factors as large difference in phases resistivity , or strong electron scattering by the phase boundary can strongly influence temperature dependence of electronic kinetic properties of material .",
    "in this paper we consider the temperature dependence of resistivity due to scattering of conducting electrons by domain walls fluctuations in broadened metamagnetic first order phase transition .",
    "domain walls correspond to crossover from states with low magnetization to high magnetization .",
    "theoretically domain walls between phases appear in regions of space where two minima of free energy have equal value .",
    "the contribution to resistivity will only be significant when the wall fluctuations relaxation time is comparable or larger than that of the volume magnetic fluctuations .    the paper is organized as following . in section slowromancap2@ we give a description of the system of coupled conducting electrons and itinerant electrons responsible for metamagnetic state .",
    "we propose a model where the magnetic state splits in to domain walls . in section",
    "slowromancap3@ we obtain solution for the domain wall profile and consider the fluctuations around it .",
    "we then obtain dynamical magnetic susceptibility of the domain wall fluctuations . in section",
    "slowromancap4@ the temperature dependence of the resistivity caused by the scattering of conducting electrons by the domain wall fluctuations is considered .",
    "we find transition from quadratic to linear temperature dependence with increasing temperature . while this temperature dependence coincides with that due the volume spin - fluctuations .",
    "@xcite , it starts at much lower temperature . in section",
    "slowromancap5@ we discuss the interaction correction@xcite at small temperatures .",
    "it is known that conducting electrons scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations results in important contributions to the temperature dependence of conductivity.@xcite we obtain that for domain wall fluctuations the interaction correction to conductivity has temperature dependence predicted for the 2d volume spin fluctuations.@xcite",
    "we consider a three dimensional metallic metamagnet where @xmath0 electrons are considered to be conducting , and @xmath1 electrons responsible for the magnetic state .",
    "coupling of conducting electrons with bosonic modes is obtained by integrating out @xmath1electrons.@xcite action describing conducting electrons in random impurity potential @xmath2 is @xmath3\\psi_{\\alpha}({\\bf r},\\omega_{n}),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 describes electrons with spin @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 , matsubara frequency @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is temperature ) , with fermi level @xmath9 , and we have set @xmath10 . we assume impurity potential to satisfy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 - density of electrons per one spin , @xmath14 - is the electron mean free time .",
    "the free energy of the magnetic state is described by two energetically unequal minima .",
    "application of magnetic field brings the system in to a state at which these two minima have the same energy , this point is called metamagnetic phase transition point and the value of the magnetic field at which it occurs is called metamagnetic value of magnetic field . at the metamagnetic phase transition point we will be describing the free energy of the metamagnetic state by two parabolas with minima at @xmath15 , corresponding to high and low magnetization states . in this case",
    "the domain walls originate from the spatial deviation of the magnetic field from its metamagnetic value , and we introduce such deviation as @xmath16 ( see figure 1 ) . assuming strong magnetic field we only consider longitudinal component of magnetization density @xmath17 ( in units of @xmath18 ) in the action . having above assumptions in hand we write the action describing the magnetization density @xmath19 in the form @xmath20=\\int_{0}^{1/t}d\\tau\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left(\\frac{k}{2\\chi_{0}}\\left(\\mathbf{\\nabla}m\\left(\\mathbf{r},\\tau\\right)\\right)^{2 } \\right .",

    "this assumption greatly simplifies further calculations , and does not affect main conclusions about resistivity temperature dependence .",
    "we assume the spatial distribution of the @xmath24 to be of the gaussian form and give the averaging procedure in the appendix .",
    "the last term in ( [ action ] ) is the landau damping described by @xmath25=\\int d{\\bf r}^{\\prime}d{\\bf r}~ t\\sum_{\\omega_{n } } m\\left({\\bf r},\\omega_{n}\\right)\\gamma({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{\\prime},\\omega_{n } ) m\\left({\\bf r}^{\\prime},\\omega_{n}\\right),\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is the bosonic matsubara frequency . at this point",
    "it is necessary to distinguish two cases of the form of the damping .",
    "when the scattering of conducting electrons by impurities is ballistic the fourier image of @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , which is valid for large momenta @xmath29 where @xmath30 is fermi velocity , and @xmath31 is a damping constant .",
    "@xcite in case of diffusive scattering the damping is @xmath32 which is valid for @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the diffusion constant .",
    "@xcite    finally , action describing coupling of conducting electrons with magnetization is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is operator of spin density of conducting electrons along the longitudinal component of magnetization , @xmath37 is a phenomenological coupling constant .",
    "in this section we give a solution to the mean field equation for the domain wall and discuss fluctuations around this solution .",
    "let @xmath38 be a coordinate normal to the domain wall and @xmath39 , so that at @xmath40 it is state with high magnetization , and at @xmath41 it is a low magnetization state . here",
    "@xmath42 is a 2d coordinate along the two dimensional domain wall .",
    "equation for magnetization is obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) and we get @xmath43 when @xmath24 is slowly varying function on a scale of @xmath44 the domain wall can be approximated as flat . with this assumption",
    "the solution of ( [ mean - field ] ) describing the domain wall is @xmath45    let us consider fluctuations near this solution . taking second derivative of free energy",
    "we obtain equation for eigenfunctions , which describe fluctuations @xmath46 deriving this equation we have used the equality @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 type potential in equation ( [ delta ] ) is related to non analytical dependence of free energy on magnetization .",
    "the equation ( [ delta ] ) has only one bounded solution , thus strongly simplifying consideration of fluctuations . at slowly varying @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "one can search for the solution of equation ( [ delta ] ) in the form of a plane wave in @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 and assuming @xmath54 we find @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 . at slowly varying @xmath57",
    "we find that @xmath58 and we approximate @xmath59 . in this case @xmath60",
    "dynamics of spin fluctuations is governed by the landau damping ( [ damping ] ) which for excitation described by @xmath61 translates to @xmath62 where as an example we used ballistic case . at small momenta @xmath63",
    "we have for the ballistic case @xmath64 same procedure for the diffusive case gives @xmath65 the dynamical susceptibility of one domain wall fluctuations is represented in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 we consider a locally flat domain boundary .",
    "this can be justified if scale along wall @xmath68 is much smaller than domain wall curvature",
    ". typical scattering of conducting electrons by fluctuations of the domain wall is characterized by the momentum of the order of @xmath69 . which is much larger than the momentum of the dynamical susceptibility of fluctuations .",
    "this allows to separately average over the domain wall direction and position , introducing concentration of wall @xmath70 .",
    "the average over random @xmath71 is approximated by substituting the average value of @xmath71 in to the susceptibility .",
    "the details of the described above averaging steps are given in the appendix to the paper .    from ( [ chi - omega ] )",
    "we see that relaxation time of domain wall fluctuations is proportional to @xmath72 which is much larger than that of the volume fluctuations since @xmath73 . at small @xmath71 contribution of the domain wall fluctuations to the total susceptibility of the system",
    "is approximately @xmath74 which can be of the same order as @xmath23 depending on the parameters .",
    "let us consider contribution to the resistivity due to domain wall scattering of conducting electrons .",
    "there are three temperature dependent contributions to the conductivity .",
    "they are due to scattering of conducting electrons by fluctuations of domain wall , due to domains walls shape change when temperature increases , and due to variation of concentration of walls @xmath70 .",
    "first two contributions are considered in this section and have a common nature .",
    "third contribution depends on position on the phase diagram .",
    "we discuss its contribution in the conclusions of the paper .",
    "resistivity due to electron scattering by spin fluctuation is obtained in second order perturbation theory in interaction ( [ coupling ] ) and is expressed through imaginary part of averaged susceptibility as @xcite @xmath75 here @xmath76 where @xmath13 is density of states of conducting electrons per spin , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath6 are fermi momentum , density , and mass of conduction electrons respectively .",
    "in addition the fluctuations give temperature dependent contribution to the average magnetization of wall .",
    "fluctuation part of magnetization is determined by derivative @xmath79 of fluctuation part of the free energy @xmath80 .",
    "this leads to a change of the domain wall profile and gives additional temperature dependence of resistivity proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "sum of both contributions to the resistivity is given by @xmath82 term , proportional to @xmath83 , is due to @xmath84 .",
    "our calculations show that despite of the difference in damping in ballistic ( [ ballistic damping ] ) and diffusive ( [ diffusive damping ] ) regimes the temperature dependence of resistivity has the same form for both of the cases .",
    "it is quadratic at temperatures lower than the inverse relaxation time and linear at larger temperature . we get that in the ballistic scattering regime at temperatures @xmath85 resistivity has quadratic temperature dependence @xmath86 and at temperatures @xmath87",
    "the dependence is linear @xmath88 here @xmath89 . in case of diffusive scattering regime",
    "we get that the resistivity dependence of the temperature has the same form with @xmath90 modified as @xmath91 .",
    "the transition from quadratic @xmath92 to linear @xmath8 dependence corresponds to transition from quantum to thermal fluctuations of domain wall .",
    "we would like to notice that the same temperature dependence holds for scattering by volume spin fluctuations , except for the difference of effective @xmath90 in ballistic and diffusive cases .",
    "@xcite let us compare resistivity temperature dependence ( [ quadrat ] ) and that @xmath93 due to volume spin fluctuations . in the considered temperature range",
    "the volume contribution is quadratic and @xmath94 .",
    "@xcite ratio @xmath95 can be of order of one .",
    "at low temperatures important resistivity temperature dependence is related to weak localization and electron interaction corrections .",
    "@xcite here we are going to discuss contribution to the conductivity originating from the interplay between electron inelastic scattering by domain wall fluctuations and elastic scattering by impurities . the triplet channel contribution to the conductivity after disorder averaging",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath96 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\operatorname{im}\\int \\frac{d^{3}q}{(2\\pi)^{3}}b({\\bf q } , \\omega ) \\chi({\\bf q } , \\omega),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we also averaged over the positions of the domain walls after which the equation above became isotropic . in the ballistic regime @xmath97 one can use the following approximation @xmath98 which is valid for @xmath99 , and the expression for the domain wall profile fluctuations propagator at small momenta @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "we only consider temperature dependent terms of the correction .",
    "we find that at temperatures @xmath102 and @xmath103 the correction to the conductivity is logarithmic in temperature @xmath104 at higher temperatures @xmath105 and @xmath106 the correction to the conductivity is linear @xmath107 at higher temperatures the correction decays as @xmath108 .",
    "now let us discuss the diffusive regime at @xmath109 . in this case",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 approximated at small momenta @xmath112 .",
    "most singular contribution arises from @xmath113 , and @xmath114 . where @xmath115 is the electrons mean free path .",
    "calculations show that at temperatures @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 the contribution to the conductivity is @xmath119 we would like to point out that we have not considered all of the possible regimes of parameters , focusing on the most interesting cases .",
    "expressions ( [ interactioncorrection1 ] ) , ( [ interactioncorrection2 ] ) , and ( [ interactioncorrection3 ] ) have a 2d temperature behavior while obtained for the 3d electron system .",
    "@xcite the resistivity correction is obtained by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the drude conductivity .",
    "we considered the temperature dependence of resistivity due to electron scattering by spin fluctuations of domain walls .",
    "we showed that in case of weak pinning @xmath122 the relaxation of domain wall fluctuations is much slower than relaxation of volume spin density . therefore , classical regime of fluctuations characterized by linear temperature dependence starts at much lower temperature than for the volume fluctuations . in considered temperature range contribution of volume fluctuations to resistivity",
    "is always @xmath123 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , that additional resistivity in considered system is proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "depending on relation between average magnetic field and metamagnetic @xmath125 the concentration @xmath124 can change with the temperature . in considered temperature range the concentration changes with the temperature as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and the sign of @xmath128 depends on the average magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath129 is relaxation time of volume fluctuations .",
    "parameter @xmath130 determines renormalization of free energy due to volume spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite for example in schematic phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 the @xmath70 decreases in the region @xmath131 when @xmath125 increases with temperature .    in case when @xmath132 there can be a cancelation of quadratic temperature dependence of volume contribution to resistivity by the contribution of domain walls @xmath133 . in case of the cancelation , obtained results ( [ linear ] ) , ( [ interactioncorrection1 ] ) , and ( [ interactioncorrection2 ] ) will be dominant . and the total resistivity will have quasi - linear non - fermi liquid temperature dependence .",
    "this work was financially supported by aro under grant no .",
    "w911nf-09 - 1 - 0527 .",
    "here we show the averaging procedure over the direction of domain walls and random @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that magnetic field is described by gaussian distribution such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 . when parameter @xmath137 is small the magnetic field becomes a slowly varying random function @xmath138 .",
    "typical phase boundary in such a random field is smooth .",
    "position of domain wall is defined by the following equation @xmath139 note , that under this definition we neglect cases when in small closed regions there is no solution of mean field equation ( [ mean - field ] ) for favorite phase , or energy associated with it is too high .",
    "here @xmath142 is a point on the surface , and @xmath143 is a vector normal to the surface at the point @xmath142 defined as @xmath144 . in ( [ sur - int ] )",
    "@xmath145 is a one dimensional fourier transform in the direction normal to the surface .",
    "we now can average the dynamical susceptibility of the number of domain wall .",
    "for one domain wall the susceptibility is given by expression ( [ dyn - sus ] ) .",
    "scale along the surface of the domain wall that we are interested in is @xmath68 , here @xmath146 and the @xmath71 is estimated as @xmath147 therefore @xmath148 is smaller than the radius of surface curvature @xmath149 , and under averaging procedure we can use the expression ( [ dyn - sus ] ) .",
    "then the average susceptibility is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a fourier transform of @xmath61 defined by ( [ psi-0 ] ) , and @xmath152    at @xmath153 the @xmath154 is a normal to the surface and therefore is also normal to @xmath155 .",
    "therefore in ( [ dynamic1 ] ) we can separately average over the direction and value of @xmath154 , considering @xmath156 only in the limit of @xmath157 . in case of gaussian distribution @xmath156",
    "is calculated analytically as @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 here @xmath161 and @xmath162 are perpendicular and parallel components to @xmath155 consequently .",

    "the factor @xmath165 under the integral of expression ( [ dynamic1 ] ) is estimated as @xmath166 .",
    "so averaging of quantities like susceptibility does not diverge at small @xmath71 and can be approximated by inserting average @xmath71 . finally , the averaged susceptibility over the domain wall positions is given by the next expression : @xmath167 where @xmath71 is approximated by its average value . at small momenta @xmath100 fourier",
