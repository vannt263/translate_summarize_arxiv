    "nano junctions using single molecules have attracted wide attention in recent year @xcite . in order to investigate the atomic scale single molecular junctions",
    ", it is important to characterize a single molecule bridging between metal electrodes using some spectroscopic measurements . as for the spectroscopy of the single molecule junctions , point contact spectroscopy ( pcs )",
    "@xcite , inelastic tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) @xcite , and action spectroscopy have been investigated for the single molecule junctions @xcite . in these spectroscopies ,",
    "electron current through the single molecule junction is measured as a function of bias voltage . in the iets and pcs ,",
    "spectrum is obtained as an inelastic scattering event of electrons with sufficient energy to excite certain vibration mode .",
    "the vibration energy is determined from the bias voltage , in which conductance of the single molecule junction abruptly changes .",
    "the difference between pcs and iets is operating conductance regime .",
    "iets operates in low conductance regime ( @xmath2 @xmath31 @xmath4 , where @xmath4 = 2@xmath5 ) , while pcs operates in conductance regime close to 1 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the pcs and iets have been applied for various single molecule junctions with h@xmath0 , c@xmath6 , benzene , alkane dithiol @xcite .",
    "action spectroscopy of the single molecule junction was a recently developed technique to detect the vibration modes of the single molecule junctions @xcite .",
    "the action spectroscopy observes the abrupt conductance change ( peak in @xmath1 spectra ) originated from the structural change of the single molecule junction induced by the phonon excitation .",
    "the energy of the peak provides the vibration energy of the single molecular junction .",
    "the action spectroscopy of the single molecular junction was applied for the single molecular junctions with h@xmath0 , o@xmath7 , and co @xcite . in the case of single molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces ,",
    "the action spectroscopy has some advantage compared to iets @xcite .",
    "it can detect the vibration modes which could not be detected by iets .",
    "in addition , action spectroscopy can be applied for the system , in which iets signal is too weak to detect , since the signal of the action spectra is much larger than that of iets .",
    "the action spectroscopy has been applied for various molecules on metal substrates . on the other hand",
    ", there is little study of the action spectroscopy of the single molecular junction , and thus , the character of this spectroscopy is not clear up to now . it is important to investigate the characters of the action spectroscopy of the single molecular junction . in the present study , the action spectroscopy has been performed for the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment .",
    "this system has been already investigated by the conductance measurement , @xmath1 spectra , and theoretical calculation by other groups @xcite .",
    "however , iets or pcs of this system has not been obtained up to now , and the energy of the vibration mode was not fixed yet .",
    "the structure of the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 environment was not defined . in the present study",
    ", the atomic configuration of the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment was investigated by the conductance measurement , action spectroscopy . here",
    "it should be noticed that hydrogen has large zero point energy due to its small mass .",
    "since the action spectroscopy detects the structural change of the single molecular junctions induced by the phonon excitation , it provides the information of the atomic motion of the single molecular junction .",
    "the effect of the zero point motion on the atomic scale structural change of the single molecule junction could be revealed by the action spectroscopy . in the present study ,",
    "we have investigated the effect of the zero point motion on the atomic motion of the single molecular junction by investigation of the action spectroscopy of the au atomic contacts in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment .",
    "the measurements have been performed using the mechanically controllable break junction ( mcbj ) technique ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description ) . a notched au wire ( 0.1 mm in diameter , 10 mm in length ) was fixed with epoxy adhesive ( stycast 2850 ft ) on top of a bending beam and mounted in a three - point bending configuration inside a vacuum chamber . in ultra high vacuum at 4 k , the au wire was broken by mechanical bending of the substrate , and clean fracture surfaces were exposed .",
    "the bending could be relaxed to form atomic - sized contacts between the wire ends using a piezo element for fine adjustment .",
    "h@xmath0 or d@xmath0 gas was admitted to the contacts via a capillary .",
    "dc two - point voltage - biased conductance measurements were performed by applying a bias voltage in the range from 10 to 300 mv .",
    "every statistical data set was built from a large number ( over 3000 ) of individual digitized conductance traces .",
    "ac voltage bias conductance measurements were performed using a standard lock - in technique .",
    "the conductance was recorded for fixed contact configuration using an ac modulation of 1 mv amplitude and a frequency of 7.777 khz , while slowly ramping the dc bias between -100 and + 100 mv .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows typical conductance traces and histograms for au contacts before and after introduction of h@xmath0 . the stretch length was the displacement of the distance between the stem parts of the au electrodes which were fixed on the substrate . before introduction of h@xmath0 , conductance decreased in a stepwise fashion , with each step occurring at integer multiples of @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding conductance histograms showed a peak near 1 @xmath4 , which corresponded to a clean au atomic contact .",
    "after introduction of h@xmath0 , the conductance decreased multi - stepwise fashion below 1 @xmath4 .",
    "the widths of the multiple steps were not well - defined , and showed various value less than 1 @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding conductance histogram showed a broad feature below 1 @xmath4 .",
    "the appearance of steps and features below 1 @xmath4 agreed with the previously reported results @xcite . here , it should be noticed that the return conductance traces showed the steps around 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath4 , before making large contacts .",
    "the certain atomic configurations showing conductance values below 1 @xmath4 would be formed in both breaking and making contacts .",
    "the differential conductance ( @xmath1 ) spectra were measured for the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 environment at a conductance value of 0.1 - 0.5 @xmath4 .",
    "three types of @xmath1 spectra were observed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the first `` normal '' spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) showed an increase in the differential conductance symmetrically around 45 mev , and clear symmetric peaks were observed in the second derivative ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the second `` peak '' spectrum ( fig .  [ fig2](b ) ) showed symmetrical peaks , and the third `` non symmetric '' spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ) did not show any symmetric features .",
    "the third `` non symmetric '' spectra were most frequently observed for the au contact in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment .",
    "the increase in conductance observed for the `` normal '' spectra could be explained by the phonon excitation at the single molecular junction @xcite .",
    "the single - channel model predicts conductance enhancement below a transmission probability of 0.5 and suppression of conductance above this . in the present study ,",
    "the spectra were measured for the junction having zero bias conductance below 0.5 @xmath4 .",
    "the increase in the conductance agreed with the theoretical prediction . in the single molecular junction having low conductance , an additional tunneling channel for electrons was opened , when the bias voltage was increased and crossed the threshold for excitation of a vibration mode .",
    "this opening of the new channel resulted in a sudden increase in the differential conductance at the threshold voltage . here",
    ", it should be noticed that @xmath1 spectra of the au atomic contacts in h@xmath0 environment has not been obtained before @xcite . in the present study , we could measure the vibration spectra of this system by measuring the carefully prepared sample .",
    "the peak observed in the `` peak '' spectra could be explained by the abrupt switching between two slightly different local geometric configurations induced by the phonon excitation @xcite .",
    "action spectroscopy observes these peaks to determine the energy of the vibration mode .",
    "the non symmetric feature in the `` non symmetric '' spectra could be explained by interference of electron waves which scatter on defects or impurities close to the contact @xcite .",
    "since the distribution of the defects or impurities and shape of the left and right electrodes would be different from each other , that is , non symmetric , the non symmetric feature could appear in the spectra .",
    "the conductance fluctuation is most enhanced for the contact showing a conductance value around 0.5 @xmath4 , if the conductance channel is a single one channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , the `` non - symmetric '' spectra were most frequently observed for the au contact in h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment showing conductance of 0.1 - 0.5 @xmath4 .    in order to determine the vibration energy from action spectra , 122 differential conductance spectra showing peaks in @xmath1 spectra",
    "were collected for junctions having conductance of 0.05 - 0.4 @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the distribution of vibration energy .",
    "the broad features were observed around 33 and 66 mev .",
    "the two modes were also observed for the `` normal '' @xmath1 spectra .",
    "the vibration mode of 33 mev was observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "since the phonon energy of the au atomic contact is around 10 - 20 mev @xcite , the observed vibration modes would be the vibration modes of the bonding between au and hydrogen .",
    "the distribution of the vibration energy could not be defined for the au contact in d@xmath0 environment due to the difficulty in obtaining the `` peak '' spectra .",
    "the structure of the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 environment is discussed based on the present experimental results and previously reported theoretical calculation result @xcite .",
    "after introduction of h@xmath0 , the au contact showed a conductance value below 1 @xmath4 .",
    "the vibration modes between au and hydrogen were observed around 33 and 66 mev in the action spectra .",
    "the interaction between au atomic contact with h atom or h@xmath0 molecule have been investigated by dft calculation @xcite .",
    "h atom and h@xmath0 molecule were stably incorporated into the au atomic contact . because of the incorporation of hydrogen into the contact , the conductance of the au atomic contact decreased from 1 @xmath4 to 0.6 - 0.01 @xmath4 , depending on the atomic configuration of the contact .",
    "the decrease in conductance was possibly due to scattering or interference of conducting electrons in the contact .",
    "no preferential atomic configurations were found for the hydrogen incorporated au atomic contact .",
    "although there was no clear difference in conductance between the au atomic contact with a single h atom and h@xmath0 molecule , there was clear difference in the vibration energy between two contacts @xcite .",
    "the au atomic contact with a h atom showed the vibration mode around 150 - 220mev corresponding to the vibration of the h atom along the contact axis .",
    "comparatively , the au atomic contact with a h@xmath0 molecule showed two transverse modes of the h@xmath0 molecule around 25 - 150 mev , in addition to the internal h@xmath0 stretching mode around 180 - 250mev .",
    "these experimental and theoretical calculation results indicated that a h@xmath0 molecule bridged au electrodes in the present experimental condition .",
    "the formation of the au / h@xmath0/au junction was supported by the conductance trace .",
    "in the return conductance trace , the conductance jumped to a conductance value of 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 . before making the contact",
    ", h@xmath0 molecules would adsorb on au electrodes without dissociation . in making the contact",
    ", a single h@xmath0 molecule would probably bridge au electrodes in the initial stage .",
    "the vibration mode was also observed around 30 - 50mev for the contact having conductance of 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 , which was formed in making the contact .",
    "the close agreement in conductance and vibration energy supported that the atomic contact ( conductance : 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 , vibration energy : 40 mev ) formed in breaking the contact would be similar to that in making the contact , and that a single h@xmath0 molecule would bridge au electrodes .",
    "now , the au atomic contact in h@xmath0 environment was well characterized by the conductance measurement , action spectra of the single molecule junction , and theoretical calculation . briefly",
    ", the effect of surrounding hydrogen molecules on the au / h@xmath0/au junction is discussed . in the present experimental condition , hydrogen molecules would adsorb on the au / h@xmath0/au junction . since the interaction between the hydrogen molecule and the hydrogen molecule in the au / h@xmath0/au junction would be small ,",
    "the conductance and vibration energy of the au / h@xmath0/au junction would be insensitive to the presence of the surrounding hydrogen .",
    "next , @xmath1 spectra of the au / h@xmath0/au and au / d@xmath0/au junctions were discussed .",
    "three types of spectra ( `` normal '' , `` peak '' and `` non symmetric '' ) were observed in @xmath1 spectra .",
    "there was clear difference of the distribution of spectra between the au / h@xmath0/au and au / d@xmath0/au junctions .",
    "the percentage of the `` normal '' , `` peak '' and `` non symmetric '' spectra were 7 @xmath9 .",
    "20 @xmath9 , 73 @xmath9 for the au / h@xmath0/au junction , and 6 @xmath9 , @xmath10 1@xmath9 , and 94 @xmath9 for the au / d@xmath0/au junction , respectively .",
    "the `` peak '' spectra ( action spectra ) were frequently observed for the au / h@xmath0/au junction , while they were not observed for the au / d@xmath0/au junction .",
    "the peak in the @xmath1 spectra is discussed using a model of vibrationlly induced two level systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the potential curve of the molecular junction is represented as the double well potential with ground states @xmath11 and meta stable @xmath12 in the two energy minima .",
    "the two energy minima are separated by the activation barrier ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the molecular junction could be vibrationally excited by the conduction electron .",
    "if the junction is fully exited , the junction with ground state @xmath14 could overcome the activation barrier , and change into the junction with meta stable @xmath15 , which leads to the abrupt change in conductance ( peak in the @xmath1 spectra ) .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states have slightly different local geometrical configurations , such as adsorption site of a h@xmath0 molecule to au electrodes , molecule tilt angle , configuration of the au electrodes .",
    "appearance of the `` peak '' spectra only for the au / h@xmath0/au junction indicated that the structural change could occur only for the au / h@xmath0/au junction .",
    "the difference between the two single molecule junctions is discussed by considering the zero point energy of the single molecular junction .",
    "since a h@xmath0 molecule has half the mass of a d@xmath0 molecule , the energy of au - h@xmath0 vibration mode and zero point motion would be larger than those for d@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the potential curve would be the same for both single molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 would be smaller for the au / h@xmath0/au junction than that for the au / d@xmath0/au junction .",
    "the structural change could , thus , easily occur for the au / h@xmath0/au junction due to smaller @xmath13 .",
    "the difference in the @xmath1 spectra between the au / h@xmath0/au and au / d@xmath0/au junction could be also explained by the number of the excitation process accompany the structural change .",
    "if @xmath13 was larger than the energy of the au - h@xmath0 ( d@xmath0 ) vibration mode , the system should be excited into the states with higher vibrational quanta in a ladder climbing manner in order to overcome activation barrier for the structural change @xcite . in the multiple excitation process",
    ", the excitation of the system would be getting harder with the number of the excitation process .",
    "the number of the excitation process to overcome the activation barrier would be smaller for the au / h@xmath0/au junction than that for the au / d@xmath0/au junction due to the larger energy of the au - h@xmath0 vibration mode .",
    "therefore , the structural change could easily occur for the au / h@xmath0/au junction .",
    "the above discussion was supported by the previously reported result @xcite .",
    "thijssen et al .",
    "reported that the `` peak '' spectra were observed for the au contact in both h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 environment .",
    "they observed the `` peak '' spectra for the junction having a conductance value around 1 @xmath4 . in the present study ,",
    "the @xmath1 spectra were taken for the junction having a conductance value below 1 @xmath4 ( around 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is because the clear difference in the conductance histogram between clean au contact and au contact in hydrogen environment was observed in the conductance regime around 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 , and thus , the interaction between au atomic contact and hydrogen was clear for the contact showing conductance around 0.1 - 0.4 @xmath4 .",
    "the `` peak '' spectra could not be observed for the au / d@xmath0/au junction . in the case of the vibrational heating mechanism",
    ", the reaction rate ( @xmath16 ) per electron can be represented as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the current and the order of the reaction @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate shows nonlinear power - law dependence on current .",
    "the structural change would occur for the au / d@xmath0/au junction having a high conductance value , while it would not occur for those having a low conductance value .",
    "these experimental results suggested that the structural change in the au / d@xmath0/au junction would be the multiple excitation process .",
    "the formation of the single au / h@xmath0/au and au / d@xmath0/au junction was revealed by the conductance measurement and action spectroscopy . in the @xmath1 spectra , symmetric peaks were observed for the au / h@xmath0/au junction , while symmetric peaks were not observed for the au / d@xmath0/au junction .",
    "the peaks in the @xmath1 spectra originated from the structural change induced by the phonon excitation . in the case of the au / h@xmath0/au junction ,",
    "the structural change induced by the phonon excitation could easily occur because the activation energy for the structural change and the number of excitation process would be small due to the large zero point energy and large energy of the au - h@xmath0 vibration mode .",
