    "@xmath7 is a graph whose @xmath0 vertices can be mapped to points in the plane and whose @xmath8 edges are defined by pairs of points within euclidean distance at most @xmath9 from one another .",
    "alternatively , one can regard the vertices of @xmath7 as mapped to coplanar disks of unit diameter , so that two vertices are adjacent whenever the corresponding disks intersect .    a _ dominating set _",
    "@xmath10 is a subset of the vertices of a graph such that every vertex not in @xmath10 is adjacent to some vertex in @xmath10",
    "independent set _ is a subset of mutually non - adjacent vertices .",
    "an _ independent dominating set _ is a dominating set which is also an independent set . note that any maximal independent set is an independent dominating set .    dominating sets in unit disk graphs",
    "are widely studied due to their application in wireless ad - hoc networks  @xcite .",
    "since it is * np*-hard to compute a minimum dominating set of a unit disk graph  @xcite , several approximation algorithms have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "such algorithms are of two main types . _ graph - based algorithms _ receive as input the adjacency representation of the graph and assume no knowledge of the point coordinates , whereas _",
    "geometric algorithms _ work in the real ram model of computation and receive solely the vertex coordinates as input .",
    "if the coordinates of the @xmath0 disk centers are known , the @xmath8 edges of the corresponding graph @xmath7 can be figured out easily .",
    "it can be done in @xmath2 time under the real ram model with floor function and constant - time hashing , and in @xmath11 time without those operations  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the price of a conversion step , graph - based algorithms can be used when the input is a unit disk realization of @xmath7 . however ,",
    "unless * * p**=*np * , no efficient algorithm exists to decide whether a given graph admits a unit disk realization  @xcite , let alone exhibit one . as a consequence , geometric algorithms can not be efficiently transformed into graph - based algorithms . in this paper , we introduce approximation algorithms of both types , benefiting from the same approximation factor analysis .",
    "the proposed graph - based algorithm runs in @xmath2 time , and the geometric algorithm runs in @xmath4 time regardless of @xmath8 .",
    "[ [ previous - algorithms ] ] previous algorithms + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a graph - based @xmath1-approximation algorithm that runs in @xmath2 time was presented in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm computes a maximal independent set , which turns out to be a @xmath1-approximation because unit disk graphs contain no @xmath12 as induced subgraphs , as shown in that same paper .",
    "consists of a vertex with @xmath13 pendant neighbors . ]    polynomial - time approximation schemes ( ptas ) were first presented as geometric algorithms  @xcite and later as graph - based algorithms  @xcite .",
    "also , a graph - based ptas for the more general disk graphs was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the complexities of the existing ptass are high - degree polynomials . for example , the ptas presented in  @xcite takes @xmath14 time to obtain a @xmath1-approximation ( the analysis from  @xcite ) .",
    "although its analysis is not tight , the running time is too high even for moderately large graphs .",
    "the reason is that these ptass invoke a subroutine that verifies by brute force whether a graph admits a dominating set with @xmath15 vertices .",
    "the verification takes @xmath16 time , and it is unlikely that this can be improved ( unless * * fpt**=*w[1 ] * , as proved in  @xcite ) . such a subroutine is applied to several subgraphs , and the value of @xmath15 grows as the approximation error decreases .",
    "a similar strategy was used in  @xcite to obtain a ptas for the minimum independent dominating set .",
    "the lack of fast algorithms with approximation factor less than @xmath1 was recently noticed in  @xcite , where geometric algorithms with approximation factors of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and running times respectively @xmath19 and @xmath20 were presented .",
    "while a significant step towards approximating large instances , those algorithms require the geometric representation of the graph , and their running times are still polynomials of rather high degrees .",
    "linear and near - linear - time approximation algorithms constitute an active topic of research , even for problems that can be solved exactly in polynomial time , such as maximum flow and maximum matching  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to contrast the minimum dominating set problem with the maximum independent set problem . while a maximal independent set is a @xmath1-approximation to both problems , it is easy to obtain a geometric @xmath18-approximation to the maximum independent set problem in @xmath4 time  @xcite . in the graph - based version ,",
    "a related strategy takes roughly @xmath21 time , though .",
    "no similar results are known for the minimum dominating set problem .",
    "the existing ptass for the minimum dominating set problem in unit disk graphs are based on some packing constraints that apply to unit disk graphs .",
    "one of these constraints is the _ bounded growth property _ :",
    "the size of an independent set formed by vertices within distance @xmath22 of a given vertex , in a unit disk graph , is at most @xmath23 .",
    "note , however , that the bounded growth property is not tight . for example",
    ", for @xmath24 , it gives an upper bound of @xmath25 vertices where the actual maximum size is @xmath1 .",
    "since the bounded growth property is strongly connected to the problem of packing circles in a circle , obtaining exact values for all @xmath22 seems unlikely  @xcite .",
    "[ [ our - contribution ] ] our contribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our main result consists of the two approximation algorithms given in section  [ s : algorithm ] : a graph - based algorithm , which runs in linear @xmath2 time , and its geometric counterpart , which runs in @xmath26 time in the real ram model , regardless of the number of edges .",
    "the approximation factor of both algorithms is @xmath3 .",
    "the strategy in both cases is to construct a @xmath1-approximate solution using the algorithm from  @xcite , and then perform local improvements to that initial dominating set .",
    "our main lemma ( lemma  [ l : irreducible ] ) uses forbidden subgraphs to show that a solution that admits no local improvement is a @xmath3-approximation . since the dominating sets produced by our algorithms are independent sets , the same approximation factor holds for the independent dominating set problem .",
    "proving that a certain graph is _ not _ a unit disk graph ( and is therefore a forbidden induced subgraph ) is no easy feat .",
    "we make use of an assortment of results from discrete geometry in order to prove properties of unit disk graphs that are interesting _ per se_. for example , we use universal covers and disk packings to show that the neighborhood of a clique in a unit disk graph contains at most @xmath27 independent vertices .",
    "these properties , along with a tighter version of the bounded growth property , are collected in section  [ s : forbidden ] , and allow us to show that certain graphs are not unit disk graphs .",
    "consequently , the analyses of our algorithms employ a broader set of forbidden subgraphs which include , but are not limited to , the @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , in section  [ s : partial ] , we show that a possible , somewhat natural refinement to our graph - based algorithm leads to a tighter @xmath5-approximation , albeit for the price of an extra @xmath28 multiplying factor in the time complexity of the algorithm .",
    "in this section , we introduce some lemmas about the structure of unit disk graphs . these lemmas will be applied to prove our approximation factors in sections  [ s : algorithm ] and [ s : partial ] .",
    "we start by stating three previous results from the area of discrete geometry .",
    "the first lemma comes from the study of universal covers ( for a recent survey see  @xcite ) .",
    "[ l : universal_cover ] if a set of points @xmath29 has diameter @xmath9 , then @xmath29 can be enclosed by a circle of radius @xmath30 .",
    "packing congruent disks in a circle is a well - studied problem .",
    "exact bounds on the radius of the smallest circle packing @xmath15 unitary disks are known for some small values of @xmath15 , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the bound for @xmath33 will be useful to us .",
    "[ l : pack13 ] the radius of the smallest circle enclosing @xmath34 points with mutual distances at least @xmath9 is @xmath35 .    the _ density _ of a packing is the ratio between the covered area and the total area .",
