    "the quark model has been introduced fifty years ago @xcite as a realization of the @xmath1 symmetry and it has been used with success for the description of many important properties of hadrons , as the existence of multiplets , their quantum numbers and the magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the idea of quarks as effective particles ( constituent quarks ) emerged very early @xcite and was further developed with the introduction of the colour quantum numbers .",
    "here we shall concentrate ourselves on constituent quark models ( cqm ) for baryons .",
    "after the pioneering work of isgur and karl ( ik ) @xcite a series of cqm followed : the relativized capstick - isgur model ( ci ) @xcite , the algebraic approach ( bil ) @xcite , the hypercentral cqm ( hcqm ) @xcite , the chiral goldstone boson exchange model ( @xmath2cqm ) @xcite , the bonn instanton model ( bn ) @xcite and the interacting quark - diquark model @xcite .",
    "all models reproduce the baryon spectrum , which is the first quantity to be approached when building a model for the baryon structure , but have been widely used to describe baryon properties . in some cases the calculations referred to as a cqm one are performed using a simple h.o .",
    "wave function for the internal quark motion either in a nonrelativistic ( ho ) or relativistic framework ( rho ) .",
    "the photocouplings for the excitation of the baryon resonances have been calculated in various models , among others we quote ho @xcite , ik @xcite , ci @xcite , bil @xcite , hcqm @xcite ( for a comparison among these and other previous approaches see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations reproduce the overall trend , but the strength is systematically lower than the data . the fact that quite different models lead to similar results can be ascribed to their common @xmath3 structure .",
    "as for the nucleon elastic form factors there are the calculations performed by bil @xcite with the algebraic method and by the rome group @xcite within a light front approach based on the ci model .",
    "the hcqm has been firstly applied in the nonrelativistic version with lorentz boosts @xcite and then it has been reformulated relativistically @xcite . a quite good description of the elastic form factors is achieved also using the gbe @xcite and the bn @xcite models , both being fully relativistic .",
    "the same happens for the interacting quark - diquark model @xcite , specially in its relativistic version @xcite .",
    "a sensible test of both the energy and the short range properties of the quark structure is provided by the @xmath0 behaviour of the helicity amplitudes for the electromagnetic excitation to the baryon resonances .    in the ho framework , there are various calculations of the transverse helicity amplitudes , among them we quote refs .",
    "@xcite , while a systematic rho approach has been used by @xcite .",
    "a light cone calculation , using the ci @xcite model , has been performed @xcite and then successfully applied to the @xmath4 @xcite and roper excitations @xcite . for more recent light cone approaches , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the algebraic method has been also used for the calculation of the transverse helicity amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the hcqm , in its nonrelativistic version , has produced nice predictions for the transverse excitation of the negative parity resonances @xcite and , recently , for both the transverse and longitudinal helicity amplitudes of all resonances having a sensible excitation strength @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the helicity amplitudes in a relativistic hcqm is in progress and some preliminary results for the @xmath4 resonance are now available @xcite .",
    "helicity amplitudes have been calculated also by the bonn group , both for the nonstrange @xcite and strange resonances @xcite .",
    "the models have been applied also to the decays of baryons .",
    "the strong decays have been quite soon calculated with the ik model @xcite and in its relativized versions @xcite .",
    "there are also calculations in other models , namely bil @xcite , gbe @xcite . as for the hcqm",
    ", there are some preliminary calculations @xcite .",
    "there are also calculations of the semileptonic decays of baryons in the bn model @xcite .",
    "finally we quote calculations of the axial nucleon form factors in the gbe @xcite and bn @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a nonrelativistic description of the internal quark dynamics was considered very early @xcite after the introduction of the quark model . in this framework",
    ", one can introduce the three - quark wave function @xmath5 , factorized according to the various degrees of freedom : @xmath6 in agreement with the pauli principle , the wave function @xmath7 must be totally antisymmetric for the exchange of any quark pair .",
    "baryons must be colour singlets and the corresponding wave function @xmath8 is by itself antisymmetric , therefore the remaining factors must be completely symmetric .",
    "actually a symmetric quark model has been formulated before the introduction of the colour quantum numbers and the symmetric three - quark states have been classified @xcite .",
    "early lattice qcd calculations @xcite showed that the quark interaction can be split into a long range part , which is spin and flavour independent and contains confinement , and a short range spin - dependent one @xcite .",
    "this means that one can assume the dominant part to be @xmath3 invariant and the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ 3q ] ) becomes @xmath9 in order to satisfy pauli principle , the product @xmath10 must be symmetric and then both factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 must have the same permutation symmetry , that is symmetric ( s ) , antisymmetric ( a ) or one of the two mixed symmetry types ( ms , ma ) , which are distinguished by the symmetry or the antisymmetry with respect to a quark pair .    it should be reminded that each quark belongs to the fundamental @xmath3 representation with dimension 6 and that with three quarks one can obtain the following @xmath3-representations : @xmath13 the corresponding symmetry type is , respectively , a , m , m , s.            the suffixes in the r.h.s .",
    "denote the multiplicity @xmath17 of the @xmath18 spin states and the underlined numbers are the dimensions of the @xmath1 representations .",
    "this means for instance that the @xmath19 representation contains a spin-@xmath20 @xmath1 octect and a spin-@xmath21 @xmath1 decuplet .",
    "the various baryon resonances can be grouped into @xmath3-multiplets , the energy differences within each multiplet being at most of the order of @xmath22 as in the case of @xmath23 mass difference and of the splittings within the @xmath1 multiplets . in fig .",
    "[ baryon ] we report the experimental non strange baryon spectrum , including only the three- and four- star states @xcite . the notation for the @xmath3-multiplets is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the dimension of the @xmath3-representation , @xmath26 is the total orbital angular momentum of the three - quark state describing the baryon and @xmath27 the corresponding parity .",
    "an alternative but equivalent notation is @xmath28 , where t is the symmetry type of the @xmath3 representation .",
    "the fact that the @xmath29 and @xmath30star non strange resonances can be arranged in @xmath3 multiplets indicates that the quark dynamics has a dominant @xmath3 invariant part accounting for the average multiplet energies , while the splittings within the multiplets are obtained by means of a @xmath3 violating interaction , which can be spin and/or isospin dependent and can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the various constituent quark models are quite different , but they have a simple general structure in common , since in any case , analogously to what stated above , the quark interaction @xmath31 can be split into a spin - flavour independent part @xmath32 , which is @xmath3-invariant and contains the confinement interaction , and a @xmath3-dependent part @xmath33 , which contains spin and eventually flavour dependent interactions @xmath34       in tables [ statpos ] and [ statneg ] , we give the explicit form of the three - quark states with positive and negative parity , respectively . in these tables the hyperradial wave functions @xmath35 are solutions of the hyperradial equation eq .",
