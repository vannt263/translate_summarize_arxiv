    "high precision timing on single photo - electron ( spe ) ( @xmath2  ps ) is needed for pattern reconstruction and background suppression . moreover , the continuos @xmath3 beam with a planned 20  mhz average interaction rate ( with peaks up to 50  mhz ) , sets a minimum requirement of 100  khz per channel .",

    "a modular design with a preamplifier add - on card allows the realization of versatile fee .",
    "different detectors can be readout , for example plastic scintillators which usually deliver large signals produced by the energy loss of charged particles .",

    "two nino chips per card ( one per layer ) are used for a total of 16 readout channels .",
    "three commercial digital to analog converter chips ( dac ) set the working parameters of the nino chips like common thresholds , hysteresis and pulse stretcher widths ( offset for the input tot ) . in particular , the dacs define voltage offsets ( from 0 to 3.3v ) which are added to the inputs of each nino channel .",
    "these connections allow the definition of individual thresholds for every nino channel , which by design only have one common threshold per chip .",
    "the communication with the dacs is via a serial peripheral interface ( spi ) connection .",
    "the nino provides lvds ( low voltage differential signal ) output , which is fed through a specific adapter to the trb3 daq .",
