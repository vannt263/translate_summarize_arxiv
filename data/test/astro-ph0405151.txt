    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are intense transient bursts of x - rays , similar to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) but characterized by a stronger x - ray than @xmath7-ray fluence @xcite . it has been speculated that xrfs are indeed linked to grbs .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed : xrfs may be grbs viewed sufficiently off - axis ( @xcite ) , or more massive explosions than those that make grbs , leading to a smaller lorenz factor for the jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the real nature of the observed difference between grbs and xrfs is not yet known .",
    "both grbs and xrfs are extragalactic sources . a number of grbs",
    "have now been localized , and they are all cosmological .",
    "interestingly , the three nearest long grbs ever localized are all associated with spectroscopically confirmed supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "although the case of grb  980425/sn  1998bw @xcite was controversial , that of grb  030329/sn  2003dh is established beyond doubt ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "grb  031203 at @xmath8 also appears to have hosted a sn possibly similar to sn  1998bw ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all these sne are of type ic ( sne  ic ) , and display very high - velocity ejecta .",
    "sne  ic are thought to originate from the collapse of the cores of massive stars that have lost both their h and he envelopes , exploding as c+o stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sne 1998bw and 2003dh have been successfully modelled as highly energetic explosions ( the spherical kinetic energy is @xmath9 times that of a normal sn : @xcite ) , ejecting @xmath3 10 @xmath4 of material and synthesizing @xmath3 0.5 @xmath4 of @xmath1ni , much more than in normal core - collapse sne .",
    "the aspherical models require lower energy , but still @xmath10 times higher than a normal sn @xcite .",
    "these sne  ic and others , not known to be associated with grbs but showing the spectroscopic signatures of a high explosion energy @xmath11 erg ) , have been called hypernovae . both the kinetic energy and the mass of @xmath1ni  of sne  ic may positively correlate with progenitor mass @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , only a few xrfs have been accurately localized ( to less than a few arcmin ) thus far , and only one of these is known to be at low redshift : xrf  020903 at @xmath12 @xcite . in the case of xrf  030723 ,",
    "only upper and lower redshift limits could be determined , because the host galaxy could not be observed @xcite .",
    "the lower limit , @xmath13 , follows from the non - detection of the host , while the upper limit , @xmath14 , was derived from the lack of ly@xmath15 absorption down to 4000 @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite obtained optical photometry and spectroscopy of xrf  030723 .",
    "the @xmath17-band light curve ( lc ) of the xrf counterpart showed a ` bump ' , which may be the signature of a sn component .",
    "other interpretations are possible ( e.g. , a two - jet model @xcite ) , but @xcite claimed that they could rule them out based on the sed evolution . interpreting the bump as a sn sets further limits on the redshift ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite compared the bump with the lcs of different sne  ic , concluding that the best match was given by the rest - frame @xmath19-band lc of sn  1994i , at a redshift @xmath20 .",
    "sn  1994i was a normally - energetic sn  ic , with low - mass ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , the featureless spectrum of the bump obtained by @xcite makes them favour a broad - lined , highly energetic sn , like sn  1998bw or sn  2002ap .    in this paper",
    ", we model the observed lc using different sn  ic models , both normally- and hyper - energetic , and explore various redshifts to determine the possible range of the parameters of the sn associated with xrf  030723 .",
    "assuming that the sn in xrf  030723 is of type ic , by analogy with the cases of grb - associated sne , we computed synthetic @xmath21 bolometric lcs of exploded c+o star models .",
    "we used an lte radiation hydrodynamical code and a gray @xmath7-ray transfer code @xcite .",
    "the electron - scattering opacity was calculated from the solution of the saha equation , while the line opacity was fixed at 0.03 @xmath22 , the value that was used to model sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the total opacity is @xmath23 ",
    "0.1 @xmath22 ( compared to the range 0.05  0.15 @xmath22 for sn  1994i : @xcite ) .",
    "the accurate line opacity is unknown , if it is bigger , the timescale of lc peak becomes longer .",
    "we started from four different c+o star explosion models : co21 , a normal sn ic model developed for sn  1994i @xcite ; co100 , an energetic model developed for sn  1997ef @xcite ; co100/4 , a scaled - down version of co100 developed for sn  2002ap @xcite ; and co138 , a model for the very energetic sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the model parameters , i.e. ejected mass @xmath24 , kinetic energy @xmath25 , and progenitor main - sequence mass @xmath26 are summarized in table [ omodel ] .    given the uncertain redshift , we considered three values : @xmath27 , 0.6 , and 0.8 .",
    "the observed @xmath17-band roughly corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath28-band if @xmath27 , the @xmath19-band if @xmath20 , and the @xmath29-band if @xmath30 . because of time - dilation ,",
    "the observed lc corresponds to narrower rest - frame lcs for increasing redshifts . on the other hand , in sne",
    "ic the lc peak is narrower for bluer bands . coincidentally ,",
    "these two effects roughly cancel out .",
    "we scaled the masses of the above c+o models , conserving their explosion energies , and calculated synthetic lcs to find which scalings yield the best - fit models .",
    "since the code computes bolometric lcs , the monochromatic lcs were estimated using bolometric corrections ( bcs ) .",
    "as spectral and color information about the possible sn is very limited , we used the bcs of known sne ic as templates .",
    "these were calibrated in time with respect to the lc peak to match the apparently fast evolution of the sn .",
    "we used the bc template appropriate for the parameters of each model . for low - mass , low - energy models",
    ", we used the bcs of sn  1994i ( assuming @xmath31 ; @xcite ; b. schmidt & r. kirshner 1994 , private communication ) .",
    "in other cases , the model parameters indicated energetic explosions , and then we adopted the bcs of a suitable hypernova and recalculated the model lc . in order to match the observed flux , we modified the mass of @xmath1ni  synthesized for different redshifts and models .",
    "powers the sn lc through the decay chain @xmath1ni  @xmath32 @xmath1co  @xmath32 @xmath1fe .",
    "model parameters affect the synthetic lc .",
    "the timescale of the lc peak , @xmath33 , is determined by the combination of photon diffusion and ejecta expansion and depends on @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 @xcite , where @xmath37 represents the effect of the density structure and @xmath1ni  distribution and @xmath38 is the model - dependent average opacity .",
    "the parameters of our best - fit models are listed in table  [ model ] , as are the template bcs used , and the computed synthetic lcs are compared to the observed lc in figures [ z03 ] , [ z06 ] , and [ z08 ] for the three redshifts .",
    "the observed lc was derived from the @xcite r - band photometry by subtracting the beuermann extrapolation of the power - law component of the afterglow . as expected , for every value of @xmath34 ( i.e. , for every model )",
    "there is a value of the ejected mass for which the synthetic lc reproduces the observations .",
    "had we been able to model the spectra , we could have uniquely constrained the value of the kinetic energy .",
    "however , the spectral information is limited .",
    "@xcite discussed that the sed of the bump is consistent with that of a sn similar to sn  1998bw , and that the only , low signal - to - noise spectrum is better consistent with a broad - lined sn like sn  1998bw or sn  2002ap than a narrow - lined one like sn  1994i .",
    "we discuss these points later .    because the lc peak of the sn in xrf  030723 is intrinsically narrow , the only models that give satisfactory results without major modifications to their mass values are models co21 , which is scaled up somewhat , and co100/4 , which has to be scaled down ( the top panel of figure  [ em ] ) .",
    "all other models were originally developed for the high - mass hne and must be scaled down in mass significantly to yield a narrow lc peak .",
    "the delayed lc - rise of the sn in xrf  030723 , compared with the hyper - energetic sne 1998bw and 2002ap ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can not be reproduced by models with uniform @xmath1ni  mixing .",
    "instead , we had to assume that @xmath1ni  is distributed only in the inner 10% of the ejected mass in our modelling .",
    "this increases the photon diffusion time , leading to a delayed onset of the lc .",
    "the total @xmath1ni  mass is @xmath3 0.012 ",
    "0.015 @xmath4 if @xmath39 , @xmath3 0.07  0.12 @xmath4 if @xmath40 , and @xmath3 0.1  0.3 @xmath4 if @xmath41 .",
    "these estimates would change if we could take into account the unknown @xmath42-corrections .",
    "for example , the @xmath42-correction of sne ia between the observed @xmath17- and rest - frame @xmath19-bands , @xmath43 , at @xmath44 is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "if a similar value was applied here ( sne ic show some overall spectral similarity to sne ia ) , the @xmath1ni  mass for @xmath44 would decrease to @xmath3 0.04 @xmath4 . in the case",
    "@xmath39 the relevant @xmath42-correction for sne ia , @xmath46 , varies between @xmath47 and @xmath48 near the peak , which suggests that the @xmath1ni  mass could decrease to @xmath49 0.01 @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath42-correction for @xmath41 , @xmath50 , is possibly positive for sne ic because of the very small flux in the @xmath29-band .",
    "this could make the @xmath1ni  mass larger than 0.25 @xmath4 .",
    "all the models discussed above can reproduce the observed lc . given the limited spectral information , it is unfortunately not easy to select among them .",
    "however , based on their properties , we can at least attempt to narrow down the range of possibilities .    in figure  [ em ] , the basic parameters of the best - fit models are compared with the properties of four well - studied sne  ic of various energies .",
    "the _ top panel _ is a plot of @xmath51 vs. @xmath25 for the various models and sne .",
    "the _ bottom panel _ shows how @xmath52 varies depending on the assumed redshift , all other model properties being the same .",
    "redshift affects both the estimated sn luminosity and the bcs adopted in the lc modelling .",
    "based on this plot , we can select the models that are likely to be applicable to the sn in xrf  030723 , assuming that it is a sn ic .",
    "the models for the observed type ic sne are also plotted .",
    "first we discuss the low - redshift case ( @xmath27 ) . in this case , the mass of @xmath1ni  is very small ( @xmath53 ) for all models .",
    "this value is much smaller than even in a normal sne  ic like sn  1994i , suggesting that @xmath27 is a significant underestimate of the real redshift if the observed bump is in fact a sn .",
    "however , if xrf  030723 really occurred at @xmath27 , then strong fall - back and/or a low - energy sn must be invoked to explain such a small @xmath1ni  mass .",
    "if fall - back is strong , much of the synthesized @xmath1ni  may be captured by the compact remnant , like in some type ii sne which eject very little @xmath1ni  ( e.g. , sn  1997d , @xcite ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the explosion energy of the sn is too low to synthesize much @xmath1ni .",
    "the @xmath34 ",
    "@xmath35 relation of our best - fit models suggests that sne with @xmath54 as low as , e.g. , @xmath55 would have the correct lc and may be expected to synthesize little @xmath1ni as is required for @xmath27 .",
    "such sne must come from low - mass c+o stars , originating from main - sequence stars of @xmath56 .",
    "next we consider the high - redshift case ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this sets an upper limit for the ejected @xmath1ni  mass at @xmath57 0.3 @xmath4 .",
    "combined with the tendency of actual sne ic to produce more @xmath1ni  for increasing @xmath51 and @xmath25 , this in turn sets an upper limit to @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "the ejecta mass of the sn in xrf  030723 is probably less than @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59 @xmath4 ) , and the kinetic energy less than @xmath60 erg .",
    "these values are smaller than in the grb - associated sne .",
    "it is very unlikely that the sn can be as massive as sne 1998bw @xcite or 2003dh @xcite for two reasons : first , the kinetic energy would be extremely high ( @xmath61 erg ) , and secondly , it would be strange for such a hyper - energetic explosion only to synthesize @xmath3 0.2 @xmath4 of @xmath1ni .    if the redshift @xmath62 is @xmath3 0.6 , the required @xmath1ni  mass is @xmath63 . both the sn  1994i - like model @xmath64co21 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 erg , @xmath2(@xmath1ni ) @xmath67 ) and the sn  2002ap - like model @xmath64co100/4 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 erg , @xmath2(@xmath1ni ) @xmath70 ) are consistent with the observed relations between @xmath51 , @xmath34 , and @xmath2(@xmath1ni ) .",
    "if the redshift is slightly higher ( e.g. , @xmath71 ) , a larger @xmath2(@xmath1ni ) is required , and a more massive and energetic model ( @xmath72 ; @xmath73  @xmath74 erg ) is probably necessary .",
    "this makes the tentative sn more like sn  2002ap . summarizing , our preferred estimates are for a redshift @xmath75 , consistent with the range favored by @xcite , and sn properties between a normal sn and a low - energy , low - mass hypernova .",
    "these results are consistent with the colors of the putative sn on august 6 and 19 , i.e. , 14 and 21 days after the xrf @xcite .",
    "we made a rough comparison between the xrf and the color evolution of other type ic sne for the three redshifts , neglecting the unavailable k - corrections .",
    "the observed @xmath76 and @xmath77 on august 6 can not be used to distinguish between the three redshifts and between sne 1998bw , 2002ap , and 1994i .",
    "however , the @xmath78 non - detection on august 16 , ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) seems to match sn 2002ap better because the @xmath81 flux is more depressed in sn 2002ap than in sne 1994i or 1998bw .",
    "the detected @xmath82 on aug 14 , however , suggests @xmath83 , which is too big to be consistent with the photometry of sne 1998bw , 2002ap , and 1994i ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the observed @xmath84 on august 16 favors @xmath85 and a comparison with sne 1994i and 2002ap .",
    "support for an sn  2002ap - like object also comes from the apparently featureless spectrum of the bump @xcite .",
    "sn  2002ap has a broad - lined spectrum , much more similar to sn  1998bw than to sn  1994i .",
    "this is the first case of an xrf probably associated with a sn @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the properties of the sn appear to lie at the low end of the distribution of hn properties , or perhaps even to be similar to those of normal sne  ic ( figure  [ em ] ) .",
    "this may be the consequence of an unfavorable orientation which prevented us from seeing the grb and the most energetic part of the ejecta , but it also may indicate a real difference between xrfs and grbs on the one hand and the accompanying sne on the other . if the progenitor of the sn / xrf is really intermediate between those of sn  2002ap and 1994i ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath6 , a black hole may not be formed ( e.g. , if @xmath86 as in @xcite ) , and the central engine may be a neutron star like in the `` magnetar '' model @xcite , instead of the black hole of the `` collapsar '' model for long grbs @xcite .",
    "accurate spectral information , which would have allowed us to constrain the properties of the sn much more tightly , is unfortunately not available .",
    "there is however one case where a normal , or possibly sn  2002ap - like sn  ic was claimed to be associated with a grb ( grb  021211/sn  2002lt , @xcite ) . clearly , more data on the sn  grb / xrf connection are necessary before we can understand the full extent of the relation between these phenomena .",
