    "over the last few years striking evidence has arisen for a non - vanishing neutrino rest mass ( for reviews see refs .",
    "this evidence comes from neutrino oscillations experiments which are not able to measure absolute neutrino masses , because their results depend only on the differences of masses - squared , = @xmath10 , with @xmath11 as the masses of two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed to describe these mass eigenstates on the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "if neutrino masses are in the region larger than 0.1ev they will be almost degenerate , otherwise hierarchical structures can be observed ( normal or inverted ) .",
    "a very sensitive process to probe the absolute neutrino mass is 0 .",
    "double beta decay was first discussed by m. goeppert - mayer  @xcite in the form of ( z , a ) ( z+2,a ) + 2 e^- + 2 |_e ( 2 ) .",
    "this process can be seen as two simultaneous neutron decays . shortly after the classical papers of majorana  @xcite discussing a 2 - component neutrino , racah  @xcite and furry discussed another decay mode in the form of @xcite [ proc0nu ] ( z , a ) ( z+2,a ) + 2 e^- ( 0 ) .",
    "in contrast to neutrino oscillations which violate individual flavour lepton number , but keep total lepton number conserved , 0  violates total lepton number by two units . this process is forbidden in the standard model .",
    "it can be seen as two subsequent steps ( `` racah - sequence '' ) ( z , a ) & ( z+1,a ) & + e^- + |_e + & ( z+1,a ) & + ( z+2,a ) + e^- the quantity measured in 0 is called effective majorana neutrino mass and given for light neutrinos by [ eq : ema]= _ i u_ei^2 m_i = _ i u_ei ^2 e^2i_i m_i which can be written in case of cp - invariance @xmath12 as = m_1 u_e1 ^ 2 m_2 u_e2 ^ 2 m_3 u_e3 ^ 2 the experimental signal of 0  is two electrons in the final state , whose energies add up to the q - value of the nuclear transition , while for the 2 the sum energy spectrum of both electrons will be continuous .",
    "the total decay rates , and hence the inverse half - lives , are a strong function of the available q - value .",
    "the rate of 0 scales with @xmath13 compared to a @xmath14-dependence for 2 .",
    "therefore isotopes with a high q - value ( above about 2mev ) are normally considered for experiments .",
    "this restricts the candidates to eleven promising isotopes . for recent reviews on double beta decay",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .    as an alternative to the ground - state transitions ,",
    "decays into excited 0@xmath2 and 2@xmath2-states of the daughter can be used for the search as well .",
    "this might shed some light on new physics and provide some new information on nuclear matrix element calculations .",
    "observations of 2 transitions into the first excited 0@xmath2-state for and have been reported @xcite . despite a reduced q - value for such transitions a search using the de - excitation gammas alone , or in coincidence with the two electrons ,",
    "provides a clear signal of the decay .",
    "recently there has been a revived interest to study double electron capture for neutrino mass searches .",
    "three different decay channels can be considered combining electron capture ( ec ) and positron emission : ( z , a ) & & ( z-2,a ) + 2 e^+ + ( 2 ) ( ) + e^- + ( z , a ) & & ( z-2,a ) + e^+ + ( 2 ) ( ) + 2 e^- + ( z , a ) & & ( z-2,a ) + ( 2 ) ( ) in particular , the mode shows an enhanced sensitivity to right handed weak currents @xcite .",
    "the experimental signatures of the decay modes involving positrons in the final state are promising because of two or four 511kev photons . despite this nice signature , they are less often discussed in literature , because for each generated positron the available q - value is reduced by @xmath15 , which leads to much smaller decay rates than in comparable 0 due to reduced phase space .",
    "hence , for -decay to occur , the q - values must be at least 2048kev .",
    "only six isotopes are know to have such a high q - value .",
    "the full q - value is only available in the mode , which is harder to detect . in a neutrinoless to the ground state of the daughter a monoenergetic internal bremsstrahlung photon has to be emitted",
    "this requires a k- and an l - shell capture .",
    "recently a resonant enhancement in the decay rate of radiative has been explored ; if the initial and final states are degenerate @xcite , the de - excitation photons will serve as a signal .",
    "thus a wide variety of possible gamma emissions exist .",
    "this paper explores double beta transitions of tin isotopes .",
    "tin contains three double beta emitters , and in the two electron mode and for and decays .",
    "the q - values of the transitions for the three isotopes are 366kev , 2287kev and 1919kev and the natural abundances are 4.63 % , 5.79 % and 0.97 % respectively . as there is no excited state of interest for decay we focus on the decays & & + 2e^- + ( 2 ) + +   + & & + ( 2 ) + +   + & & + ( 2 ) + the decay schemes of and are shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : levels ] .",
    "astonishingly , despite the fact that is one of the eleven isotopes with a q - value larger than 2mev there is currently no experimental suggestion for a large scale experiment .",
    "no theoretical predictions for half - lives exist for and @xmath16sn , calculations are reported for ground state and excited states transitions in @xcite .",
    "ground state limits for and in the range of @xmath17yr have been deduced  @xcite , while for there is a lower limit of @xmath18yrs for the neutrinoless - mode @xcite .",
    "a search for the decay into first excited 0@xmath2 and 2@xmath2-states of is reported in @xcite .    the presence of 511kev gammas in the mode allows a search for a ground state transition in @xmath5sn .",
    "the neutrinoless ground state transition of can be explored by searching for the monoenergetic internal brems - strahlung gamma at @xmath19 = 1888.5kev , with @xmath20 the k- and l - shell binding energy of @xmath5cd .",
    "also interesting is the fact that there might be a degeneracy between and an excited 0@xmath2 state at 1870.9kev in , hence fulfilling the resonance enhancement condition for neutrinoless @xcite .",
    "gamma line energies were taken from @xcite and the latest atomic mass determinations from @xcite .",
    "the setup is schematically shown in fig .  [",
    "pic : setup ] . for the search , a 72  @xmath21 ge - detector was used .",
    "the tin with guaranteed 99.95% purity was mounted in two different ways around the detector .",
    "two concentric rings consisting of 18 tin pieces , each with dimensions 7.25 @xmath0 1.4 @xmath0 0.35 @xmath21 , were mounted around the cylindrical surface of the ge - detector .",
    "the tin pieces were held in place by a thin band of copper braid and further supported by the surrounding copper shielding .",
    "the front part of the ge - detector was covered by two sheets of tin , their size determined by the size of the ge - detector and the tin ingot .",
    "the total amount of tin used was 1.24 kg .",
    "the whole set - up was surrounded by 10  cm of clean copper and 1020 cm of lead , slightly dependent on the direction .",
    "the experiment was located in a surface laboratory without neutron shielding so some activity from cosmic sources is expected . due to the presence of background lines from the uranium and thorium decay chains , in - situ",
    "calibrations could be performed .",
    "independent calibrations were performed with @xmath22ba , @xmath23cs , @xmath24na and @xmath25co .",
    "measurement runs were taken in units of hours to optimise data taking .",
    "spectra were recorded with an ortec mca card of 11 bit resolution .",
    "efficiencies of the setup for the gamma rays of interest were studied with the help of geant4 monte carlo simulations . to check the simulation",
    ", detailed calibration runs with @xmath26co , @xmath23cs and @xmath22ba source were performed for a number of different source positions .",
    "the region of interest for the search contains gamma energies in the range of 5001900kev . the energy resolution as a function of energy",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : reso ] .",
    ".[tab : runs ] experimental runs taken .",
    "efficiencies were calculated for each different tin configuration separately .",
    "( run 1 was used for commissioning purposes only ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      two possible decay modes are considered for the ground state transition .",
    "the first one is for the @xmath7 ground state transition based on the emission of an internal bremsstrahlung photon @xcite . due to energy and momentum conservation",
    "this requires one k- and one l - shell capture .",
    "additionally the bremsstrahlung photon has to be monoenergetic , with an energy of the q - value reduced by the k- and l - shell binding energy of the daughter . in the case of this",
    "implies a gamma of 1888.5kev .",
    "the region around this energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : peak1888 ] .",
    "the calculated detection efficiency for such a photon is 0.491 @xmath27 0.007 .",
    "the analysis follows the method described for the excited states and due to non - observation of a peak results in a half - life of t@xmath28 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "as the precise peak position is only known to about @xmath27 2kev due to uncertainties in the atomic masses , the peak position was systematically varied by 0.5kev between 1886 and 1890kev and the fit was repeated for the corresponding position . in this way , the worst half - life limit was found to be ^0ec / ec ( 0^+ 0^+_g.s ) > 9.910 ^ 17  ( 90% cl ) , which thus can be used as a conservative lower limit for the decay .",
    "the second search on the 0@xmath29 ground state transition is based on the creation of 511kev annihilation gammas . however , there is a difference in the search strategy because an excess of an observable background line at 511kev has to be explored .",
    "a possible difference in the intensity of the 511kev might come from internal impurities of the tin as well as due to the fact that 511kev gammas produced externally can be shielded by the tin . as fig .",
    "[ f : background ] shows , the continuum level is actually lower in run 6 with the tin than without .",
    "the amplitude of the 511kev peak was determined for the attenuated background spectrum , ( fitted via eqn .",
    "[ e : atten ] as described earlier ) and for the run 6 spectrum with tin . in these fits ,",
    "the width of the gaussian used to fit the peak was also allowed to vary since 511kev emissions can be subject to doppler broadening ( @xmath30kev wider ) and hence the resolution of this line can not be accurately calibrated .",
    "the region fitted around the 511kev peak is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : peak511 ] for both the tin and background spectra .",
    "the total number of events in the background peak was found to be @xmath31 and for the tin spectrum the total number of events in the peak was @xmath32 .",
    "the difference between these values , @xmath33 events is inconsistent with zero indicating a source of 511kev gammas is present in the tin . as",
    "a cross - check the same procedure was repeated for other background lines ( 351.9 , 583.2 , and 609.3kev ) and no excess was found in any of these other peaks , so the intensity increase of the 511kev line can not be attributed to uranium or thorium contamination in the tin .    assuming the observed events are all due to the double beta decay of @xmath5sn , a half - life of + ^0(2)^+/ec ( 0^+ 0^+_g.s ) = 5.09^+1.17_-0.7910 ^ 17 can be derived , given the efficiency for observing 511kev gammas = 1.175% .",
    "however , the introduction of an additional positron source in the tin can not be ruled out .",
    "further work is required to study possible @xmath34 emitters that could be produced from cosmic - ray interactions or neutron activation in tin . under the assumption that the observed excess of events are all background , a conservative limit of ^0(2)^+/ec ( 0^+ 0^+_g.s ) > 4.110",
    "^ 17  ( 90% cl ) has been deduced .",
    "double beta decay , in its various forms , is a powerful tool for investigating neutrino properties .",
    "many isotopes are being considered for large scale experiments , but so far tin has received little attention .",
    "in addition to which is suitable for @xmath35 searches , tin contains available for decay via the mode , which has never been explored experimentally .",
    "this paper details the first comprehensive search for excited state transitions in tin isotopes and leads to half life limits in the region of @xmath36@xmath37yrs .",
    "ground state transitions for were explored for neutrinoless radiative producing a mono - energetic photon .",
    "the ground state transition could be restricted observing the 511kev line .",
    "a small excess of the line is seen , which results in a rather short half - life if all the excess events are attributed to this signal . however , due to unknown activities in the tin produced by cosmic ray spallation and neutron reactions it is more reliable to quote a limit .",
    "improvements could be obtained with more sophisticated shielding and a better detection efficiency .",
