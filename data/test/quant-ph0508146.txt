    "the famous debate between einstein , podolsky , rosen ( epr ) and bohr @xcite , about the nature of quantum correlations of a bi - partite state has played a key role in the investigation of entanglement properties of light in modern quantum optics , and has initiated a new branch of physics called quantum information .",
    "epr used in their arguments a  wave function that exhibits a perfect correlations between positions and momenta of two massive particles ( labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . in the position and momentum representations the epr state takes the following forms @xmath2    quantum correlations of the entangled epr state have been implemented experimentally for massless particles : photons . in the case of light ,",
    "the quantum mechanical position and momentum observables are played by the electric field : phase and amplitude quadratures .",
    "the well known two - mode gaussian squeezed states of light are physical realization of the epr state .",
    "those states lie at the heart of quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum information @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "there are few efficient ways of producing gaussian epr correlated states .",
    "one of them uses a kerr nonlinear medium in optical fibers to entangle phase and amplitude quadratures @xcite . however , the nonlinearity has to be relatively small to achieve a gaussian state .",
    "the other method uses a beam splitter as a nonlocal operation that creates entanglement .",
    "a typical setup consists of two initially separable amplitude squeezed beams which interfere at the 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "recent applications of entangled two - mode squeezed states of light in quantum information processing have generated a lot of interest in mixed gaussian states .",
    "although there are mathematical criterions for the entangled properties for mixed two - partite gaussian systems @xcite , they are not easy experimentally realizable .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) interference can reveal the quantum nature of entanglement of two - particle mixed gaussian states .",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a quantum witness operator , closely related to the hbt interference @xcite , that probe entanglement of a mixed epr gaussian state . using hong , ou and mandel ( hom ) interferometry",

    "a non - degenerated optical parametric amplification , involving two modes of the radiation field , provides a physical realization of the epr state ( [ epr ] ) .",
    "the quantum state generated in this process has the following form    @xmath3 is a thermal distribution with a mean number @xmath4 of photons in each mode .",

    "the epr state reduces to the pure state given by ( [ nopa ] ) .",
    "as it has been discussed in several papers ( see the tutorial @xcite and references therein ) , this mixed epr state is separable for @xmath15 and its density operator can be expressed in a sum of product states ( werner separability criterion )    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the density operators of the two modes and @xmath19 , with @xmath20",

    "the analysis of second - order interference , can be extended to the case of photon pulses which duration is long compared to the time resolution of photodetector .",
    "such single - photon emitters are already in use @xcite .",
    "a source produces single photon pulses with a relative delay which interfere at the beam splitter .",
    "simple analysis of beam splitter s action on impinging photons shows , that both photons will leave the same outport of the beam splitter .",
    "a relative delay is small enough to keep the pulses partially overlapping . even though the overlapping is not complete , its time duration is longer than the time resolution of the detector .",
    "therefore , the temporal effects can not be neglected any more when detecting pulses and the time delay @xmath44 between detected pulses at two separate detectors has to taken into account .",
    "experiments investigating interference for such pulses with different frequencies have already been performed @xcite .",
