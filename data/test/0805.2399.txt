    "in addition to the choice of @xmath43 , @xmath61 , and @xmath60 as the variables for the calculation , a linear transformation between parameters yields an eigenbasis set of parameters with a multi - normal non - covariant relationship that further reduces the mutual degeneracy amongst the parameters @xcite .",

    "similar to the procedure that defines the prior on @xmath34 , the sme isochrone analysis provides a parametric relationship between @xmath43 versus trial distance and age ( i.e. , for a given stellar radius estimate , the sme isochrone analysis has a best distance and age estimate for the system ) .",

    "other systematic sources of error are most likely comparable or larger than the internal precision .",
    "the sources of systematic error only enter into the prior for @xmath34 . in light of these potential sources of systematic uncertainty , the analysis is repeated with an increased standard deviation of the gaussian prior on @xmath34 to @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "this larger uncertainty on @xmath34 did not increase the uncertainties in the other parameters beyond the most significant digit as given in table  [ tab : star ] and table  [ tab : planet ] .",

    "@xcite note that the scatter around their @xmath95-p trend does not correlate with metallicity .",
    "the previously known sample of transiting planets was shown by @xcite to separate into two classes by the safronov number of the planet .",
    "the safronov number , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the escape velocity from surface of the planet and @xmath98 is the planet orbital velocity , is a measure of the ability of a planet to gravitationally scatter other bodies . @xcite and refined by @xcite find transiting planets fall into categories defined as class i , @xmath99 and class ii , @xmath100 .",
    "xo-5b , @xmath101 does not appear to belong to either class , yet it is not as discrepant as the other outlying transiting planets , gj 436b ( @xmath102 ) and hat - p-2b ( @xmath103 ) @xcite .",
    "there is some overlap , but the planets with higher metallicity stellar hosts tend to be the class ii objects with lower @xmath104 , whereas class i objects have increasing @xmath104 toward lower metallicities",
    ". xo-5b  does not follow this trend , but has high @xmath104 for higher metallicity .",
    "a single object such as xo-5b  does not invalidate the trends amongst the jupiter - class of transiting planets , but illustrates the importance of expanding the number of such objects to fully explore the diversity of this population .",
    "recently , the superwasp project announced 10 new transiting planets .",
    "we look forward to the detailed analysis of these new transiting planets to amplify or diminish the strength of the current trends amongst the close - in transiting planets . the end goal of a large population of transiting planets is to investigate any trends that may directly constrain processes that affect planet formation , migration , and planet survival .",
