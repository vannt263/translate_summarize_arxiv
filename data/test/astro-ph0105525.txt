    "even though a large fraction of the xrb spectral intensity and the source counts are fairly well reproduced by agn synthesis models , a self  consistent description of the xrb constituents has yet to be reached as most of its ingredients have to be extrapolated well beyond the present observational limits .",

    "the luminosity evolution , parameterized with a power law model @xmath17 , stops at @xmath18 = 1.8 and then stays constant up to @xmath19=3 .",
    "the shape and normalization of the luminosity function are slightly different from those adopted in c95 and consistent with the values of boyle et al .",
    "the choice of these parameters is consistent with the more recent estimates of the high redshift agn evolution and also fits well the first _",

    "the input agn spectra , including the subdivision in the @xmath3 classes centered at log@xmath3 = 21.5,22.5,23.5,24.5 , are as described in c95 , while the best fit absorption distribution of obscured agn in the four @xmath3 classes normalized to the space density of unobscured agn , turned out to be 0.35,1.5,2.3,2.0 which is slightly different from that reported by c95 for two reasons .",
    "the first is that some input parameters have been changed as described in the previous paragraph , the second concerns the intensity of the 18 kev xrb spectrum which has to be fitted by the model .",

    "the maximum discrepancy is between the bepposax and heao1a2 observations , the level of the latter being lower by 3040 % in the overlapping 38 kev band , the best fit asca spectrum lies approximately in between and thus we choose to fit the xrb spectral intensity as measured by asca .    the best fit absorption distribution is compared with that derived by risaliti et al .",

    "sources with column densities in excess of 10@xmath21 cm@xmath2 are not included in the present model as their contribution to the xrb is never energetically relevant ( see e.g. gilli et al .",

    "this is probably due to a selection effect . the probability to find a bright source near a , usually , bright target is small , and therefore the number of bright sources in a serendipity survey like the hellas survey tends to be underestimated .",

    "( 2001 ) are slightly overpredicted .",
    "the key parameter of all the xrb models is the space density of obscured agn and their absorption distribution .",
    "it is customary to adopt a ratio between obscured and unobscured objects consistent with the value measured for samples of nearby ( often optically selected ) type 2 and type 1 seyferts galaxies . in the model discussed here such",
    "a ratio is not assumed a priori but determined from the xrb fitting procedure and thus it is obviously dependent on the column density adopted to divide absorbed from unabsorbed objects .",
    "the ratio between obscured and unobscured agn is thus about 4.3 if such a value is set to @xmath28 cm@xmath2 and about 2.4 for @xmath3 = 3 @xmath8 10@xmath29 cm@xmath2 .",
    "we stress that such a ratio is independent from optical classification and thus the relative fraction of x  ray obscured agn in a flux limited survey could be different from the fraction of optically narrow  lined type 2 objects .",
    "it is important also to note that the above quoted values for the ratio between obscured and unobscured objects are referred to the entire agn population responsible for the xrb intensity and that such a number would be recovered only when the full xrb is resolved into single sources .",
    "the fraction of objects with a given column density actually included in a survey depends on the flux limit of the survey and on the energy range .",
    "figure [ fraction ] shows these fractions as a function of the 0.52 , 210 and 510 kev fluxes .",
    "the dependence of the fractions on the flux is smoother in the harder bands ( see comastri 2000 ) . as a consequence , 5 - 10 kev surveys can better probe the real fraction of obscured object going down to fluxes comparatively higher than in the 2 - 10 kev and 0.5 - 2 kev bands . as an example at 510 kev fluxes of the order of",
    "10@xmath26 erg cm@xmath2 s@xmath6 the fraction of objects in the log@xmath3 = 2324 bin is of the order of 25% while is some @xmath30 15 % in the 210 kev band and negligible in the soft 0.52 kev energy range .",
    "in order to investigate to what extent the present data can be used to constrain the absorption and luminosity distribution of the sources making the hard xrb , additional tests of synthesis models have been carried out .",
    "more specifically we have computed 2 models which both reproduce the xrb spectral shape over the 3100 kev energy range with somehow `` extreme '' assumptions on the absorption and luminosity distribution of the obscured sources . in the former case",
    "we have maximized the number of obscured compton thick sources ( about a factor 2 with respect to the baseline model ) , while in the latter a cut  off in the luminosity function of absorbed agn has been introduced for luminosities greater than 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "these attempts are motivated by both theoretical and observational evidence as described below .    an xrb model dominated by a population of almost compton thick ( @xmath32 1 ) sources",
    "has been worked out by wilman et al .",

    "is introduced for 70% of the remaining objects .",
    "we have computed a synthesis model with an absorption distribution dominated by compton thick sources .",
    "the contribution of these sources to the xrb is normalized to that obtained by wilman et al .",

    "the 510 kev predicted counts are reported in figure [ sns ] and compared with the observed hellas counts and with the baseline model predictions .",
    "the y  scale is the product of the integral counts times the flux . in this representation",
    "the fluxes contributing most to the xrb are around the peak of the distribution .",
    "the contribution of compton thick sources is never dominant in the 510 kev band , as a consequence , the bright part of the logn ",
    "logs is not well reproduced by the model where their contribution is maximized .",
    "even though the uncertainties associated with the hard hellas and xmm_newton _ counts do not allow to rule out a large number of highly obscured agn , it is clear that on the basis of present data an @xmath3 distribution peaked at lower column densities has to be preferred .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function of absorbed sources is assumed to be the same of unobscured one in almost all the xrb synthesis models .",
    "the lack of luminous narrow line quasar ( type 2 qso ) in optical surveys has lead several authors ( see the discussion in halpern et al .",
    "1998 ) to conclude that either they are very rare or even do not exist .",
    "we checked the importance of high  luminosity highly absorbed agn by fitting the xrb with a mixture of unabsorbed agn at all luminosities and low  luminosity absorbed agn with an approach similar to that described by gilli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . here a sharp cut  off in the luminosity function of obscured agn is introduced for luminosities greater than 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the shape of the absorption distribution is the same of the baseline model ; however , in order to reproduce the xrb spectral intensity , the number of sources in each absorption class has to be increased by 20% .",
    "the predicted 510 kev counts are reported in fig .",
    "[ sns_l44 ] and compared with the observational data and with the baseline model .",
    "it is clear that with such a model the hellas counts at relatively bright fluxes are severely underestimated since most of the xrb energy density is due to low luminosity agn emerging only at lower fluxes ( comastri 2000 ) .",
    "to evaluate the absorbing column density of the hellas sources from the x - ray count ratio , the redshift of the source should be known ( assuming that the absorber is at the same redshift of the source , see fiore et al .",
    "1998 ) . to this purpose",

    "substantial absorbing column densities are implied .",
    "not surprisingly , almost all the sources in the nearby universe ( @xmath39 0.3 ) , which are likely to be obscured by column densities @xmath40 cm@xmath2 , are narrow line , type 1.8 - 2 agn ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; la franca et al . 2001 ) , while broad line agn are relatively unabsorbed in agreement with popular agn unification schemes .",
    "the situation is different at high redshift where several broad  line agn appear to have strongly absorbed x  ray spectra .",
    "the statistics in the present observations are not good enough to definitely assess this point . xmm_newton",
    "_ observations may easily confirm or disprove a significant absorbing column in these sources .",
    "the presence of highly x  ray obscured quasars with broad optical lines implies a dust  to  gas ratio or a dust composition strongly different from the galactic one ( maiolino et al .",

    "this radius depends on the central source luminosity and thus if the x ",
