    "modern cosmology has confronted the physics community with a number of unexplained observations , such as the accelerating expansion of the universe and the isotropy of the cosmological microwave background .",
    "the standard model of cosmology aims to explain these observations by the presence of dark energy in the @xmath0cdm model and an inflationary phase in the early universe .",
    "however , the mechanisms behind these explanations , i.e. , the constituents of dark energy and the driving force of the inflation , are not yet understood .",
    "this opens the possibility to create various models both from particle physics and gravity theory .",
    "the model we discuss here belongs to the gravitational category .",
    "the basic idea of this model is to replace the metric geometry of spacetime from general relativity by a finsler length measure . in this article",
    "we derive a theory of fluid dynamics based on this finsler geometric background .",
    "the work we present in this article has two main ingredients .",
    "the first ingredient , which serves as the background geometry , is the finsler spacetime framework.@xcite this framework introduces a notion of finsler geometry which provides a unified description of a lorentzian causality , observers and gravity , and which can be used as a background for field theories such as electrodynamics .",
    "the second ingredient is the kinetic theory of fluids.@xcite this theory is based on the idea that fluids can be modeled as being constituted by particles , whose worldlines are geodesics on the background spacetime . in the continuum limit this theory yields equations of motion for a density function on a subspace of the tangent bundle of spacetime . in this article",
    "we generalize this kinetic theory of fluids to finsler spacetimes . in this model",
    "the density function becomes a function on observer space,@xcite which is the space of physically allowed four - velocities .",
    "we apply this formalism to two physically motivated examples .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec : finsler ] we provide a brief introduction to the geometry of finsler spacetimes . from this starting point",
    "we construct the space of physical observer velocities in section  [ sec : observer ] and discuss its geometric structure .",
    "we then use this structure to construct a model of fluid dynamics based on kinetic theory in section  [ sec : fluids ] . in section",
    "[ sec : special ] we apply this model to two particular examples : a collisionless dust fluid and a fluid with cosmological symmetry .",
    "we end with a conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we start our discussion with a brief review of the background geometry . in this section",
    "we introduce the basic geometric objects on a finsler spacetime , which will later be used for the construction of fluid dynamics .",
    "our starting point is the following definition:@xcite    a _ finsler spacetime _",
    "@xmath1 is a four - dimensional , connected , hausdorff , paracompact , smooth manifold @xmath2 equipped with continuous real functions @xmath3 on the tangent bundle @xmath4 which has the following properties :    1 .",
    "[ finsler : lsmooth ] @xmath5 is smooth on the tangent bundle without the zero section @xmath6 .",
    "[ finsler : lhomogeneous ] @xmath5 is positively homogeneous of real degree @xmath7 with respect to the fiber coordinates of  @xmath4 , @xmath8 and defines the finsler function @xmath9 via @xmath10 .",
    "[ finsler : lreversible ] @xmath5 is reversible : @xmath11 .",
    "[ finsler : lhessian ] the hessian @xmath12 of @xmath5 with respect to the fiber coordinates is non - degenerate on @xmath13 , where @xmath14 has measure zero and does not contain the null set @xmath15 .",
    "[ finsler : timelike ] the unit timelike condition holds , i.e. , for all @xmath16 the set @xmath17 contains a non - empty closed connected component @xmath18 .",
    "here we have used coordinates @xmath19 on @xmath2 and the _ induced coordinates _",
    "@xmath20 on @xmath4 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the finsler function @xmath9 introduced above defines a length functional @xmath22 = \\int d\\tau\\,f(\\gamma(\\tau),\\dot{\\gamma}(\\tau))\\,,\\ ] ] which measures the length of a curve @xmath23 on @xmath2 .",
    "an important class of curves called _ finsler geodesics _ are those for which the length functional becomes extremal .",
    "they satisfy the geodesic equation @xmath24 here we have introduced the _",
    "cartan non - linear connection _",
    "@xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the inverse of the _ finsler metric _",
    "@xmath29 the cartan non - linear connection induces a unique split of the tangent bundle @xmath30 into horizontal and vertical parts , @xmath31 .",
    "the horizontal tangent bundle @xmath32 is spanned by the vector fields @xmath33 while the vertical tangent bundle @xmath34 is spanned by @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding basis @xmath36 that respects this split is called the _ berwald basis_. its dual basis of @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 using the berwald basis we can find another description for finsler geodesics . for this purpose",
    "we consider the canonical lift @xmath39 of a geodesic @xmath40 to the tangent bundle @xmath4 .",
    "writing @xmath41 in coordinates @xmath42 we find the geodesic equation @xmath43 since this is a first order differential equation , the canonical lifts of finsler geodesics take the form of integral curves of a vector field @xmath44 on @xmath4 , which we call the _",
    "geodesic spray_. finally , the berwald basis and the finsler metric allow the construction of a metric @xmath45 on the tangent bundle , which is called the _",
    "after discussing the most important finsler geometric structures on the tangent bundle @xmath4 in the previous section we now restrict ourselves to a particular subspace of @xmath4 .",
    "recall from the definition of a finsler spacetime that for each @xmath16 there exists a shell @xmath46 of future unit timelike vectors , which corresponds to the four - velocities of test masses and physical observers .",
    "their union @xmath47 is called _",
    "observer space_. this is the space on which we will define fluid dynamics in the remainder of this work .    the observer space is a seven - dimensional submanifold of the tangent bundle @xmath4 and thus inherits a number of geometric structures from the finsler geometry .",
    "in particular , the geodesic spray @xmath48 introduced in the previous section is tangent to the observer space , and thus restricts to a vector field @xmath49 on @xmath50 , called the _ reeb vector field_. this relation between the geodesic spray and the observer space is in fact necessary for the interpretation of @xmath50 as the space of physical four - velocities : it means that a test mass possessing a physical initial four - velocity and following a geodesic , and thus an integral curve of @xmath48 , will have a physical four - velocity at all times .",
    "the canonical lifts of all physical geodesics , corresponding to freely falling test masses , are thus given by integral curves of the reeb vector field @xmath49 on @xmath50 .",
    "the second important structure on the observer space is the restriction @xmath51 of the sasaki metric @xmath52 to @xmath50 .",
    "this also equips @xmath50 with a volume form @xmath53 .",
    "this volume form has a number of properties which are relevant for the construction of a theory of fluid dynamics .",
    "the most relevant property for the remainder of this article is the fact that it is preserved by the flow of the reeb vector field , @xmath54 .    from the reeb vector field @xmath49 and the volume form @xmath55",
    "we finally define the _ particle measure _ @xmath56 .",
    "it is the unique six - form ( up to a constant factor ) which has the following properties necessary for the construction of fluid dynamics from the kinetic theory .",
    "most importantly , its restriction to a hypersurface @xmath57 which is not tangent to the reeb vector field @xmath49 is a non - vanishing volume form on @xmath58 .",
    "further , it is closed , @xmath59 , and preserved by the flow of the reeb vector field , @xmath60 .",
    "the relevance of these properties will become clear in the following section , when we use it as an ingredient to develop a theory of fluid dynamics .",
    "we now turn our attention to the kinetic theory of fluids@xcite and apply it to fluids on the finsler spacetime background geometry detailed in the preceding section . for this purpose",
    "we first briefly review how fluids can be modeled by the geodesic motion of particles . from the geodesic motion on finsler spacetimes",
    "we then derive the equations of motion for a finsler fluid .",
    "the basic idea of the kinetic theory of fluids is the assumption that fluids are constituted by particles . in the simplest possible case of a single component fluid , which we will discuss here ,",
    "all particles have identical properties , such as mass and electric charge , and follow piecewise geodesic curves .",
    "this geodesic motion corresponds to the motion of freely falling test masses without any other interaction .",
    "the interaction between particles is modeled by collisions , which mark the endpoints of the geodesic pieces of the particle trajectories and correspond to instantaneous transfers of momentum between the particles .",
    "the physical background of this model of interactions is the assumption that the interaction distances are small compared to the distances between the particles and that the interaction times are short compared to the time between interactions , which is the case for a sufficiently low density .    in order to construct a continuum theory of fluids from the particle model one",
    "introduces the one - particle distribution function @xmath61 such that for each oriented hypersurface @xmath57 the integral @xmath62 = \\int_{\\sigma}\\phi\\omega\\ ] ] is the number @xmath63 $ ] of particle trajectories whose canonical lifts to @xmath50 pass through @xmath58 . here",
    "particle trajectories @xmath40 are counted positively ( negatively ) if the tangent vector of their canonical lift and a positively oriented basis of the tangent space to @xmath58 at the intersection point between @xmath40 and @xmath58 form a positively ( negatively ) oriented basis of the tangent space of @xmath50 at that point .",
    "further , @xmath64 denotes the particle measure introduced in the previous section .",
    "we now take a closer look at the canonical lifts of the particle trajectories to the observer space .",
    "it follows from our assumption of instantaneous momentum transfer that these lifts are discontinuous at collisions , i.e. , they have endpoints corresponding to the particles velocities before and after the collision . to incorporate collisions into the continuum theory we define the collision transfer density @xmath65 such that for each hypervolume @xmath66 the integral @xmath67 = \\int_v\\dot{\\phi}\\sigma\\ ] ] is the number of initial points minus the number of final points of canonical lifts of particle trajectories in @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes the volume form of the sasaki metric @xmath51 on @xmath50 .",
    "note that we have defined the counting prescription for curves passing a hypersurface such that any curve which has an initial point , but no final point in the hypervolume @xmath68 passes its boundary @xmath69 in the positive direction , and in the negative direction in the opposite case .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath70 = n[\\partial v]$ ] . from this",
    "we further find that @xmath71 = n[\\partial v ] = \\int_{\\partial v}\\phi\\omega = \\int_vd(\\phi\\omega ) = \\int_v(\\mathcal{l}_{\\mathbf{r}}\\phi)\\sigma\\,,\\ ] ] where we used stokes theorem and the properties of the particle measure @xmath64 .",
    "since this holds for any hypervolume @xmath68 it follows that @xmath72 the right hand side of this equation describes the evolution of @xmath73 .",
    "we thus obtain the equation of motion of the fluid by specifying a functional @xmath74 $ ] describing collisions between particles . for the simplest possible case of a collisionless fluid we have @xmath75 , and the fluid equation of motion",
    "reduces to the liouville equation @xmath76 .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the kinetic theory of fluids in general . in the following section we will discuss particular examples of fluids and derive their equations of motion",
    "after discussing general fluids on finsler spacetimes in the previous section , we now consider a few special cases .",
    "the first case we display in section  [ subsec : dust ] is dust , which is conventionally described as a collisionless perfect fluid with vanishing pressure . starting from the liouville equation",
    "we derive the generalization of the euler equations to dust on finsler spacetimes . the second case shown in section  [ subsec : cosmology ]",
    "is the most general cosmological fluid .",
    "we start from a general finsler spacetime with cosmological symmetry and derive the equations of motion for the most general fluid obeying the same symmetry .",
    "the first example we discuss is a collisionless dust fluid characterized by a matter density @xmath77 and four - velocity distribution @xmath78 , which is a future timelike vector field normalized by the finsler function , and thus a function @xmath79 .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive the equations of motion for @xmath80 and @xmath81 from the kinetic theory introduced in the preceding section . for this purpose",
    "we will first construct the one - particle distribution function @xmath73 and then impose the liouville equation @xmath76 for a collisionless fluid .",
    "we start by introducing coordinates @xmath82 on @xmath50 and writing the three - velocity as @xmath83 .",
    "together with the proper dirac delta distribution on the unit timelike shell @xmath84 we find the one - particle distribution function @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the determinant of the restriction @xmath87 of the sasaki metric to @xmath84 . a direct calculation of the lie derivative @xmath88",
    "is obstructed by the presence of the delta distribution .",
    "we therefore introduce an arbitrary smooth test function @xmath89 . using the properties of the particle measure @xmath64 and integrating by parts",
    "we then find @xmath90 writing the finsler function in the form @xmath91 we obtain the reeb vector field @xmath92,\\ ] ] using the partial derivatives @xmath93 and @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and the volume form @xmath97 finally inserting the explicit form for @xmath73 we arrive at @xmath98f\\,.\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath99 cancels the dirac distribution and yields @xmath100\\right|_{y^a = u^a(\\hat{x})}\\,,\\ ] ] where it is indicated that all objects on observer space are taken at the point @xmath101 .",
    "observe that the partial derivative @xmath102 is fixed by @xmath103 and thus not an independent quantity , while @xmath104 depends on the choice of @xmath105 in a neighborhood of @xmath106 , which can be chosen independently .",
    "we therefore need to eliminate @xmath107 using integration by parts .",
    "since @xmath93 is only a partial derivative , but @xmath103 contains also an implicit dependence on @xmath108 via @xmath106 , we first need to rewrite the partial derivative into a total derivative using @xmath109 integration by parts and using the normalization @xmath110 then finally yields @xmath111\\rho\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\alpha}f\\\\ - \\left[\\hat{\\partial}_a(\\rho u^a ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^ag^{f\\,bc}\\left(\\hat{\\partial}_ag^f_{bc } + \\hat{\\partial}_au^d\\bar{\\partial}_dg^f_{bc}\\right)\\right]f\\bigg\\}\\bigg|_{y^a = u^a(\\hat{x})}\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since now all spacetime derivatives act on objects which depend only on spacetime coordinates , we can rename the coordinates @xmath95 back to @xmath112 and read off the equations of motion @xmath113 and @xmath114 these equations can further be simplified . using the properties of the cartan non - linear connection we can rewrite the first equation   in the form @xmath115 where we have introduced the dynamical covariant derivative @xmath116 . similarly , the second equation   can be written as @xmath117 where we have introduced the covariant derivative @xmath118 of the cartan linear connection . in the case of a metric finsler function @xmath119",
    "these equations reduce to the well - known euler equations @xmath120 for a pressureless fluid .      as the final example we will derive the liouville equation for a fluid with cosmological symmetry . for this purpose",
    "we introduce coordinates @xmath121 on the spacetime manifold @xmath2 and the corresponding induced coordinates @xmath122 on @xmath4 . in these coordinates the cosmological symmetry generators take the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 determines the spatial curvature of the corresponding spacetime . for",
    "cosmologically symmetric fluid dynamics we require that both the background geometry and the one - particle distribution function of the fluid obey this symmetry .",
    "we start by deriving the most general cosmologically symmetric background geometry .",
    "a finsler spacetime is symmetric under the action of a vector field @xmath125 if and only if the geometry function @xmath5 , and thus also the finsler function @xmath9 , is invariant under the complete lift of @xmath125 to the tangent bundle,@xcite @xmath126 in the present case of a cosmological symmetry it is most convenient to introduce new coordinates on @xmath4 via the definition @xmath127 after calculating the complete lifts of the vector fields   in these coordinates it turns out that the most general finsler function with cosmological symmetry is given by @xmath128 .",
    "further , from the fact that @xmath9 is 1-homogeneous in the coordinates @xmath129 and @xmath130 follows that it must be of the form @xmath131 for the discussion of geodesic motion it is convenient to introduce yet another set of coordinates on @xmath4 as @xmath132 in these coordinates the observer space @xmath50 is given as a connected component of the submanifold @xmath133 , so that one can use the remaining seven coordinates to parametrize @xmath50 .",
    "the reeb vector field then takes the form @xmath134 where the subscripts @xmath135 and @xmath136 indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "we finally come to the discussion of fluids on the finsler spacetime background derived above . since the background geometry obeys the cosmological symmetry defined by the vector fields  , their canonical lifts are tangent to the observer space @xmath50 .",
    "a fluid obeys the same symmetry if and only if its one - particle distribution function @xmath73 is invariant under the restriction of these canonical lifts to @xmath50 . in the present case the most general one - particle distribution function satisfying",
    "this condition takes the form @xmath139 .",
    "its lie derivative with respect to the reeb vector field is thus given by @xmath140 for the simplest possible case of a collisionless fluid the equation of motion hence takes the form @xmath141 this is the liouville equation for a fluid with cosmological symmetry .",
    "we have derived a model for fluid dynamics on finsler geometric backgrounds based on the kinetic theory of fluids and applied our model to two important special cases .",
    "our results show that finsler spacetimes provide a suitable background geometry for fluid dynamics and that the obtained fluid equations of motion reduce to their well - known limits if the background geometry is metric .",
    "of course any model of fluid dynamics must be complemented by a suitable model of gravitational dynamics in order to derive consistent solutions . for the finsler",
    "spacetimes we used here an extension of general relativity exists.@xcite the source of the gravitational field in this model is a scalar function on the tangent bundle of spacetime . deriving this energy - momentum scalar for",
