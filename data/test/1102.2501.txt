    "the idea that our universe is a brane living in a higher dimensional space has attracted considerable attention during the recent decade @xcite .",
    "the physical properties on such a brane must automatically be induced from the surrounding space known as bulk through some well - established junction rules .",
    "one such particular example of brane - bulk pair is provided when the brane has dimension one - less ( @xmath0 ) in a @xmath1dimensional bulk known as domain wall ( dw ) with the @xmath2 symmetry across . beside the universe concept ,",
    "the dw entails topological defect formations pertaining to the remnants from the big bang , different vacua of quantum fields and other applications of vital importance . as emphasized often ,",
    "one of the most important problems in modern cosmology is the accelerated expansion of our currently observed universe , its causes and whether it will do so indefinitely .",
    "can the answer be obtained from the idea of dws assumed that our universe is a dw in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime ?",
    "in other words , can we construct an appropriate bulk spacetime so that inflation driven by matter on the dw is induced from it ?",
    "it must be admitted that a bulk with such generality is still missing . herein we choose our bulk metric to be @xmath3dimensional ( @xmath4 ) while the dw becomes @xmath5dimensional ( @xmath6 ) which may be considered in this regard as a toy model .",
    "let us not forget , however , that lower dimensional physics may serve to shed light on higher dimensions .",
    "one justifiable reason for choosing our bulk as @xmath7 is that we can provide an exact solution with quite generality to encompass new dynamics on the dw and serve our purpose well .",
    "the action contains maxwell and dilaton fields beside gravity whose coupling is non - minimal @xcite . with this much rich action ,",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to obtain exact solution in bulk dimension @xmath8 for this reason we are satisfied with @xmath9 in addition , we have an extra liouville type potential of the dilaton @xcite and our maxwell field is pure magnetic . due to the fact that the coupling to dilaton is rather complicated ,",
    "solution becomes possible , with a pure magnetic field .",
    "depending on the choice of integration constants and dilatonic parameter we have obtained a large class of non - asymptotically magnetic solutions that yield previously known solutions of its kind in particular limits @xcite .",
    "pure electrically charged solutions @xcite , on the other hand are not expected to overlap with our magnetic ones .",
    "one crucial difference between those and the present work is in the coupling between dilaton and the magnetic field .",
    "essentially it is this difference that provides a richer dynamical structure on the dw without reference to non - physical conditions such as negative mass .",
    "it should also be added that we consider a neutral brane ( dw ) so that by @xmath2 symmetry , continuity of the vector potential and electromagnetic field across the brane the maxwell equations are trivially satisfied . in other words the surface ( dw ) lagrangian does nt depend on the electromagnetic field , it depends explicitly only on the dilaton whose boundary conditions are accounted for in the junction conditions .",
    "this amounts to the fact that the tension / energy density on the brane are only those induced from the energy and dilaton in the bulk .",
    "the effect of the maxwell fields manifests itself on the brane through the magnetic charge .",
    "our dw universe is a @xmath5dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with a single metric function ( = the radius of the universe ) depending on its proper time @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions that connect bulk to the dw are provided by the darmoise - israel conditions @xcite apt for the problem .",
    "these conditions determine the energy - momentum on the dw universe together with its dynamics .",
    "an interesting aspect of the solution that we present in this paper is that on the dw our frw universe attains both lower and upper bounces .",
    "this particular point provides our main motivation for this study .",
    "it happens that the occurrence of the double liouville type potentials in our model made this possible for us . from the boundary conditions",
    "the induced potential on the dw the radius @xmath10 of the dw universe satisfies an equation of a particle with zero total energy ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "such a motion is physical only provided the potential @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 , for all @xmath14 .",
    "this is investigated thoroughly and we observed that our dw universe admits both minimum and maximum bounces . among other things absence of a dw universe ( i.e. @xmath15 ) is also a possibility .    in section",
    "ii we present our model lagrangian and obtain a general class of solutions to it . in section iii",
    "we analyze the induced potential on the dw .",
    "conclusion makes our last section iv which summarizes our results .",
    "our action of einstein - maxwell dilaton ( emd ) gravity is written as 4,5,6,9,10 @xmath16where @xmath17 is the maxwell invariant@xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the dilaton scalar potential .",
    "herein @xmath21 and @xmath22 are some constants to be identified later while @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the induced potential on the dw .",
    "@xmath25 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath26 of dw with the induced metric @xmath27 ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) .",
    "( latin indices run over the dw coordinates while greek indices refer to the bulk s coordinates .",
    "also in the sequel we use units in which @xmath30 ) .",
    "the @xmath3dimensional bulk metric is chosen to be @xmath31where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are functions to be found and @xmath34 is the line element on a @xmath35dimensional space of constant curvature with @xmath36 i.e. , @xmath37    the field equations inside the bulk follow from the variational principles as@xmath38 in which @xmath39is the energy momentum tensor of our maxwell 2-form @xmath40 . variation with respect to the gauge potential @xmath41form @xmath42 yields the maxwell equation    @xmath43    in which @xmath44 is the exterior derivative and the hodge star @xmath45 means duality . as we commented before , @xmath46 is a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is double liouville function .",
    "this means that although an electric field ansatz that makes the maxwell equation complicated enough for an exact solution , a pure magnetic ansatz easily satisfies the maxwell equation .",
    "therefore we prefer to use a magnetic potential @xmath41form with magnetic charge @xmath49 which reads as ( this is also another feature of our work in comparison with maity s work in ref .",
