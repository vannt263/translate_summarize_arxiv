    "understanding of the mechanisms leading to the glass transition has been a subject of intense research in recent years and it is still a matter of numerous theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question particularly concerns the microscopic description of the precusor cooperative mechanisms which develop in the high temperatures pico - nanosecond regime ( ps - ns ) far above the glass transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it is now commonly suspected , mainly from theoretical and numerical results , that dynamical behaviours of glass - forming systems could be described by involving two characteristic temperatures  @xcite : i ) @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 are also seen ) corresponding to the onset of slow dynamics where non - exponential relaxation and non - arrhenius behavior emerge  @xcite .",
    "first appearance of rotational heterogeneity are also reported  @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath3 in the vitrication process is still not completely understood but it is often considered as the temperature below which dynamics are influenced by the potential energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "ii ) @xmath0 , the critical temperature predicted by the mode coupling theory mct  @xcite . in the last two decades , enormous work has been devoted to this theory and it is so far the only one which provides a microscopic description of simple liquids .",
    "the intrinsic basis of mct states that the behaviour of any time - dependent correlators describing the dynamics of the system is only controlled by its static density correlator _ i.e _ @xmath6 and predicts the existence of a critical temperature @xmath0 indicating a bifurcation from ergodic to non - ergodic dynamics .",
    "the role of @xmath6 and the scaling properties predicted by mct approaching @xmath0 have been successfully validated in numerous experiments and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , no sharp transition is observed at @xmath0 itself owing some activated processes not included in the theory which restores ergodicity .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is also associated to a dynamical crossover to a landscape - dominated regime in which diffusion processes can be described in terms of thermally activated jumps .",
    "most of the glassformers are molecular liquids and accordingly possess both translational and rotational degrees of freedom ( tdof and odof ) . approaching the glass transtion ,",
    "the coupling between tdof and odof is far from being understood and the precise role of the odof remains unclear as demonstrated by the so - called low - temperature translation - rotation paradox  @xcite .",
    "mct has been initially developped to provide a microscopic understanding of simple atomic liquids .",
    "however , general predictions have also been successfully validated for molecular compounds .",
    "recently , some extensions of mct called molecular mode coupling theory ( mmct )  @xcite have been proposed to take odof into account : one diatomic probe molecule in an atomic liquid  @xcite , liquids made of linear molecules  @xcite or water  @xcite to cite only a few .",
    "the authors have particularly shown that some of the basic predictions of mct still hold owing tdof / odof coupling .",
    "as revealed by recent md investigations  @xcite performed on orthoterphenyl ( otp ) , coupling of the rotational dynamics to the center - of - mass motion can be complex .",
    "an alternative to the glassforming molecular liquids is offered by at least two partially disordered systems which provide an interesting solution in order to investigate only odof during the freezing process :    \\i ) the so - called _ orientational glasses _ such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 mixed crystal where rotational motions are frustated by a quenched disorder externally imposed by a dilution  @xcite k.  h.  michel and coworkers  @xcite developped a mct for these systems which involved the interplay or rotational - translational and rotational - strains coupling where strains result from the substitutional disorder .",
    "\\ii ) _ glassy crystals _",
    "@xcite such as cyanoadamantane  @xcite , ethanol  @xcite , orthocarborane  @xcite or cyclooctanol  @xcite which are true rotational analogs of canonical liquid glassformers .",
    "these systems are generally composed of globular molecules and exhibit a partially disordered phase , called plastic , which possesses a crystalline translational order and a dynamical orientational disorder .",
    "they can be rapidly cooled from the plastic phase and exhibit a step of the specific heat at the calorimetric temperature @xmath2 or a non - arrhenius behavior of the rotational relaxation times .",
    "no microscopic theory has been developped for plastic crystals so far .",
    "however , in  @xcite , we have particularly shown from nmr and raman experiments , and md computer simulations that some predictions of the idealized version of the mct ( critical temperature @xmath0 and time scaling laws ) were able to describe relatively well rotational dynamics of different plastic crystals .",
    "it should be noted that the other remarkable temperature @xmath3 was also identified .",
    "these intriguing previous results call for new investigations to clarify the similarity between slow dynamics behaviour of plastic crystals and molecular liquids and in particular to discuss the role of the static correlations @xmath6 . in this paper , we present for the first time results of neutron spin - echo ( nse ) and x - ray experiments and md simulations of the glassy crystal difluorotetrachloroethane ( dftce ) .",
    "this compound is composed of simple molecules @xmath9 close to dumbbells extensively used in md calculations as prototype of molecular glass - formers liquids  @xcite .",
    "dftce has been experimentally widely studied and presents a rich variety of unusual properties .",
    "dftce exhibits a glass transition of the overall rotation of the molecules at @xmath10 k  @xcite .",
    "two additional heat anomalies are found at 60 and 130 k and associated respectively to a sub-@xmath2 @xmath11 process and the freezing of the transformation between _ trans _ and _ gauche _ conformation of the molecule .",
    "changes concerning the nature of dynamics in this system has been reported from nmr experiments  @xcite , brillouin and dielectric spectroscopy  @xcite . in this latter investigation ,",
    "a crossover from individual to correlated rotational motions was particularly suggested .",
    "the samples used in both x - ray and nse experiments consist of commercial 1,2-difluorotetrachloroethane purchased from sigma - aldrich and purified by melting zone .",
    "the x - ray diffraction experiment was performed on a laboratory diffractometer equipped with an inel curved sensitive detector cps 120 made up of 4096 channels and allowing us to record simultaneously x - ray diffraction on a @xmath12 range of about 120 deg .",
    "the incident beam was monochromatized with a bent of quartz crystal which selects the @xmath13 wavelength of a cu x - ray tube ( @xmath14  ) .",
    "powder dftce was introduced in lindemann glass capillary of 0.5 mm in diameter .",
    "it was mounted on the axis of the diffractometer and rotated during the experiment in order to reduce the effect of preferential orientation .",
    "the correspondence between the channel number and the @xmath15 angle was determined by a preliminary x - ray experiment of cubic @xmath16 ( nac )  @xcite with a cubic spline interpolation between the bragg peaks of nac .",
    "low temperatures were achieved by placing the sample into a gaseous nitrogen flow at the required temperature . using this procedure ,",
    "the sample is quenched within a few seconds , and its temperature can be controlled within 0.5 k between 110 k and 300 k. in the present experiment , the x - ray pattern was recorded at 140 k during 3600 s for a sample quenched at 2k / min .",
    "the nse experiments were performed on the in11 spectrometer at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) , grenoble , france .",
    "we used the multidetector version of in11 which allows simultaneous measurements at different scattering angles .",
    "a setup with an incident wavelength of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 % ) gave access to wave numbers approximately between 1.28 and @xmath19 and we covered the time range 8 ps - 1 ns . we made measurements of the coherent signal of poly - crystalline systems filled into a flat al container from @xmath20 130 to 220 k in steps of 10 k. for normalization , a resolution scan of the elastic scattering was realized at @xmath21 k in the glassy phase and all data were divided by the polarization at this temperature .",
    "two samples of different mass identified as a ( @xmath22 g ) and b ( @xmath23 g ) were investigated .",
    "although preliminary measurements showed that transmission of sample a was better , 93% to be compared to 77% obtained for sample b , this latter was prefered for most of the measurements since its scattering signal was more intense . unfortunately",
    ", only data obtained from sample a are available at @xmath20 130 and 140 k.    md calculations were performed on a system of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 bcc crystalline cells ) molecules .",
    "each dftce molecule @xmath9 is described by its 8 atoms and considered as a rigid unit .",
    "they interact through a buckingham short range atom - atom potential ( see parameters in table  [ table1 ] ) and the electrostatic contributions have been neglected since the dftce molecule possesses a weak dipolar moment . no structural or dynamical change has been found for a system where electrostatic interactions are taken into account .",
    "it should be noted that both structure and dynamics were found in good agreement with experimental results ( see figures  [ figure1 ] and  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "newton s equations of motion were solved with a time step of @xmath26 fs .",
    "we worked in the npt statistical ensemble with periodic boundaries conditions where the simulation box is allowed to change in size and shape .",
    "md simulations were done for a sample corresponding to the dftce orientationally disordered phase at 14 different temperatures from @xmath27 130 to 260 k in steps of 10 k. it should be mentioned that our very simple dftce model allows us to perform very long md runs of about 50 ns .    in this paper , single - molecule reorientational dynamics of dftce will be obtained from the first two self angular correlation functions @xmath28  @xcite defined as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31-order legendre polynomial and @xmath32 is a unit vector directed along the @xmath33-symmetry carbon - carbon molecular axis of the dftce molecule @xmath34 ( see fig .",

    ", we can obtain clarification on the nature of dynamical changes and anisotropy of the molecular motions .",
    "experimentally , @xmath35 can be directly measured in dielectric relaxation and @xmath36 in raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 can also be related to the informations obtained from nmr relaxation measurements  @xcite .    in order to investigate collective dynamics , the intermediate scattering function as it can be classically obtained from coherent neutron scattering experiments",

    "an average over isotropically distributed @xmath42-vectors having the same modulus @xmath42 is performed in order to obtain @xmath43 for a polycrystalline sample . in general , @xmath43 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coherent elastic scattering and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fluctuation of the time - dependent density operator . for plastic crystals , @xmath43 is identical to @xmath48 except for @xmath42-vectors corresponding to bragg peaks for which the long time limit of @xmath43 reaches the non - zero value @xmath49 .",
    "this behaviour is found at all temperatures and it is associated to the crystalline order of the tdof and not the freezing process of the odof . similarly to the intermediate scattering function , the static correlator can be decomposed into two components @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the diffuse scattering : @xmath52",
    "owing the high rotational disorder , plastics crystals yield only a few diffraction peaks but exhibit intense and highly structured diffusive scattering which provides useful information to characterize rotational motions and most probable orientations  @xcite .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows both numerical and experimental static structure factors obtained in the @xmath42-range @xmath53 $ ] @xmath54 .",
    "the diffraction pattern of the plastic phase presents eight bragg peaks localized at 1.272 , 1.799 , 2.203 , 2.543 , 2.844 , 3.114 , 3.596 and 3.816 @xmath54 which are well indexed as a bcc structure having a cell parameter of 6.985 @xmath54 .",
    "the cell parameter is found 2% smaller from md simulation .",
    "this result confirms the preliminary x - ray diffraction investigation of this crystal performed by kishimoto  _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "the elastic and the diffuse scattering have been extracted from the md study and are found in good agreement with the x - ray experiment : maxima of @xmath49 coincide with the position of the experimental bragg peaks and maxima of @xmath51 with the broad bumps of the diffuse scattering at @xmath55 1.3 , 2.34 , 3.36 and 4.8 @xmath54 .",
    "it should be mentionned that an additional diffuse scattering bump is observed experimentally close to @xmath56 @xmath54 .",
    "this feature which is also present in the pattern of the liquid phase ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] ) mainly derives from the scattering contribtuon of the glass capillary sample holder .",
    "moreover , a strong similartiy of the x - ray pattern is observed between the liquid and plastic phase .",
    "such remarkable feature has been already reported for ethanol  @xcite or @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the first sharp diffraction peak of the liquid particularly corresponds to the first and most intense bragg peak of the plastic phase .",
    "broad bumps of the diffuse scattering are found almost identical in both phases and merge at the largest @xmath42-vectors since the same intramolecular structure is probed .",
    "this result could suggest a strong analogy between the supercooled liquid and the supercooled plastic crystal of the same compound in the framework of the mct which predict that dynamics are controlled by non trivial static correlations .",
    "this question will be adressed in an other paper  @xcite .",
    "the orientational distribution of the dftce molecules can be described with the probability distribution function @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a unit vector along the carbon - carbon molecular axis of dftce ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . since the site symmetry of the crytal is @xmath60 , @xmath58 may be expanded as a series of cubic harmonics @xmath61  @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 have been calculated from md simulations at different temperatures and are reported in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "this table clearly shows no strong ordering of the dftce molecules along the prefered [ 111 ] , [ 110 ] or [ 100 ] directions of the cubic lattice consistent with the high rotational disorder of plastic phases .",
    "however , a slight preference for [ 111 ] directions is observed . upon lowering the temperature",
    ", we also found an increase of the orientational probability along [ 111 ] unlikely to [ 110 ] or [ 100 ] .",
    "these results have been also confirmed from different snapshots of individual molecule trajectories as displayed in fig  [ figure_snap ] .",

    "figure  [ figure_snap ] shows @xmath36 time correlation functions for all investigated temperatures from 130 k to 260 k. @xmath35 time correlation functions , not displayed in the present paper , shows a very similar behaviour to the @xmath36 functions . at high temperatures",
    ", @xmath36 rapidly decays zero and can be described by a simple exponential shape .",
    "when lowering the temperature , dynamics slow down and a two - step process is seen as already observed in chloroadamantane plastic crystals  @xcite and in supercooled liquids  @xcite .",

    "this result is also confirmed from snapshots of single - molecule trajectories in fig .",
    "[ figure_snap ] .",
    "thus , low temperature rotational dynamics can be seen as tumblings between prefered orientations along [ 111 ] directions of the cubic cell .",

    "a perfect agreement can not be expected owing the @xmath42-dependence of the neutron scattering technique and the different temperature domain investigated .    in  @xcite",

    "we show that the curves overlap for the large time part and collapse gradually onto a master curve upon cooling .",
    "this feature is made particularly clear since we have developed a realistic md model of dftce which allows us to access data in the plateau region of @xmath43 which was not possible in the present nse experiment . at @xmath20130",

    "i.e _ the so - called hopping processes not taken into account in the ideal version of mct ( see section  [ static ] ) .",
    "moreover , this deviation also allows us to roughly estimate the critical temperature @xmath0 .    above @xmath0",
    ", mct predicts that the late @xmath11 regime or the early @xmath1 relaxation is described by the following power law ( going beyond first order ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the so - called nonergodicity parameter associated to the plateau height and @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",

    "<S> complementary neutron spin echo and x - ray experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on difluorotetrachloroethane ( cfcl2-cfcl2 ) glassy crystal . </S>",
    "<S> static , single - molecule reorientational dynamics and collective dynamics properties are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the orientational disorder is characterized at different temperatures and a change in nature of rotational dynamics is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that dynamics can be described by some scaling predictions of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) and a critical temperature @xmath0 is determined . </S>",
    "<S> our results also confirm the strong analogy between molecular liquids and plastic crystals for which @xmath1-relaxation times and non - ergodicity parameters are controlled by the non trivial static correlations as predicted by mct . </S>"
