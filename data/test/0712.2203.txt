    "the spectral lines of the multiplet of neutral helium at 10830   are of great diagnostic value for investigating the dynamic and magnetic properties of plasma structures in the solar chromosphere and corona .",
    "this is because their polarization is sensitive to the presence of atomic level polarization and to the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects ( e.g. trujillo bueno & asensio ramos , 2007 ) , which makes these lines especially sensitive to the strongest fields found in solar active regions ( e.g. , harvey & hall 1977 ; redi et al . 1995 ; centeno et al .",
    "2006 ) and also to the weaker fields encountered in a variety of plasma structures such as filaments ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1998 ; trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2002 ) , regions of emerging magnetic flux ( e.g. , lagg et al . 2004 ) , chromospheric spicules ( e.g. , trujillo bueno et al . 2005 ; socas - navarro et al . 2005 ) and prominences ( e.g. , merenda et al .",
    "obviously , in order to be able to obtain reliable inferences from the observed spectral line radiation it is necessary to reach a rigorous physical understanding of the key mechanisms that are responsible for its intensity and polarization .",
    "the same applies to the lines of the he i d@xmath0 multiplet at 5876  whose observed polarization has been used for investigating the magnetic field vector in solar prominences and spicules ( e.g. , landi deglinnocenti 1982 ; leroy , bommier & sahal - brchot , 1983 ; casini et al . 2003 ; lpez ariste & casini 2005 ; bianda et al .",
    "2006 ; ramelli et al .",
    "2006 a , b ) .",
    "while the modeling of the spectral line intensity has been done by solving the standard non - lte radiation transfer problem in one - dimensional ( 1-d ) semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere ( e.g. , pozhalova 1988 ; avrett et al . 1994 ; andretta & jones 1997 ) , the physical interpretation of the observed spectral line polarization has been carried out taking into account the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects within the framework of the quantum theory of polarization , but simplifying the radiative transfer problem by using the optically thin approximation ( e.g. , landi deglinnocenti , 1982 ; leroy et al , 1983 ; casini et al 2004 ) or by solving the stokes - vector transfer equation in a slab of constant physical properties ( trujillo bueno et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) .    in this slab model for the interpretation of polarization observations , the slab s optical thickness is simply chosen as a free parameter to fit the observed intensity profile .",
    "this  cloud \" model for the interpretation of polarization observations simplifies the forward modeling and inversion problem ( see trujillo bueno & asensio ramos , 2007 ; asensio ramos & trujillo bueno 2007 ) , but it does not give us information on the possible errors we make by not considering explicitly the physical mechanisms that are thought to be responsible for producing some optical thickness in such lines of neutral helium .    according to the above - mentioned non - lte radiative transfer investigations in 1d semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere there are two candidates for producing a significant optical thickness in the lines of the 10830   and d@xmath0 multiplets , given that the collisional excitations at typical solar chromospheric temperatures ( @xmath120000 k ) are unable to significantly populate the triplet levels of he i. the first mechanism states that the euv radiation irradiating the chromosphere ionizes part of the substantial amount of neutral helium atoms that are found in the ground singlet state at the typical chromospheric temperatures , which then lead to recombinations that produce an enhanced population of the triplet states ( e.g. , pozhalova 1988 ; avrett et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the second one deals with the possibility of collisional excitation by a significant amount of transition region material at temperatures greater than 20000 k ( e.g. , andretta & jones 1997 ) . in our opinion , as we shall try to show in this paper , detailed off - limb observations of the intensity and polarization profiles of the he i 10830   multiplet should help us determine which is the dominating mechanism , or if both are playing an equally significant role .",
    "the mechanism of collisional excitation at temperatures greater than 20000 k seems to require ( or is helped by ) the existence of a temperature  plateau \" located in the lower transition region ( tr ) of the sun , such as that included ad - hoc by vernazza et al .",
    "( 1981 ) in their semi - empirical models in order to be able to model the observed ly@xmath2 radiation .",
    "interestingly enough , the consideration of ambipolar diffusion effecs in such semi - empirical models led to a new series of models by fontenla et al .",
    "( 1990 ; 1991 ; 1993 ) that are able to explain the observed ly@xmath2 intensity observations without the need of such a tr  plateau \" . in this new series of semi - empirical models ( fal models ) , an enhanced population in the triplet states of he i can only be produced by the above mentioned photoionization - recombination process ( hereafter : the pr mechanism ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of the off - the - limb emission profiles of the 10830   and d@xmath0 lines to the amount of coronal euv radiation . to this end , we have chosen the above - mentioned fal - like models and have solved the rt problem in spherical geometry for increasing values of the euv coronal irradiance . as we shall see , this has allowed us to demonstrate that the intensity ratio of the blue and red components of the 10830   multiplet is a sensitive function of the amount of coronal euv illumination , and to establish this very observable as an ideal candidate for mapping the amount of coronal euv irradiance at more or less active off - limb locations and for determining whether or not the pr mechanism is truly the dominating one .",
    "we also show the variation of this intensity ratio with the atmospheric height when using an atmospheric model with a tr  plateau \" in the model s temperature profile . in our opinion ,",
    "the comparison of this type of simulations with observations should allow us to determine whether there is any off - limb region of the sun ( e.g. , above plages ? ) where collisional excitation plays a significant role in addition to the pr mechanism .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the formulation of the problem is presented in sect .",
    "2 , where we describe our approach to model the off - limb emission profiles of the aforementioned multiplets . section 3 focuses on the sensitivity of these profiles to the euv coronal irradiation and points out the existence of an interesting observable ( i.e. , the above - mentioned intensity ratio ) that can serve as diagnostic tool for this physical quantity . finally , in section 4",
    "we summarize the highlights and discuss possible lines of future research .",
    "for understanding the formation of these helium lines we carried out a series of non - lte radiative transfer calculations of the off - limb intensity profiles emerging from various semi - empirical atmospheric models using a 1d spherically symmetric geometry version of the rh code ( see _ http://www.nso.edu/staff/uitenbr/rh.html_ ) .",
    "this non - lte radiative transfer code , based on the multi - level accelerated lambda iteration ( mali ) scheme by rybicki & hummer ( 1991 , 1992 ) , solves the combined equations of statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer for a multilevel atom in a given stellar atmospheric model ( see also socas - navarro and trujillo bueno , 1997 ) .",
    "the code deals with overlapping transitions , and besides from the opacities and emissivities produced by the transitions in the _ active _ atom ( the one that is considered in full non - lte regime ) it also accounts for background radiation due to other atoms , molecules and relevant continuum processes .",
    "transitions are highlighted in the inset . ]",
    "the calculations of the emergent emission spectra were done in the context of the fal model atmospheres ( fontenla et al , 1990 , 1991 , 1993 ) , which require the above - mentioned pr mechanism for producing significant off - limb emission in the he i 10830   and @xmath3 multiplets . we have used these semi - empirical models as tabulated ( i.e. without considering any possible feedback effect of the euv irradiance on the models themselves ) .",
    "the main analysis is carried out with the fal - c model of the average quiet sun , although a comparison of the results among fal - c , fal - p ( representative of a plage region ) and the m@xmath4 model of avrett ( i.e. , the relatively cool m@xmath4 model atmosphere illustrative of the quiet sun that avrett ( 1995 ) proposed to account for the observed molecular co absorption at 4.6 @xmath5 m ) is described at the end of section 3 . in addition , we show also a comparison with the results obtained in the val - c model of vernazza et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , whose temperature plateau ( with @xmath6 k ) in its tr to the coronal gas , gives rise to a localized collisional enhancement of the triplet states populations .    the atomic model of he that we used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : atomic - model ] ) accounts for 165 possible bound - bound transitions taking place among 53 energy levels ( 46 of he i , 6 of he ii and 1 of he iii ) .",
    "the fine structure of the triplet energy levels was taken into account , together with all the possible combinations of transitions between them .",
    "the radiative transition parameters were obtained from the nist database and the collisional rate coefficients were calculated using the seaton ( 1962 ) impact approximation for neutral bound - bound and the van regemorter s ( 1962 ) approximation for treating bound - bound transitions caused by collisions with electrons . both photoionization and collisional ionization bound - free cross - sections",
    "are also tabulated in the atomic model file and were extracted from landolt - brnstein ( 1982 ) .        despite its simplicity from the atomic point of view",
    ", the atom of helium shows quite a complicated spectrum with two different spectral series : one of singlets ( para - helium ) involving singlet terms ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .. ) and the other one of triplets ( ortho - helium ) involving triplet terms ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .. ) . in the electric dipole approximation",
    ", quantum selection rules do not allow radiative transitions between singlet and triplet terms , so the populations of the two sets of levels are not radiatively coupled .",
    "for this reason , the lower energy level in the triplet system is a metastable one . at typical solar chromospheric conditions , the bulk of the helium population is mainly concentrated in the @xmath13s atomic ground level since the temperature is not high enough for populating the rest of the levels significantly .",
    "thus , the insufficent population of the triplet system can not account for the observed he i 10830   and 5876   features .",
    "it has been pointed out that the properties of the he i 10830   and @xmath3 multiplets depend mainly on the density and thickness of the chromosphere as well as on the incoming euv irradiation from the corona that incides on the chromosphere ( see pozhalova 1988 ; avrett et al . 1994 ; and earlier references therein ) . this euv spectrum with @xmath14   ionizes helium increasing the he ii number density , which subsequently recombine with the free electrons populating in this way both singlet and triplet systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination ] describes this process in 3 schematic steps ) .",
    "the excess population in the triplet energy levels is responsible for strengthening the he i 10830   and @xmath3 features .",
    "the inclusion of coronal irradiance incident on the chromosphere was implemented in the rh code using the euv flux given by tobiska ( 1991 ) .",
    "this author compiled data -provided by six different satellites- of the euv coronal irradiance that reached the earth in the period between 1962 and 1991 .",
    "these data were used to evaluate the chromospheric illumination due to coronal sources , which is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : tobiska ] .",
    "following the strategy described in the last section we carried out a thorough analysis of the sensitivity of the he i 10830   and d@xmath0 emission profiles to the ionizing coronal irradiance .",
    "we will show , in particular , how off - limb observations of the he i 10830   multiplet can serve as a diagnostic tool for this euv irradiance and discuss their use as a constraint for future atmospheric models .      in a first approach to understand the off - limb emission of the lines of the 10830   and d@xmath0 multiplets",
    "we compute the emergent profiles from the fal - c model atmosphere . in order to calculate the non - lte populations of he i and the emergent profiles we used a version of the rh code in 1d spherically symmetric geometry .",

    "the lower height corresponds to the first profile seen in emission off the limb . in the outermost layers of the fal - c model atmosphere",

    ", the amplitude of the emergent profiles grows until it reaches a maximum around 2000 km . below this point ,",
    "the emission starts decreasing slowly until it turns into absorption inside the limb .",
    "the interpretation is as follows : the density in the outer layers of the atmosphere ( at large distances from the limb ) is so low that it can not produce measurable emission profiles .",
    "as we go deeper into the atmosphere , the density increases quickly and so does the emission in the multiplets , until it reaches a maximum at a height of @xmath15 km .",
    "the extinction of the euv radiation as it travels inwards through the chromosphere leads to a reduction in the number of ionizations in the inner layers .",
    "thus , the emission in the spectral lines of the he i 10830   and d@xmath0 multiplets starts decreasing again because the pr mechanism can not sustain the populations of the triplet system .",

    "the tendency is clear : the stronger the ci , the greater the emission .",

    "the ratio @xmath19 @xmath20 of the amplitudes of the blue to red components of the multiplet changes substantially with the amount of ionizing radiation .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath3 shows no observable relative changes among its spectral components in response to the ionizing radiaton .",
    "we will see further on that this is just a natural consequence of the d@xmath0 line not reaching enough optical thickness in these models to show a differential saturation behavior .    in order to understand the changes in the 10830 profiles shown in fig .",

    "the amplitudes of the blue and red components were extracted from a double gaussian fitting to the emergent intensity spectra .",
    "the higher layers of the atmosphere , where the overlap between the two components due to the microturbulence did not allow an unambiguous determination of @xmath19 , were excluded from the calculation ( this is , above 1700 km in fal - p and over 2100 km in val - c , fal - c and the m@xmath42 model of avrett 1995 ) .",

    "[ fig : r - with - height ] illustrates the density ( _ gray _ ) and temperature ( _ black _ ) stratifications in these four atmospheres .",
    "while fal - p has a lower transition region ( tr ) boundary and a shallower chromosphere , all the other model atmospheres extend much higher and have thicker chromospheres . the lower height of the tr boundary in the fal - p atmosphere combined with the effect of the strong ionizing radiation coming downwards from the corona , shifts the region of formation of the he triplet towards lower heights in this model .",
    "higher up , the medium becomes too rarified to produce enough opacity at the 10830   wavelength .",
    "the density profile of the m@xmath42 model of avrett ( 1995 ) in the transition region is not as steep as in fal - c and fal - p .",
    "for this reason , @xmath19 does not decrease as fast in the highest layers of the atmosphere .",
    "the case for val - c is somewhat different .",
    "the presence of a temperature `` plateau '' at a height of 2100 km that defines a very thick transition region ( of a couple hundred km ) produces an increment of the population of the metastable level in this layer , even with no help from the ionizing radiation ( cf .",

    "[ fig : r - with - height-0ci],width=264 ]",
    "figure [ fig : r - with - height ] shows the change of @xmath19 with height in four different model atmospheres . this variation is a very interesting feature since it sets a constraint on the thermodynamical structure of the chromosphere and the amount of ionizing coronal irradiance inciding on it .",
    "@xmath19 is an observable than can easily be determined doing spectroscopic measurements of the he i 10830   multiplet .",
    "in fact , snchez - andrade nuo et al . ( 2007 ) made use of this theoretical prediction and have recently presented a series of observations of off - the - limb he i 10830    spectropolarimetric profiles aimed at the determination of @xmath19 . when comparing the observations with our radiative transfer modeling , they find that the theoretical behavior of the ratio @xmath19 agrees qualitatively with the observed one , although a quantitative comparison shows poor agreement .",
    "the density stratification and the limited vertical extent of the semiempirical model atmospheres considered in this paper are not adequate for spicule modeling .",
    "the fact that the solar chromosphere is very inhomogeneous on many scales and that spicules are small - scale intrusions of chromospheric matter into the hot corona , make it difficult for 1d models to reproduce off - limb observations .    the next step in this study should be to include in our rt modeling the spectral line polarization caused by the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects , as done by trujillo bueno & asensio ramos ( 2007 ) within the framework of the above - mentioned slab model .",
    "new spectropolarimetric observations , at different positions above the solar limb with different levels of ionizing radiation ( i.e. active regions and coronal holes ) should be compared to the theoretical calculations to help constrain the atmospheric models and the physical processes that induce the formation of the he i 10830   and d@xmath0 multiplets .",

    "<S> we report a series of off - the - limb non - lte calculations of the he i d@xmath0 and 10830   emission profiles , focusing our investigation on their sensitivity to the euv coronal irradiation and the model atmosphere used in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show in particular that the intensity ratio of the blue to the red components in the emission profiles of the he i 10830   multiplet turns out to be a good candidate as a diagnostic tool for the coronal irradiance . </S>",
