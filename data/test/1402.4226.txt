    "rayleigh - bnard system rotating uniformly about a vertical axis  @xcite is an interesting problem for studying pattern - forming instabilities and bifurcations ,  @xcite chaos ,  @xcite and turbulence  @xcite in addition to its potential applications in rotating cryogenics .  @xcite the rotation about a vertical axis introduces coriolis force as well as centrifugal force  @xcite in the flow .",
    "rubio , lopez & marques  @xcite showed interesting effects of the centrifugal force even for small values ( @xmath16 ) of the froude number @xmath17 , which is a ratio of the centrifugal force to the force of buoyancy .",
    "the coriolis force is known to break the mirror symmetry of the convective flow patterns  @xcite even at small rotation rates .",
    "chandrasekhar  @xcite analyzed the effects of coriolis force on the onset of convection in a rayleigh - bnard system .",
    "the linear theory of chandrasekhar predicted the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) through a stationary instability for fluids with prandtl number @xmath18 for all rotation rates .",
    "the selection of patterns is , however , a purely nonlinear phenomenon , and can not be determined by a linear theory .",
    "the non - linear analysis of the problem by kppers and lortz  @xcite ( kl ) showed that ( i ) a set of parallel rolls was the steady state solution at the instability onset for the dimensionless rotation rates ( @xmath19 ) below a critical value @xmath20 , and ( ii ) the convection was always unsteady at the instability onset for @xmath21 .",
    "this led to interesting pattern dynamics .",
    "a set of parallel rolls was found to be replaced by another set of parallel rolls oriented at an angle of about @xmath22 with the old rolls  @xcite for @xmath21 .",
    "the change in orientation of rolls was because of noise .",

    "however , the oscillatory convection may appear at small or moderate rotation rates for low - prandtl - number fluids .",
    "the previous investigations on instabilities and bifurcations above the onset of oscillatory rayleigh - bnard convection in fluids rotating uniformly about a vertical axis  @xcite were done in small simulation boxes .",

    "the other transition zone between the molten core and the lower mantle is also highly viscous and deformable .",
    "the transition zones on the two sides of earth s molten core have discontinuities , and they keep drifting non - uniformly . the boundary conditions for the velocity and the temperature fields are complex on these bounding surfaces .",
    "the boundaries of the  convective zone \" in stars ( @xmath31 ) are also complex .",
    "the numerical simulations to investigate the phenomenon of thermal convection in earth s molten core , or in the convective zones of a star , are usually done either with _ no - slip _ or _ free - slip _ ( _ stress - free _ ) boundary conditions on the velocity field .",
    "the no - slip conditions are appropriate where the bounding surfaces are rigid and stationary .",
    "the predictions of the simulations with no - slip boundary conditions have the advantage of being verified in controlled laboratory experiments .",
    "however , the stress - free boundary conditions may be a more useful approximation on a boundary between two liquids with a large difference in their viscosities .",
    "goldstein and graham  @xcite achieved almost stress - free boundaries in experiments .",
    "the famous kl instability  @xcite was predicted and understood for the first time by considering stress - free boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , the idealized boundary conditions are useful in developing simple models to investigate details of bifurcations qualitatively .",
    "both types of boundary conditions are useful for better understanding of the natural convection in geophysical and astrophysical problems in the absence of exact boundary conditions .    we present , in this article , the results of our investigations of the role of coriolis force on the convective instabilities near the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) in a low - prandtl - number fluid rotating uniformly about a vertical axis .",

    "we have carried out direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of three - dimensional flows in a box with thermally conducting and stress - free top and bottom surfaces for the purpose .",
    "the stress - free boundary conditions also allowed us to investigate the effects of coriolis force on the instabilities and bifurcations  @xcite observed in low - prandtl - number fluids without rotation .",

    "<S> we present the results of direct numerical simulations of flow patterns in a low - prandtl - number ( @xmath0 ) fluid above the onset of oscillatory convection in a rayleigh - bnard system rotating uniformly about a vertical axis . </S>",
    "<S> simulations were carried out in a periodic box with thermally conducting and stress - free top and bottom surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we considered a rectangular box ( @xmath1 ) and a wide range of taylor numbers ( @xmath2 ) for the purpose . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal aspect ratio @xmath3 of the box was varied from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the primary instability appeared in the form of two - dimensional standing waves for shorter boxes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flow patterns observed in boxes with @xmath8 and @xmath9 were different from those with @xmath10 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a competition between two sets of mutually perpendicular rolls at the primary instability in a square cell ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath11 , but observed a set of parallel rolls in the form of standing waves for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional convection was quasiperiodic or chaotic for @xmath13 , and then bifurcated into a two - dimensional periodic flow for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the convective structures consisted of the appearance and disappearance of straight rolls , rhombic patterns , and wavy rolls inclined at an angle @xmath15 with the straight rolls . </S>"
