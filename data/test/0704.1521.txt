    "astrophysical plasmas consist of both thermal particles and nonthermal , cosmic - ray ( cr ) particles that are closely coupled with permeating magnetic fields and underlying turbulent flows . in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of our galaxy , for example , an approximate energy equipartition among different components seems to have been established , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "understanding the complex network of physical interactions among these components constitutes one of fundamental problems in astrophysics .",
    "there is substantial observational evidence for the presence of nonthermal particles and magnetic fields in the large scale structure of the universe . a fair fraction of x - ray clusters",
    "have been observed in diffuse radio synchrotron emission , indicating the presence of gev cr electrons and @xmath2 g fields in the intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite .",
    "observations in euv and hard x - ray have shown that some clusters possess excess radiation compared to what is expected from the hot , thermal x - ray emitting icm , most likely produced by the inverse - compton scattering of cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) photons by cr electrons @xcite . assuming energy equipartition between cr electrons and magnetic fields , @xmath3 can be inferred in typical radio halos @xcite .",
    "if some of those cr electrons have been energized at shocks and/or by turbulence , the same process should have produced a greater cr proton population .",
    "considering the ratio of proton to electron numbers , @xmath4 , for galactic crs @xcite , one can expect @xmath5 in radio halos . however , cr protons in the icm have yet to be confirmed by the observation of @xmath6-ray photons produced by inelastic collisions between cr protons and thermal protons @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields have been also directly observed with faraday rotation measure ( rm ) . in clusters of galaxies strong fields of a few @xmath2 g strength extending from core to 500 kpc or further",
    "were inferred from rm observations @xcite .",
    "an _ upper limit _ of @xmath7 g was imposed on the magnetic field strength in filaments and sheets , based the observed limit of the rms of quasars outside clusters @xcite .",
    "studies on turbulence and turbulent magnetic fields in the large scale structure of the universe have been recently launched too .",
    "xmm - newton x - ray observations of the coma cluster , which seems to be in a post - merger stage , were analyzed in details to extract clues on turbulence in the icm @xcite . by analyzing pressure fluctuations , it was shown that the turbulence is likely subsonic and consistent with kolmogoroff turbulence .",
    "rm maps of clusters have been analyzed to find the power spectrum of turbulent magnetic fields in a few clusters @xcite . while @xcite reported a spectrum shallower than the kolmogoroff spectrum , @xcite argued that the spectrum could be consistent with the kolmogoroff spectrum if it is bended at a few kpc scale .",
    "these studies suggest that as in the ism , turbulence does exist in the icm and may constitute an energetically non - negligible component .    in galaxy cluster environments",
    "there are several possible sources of crs , magnetic fields , and turbulence : jets from active galaxies @xcite , termination shocks of galactic winds driven by supernova explosions @xcite , merger shocks @xcite , structure formation shocks @xcite , and motions of subcluster clumps and galaxies @xcite .",
    "all of them have a potential to inject a similar amount of energies , @xmath8 ergs into the icm . here",
    "we focus on shock scenarios .",
    "astrophysical shocks are collisionless shocks that form in tenuous cosmic plasmas via collective electromagnetic interactions between gas particles and magnetic fields .",
    "they play key roles in governing the nature of cosmic plasmas : 1 ) shocks convert a part of the kinetic energy of bulk flow motions into thermal energy , 2 ) shocks accelerate crs by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite , and amplify magnetic fields by streaming crs @xcite , 3 ) shocks generate magnetic fields via the biermann battery mechanism @xcite and the weibel instability @xcite , and 4 ) curved shocks generate vorticity and ensuing turbulent flows @xcite .    in @xcite ( paper i ) ,",
    "the properties of _ cosmological shock waves _ in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the energy dissipations into thermal and nonthermal components at those shocks were studied in a high - resolution , adiabatic ( non - radiative ) , hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "they found that internal shocks with low mach numbers of @xmath9 , which formed in the hot , previously shocked gas inside nonlinear structures , are responsible for most of the shock energy dissipation . adopting a nonlinear dsa model for cr protons",
    ", it was shown that about @xmath10 of the gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shocks through the history of the universe could be stored as crs . in a recent study",
    ", @xcite identified shocks and analyzed the statistics in smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of a @xmath0cdm universe , and found that their results are in good agreement with those of paper i. while internal shocks with lower mach numbers are energetically dominant , external accretions shocks with higher mach numbers can serve as possible acceleration sites for high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "it was shown that cr ions could be accelerated up to @xmath11 at cosmological shocks , where @xmath12 is the charge of ions @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( paper ii ) analyzed the distribution of vorticity , which should have been generated mostly at cosmological shock waves , in the same simulation of a @xmath0cdm universe as in paper i , and studied its implication on turbulence and turbulence dynamo .",
    "inside nonlinear structures , vorticity was found to be large enough that the turn - over time , which is defined as the inverse of vorticity , is shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "based on it @xcite argued that turbulence should have been developed in those structures and estimated the strength of the magnetic field grown by the turbulence .    in this paper , we study cosmological shock waves in a new set of hydrodynamic simulations of large structure formation in a concordance @xmath0cdm universe : an adiabatic ( non - radiative ) simulation which is similar to that considered in paper i , and two additional simulations which include various non - gravitational processes ( see the next section for details ) . as in papers",
    "i and ii , the properties of cosmological shock waves are analyzed , the energy dissipations to gas thermal energy and cr energy are evaluated , and the vorticity distribution is analyzed .",
    "we then compare the results for the three simulations to highlight the _ effects of non - gravitational processes _ on the properties of shocks and their roles on the cosmic plasmas in the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "simulations are described in  2 .",
    "the main results of shock identification and properties , energy dissipations , and vorticity distribution are described in  3 ,  4 , and  5 , respectively .",
    "summary and discussion are followed in  6 .",
    "the results reported here are based on the simulations previously presented in @xcite .",
    "the simulations included radiative processes of heating / cooling , and the two simulations with and without galactic superwind ( gsw ) feedbacks were compared in that paper . here",
    "an additional adiabatic ( non - radiative ) simulation with otherwise the same setup was performed .",
    "hereafter these three simulations are referred as `` adiabatic '' , `` no gsw '' , and `` gsw '' simulations , respectively .",
    "specifically , the wmap1-normalized @xmath0cdm cosmology was employed with the following parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.69 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18",
    ". a cubic box of comoving size @xmath19 was simulated using @xmath20 grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath21 particles for dark matter .",
    "it allows a uniform spatial resolution of @xmath22 . in papers i and ii",
    ", an adiabatic simulation in a cubic box of comoving size @xmath23 with @xmath20 grid zones and @xmath21 particles , employing slightly different cosmological parameters , was used .",
    "the simulations were performed using a pm / eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions for input physical ingredients such as non - equilibrium ionization / cooling , photoionization / heating , star formation , and feedback processes can be found in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "feedbacks from star formation were treated in three forms : ionizing uv photons , gsws , and metal enrichment .",
    "gsws were meant to represent cumulative supernova explosions , and modeled as outflows of several hundred @xmath24 .",
    "the input of gsw energy for a given amount of star formation was determined by matching the outflow velocities computed for star - burst galaxies in the simulation with those observed in the real world @xcite(see also * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the gas mass distribution in the gas density - temperature plane , @xmath25 , and the gas mass fraction as a function of gas temperature , @xmath26 , at @xmath27 for the three simulations .",
    "the distributions are quite different , depending primarily on the inclusion of radiative cooling and photoionization / heating .",
    "gsw feedbacks increase the fraction of the whim with @xmath28k , and at the same time affect the distribution of the warm / diffuse gas with @xmath29 .",
    "we start to describe cosmological shocks by briefing the procedure by which the shocks were identified in simulation data .",
    "the details can be found in paper i. a zone was tagged as a _ shock zone _ currently experiencing shock dissipation , whenever the following three criteria are met : 1 ) the gradients of gas temperature and entropy have the same sign , 2 ) the local flow is converging with @xmath30 , and 3 ) @xmath31 corresponding to the temperature jump of a shock with @xmath32 .",
    "typically a shock is represented by a jump spread over @xmath33 tagged zones .",
    "hence , a _ shock center _ was identified within the tagged zones , where @xmath34 is minimum , and this center was labeled as part of a shock surface .",
    "the mach number of the shock center , @xmath35 , was calculated from the temperature jump across the entire shock zones . finally to avoid confusion from complex flow patterns and shock surface topologies associated with very weak shocks , only those portions of shock surfaces with @xmath36 were kept and used for the analysis of shocks properties .",
    "figure 2 shows the locations of identified shocks in a two - dimensional slice at @xmath27 in the gsw simulation .",
    "the locations are color - coded according to shock speed .",
    "as shown before in paper i , _ external _ accretion shocks encompass nonlinear structures and reveal , in addition to cluster complexes , rich topology of filamentary and sheet - like structures in the large scale structure . inside the nonlinear structures , there exist complex networks of _ internal _ shocks that form by infall of previously shocked gas to filaments and knots and during subclump mergers , as well as by chaotic flow motions .",
    "the shock heated gas around clusters extends out to @xmath37 , much further out than the observed x - ray emitting volume .    in the gsw simulation , with several hundred @xmath24 for outflows , the gsw feedbacks affected most greatly the gas around groups of galaxies , while the impact on clusters with @xmath38 kev was minimal . in figure 3",
    "we compare shock locations in a region around two groups with @xmath39 kev in the three simulations .",
    "it demonstrates that gsw feedbacks pushed the hot gas out of groups with typical velocities of @xmath40 ( green points ) .",
    "in fact the prominent green balloons of shock surfaces around groups in figure 2 are due to gsw feedbacks ( see also figure 4 of * ? ? ? * ) .    in the left panels of figure 4",
    "we compare the surface area of identified shocks , normalized by the volume of the simulation box , per logarithmic mach number interval , @xmath41 ( top ) , and per logarithmic shock speed interval , @xmath42 ( bottom ) , at @xmath27 in the three simulations . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in units of @xmath45 and @xmath24 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 provides a measure of shock frequency or the inverse of the mean comoving distance between shock surfaces .",
    "the distributions of @xmath41 for the no gsw and gsw simulations are similar , while that for the adiabatic simulation is different from the other two .",
    "this is mainly because the gas temperature outside nonlinear structures is lower without photoionization / heating in the adiabatic simulation . as a result ,",
    "external accretion shocks tend to have higher mach number due to colder preshock gas .",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 , on the other hand , is similar for all three simulations for @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , however , there are more shocks in the adiabatic simulation ( black points in figure 3 ) .",
    "again this is because in the adiabatic simulation the gas temperature is colder in void regions , and so even shocks with low speeds of @xmath47 were identified in these regions .",
    "the gsw simulation shows slightly more shocks than the no gsw simulation around @xmath48 , because gsw feedbacks created balloon - shaped surfaces of shocks with typically those speeds ( green points in figure 3 ) .    for identified shocks",
    ", we calculated the incident shock kinetic energy flux , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the preshock gas density .",
    "we then calculated the kinetic energy flux through shock surfaces , normalized by the volume of the simulation box , per logarithmic mach number interval , @xmath51 , and per logarithmic shock speed interval , @xmath52 . in the right panels of figure 4",
    ", we compare the flux at @xmath27 in the three simulations . once again , there are noticeable differences in @xmath51 between the adiabatic simulation and the other two simulations , which can be interpreted as the result of ignoring photoionization / heating in the gas outside nonlinear structures in the adiabatic simulation .",
    "gsw feedbacks enhance only slightly the shock kinetic energy flux for @xmath53 , as can be seen in the plot of @xmath52 .",
    "yet , the total amount of the energy flux is expected to be quite similar for all three simulations .",
    "this implies that the overall energy dissipation at cosmological shocks is governed mainly by the gravity of matter , and that the inclusion of various non - gravitational processes such as radiative cooling , photoionization / heating , and gsw feedbacks have rather minor , local effects .",
    "we note that a _ temperature floor _ of @xmath54 was used for the three simulations in this work , while @xmath55 k was set in paper i. it was because in paper i only an adiabatic simulation was considered and the @xmath56 k temperature floor was enforced to mimic the effect of photoionization / heating on the igm .",
    "however we found that when the same temperature floor is enforced , the statistics of the current adiabatic simulation agree excellently with those of paper i. specifically , the shock frequency and kinetic energy flux , @xmath41 and @xmath51 , for weak shocks with @xmath57 are a bit higher in the current adiabatic simulation , because of higher spatial resolution .",
    "but the total kinetic energy flux through shock surfaces , @xmath58 , agrees within a few percent .",
    "on the other hand , in paper i we were able to reasonably distinguish external and internal shocks according to the preshock temperature , external shocks if @xmath59 and internal shocks if @xmath60 .",
    "we no longer made such distinction in this work , since the preshock temperature alone can not tell us whether the preshock gas is inside nonlinear structures or not in the simulations with radiative cooling .",
    "the cr injection and acceleration rates at shocks depend in general upon the shock mach number , field obliquity angle , and the strength of the alfvn turbulence responsible for scattering . at quasi - parallel shocks ,",
    "in which the mean magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal direction , small anisotropy in the particle velocity distribution in the local fluid frame causes some particles in the high energy tail of the maxwellian distribution to stream upstream @xcite .",
    "the streaming motions of the high energy particles against the background fluid generate strong mhd alfvn waves upstream of the shock , which in turn scatter particles and amplify magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the scattered particles can then be accelerated further to higher energies via fermi first order process @xcite .",
    "these processes , leakage of suprathermal particles into crs , self - excitation of alfvn waves , amplification of magnetic fields , and further acceleration of crs , are all integral parts of collisionless shock formation in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "it was shown that at strong quasi - parallel shocks , @xmath61 of the incoming particles can be injected into the cr population , up to 60% of the shock kinetic energy can be transferred into cr ions , and at the same time substantial nonlinear feedbacks are exerted to the underlying flow @xcite .",
    "at perpendicular shocks with weakly perturbed magnetic fields , on the other hand , particles gain energy mainly by drifting along the shock surface in the @xmath62 electric field",
    ". such drift acceleration can be much more efficient than the acceleration at parallel shocks @xcite .",
    "but the particle injection into the acceleration process is expected to be inefficient at perpendicular shocks , since the transport of particles normal to the average field direction is suppressed @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the injection problem at perpendicular shocks can be alleviated substantially in the presence of fully turbulent fields owing to field line meandering .",
    "as in paper i , the gas thermalization and cr acceleration efficiencies are defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , where @xmath65 is the thermal energy flux generated and @xmath66 is the cr energy flux accelerated at shocks .",
    "we note that for gasdynamical shocks without crs , the gas thermalization efficiency can be calculated from the rankine - hugoniot jump condition , as follows : @xmath67v_2 \\bigg/ \\left({1\\over2}\\rho_1 v_1 ^ 2\\right),\\ ] ] where the subscripts 1 and 2 stand for preshock and postshock regions , respectively .",
    "the second term inside the brackets subtracts the effect of adiabatic compression occurred at a shock too , not just the thermal energy flux entering the shock , namely , @xmath68 .    at cr",
    "modified shocks , however , the gas thermalization efficiency can be much smaller than @xmath69 for strong shocks with large @xmath35 , since a significant fraction of the shock kinetic energy can be transferred to crs .",
    "the gas thermalization and cr acceleration efficiencies were estimated using the results of dsa simulations of quasi - parallel shocks with bohm diffusion coefficient , self - consistent treatments of thermal leakage injection , and alfvn wave propagation @xcite .",
    "the simulations were started with purely gasdynamical shocks in one - dimensional , plane - parallel geometry , and cr acceleration was followed by solving the diffusion - convection equation explicitly with very high resolution .",
    "shocks with @xmath70 km s@xmath71 propagating into media of @xmath72 k were considered .",
    "after a quick initial adjustment , the postshock states reach time asymptotic values and the cr modified shocks evolve in an approximately self - similar way with the shock structure broadening linearly with time ( refer * ? ? ? * for details ) . given this self - similar nature of cr modified shocks , we calculated time asymptotic values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the ratios of increases in the gas thermal and cr energies at shocks to the kinetic energy passed through the shocks at the termination time of the dsa simulations .",
    "( 1 ) , the increase of energies due to adiabatic compression was subtracted .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath73 and @xmath74 estimated from dsa simulations and their fittings for the cases with and without a preexisting cr component .",
    "the fitting formulae are given in appendix a. without a preexisting cr component , gas thermalization is more efficient than cr acceleration at shocks with @xmath75 .",
    "however , it is likely that weak internal shocks propagate through the igm that contains crs accelerated previously at earlier shocks . in that case , shocks with preexisting crs need to be considered . since the presence of preexisting crs is equivalent to a higher injection rate , cr acceleration is more efficient in that case , especially at shocks with @xmath75 @xcite . in the bottom panel the efficiencies for shocks with @xmath76 in the preshock region are shown . for comparison , @xmath69 for shocks without crs is also drawn . both @xmath73 and @xmath74 increase with mach number , but @xmath74 asymptotes to @xmath77 while @xmath73 to @xmath78 for strong shocks with @xmath79 .",
    "so about twice more energy goes into crs , compared to for gas heating , at strong shocks .    the efficiencies for the case without a preexisting cr component in the upper panel of figure 5",
    "can be directly compared with the same quantities presented in figure 6 of paper i. in paper i , however , the gas thermalization efficiency was not calculated explicitly from dsa simulations , and hence @xmath69 for gasdynamic shocks was used .",
    "it represents gas thermalization reasonably well for weak shocks with @xmath80 , but overestimates gas thermalization for stronger cr modified shocks .",
    "our new estimate for @xmath74 is close to that in paper i , but a bit smaller , especially for shocks with @xmath81 .",
    "this is because inclusion of alfvn wave drift and dissipation in the shock precursor reduces the effective velocity change experienced by crs in the new dsa simulations of @xcite .    a note of caution for @xmath74 should be in order .",
    "as outlined above , cr injection is less efficient and so the cr acceleration efficiency would be lower at perpendicular shocks , compared to at quasi - parallel shocks .",
    "cr injection and acceleration at oblique shocks are not well understood quantitatively . and",
    "the magnetic field directions at cosmological shocks are not known . considering these and other uncertainties involved in the adopted dsa model",
    ", we did not attempt to make further improvements in estimating @xmath73 and @xmath74 at general oblique shocks .",
    "but we expect that an estimate at realistic shocks with chaotic magnetic fields and random shock obliquity angles would give reduced values , rather than increased values , for @xmath74 .",
    "so @xmath74 given in figure 5 may be regarded as _",
    "upper limits_.    by adopting the efficiencies in figures 5 , we calculated the thermal and cr energy fluxes dissipated at cosmological shocks , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , using @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in the same way we calculated @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the previous section .",
    "we then integrated from @xmath88 to @xmath27 the shock kinetic energy passed and the thermal and cr energies dissipated through shock surfaces as follows : @xmath89 } \\over { d \\log x } } dt,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath90 stands for the kinetic , thermal , or cr energies fluxes , the variable @xmath91 is either @xmath35 or @xmath44 , and @xmath92 is the total gas thermal energy at @xmath27 inside the simulation box normalized by its volume .",
    "figure 6 shows the resulting @xmath93 and @xmath94 and their cumulative distributions , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , for the gsw simulation .",
    "weak shocks with @xmath97 or fast shocks with @xmath98 are responsible most for shock dissipations , as already noted in paper i. while the thermal energy generation peaks at shocks in the range @xmath99 , the cr energy peaks in the range @xmath100 if no preexisting crs are included or in the range @xmath99 if preexisting crs of @xmath101 in the preshock region are included . with our adopted efficiencies , the total cr energy accelerated and the total gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shocks throughout the history of the universe are compared as @xmath102 , when no preexisting crs are present . with preexisting crs in the preshock region , the cr acceleration becomes more efficient , so @xmath103 , the total cr energy accelerated at cosmological shocks is estimated to be 1.7 times the total gas thermal energy dissipated .",
    "we note here again that these are not meant to be very accurate estimates of the cr energy in the igm , considering the difficulty of modeling shocks as well as the uncertainties in the dsa model itself .",
    "however , they imply that the igm and the whim , which are bounded by strong external shocks with high @xmath35 and filled with weak internal shocks with low @xmath35 , could contain a dynamically significant cr population .",
    "cosmological shocks formed in the large scale structure of the universe are by nature curved shocks , accompanying complex , often chaotic flow patterns .",
    "it is well known that vorticity , @xmath104 , is generated at such curved oblique shocks @xcite . in paper ii , the generation of vorticity behind cosmological shocks and turbulence dynamo of magnetic fields in the igm were studied in an adiabatic @xmath0cdm simulation . in this study we analyzed the distribution of vorticity in the three simulations to assess quantitatively the effects of non - gravitational processes . here",
    "we present the magnitude of vorticity with the vorticity parameter @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath107 . with @xmath108 interpreted as local eddy turnover time",
    ", @xmath109 represents the number of local eddy turnovers in the age of the universe .",
    "so if @xmath110 , we expect that turbulence has been fully developed after many turnovers .",
    "figure 7 shows fluid quantities and shock locations in a two - dimensional slice of @xmath111 , delineated by a solid box in figure 2 , at @xmath27 in the gsw simulations .",
    "the region contains two clusters with @xmath112 kev in the process of merging .",
    "bottom right panel shows that vorticity increases sharply at shocks .",
    "the postshock gas has a larger amount of vorticity than the preshock gas , indicating that most , if not all , of the vorticity in the simulation was produced at shocks .",
    "figure 8 shows the gas mass distribution in the gas density - vorticity parameter plane , @xmath113 , ( upper panel ) and the gas mass fraction per logarithmic @xmath109 interval , @xmath114 , ( bottom panel ) for the three simulations .",
    "the most noticeable point in the upper panel is that vorticity is higher at the highest density regions with @xmath115 in the no gsw and gsw simulations than in the adiabatic simulation .",
    "this is due to the additional flow motions induced by cooling .",
    "inclusion of gsw feedbacks , on the other hand , does not alter significantly the overall distribution in the gas density - vorticity parameter plane .",
    "the bottom panel indicates that cooling increased the mass fraction with large vorticity @xmath116 , while reduced the mass fraction with @xmath117 .",
    "gsw feedbacks increased slightly the mass fraction with @xmath118 , which corresponds to the gas in the regions outskirts of groups that expand further out due to gsws ( balloons around groups ) .",
    "but overall we conclude that the non - gravitational processes considered in this paper have limited effects on vorticity in the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "we note that the highest density regions in the no gsw and gsw simulations have @xmath119 on average .",
    "as described in details in paper ii , such values of @xmath109 imply that local eddies have turned over many times in the age of the universe , so that the icm gas there has had enough time to develop magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "so in those regions , magnetic fields should have grown to have the energy approaching to the turbulent energy . on the other hand , the gas with @xmath120 , mostly in filamentary and sheet - like structures , has @xmath121 .",
    "mhd turbulence should not have been fully developed there and turbulence growth of magnetic fields would be small .",
    "finally in the low density void regions with @xmath122 , vorticity is negligible with @xmath123 on average , as expected .",
    "we identified cosmological shock waves and studied their roles on cosmic plasmas in three cosmological n - body / hydrodynamic simulations for a concordance @xmath0cdm universe in a cubic box of comoving size @xmath19 : 1 ) adiabatic simulation ( adiabatic ) , 2 ) simulation with radiative cooling and photoionization / heating ( no gsw ) , and 3 ) same as the second simulation but also with galactic superwind feedbacks ( gsw ) .",
    "the statistics and energetics of shocks in the adiabatic simulation are in an excellent agreement with those of paper i where an adiabatic simulation with slightly different cosmological parameters in a cubic box of comoving size @xmath23 was analyzed .    photoionization / heating raised the gas temperature outside nonlinear structures in the no gsw and gsw simulations . as a result ,",
    "the number of identified shocks and their mach numbers in the no gsw and gsw simulations were different from those in the adiabatic simulation .",
    "gsw feedbacks pushed out gas most noticeably around groups , creating balloon - shaped surfaces of shocks with speed @xmath124 in the gsw simulation . however , those have minor effects on shock energetics . the total kinetic energy passed through shock surfaces throughout the history of the universe",
    "is very similar for all three simulations .",
    "so we conclude that the energetics of cosmological shocks was governed mostly by the gravity of matter , and the effects non - gravitational processes , such as radiative cooling , photoionization / heating , and gsw feedbacks , were rather minor and local .",
    "we estimated both the _ improved _ gas thermalization efficiency , @xmath73 , and cr acceleration efficiency , @xmath74 , as a function shock mach number , from nonlinear diffusive shock simulations for quasi - parallel shocks that assumed bohm diffusion for cr protons and incorporated self - consistent treatments of thermal leakage injection and alfvn wave propagation @xcite .",
    "the cases without and with a preexisting cr component of @xmath101 in the preshock region were considered . at strong shocks ,",
    "both the injection and acceleration of crs are very efficient , and so the presence of a preexisting cr component is not important . at shocks with with @xmath79 ,",
    "about 55 % of the shock kinetic energy goes into crs , while about 30 % becomes the thermal energy . at weak shocks , on the other hand , without a preexisting cr component , the gas thermalization is more efficient than the cr acceleration .",
    "but the presence of a preexisting cr component is critical at weak shocks , since it is equivalent to a higher injection rate and the cr acceleration becomes more efficient with it . as a result , @xmath74 is higher than @xmath73 even at shocks with @xmath75 .",
    "however , at perpendicular shocks , the cr injection is suppressed , and so the cr acceleration could be less efficient than at parallel shocks .",
    "thus our cr shock acceleration efficiency should be regarded as an upper limit .    with the adopted efficiencies ,",
    "the total cr energy accelerated at cosmological shocks throughout the history of the universe is estimated to be @xmath125 , 1/2 of the total gas thermal energy dissipated , when no preexisting crs are present . with a preexisting cr component of @xmath101 in the preshock region , @xmath126 , the total cr energy accelerated is estimate to be 1.7 times the total gas thermal energy dissipated .",
    "although these are not meant to be very accurate estimates of the cr energy in the icm , they imply that the icm could contain a dynamically significant cr population .",
    "we also examined the distribution of vorticity inside the simulation box , which should have been generated mostly at curved cosmological shocks . in the icm , the eddy turn - over time , @xmath127 , is about 1/30 of the age of the universe , @xmath128 . in filamentary and sheet - like structures , @xmath129 , while @xmath123 in void regions .",
    "radiative cooling increased the fraction of gas mass with large vorticity @xmath116 , while reduced the mass fraction with @xmath117 .",
    "gsw feedbacks increased slightly the mass fraction with @xmath118 .",
    "although the effects of these non - gravitation effects are not negligible , the overall distribution of vorticity are similar for the three simulations .",
    "so we conclude that the non - gravitational processes considered in this paper do not affect significantly the vorticity in the large scale structure of the universe .",

    "<S> cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced by hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> these shocks govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal , cosmic - ray ( cr ) particles . </S>",
    "<S> we study the statistics and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance @xmath0cdm universe , with a special emphasis on the effects of non - gravitational processes such as radiative cooling , photoionization / heating , and galactic superwind feedbacks . adopting an improved model for gas thermalization and cr acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we then estimate the gas thermal energy and the cr energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> since shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity , we also examine the vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in cosmological simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks are governed primarily by the gravity of matter , so other non - gravitational processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and vorticity generation at cosmological shocks . </S>",
    "<S> our results reinforce scenarios in which the intracluster medium and warm - hot intergalactic medium contain energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent flow motions . </S>"
