    "one of the most intringuing empirical observations about deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) on a proton is the geometric scaling property @xcite , which states that the @xmath0 total cross - section data can be approximately ploted on a one - dimensional curve @xmath1 where @xmath2 span the virtuality - rapidity kinematical domain of dis .",
    "one finds @xmath3    the question we want to address is whether the observed geometric scaling can be explained in terms of qcd evolution equations describing _",
    "saturation_.    saturation of parton ( mainly gluon ) densities at high rapidity may be at the origin of the geometric scaling property .",
    "saturation is expected to occur when a high density of partons is created in the limited geometry of the target . in the expected scenario ,",
    "the parton wave functions overlap and eventually create a new state of matter , the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite . in the case of dis on a proton , increasing densities are obtained by high - energy evolution at fixed virtuality @xmath4 when the corresponding linear qcd evolution , named bfkl after balitsky , kuraev , lipatov , and fadin @xcite , gives rise to an exponential growth of the number of gluons . at high enough energy",
    "the bfkl formulation gets modified . in the approximation of uncorrelated hard probes , one deals with the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , where the corrections due to the high density of partons are expressed in terms of a non - linear damping term .",
    "we shall investigate whether and how geometric scaling could be due to the nonlinear qcd evolution of the gluon distribution in the target .",
    "let us start from the bk equation expressed in momentum space ( using the impact - parameter independent formulation ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is related to the tranverse - momentum @xmath7 distribution of gluons in the target .",
    "the ( leading order ) bfkl kernel is @xmath8 the coupling constant will be considered either constant , or running like @xmath9    from a mathematical point of view , the bk equation can be related @xcite to an `` universality class '' of nonlinear equations for which characteristic properties can be rigorously derived .",
    "`` universality '' means here that the solutions have general characteristics which are essentially independent from initial conditions . in the case of the bk equation ( and also for some extensions beyond bk )",
    "this generic feature is the formation of _ traveling wave _",
    "patterns when the energy increases . as we shall see , traveling waves are intimately related to geometric scaling .",
    "let us define these traveling waves and give a qualitative explanation of their formation during the rapidity evolution .",
    "consider first the `` diffusive approximation '' of the bfkl kernel@xmath10 by a suitable redefinition of the function and variables one can map the bk equation in the diffusive approximation onto the fisher kolmogorov - petrovski - piskounov ( f - kpp ) equation @xcite describing a reaction - diffusion process in space and time : @xmath11 in reaction - diffusion language , @xmath12 is the diffusion term , @xmath13 is responsible for the exponential growth and @xmath14 the damping term .",
    "the `` dictionnary '' between f - kpp and bk can be written as follows  t  & & y   + space  x  & & l+12  |(12 )   y   + wave  front  u(x - ct ) & &   n(l - vy )   + traveling   waves  & & geometric   scaling .",
    "( in qcd : strong absorption ) and @xmath15 ( in qcd : transparency ) travels from the left to the right as @xmath16 ( in qcd : @xmath17 ) increases.,width=377 ]    the key feature of the solutions of the f - kpp equation ( and of equations belonging to the same universality class ) is the formation of traveling wave patterns , see fig.([dis ] ) .",
    "it can be rigorously proven that , at large times ( @xmath18 large rapidities ) , the solutions verify @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 is the implicit solution of the characteristic equation @xmath22 which leads to the asymptotic wave speed @xmath23 it plays the rle of a critical qcd anomalous dimension .",
    "one immediately recognizes the equivalence between geometric scaling and traveling waves solutions of bk .",
    "moreover , quite a detailed information can be obtained from the sole knowledge of the linear kernel , as for the three first terms @xcite of the asymptotic expansion of the saturation scale @xmath24",
    "in fact the results using the diffusive approximation of bk and its mapping to the f - kpp equation are more general . instead of entering here in refined ( and",
    "technically useful ) mathematical arguments @xcite , let us qualitatively illustrate the reason why traveling wave patterns generically develop during the rapidity evolution from a given initial condition , using the concepts of `` pulled fronts '' .     is represented for the three different classes of initial conditions .",
    "top : `` pushed fronts , '' the wave front keeps the initial front profile with a non - universal speed @xmath25 middle : `` pulled = pushed '' ; bottom : `` pulled front : '' both the wave front and the speed acquire universal values at large @xmath26 in an intermediate kinematical region called the `` wave interior''.,width=302 ]    universality features are obtained in the `` pulled '' front situation , see the bottom plot of fig.([front ] ) . in this case , one starts with initial conditions corresponding to an anomalous dimension @xmath27 where @xmath28 is for the ( leading order ) bfkl kernel @xcite .",
    "the formation of the traveling wave comes from the competition between the exponential growth at small values of the solution @xmath29 where the linear term dominates the evolution , with the nonlinear damping exercised at larger values of @xmath30 constrained by these two opposite trends , the solution is `` forced '' to adopt an universal behaviour .",
    "fortunately enough , the perturbative qcd initial conditions , through the transparency property ( @xmath31 ) , fall into the universal `` pulled '' front regime @xcite .    in fig.([reduced",
    "] ) the `` reduced front '' @xmath32 obtained by factorizing out the wave propagation , is represented for fixed ( left ) and running ( right ) coupling constant .",
    "it shows the scaling straight line , which envelopes the curves obtained for increasing rapidity .",
    "hence geometric scaling violations are also predicted due to diffusion .",
    "one may notice that the diffusive approach to scaling is slower for running coupling , corresponding to `` anomalous diffusion '' in @xmath33 ( for running coupling @xmath34 ) .",
    "normal diffusion @xmath35 is characteristic of the f - kpp universality class or bk with fixed coupling .",
    "the abovementionned mathematical properties have the major interest of revealing the link between geomeric scaling and the nonlinear dynamics of qcd evolution equations at high energy .",
    "however the path from phenomenology to theory is not yet accomplished . on the phenomenological ground , the simulations of bk equation solutions @xcite have shown that pre - asymptotics effects may be important and endenger geometrical scaling predictions from qcd in the physical region where it is observed .",
    "on the theory side , it has been recently realized @xcite that the effect of parton fluctuations and correlations , especially in the dilute ( transparency ) region which is the driving force of the pulled front , may be responsible for a breaking of geometric scaling .",
    "in fact , traveling wave patterns still exist @xcite but their event - by - event fluctuations tends to break geometric scaling in the average .    despite these problems , the numerical simulations @xcite also show that patterns behaving like traveling waves exist in a preasymptotic region in energy .",
    "moreover the mean field bk equation seems to be still valid in this region . in order to explore this possibility and understand its origin , we proposed @xcite to attack the problem of traveling wave solutions of the bk equation in a new way .",
    "the initial mathematical idea @xcite is to assume and directly insert a traveling wave solution @xmath36 into the f - kpp equation , or equivalently to impose a geometric scaling form to a solution of the bk equation .",
    "keeping for simplicity the space - time language and the fkpp equation ( the dictionnary to bk being still easy ) , one gets @xmath37 taking into account the previous study showing @xcite that the wave speed @xmath38 we obtain an iterative solution @xmath39 obeying an exactly solvable @xcite hierarchy of equations for the @xmath40 s .",
    "the first one only ( for @xmath41 ) is nonlinear and can be exactly solved , the other boiling down to a rather simple linear algebra .",
    "this mathematical result translates into a _ parametric _ form of a geometric scale invariant gluon amplitude @xmath42 which can be used in phenomenology .",
    "@xmath43 depends only on few parameters determined by the linear kernel .",
    "one obtains @xmath44^{\\mu}}\\!-\\!{\\frac}1{c^2}\\ { \\frac}{\\left[{\\frac}{k^2}{q^2_s(y)}\\right]^{\\mu } } { \\left(1\\!+\\!\\left[{\\frac}{k^2}{q^2_s(y)}\\right ] ^{\\mu}\\right)^2}\\    \\log { \\frac}{\\left(1\\!+\\!\\left[{\\frac}{k^2}{q^2_s(y)}\\right]^{\\mu}\\right)^2 } { 4\\left[{\\frac}{k^2}{q^2_s(y)}\\right]^{\\mu}}\\ .\\ ] ]    this solution ( valid also for the running case with an appropriate mapping @xcite ) is mathematically valid @xcite in the `` wave interior '' , see fig.([front ] ) . remarkably , we observed that the corresponding region has a large overlap with the physical region where geometrical scaling is valid at hera . in order to check this opportunity , we determined the phenomenological observable related to @xmath45 from a mrst parametrization of @xmath46 data .     as a fonction of @xmath47 for different values of @xmath48 full lines",

    "dashed lines : parametric qcd traveling waves.,width=415 ]    the obtained kernel parameters are not far but different from those expected from the leading order bfkl kernel one and thus could require higher order contributions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , higher order contributions plays an important rle in a different but related problem : the existence of `` backward '' traveling waves appearing @xcite from the energy evolution starting from an inital high density ( and not initial low density as in dis ) state , which could be the case in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "traveling wave patterns have been shown to result from nonlinear qcd equations .",
    "the phenomenologically observed geometric scaling in dis on a proton at large energy is consistent with the traveling wave patterns .",
    "it remains to be found whether one can relate the geometric scaling curve with the qcd kernel and more generally to a complete solution of high - energy qcd , including correlation and fluctuation contributions .",
