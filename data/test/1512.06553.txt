    "we consider some potential mechanisms of the suppressions by in - plane field : besides the pure charge carrier injection , one can expect that the in - plane electric field can also force the electrons in the `` david star '' to be delocalized .",
    "moreover , the in - plane electric field might depinning the cdw , which is suggested in @xmath0-tas@xmath1 bulk single crystals @xcite .",
    "the suppression of ccdw by in - plane electric field might also be due to the thermal activation by local joule heating as current flows through the material .",
    "the real mechanism of the suppression of ccdw by in - plane field needs to be figured out by more experimental and theoretical works .",
    "here we only offer a general description of such process : although ccdw state might still have the lower energy , the in - plane electric field can drive the system to cross over the energy barrier from ccdw to nccdw or other metastable phase , as shown in the schematic diagram in fig .",

    "eliashberg function ( left ) and the integrated electron - phonon coupling strength ( right ) for ( a ) the doped bulk @xmath0-tas@xmath1 with @xmath46 holes / f.u . and ( b ) the doped monolayer @xmath0-tas@xmath1 with @xmath47 holes / f.u . under a tensile strain of 2.5% , respectively . ]    as described above , once long range ccdw is suppressed , the transition between mott insulating state to metallic state can be observed : when ccdw is suppressed , domain walls show up , which can be seen as conducting channels to induce metallic state @xcite . in the ccdw area near the domain walls , the hubbard states are weakening and broadening and the mott gap is reduced .",
    "@xcite . furthermore",
    ", superconductivity can emerge in percolated metallic ic network @xcite .",
    "while we are not able to directly model the textured ic phase , we can still estimate the superconductivity using @xmath0 structure qualitatively . approximately using the high symmetry doped bulk @xmath0-tas@xmath1 with @xmath46 holes / f.u . and the doped monolayer @xmath0-tas@xmath1 with @xmath47 holes / f.u . under a tensile strain of 2.5% , for which all the phonon instabilities are just suppressed , we estimated the potential carrier doping induced superconductivity by the electron - phonon coupling calculation .",
    "figure [ fig_7_a2f ] shows the calculated eliashberg spectral function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of states at @xmath19 , @xmath50 is phonon frequency , @xmath51 is electronic energy , and @xmath52 is electron - phonon coupling matrix element .",
    "the total electron - phonon coupling strength is then @xmath53 the calculated @xmath54 for the two samples are 0.81 and 0.96 , respectively .",
    "we estimated @xmath2 based on the modified mcmillan formula @xcite : @xmath55 where the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath56 is set to a typical value of @xmath57 .",
    "the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 the calculated @xmath58 for the two samples are 136.7 and 98.4 k , respectively . using those parameters , we can estimate that the superconductivity with @xmath2 of @xmath3 k can emerge in the hole doped @xmath0-tas@xmath1 . to observe the superconductivity we predicted ,",
    "the doping induced metallic network between ccdw domain in nccdw or other metastable phase must be percolated , which requires experimental devices with ability to dope more holes .",
    "recently , suda et al . suggested a high level hole doping technique using photoactive electric double layer @xcite , which might be applied to verify our prediction .",
    "in conclusion , based on the first - principles calculation , we simulated the carrier doping effect in the bulk and monolayer @xmath0-tas@xmath1 .",
    "we found that ccdw is stable upon electron doping , while hole doping can notably suppress the ccdw . according to our analysis ,",
    "the different mechanisms of the reported electric and photoelectric manipulations of ccdw in @xmath0-tas@xmath1 are figured out : light or positive perpendicular electric field induced hole doping significantly increases the energy of ccdw , so that the system transforms to nccdw or similar metastable state . although the ccdw distortion is more stable upon the in - plane electric field induced electron injection , some accompanied effects can drive the system to cross over the energy barrier from ccdw to nccdw or similar metastable state .",
    "we also estimated that a potential superconductivity with @xmath2 of @xmath3 k can be introduced by hole doping in the system . by tuning the carrier density , controllable switching of different states such as ccdw / mott insulating state , metallic state , and even the superconducting state",
    "can be realized in @xmath0-tas@xmath1 , which makes the novel material have a very promising application in the future electronic devices .",
