    "multi - component attractive fermionic systems with unequal masses , densities or chemical potentials have attracted continued interest for many decades in several fields of physics ranging from high - energy  @xcite to condensed matter  @xcite and , more recently , atomic physics  @xcite . the interplay between pairing and density imbalance of the different fermion species leads to a rich scenario , which includes the possibility of various exotic superconducting states  @xcite . in this context , the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase  @xcite has recently attracted a great deal of interest from both the experimental and the theoretical community  @xcite . in the fflo phase cooper pairing occurs between a fermion with momentum @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 and a fermion with momentum @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and spin @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "the superconducting order parameter becomes spatially dependent .",
    "originally , the most favorable systems for the observation of the fflo phase were predicted to be clean superconducting films in the presence of an in - plane ( _ i.e. _ zeeman ) magnetic field , above the so - called clogston - chandrasekhar limit  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , despite the fact that the original prediction dates back to more than thirty years ago , the fflo phase has been very elusive to detect .",
    "the experimental realization of interacting trapped fermi gases with population imbalance  @xcite has renewed the hope of observing the fflo , thus stimulating an intense theoretical activity  @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical analysis has focused on 3d cold atomic systems . however , as in the case of solid - state superconductors , the region of phase diagram where the fflo phase has been found to be stable is quite small  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quasi - one dimensional or strongly anisotropic systems ( such as coupled chains , heavy - fermion , organic , high-@xmath5 , and @xmath6 superconductors ) are believed to be good candidates for the realization of the fflo phase  @xcite .",
    "since the dimensionality of cold atomic systems can be easily tuned , and indeed cold atoms have already been successfully trapped in 1d geometries  @xcite , it seems natural to consider these low dimensional systems as the ideal candidates to observe non - homogeneous superconductivity of the fflo type .",
    "many important results are available on the properties of spin - polarized 1d fermi systems with attractive interactions , which have been obtained by different methods and techniques .",
    "these include the bethe-_ansatz _ solutions of certain exactly solvable models like the hubbard or gaudin - yang models  @xcite , as well as different types of numerical approaches such as density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg )  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite , or field theoretical techniques like bosonization  @xcite .",
    "very recently orso  @xcite and hu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the phase diagram of harmonically - trapped 1d polarized fermi gases by combining the exact solution of the gaudin - yang model with a local - density approximation .",
    "mean - field theory has also been applied by liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , although it is known that it has a number of limitations  @xcite in 1d , particularly as far as paring correlations are concerned .",
    "dmrg has been employed by feiguin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and tezuka and ueda  @xcite , and qmc by batrouni _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to investigate the pairing correlations in the spin - polarized ground state of the attractive hubbard model in the presence of harmonic trapping .",
    "previously , yang  @xcite used bosonization to study the pairing correlations and the phase diagram of a single 1d fermi system as well as an array of weakly - coupled 1d fermi systems in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "yang s analysis is valid only close to a continuous magnetic - field - driven transition from a uniform bcs phase and an fflo phase , which he assumed to belong to the commensurate - incommensurate universality class  @xcite .",
    "another important assumption in ref .",
    "is that charge and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled at low energies for small polarization .",
    "however , this scenario does not apply to the hubbard model away from half - filling  @xcite nor to the gaudin - yang model  @xcite , which are the relevant models for current 1d cold atomic systems . as we show in this",
    "work , charge and spin degrees of freedom are indeed coupled already for small polarization , which leads to important differences as compared to the scenario described by yang .",
    "we also numerically demonstrate that the pairing correlation function exhibits prominent oscillations with a wave number equal ( up to finite size corrections , see below ) to the difference of fermi wave numbers , @xmath7 , as predicted by fflo theory in 1d  @xcite and in agreement with a number of luttinger - type theorems  @xcite .",
    "thus , the finite - wave - number oscillations in the pairing correlation function can be regarded as due to the excess of @xmath8 unpaired majority - spin fermions  @xcite .",
    "this is because in 1d the fermi wave number and the density are proportional to each other : @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", this relationship is no longer linear in dimensionality higher than one , and in this case the oscillations in the order parameter are related to the center - of - mass momentum @xmath10 of the coopers pairs .",
    "these observations seem to indicate that in the 1d case it is not entirely clear whether there is a strict close parallelism with higher dimensional fflo , and in some respects the system can be also understood as a a coupled bose - fermi mixture of spin - singlet pairs ( the bosons ) and unpaired fermions  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : model ] presents the hamiltonian that we use to describe the system of physical interest , while section  [ sect : results ] reports and discusses our main numerical results .",
    "our main conclusions are briefly reported in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "we consider a two - component mixture with a total of @xmath11 fermionic atoms loaded in a 1d optical lattice of @xmath12 sites ( the lattice constant is taken to be unity ) .",
    "the fermions are assumed to interact _ via _ attractive on - site interactions , whose strength can be tuned _",
    "e.g. _ by means of a feshbach resonance . sufficiently away from resonance(s ) , this system is modeled by the attractive hubbard model : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hopping parameter , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the creation ( destruction ) fermion operator in the @xmath17-site ( @xmath18 $ ] ) , @xmath19 the pseudospin-@xmath20 index ( in experiments this labels the two different atomic hyperfine states of the mixture ) , @xmath21 is the strength of the on - site hubbard attraction , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in order to simulate the effect of an external trapping potential ,",
    "open - boundary conditions ( obc ) breaking translational symmetry will be used ( these are indeed the most suitable conditions for the dmrg treatment of the above model  @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations are performed in the canonical ensemble , and the results apply only to lattices away from half - filling , that is , when @xmath24 . in the calculations ,",
    "the spin polarization @xmath25 was varied by decreasing @xmath26 while keeping constant the number of `` background '' up - spin atoms @xmath27 , from @xmath28 ( the unpolarized case , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 ) all the way down to @xmath30 ( the fully polarized case , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 ) .    in the unpolarized case ( @xmath32 ) , all fermions pair into spin singlets due to the attractive on - site interaction .",
    "this yields a gap to all spin excitations and therefore spin - spin correlations decay exponentially with distance .",
    "singlet superconducting and charge - density wave correlations exhibit a slower decay ( of power - law type in the ground state of a thermodynamically large system ) , being singlet superconducting correlations the ones that dominate at long distances in systems away from half - filing  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the nature of superfluidity for @xmath33 as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath34 ( in the fully polarized case , where @xmath31 , @xmath35 describes a system of @xmath36 noninteracting fermions ) .",
    "the expectation values @xmath37 of all operators below are understood to be taken over the ground state of @xmath35 .",
    "due to the obc ( or , in general , to any external potential that breaks the bloch translational invariance of the lattice ) the spin - resolved site occupation profiles , @xmath38 , exhibit friedel oscillations .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] . in the unpolarized @xmath29 case the friedel oscillations in @xmath39 are in - phase with those in @xmath40 giving rise to large - amplitude atomic - density waves  @xcite in the total site occupation @xmath41 . as it is clear from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , in the general @xmath42 case the total site occupation displays @xmath43 maxima associated with the formation of @xmath43 spin - singlet pairs that are delocalized over the lattice . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , we show the local spin polarization @xmath44 ( which could be measured through phase - sensitive optical imaging  @xcite ) . for small @xmath45 ( see _",
    "e.g. _ the plot for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) the local spin polarization displays @xmath48 maxima corresponding to the number of fermions that are left unpaired . with increasing @xmath45 though",
    "the spatial dependence of the local spin polarization becomes more complicated : the amplitude of the oscillations in the bulk becomes indeed smaller , thus making it hard to clearly identify @xmath48 maxima .",
    "these , however , are not distinctive and unambiguous signals of fflo pairing .",
    "we thus proceed below to present a study of pairing correlations : the model described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) , in fact , can not sustain any true long - range order  @xcite in 1d , _",
    "i.e. _ the ground - state expectation value of the pairing operator @xmath49 is zero .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     before concluding , we would like to illustrate the behavior of the density - density , spin - spin , and mixed density - spin static structure factors , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "these are defined by the sum over all frequencies of the corresponding dynamic structure factors  @xcite that can be in principle measured through bragg spectroscopy or fourier sampling of time - of - flight images  @xcite . in practice , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are calculated from the following equations : @xmath53\\}\\vspace{0.1 cm}\\\\ s_{mm}(k_m)&={\\rm diag}\\{{\\cal f.}{\\cal t. } [ \\langle { \\hat m}_{\\ell}{\\hat m}_{\\ell ' } \\rangle- \\langle { \\hat m}_{\\ell } \\rangle\\langle { \\hat m}_{\\ell'}\\rangle]\\}\\vspace{0.1 cm}\\\\ s_{nm}(k_m)&={\\rm diag}\\{{\\cal f.}{\\cal t. } [ \\langle { \\hat n}_{\\ell}{\\hat m}_{\\ell ' } \\rangle- \\langle { \\hat n}_{\\ell } \\rangle\\langle { \\hat m}_{\\ell'}\\rangle]\\ } \\end{array } \\right.~,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : four]-[fig : five ] we show the dependence of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 on @xmath34 for a slightly asymmetric system with @xmath46 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that in the unpolarized @xmath29 case @xmath50 has a peak at @xmath58 that signals real - space atomic - density waves  @xcite . in the spin - polarized case ,",
    "this peak splits into two peaks at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] in the static density - density structure factor ( top panel ) , which presents a double - peak structure slightly below @xmath61 ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the system parameters in this figure ) .",
    "this double - peak structure is not so visible in the magnetic structure factor @xmath51 , most likely because magnetic correlations near @xmath64 and @xmath65 are still quite suppressed by the superfluid correlations , at least in the weakly polarized case ( in the unpolarized case they are completely suppressed by the pairing gap ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] we note that @xmath52 is non - zero even at small @xmath66 , thus indicating that spin and charge degrees of freedom are coupled at long wavelength even for a small imbalance .     as a function of @xmath66 for @xmath46 and @xmath56 and different values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( from bottom to top ) .",

    "the symbol coding is as in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] . whereas the results at small @xmath34 ( see , for example filled squares corresponding to @xmath69 ) are likely to be somewhat affected by finite - size effects , which prevent the full development of a pairing gap",
    ", the results at larger @xmath70 clearly show a non - vanishing weight of @xmath52 at small @xmath66 , thus indicating that spin and charge degrees of freedom are coupled at long wavelength .",
    "[ fig : five ] ]      the most direct way to detect fflo pairing would be to measure the pairing correlation function @xmath71 .",
    "we would like to remark here that this correlation function is , at least in principle , measurable via interferometric schemes  @xcite in which two atomic wave packets are coherently extracted from the gas at different positions and then are mixed by a matter - wave beam splitter .",
    "the atom counting statistics in the beam splitter output channels has been shown  @xcite to reflect the spatial dependence of @xmath71 .",
    "the oscillations of the pairing correlations will also leave a detectable signature in the noise correlations  @xcite , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 measures the number of fermions with momentum @xmath0 and spin @xmath74 in a time - of - flight experiment . with increasing spin - polarization , in fact",
    ", the peak at @xmath75  @xcite [ here @xmath76 is the direction along the axis of the 1d system ] will shift to a finite relative momentum ( see _ e.g. _ the work by yang in ref .   and the very recent dmrg calculation by lscher _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    however , it is worth pointing out that the strength of noise signal in a strictly-1d system will be strongly affected by finite - size and temperature effects .",
    "this is because in 1d the order is not long - range but quasi - long range , and therefore the slowest decay exhibited by correlations ( like the pairing correlations ) is a power law .",
    "thus , in order to enhance the strength of the experimental signal for fflo , it would be desirable to couple many 1d systems , as in a tight 2d optical lattice ( arrays of `` atomic quantum wires '' )  @xcite , so that the quasi - long range fflo order can become true long - range order .",
    "the phase diagram of many coupled 1d systems has been worked out in ref .  , where the author found that , at small polarization @xmath45 , true long - range 3d fflo order will occur when the luttinger liquid parameter for the charge excitations , @xmath77 , is larger than @xmath78 .",
    "in such a case the low temperature properties of the system are dominated by hopping of pairs ( _ i.e. _ josephson coupling ) rather than by single - particle hopping ( the latter would turn the system into an anisotropic fermi liquid , which could in turn become unstable to the fflo state under appropriate conditions  @xcite ) .    however , the analysis of ref .   assumed the transition from the unpolarized to the polarized case to belong the the commensurate - incommensurate universality class .",
    "this assumption implicitly neglects the coupling between charge and spin degrees of freedom at low energies , which is known to modify the behavior of physical observables at the transition  @xcite . in this work",
    "this coupling has been demonstrated to exist also at long wavelengths by an explicit numerical evaluation of the mixed static structure factor @xmath52 in a weakly polarized system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] ) .",
    "thus , the phase diagram depicted in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".   seems not appropriate for coupled 1d hubbard ( or gaudin - yang  @xcite ) models , and the transition to long - range order will not take place in general for @xmath79 and may in general depend on the system parameters ( _ i.e. _ @xmath34 and the lattice filling for the hubbard model ) .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a quantitative phase diagram of coupled 1d systems lacking spin - charge separation has not yet been calculated .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that in cold atomic systems with short range interactions , another important factor must be taken into account , namely the relative strength of the pair hopping when compared to the single - particle hopping .",
    "the strength of the latter is given by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the fermi energy , for the analysis based on coupled tomonaga - luttinger liquids to hold ) , where @xmath80 is the hopping amplitude between two neighboring 1d systems .",
    "however , in absence of long - range interactions pair hopping can be only generated by ( virtual ) single - particle tunneling events , which at lowest order , yield a ( josephson ) coupling strength of order @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the spin gap .",
    "the phase diagram predicted in ref .",
    "is the result of a calculation which only compares the scaling dimensions of the pair hopping and single - particle hopping operators , and thus does not take into account the microscopic details of the coupling between 1d systems .",
    "thus , the stabilization of fflo long - range order by a weak coupling between 1d systems in the fflo phase ( the extreme anisotropic limit that could not be accessed by the authors of ref .  ) does not seem easily achievable . in turn",
    ", the most likely scenario for arbitrary polarization is that the single - particle hopping will control the physics at low temperatures , and the system will behave as a spin - polarized normal fermi liquid , which , in turn , could become unstable towards 3d fflo ordering  @xcite under appropriate conditions .",
    "in summary , we have shown how ultracold spin - polarized two - component fermi gases confined in 1d optical lattices are fflo superfluids whose pairing correlation functions are characterized by a power - law decay and a simple nodal structure .",
    "however , we have also shown that charge and spin degrees of freedom appear to be coupled already for a small value of the spin polarization .",
    "finally , we have commented on the impact of this coupling on the detectability of true long - range fflo order arising from josephson coupling between 1d systems .",

    "<S> spin - polarized attractive fermi gases in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices are expected to be remarkably good candidates for the observation of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> we model these systems with an attractive hubbard model with population imbalance . by means of the density - matrix renormalization - group method we compute the pairing correlations as well as the static spin and charge structure factors in the whole range from weak to strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that pairing correlations exhibit quasi - long range order and oscillations at the wave number expected from fflo theory . however , we also show by numerically computing the mixed spin - charge static structure factor that charge and spin degrees of freedom appear to be coupled already for small imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the consequences of this coupling for the observation of the fflo phase , as well as for the stabilization of the quasi - long range order into long - range order by coupling many identical 1d systems , as in quasi-1d optical lattices . </S>"
