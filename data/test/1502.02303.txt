    "in relatively close primordial binaries which contain at least one star that can evolve substantially by the current epoch , mass transfer from the primary to the secondary is assured .",
    "the course of the evolution of each system depends on its initial orbital period , the two stellar masses , whether the binary is part of a triple system , spin and tidal interactions , and so forth .",
    "some of the possible evolutionary channels have been explored and even systematically mapped out by rappaport et al .",

    "depending largely upon the mass ratio and the initial orbital period , the mass transfer may be stable and mostly conservative , stable and mostly non - conservative , or dynamically unstable .    in the case of a close binary that comprises a primordial primary star with mass @xmath5 and a secondary star that has @xmath6 , the mass transfer is most likely to be stable .",
    "however , depending on the ratio of thermal timescales of the two stars , the mass transfer may range from highly non - conservative for small @xmath7 ratios to mostly conservative for values of @xmath7 close to unity . whether the orbit ultimately evolves to be longer or shorter than the original orbital period depends on how much specific angular momentum is carried away with the matter ejected from the binary",
    ".    in principle",
    "the best way to model such binary evolution is via a stellar evolution code that can simultaneously handle the nuclear and mass loss / gain evolution of _ both _ stars as well as the orbital evolution .",
    "the recently developed _",
    "code ( paxton et al .  2011 ) is capable of doing such binary evolution studies , but , to our knowledge , no systematic studies have yet been carried out of ordinary close primordial binaries .",
    "we know empirically , and from some theoretical studies , that such evolution can lead to systems such as algol binaries ( see , e.g. , nelson & eggleton 2001 ) where the mass transfer is stable and the envelope of the primary has not yet been exhausted ; sdb binaries ( see , e.g. , han et al .  2002 ; 2003 ) which may have evolved from unstable mass transfer in a common envelope ; systems with hot , bloated , low - mass white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , van kerkwijk et al .  2010 ; carter et al .",
    "2011 ) , where the envelope of the primary has been completely removed ; and even double - degenerate binaries ( marsh et al .  2004",

    "2014 ) , we produced both an @xmath15 curve for the eclipses ( `` observed minus computed '' eclipse times ) as well as a folded light curve for each of the @xmath32600 cataloged _ kepler _ binaries ( matijevic et al .",

    "in addition to the four known _ kepler _ low - mass bloated hot white dwarfs , we found two others , previously unreported , in the binaries kic 9164561 and kic 10727668 .",
    "the nondegenerate components of kic 9164561 and kic 10727668 are , according to the kepler input catalog , hot with effective temperatures of @xmath38000 k and 10,000 k , respectively , and thus are not susceptible to the starspot modulations that are exhibited by cooler stars .",
    "an examination of the fourier transform of the kic 10727668 flux time series shows no evidence for any periodicities , including those from stellar pulsations , other than that of the orbit . in the case of kic 9164561 ,",
    "the fourier transform of the flux time series shows a set of pulsations at frequencies @xmath17 cycles / day , which does not significantly affect our light curve or timing analysis .",
    "we therefore made no corrections to the data except for normalizing each quarter to its median value .",
    "the orbital periods given in the _ kepler _ binary catalog ( matijevic et al .  2012 ; kirk et al .",
    "2015 ) were used to produce initial folds of the data . from these folds",
    ", we established a trial template for the orbital light curve .",
    "this profile was then used to fit each individual eclipse in the time series , thereby determining a set of 893 and 108 eclipse times for kic 9164561 and 10727668 , respectively .",
    "we then fit a linear function to the sequence of eclipse times of the form : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the nth eclipse .",

    "the periods and their uncertainties for these two systems are listed in table [ tab : sys ] .",

    "the data for both kic 9164561 and kic 10727668 were folded at the orbital periods we determined from fitting the individual eclipses , as described above .",
    "the results were averaged into 3-minute bins , and are shown in figures [ fig:916 ] and [ fig:107 ] .    due to the small curvature observed in the eclipse timing residuals for kic 9164561 ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : third ] ) we removed a quadratic term from the eclipse phases before producing the folded light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:916 ] . the phase corrections amount to less than 0.002 days ( or 0.0016 orbital cycles ) .    in each case , the light curves are normalized to unity at the bottom of the deeper eclipse when the hot white dwarf has been totally eclipsed .",
    "this is then the light level of the primary a star at a minimum of its ellipsoidal variations .",
    "the relatively small separation of the two components of kic 9164561 is manifest by the short orbital period , the large amplitude of the ellipsoidal light variations ( `` elv '' ) , and the duration of the eclipse relative to the orbital period .",
    "the light curves of these two binaries were analyzed with a relatively simple geometrical model which involves 13 free parameters . in brief",
    ", there are 7 free parameters associated with the eclipses : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , two limb - darkening coefficients , and @xmath24 , where subscript `` 1 '' refers to the primary a star , @xmath25 is the orbital separation , @xmath22 the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath24 , the time of the middle of a primary eclipse .",
    "the out - of - eclipse phases are fitted with a set of 6 terms , i.e. , a sine and a cosine term for each of the orbital frequency and its next two higher harmonics .",
    "each of these can be associated with different contributions to the elvs , the illumination term , and the doppler boosting effect , as described in some detail in carter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",

    "the initial hydrogen abundance ( by mass ) of the progenitor star while on the zams is taken to be equal to 0.71 and the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale - height ratio ( @xmath255 ) is set equal to 1.5 .",
    "the initial orbital separation was carefully selected so that only very low mass helium wds were created .",
    "diffusion ( gravitational settling and radiative levitation ) was not included in the computations because diffusion is a very fragile physical process that can be negated by turbulence in the outer layers of these rapidly rotating ( proto-)white dwarf stars .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of diffusion has little effect on the cooling times for the models of interest ( i.e. , bloated helium wds ) because these systems are very young and have not even evolved to reach their maximum surface temperatures before joining the usual wd cooling track in the hr diagram .",
    "it is only after the wds have passed through their maximum @xmath45 that the compression of the outer hydrogen - rich layers , due to contraction , can cause the residual hydrogen to start to burn , leading to a rapid expansion of the outer layers as a result of a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cooling ] , we show the results of the cooling evolution of several models that have masses near or smaller than the tnr lower mass limit , i.e. , @xmath256 .",
    "the evolution of the radius of the wd is shown as a function of its effective temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "when the envelope of the progenitor giant collapses , the radius of the proto - wd continually decreases , as long as no tnrs occur , until it asymptotically reaches its zero - temperature radius .",
    "the surface temperature of the object initially increases ( this increasing temperature defines the proto - wd phase ) until it reaches a maximum value of @xmath45 where it then follows a cooling track and asymptotically approaches zero temperature .    assuming that the white dwarfs in both kic 9164561 and kic 10727668 formed according to the scenario discussed above",
    ", we can infer reasonably precise values of the mass based on the observed radii and @xmath45 values superposed on the cooling tracks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] ) .",
    "we find that the mass of the wd in kic 9164561 is @xmath257 , and that of the wd in kic 10727668 is @xmath258 .",
    "these masses agree with those inferred from the cooling evolutions of althaus et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to within 5 to 10% ( their values of the mass being smaller ) , and to within @xmath259% for the values inferred from the work of istrate et al .",
    "we also carried out this same type of wd cooling calculations with the mesa code ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) and found very similar results .",
    "the ages of these objects as measured from the cessation of mass transfer are approximately 925 myr and 950 myr , respectively .",
    "if the companion star in kic 9164561 has a mass of @xmath260 , then the time required to reduce its average density to the inferred value of 0.17 g @xmath42 is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for the evolution of a solar metallicity star .",
    "the orbital period predicted by our models is approximately 1.7 days , but it should be noted that our assumptions about the degree of mass conservation during the mass - transfer phase and the magnitude of angular momentum losses leading to the formation of the giant are not precisely known , and this uncertainty could have a significant impact on the final value of the orbital period . as for kic 10727668 ,",
    "the predicted orbital period from our models almost matches the observed one .",
    "however , the predicted age and somewhat higher mass of the companion star are very problematic because the observationally inferred average density implies that the companion star has not significantly evolved from its initial position on the zams .",
    "based on the implied cooling age of the system and a mass of 2.2 @xmath0 , we would expect the star to be much closer to the tams with a correspondingly lower density ( contrary to what is implied in figure 3 ) . if the mass of the companion were substantially less ( say , @xmath671.7 @xmath0 ) , then a wd composed primarily of helium and with a mass of @xmath261 would be entirely compatible with the observations .",
    "based on the cooling evolution , we conclude that the theoretical models for the evolution of kic 9164561 lead to properties that agree well with the observationally inferred properties .",
    "the predictions for kic 10727668 are problematic , especially given the implied cooling age of the white dwarf in the system .",
    "for an age in the range of 100200 myr , a white dwarf mass of @xmath262 ( inferred from the doppler boosting effect ; see sect .",
    "[ sec : db ] ) , and @xmath263 , it is very difficult to model the properties with any type of solar metallicity hewd . to understand why this is true , consider the evolutionarily limiting case for which all of the hydrogen has been stripped from the atmosphere and envelope of the hewd .",
    "based on the wd cooling tracks of nelson & davis ( 2000 ) , a 0.27 @xmath0 wd of this type can reach a temperature of 14,000k at either of two ages : ( i ) considerably less than 10 myr ; or , ( ii ) @xmath264 myr .",
    "the luminosity of the wd for the latter case is two orders of magnitude smaller than what is inferred ( see table [ tab : sys ] ) and can be automatically ruled out . for the other solution ( corresponding to the early - wd phase before the maximum @xmath45 is reached ) ,",
    "the luminosity is approximately correct but a cooling age of only several million years after the birth of the wd seems to be unacceptably small based on probability arguments .",
    "if a thick layer of hydrogen were to be added to the envelope , the cooling would be slowed but incompatibilities with the observations would persist .",
    "for example , the luminosity of the hewd while it is still young would be considerably higher and it would likely undergo a tnr . perhaps we are observing the hewd while it is undergoing one of its tnr cycles ; the probability of observing it at this epoch may be unacceptably small .",
    "another possible explanation might be a difference in the actual metallicity from that which we assumed ; however , making the metallicity smaller generally makes the incompatibilities larger .",
    "thus if the mass of the wd in kic 10727668 is actually about 0.27 @xmath0 , then it might have been derived from a higher mass progenitor ( @xmath265 ) or perhaps via a different evolutionary pathway than we have considered here .",
    "we plan to investigate all of these possibilities in a future paper .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we have included the robust measurements of effective temperatures and radii of eight other eclipsing or tidally distorted , extremely - low mass wds ( found in double degenerate systems ; see hermes et al .",
    "the observations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] as open blue circles .",
    "it should be noted that these additional wds have properties that are reasonably similar to the six hot wds found by kepler except that they are typically less bloated .",
    "based on the cooling models , we expect the masses of all of these systems to reside in the range of 0.15 - 0.25 @xmath0 , which is generally consistent with the values reported in hermes et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . finally , in this regard , we note that these white dwarfs have a very different evolutionary scenario from the systems examined in our work in that they are likely the result of two common - envelope episodes .      here",
    "we examine very briefly what the future holds for systems such as koi 74 , koi 81 , koi 1224 , koi 1375 , kic 9164561 , and kic 10727668 .",
    "when these systems evolve to the point where the primary a star fills its roche lobe and commences mass transfer onto the white dwarf , their he core masses will range from 0.19 to 0.27@xmath266 for the shortest ( kic 9164561 ) and longest ( koi 81 ) orbital periods of these systems , respectively ( as estimated using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mwd_p2 ] ) ) .",
    "once the mass transfer onto the white dwarf begins , it will be dynamically unstable due to the very large mass ratio ( typically 10:1 ) , and a common envelope will ensue . using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ce ] ) , we can compute an approximate expression for the ratio of the final orbital separation to the initial orbital separation , and we find : @xmath267 where @xmath8 is the mass of the hot white dwarfs being studied in these systems , @xmath222 and @xmath221 will be the envelope and core mass of the a star when it evolves to fill its roche lobe , @xmath268 , @xmath240 is the common envelope parameter of order unity discussed above , and @xmath269 is the roche - lobe radius of the a star in units of the orbital separation ( with an expected numerical value of @xmath270 ) .    if we apply eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : aoai ] ) to estimate the final orbital separation that will result from this upcoming common envelope phase , we find that @xmath271 .",
    "the current orbital separations of the six bloated hot white dwarfs in the _ kepler _ field range from 6.4 to 48@xmath272 . from this",
    "we can infer that the final orbital separations will be @xmath273 , for kic 9164561 to koi 81 , respectively .",
    "all of these will be binaries comprised of two roughly equal mass white dwarfs each of @xmath274 , if the core of the a star does not merge with the initial low - mass white dwarf in the system .",
    "the corresponding orbital periods and roche - lobe radii would range from 3/4 to 14 min , and @xmath275 , respectively .",
    "all but the largest of these roche - lobe radii are too small to harbor the white dwarf cores that will be unveiled by the common envelope .",
    "thus , we conclude that the orbital periods of the group of double degenerate systems recently studied by brown et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and hermes et al .",
    "( 2014 ) result from much wider systems .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that the masses of the primary in the double degenerate binaries in the latter studies are typically much more massive than would result from the six binaries containing bloated hot white dwarfs in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "in this study we report two new low - mass , thermally bloated , hot white dwarfs in binary systems with companion a stars .",
    "the systems are similar in their basic nature to those in koi 74 , koi 81 , koi 1224 , and koi 1375 .",
    "this brings to six the total number of such systems in the _ kepler _ field . of the six systems , the two new systems have the shortest orbital periods at 1.27 d and 2.3 d , while kic 9164561 has the largest , i.e. , the most thermally bloated , of the six white dwarfs",
    "its white dwarf has a radius that is 14 times larger than its fully degenerate radius  it is more than 1/2 @xmath116 in _ diameter _ !",
    "the mass of the white dwarf in kic 9164561 is 0.197 @xmath31 0.005 @xmath0 and is determined from direct rv measurements of the primary a star as well as some inferences about the mass of the a star ( i.e. , the mean density and @xmath45 lead to an estimate for @xmath123 ) . by contrast , the mass of the white dwarf in kic 10727668 is more uncertain at 0.27 @xmath31 0.03 @xmath0 . since there are no rv measurements of this fainter system , we relied on measurements of the doppler boosting effect to determine the orbital velocity of the a star .",
    "the accuracy of this latter mass is not quite sufficient for detailed comparisons with binary evolution or white - dwarf cooling models .",
    "we strongly advocate that a larger telescope be used to determine an accurate rv for this system .",
    "binary evolution scenarios involving two low - mass , e.g. , @xmath67 1.1 and 1.5 @xmath0 , primordial stars that undergo stable , conservative mass transfer can nicely explain the current mass and evolutionary state of both the companion star and the hot white dwarf in kic 9164561 .",
    "for this system , we estimate an age of @xmath3925 myr since the envelope of the white dwarf progenitor was transferred to the current a star .",
    "by contrast , it is more difficult to explain the current state of both the a star and its white dwarf companion in kic 10727668 .",
    "if the white dwarf actually has a mass as high as is indicated by the doppler boosting technique ( i.e. , 0.27 @xmath0 ) then it is difficult to understand how the white dwarf can still be so thermally bloated . if , on the other hand , we take the uncertainty seriously , and allow for a mass as low as , say , 0.22 @xmath0 , then there is still a discrepancy between the inferred cooling age of @xmath67 950 myr , and the apparent location of the a star in the hr diagram which is still near the zams .",
    "the growing statistical ensemble of these systems should make it worthwhile to ( 1 ) make renewed attempts to measure the rvs in four of the remaining bloated hot white dwarf systems in order to better determine @xmath8 , and ( 2 ) directly model the binary evolution of such systems with a code that can evolve two stars _ simultaneously _",
