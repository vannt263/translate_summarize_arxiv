    "the response of vacuum to classical external fields or constraints has been studied since more than fifty years .",
    "the manifestation of this response are macroscopic forces exerted on boundaries or surfaces where the potential is concentrated .",
    "the most famous example is the casimir effect @xcite , which has been recently measured in laboratory with a precision of nearly @xmath0 @xcite . notwithstanding",
    "the large size of theoretical work and the experimental efforts many question remain still open .",
    "we have in fact by this far no exact knowledge of the law governing the sign of the casimir energy , how exactly the features of the boundary and its geometry influence the response of vacuum .",
    "an investigation on the cylindrical geometry has begun in @xcite after the suggestion that a cylinder , as a kind of intermediate shape between the parallel plates and the sphere , could possess a zero casimir stress @xcite .",
    "however paper @xcite showed that a perfectly conducting cylinder in the electromagnetic vacuum has a negative casimir energy .",
    "a study of the dielectric cylinder has been recently carried out in @xcite and in @xcite , with the interesting result of a vanishing vacuum energy in the dilute case .",
    "some light could be further shed into the problem with the study of other quantum fields and other types of background potentials . in this paper",
    "we investigate a cylindrical shell with radius @xmath1 , having a delta function @xmath2 as a potential profile .",
    "a delta function is an idealization of a strongly concentrated potential . unlike the case of dirichlet",
    "boundary conditions the field is continuous on the surface of the shell , therefore the delta function represents a model for a boundary which is not completely hard , but which becomes transparent at high frequencies .",
    "this model can be considered as the `` scalar '' version of the dielectric background .",
    "a non singular potential would be , of course , more realistic under the physical point of view , but the calculations would be considerably more complicated . a calculation with the delta function has been already carried out for a spherical shell @xcite and for a magnetic flux tube in the vacuum of spinor and scalar fields @xcite .",
    "we hope that our work can contribute in the understanding of vacuum as a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory .",
    "the cylindrical shell could , besides , find physical applications in the calculation of the quantum corrections to vortices in qcd or in the electroweak theory .",
    "another interesting perspective is in the recent discovery of the so called nanotubes @xcite , @xcite , which are large carbon molecules generated in laboratory offering the intriguing possibility of measuring quantum effects on small cylindrical objects .",
    "it is also of interest the comparison of the problem of the cylindrical shell with the analogous problem of the magnetic flux tube @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow : in the next section we collect the basic formulas necessary for the calculation and we present the renormalization procedure , in section 3 and 4 the major part of the analytical calculation is performed . in section 5",
    "the numerical results are given and in section 6 these results are briefly discussed .",
    "let us work with a real massive scalar field @xmath3 with mass @xmath4 and let us quantize it in the background of a cylindrical potential .",
    "the field equation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 , after separation of the variables , reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the momentum four vector being @xmath8 its component along the longitudinal axis of the cylinder and @xmath9 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "@xmath10 is the background potential given by @xmath11 it represents an infinitely thin cylindrical shell whose profile is a delta function .",
    "the shell has a circular section of radius @xmath1 and it extends from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "@xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter giving the strength of the potential .    considering eq.(1 ) as a scattering problem",
    ", we choose the `` regular solution '' which is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a bessel function of the first kind , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hankel functions of the first and of the second kind and the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are a jost function and its complex conjugate respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is a theta function .",
    "the field is therefore free in the regions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . at @xmath26",
    "the field is continuous and we have the following matching conditions @xmath27 where the prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "+ the quantum field is in its vacuum state , its energy is given by half of the sum over all possible eigenvalues @xmath29 of the hamilton operator related with the wave equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we define a regularized vacuum energy @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the regularization parameter which we will put to zero after the renormalization , @xmath32 is a mass parameter introduced for dimensional reasons and @xmath33 includes all possible quantum numbers .",
    "we will calculate the energy density per unit length of the cylinder given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of the operator contained in ( 1 ) without @xmath8 and with @xmath36 .",
    "we carry out the integration over @xmath8 and we arrive at @xmath37 following a well known procedure we transform the sum in ( 7 ) into a contour integral and , dropping the minkowski space contribution , we find @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the jost function defined in ( 3 ) on the imaginary axis .",
    "it contains all the information about the background potential under examination .",
    "we will find @xmath41 explicitly in the following section .",
    "the energy defined in ( 8) is renormalized by direct subtraction of its divergent part @xmath42 with the normalization condition demanding that the vacuum fluctuations vanish for a field of infinite mass @xmath43 this normalization condition fixes the arbitrariness of the mass parameter @xmath32 ( for more details see @xcite",
    ". the condition does not apply to massless fields ) .",
    "the isolation of @xmath44 is done with the use the heat - kernel expansion of the ground state energy @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are the heat kernel coefficients related to the background",

    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 contain all the pole terms ( all the divergences of the vacuum energy ) plus the terms proportional to non - negative powers of the mass ( which do not satisfy the normalization condition ) .",
    "all these terms are subtracted and are used to calculate the heat - kernel coefficients by means of definition ( 12 ) for @xmath44 .",
    "below we give the heat kernel coefficients which we calculated up to the coefficient @xmath87 ( adding four more orders in @xmath88 ) , in the hope that they will be of use for future investigations on the same background @xmath89 one can note how all the integer heat - kernel coefficients depend on odd powers of the coupling constant , while the half - integer coefficients depend on even powers of @xmath15 .",
    "the same feature is present in the heat kernel coefficients of a @xmath90-potential spherical shell @xcite .",
    "we perform the subtraction of the divergent portion and we obtain the final result @xmath91",
    "the quantity ( 27 ) can not be analytically simplified . we integrate @xmath92 and @xmath77 by parts and make the substitution @xmath93 to get an explicit dependence on @xmath1 @xmath94 for small values of @xmath1 , @xmath95 behaves like @xmath96 , while @xmath77 has a logarithmic behaviour @xmath97 we note that in the limit @xmath98 , the logarithm of the jost function @xmath40 can be expanded in powers of @xmath15 , giving ( from eq.(19 ) ) @xmath99 then , the summation over @xmath9 of the leading term of this expansion could be analytically performed following a method recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "this would give us a first order approximation of @xmath100 .",
    "however we will restrict us here to a numerical calculation of the sum in ( 34 ) , which can be performed for small as well as for large values of @xmath15 .    to find the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath101 we rewrite eq.(33 ) in the following form @xmath102\\ , \\ ] ] where the functions @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by @xmath106 as mentioned above , the functions @xmath84 are quickly converging integrals .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath107 is governed by the functions @xmath108 and by the value of @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath109 we find @xmath110 thus , for small values of the radius , @xmath107 is proportional to @xmath111 . summing the contribution coming from ( 35 ) and ( 38 )",
    ", we find that the leading term of the renormalized energy , for @xmath109 , is @xmath112 this result is in agreement with the prediction ( section ii of paper @xcite ) @xmath113 in the limit @xmath114 the behaviour of the renormalized energy is determined by the first non - vanishing heat kernel coefficient after @xmath115 . from ( 32 ) and eq.(11 ) we arrive at @xmath116    we have numerically evaluated the quantities @xmath107 , @xmath95 , @xmath117 and @xmath58 as functions of @xmath1 , fixing the values of the mass to @xmath118 .",
    "it turned out to be necessary to sum 20 terms in the variable @xmath9 and to integrate up to 1000 in the variable @xmath119 to obtain `` stable '' numerical values for the energy .",
    "below we give the plots of the various contributions to the vacuum energy and the complete renormalized energy for different values of the potential strength .",
    "for @xmath120 we found the renormalized vacuum energy to posses a small imaginary part becoming larger when @xmath15 approaches @xmath12 .",
    "particle creation accounts for this contribution .",
    "it starts when the attractive potential of the shell becomes over - critical , that is when @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the energy of the bound state ; in this case the effective action of the system acquires an imaginary part , however a detailed discussion of this aspect of the theory is beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "it should only be said that in the plots traced for negative values of @xmath15 ( fig . 4 and 5 ) the energy is to be intended as real part of .",
    "we calculated the vacuum energy of a scalar field in the background of a cylindrical semi - transparent shell .",
    "the formulas for the energy density per unit length of the shell are given by equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) .",
    "the heat kernel coefficients ( 32 ) for a cylindrical potential containing a delta function , are also a relevant part of the results .",
    "a discussion of the sign of the vacuum energy is possible by means of the data given in the numerical section of this paper .",
    "the energy is found to be negative in the background of repulsive potentials ( @xmath123 ) for every finite value of the radius ( fig .",
    "3 ) . this conclusion sets a closeness between the model studied here and that of a conducting cylinder @xcite and of a dielectric cylinder @xcite in the electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "the latter models possess also a negative casimir energy .",
    "there is also a resemblance with the @xmath90-potential spherical shell investigated in paper @xcite , where a negative energy was observed for large repulsive potentials .    in the background of attractive potentials ( @xmath124 )",
    "the energy is negative on almost all the @xmath1-axis . as we see in fig .",
    "5 , the energy becomes positive for very small values of the radius .",
    "this happens when the logarithmic term in ( 39 ) compensates for the term proportional to @xmath125 in ( 41 ) which is dominant for small values of @xmath15 in the region @xmath126 .",
    "the thin region of positive asymptotically increasing energy appearing in fig .",
    "5 is reasonably out of physical applicability . for both repulsive and attractive potentials the renormalized vacuum energy of the semi - transparent cylinder goes logarithmically to @xmath127 in the limit @xmath109",
    "this logarithmic behaviour was also found in the semi - transparent spherical shell @xcite , however it was not found in the @xmath90-potential flux tube @xcite , which has many feature in common with the background investigated here .",
    "this can be explained by means of the heat - kernel coefficient @xmath115 , which is a non zero coefficient here as well as in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note how in expression ( 32 ) for the coefficient @xmath115 the contributions proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath128 have cancelled and only a term proportional to @xmath129 is present .",
    "the cancellation of the lower powers of the potential strength was also observed in @xcite and in paper @xcite , where a theta function profile in a dielectric spherical shell is examined .",
    "it confirms the observation that singular profiles show weaker divergences than smoother , less singular profiles .",
