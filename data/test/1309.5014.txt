    "the electoral campaign is a period preceding elections where political parties do an organized effort so that their candidates garner supporters .",
    "maximizing the influence of their messages over voters is the main objective . in this way",
    ", politicians use different techniques to transmit their messages in the most effective way to their potential voters , such as mass meetings , rallies , husting or media management . understanding and exploiting in a more efficient way the available resources for information flow than your opponent can make the difference .    over the last century mass media has been monopolized by old media , such as televisions or newspapers .",
    "however nowadays we are attending to a transition where a new interactive online social media world is settling its bases .",
    "online social networks , such as twitter with over 200 million users , have become ideal platforms for information flows .",
    "this has been noted in @xcite where they reported that these tools may serve as a framework for discussion .",
    "other studies have been directed towards identifying influential users @xcite or discovering its commercial usage @xcite . moreover",
    "the percentage of population using online social networks has increased in recent years , reaching in spain a @xmath0 of the population , quantity that is almost duplicated ( @xmath1 ) for young adults between 18 - 29 years old @xcite .",
    "following the idea one must be where people are , politicians are now present in the most popular online social networks .",
    "however some politicians do not have a defined strategy for the usage of these tools and the rest are still far of exploiting all the available potential .",
    "the importance and popularity of social media in politics became clear with obama s campaign for the 2008 u.s .",
    "presidential elections and his famous tweet : `` this is history ... '' , posted just after winning the elections .",
    "this fact attracted not only popular , but also scientific attention , making political conversations in twitter a popular subject for research . lately",
    ", the data gathered from twitter has been used as a social sensor to predict election outcomes @xcite .",
    "other studies have focused in analyzing the interactions between different political communities @xcite , and finally a proof - of - concept - model has been developed @xcite to predict candidate s victory .    in this article",
    "we introduce a new parameter that measures the ratio of the support in twitter between two candidates , which we call the relative support , and apply it to the 2011 spanish presidential elections , to show how it can be used to indicate and quantify which candidate and in which proportion is getting more benefits from events occurring offline .",
    "we further study the dynamical patterns emergent from the twitter mention and retweet networks within the framework of complex networks theory @xcite .",
    "we also interpret politicians behavior by filtering these networks and analyzing the interactions going on between the different political parties .",
    "finally we introduce a model based on the heterogeneous preferential attachment formalism @xcite capable of growing political conversations and illustrate it by reproducing the mentions and retweets taking place in twitter among politicians .",
    "the present work is based on data collected from the online social network twitter .",
    "this web application allows people to post and exchange text messages limited by @xmath2 characters .",
    "there are several interaction mechanisms in twitter to transfer information .",
    "the first of these is the ability of people to follow and be followed by other users .",
    "this is a passive mechanism that allows users to receive the messages written by their followees in real time .",
    "the twitter s followers network is a directed graph where non reciprocal relations are admitted and it states the social substratum through which information may flow .",
    "previous studies have reported a high heterogeneity in the followers distribution @xcite .",
    "another important mechanism to interact is the retweet or message retransmission .",
    "this mechanism allows individual messages to propagate throughout the network and serves as a way for people to endorse their point of view over specific subjects @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , another relevant way for direct interaction is the mentions mechanism . by mentioning someone s username in the message text ,",
    "people is able to send directed messages to the mentioned user s inbox .",
    "this mechanism is often used to establish conversations between users , through the exchange of messages , or just to refer somebody in the message s text @xcite .",
    "our dataset is constructed from public access messages posted in twitter , related to the 2011 spanish presidential elections .",
    "we downloaded all the messages that included the keyword _",
    "20n _ , using the twitter api interface , in a three week period including the election day .",
    "we chose this keyword because is an ideologically neutral identifier , used by all the political parties during the campaign and voting day . in summary",
    "we analyzed over 370.000 messages , written by over 100.000 users .",
    "we found that @xmath3 of the messages were retweets , and over @xmath4 contained at least one mention .",
    "this fact makes the event quite relevant , since it has been reported that retweets represent about @xmath5 of the overall messages @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to further explain the structural features found in the interactions between politicians , we propose a model based on the heterogeneous preferential attachment formalism @xcite .",
    "the idea behind it , is that the probability of a node @xmath6 interacting with a node @xmath7 not only depends on their respective degree , but also of the affinity between them . in our model nodes ( politicians )",
    "are classified according to discrete characteristics ( political parties ) .",
    "thus the probability of appearance of a new interaction from any politician , @xmath6 , belonging to party @xmath8 , to a politician @xmath7 , who belongs to a party @xmath9 , is given by the following expression : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath7s strength , and @xmath12 , is the affinity value from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the first factor of equation [ number political interactions ] corresponds to the local connection at microscale , and the second one to the mesoscale .",
    "we implement this model in the mesoscale by grouping all the politicians of the same party in a supernode labeled with the name of the party .",
    "the properties of these supernodes are determined by those of the nodes inside them , and the number of interactions , @xmath13 , between them can be obtained from the @xmath14 matrix @xcite . in this way",
    "the affinity value between two politicians will be determined only by their political parties .",
    "we represent the directional affinity between political parties by an @xmath15 matrix whose elements quantify the relative flux of interactions from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . using this notation we can model",
    "the structure of the @xmath15 matrix as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total flux going from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath18 is the total flux going out from a. after understanding the structure of the system s mesoscale , its time to model the microscale . in this scale",
    "the probability rule for interactions between politicians is based on the preferential attachment model @xcite . in the sense that the likelihood of a node , belonging to party @xmath9 , to receive a new interaction , increases with the nodes strength .        to implement the model we have calculated the experimental @xmath15 matrix of each network , considering only those parties with over 10 politicians participating in the conversation .",
    "also we have assigned a random number of outgoing edges to the newly added nodes , following power law distributions of exponents : @xmath19 for the mention network and @xmath20 for the retweets one . in this way we modeled the resulting distributions by simulating the heterogeneity found in the users behavior and using the same microscale connection rule for both interaction mechanisms . in figure [ modelo ]",
    "we present the resulting cumulative strength function distribution for both networks , after having averaged over @xmath21 realizations .",
    "it can be noticed that the model reproduces perfectly the strength function distribution for both networks , and maintains the assortative mixing levels as presented in table [ netproppolit ] .",
    "the perfect political campaign strategy has been eternally chased by politicians . to that effect",
    "we have tracked voter sentiment and uncovered the underlying structure of the campaign in twitter , measuring the impact that different events have produced on politicians popularity and analyzing the roles played by the various users .",
    "for this matter , in this paper we propose a parameter that measures the relative support in twitter between two candidates , and apply it to our case of study : the 2011 spanish presidential elections .",
    "furthermore we have analyzed the graph structural and dynamical patterns emergent from interactions taking place among users , finding out that the collective attention is driven by a very small fraction of users , who dominate the interaction mechanisms .",
    "we have also analyzed politicians behavior finding a profound segregation and lack of debate among them .",
    "finally we propose a network growth model based on heterogeneous preferential attachment , to explain the emergence of such segregated modules in the politician s networks . despite we",
    "ca nt assure that the campaign on twitter determined the election outcomes , our results suggest that there is a strong correlation between the activity taking place in twitter and election results .",
    "this fact suggests that further research should be done on identifying the most efficient techniques to influence voter sentiment in twitter .",
