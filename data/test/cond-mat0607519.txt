    "the many - body potential energy surface can be approximated quite accurately by a sum of two - body potentials . the interaction strength @xmath7 of the @xmath1-body system is then determined by the underlying two - body potential and , assuming @xmath1 identical mass @xmath8 particles , the mass @xmath8 . the critical coupling constant @xmath6 , for which the @xmath1-body cluster becomes unbound , defines the threshold .",
    "this paper investigates the near - threshold regime of bosonic three - dimensional @xmath1-body clusters , i.e. , the regime where @xmath9 .",
    "this near - threshold regime is particularly interesting since some properties of the bosonic many - body system become independent of the details of the underlying potential energy surface , i.e. , some properties of weakly - bound clusters consisting of @xmath1 bosons become universal as @xmath10  @xcite .",

    "we believe , however , that advances in the theoretical understanding , including predictions derived using effective theories and zero - range models  @xcite , and in the numerical treatment make it worthwhile to revisit the characterization of weakly - bound three - dimensional clusters .",
    "in particular , we present more accurate energies for a larger range of coupling strengths and for a larger range of cluster sizes than previous studies .    the present study is additionally motivated by recent experiments on extremely weakly - bound molecules created from ultracold bose and fermi gases . utilizing feshbach resonances the effective interaction strength between two atoms at ultracold temperatures can be changed essentially at will through application of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this external knob has led to the observation of extremely weakly - bound diatomic molecules in highly - excited vibrational states  @xcite and provided evidence for the formation of efimov trimer states  @xcite in an ultracold environment .",

    "feshbach resonances arise from the coupling of two born - oppenheimer potential curves through a hyperfine hamiltonian and require , in general , a multi - channel description . in the case of a broad resonance ,",

    "as alluded to in the introduction , the coupling strength can be varied experimentally via a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "although a full description of a feshbach resonance requires the coupling between at least two channels in tritium , e.g. , of the singlet and triplet potential curves ( coupled through a long - range hyperfine hamiltonian )  @xcite , some properties can be described within a single channel model .",
    "we thus envision that changing the atom mass in our single channel treatment can be mapped to changing the strength of an external magnetic field , and hence of the atom - atom scattering length , in the vicinity of a two - body feshbach resonance .",
