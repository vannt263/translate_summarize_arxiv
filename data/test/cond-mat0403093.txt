    "understanding the physics of the hubbard model continues to be a fundamental issue in strongly correlated systems .",
    "this model captures the transition between a metallic state and a correlated insulator ; how this transition takes place has been investigated by many workers in the past , with differing approaches emphasizing the formation of hubbard bands ,  @xcite the increasing mass of the quasiparticles  @xcite and the proximity to antiferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite significant progress has been made in recent years by the development of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite here a set of equations ",
    "exact in the limit of infinite dimensions  is derived which maps the problem onto an interacting impurity model to be solved self - consistently .",
    "this method has revealed a mott transition that is a synthesis of the pictures of mott and brinkman  rice : formation of hubbard bands in parallel with a large mass quasiparticle .",
    "the absence of momentum dependence in correlations within dmft means that this method does not account for variations in quasiparticle properties across the brillouin zone .",
    "this is likely to be important if the mott transition has an antiferromagnetic aspect .",
    "building on the success of dynamical mean - field theory , extensions to the theory are being actively studied .",
    "one such extension combines it with density - functional theory to improve the treatment of local correlations .",
    "@xcite another considers intersite correlations via so called cluster dmft .",
    "@xcite it is also often important to include multiple local orbitals when modeling real materials such as the correlated oxides . in all of these extensions",
    "the task of solving the resulting self - consistent equations becomes increasingly problematic : the equations require the solution of impurity models with an increasing number of local degrees of freedom , which often demand high - performance computing resources and sophisticated approximation schemes to extract the low energy physics .    yet in contrast to these computationally intensive approaches , potthoff  @xcite demonstrated that much of the mott transition physics could be captured with a drastic approximation of the non - interacting bath of electrons that couples to the impurity in dmft .",
    "whereas in one computational scheme for tackling the dmft equations , the bath is modeled by up to twelve coupled sites ( the exact diagonalization method  @xcite ) , potthoff used just a single site to represent the bath .",
    "the self - consistency conditions were constructed to ensure that the quasiparticle properties and band filling were matched . solving them yielded a successful description of the mott transition showing , for example , the narrowing of the quasiparticle resonance and the formation of the hubbard bands .",
    "a value of the critical hubbard interaction , @xmath1 , was obtained comparable to the best calculations .    in this paper",
    "we present an extension of potthoff s `` two - site '' approach to treat cluster dmft .",
    "we use our method to investigate the approach to the mott transition for a single band hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice with nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we study this model as an example case , although our method is readily extended to more complicated hamiltonians .",
    "the method allows us to quickly investigate the zero temperature phase diagram across a large range of parameter space using a desktop computer .",
    "the efficacy of our approach is reinforced by our results which are consistent with other results in the literature for the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "moreover we can go beyond existing work to study the quasiparticle properties in momentum space : seeing , for example , how an electron - like metal ( well away from half - filling ) becomes a hole - like doped mott insulator near half - filling .",
    "some of our results are suggestive of the physics of the cuprate superconductors with the appearance of pseudogap regions and `` arc - like '' fermi surfaces brought about , in our case , by the combination of antiferromagnetism and proximity to a van hove point .",
    "we also observe a fermi surface distortion resulting from a pomeranchuk instability also reported elsewhere in the literature.@xcite physically , this is due to the proximity of the fermi surface to the van hove point , but the tendency will be exaggerated in our model due to the reduced symmetry of our cluster ( see later ) .",
    "we begin with a summary of dmft together with potthoff s `` two - site '' approach .",
    "we then discuss how dmft can be extended to a cluster of sites , and describe our application of potthoff s approach to a cluster consisting of a pair of sites .",
    "we then demonstrate this method on the 2d hubbard model and present our results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the physics behind these results and future extensions of our method .",
    "the dmft procedure  @xcite can be described as follows .",
    "we focus on a single site of the hubbard model , and notionally integrate out all the other sites .",
    "this gives an effective action for the remaining site of the form @xmath5 the function @xmath6 completely encapsulates the dynamics of electrons entering and leaving the site from the rest of the lattice ; however it is not known _ a priori _ since we can not in practice integrate out the other sites . with this action we could determine the interacting green s function @xmath7 , and extract a local self - energy from the dyson s equation @xmath8 the dmft ansatz , exact in infinite dimensions , is to use this local self - energy as a spatially homogeneous ( but frequency - dependent ) self - energy for the full lattice problem : @xmath9 the self - consistency requirement that the on - site green s function of the extended lattice ( containing the self - energy ) is the same as the local green s function we started with , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 provides the constraint on the unknown initial function @xmath11 , thereby completing the self - consistency loop .",
    "[ dmftseff ] is the effective action of a single interacting impurity coupled to a continuum bath , but the procedure described above can not be achieved exactly because the single site impurity problem with an unrestricted bath is still intractable .",
    "one must approximate and use a model that is practically solvable ; for example , a finite - sized impurity model for exact diagonalization ,  @xcite or a discretized effective action for quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "@xcite this means that only limited functional forms of @xmath11 can be represented , and also that the final self - consistency condition can not be implemented precisely .    in the `` two - site '' realization of dmft introduced by potthoff ,  @xcite the local model is an impurity site together with a bath consisting of",
    "_ a single site only _ , with a hamiltonian : @xmath12 where the electron creation operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 are for the impurity site and the bath site respectively .",
    "diagonalizing the non - interacting ( @xmath15 ) model yields @xmath16 $ ] ( where we are now considering zero temperature real frequency green s functions ) .",
    "the two - site model allows a minimal frequency dependence in @xmath6 . by exactly diagonalizing the many particle hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ impham ] , the local on - impurity - site interacting green s function @xmath17 can be constructed from the lehmann representation , and the self - energy @xmath18 is extracted ( _ c.f . _",
    "eq .  [ dmftsigma ] ) using : @xmath19    the full functional self - consistency of eq .",
    "[ dmftsc ] can not be achieved within such a restricted representation so it is necessary to decide how best to implement a self - consistency requirement .",
    "potthoff chose two physically motivated features , taking advantage of the analytic simplicity of the two - site impurity model .",
    "firstly , the electron fillings given by the green s functions must be equal for the impurity model and the lattice model .",
    "secondly , features of the central quasiparticle peak are matched : the self - energy is reduced to the low energy form @xmath20 , and terms of the resulting `` coherent '' impurity and lattice green s functions at high energy are matched ( see ref .   for more detail ) . in effect , the shape of the central quasiparticle peak is analyzed by the size of its high energy tails , isolated from other parts of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting self - consistency conditions for the four bath parameters ( @xmath21 ) are : @xmath22 where the quasiparticle residue @xmath23 and we have assumed that @xmath24 .    solving these equations produces results for the mott transition which compare well with the full dmft , and properties of the fermi liquid which are consistent with exact results ( see ref .  ) .",
    "it is hard to imagine a simpler model which can do this ; it succeeds because of the physical motivation of its self - consistency conditions , namely the filling and properties of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "it is a useful approach for calculations on extended models such as multiple bands  @xcite and , as we shall demonstrate , clusters .",
    "we now consider an extension of this method to cluster dmft :  @xcite instead of starting with a single site , self - consistency conditions are derived for a cluster of sites , which allows a momentum dependence in the self - energy .",
    "the geometry of the lattice becomes important and hence different types of magnetic order can be investigated , and spectral information varies non - trivially in @xmath25-space , unlike conventional dmft .",
    "a number of studies have been reported .",
    "@xcite we describe here a cluster dmft for the case where the cluster consists of just a pair of sites .",
    "we then detail how to implement potthoff s two - site method to solve cluster dmft .",
    "this can be contrasted with the exact diagonalization formulation of conventional dmft ,  @xcite where a single impurity site with multiple bath sites is used ; instead , we use multiple impurity sites in a cluster and include correlations in the simplest way via potthoff s scheme for single bath sites .",
    "below , we derive the self - consistency conditions for the pair - cluster ( each of the two cluster sites is connected to a single bath site ) .",
    "implementing a cluster dmft is fundamentally ambiguous , as recently noted by biroli _",
    "et al . _ ;  @xcite the approach we adopt is `` cdmft '' within their classification , which is arguably the simplest scheme appropriate for broken symmetry states .",
    "one of the strengths of conventional dmft is that it is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "in contrast , our cluster approach is not a systematic @xmath26 correction , though it is of course exact in the limit of infinite cluster size when the self - consistent bath is merely a sophisticated boundary condition .",
    "@xcite    in cluster dmft we imagine integrating out all sites except those in the cluster .",
    "an electron can in general now leave from and arrive back at any of the sites within the cluster : the function @xmath6 must become a matrix , coupling together the dynamics of the cluster sites .",
    "the resulting action ( _ c.f . _ eq .  [ dmftseff ] ) is : @xmath27 where the summations are over the cluster sites . solving this local problem",
    "now yields a matrix @xmath28 and a matrix self - energy .",
    "different approaches to cluster dmft involve different ways of combining the matrix self - energy with the non - interacting lattice green s function , and different self - consistency conditions .",
    "we shall now describe our particular approach , for the specific case of a 2d square lattice with a cluster consisting of a pair of sites .",
    "the sites represent the two sublattices of the bipartite square lattice , and we label them @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "eq .  [ dmftlatgf ] ) :",
    "full self - consistency would require that the matrix version of eq .",
    "[ dmftsc ] be satisfied , but here because of the restricted representation of @xmath36 using just two additional non - interacting sites , we must adopt a more modest self - consistency requirement .",
    "we generalize the approach of ref .   and require firstly that the filling of each sublattice is the same for the impurity and lattice models : @xmath37 which will effectively constrain @xmath38 .",
    "the second condition characterizes the coherent quasiparticle peak .",
    "expanding the green s function matrices at high @xmath39 , with the coherent form of the self - energy in place , gives a matrix equation self - consistency equation involving a quasiparticle residue matrix @xmath40 : @xmath41    after the @xmath25-sum has been carried out we obtain the self - consistency condition : @xmath42 this constrains @xmath43 in terms of the quasiparticle residues @xmath44 calculated from the local self - energy .",
    "we now describe the implementation of our cluster dmft approach .",
    "the eight self - consistent equations ( eqs  [ clustersc1 ] and  [ clustersc2 ] ) are solved for the eight bath parameters @xmath45 , and additionally we wish to consider a given total filling @xmath46 , and this provides a ninth condition which constrains the chemical potential @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "the practical problem is thus nine - dimensional root finding , for which we use a broyden method combined with line searches .",

    "after a pseudogap has formed , the luttinger volume can not be defined as usual ; the active fermi surface consists of hole pockets , and rest of the filled region of @xmath25-space is bounded by portions of the original fermi surface where @xmath74 falls smoothly , without a step .",
    "the features described above are reminiscent of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors in their normal state , which are believed to have a fermi surface consisting of arc - like segments separated by pseudogap regions ( see for example refs  ) . a picture where the dispersion relation hybridizes with a `` ghost '' dispersion is consistent with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments ( see for example fig .  58 of ref .  ) , and also emerges from other theoretical models.@xcite    there are important differences , however , between our results and what is seen in the cuprates , most significantly in the position of the arcs and the pseudogap regions . in the cuprates",
    "the fermi surface arcs are seen at @xmath110 but appear near @xmath111 in our calculations , and the pseudogap occurs near @xmath70 in the cuprates but near @xmath110 in our calculations .",
    "however , our results are not incompatible , as restriction to a cluster with only a pair of sites severely constrains the momentum dependence of the electron self - energy .",
    "fermi surface shapes can only be formed from the original dispersion @xmath112 in combination with the asymmetric dispersion @xmath113 ( as eq .",
    "[ qpgf ] shows ) .",
    "this does not admit the @xmath114-wave symmetry observed in the cuprates but only @xmath115- and @xmath116-wave configurations , which means for example that arcing can only happen near the van hove points such as @xmath70 .",
    "adding more sites to the cluster would progressively optimize our approximation to the real shape , and we intend to extend our work to a four site ( @xmath32 ) cluster which would permit @xmath114-wave symmetry , though at the price of greater numerical complexity .",
    "we have presented the zero temperature properties of a cluster - type extension of dynamical mean - field theory , where the self - consistency equations have been solved in a very restricted basis .",
    "our approach allows us to calculate the full phase diagram of a fully interacting system , and it can be surveyed and understood through access to complete spectral information .",
    "the basis we chose is `` two - site dmft '' , whose results compare favorably with other theories and experiment ; our cluster extension additionally allows a limited momentum dependence of the self - energy .",
    "our results provide clues to several puzzling features of the metal ",
    "insulator transition and how antiferromagnetism , proximity to van hove points , and formation of the mott gap compete with one another ; all play a rle in various regimes .",
    "the van hove point causes fermi surface distortions even at low @xmath1 ; nesting causes slater antiferromagnetism near half - filling ; and the mott gap becomes significant at high @xmath1 as one might have anticipated .",
    "in addition , we see how @xmath2-@xmath95 model physics manifests itself at large @xmath1 via the small magnetic gap .",
    "we also see how , as the metal  insulator transition is approached",
    ", the fermi surface evolves from a renormalized fermi liquid obeying luttinger s theorem , to a pseudogap state where a gap opens on some parts of the fermi surface breaking it up into hole pockets ( with a strongly momentum - dependent spectral density ) .",
    "our work is easily extensible to more sophisticated cluster dmft schemes or multiple bands , and we intend to study a @xmath32 cluster which allows tetragonal symmetry and would compare more directly with the cuprates ."
