    "over the past two decades , the utility of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as standardizable candles to trace the expansion history of the universe has been underscored by the increasing resources dedicated to optical / near - ir discovery and follow - up campaigns ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the same time , the nature of their progenitor system(s ) has remained elusive , despite aggressive studies to unveil them ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second nearest ia sn discovered in the digital era , sn  2011fe @xcite located at @xmath6 @xcite , represents a natural test bed for a detailed sn ia progenitor study @xcite . ] .",
    "the best studied type ia sn at early times before sn  2011fe , sn  2009ig , demonstrated how single events can provide significant insight into the properties of this class of explosions @xcite .",
    "the fundamental component of sn ia progenitor models is an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system .",
    "currently , the most popular models include ( i ) a single - degenerate ( hereafter , sd ) scenario in which a massive wd accretes material from a h - rich or he - rich companion , potentially a giant , subgiant or main - sequence star , ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mass is transferred either via roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) or through stellar winds .",
    "alternatively , ( ii ) models invoke a double sub-@xmath7 wd binary system that eventually merges ( double degenerate model , dd ; @xcite , @xcite ) .    in sd models ,",
    "the circumbinary environment may be enriched by the stellar wind of the donor star or through non - conservative mass transfer in which a small amount of material is lost to the surroundings .",
    "winds from the donor star shape the local density profile as @xmath8 over a @xmath9 parsec region encompassing the binary system .",
    "theoretical considerations indicate that the wind - driven mass loss rate must be low , since an accretion rate of just @xmath10 is ideal for the wd to grow slowly up to @xmath7 and still avoid mass - losing nova eruptions ( steady burning regime , @xcite ) .",
    "strong evidence for the _ lack _ of a wind - stratified medium and/or the detection of a constant local density ( with a typical interstellar medium density of @xmath11 ) may instead point to a dd model .",
    "arising from the interaction of the sn shock blast wave with the circumbinary material , radio and x - ray observations can potentially discriminate between the two scenarios by shedding light on the properties of the environment , shaped by the evolution of the progenitor system ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "motivated thus , several dozen sne ia at distances @xmath12 mpc have been observed with the very large array ( vla ; @xcite ; @xcite ; soderberg in prep . ) , the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite , and the swift x - ray telescope ( @xcite ; russel & immler , in press ) revealing no detections to date .",
    "these limits were used to constrain the density of the circumbinary material , and in turn the mass loss rate of the progenitor system .",
    "however these data poorly constrain the wd companion , due in part to the limited sensitivity of the observations ( and the distance of the sne ) .",
    "the improved sensitivity of the expanded very large array ( evla ) coupled with a more detailed approach regarding the relevant radio and x - ray emission ( and absorption ) processes in type ia supernovae , has enabled the deepest constraints to date on a circumbinary progenitor as discussed in our companion paper on the recent type ia sn2011fe/ ptf11kly ( @xcite . see also @xcite ) .    here",
    "we report a detailed panchromatic study of sn2011fe bridging optical / uv and gamma - ray observations . drawing from observations with the _ swift _ and chandra satellites as well as the interplanetary network ( ipn ; @xcite ) , we constrain the properties of the bulk ejecta and circumbinary environment through a self - consistent characterization of the dynamical evolution of the shockwave .",
    "first we present optical / uv light - curves for the sn , indicating that the object appears consistent with a `` normal '' sn ia .",
    "next we discuss deep limits on the x - ray emission in the month following explosion .",
    "we furthermore report gamma - ray limits ( 25 - 150 kev ) for the shock breakout pulse . in the appendix we present an analytic generalization for the the inverse compton ( ic ) x - ray luminosity expected from hydrogen poor sne that builds upon previous work by @xcite and @xcite but is broadly applicable for a wide range of shock properties , metallicity , photon temperatures , and circumstellar density profiles ( stellar wind or ism ; see appendix [ sec : iclum ] ) .",

    "given the exceptional proximity of sn  2011fe we nevertheless searched for evidence of high - energy emission from the shock break - out using data collected by the nine spacecrafts of the interplanetary network ( ipn mars odyssey , konus - wind , rhessi , integral ( spi - acs ) , _",

    "were detected and localized by multiple instruments of the ipn .",
    "out of these 3 confirmed bursts , one has localization consistent with sn  2011fe .",
    "interestingly , this burst was detected by konus , suzaku and integral ( spi - acs ) on august 23rd 13:28:25 ut : for comparison , the inferred explosion time of sn  2011fe is @xmath152 minutes , @xcite .",
    "the ipn error box area for this burst is @xmath153 sr .",
    "the poor localization of this event does not allow us to firmly associate this burst with sn  2011fe : from poissonian statistics we calculate a @xmath154 chance probability for this burst to be spatially consistent with sn  2011fe .",
    "a more detailed analysis reveals that sn  2011fe lies inside the konus - integral triangulation annulus but outside the konus - suzaku triangulation annulus .",
    "furthermore , at the inferred time of explosion , sn  2011fe was slightly above the fermi - gbm horizon , but no burst was detected ( in spite of the stable gbm background around this time ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no statistically significant evidence for a sn - associated burst down to the fermi - gbm threshold ( fluence @xmath155 in the 8 - 1000 kev band ) for a sn - associated burst with fluence above the _ swift _ threshold and below the fermi - gbm one to occur without being detected . ] .",
    "the early photometry of sn  2011fe constrains the progenitor radius to be @xmath156 @xcite . using the fiducial values @xmath45 , @xmath53",
    ", the shock break out associated with sn  2011fe is therefore expected to have released @xmath157 over a time - scale @xmath158 with luminosity @xmath159 at typical @xmath160 ( see @xcite , their eq .",
    "29 ) . at the distance of sn  2011fe",
    ", the expected fluence is as low as @xmath161 which is below the threshold of all gamma - ray observatories currently on orbit ( the weakest burst observed by bat had a 15 - 150 kev fluence of @xmath162 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the konus - suzaku - integral burst formally consistent with the position of sn  2011fe was detected with fluence @xmath163 and duration of a few seconds ( peak flux of @xmath164 ) .",
    "if it were to be connected with the sn , the associated @xmath165sec peak luminosity would be @xmath166 and total energy @xmath167 ( quantities computed in the 20 - 1400 kev energy band ) which are orders of magnitudes above expectations .    for @xmath168 ,",
    "the temperature and luminosity drop quickly ( see @xcite for details ) : in particular , for @xmath169 the emitting shell enters the newtonian phase . for sn  2011fe",
    "we estimate @xmath170 ( @xcite , their eq .",
    "30 ) ; for @xmath156 the luminosity at @xmath171 is @xmath172 with typical emission in the soft x - rays : @xmath173 . at later times @xmath174 @xcite while @xmath175 rapidly drops below the _ swift_-xrt energy band ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) .",
    "_ swift_-xrt observations were unfortunately not acquired early enough to constrain the shock break out emission from sn  2011fe .",
    "uv observations were not acquired early enough either : after @xmath176 hr the uv emission connected with the shock break out is expected to be strongly suppressed due to the deviation from pure radiation domination ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is however interesting to note the presence of a `` shoulder '' in the uv light - curve @xcite particularly prominent in the uvm2 filter for @xmath177 days ( see @xcite , their fig .",
    "2 ) whose origin is still unclear ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed modeling is required to disentangle the contribution of different physical processes to the early uv emission ( and understand which is the role of the `` red leak '' -see e.g. @xcite- of the uvm2 filter in shaping the observed light - curve ) .",
    "the collision of the sn ejecta with the companion star is also expected to produce x - ray emission with typical release of energy @xmath178 in the hours following the explosion ( a mechanism which has been referred to as the analog of shock break out emission in core collapse sne , @xcite ) . according to @xcite , in the most favorable scenario of a red - giant companion of @xmath179 at separation distance @xmath180 , the interaction time - scale is @xmath181 after the sn explosion and the burst of x - ray radiation lasts @xmath182 ( with a typical luminosity @xmath183 ) :",
    "too short to be caught by our _ swift_-xrt re - pointing 1.25 days after the explosion .",
    "we furthermore estimate the high energy tail of the longer lasting thermal optical / uv emission associated to the collision with the companion star to be too faint to be detected either : at @xmath184 , the emission has @xmath185 and peaks at frequency @xmath186 ( eq . 25 from @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal particle acceleration might be a source of x - rays at these times , a scenario for which we still lack clear predictions : future studies will help understand the role of non - thermal emission in the case of the collision of a sn with its companion star .",
    "ic emission provides solid limits to the environment density which are _ not _ dependent on assumptions about the poorly constrained magnetic field energy density ( i. e. the @xmath50 parameter ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is different from the synchrotron emission , which was used in our companion paper @xcite to constrain the environment of the same event from the deepest radio observations ever obtained for a sn ia .",
    "the two perspectives are complementary : the use of the same assumptions and of a consistent formalism furthermore allows us to constrain the post - shock energy density in magnetic fields vs. ambient density parameter space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilonb ] ) .",
    "this plot shows how deep and contemporaneous radio and x - rays observations of sne might be used to infer the shock parameters .",
    "the ic luminosity is however strongly dependent on the sn bolometric luminosity : @xmath62 .",
    "here we presented the deepest limit on the ambient density around a type ia sn obtained from x - ray observations .",
    "our results directly benefit from : ( i ) unprecedented deep _ chandra _ observations of one of the nearest type ia sne , coupled to ( ii ) a consistent treatment of the dynamics of the sn shock interaction with the environment ( appendix [ sec : iclum ] and @xcite ) , together with ( iii ) the direct computation of the sn bolometric luminosity from _ swift_/uvot data .",
    "in particular we showed that :    * assuming a wind profile the x - ray non - detections imply a mass loss @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath189 deeper than the limit reported by @xcite .",
    "this rules out symbiotic binary progenitors for sn  2011fe and argues against roche - lobe overflowing subgiants and main sequence secondary stars _",
    "if _ a fraction @xmath114 of the transferred mass is lost at the lagrangian points and the wd is steadily burning .",
    "* were sn  2011fe to be embedded in an ism environment , our calculations constrain the density to @xmath190 .",
    "whatever the density profile , the x - ray non - detections are suggestive of a _ clean _ environment around sn  2011fe , for distances in the range @xmath191 .",
    "this is either consistent with the bulk of material ( transferred from the donor star to the accreting wd or resulting from the merging of the two wds ) to be confined within the binary system or with a significant delay @xmath127 yr between mass loss and sn explosion ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the context of dd mergers , the presence of material on distances @xmath124 ( as recently suggested by e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) has been excluded by @xcite based on the lack of bright , early uv / optical emission .",
    "we furthermore looked for bursts of gamma - rays associated with the shock break out from sn  2011fe .",
    "we find no statistically significant evidence for a sn - associated burst for fluences @xmath192 .",
    "however , with progenitor radius @xmath193 the expected sn  2011fe shock break out fluence is @xmath194 , below the sensitivity of gamma - ray detectors currently on orbit .    the proximity of sn  2011fe coupled to the sensitivity of _ chandra _ observations , make the limits presented in this paper difficult to be surpassed in the near future for type ia sne .",
    "however , the generalized ic formalism of appendix [ sec : iclum ] is applicable to the entire class of hydrogen poor sne , and will provide the tightest constraints to the explosion environment _ if _ x - ray observations are acquired around maximum light ( see fig .",
