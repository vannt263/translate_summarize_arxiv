    "some years ago berry@xcite suggested that quantum eigenstates of classically chaotic systems should locally look like random superpositions of plane waves of the same ( local ) wavevector magnitude @xmath0 , producing gaussian random fluctuations in position space .",
    "this is the natural quantum manifestation of complete classical uniformity on the energy hypersurface for chaotic systems .",
    "it is also a consequence of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , assuming that this theory applies to classically chaotic systems@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gutzwiller periodic orbit theory of the energy spectra of classically chaotic systems has enjoyed much success , and it would be strange if periodic orbits had no visible manifestation in the eigenstates . indeed , exact solutions of the schrdinger equation for classically chaotic systems sometimes exhibit obvious and apparently nonrandom patterns of concentration on periodic orbits .",
    "other non - coordinate space representations such as projections onto coherent states ( husimi phase space ) naturally show the same effect .",
    "this is a fully quantum phenomenon , although the explanation of scarring in terms of classical periodic orbits and their stability exponents@xcite is based on semiclassical arguments .",
    "it is known that the structure of individual quantum eigenstates can often be well reproduced in the semiclassical approximation , ignoring ",
    "hard quantum \" effects such as tunneling and diffraction@xcite .",
    "scars are surprising because classically ( in the absence of phase coherence ) there is no such accumulation of density near a periodic orbit in the long time limit for a bounded chaotic system .",
    "scars are interesting because they stand out against the monotonous backdrop of wavefunction randomness over most of phase space .",
    "it has been shown that explicitly constructed `` random '' wavefunctions ( random superpositions of plane waves with constant wavevector magnitude ) show a ridge pattern that can be thought of as a precursor of true scarring@xcite .",
    "scars have now been seen in many studies , including experimental work in microwave cavities@xcite , tunnel junctions@xcite , and the hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field@xcite .    to the casual observer",
    "the scarring phenomenon finds its proof in visual evidence ( _ e.g. _ heavily scarred wavefunctions when plotted in coordinate space ) .",
    "however there are quantitative reasons for scarring ; the first theory for them@xcite was based on wavepacket motion ( in the semiclassical limit ) along a periodic orbit , and used the _",
    "linearized _ short time dynamics near the orbit .",
    "this was a husimi phase space theory ; subsequent work by bogomolny@xcite and berry@xcite were coordinate space and wigner phase space theories , respectively .",
    "these also were based purely on the linearized dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit .",
    "@xcite showed that scar strength for the heavily scarred states , as measured by the ratio of actual density to statistically expected density , was expected to be a function of the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 only , tending to @xmath2 for small @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "( note the independence of @xmath4 . )",
    "that paper also remarked that scars are sometimes much stronger than this . at the other extreme ,",
    "steiner s work with systems of constant negative curvature was claimed to show no scarring when it was supposed to exist@xcite .",
    "these factors plus confusion over the definition and measures of scar strength have understandably caused much discussion of whether there is indeed a theory of scar strength .",
    "the work by fishman , agam , and co - workers@xcite has provided additional perspectives , and a proposed measure for scars , about which we comment later .",
    "the main points of this paper are ( 1 ) to point out that very often the original linear theory , together with a proper account of gaussian fluctuations and symmetry is sufficient to understand scar strength ; ( 2 ) to show that scarring stronger than this may sometimes be understood in terms of identifiable _ nonlinear _ homoclinic recurrences associated with a given periodic orbit , the effect of which recurrences will turn out to be @xmath4-dependent ; ( 3 ) to firm up the existing definitions and measures of scarring ; and ( 4 ) to extend the notion of scarring to classical structures associated with periodic orbits , as suggested already by the work of voros@xcite .",
    "we do not attempt here to treat the case of many periodic orbits of similar stability , period , and action contributing within one @xmath4 cell in phase space .",
    "this can also dramatically enhance scarring , but it is a non - asymptotic effect which disappears in the @xmath5 limit .    in the following section ,",
    "we hope to clarify the concept of scarring .",
    "then we provide a review of the original linear theory , for completeness and to establish the important concept of the spectral envelope , which we use heavily . after presenting the properties of scars as a localization phenomenon ,",
    "we turn to considerations of discrete symmetries , and of nonlinear fluctuations about the envelope , which together explain many cases of enhanced wavefunction scarring . connections with semiclassical theory are made here , and emphasis is placed on the constraints which the short - time dynamics places on the stationary properties of the system .",
    "various measures of scarring are described , including ones which explicitly incorporate the linearized dynamics around a classical orbit .",
    "this is followed by numerical studies which show the expected amount of scarring according to the linear theory supplemented by gaussian random fluctuations , in the first statistical study of a large number of scarred states .",
    "numerical evidence is also presented for the effects on scarring of individual homoclinic orbits , in a situation where the long - time recurrences are not random .",
    "we end with a discussion of the state of the theory of wavefunction scarring .",
    "we begin with a list of things which are _ not _ properties of scars , followed by a list of properties which are in fact associated with scars .",
    "several of these statements will gradually become clearer in the theory sections to follow .    0.1 in what scars are _ not _",
    ":    *   scarring is not associated with stable classical orbits .",
    "these do of course attract wavefunction density strongly in some eigenstates , but the reasons are well understood in terms of the semiclassical theory of integrable systems@xcite .",
    "the scarring phenomenon is also qualitatively distinct from the  bouncing ball \" states associated with marginally stable orbits@xcite . *",
    "weak scars are not always visible to the `` naked eye '' ; there is scarring nonetheless according to the definition given below .",
    "the amount of scarring associated with specific eigenstates varies significantly from state to state , though in accordance with a theoretically predicted distribution .",
    "also orbits with larger instability exponents exhibit less scarring on average , and a statistical analysis may be necessary in such cases to determine that scarring is indeed present .",
    "*   scarring is not a threat to ergodicity of wavefunctions in the sense of schnirelman , zelditch , and colin de verdiere@xcite , because the phase space area affected by scarring vanishes in the semiclassical limit , forming a narrower and narrower region around the periodic orbit .",
    "* scars are not merely associated with a one dimensional line along a periodic orbit ; rather , they are associated also with the stable and unstable manifolds of that orbit .",
    "for this reason , a phase space study of scarring may often be more illuminating than a coordinate space projection .",
    "*   scars do not disappear as @xmath5 , except in the sense that the total amount of scarring is expected to become distributed over an ever increasing number of eigenstates in that limit , while the region of phase space in which the eigenstates are scarred is simultaneously decreasing .",
    "what scars are :    we begin with a definition , close to what was already given in the 1989 les houches proceedings@xcite :    * _ definition : _ a quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system has a _ scar _ of a periodic orbit if its density on the classical invariant manifolds near the periodic orbit is enhanced over the statistically expected density .",
    "* alternatively , an unstable periodic orbit is scarred when some eigenstates of the system have greater amplitude , and others less amplitude , along the orbit than would be predicted based on gaussian random fluctuations .",
    "also , a wavepacket launched on or near such an orbit will have a tendency to return to the orbit , having larger overlaps with itself at long times than a wavepacket launched elsewhere in phase space .",
    "* scars can appear as strong enhancements in the eigenfunction coordinate space density surrounding periodic orbits , especially near self - conjugate points along the classical orbit , as shown by bogomolny@xcite .",
    "* scar strength @xmath6 , as measured by the projection of scarred eigenstates onto a coherent state centered on the scarring periodic orbit and aligned along the stable and unstable manifolds , is generically a function only of @xmath1 , the lyapunov exponent for one period of the periodic orbit , and is @xmath4-independent . for small @xmath1 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant obtained by considering the linear theory at short times combined with random long - time fluctuations .",
    "* enhancements of the scarring phenomenon can occur in the presence of strong , isolated long - time recurrences associated with homoclinic orbits .",
    "symmetry factors also must be included if one is to obtain a quantitatively correct picture of scarring .",
    "for completeness and context we need to review the linear theory of scarring , first discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "consider an unstable fixed point of a classical map located at the origin , with the stable and unstable manifolds oriented along the @xmath9 ( vertical ) and @xmath10 ( horizontal ) axes , respectively .",
    "( we will adopt this choice of coordinate system throughout .",
    "in general , a canonical transformation needs to be performed , _",
    "e.g. _ in the case of an inverted harmonic oscillator , to rotate and skew the stable and unstable manifolds into this alignment ) . linearizing the map around the fixed point",
    ", we obtain to first order @xmath11 where @xmath1 is the lyapunov exponent for one iteration of the orbit .",
    "( the situation is very similar in the case where the stable and unstable manifolds are not thus aligned , and analogous formulae can be derived for that scenario .",
    "also , for simplicity we do not discuss the case of a wavepacket centered near , but not on , a periodic orbit ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . )",
    "we now take a gaussian wavepacket @xmath12 which corresponds to a classical distribution centered on the origin with width @xmath13 in the @xmath10 direction and width @xmath14 in the @xmath9 direction ( @xmath15 , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath16 ) .",
    "now for a small enough @xmath4 , the initial wavepacket and its short - time iterates are contained within the linear regime , and we have the time - evolved wavepacket @xmath17 given by the expression above in eq .  [ wavepkt ] with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 is a quantum operator corresponding locally to the classical dynamics given by eq .",
    "[ clasdyn ] ) .",
    "classically this corresponds to a horizontal stretching and vertical shrinking of the gaussian distribution in phase space .",
    "the overlap @xmath20 is easily found by gaussian integration ( notice that the autocorrelation function @xmath21 is independent of @xmath13 , the width of the initial wavepacket ) . here @xmath22 is the quantum phase associated with the fixed point ( semiclassically it is given by @xmath23 , @xmath6 being the action for one traversal of the periodic orbit , plus maslov phases arising from caustics ) .",
    "this time domain behavior can be fourier transformed to obtain an envelope in the ( quasi-)energy spectrum , centered at @xmath24 and with a width which depends only on @xmath1 , scaling linearly with @xmath1 for small @xmath1 .",
    "we remark here that the situation for a fixed point of period @xmath25 is similar . in this case",
    "the linear autocorrelation function is nonzero only at integer multiples of @xmath26 , and the corresponding spectrum has @xmath26 identical bumps , each of a width and height related to the instability of the entire orbit ( see also the discussion in section  [ pgt1 ] ) .",
    "additional time scales are present in a continuous - time system , which are not directly relevant to the phenomenon of scarring , but which produce a background spectrum relative to which scarring can manifest itself . these issues are addressed in section  [ contitime ] of this paper .    in the case of exact linearity , or where the evolving wavefunctions are allowed to escape to infinity at long times ( as in an inverted harmonic oscillator ) , the preceding is all that there is to be said about the spectrum of the wavepacket .",
    "the width of the spectral bump then corresponds to a decay rate .",
    "but in a closed , unitary system , the escaping probability must eventually start returning to the origin . in a classically mixing system",
    ", this will begin happening not later than by the mixing time , this being the time required for a classical distribution corresponding to a minimum uncertainty wavepacket to spread through all of phase space on a mesh of size @xmath4 .",
    "the mixing time scales as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the ",
    "typical \" exponent for the entire system , and @xmath29 is the total number of states in the available phase space .",
    "the key point is that the fourier transform of @xmath21 for small @xmath1 localizes the spectrum ( local density of states ) to a region of width @xmath30 , smaller than the whole quasi - energy interval . in effect",
    "the initial state is in a resonance mode which decays more slowly than a random state",
    ". a random state should decay in a time of the order of a single time step for a discrete map .",
    "( the reason for the single step decay is simple : a random state having a random ( _ i.e. _ rmt ) local density of states spectrum has a quasi - energy uncertainty of the whole interval ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "now @xmath32 implies @xmath33 , _",
    "i.e. _ one time step ) .",
    "the corresponding resolved spectrum for a wavepacket launched on a periodic orbit thus _ can not _ be picked from an _ a priori _ rmt local density of states , as figure  [ envel ] shows .",
    "now , to complete the point , we recall that the spectral line intensities are the squared projections of eigenstates onto the local `` test '' gaussian . _",
    "the intensities are the `` support '' of the envelope , and are thus required to be ( upon local average ) larger in the peak region of the envelope than rmt predicts by a factor of order @xmath34 .",
    "this enhancement of the overlaps ( that is , the enhancement by a factor of order @xmath34 over the statistical expectation of @xmath35 , where @xmath29 is the dimension of the hilbert space ) means that at a minimum there must be states with a projection onto the test state of order @xmath34 larger than what is statistically expected .",
    "however , if this projection were to be shared in an egalitarian fashion among all the available states , then most or all of the states in the peak region would be enhanced by this factor . on the other hand , if only a small fraction @xmath36 of the available states are enhanced , then these states must have larger projections @xmath37 onto the test state in order to support the local density of states envelope .",
    "these two extremes are illustrated in figure  [ envel2 ] .",
    "the short time dynamics , which depends only on the linear or `` tangent '' map around the periodic orbit on which the test gaussian is centered , can not tell us without further assumptions which extreme ( or intermediate ) regime is realized ; it only tells us that some states must be enhanced .",
    "the egalitarian case corresponds to the least striking type of scarring , since each state is enhanced at most by a factor of order @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath1 is not too small , this enhancement is not even competitive with the fluctuations expected from rmt , and we might conclude by cursory inspection that individual states are not scarred at all . indeed , this would be a justifiable definition , although the _ systematic _ , statistically significant enhancement of many nearby states in the egalitarian case would still reveal the underlying mechanism of scar localization . in effect",
    "this definition was adopted by steiner and co - workers@xcite in their studies of the eigenstates of the hyperbolic billiards , which appear to live close to the egalitarian limit . in the opposite `` totalitarian '' extreme ,",
    "enhancements are very large , and scars are obvious in pictures of eigenstates , even for orbits which are very unstable .",
    "it is important to note however that for small @xmath1 even the linear ( short time ) theory in the `` worst case '' egalitarian scenario predicts strong scarring , well above the typical rmt fluctuations , of strength @xmath38 .",
    "these considerations extend easily to include the possible dependence of scar strength on @xmath4 or on the density of states . if the density of states is such that only one or a few states can exist within a quasi - energy width @xmath1 , then effectively only the `` totalitarian '' option exists",
    "this is a strong localization regime , where one or a few states carry the total scar intensity . at the ideal unitary limit of an overlap of @xmath39",
    ", one state is entirely localized to the periodic orbit region .",
    "( this was the basis for our conclusion that the bouncing ball modes in the stadium billiard persist up to infinite energy@xcite ) .",
    "starting from this extreme , as @xmath29 increases , the scar strength of individual eigenstates _",
    "could _ decrease as fast as @xmath35 , in the egalitarian limit , although the intensity _ enhancement factor _ would still remain finite , as the average intensity is also decreasing as @xmath35 .",
    "( in a billiard system there is a @xmath40 increase in the number of affected states with increasing @xmath41 : the density of states is independent of @xmath41 but the energy width @xmath42 of the scar `` resonance '' scales as @xmath43 , where again @xmath1 is the lyapunov exponent for a complete period of the orbit . the time required to traverse this orbit goes as @xmath44 , thus @xmath45 ) .",
    "we remark that scarring can become no weaker than the egalitarian limit defined above for any given periodic orbit , even as @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that the egalitarian limit is the usual circumstance as @xmath46 .",
    "then scars become less dramatic but do not disappear as @xmath46 as measured by the test states whose area in a surface of section is @xmath47 .",
    "however this area ( projected onto coordinate space , say ) amounts to a diminishing portion ( going as @xmath48 for a phase space gaussian with an aspect ratio of order unity ) of the total coordinate space volume .",
    "these subtleties have caused much confusion over whether scars `` disappear '' as @xmath46 .",
    "the projection of gaussian wavepackets , or other distributions localized around periodic orbits , onto the eigenstates as a test of their localization properties was introduced in ref .",
    "subsequently , the idea of detecting and quantifying scars by integrating over tubes in phase space surrounding the periodic orbit has been discussed@xcite .",
    "the tube should be of diameter @xmath49 normal to the direction of the orbit .",
    "the diameter originally used was @xmath4 but @xmath49 is more appropriate and is used in more recent work ( s. fishman , private communication ) .",
    "of course , the structure of the linear local dynamics around the periodic orbit must also be considered here . in particular , for certain alignments of the stable and unstable manifolds with respect to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions , a tube of width @xmath4 in position space and width @xmath39 in momentum would be equally optimal .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of li  @xcite , where certain orbits in a stadium billiard show optimal scarring in coordinate space with a tube size scaling as the wavelength ( instead of as the square root of the wavelength ) .",
    "the phase space tube approach is closely related to the gaussian wavepacket projection , as we shall now show . in two dimensions ,",
    "suppose we average the gaussian projections over the whole length of the periodic orbit ( instead of taking an overlap with a gaussian centered at just one periodic point ) .",
    "the mean wavepacket momentum points along the orbit .",
    "then we have , for an orbit pointing along the x - axis , the average projection @xmath6 given by @xmath50 where @xmath51\\nonumber \\\\   & \\sim &   \\exp[-(x'-x)^{2}/4\\sigma_{x}^{2}\\hbar -(y'-y_{0})^{2}/2\\sigma_{y}^{2}\\hbar -(y - y_{0})^{2}/2\\sigma_{y}^{2}\\hbar+   i(x - x')p_{0x}/\\hbar ] \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we wigner transform this density matrix : @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see _ this is a phase space tube surrounding the classical trajectory , of diameter @xmath53 _ , if @xmath54 , the aspect ratio in the @xmath55@xmath56 subspace , is chosen to be of order unity .",
    "hence , the relation between the fishman _ et al . _ phase space tube and the husimi projection is that the tube is the husimi projection averaged over the entire length of the orbit .",
    "the advantage of this smearing is the same as its disadvantage : it is insensitive to the local direction of the classical invariant manifolds . in this sense",
    "the tube is a somewhat duller probe for scarring , while at the same time it has the advantage of providing a more universal description of scars .      if the initial periodic orbit is sufficiently unstable , a ",
    "quiet time \" regime may exist after the linear autocorrelation function has decayed and before the nonlinear recurrences have had a chance to build up .",
    "this effect is not included in the linear theory and will be reflected in the absence of features in the spectrum corresponding to these time scales .",
    "( see also the discussion in section [ contitime ] . ) in the semiclassical limit , however , the quiet time is very short compared to the heisenberg time @xmath57 , where individual eigenvalues begin to be resolved , and where the quantum mechanics begins to be quasiperiodic .",
    "( at time @xmath58 the information contained in the quantum mechanics gets exhausted , and the autocorrelation function at longer times can be reconstructed using only the information for times up to @xmath58 . )",
    "nonlinear recurrences at times between the end of the quiet time regime and the onset of heisenberg - scale dynamics are crucial for a proper understanding of scarring , and will be the subject of section  [ nonlin ] of this paper .",
    "this section has been a review of the `` existing '' theory with remarks aimed at more recent work .",
    "there are shortcomings of this theory which we aim to remedy below :    * the linear theory does not say how the localization , predicted from the short time dynamics , actually manifests itself in the long time behavior of the autocorrelation function @xmath21 . *",
    "the linear theory can have no information about whether the totalitarian or egalitarian limit of scar intensity distribution over the available eigenstates is approached .",
    "this information comes from longer time dynamics which necessarily involves more than the linearized tangent map of the periodic orbit . *",
    "no systematic study of scar strength over a large enough ensemble to unambiguously test the predictions of the linear theory has yet been undertaken .",
    "it is well known that short time coherences in amplitudes lead to weak localization effects .",
    "an example is provided by coherent backscattering in random media , where a factor of 2 enhancement is realized from the fact that a quantum path and its time reversed image contribute equally , with the same phase .",
    "ensemble averaging can not remove this effect .",
    "scarring also involves a weak localization effect resulting from short time correlations which depend on the properties of classical _ unstable _ periodic orbits , and also symmetry , with consequences similar to those of coherent backscattering .",
    "the short time coherences have an effect on the long - time , stationary properties . in the time domain",
    ", this means that the return probability at long times for an initial state launched on an unstable periodic orbit is enhanced from what one would expect naively in the absence of this classical information . in the energy domain ,",
    "a wavepacket located near a periodic orbit will have enhanced , non - random overlaps with the available eigenstates of the system .",
    "these enhanced overlaps imply that scarring exists , although there is a subtle issue of how the `` scar strength '' is to be shared amongst the eligible eigenstates .",
    "this issue of scar sharing is key to understanding the strength of scars in individual eigenstates .",
    "we will describe briefly the concept of weak localization from the time and energy points of view and the connection between them ( a fuller discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and then go on to discuss how such an effect can arise from short - time classical behavior .    consider a compact classical phase space of area @xmath59 , with chaotic dynamics given by a discrete - time evolution ( area - preserving map of @xmath59 onto itself ) , and no conserved quantities .",
    "a two - dimensional billiard can be reduced to such a discrete time one - dimensional map by the surface of section technique .",
    "( although we restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension for specificity , the concepts are completely generalizable . )",
    "our results can be extended to a situation in which conserved quantities ( such as energy ) are present , by considering flow between phase space - localized states ( usually coherent states ) , and taking account of the energy spread contained in such states .",
    "this problem is treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is also mentioned briefly in section[contitime ] of this paper .",
    "we will assume in the present discussion that all of phase space is classically accessible from any smooth starting distribution .",
    "if the area is an integer multiple of planck s constant @xmath47 , @xmath60 , the system can be quantized ( with a choice of quantization conditions ) , to obtain an @xmath29-dimensional hilbert space . because the underlying classical dynamics is completely ergodic , one might expect the eigenstates to appear random in any natural basis , such as that of position , momentum , or gaussian states .",
    "thus , let @xmath61 be such a physically - motivated basis and @xmath62 be the basis of eigenstates .",
    "then we expect the overlaps @xmath63 to be gaussian variables with the normalization condition @xmath64 .",
    "this does _ not _ mean that all energy eigenstates have equal overlaps with all the trial basis states , _",
    "@xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , such a gaussian distribution ( predicted by random matrix theory , which is based on the absence of a preferred basis for analyzing the dynamics ) , leads to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 if both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are real ( convenient if , for example , the dynamics is time - reversal invariant ) , and @xmath69 otherwise .",
    "this is a quantum fluctuation result and is already a deviation from the classical expectation of @xmath70 .",
    "localization , however , is taken to mean an additional deviation of the @xmath71 distribution , away from gaussian form , towards a distribution with a longer tail . in particular , the inverse participation value ( ipr ) @xmath72 ( where the average can be taken over trial states , energy eigenstates , or both , and also over an ensemble of systems ) is in the presence of such localization enhanced from its ergodic value of @xmath73 .",
    "higher moments and the behavior of the tail can also be investigated .",
    "an important point is that scars entail a correlation between overlap probabilities @xmath74 and the energies @xmath75 , for a wavepacket @xmath61 located on a periodic orbit ( such correlations are absent under the assumptions of rmt ) .",
    "in fact , in the case of random new long - time recurrences superimposed on top of semiclassically understood short - time dynamics , the distribution of @xmath71 overall and as a function of @xmath75 can be predicted analytically , in terms of that short - time dynamics , as will be shown below in section [ randfluct ] .",
    "let us now consider the connection with the time domain .",
    "we define the autocorrelation function @xmath76 , where @xmath19 is the discrete time evolution operator ( a completely analogous notation can be written down for continuous time ) .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath21 is the weighted spectrum ( local density of states ) @xmath77 .",
    "the squared autocorrelation function @xmath78 can be thought of as a wavepacket - specific form factor , similar to the usual spectral form factor @xmath79 , but weighting each term by the heights of the corresponding lines in the spectrum @xmath80 above .    for long times , in the absence of degeneracies , one easily obtains the relation @xmath81 where on the left hand side a time average must be taken over times long compared to the heisenberg time @xmath58 ( generically @xmath57 ) . within rmt , both sides of eq .",
    "[ ipr ] are predicted to approach @xmath82 , in the semiclassical limit @xmath83 .",
    "localization is associated with an enhancement in the long - time return probability @xmath84 .",
    "we will see in section  [ nonlin ] how this is possible in the case of scarring .",
    "we will also see there that short - time unstable orbits induce nontrivial correlations @xmath85 at long times @xmath86 .",
    "these will be seen to correspond to eigenvalue - eigenstate correlations ( through the formation of an envelope in the spectrum ) in the energy domain .",
    "in keeping with our treatment of the linear theory of scarring , we will now discuss long time recurrences in the autocorrelation function from a semiclassical point of view .",
    "let us consider a homoclinic orbit which begins near the fixed point @xmath87 along the unstable manifold at large negative times and again approaches the fixed point along the stable manifold at large positive times .",
    "specifically , let the orbit @xmath88 be given by @xmath89 , such that @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "then we claim that a thin vertical strip cut out of the initial gaussian near @xmath94 at time @xmath86 will intersect the same gaussian as a long horizontal strip at @xmath95 at a much later time @xmath96 .",
    "note that because the wavepacket is contained well inside the linearizable region around the fixed point , the dynamics from time @xmath86 to time @xmath96 can be divided into three parts .",
    "first , the tall , narrow distribution shrinks vertically and stretches horizontally as its center moves out horizontally at an exponential rate along the unstable manifold ( for , let us say , @xmath97 steps ) .",
    "this is followed by complicated nonlinear dynamics which eventually brings the center of the distribution back into the linearizable region , this time along the stable manifold of the fixed point .",
    "now the part of the distribution which is in the linear region again begins to stretch horizontally and shrink vertically , becoming a narrow horizontal strip moving in towards the original wavepacket .",
    "we will denote by @xmath98 the time spent in this last stage of the evolution .",
    "the first and third parts of the dynamics allow the breadth of the initial distribution centered on @xmath99 and the height of the final distribution centered on @xmath100 both to be small compared to the size of the gaussian wavepacket .",
    "all of this is illustrated in figure  [ mani ] .",
    "the overlaps of the gaussian with the vertical and horizontal strips , as well as the effects of the linear dynamics in stages one and three are easy to write down analytically . there is also an amplitude factor @xmath101 which measures the stretching of the distribution in the nonlinear stage of the dynamics , from time @xmath102 until time @xmath103 .",
    "finally , there is a phase @xmath104 associated with this nonlinear excursion .",
    "the total contribution to the wavepacket autocorrelation function at time @xmath105 coming from this homoclinic excursion is given by a product of five factors : @xmath106 the factors @xmath107 and @xmath108 are instability factors associated with the linearized motion of the wavepacket , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the corresponding phases .",
    "the suppression factors @xmath111 and @xmath112 are associated with the fact that the initial and final points of the excursion are both off - center relative to the gaussian wavepacket .",
    "the total correlation function @xmath113 is given semiclassically by a sum of terms of the form given above over all homoclinic excursions of length @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115      one might think naively that the various contributions to the sum in eq .",
    "[ hcsum ] are all independent and uncorrelated at long times , but this is not the case .",
    "in fact , correlations are present both among the different contributions to the autocorrelation function at a fixed time , and also among homoclinic contributions of different excursion lengths @xmath116 .",
    "let us consider the homoclinic orbit of the previous subsection , with the mapping taking us from @xmath99 to @xmath100 in the time interval @xmath117 .",
    "now of course the same homoclinic orbit takes the @xmath118-step iterate of the original point , @xmath119 to the @xmath120-step iterate of the final point , @xmath121 , in a time @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath123 , we have a family of excursions , all of the same length , associated with one homoclinic orbit .",
    "an important thing to notice is that all these contributions come with the same phase , the extra phase in the final @xmath120 steps approaching the fixed point being exactly canceled by the missing @xmath118 steps at the beginning of the trip ( there is only one phase associated with the fixed point , and it is the same in stages one and three ) .",
    "( `` 1 '' and `` 5 '' in figure  [ mani ] have exactly the same phase relation as `` 2 '' and `` 6 '' . )",
    "the phase @xmath104 coming from the nonlinear dynamics in stage two is , of course , independent of @xmath124 .",
    "naturally , the exponential prefactor @xmath125 will depend on @xmath124 , so only a finite number of the infinite family of contributions for @xmath123 will be of significant size ( this number , the number of iterations for which one tends to stay near the periodic orbit , scales as @xmath38 . )",
    "however , all of these will add exactly in phase .",
    "this is an important difference between the classical and semiclassical long - time dynamics of the system .",
    "the presence of this coherence is the underlying reason for the fact that in quantum mechanics the probability for coming back to an unstable periodic orbit at long times is enhanced over the classical value of @xmath35 , which fact leads to scarring in the eigenstate domain , as seen in section  [ scarlocal ] .",
    "we also notice that if we take @xmath126 , so the new excursion length is different from the original one , the difference in phase is given by @xmath127 , and each excursion of length @xmath116 also contributes to the autocorrelation function at @xmath128 , with this extra phase and a somewhat different amplitude prefactor .",
    "thus , as will be explained in more detail in the following section , nontrivial correlations will be present in the autocorrelation function at nearby times , @xmath129 , for small @xmath130 .",
    "this is an effect that is qualitatively easy to understand even in a classical picture in terms of a `` reloading '' of the original wavepacket . because the original wavepacket is centered on a fixed point of the map , any significant recurrence at time @xmath116 is expected to be accompanied by a recurrence for all times @xmath131 , where @xmath130 is within the decay time associated with the fixed point . in effect , any new long - time recurrences get convoluted with the ( linear ) short - time dynamics of the system around the fixed point . in the energy domain , this corresponds ( by fourier transform ) to a _ multiplication _ of the original linear envelope by an oscillating function associated with the long - time recurrence .",
    "in the following section , these statements will be made more explicit and quantitative under the assumption of randomness in the homoclinic orbits which lead to long - time recurrences .",
    "in a chaotic system , the number of homoclinic orbits increases exponentially with the excursion length at long times .",
    "let us for the moment assume that the nonlinear phases associated with the terms in eq .",
    "[ hcsum ] are uncorrelated at long times .",
    "we also assume a uniform distribution of homoclinic points @xmath132 and @xmath133 along the unstable and stable manifolds .",

    "have been incorporated into the normalization factor @xmath135 .",
    "this normalization factor can easily be fixed by noticing that classically , in the absence of any coherence effects , the return probability must approach @xmath35 at long times .",
    "we now correct the assumption made in the previous paragraph and include the fact that , as discussed in the preceding section , the contributions from homoclinic excursions associated with a single homoclinic orbit all add in phase .",
    "we then have @xmath136 where the normalization factor @xmath137 is given by @xmath138 we now see that the enhancement factor @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a gaussian distribution of width @xmath13 in position and @xmath142 in momentum , and @xmath143 is the same distribution stretched by a factor of @xmath144 horizontally and compressed vertically by the same factor . in eq .

    "_ i.e. _ @xmath154 in an ensemble average .",
    "then one easily obtains the results of eqs .",
    "[ enhanced],[enhanced2 ] .",
    "the assumption being made here is that the new amplitude coming back to the fixed point at long times fills the original gaussian evenly in an unbiased way , so that the evolution of this newly returned amplitude is equivalent to the evolution of the original gaussian .",
    "we saw above that this is rigorously true semiclassically for uncorrelated homoclinic orbits .",
    "however , the picture presented here may apply also to situations where large short - time recurrences arise for reasons other than periodic orbits .",
    "these recurrences may be due to  almost periodic orbits \" , _",
    "i.e. _ classical orbits that return to within a minimum uncertainty wavepacket of the starting point in phase space .",
    "localization effects due to short - time recurrences arising from diffractive paths (  diffractive scarring \" ) may also be understandable in this general framework .",
    "it is important to point out that the reloading idea is critically dependent on the hyperbolic nature of the dynamics . with a bit of coarse graining hyperbolicity",
    "quickly erases certain information about location in phase space .",
    "more specifically , the attraction of orbits to the unstable manifolds means that location along the contracting directions is relatively unimportant .",
    "we now claim that the time domain correlations given in eq .",
    "[ timecorr ] are just the right correlations to produce spectral fluctuations which multiply the original linear envelope .",
    "( this is important because one might have thought that the oscillations in the spectrum caused by long - time recurrences simply get added to the original linear envelope , instead of multiplying it .",
    "this would produce completely different spectral behavior on small energy scales . ) indeed suppose the spectrum has the form @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the spectrum given by the linear dynamics , and @xmath157 is the fluctuating part , with the property that @xmath158 is an @xmath159independent constant ( an ensemble average is implied in the definition of @xmath160 ) .",
    "now we have @xmath161 averaging over @xmath86 , and inserting the expression for @xmath162 from above , @xmath163 finally , inserting the fluctuation intensity @xmath160 and performing the energy integral , we obtain @xmath164 which agrees with the result in eq .",
    "[ timecorr ] above , obtained by taking into account the phase coherence of all the homoclinic excursions associated with a single homoclinic orbit .",
    "up until now we have been assuming that the nonlinear recurrences associated with the homoclinic orbits are sums of random contributions , under the constraint of correlations due to the short - time linear behavior near the periodic orbit .",
    "the picture here is that random ",
    "new \" recurrences get smeared out by a function associated with the reloading effect .",
    "this leads to gaussian random fluctuations in the spectrum at all scales short compared to the inverse of the mixing time , all of these uncorrelated fluctuations multiplying the initial linear envelope .",
    "but now we have to include an additional constraint coming from heisenberg time dynamics , namely unitarity and discreteness of the spectrum . in the absence of scarring , these long - time correlations cause the mean return probability @xmath165 to converge to a value of @xmath166 at long times , @xmath167 if the eigenstates and the initial wavepacket are both purely real .",
    "we may reasonably suppose that this long - time constraint , associated with the statistics of very long excursions away from the periodic orbit , is independent of the short - time behavior near the periodic orbit .",
    "thus , if we suppose that what we in the previous section called stage two of the dynamics does not know about the trajectory s approach to the periodic orbit at times @xmath168 , then the same long - time constraints should be present in the case of scarring .",
    "so we finally obtain a discrete spectrum , with intensities given by a @xmath169 variable of 2 degrees of freedom ( 1 degree of freedom for purely real @xmath71 ) , except that in the case of scarring this rmt line spectrum multiplies the original short - time envelope . the line height associated with energy @xmath75",
    "is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a gaussian variable , real or complex , with variance one .",
    "in particular , the first two moments of this distribution are given by @xmath172 where @xmath69 or @xmath173 as explained above .",
    "we may note here that the linear spectrum @xmath162 is purely real because of the unitarity of the time evolution , @xmath174 .",
    "this holds also for the full spectrum @xmath80 , and for any smoothed spectrum obtained by fourier transforming @xmath21 for all times @xmath175 .",
    "the inverse participation ratio for the wavepacket is given by @xmath176^{-1 } \\\\",

    "higher moments of the @xmath71 distribution can be computed easily in terms of @xmath177 , always taking into account the proper quantum fluctuation factors .",
    "if the spectrum @xmath80 is ensemble - averaged while preserving the periodic orbit ( _ i.e. _ if we average over the nonlinear dynamics only ) , we recover the original linear envelope spectrum , the same spectrum which is present in the case of an open system .",
    "finally we need to mention here an issue that has been the cause of some misunderstanding in the literature , namely the issue of spatial symmetries . in symmetric systems like the stadium billiard ,",
    "many periodic orbits either remain invariant under a reflection operation , or they get shifted by some fraction of the total period , or else they get mapped to their time - reversed counterparts . in all these cases ,",
    "one expects extra correlations in the contributions coming from the homoclinic excursions which are related by such a symmetry operation .",
    "thus , consider the simplest case of a parity symmetry , where the initial wavepacket centered on the periodic orbit remains unchanged under the symmetry . of course we know from quantum mechanics that the wavepacket can overlap only with states in the even part of the hilbert space , so the ipr is increased by a factor of two from the value that would otherwise be expected .",
    "we can also see this effect semiclassically , because each homoclinic excursion away from the invariant periodic orbit has a counterpart related by parity , and the contributions from the two have the same amplitude and phase , so they add constructively .",
    "more complicated situations can be treated similarly , and we will not go into the details here . in the example",
    "described later in the paper , in section  [ genbak ] , we have intentionally desymmetrized the system of interest to eliminate the enhanced scarring effects .",
    "in the previous section , we have constructed a model in which an initial linear envelope is multiplied by random fluctuations associated with scales between the mixing time and the heisenberg time , producing a discrete spectrum with heights that have a porter - thomas distribution multiplying a smooth envelope . in this section",
    ", the picture will be extended to incorporate other time scales that may be present in the system .",
    "suppose an isolated homoclinic orbit exists which leads to an anomalously large return amplitude at some time @xmath178 which is large compared to the decay time of the linear evolution .",
    "if @xmath178 is also small compared to the time at which the returning orbits begin to proliferate exponentially , we obtain a hierarchy of scales in the spectrum .",
    "the initial linear envelope of width @xmath179 is multiplied by oscillations at a scale of @xmath180 .",
    "these oscillations , although they are associated with nonlinear dynamics and are therefore @xmath4-dependent , can nevertheless be computed semiclassically without much trouble .",
    "one can also readily include recurrences associated with iterates of the time-@xmath178 excursion .",
    "this produces a modified envelope , which remains stable until the random oscillations begin at a later time @xmath181 ( see figure  [ nonlinfig ] . )    because a reloading effect is associated with the isolated homoclinic recurrence as well as with the linear dynamics , the new , modified envelope will multiply the gaussian random fluctuations arising from long - time dynamics .",
    "the final spectrum then has structure on at least three scales .",
    "if we take this discrete spectrum and divide through by the linear envelope , we will see fluctuations on top of oscillatory behavior at scale @xmath180 .",
    "if we proceed further to divide out by these identifiable oscillations , we get something that looks like a normal porter - thomas spectrum , with no energy - intensity correlations .",
    "an example of this situation is described in section  [ genbak ] , with the numerical results appearing towards the end of section  [ genbakernum ] .    at this point",
    "it may be useful to discuss briefly the relationship between the quantum spectrum and the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the initial linear envelope can of course always be obtained semiclassically .",
    "the effect of the isolated recurrences can also be computed semiclassically as long as these occur before the breakdown of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the random fluctuations can in principle be computed semiclassically up until the breakdown time , which may be as large as a finite fraction of the heisenberg time . however , in practice this computation may be difficult for large values of @xmath29 , because of the exponential proliferation of homoclinic orbits .",
    "( this  exponential wall \" may be overcome in some systems , making use of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and of decaying time correlations in the presence of chaos@xcite . )",
    "eventually , the semiclassical approximation does break down , and the precise locations and intensities of the spectral peaks may differ somewhat between the full quantum mechanics and the semiclassical approximation .",
    "there is some ambiguity in the definition of the semiclassical spectrum , due to the non - unitarity of the semiclassical propagator , which has eigenvalues that lie off the unit circle and possesses distinct left and right eigenstates .",
    "however , it seems possible to define the spectrum in such a way that the spectral statistics have the properties expected from the discussion above@xcite .",
    "the _ statistical _ properties of the quantum spectrum may be very similar to those predicted by the semiclassical approximation , even in the absence of detailed state - to - state agreement .      in a continuous - time conservative system , like a two - dimensional billiard",
    ", another relevant time scale is present in addition to those discussed previously .",
    "this scale is @xmath42 , the energy width of the initial wavepacket .",
    "clearly , the wavepacket only has a chance to overlap with those eigenstates which lie in the allowed energy range .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of an envelope of width @xmath42 in the spectrum that all subsequent oscillations have to multiply . in the time domain",
    ", this corresponds to the very short - time autocorrelation function , which measures the overlap of the initial wavepacket with itself before it has had a chance to travel a distance comparable with its width .",
    "this energy spread scales as @xmath182 . for a small wavepacket @xmath183 , much smaller than the system size @xmath184",
    ", this scale is well separated from the time of the shortest periodic orbit .",
    "this very short time overlap is then followed by a relatively long  quiet period \" in which @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "if the original wavepacket lives on a short periodic orbit , eventually a recurrence occurs corresponding to that orbit ( and producing an infinite series of bumps under the @xmath42 envelope ) , possibly followed by more quiet time and/or isolated homoclinic recurrences , and eventually random recurrences begin which must be convoluted with all that has come before . in the energy domain , this corresponds to a series of nested envelopes .",
    "of course , the quiet time mentioned above is present even in the absence of scarring , and leads to quantitative predictions about the absence of spectral fluctuations ( vanishing of the weighted form factor ) on those scales .",
    "in the preceding sections we have focused on scarring as measured by a gaussian wavepacket centered on a periodic point . this has led to criteria for scarring such as the distribution of the overlaps of this wavepacket with the eigenstates of the system , the inverse participation ratio , eigenstate - eigenvalue correlations , wavepacket form factors , and the distribution of long - time return probabilities .",
    "but we know from previous analysis of the linear approximation that scarring is associated not only with a periodic point but also with the direction of the classical stable and unstable manifolds near that point .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the hyperbolic nature of the classical dynamics should be seen in the quantum dynamics and in the eigenstates as well .",
    "but the gaussian wavepackets that we have been using so far carry no information even about the linear dynamics around the periodic point .",
    "this serves as motivation for replacing the elliptic wavepacket @xmath185 of eq .",
    "[ wavepkt ] with the coherent superposition of gaussians @xmath186 where @xmath187 and where @xmath188 is a time parameter , @xmath189 is a time cutoff , @xmath190 is a normalization factor , and @xmath191 is a gaussian given by eq .",
    "[ wavepkt ] .",

    ", @xmath192 knows about not only the the location of the fixed point , but also about the linear dynamics near that point .",
    "the extent to which @xmath192 differs from being an eigenstate of the full evolution is a measure of the nonlinear dynamics ( whereas the extent to which the original gaussian @xmath194 differed from being an eigenstate is primarily a measure of the linear instability around the periodic point ) .",
    "the states @xmath192 are the `` linear eigenstates '' ( they would be true eigenstates if the dynamics were purely linear hyperbolic about the fixed point ) . we can perform a very similar kind of analysis with @xmath192 as we did with the plain gaussians @xmath195 , in particular looking at the @xmath196 distribution , the inverse participation ratio , the autocorrelation function , and the spectrum .",
    "of course we must choose a value @xmath189 which is within the linearizable regime of the motion in order to get a sensible result .",
    "in this regime , the autocorrelation function for @xmath197 is given by @xmath198 we also want @xmath189 to be large compared to the decay time of the original gaussian wavepacket , if we are going to see the maximum enhancement of the scarring effect .",

    "we have not carried this out , but it seems likely to be relevant to the hyperbolic states discussed by nonnenmacher and voros@xcite .    linear eigenstate scarring can be viewed as one of a variety of approximation schemes , where one compares the approximate eigenstates with the eigenstates of the full system and looks for correlations between the two , which indicate that the approximation has some validity . in this sense ,",

    "long - time overlaps of gaussian wavepackets , as well as semiclassical spectra and eigenstates can be computed in an efficient manner ( for example , by fourier transforming to momentum variables and cutting off the high - frequency modes)@xcite .",
    "these calculations generally show good agreement with the quantum results , although the convergence is not uniform over phase space  @xcite . in particular , the semiclassical approximation does not see the  diffractive \" effects associated with the boundaries between classical strips .    to illustrate the effect of isolated returning orbits as discussed in section  [ isolrec ] , we construct a modified version of the system described above . a rectangle is divided into @xmath246 strips numbered @xmath247 .",

    "simultaneously strip @xmath254 for @xmath255 gets shifted to the right into strip @xmath256 , and similarly @xmath257 is shifted to the left into @xmath258 . in effect , we have two long corridors to the left and right of the hyperbolic region , each of which must be traversed in its entirety before one returns to the center , which is where all of the mixing occurs .",
    "this slows down the total mixing in phase space because each excursion away from strip @xmath224 takes at least @xmath184 steps .",
    "an effective symbolic dynamics using the three symbols ` @xmath224 ' , ` @xmath259 ' , and ` @xmath260 ' can be used to represent the trajectories , where ` @xmath260'@xmath261 , and similarly for ` @xmath259 ' . then for the periodic orbit @xmath262 ,",
    "the shortest homoclinic excursions involve @xmath184 steps , and are symbolically represented as @xmath263 and @xmath264 . on the other hand , the lyapunov exponent of the original orbit ( and therefore the decay time of the linear dynamics ) can be arranged to be of order unity , creating a clean separation of scales between the two effects .",
    "numerical results for this system will be presented towards the end of section  [ genbakernum ] .",
    "we now proceed to examine the numerical evidence for scarring in the three - strip generalized baker s map described in the previous section .",
    "we concentrate on the period one orbit @xmath226 , for which the particle stays always in the middle strip .",
    "the location of the fixed point is given by @xmath265 , and the lyapunov exponent is @xmath266 .",
    "an ensemble average can be performed over different strip widths @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 , and over the value of planck s constant @xmath270 . the integers @xmath271 , describing the dimensions of the subspaces corresponding to the three strips , are chosen to be prime to eliminate possible sources of anomalous behavior .",
    "( in the original baker s map , such anomalous behavior is associated with values of @xmath29 which are divisible by powers of 2 ; see for example ref .",
    "also , we demand @xmath272 to eliminate the parity symmetry . this parity symmetry , also present in the original baker s map and given by @xmath273 , would otherwise produce a factor of @xmath274 enhancement in the inverse participation ratio for the @xmath226 orbit , as explained in the concluding paragraph of section  [ heissym ] .",
    "for each of @xmath275 realizations of this system , the inverse participation ratio was computed for a circular wavepacket centered on the periodic point .",
    "the lyapunov exponent for the orbit ranged from a low value of @xmath276 ( corresponding to a linear ipr enhancement factor of @xmath277 according to eq .",

    "@xmath73 is obtained here by measuring the mean ipr for a wavepacket placed randomly in the phase space instead of on a periodic point .",
    "we see large fluctuations in this figure around the predicted behavior , but the overall linear trend is certainly correct .",
    "fluctuations in the amount of scarring at a given value of the lyapunov exponent are of the order of twenty percent around the mean .",
    "this level of variation in scarring strength from orbit to orbit is quite reasonable taking into account the fact that the effective number of spectral lines under the linear envelope is well under @xmath283 in most cases studied .",
    "( this effective dimension of the space in which the wavepacket lives is given by the total dimension @xmath29 divided by the ipr of the linear envelope . )    for a subset of @xmath284 out of this set of @xmath275 systems , the semiclassical ipr was also computed ( this is defined by the fluctuation of the _ right _ eigenstates of the time evolution ) .",
    "these values are shown on the same plot in figure  [ iprfig ] using the ` + ' symbol .",
    "the semiclassical ipr is correlated with but does not exactly follow the full quantum value .",
    "deviations from the predictions of the random statistical theory are present in the semiclassical as well as in the quantum calculation .",
    "this suggests that cases of excessive ( or deficient ) scarring must be associated with non - randomness in the new long - time recurrences , and not simply with a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "given the small number of parameters defining the system , and the finite dimension @xmath29 of the hilbert space , such occasional anomalous behavior is not very surprising .",
    "on the same figure , we also plot ( using triangles ) the results for a modified version of the generic baker s map , where random matrices have been substituted for the matrices @xmath285 and @xmath286 describing the dynamics of the left and right strips ( while leaving the behavior of the middle strip unchanged ) .",
    "this corresponds to explicitly randomizing the long - time recurrences , while preserving the constraint imposed by the short - time dynamics in the region of the fixed point .",
    "the full ipr in this case follows the same linear dependence on the short - time envelope prediction , but with a clearly smaller numerical coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that the generic wavepacket - averaged ( non - scarred ) value of the ipr for this system is smaller ( @xmath287 compared with @xmath282 for the true baker s map ) .",
    "in figure  [ iprvsn ] , the ratio between the actual ipr and the linearly predicted value is plotted ( squares ) as a function of the effective system size @xmath288 .",
    "we find significant fluctuations around the mean value of @xmath289 , with no evident trend as @xmath290 increases . in a random matrix theory model , fluctuations around the mean value of the ipr scale as @xmath291 , and this behavior",
    "is not inconsistent with the data , although the range of @xmath29 used is not sufficient to see the convergence .",
    "on the same figure , the corresponding ratio is plotted ( using triangles ) for the  randomized baker s map \" described in the previous paragraph . here",
    "the fluctuations around the mean are only slightly smaller than for the real baker s map ( their magnitude being about @xmath292 rather than @xmath293 percent ) .",
    "the mean value of the full - to - linear - ipr ratio is also smaller , as explained in the previous paragraph . for the explicitly randomized system ,",
    "the only correlations in the new long - time recurrences ( after having taken into account the short - time constraint ) are due to the finiteness of the hilbert space , and are expected to become insignificant in the @xmath294 limit .",
    "so far we have been focusing on the second moment of the spectral intensity distribution , for various realizations of the generalized baker s map system .",
    "we now turn to a specific system , for which we will be able to look at the entire spectrum and see explicitly the pattern of fluctuations around the linear envelope .",
    "we choose the first entry in our data file , with @xmath295 and three strips of widths @xmath296 , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 .",

    "[ iprval ] a linear envelope with an ipr of @xmath300 .",
    "the actual quantum value of the ipr is @xmath301 , so there is a heisenberg - time fluctuation factor of @xmath287 ( compared to the expected value @xmath282 ) .",
    "the semiclassically computed value for the ipr is somewhat larger , at @xmath302 .    the intensity spectrum for a circular wavepacket centered on the fixed point is plotted in figure  [ specfig]a , along with the linear envelope @xmath162 and an intermediate envelope obtained by fourier transforming @xmath113 for @xmath303 .",
    "the intermediate envelope corresponds to a time scale large compared to the linear decay time and mixing time of the system , but still small compared with the heisenberg time . a semiclassical version of this intermediate envelope is also plotted and is seen to be very similar to the full quantum computation . in figure  [ specfig ] , a portion of the line spectrum is compared with the same spectrum computed semiclassically .",
    "( again , the semiclassical spectrum is defined by taking the overlaps between the wavepacket and the right eigenstates of the semiclassical evolution .",
    "the imaginary parts of the semiclassical energies are ignored . ) in figure  [ specfig]c , the quantum spectrum of figure  [ specfig]a is now plotted after dividing out by the linear envelope .",
    "we see that the underlying oscillations around the envelope are in fact energy independent , and are equally strong near the peak and valley of the envelope .    in figure  [ histo ] ,",
    "a histogram of these scaled intensities is plotted , after averaging over several realizations of the system .",
    "this is compared to a similar histogram of the unscaled intensities .",
    "it is seen that the former comes much closer to obeying an exponential law as predicted by porter - thomas .    in figure",
    "[ ecorr ] , the spectral correlation function @xmath304 is plotted in the form of a histogram ( plusses ) , and compared to the correlation function for a scaled spectrum ( diamonds ) .",
    "an ensemble average and an average over the energy @xmath305 has been performed in each case .",
    "we can see that the correlation function for the scaled spectrum is uniform with small random fluctuations ( we ignore the large correlations for @xmath41 of the order of a mean level spacing , @xmath306 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "correlations in the unscaled spectrum are very striking , and sharply peaked near @xmath307 .    in figure  [ figisol ] , a spectrum with a linear and a second - order envelope is plotted for a system with isolated homoclinic recurrences , associated with excursions away from the mixing region as discussed at the end section  [ genbak ] .",

    "by focusing on the importance of nonlinear recurrences , long - time fluctuations , symmetry factors , and the local classical structure around a periodic orbit , we have attempted to clear up some of the long - standing mysteries in the literature on scarring .",
