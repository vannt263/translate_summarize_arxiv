    "recently , there has been increased interest in the theory of one - dimensional ( 1d ) imbalanced fermi systems , partly because of the relevance of these theories for the understanding of the fulde and ferrell  @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite ( fflo ) phase .",
    "the fflo is an exotic phase proposed approximately forty years ago , where atoms of opposite momenta and spins form cooper pairs with finite momentum . in spite of intense theoretical and experimental efforts ,",
    "the fflo phase remains elusive .    in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , in the strongly - interacting limit , experiments show  @xcite that the gas phase separates with an unpolarized superfluid core surrounded by a polarized shell  @xcite , with no evidence for the fflo phase  @xcite",
    ". however , in one - dimensional ( 1d ) imbalanced fermi gases , the observed density profiles  @xcite agree quantitatively well with theories that exhibit the 1d equivalent of fflo correlations at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "these experimental measurements  @xcite of density profiles of a two spin mixture of ultracold @xmath0 atoms trapped in an array of 1d tubes show that at finite spin imbalance , the system phase separates with an inverted phase profile as compared to the 3d case . in these 1d experiments a partially polarized core",
    "was observed surrounded by wings composed of either a completely paired or a fully polarized fermi gas , depending on the degree of polarization .",
    "this recent experimental observation of what can be seen as a strong candidate for fflo - like correlations in 1d has motivated theoretical investigations of possible mechanisms responsible for its stability",
    ". the increased stability of fflo - like phases in 1d can be understood as a nesting effect , where a single wavevector connects all points on the fermi surface , allowing all atoms on the fermi surface to participate in finite momentum pairing , while in 3d , only a small portion of these atoms are able to contribute .",
    "this 1d fermi surface nesting enhancement of the instability of the normal to the fflo state is analogous to the conventional charge density wave ( cdw ) instability  @xcite .    in the paring mechanism , besides the particle - particle channel considered by nozi ' eres and schmitt - rink ( nsr )  @xcite , there is a correction of the two - body pairing interactions considered first by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gmb )  @xcite .",
    "this correction accounts for the induced interactions which arise between atoms at the fermi level due to the polarization of the medium .",
    "it has been shown that these induced interactions suppress the superfluid transition temperature by a factor of about @xmath1 in 3d  @xcite and @xmath2 in 2d  @xcite spin - balanced fermi gases , respectively , when compared with the mean - field ( mf ) results .",
    "the gmb correction was considered recently in various situations as , for instance , in a spin - balanced fermi gas in an optical lattice @xcite , in a homogeneous three - components fermi gas @xcite , and in the unitary limit of spin - balanced @xcite and imbalanced 3d fermi gases @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the zero temperature ( t ) phase diagram of a quasi-1d imbalanced fermi system as a function of the mismatch @xmath3 between their fermi wavevectors  @xcite .",
    "this is relevant for the nearly 1d fermi gases we are interested in .",
    "we show that including induced interactions through a random phase approximation ( rpa ) is essential to correct the mf ( naive ) pairing fluctuations results , since they give rise to a finite critical field ( or mismatch ) separating a fully polarized phase from the fflo state , and in this way , to reveal the presence of the nesting effect in spin - imbalanced quasi-1d ( ideal ) fermi gases .",
    "it is possible to conceive in actual physical systems mechanisms by which the quasiparticle states in the normal phase acquire a finite lifetime .",
    "for example , due to different types of unknown ( or unrecognized ) scattering mechanisms not included in the pairing interaction , or due to an inhomogeneous distribution of the atoms in a trap . in condensed matter systems , for quasi - one dimensional superconductors , disorder may have a more mundane origin , as defects or impurities  @xcite .",
    "we assume the existence of weak inter - tube interactions so that the effects of localization are not so severe .",
    "we show here how this lifetime effect modifies the @xmath4 phase diagram of the 1d gas . in the limit of short lifetimes of the quasiparticle states in 1d",
    "we find a quantum phase transition from the normal - to - inhomogeneous superfluid as the fermi wave - vector mismatch is reduced from the normal phase .",
    "this @xmath4 transition is continuous or second order .",
    "it is associated with a qcp at a critical value of the field ( mismatch ) @xmath5 .",
    "we fully characterize this qcp obtaining its dynamic quantum critical exponent and universality class . on the other hand , for sufficiently long lifetimes ( weak disorder ) , lifetime effects turn out to be irrelevant and we recover the previous results of including only induced interactions .",
    "our results imply that for sufficiently strong disorder , the region in the phase diagram where the fflo phase exits is reduced without necessarily being destroyed , even in 1d .",
    "the instability of the normal state that we consider is that for a fflo superfluid state characterized by a single wave - vector @xmath6 .",
    "this is the first zero temperature instability that occurs as the effective zeeman field @xmath3 is reduced @xcite from the normal phase .",
    "the majority of the recent literature on 1d spin - imbalanced fermi gases considers the simplest possible system that exhibits fflo - type pairing namely , the yang - gaudin model or its lattice version , the hubbard model with attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "both models are exactly solvable ( or integrable ) and their energy spectra and thermodynamical properties can be calculated exactly using the bethe ansatz and numerical methods @xcite",
    ". the yang - gaudin model does not include inter - tube couplings and eventually it will be necessary to consider these @xcite to fully describe the experiments .",
    "the theoretical predictions and in particular the phase diagram obtained using the integrable yang - gaudin model @xcite agree very well with the experimentally observed density profiles and support the stability of the fflo phase in 1d .",
    "here we give a robust and transparent physical explanation of this stability as a consequence of nesting effects .",
    "we also show explicitly that the medium indubitably modifies the fermion - fermion interaction g , due to many - body effects an effect which can not be clearly seen in the exact approaches .",
    "we point out that our results including induced interactions are consistent with the exact results since , for long lifetimes , we find a direct transition from the fully polarized to the fflo state .",
    "this is not surprising since the physics of this problem is determined by the nesting effect which is present in both approaches , either explicitly or implicitly .",
    "our study is based on calculations of pair and density fluctuations , i.e. , of the particle - particle ( pair ) and particle - hole susceptibilities , respectively , that certainly are present in a fermi gas , in any dimension . in 1d",
    "these two physical quantities are of extreme importance , since both diverge , which are indications of some order in the system .",
    "as will be shown below , our main results do not depend on the particular hamiltonian used to describe the attractive fermionic gas .",
    "rather they arise from fundamental quantities , namely the 1d fermionic dispersion relations that always can be linearized close to the fermi points , regardless of its precise nature , and the subsequent calculation of the particle - hole and particle - particle susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "thus , given that it is of fundamental importance to consider the fermi surface properties at 1d or , the particle - particle and particle - hole interactions near it , our results can be considered as model independent . in this sense , our approach is complementary to those previous studies based on the real space yang - gaudin and hubbard models .",
    "to begin , let us consider a non - relativistic dilute ( i.e. , the particles interact through a short - range attractive interaction ) 1d spin - polarized fermi gas , described by the following single - channel model hamiltonian    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath10 particles ( and the same for the @xmath11 particles ) and @xmath12 are their dispersion relation , defined by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the chemical potential of the non - interacting @xmath16-species , @xmath17 .",
    "a special case described by this hamiltonian is that of identical spin @xmath18 particles under an external magnetic field @xmath3 . in this case , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the spin up and spin down bands with their degeneracy raised by the magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion relations are then given by @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , we will approximate the dispersions around their fermi energies by @xmath20 , since the relevant states are near the fermi momenta .",
    "@xmath21 is the fermi velocity . for future notation , we rewrite this equation as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the fermi wave - vectors of the different particles or bands .",
    "an important parameter in the present study is the _ fermi wave - vector mismatch _ , @xmath24 .",
    "to reflect an attractive ( s - wave ) interaction between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 we take @xmath25 .",
    "in this section we consider quasi-1d imbalanced fermi system as a function of the mismatch @xmath3 between their chemical potentials in the ideal case , i.e. , in the absence of lifetime effects .",
    "our aim is to investigate the quantum phase transition from the normal - to - inhomogeneous fflo superfluid phase as the fermi wave - vector mismatch is reduced from the normal polarized state .      since in a homogeneous 1d system",
    "the quantum phase transition to the fflo phase is continuous  @xcite , we expand the action in fluctuations , @xmath26 , and obtain @xcite ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the external momemtum of the particle - particle bubble diagram and @xmath30 the pair susceptibility ,    @xmath31    or @xmath32 \\\\",

    "this expression diverges for @xmath46 i.e. , for @xmath47 , yielding @xmath48 .",
    "since the two species fermi momenta can be written as @xmath49 , their difference is @xmath50 , and we find that at the critical mismatch the pair wave vector reads @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the calculation above shows that fflo type of correlations are so strong in quasi-1d systems with attractive interactions , that differently from d = 2  @xcite and d = 3  @xcite , in 1d the fflo phase persists even in the presence of an arbitrarily large magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "however , we show below that including induced interactions substantially modifies this scenario and there is a finite @xmath52 beyond which fflo correlations disappear .",
    "this field coincides with that at which the system becomes fully polarized in agreement with the exact results @xcite .",
    "nsr have shown that as the superconducting transition temperature @xmath53 is approached from above , cooper pair fluctuations grow in amplitude , and the pair susceptibility ( which measures the tendency of pairs to form in response to an external pair field ) diverges .",
    "the pair fluctuation is expressed by the pair susceptibility of eq .",
    "( [ chi1 - 1 ] ) , and nsr showed that @xmath54 is simply the thouless condition for weak coupling superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "besides the pairing fluctuations that must be taken into account , as pointed out by nsr , to obtain the correct superfluid transition temperature @xmath53 of the bec - bcs crossover , there is another effect of particle - hole fluctuations that affects the superfluid state .",
    "namely , there is a change in the coefficient @xmath55 due to screening of the interspecies ( or induced ) interaction , known as the gmb correction  @xcite . in the bec side , the nsr fluctuation is dominant , while the gmb fluctuation becomes weaker towards the bec side and vanishes in this region due to the disappearance of the fermi surface  @xcite .    in the original work by gmb",
    "@xcite , the induced interaction was obtained in the bcs limit by second - order perturbation  @xcite . the diagram in fig .",
    "[ rpa ] , describes a scattering process in which the conservation of total momentum implies that @xmath56 . besides , the frequencies and momentum are set to zero , so that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to the induced interaction @xmath59  @xcite , where @xmath60 is the particle - hole susceptibility , @xmath61 is a vector in the space of wave - vector @xmath62 and fermion matsubara frequency @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the term @xmath65 describes the modification of the inter - particle interaction @xmath66 due to many - body effects ( i.e. , the presence of other particles ) .    in general ,",
    "if the number of electrons in the band is such that the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath67 is well - behaved , or in dimensions higher than 1 where @xmath67 does not diverge , the second order term in the induced interaction is sufficient to describe the system and calculate the change of the critical parameters . however , for general cases the gmb treatment can be extended to a region where all orders are important , and one has to sum an infinite series of the diagram represented in fig .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) diverges ( a similarly condition holds for @xmath106 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , meaning that both scattering particles are at the fermi surface .",
    "notice that in metallic systems , the divergence of @xmath109 for a given value of @xmath66 is often related to an instability to a charge ordered phase  @xcite .",
    "the result above shows that even in the presence of an external magnetic field , the particle - hole susceptibility diverges at the same value of @xmath110 , as in the absence of the `` field '' @xmath3 , namely for @xmath111 .",
    "considering particle - hole fluctuations , we replace @xmath66 by @xmath112 and the instability condition for the superconducting phase is given by : @xmath113 it can be easily verified from this equation that the wave vector for which this condition is first satisfied is still given by @xmath114 , which gives a critical field @xmath115 .",
    "an interesting and new possibility occurs when @xmath116 .",
    "however , this is possible if , and only if , @xmath117 .",
    "then , we conclude that the many - body effects brought about by the nesting wave vector @xmath118 which connects the two fermi points @xmath119 and @xmath120 gives rise a new effective @xmath11 species fermi surface , @xmath121 , with @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from the divergence of the particle - hole susceptibility and eq .",
    "( [ induce ] ) that the effective interaction is @xmath123 .",
    "this situation @xmath124 , as we just verified , corresponds to the fully polarized gas .",

    "see , for instance  @xcite , where the ground state energy expression for a homogeneous system is given in terms of spectral functions , which in turn are solutions of two coupled integral equations .",
    "the main results presented in  @xcite for a homogeneous 1d imbalanced fermi gas with fixed total density @xmath136 and density difference @xmath137 , with @xmath138 are : for @xmath139 , the ground state of the system is a fully paired ( bcs ) state . for @xmath140",
    "the system is a fully polarized gas consisting of solely @xmath141 fermions . and finally , for any @xmath142 the gas is partially polarized and is a superfluid of the fflo type .",
    "these are exactly the same results we have obtained , as a manifestation of the nesting effect .",
    "we stress that since the nesting effect is a intrinsic and universal phenomena in 1d fermi systems  @xcite it should be properly considered , as we did here .    .",

    "the quantum phase transition in this case is directly from the fully polarized state to a phase with fflo correlations @xcite .",
    "the nature of the quantum phase transitions in the pure case of infinite lifetime have been investigated by guan and ho  @xcite and at least for the case they are driven by changes in the chemical potential they belong to the universality class of density - driven transitions with dynamic exponent @xmath146 and @xmath147 as in the case of the repulsive 1d hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "in this section we study lifetime effects ( lt ) in the phase diagram of 1d attractive imbalanced fermi gases . in cold atom systems",
    "the trap to confine the atoms gives rise to an inhomogeneous atomic distribution , which can be described , for example , by a chemical potential , which depends on the distance from the center of the trap . in this case , since translation invariance is broken , the momentum or wave - vector @xmath110 is not the good quantum number to describe the quasi - particle states in the trap .",
    "however , it is still convenient to use this representation , in which case it is appropriate to introduce a finite lifetime to these states . in the quasi - one - dimensional organic superconductors",
    "@xcite , life - time effects arise from impurities or defects .    taking into account the finite lifetime of the quasi - particle states in the momentum representation ,",
    "the particle - particle dynamic susceptibility can be written as , @xcite where @xmath148 is the inverse of the lifetime of a quasiparticle @xmath149-state in the normal phase .",
    "this approach is formally similar to that used to investigate the effect of non - magnetic impurities in higher dimensional ( 3d and 2d ) fflo superconductors @xcite . in this case",
    "the main interest was to obtain the reduction in the critical temperature of the superconductor . here",
    "we will concentrate in the zero temperature phase diagram of the 1d system and will be able to fully characterize the new qcp that arises due to the lifetime effects .",

    "taking into account the results of the previous section we can summarize our results as :    * if @xmath160 , where @xmath52 was calculated in the previous section , the lifetime effect is irrelevant and the phase transition occurs at @xmath52 directly from the fully polarized state to the fflo phase . * for short lifetimes , or strong disorder , such that , @xmath161 , the transition to the fflo phase occurs from a partially polarized state . in this case",
    "there is an intervening normal partially polarized ( pp ) phase between the fully polarized ( fp ) state and the fflo phase ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the results above do not arise from a mf calculation , but rather on the properties of the pair and density fluctuations that go beyond the mf approximation .",
