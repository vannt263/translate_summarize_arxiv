    "as a famous distance measure in the field of abstract spaces , frchet distance was first defined by maurice frchet a century ago @xcite .",
    "alt and godau first used it in measuring the similarity of polygonal chains in 1992 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the frchet distance between two two - dimensional ( 2d ) polygonal chains ( polylines ) can be computed in polynomial time @xcite , and even under translation or rotation ( though the running time is much higher ) @xcite . in three - dimensional space ( 3d ) , wenk should that given two chains with sum of length @xmath3 , the minimum frchet distance between them can be computed in @xmath4 time , where @xmath5 is the degree of freedom for moving the chains @xcite .",
    "so with translation alone this minimum frchet distance can be computed in in @xmath6 time , and when both translation and rotation are allowed the corresponding minimum frchet distance can be computed in @xmath7 time .",
    "these results can be generalized to any fixed dimensions @xcite .",
    "while computing ( approximating ) frchet distance for surfaces is in general np - hard @xcite , it is polynomially solvable for restricted surfaces @xcite .    in 1994 , eiter and mannila defined the",
    "_ discrete frchet distance _ between two polygonal chains @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in any fixed dimensions ) and it turns out that this simplified distance is always realized by two vertices in @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "they also showed that with dynamic programming the discrete frchet distance between them can be computed in @xmath10 time .",
    "recently , jiang , xu and zhu applied the discrete frchet distance in ( globally ) aligning the backbones of proteins ( which is called the _ protein structure - structure alignment _ or more generally , the _ protein global alignment _",
    "problem ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this application the discrete frchet distance makes more sense as the backbone of a protein is simply a polygonal chain in 3d , with each vertex being the alpha - carbon atom of a residue .",
    "so if the ( continuous ) frchet distance is realized by an alpha - carbon atom and some other point which does not represent an atom , it is not meaningful biologically .",
    "jiang , _ et al .",
    "_ showed that given two 2d ( or 3d ) polygonal chains the minimum discrete frchet distance between them , under both translation and rotation , can be computed in polynomial time .",
    "they also applied some ideas therein to design an efficient heuristic for the original protein structure - structure alignment problem in 3d and the empirical results showed that their alignment is more accurate compared with previously known solutions .",
    "in essence , the result of jiang , xu and zhu @xcite implies that the protein global alignment problem , which is to find all proteins in a given set @xmath11 similar to a query protein or some protein in @xmath11 ( under translation and rotation ) , is polynomially solvable .",
    "however , very little algorithmic / complexity results is known regarding the protein local structure alignment problem .",
    "the only such recent result was due to qian , _ et al . _ who showed that under the rmsd distance the problem is np - complete but admits a ptas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there have been lots of experimental / heuristic methods with practical systems since 1989 , e.g. , ssap @xcite , dali @xcite , cath @xcite , ce @xcite , scop @xcite , mammoth @xcite and tali @xcite . in this paper , we show that if many proteins are given then the local structure alignment problem , under the discrete frchet distance , is very hard ; on the other hand , if only a small number of proteins are given then there is a polynomial time solution for the problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce some basic definitions regarding frchet  distance and review some known results . in section 3 ,",
    "we show the hardness result for the protein local structure alignment problem . in section 4 , we show how to solve the problem when @xmath0 is a constant . in section 5",
    ", we conclude the paper with several open problems .",
    "given two 3d polygonal chains @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 vertices respectively , we aim at measuring the similarity of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( possibly under translation and rotation ) such that their distance is minimized under certain measure . among the various distance measures ,",
    "the hausdorff distance is known to be better suited for matching two point sets than for matching two polygonal chains ; the ( continuous ) frchet  distance is a superior measure for matching two polygonal chains , but it is not quite easy to compute @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be the euclidean space @xmath16 ; let @xmath17 denote the euclidean distance between two points @xmath18 .",
    "the ( continuous ) frchet  distance between two parametric curves @xmath19\\to x$ ] and @xmath20\\to x$ ] is @xmath21 } d(f(\\alpha(s)),g(\\beta(s))),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 range over all continuous non - decreasing real functions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "imagine that a person and a dog walk along two different paths while connected by a leash ; moreover , they always move forward , possibly at different paces .",
    "intuitively , the minimum possible length of the leash is the frchet  distance between the two paths .",
    "to compute the frchet  distance between two polygonal curves @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in the euclidean plane ) of @xmath26 and @xmath27 vertices , respectively , alt and godau @xcite presented an @xmath28 time algorithm .",
    "later this bound was reduced to @xmath29 time @xcite .",
    "we now define the discrete frchet  distance following @xcite .    given a polygonal chain ( polyline ) in 3d , @xmath30 @xmath31 of @xmath32 vertices , a * @xmath0-walk * along @xmath33 partitions the path into @xmath0 disjoint non - empty subchains @xmath34 such that @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "given two 3d polylines @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 , a * paired walk * along @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a @xmath0-walk @xmath42 along @xmath8 and a @xmath0-walk @xmath43 along @xmath9 for some @xmath0 , such that , for @xmath44 , either @xmath45 or @xmath46 ( that is , @xmath47 or @xmath48 contains exactly one vertex ) .",
    "the * cost * of a paired walk @xmath49 along two paths @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath50    the * discrete frchet  distance * between two polylines @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath51 the paired walk that achieves the discrete frchet  distance between two paths @xmath8 and @xmath9 is also called the * frchet  alignment * of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    consider the scenario in which the person walks ( jumps ) along @xmath8 and the dog along @xmath9 .",
    "intuitively , the definition of the paired walk is based on three cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath52 : the person stays and the dog moves ( jumps ) forward ; 2 .",
    "@xmath53 : the person moves ( jumps ) forward and the dog stays ; 3 .",
    "@xmath54 : both the person and the dog move ( jump ) forward .    .",
    "the relationship between discrete and continuous frchet  distances .",
    "eiter and mannila presented a simple dynamic programming algorithm to compute @xmath55 in @xmath56 time @xcite .",
    "recently , jiang ,  showed that the minimum discrete frchet  distance between two chains in 2d , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , under translation can be computed in @xmath57 time , and under both translation and rotation it can be computed in @xmath58 time @xcite .",
    "for 3d chains these bounds are @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively @xcite .",
    "they are significantly faster than the corresponding bounds for the continuous frchet  distance ( certainly due to a simpler distance structure ) , which are @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively for 3d chains @xcite",
    ".    we comment that while the discrete frchet  distance could be arbitrarily larger than the corresponding continuous frchet  distance ( e.g. , in fig .  1 ( i ) , they are @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively ) , by adding sample points on the polylines , one can easily obtain a close approximation of the continuous frchet  distance using the discrete frchet  distance ( e.g. , one can use @xmath64 in fig .  1 ( ii ) to approximate @xmath63 ) .",
    "this fact was pointed before in @xcite and is supported by the fact that the segments in protein backbones are mostly of similar lengths . moreover , the discrete frchet  distance is a more natural measure for matching the geometric shapes of biological sequences such as proteins . as we mentioned in the introduction , in such an application , continuous frchet  does not make much sense to biologists .    in the remaining part of this paper , for the first time , we investigate the locally aligning a set of polygonal chains ( proteins or protein backbones ) in 3d , under the discrete frchet distance .",
    "given a set of proteins modeled as simple 3d polygonal chains , the protein local structure alignment ( plsa ) problem is defined as follows .",
    "* instance : * given a set @xmath0 of proteins @xmath65 , @xmath66 , ... , @xmath67 in 3d , each with length @xmath1 , and a real number @xmath68 .",
    "+ * problem : * does there exist a chain @xmath69 of @xmath32 vertices such that the vertices of @xmath69 are from @xmath70 s , and @xmath69 and a subsequence of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) has discrete frchet distance at most @xmath68 ( under translation and rotation ) ? + if no translation and rotation is allowed , we call the corresponding problem _ static _ plsa . for the optimal version of the problem , we wish to maximize @xmath32 when @xmath68 is given .",
    "the ( polynomial - time ) approximation solution will also be referred to as approximating the optimal solution value @xmath72 when it is hard to compute exactly .",
    "we will see that it is also hard to approximate @xmath72 even for static plsa .",
    "we first prove the following theorem .    given @xmath73 , the static plsa problem does not admit any approximation of factor @xmath2 unless p = np .",
    "it is easy to see that plsa belongs to np .",
    "we use a reduction from independent set to the protein local structure alignment problem .",
    "independent set is a well known np - complete problem which can not be approximated within a factor of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the general idea is similar to that of the longest common subsequence problem for multiple sequences @xcite , but our details are much more involved due to the geometric properties of the problem .    given a graph @xmath74 , we construct @xmath75 3d chains @xmath76 as follows .",
    "( we assume that the vertices and edges in @xmath77 are sorted by their corresponding indices . )",
    "the overall reduction is as follows : @xmath78 , and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a 3d point for @xmath81 .    for each @xmath82 in @xmath77",

    "we claim that @xmath77 has an independent set of size @xmath32 if and only if there is a chain @xmath69 of @xmath32 vertices such that the discrete frchet distance between @xmath69 and a subsequence of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is at most @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",

    "let the independent set of @xmath77 be ordered as @xmath90 with @xmath91 . for @xmath92 ,",
    "we scan @xmath86 in a greedy fashion to obtain the first @xmath93 or @xmath94 such that the first component of its coordinate is @xmath95 .",
    "repeat this process to obtain @xmath87 . then let any @xmath87 be @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , @xmath69 has @xmath32 vertices and @xmath89 for @xmath96 .",
    "if there is a chain @xmath69 of @xmath32 vertices such that the discrete frchet distance between @xmath69 and a subsequence of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is at most @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath97 , then we can see the following .    * property ( a ) * let @xmath98 , then @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .",

    "( in other words , the man walking on @xmath69 and the dog walking on @xmath87 must move / jump together at each vertex . otherwise , @xmath106 . )",
    "we now claim that the ( ordered ) vertices of @xmath69 correspond to an independent set @xmath107 of @xmath77 ; moreover , if @xmath108 and @xmath109 , then @xmath110 .",

    "an example of @xmath127 is shown in figure 1 as well , in which case black nodes are on the @xmath128 plane and white nodes are on the @xmath129 plane ( apparently for the visualization reason , the xy - plane is slanted ) .",

    ", the optimal local alignment @xmath131 matches @xmath127 at its subsequence @xmath132 .",
    "given @xmath73 and when both translation and rotation are allowed , the ( maximization version of ) plsa problem does not admit any approximation of factor @xmath2 unless p = np .",
    "due to property ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , translation / rotation will not be able to generate another @xmath133 which is topologically different from @xmath69 .",
    "notice that in our proof all the adjacent vertices in @xmath69 could be non - adjacent in @xmath70 , for @xmath134 .",
    "biologically , this might be a problem as one residue alone sometimes can not carry out any biological function .",
    "define a @xmath135-_substring _ or a @xmath135-_subchain _ of @xmath70 as a continuous subchain of @xmath70 with at least @xmath135 vertices .",
    "unfortunately , even if we introduce this condition by forcing that @xmath69 is composed of @xmath32 ordered @xmath135-substrings of each @xmath70 , for some constant @xmath135 , the above proof can be modified to maintain a valid reduction from independent set . call this corresponding problem protein @xmath135-local structure alignment ( pclsa ) , in which @xmath69 must be composed of @xmath32 ordered @xmath135-subchains of each @xmath70 .",

    "the maximization version of pclsa does not admit any approximation of factor @xmath2 unless p = np .",
    "in this section , we present a polynomial time solution for the plsa problem when @xmath0 is a constant . we first show a dynamic programming solution for the static plsa and then we show how to use that as a subroutine for the general plsa problem , when @xmath0 is small .      in this subsection , we present a dynamic programming solution for the static plsa problem when @xmath0 is small .",
    "such a solution can be used as a subroutine for the general plsa problem .",
    "we first consider the case when @xmath136 .",
    "besides @xmath69 , we try to maximize the length of the aligned subsequences in @xmath137 and @xmath138 with @xmath139 . for the ease of description ,",
    "we only show how to obtain these lengths which are stored in @xmath140 $ ] and @xmath141 $ ] respectively .",
    "it is easy to reconstruct @xmath69 from these arrays .",

    "@xmath154    where @xmath155 and @xmath156    the boundary cases are handled as follows .",
    "@xmath157    the final solution value is stored in @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "we have the following theorem .    when @xmath136 , the static plsa problem can be solved in @xmath159 time and space .",
    "it is easy to generalize this algorithm to the more general case when @xmath0 is some constant .",
    "we thus have the following corollary .",
    "when @xmath0 is a constant , the static plsa problem can be solved in @xmath160 time and @xmath161 space .",
    "apparently , for any solution for plsa we should allow translation and rotation . when @xmath136 and when both translation and rotation are allowed , we can use a method similar to that in @xcite to compute the optimal local alignment with fixed @xmath85 .",
    "the idea is as follows . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath8 is static and we translate / rotate @xmath9 and let @xmath162 be the copy of @xmath9 after some translation / rotation .",
    "let @xmath139 and let @xmath5 be the degree of freedom for moving @xmath9 . as we are in 3d and both translation and rotation are allowed , we have @xmath163 .",
    "we can enumerate all possible configurations for @xmath8 and @xmath162 to realize a discrete frchet distance of @xmath85 .",
    "there are @xmath164 number of such configurations , following an argument similar to @xcite .",
    "then for each configuration , we can use the above theorem 4.1 to obtain the optimal local alignment for each configuration and finally we simply return the overall optimal solution .    when @xmath136 and when both translation and rotation are allowed , the plsa problem can be solved in @xmath165 time and @xmath166 space .",
    "we comment that when @xmath0 is larger , but still a constant , the above idea can be carried over so that we will still be able to solve plsa in polynomial time .",
    "it follows from @xcite that we have @xmath167 number of configurations between the @xmath0 chains .",
    "then we can again use corollary 4.1 to obtain the optimal local alignment for each configuration .",
    "the overall complexity would be @xmath168 time and @xmath161 space .",
    "certainly , such an algorithm is only meaningful in theory .",
    "when @xmath0 is a constant and when both translation and rotation are allowed , the plsa problem can be solved in @xmath169 time and @xmath161 space .",
    "in this paper , for the first time , we study the complexity / algorithmic aspects of the famous protein local structure alignment problem under the discrete frchet  distance . we show that the general problem is np - complete ; in fact , it is even np - hard to approximate within a factor of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "when a constant number of proteins are given then the problem can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "it would be interesting to see the empirical comparisons of protein local structure alignment under the discrete frchet  distance with the existing methods .",
