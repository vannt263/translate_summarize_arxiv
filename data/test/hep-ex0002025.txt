    "according to the quark - parton model , hadrons produced via @xmath1 collisions are characterized by the annihilation of @xmath1 pairs into a virtual @xmath2 or @xmath3 boson . in the lowest order",
    ", one defines the ratio of the rate of hadron production to that for muon pairs as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fractional charge of the quark , and the factor of 3 in front counts the three colors for each flavor .",
    "@xmath6 is the cross section of the pure qed process .",
    "the value of @xmath0 , which counts directly the number of quarks , their flavor and colors , is expected to be constant so long as the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of the annihilated @xmath1 does not overlap with resonances or thresholds for the production of new quark flavors .",

    "the higher order qcd corrections to @xmath0 have been calculated in complete 3rd order perturbation theory @xcite , and the results can be expressed as @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "precise measurement of @xmath0 at higher energy can be employed to determine @xmath10 according to eq.2 , which exhibits a qcd correction known to @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , non - perturbative corrections could be important at low cm energy , particularly in the resonance region .",
    "@xmath0 has been measured by many laboratories in the energy region from hadron production threshold to the @xmath3 pole and recently to the energy of w pair production @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xmath0-values are in general consistent with theoretical predictions , which is an impressive confirmation of the hypothesis of the three color degrees of freedom for quarks .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 in the low energy region were performed 15 to 20 years ago in novosibirsk , orsay , frascati , slac and hamburg  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rto10 ]  @xcite shows the @xmath0-values for cm energies up to 10 gev , including resonances . for cm energies below 5 gev , the uncertainties in @xmath0-values are about  15% on average ; and the structure in the charm threshold region is not well determined .",
    "the dasp group  @xcite inferred the existence of narrow resonances at 4.04 gev and 4.16 gev .",
    "in addition to the resonance at 3.77 gev , mark i data  @xcite shows broad enhancements at 4.04 , 4.2 and 4.4 gev .",
    "the resonance at 4.4 gev was also observed by pluto  @xcite , but the height and width of the resonance were reported differently .",
    "a new cross section measurement in the charm threshold region is needed to clarify the structure , which is important not only for the precision determination of @xmath12 and the interpretation of the @xmath13 measurement of e821 at bnl but also for the understanding of charmonium itself .    between the charm and bottom thresholds , i.e. , about 5 - 10.4 gev ,",
    "@xmath0 was measured by mark i , dasp , pluto , crystal ball , lena , cleo , cusb , and desy - heidelberg collaborations .",
    "their systematic normalization uncertainties were about 5 - 10% .",
    "above bottom threshold , the measurements were from pep , petra and lep with uncertainties of 2 - 7% .",
    "0.5 cm    .r in low energy measured by different laboratories [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : r1998 ]    the @xmath0 values for @xmath14 below 4 gev are in good agreement with results from @xmath15 @xcite and pluto @xcite but are below those from mark i @xcite .",
    "above 4 gev , our values are consistent with previous measurements .",
    "preliminary @xmath0-values at 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 , 2.7 , 2.8 , 2.9 , 3.0 , 4.6 and 4.8 gev are plotted with solid squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : r99 ] . the preliminary errors , which add the statistical and systematical errors in quadrature , are all conservatively assigned to be 10%",
    ". however , it is believed that these errors can be decreased to be comparable to the error bars of the solid dots , i.e. @xmath16 for the energy points below 3.6 gev and @xmath17 for energies above 4.5 gev .",
    "the first scan repeated 3.4 gev and the second scan repeated 2.6 and 4.6 gev data points measured in the first scan . in all case , @xmath0-values obtained are consistent with each other at the same energy .",
    "snd and cmd-2 at vepp-2 m have significantly improved the measurements of the hadron production cross section via @xmath1 collisions for some of the important exclusive channels in the energy region of 0.36 - 1.38 gev .",
    "further improvement with the analysis of the existing data is forthcoming . a major advance would be possible if the energy region could be extended to 2 gev , which would link up to the lowest energy of bepc .",
    "cmd-2 and snd at vepp-2 m are planning to scan from threshold to 1.4 gev in 1999 - 2000 . a @xmath0 scan between 2 to 10 gev with kedr at vepp-4",
    "is proposed .",
    "a scan covering such a wide energy region with the same machine and detector would be very important if the measurement could be performed with a @xmath18 precision .",
    "the @xmath0 scan performed with besii at bepc in beijing can significantly reduce the uncertainties in @xmath0 in the energy region 2 - 5 gev .",
    "the @xmath0-values from the first run data have already reduced the uncertainties in @xmath0 from 15 - 20% to 7% .",
    "besii at bepc in beijing is analyzing the second run @xmath0 scan data . the preliminary @xmath0 values in the whole energy region of 2 - 5",
    "gev are expected to be shown in the spring of 2000 , and the final results will be presented in the summer of 2000 .    the new @xmath0 ratio results in @xmath1 annihilations presented from novosibirsk and beijing have had a great impact on the value of @xmath19 . using these new ( albeit , preliminary ) results , a.d .",

    "re - evaluate @xmath19 and find @xmath20 or @xmath21 , according to whether inclusive or exclusive cross sections are used .",
    "the uncertainties here are already decreased more than half if we compare with the previous value of @xmath22 evalued by using the old experimental @xmath0-values  @xcite . with the final results from the beijing inclusive measurement in the whole 2 - 5 gev region and",
    "the more precise results from novosibirsk , @xmath19 and @xmath23 will be even more precisely determined from the experimental data .",
    "a dedicated energy scan , aimed at a 1% precision direct measurement below 1.4 gev , planned by kloe at dapne is not possible in the short term since the dafne machine is tuned for the @xmath24 resonance .",
    "however a machine upgrade is foreseen which will hopefully permit such an energy scan around 2004 .",
    "another method to measure the hadronic cross section is to measure events with initial state radiation ( isr ) . in this case one of the electrons or positrons of the beam radiates a hard photon and the cm energy of the hadronic system in the final state , mostly pions coming from the @xmath25-resonance , is lowered .",
    "kloe has already started the analysis of those events  @xcite .",
    "being one of the most fundamental parameters in particle physics , the @xmath0-value plays an important role in the development of the theory of particle physics and in testing the standard model .",
    "experimental efforts to precisely measure @xmath0-values at low energies are crucial for the future electroweak precision physics .",
    "the measurements are not only important for the evaluation of @xmath19 and for the interpretation of @xmath23 , but also necessary for the understanding of the hadron production mechanism via @xmath1 annihilation",
    ". a real breakthrough in electroweak theory physics with regard to the @xmath0-values at low energy would be possible only by measuring @xmath26 at @xmath18 accuracy .",
    "such a level of precision requires significant improvement to both machine and detector , and needs better theoretical calculation of the radiative correction and the event generator for hadron production .",
    "once the @xmath0-values has been measured with a precision of  1% in the energies covered by vepp-2 m and dapne , the central question will be how to further decrease the uncertainties of @xmath0-values measured by besii in the energy region of 2 - 5 gev , particularly from 2 - 3.7 gev .",
    "such a measurement would be extremely important for the interpretation of the @xmath23 experiment carrying out by e821 at bnl and for the precision determination of @xmath19 .",
    "this measurement would then be an important and attractive physics program for a @xmath27-c factory .",
