    "the twin paradox ( twp ) theorem is one of the most famous predictions of special relativity . according to twp ,",
    "if a twin makes a journey into space , he will return to find that he has aged less than his twin brother who stayed at home .",
    "however surprising twp is , it is not a contradiction .",
    "it is only a fact that shows that the concept of time is not as simple as it seems to be .",
    "a more optimistic consequence of twp is the following .",
    "suppose you would like to visit a distant galaxy 200 light years away .",
    "you are told it is impossible because even light travels there for 200 years .",
    "but you do not despair , you accelerate your spaceship nearly to the speed of light",
    ". then you travel there in 1 year of your ( proper ) time .",
    "you study there whatever you wanted , and you come back in 1 year .",
    "when you arrive back , you aged only 2 years .",
    "so you are happy , but of course you can not tell the story to your brother , who stayed on earth .",
    "alas you can tell it to your grand-  -grand - children only . in this way twp",
    "also makes time travel to the future possible .    in this paper",
    "we use the axiomatic method to provide a logic - based conceptual analysis of the twp theorem .",
    "we work within the first - order logic ( fol ) framework of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we logically compare twp and a prediction ( slowing down of moving clocks ) as well as a symmetry axiom of special relativity .",
    "this analysis is based on our geometrical characterization of twp , see theorem [ thm - twp ] .",
    "we show that twp is logically weaker than the assumption of the slowing down of moving clocks , see theorem [ thm - slowtime ] .",
    "we also show that twp is logically weaker than a symmetry axiom of special relativity , see theorem [ thm - simdist ] .",
    "since we prove our geometrical characterization in a general kinematics setting , we can use it to derive consequences on newtonian kinematics too .",
    "we show that the absoluteness of time ( in the newtonian sense ) is not equivalent to the lack of the twin paradox ( no - twp ) without assuming a strong theoretical axiom , see theorem [ thm - univtime ]",
    ".    why is it useful to apply the axiomatic method to relativity theory ?",
    "for one thing , this method makes it possible to understand the role of any particular axiom .",
    "we can check what happens to our theory if we drop , weaken or replace an axiom .",
    "for instance , it has been shown by this method that the impossibility of faster than light motion is not independent from other assumptions of special relativity , see @xcite , @xcite . more boldly : it is superfluous as an axiom because it is provable as a theorem from much simpler and more convincing basic assumptions .",
    "the linearity of transformations between inertial observers ( inertial reference frames ) can also be proven from some plausible assumptions , therefore it need not be assumed as an axiom , see @xcite , @xcite .    the usual approaches to special theory of relativity base the theory on two postulates , namely , einstein s principle of relativity and that the velocity of light is independent of its source .",
    "some authors give a mathematical argument to prove that einstein s principle of relativity implies the second postulate , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches contain several tacit assumptions besides the named postulates .",
    "so from the point of view of axiomatic foundations of relativity theory , they are not explicit enough . in an adequate axiomatic foundational work it is desirable to state every assumption explicitly .",
    "getting rid of unnecessary axioms of a physical theory is important because we do not know whether an axiom is true or not , we just assume so",
    ". we can only be sure of outcomes of concrete experiments but they rather correspond to ( existentially quantified ) theorems and not to axioms .",
    "in the literature it is common to use the term `` empirical fact '' for universal generalization of an empirical fact ( elevated to the level of axioms ) , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , because of their falsifiability it would be better to call them empirical axioms ( postulates based on outcomes of concrete experiments ) .    similarly , if we axiomatize a theory , we can ask which axioms are responsible for a certain prediction of the theory .",
    "this kind of reverse thinking helps to answer the why - type questions of relativity .",
    "for example , we can take the twin paradox and check which axiom of special relativity was and which one was not needed to derive it .",
    "the weaker an axiom system is , the better answer it offers to the question : `` why is the twin paradox true ? '' . for details on answering why - type questions of relativity by the methodology of the present work ,",
    "see @xcite . for further reasons why to apply the axiomatic method to spacetime theories , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    applying mathematical logic in foundations of relativity theories",
    "is not a new idea at all .",
    "it goes back to such leading mathematicians and philosophers as hilbert , reichenbach , carnap , gdel , tarski , suppes and friedman , among others .",
    "the work of our school of logic and relativity led by andrka and nmeti is continuation to their research . in a spirit similar to ours",
    ", there is a large variety of works devoted to logical axiomatizations of relativity , see , e.g. , ax  @xcite , benda  @xcite , goldblatt  @xcite , mundy  @xcite , @xcite , pambuccian  @xcite , robb  @xcite , suppes  @xcite , schutz  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our general aims are to axiomatize relativity theories within pure fol using simple , comprehensible and transparent basic assumptions ( axioms ) only ; to prove the surprising predictions ( theorems ) of relativity theories from a minimal number of convincing axioms ; to eliminate tacit assumptions from relativity by replacing them with explicit axioms formulated in fol ( in the spirit of the fol foundation of mathematics and tarski s axiomatization of geometry ) ; and to provide a foundation for relativity theory similar to that of mathematics , cf .",
    "hilbert s 6th problem @xcite . in our perspective axiomatization is only a first step to logical and conceptual analysis where the real fun begins .    for good reasons ,",
    "the foundation of mathematics was performed strictly within fol .",
    "a reason for this fact is that staying within fol helps to avoid tacit assumptions .",
    "another reason is that fol has a complete inference system while second - order logic ( and thus any higher - order logic ) can not have one . for further reasons why to stay within fol",
    "when dealing with axiomatic foundations , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  appendix : why fol ? ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we deal with kinematics , i.e. , with the motion of _ bodies _",
    "( anything which can move , e.g. , test - particles , reference frames , electromagnetic waves or centers of mass ) .",
    "we represent motion as the changing of spatial location in time .",
    "thus we use reference frames for coordinatizing events ( meetings of bodies ) .",
    "_ quantities _ are used for marking time and space .",
    "the structure of quantities is assumed to be an _ ordered field _ in place of the field of real numbers . for simplicity , we associate reference frames with special bodies which we call _",
    "observers_. observations are formulated by means of the _ worldview relation_.    there are several reasons for using observers ( or coordinate systems , or reference frames ) instead of a single observer - independent spacetime structure .",
    "one is that it helps to weed out unnecessary axioms from our theories .",
    "nevertheless , we state and emphasize the logical equivalence of observer - oriented and observer - independent approaches to relativity theory , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "keeping the foregoing in mind , let us now set up the fol language of our axiom systems .",
    "first we fix a natural number @xmath0 for the dimension of spacetime .",
    "we use a two - sorted language : @xmath1 is the sort of ( potential ) * bodies * and @xmath2 is the sort of * quantities*. our language contains the following non - logical symbols : unary relation symbol ( inertial * observers * ) ; binary function symbols , and a binary relation symbol ( the field operations and the ordering on @xmath3 ) ; and a @xmath4-ary relation symbol ( * worldview relation * ) .",

    "body terms are just the variables of sort @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath16 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the so - called atomic formulas of our fol language , where @xmath27 can be arbitrary terms of the required sorts .",
