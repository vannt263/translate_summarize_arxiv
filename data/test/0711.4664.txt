    "elastic materials under external loads may exhibit various responses depending on their geometry , loads , and elastic properties . for large deformations or for inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials as found in biological tissues ,",
    "these responses are best described in the theory of finite deformations @xcite . in hyperelasticity , material properties",
    "are specified by a strain - energy function and there is to date a large literature on the derivation and/or fitting of various forms of strain - energy functions @xcite for rubber - type materials ( referred to as _ elastomers _ ) . the corresponding theory for biological _ soft tissues _ is more recent and is not as well established .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few standard forms of strain - energy functions used to model the elastic responses of soft tissues .",
    "it has long been emphasized by various authors that soft tissues with their dramatic properties under extension behave differently than elastomers and that in many physiological systems ( such as heart , arteries , skin , scalp , etc . )",
    "these properties are tuned to achieve specific mechanical goals vital for normal function and regulation @xcite .",
    "a particularly revealing way to understand the differences between elastomers and soft tissues is to push the material to its extreme by bringing it to a point where a given configuration becomes unstable , and to compare various instabilities for different geometries . here",
    ", we consider three prototype instabilities generated by external loads in an incompressible isotropic elastic body made out of either an elastomer or a biological soft tissue material .    we look in turn at the instabilities generated when a half - space is compressed ( section 3.1 ) , when a spherical membrane shell is inflated ( section 3.2 ) , and when a spherical shell with arbitrary thickness is compressed ( section 3.3 ) . these and other types of instabilities of nonlinear elasticity have been reviewed in an article by gent @xcite where background literature can be found . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "we adopt four different strain energy functions which are popular in literature on elastomers and on soft tissues namely , the mooney - rivlin model , the fung model , the gent model , and the one - term ogden model .",
    "we find that soft tissues behave differently from elastomers when it comes to stability analysis .",
    "for instance half - spaces made of soft tissues are stable in compression , whereas half - spaces made of elastomers always possess a critical stretch beyond which surface instabilities develop .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn for inflation instabilities of spherical membrane shells .",
    "however , thick - walled spherical shells are found more unstable in compression when made of soft tissues than when made of elastomers .",
    "the notion of a material being more or less stable than another one used in this paper is in terms of the critical strains where the material becomes unstable and not in terms of critical stresses or external loads .",
    "the general conclusion is that caution must be exercised when choosing an appropriate model for an elastomer or for a soft tissue , because their behaviours with respect to instabilities are not interchangeable .",
    "the next section recalls the basic underlying equations , see ogden @xcite , for instance .",
    "the deformation of the material body is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe the material coordinates of a point in the reference configuration and in the current configuration , respectively .",
    "let @xmath3 be the deformation gradient .",
    "we consider a hyperelastic incompressible body , so that there exists a strain - energy function @xmath4 such that the _ cauchy stress tensor _ @xmath5 , specifying the stress in the body after deformation , is related to the deformation by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a lagrange multiplier associated with the internal constraint of incompressibility .",
    "the equation for mechanical equilibrium in the absence of body forces is @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the divergence operator in the current configuration .",
    "equation  ( [ equi2 ] ) provides , through the constitutive relationship  ( [ const4 ] ) , a system of three equations for the deformation @xmath10 . the boundary conditions are imposed by prescribing the tractions @xmath11 at the boundary , where @xmath12 is the outward unit vector normal to the boundary .",
    "many different general functional forms have been proposed or derived to model the response of elastic materials under loads @xcite . here , for comparison purposes , we choose some typical functions that have been proposed to model either elastomers or soft tissues .",
    "since we focus on the role of the strain energy functions in instability and not on the role of possible inhomogeneities or anisotropies , we restrict our attention to homogeneous isotropic materials .",
    "we write the energy either in terms of the principal stretches @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( the square roots of the principal values of @xmath16 ) or , equivalently for incompressible solids , in terms of the first two principal invariants of the cauchy - green strain tensors , given by @xmath17    here , we limit our investigation to a few key models that capture specific features and are widely used ( see table 1 ) . the main feature of interest for comparison is the strain - stiffening property exhibited by many biological soft tissues .",
    "this can be modelled either by algebraic power dependence ( one - term ogden model ) , by exponential behaviour ( as in the popular fung model ) , or by limited chain extensibility ( gent model @xcite ) .",
    "we write these three models with a single parameter ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively ) such that the classical neo - hookean model is obtained in the limits @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 .",
    "additionally , we also use the classical mooney - rivlin strain - energy density , often used to model elastomers ; however , experimental values for the material parameter @xmath24 vary widely in the literature and no typical range of values was found .",

    "we focus on two types of instabilities .",
    "one type is related to the notion of limit - point instability , which typically occurs when a balloon is inflated . at first , the balloon is difficult to inflate , and then it may happen that its radius increases dramatically and rapidly , with little or no effort to produce .",
    "here balloons made of elastomers behave completely differently from balloons made of biological soft tissues , as osborne @xcite first observed in 1909 , comparing `` children s toys balloons '' to `` hollow viscera '' ( dog bladders ) .",
    "this instability is investigated in section 3.2 .",
    "the second type of instability considered in this paper is related to the notion of bifurcation .",
    "bifurcation occurs at values of the material and deformation parameters for which there exist solutions to the incremental equations of equilibrium in the neighbourhood of a finite solution . in other words ,",
    "the onset of instability is indicated by the existence of adjacent equilibria under the same loading . to investigate that type of instabilities ,",
    "we consider first a finite deformation @xmath35 and then superimpose an incremental @xcite deformation @xmath36 as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a small parameter .",
    "it follows that the deformation gradient is now @xmath39 where @xmath40 is expressed in the current configuration .",
    "accordingly , we expand the cauchy stress tensor in @xmath38 as @xmath41 say , and the constitutive relationship to obtain to zeroth and first orders , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the fourth - order tensor of _ instantaneous elastic moduli _ , defined by @xmath45 and the derivatives of @xmath46",

    "we now consider different geometries and our four different strain energy functions , to study three prototype instabilities .",
    "the simplest type of bifurcation is obtained by considering an incompressible hyperelastic half - space with a free surface , under pure homogeneous static deformation with principal stretch ratios @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding instability is then assumed to correspond to the appearance of wrinkles on the free surface , once a critical compressive stretch ratio is reached .",
    "let @xmath14 be the stretch ratio in the direction normal to the free surface .",
    "plane pre - strain _ is associated with deformations such that @xmath51 ( axial compression ) , whereas _ equi - biaxial pre - strains _ are obtained for either @xmath52 ( tangential compression ) or for @xmath53 ( normal compression ) .",

    "we start with the classical elastomer modelled by the mooney - rivlin energy @xmath60 from table 1 .",
    "application of the previous criterion in this case leads to a universal condition ( independent of @xmath24 ) @xcite : @xmath61 depending on @xmath62 , we obtain the classical values for the critical compression ratio of instability , for a half - space made of a material with the mooney - rivlin ( or of course , the neo - hookean ) strain energy function .",
    "green and zerna @xcite found @xmath63 under tangential compression ( @xmath64 ) ; biot found @xmath65 under axial compression ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 under normal ( @xmath68 ) compression .",
    "next we turn to the popular fung strain energy for biological soft tissues .",
    "we take @xmath69 in and obtain after simplification the following bifurcation condition : @xmath70 for @xmath71 or @xmath64 , there is a corresponding critical value @xmath72 , or @xmath73 , respectively , after which the bifurcation criterion has no positive real root , see fig .",

    "the present graph provides additional information .",
    "first , it shows that the most unstable mode for thick - walled neo - hookean shells is mode number 10 .",
    "second , the graph makes it clear that at mode 10 , the critical stretch tends to a value which is higher than 0.66614 ( the compressed half - space critical stretch value , see section 3.1 ) as @xmath190 . how is this analysis compatible with the analysis of the neo - hookean half - space ?",
    "we expect that in the limit @xmath191 with @xmath90 constant , the shell should be equivalent to a half - space in tangential bi - axial compression and that we should recover the instability discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "in fact , going from a thick - walled spherical shell to a half - space requires a double limit : not only must the shell become infinitely thick ( and so @xmath190 ) , but also the wavelength of the incremental deformation must be infinitesimally small compared to the thickness and radius of the sphere ( and so @xmath192 ) ; we checked that indeed , @xmath193 in these limits .",
    "this last observation turns out to be crucial to interpret correctly the stability of a compressed fung shell when @xmath194 .",
    "first , the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] show clearly that _ compressed spherical shells made of a fung material are always less stable than shells made of a neo - hookean material_. this trend is further established analytically by determining the exact value for each mode in the limit @xmath195 which is given by the first positive root of @xmath196 the analysis of these roots reveals that for thin shells the critical bifurcation value for each mode @xmath62 increases strictly with @xmath19 . in the limit of thick materials we see that fung shells become unstable at stretch ratios lower than @xmath197 for @xmath198 , @xmath199 for @xmath200 , @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "this result might seem counter - intuitive in light of the analysis conducted in section 3.1 ( see also @xcite ) for surface stability in compression ( a neo - hookean half - space is unstable when @xmath203 and a fung half - space is always stable for @xmath204 . )",
    "however , those lower bounds @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 correspond to low - mode numbers ( @xmath208 3 , 2 , 2 at @xmath209 1 , 5 , 10 , respectively ) , and not to the high - mode numbers limit necessary to reach the half - space idealization .",
    "we further checked that , as @xmath19 increases , higher modes ( say @xmath210 ) can not be excited in the limit @xmath190 .",
    "we also conducted numerical investigations ( not reproduced here ) for the behaviour of shells made of other materials .",
    "the results for the gent and for the one - term ogden strain energy functions are close to those for fung materials that is , a shell made of either a gent or a one - term ogden material is less stable than a thick shell made of a neo - hookean material . again , this is not contradictory with the fact that the gent and ogden half - spaces are more stable than the neo - hookean half - space .",
    "the analysis of the half - space is only relevant for high modes .",
    "finally , we found that a compressed spherical shell made of a mooney - rivlin material is slightly more stable than a compressed spherical shell made of a neo - hookean material ( with the same asymptotic limit  ( [ munh ] ) when @xmath211 . recall that the fung , gent , and mooney - rivlin materials are all stiffer in extension ( strain - hardening effect ) than the neo - hookean material .",
    "one can not help but remark that stability analysis results are difficult to predict in nonlinear elasticity .",
    "for instance it is by now well established that thin - walled spherical shells made of fung materials are extremely stable in inflation .",
    "this has been proved in several contexts by humphrey and his co - workers ( see @xcite and references therein to earlier work ) to refute the hypothesis of an inflation jump instability for the development and rupture of intracranial aneurysms .",
    "it might also be commonly accepted that fung materials are extremely stable in compression , because the half - space stability analysis points clearly in that direction , see section 3.1 .",
    "however we demonstrated here that the opposite conclusion is reached for thick spherical shells in compression . whereas generic strain energy functions may be suitable to describe some properties of materials under loads ,",
    "special care should be taken when trying to describe instabilities in nonlinear elastic materials ."

    "<S> biological soft tissues exhibit elastic properties which can be dramatically different from rubber - type materials ( elastomers ) . to gain a better understanding of the role of constitutive relationships in determining material responses under loads we compare three different types of instabilities ( two in compression , one in extension ) in hyperelasticity for various forms of strain energy functions typically used for elastomers and for soft tissues . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that the strain - hardening property of soft tissues does not always stabilize the material . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the stability analyses for a compressed half - space and for a compressed spherical thick shell can lead to opposite conclusions : a soft tissue material is more stable than an elastomer in the former case and less stable in the latter case . </S>"
