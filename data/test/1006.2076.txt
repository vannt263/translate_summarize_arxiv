    "nano  electromechanical systems ( nems ) are test  beds for the observation of fundamental quantum behaviour of objects which are huge on the scale of individual atoms .",
    "for example , recent experiments @xcite have allowed a detailed study and control of single phonons by cooling a macroscopic resonator mode close to its ground state and coupling it to single electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "one fascinating aspect of nems is their conceptual simplicity that nevertheless can give rise to highly complex physics , and the links that can be established to other fields such as molecular electronics or optomechanics @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges are the details of the oscillator  electron coupling , i.e. in the language of measurement theory to understand , utilize @xcite and control @xcite the ` back ",
    "action ' effects of the detector ( e.g. , superconducting single  electron transistors @xcite ) onto the oscillator .    in many cases , even if no further approximations in simple theoretical models are made , the coupling to external electronic reservoirs that link the detector to the outer world is treated perturbatively , i.e. , in the framework of ( quantum ) master equations .",
    "this has turned out to be a highly successful approach , in particular to describe such various systems as nems coupled to single electron transistors ( sets ) @xcite , franck  condon blockades @xcite in transport through molecules with strong electron  phonon coupling , or quantum shuttles@xcite . from the theory of electronic transport through nanostructures @xcite , however , it is known that such approximations usually are reliable only in the limit of high external voltage bias , where non  markovian effects @xcite due to quantum coherences between the external reservoirs and the electronic system ( set , quantum dot etc . ) can be neglected .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop tools that allow a description of nems beyond the master equation regime ( weak electron  leads coupling ) and at the same time are not merely perturbative in the coupling of the oscillator to the electronic environment @xcite .    in the past",
    ", the coupling of electrons to a single bosonic mode has been solved exactly for the case where only one single electron is present @xcite , i.e. in an empty band approximation .",
    "the inclusion of fermi sea reservoirs at different chemical potential transforms this into a difficult many ",
    "body problem out of equilibrium , and approximations are necessary @xcite .",
    "our approach in this paper is to combine exact solutions of the electronic system with a semi ",
    "classical expansion , together with an adiabatic approximation for the oscillator dynamics within the feynman ",
    "vernon influence functional ( double path integral ) theory @xcite .",
    "we revise this method , which has first been used for simple nems models by mozyrsky and co ",
    "workers @xcite , and extend it to allow for the description of a relatively large class of non  equilibrium electronic environments . the key idea is a systematic expansion around the classical path in order to obtain a langevin equation for the oscillator .",
    "already at the simplest level of this approximation ( neglecting quadratic fluctuations around the diagonal path in the reduced density matrix of the oscillator ) , the coupling to the electronic non  equilibrium environment gives rise to non  trivial effects such as effective oscillator potentials and non  linear friction coefficients leading to both positive and negative damping @xcite .",
    "gaussian fluctuations around the classical path are built into the theoretical description , but they have to be evaluated by numerical solutions of the underlying langevin equations which is not done in this paper .",
    "we compare two non  interacting electronic ` quantum dot ' models with one and two levels between source and drain reservoirs : a single dot , and two dots in series .",
    "the oscillator couples linearly to the dot occupation ( single dot ) or to the occupation difference ( double dot ) . one particular feature of the double dot case ( where quantum superpositions of the electrons become important ) is the occurence of limit cycles in phase space caused by a negative damping .",

    "ii , we present the single dot case in sec .",
    "iii and the double dot case in sec .",
    "detailed derivations of the important formulae can be found in the appendices .",
    "a large class of nems can be described as a composition of an electronic system @xmath0 , a mechanical system @xmath1 and a linear coupling between the two .",

    "whithin this paper the reduced planck constant is set to one ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "our generic model does not include an additional oscillator damping mechanism . in the usual master equation treatment of nems , lindblad - form damping due to external degrees of freedoms is included phenomenologically . in the path integral formalism used here , such degrees of freedom can be easily included at least for linear or weak coupling to the oscillator . in order to elucidate the effect of the electronic environment that we treat in all orders in the coupling to external electronic reservoirs ( contained in @xmath0 ) , we choose not to include additional damping terms in our model here .",
