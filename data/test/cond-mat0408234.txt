    "periodic potentials created by optical lattices are by now recognized as a powerful tool for controlling and manipulating nonlinear matter waves through dynamical diffraction management @xcite .",
    "one of the important implications of such management is creation of nonlinearly localized matter - wave packets , the so - called _ bright atomic solitons _",
    ", in a  bose - einstein condensate with a positive scattering length , i.e. with _ repulsive _ inter - atomic interaction .",
    "such a counter - intuitive effect can occur as wave localization in the gaps of the band - gap spectrum due to the bragg scattering of coherent matter waves by the periodic potential of an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "since the repulsive atomic interactions prohibit a collapse of the bright wavepackets and the solitonic nature of their evolution ensures fixed spatial phase variations due to mean - field effects , the atomic gap solitons may represent an attractive high - density source for atomic interferometry  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of nonlinear localization in a  repulsive bec was established theoretically  @xcite , being recently confirmed experimentally in the case of one - dimensional optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the experimental challenge of the gap soliton generation and manipulation is two - fold .",
    "first , the bec wavepacket , initially loaded into a ground ( bloch ) state of the optical lattice potential , should be accelerated to the edge of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the regime of the wavepacket preparation and the dynamical transition to the band edge dramatically affects the outcome of the experiment  @xcite , and in the best case scenario only weakly localized low - atom - number gap solitons near the bottom edge of the spectral gap can be generated using the current experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "the depth of the gap , where the gap solitons contain large atom numbers and are well localized  @xcite is yet to be accessed .",
    "secondly , the possibility of the gap soliton manipulation , which is essential for interferometric applications , can be limited by impaired mobility of the gap solitons due to effects of lattice discreteness  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the problem of mobility and interactions of gap solitons in a one - dimensional optical lattice without an additional harmonic confinement , within the framework of the continuous gross - pitaevskii model with a periodic potential .",
    "we show that , as the chemical potential of a bec scans the spectral gap , the gap solitons display a variety of scattering properties ranging from those of `` ideal '' solitons without a periodic potential to those of nonlinear localized excitations of discrete nonlinear lattices  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the inelastic collisions of near - the - band - edge gap solitons can provide reliable means for generating highly - localized high - density immobile atomic solitons in the depth of the spectral gap .",
    "we  consider the  dynamics of  a cigar - shape  bec cloud in  the  presence of  a one - dimensional  optical lattice . in dimensionless units",
    "the  gross - pitaevskii ( gp )  equation governing the evolution of the condensate wavefunction can  be  written as : @xmath0 where the  optical lattice potential @xmath1 is  uniform and characterized by  its  depth @xmath2 measured in units of lattice recoil energy @xmath3 , and  lattice period @xmath4 .",
    "the  condensate wave function is  normalized to : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is  the  number of  atoms , @xmath7 , @xmath8  is  the  s - wave scattering length , and @xmath9  the  characteristic harmonic oscillator length in the direction of tight confinement . for  @xmath10rb atoms with @xmath11 kg ,",
    "@xmath12 nm and assuming a transverse frequency @xmath13hz , gives @xmath14 .",
    "the  coefficient @xmath15 characterizes the  type of  the  atomic interactions . in what follows",
    "we consider repulsive interaction , i.e. @xmath16 , and set @xmath17 , which corresponds to @xmath18 @xmath19 lattice spacing .",
    "stationary states of  a  condensate are  described by  solutions of  eq.([gpe1d ] ) of  the  form : @xmath20 , where the   steady - state wave function @xmath21 obeys the  _ time - independent _ gp  equation @xmath22 ) stationary solutions of  equation   are bloch waves , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 have periodicity of the lattice and @xmath25 is the quasi - momentum .",
    "the  linear spectrum @xmath26 of the bloch states has a characteristic band - gap structure , with the lowest two bands shown in  ( a ) in the parameter plane  ( @xmath2 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to  the regions where oscillating solutions of  equation   ( bloch waves ) exist .",
    "the clear areas correspond to the spectral gaps which appear due to the bragg scattering of the matter waves in a periodic structure , being the  forbidden domains for  matter wave propagation .",
    "the gap below the  first band is  the trivial semi - infinite `` total internal reflection '' gap .",
    "the first finite gap is where the formation of  gap solitons in repulsive bec occurs  @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath28 roughly delineates between the regimes of  tight - binding ( @xmath29 ) and superfluid ( @xmath30 ) behavior . in what follows",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of gap solitons in  the  lattice of height @xmath31 which places the first gap into a relatively tight - binding regime .",
    "the nonlinear localization of a  bec with positive scattering length ( @xmath32 ) in the first spectral gap has been well studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the stationary localized solutions of equation   - gap solitons - can be found at any value of @xmath27 inside the spectral gap .",
    "the number of atoms contained in a localized state is small near the lowest gap edge and raises as the chemical potential moves inside the gap  @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order families of  _ on - site _ ( os ) and  _ inter - site _",
    "( is ) gap solitons , centered on the lattice minimum or maximum , respectively , are shown in  ( b ) .",
    "the characteristic `` staggered '' spatial structure of both os and is solitons can be seen in  ( c ) .",
    "in order to study interactions of gap solitons , one has to generate mobile localized states .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the  mobility of  a matter wave soliton in an optical lattice is  restricted by  the existence of the so - called peierls  nabarro ( pn ) potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "the concept of the pn barrier originates from the theory of dislocations and later studies of mobility of localized nonlinear excitations in discrete lattices  @xcite .",
    "the pn barrier is introduced as the height of the effective periodic potential generated by the lattice discreteness , and it defines the minimum energy required to move the centre of mass of a localized wavepacket by one lattice site  @xcite . extending this definition to the continuous lattice model , one can define the pn barrier as the energy difference between the on - site and inter - site localized stationary states  @xcite .",
    "since the os and is states can be mapped to represent a moving mode at different times , the pn barrier can be calculated as the  smallest amount of energy that  a  gap soliton needs to  gain in  order to  start moving along the  lattice . even in the tight - binding regime ,",
    "the amount of the energy needed to initiate the soliton motion is not in agreement with the estimate of the pn barrier height derived from the corresponding discrete nonlinear schrdinger model @xcite , therefore the use of the continuous model in the study of gap soliton motion and interactions is well justified .",
    "a soliton solution of  equation   is  characterized by  its  dynamical invariants : number of  atoms and  energy .",
    "the  soliton energy can be calculated as : @xmath33.\\ ] ] the on - site ( os ) gap soliton is a localized state with the lowest energy , and therefore it is this state that is eventually generated from an arbitrary initial wavepacket . the pn potential height associated with this state",
    "is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the  threshold value of the momentum ( per atom ) that a soliton must have to overcome the barrier is defined as @xmath35 .",
    "such a momentum can be  applied experimentally either by  ultrashort laser pulses or a  tilt of  the  optical lattice potential imposed by a gravitational field or by a slope of a harmonic trap .",
    "the pn potential per atom calculated for  the  family of  os gap solitons within the first gap is shown in  ( a ) .",
    "in contrast , the inter - site state corresponds to a maximum of the pn potential and is _ unstable against small perturbations _ of its center - of - mass position .",
    "such perturbation will lead to conversion of the is soliton into an os soliton , as shown in .",
    "to investigate the dynamics of the os gap soliton with a finite velocity , we solve the evolution equation   numerically .",
    "the initial condition is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a stationary gap soliton wavefunction , and @xmath38 is an  initial momentum per atom .",
    "the values of @xmath38 were chosen below , above , or at  the  threshold value @xmath39 .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in ( b , c , d ) .",
    "due to the large negative group - velocity dispersion  @xcite , solitons near the  edge of the  lower band exhibit _ anomalous steering _ , i.e. initially the direction of motion is opposite to the momentum kick received .",
    "oscillating motion within a  single lattice site has been  observed for  an  initial @xmath38 values below and at  the  threshold [ see  ( b , c ) ] . above the  threshold kinetic energy ( which is still an order of magnitude lower than an individual lattice well depth ) a  soliton undergoes free motion across the lattice , as shown in  ( d ) . during this  motion",
    ", an  atomic soliton evolves through many states centered on  different points of  the  optical lattice . periodic revival of  the states closely resembling  the  stationary states  of the is and os families [ ( c ) ] can be observed , however due to a loss of  atoms neither number of  atoms contained in a  soliton nor @xmath27 are conserved during the evolution . the loss of atoms from the moving localized state increases with  growing @xmath38 .",
    "the  mobility properties of  gap  solitons vary depending on their chemical potential .",
    "close to the lowest gap edge ( @xmath40 in our case ) , gap solitons are well described by the effective nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) for the slowly varying envelope of a bloch state  @xcite . in this regime , solitons are expected to behave like lattice - free envelope solitons of the integrable nls model .",
    "indeed , they exhibit free motion for arbitrary small initial momentum due to  very small energy difference between the  os and is stationary solutions of  equation  .",
    "these states are weakly localized and  contain only about @xmath41  atoms .",
    "deeper in the gap ( @xmath42 ) , the mobility properties of solitons are similar to those of localized solutions of the discrete nls equation , and can be  very well described by  the  concept of  the  pn barrier . in the regime where the solitons are strongly localized in the vicinity of a single lattice well ( @xmath43 ) , their dynamics is dominated by oscillations of the  centre of  mass within a single lattice site for moderate initial perturbations . the soliton motion with a large initial velocity",
    "is accompanied by significant loss of  atoms from the localized structure .",
    "depending on the value of the chemical potential and degree of localization , gap solitons display a  variety of  scattering properties . in particular , we study binary collisions of in - phase solitons numerically for a  range of  values of  the  chemical potentials near the bottom edge of the gap , which is the experimentally accessible region of soliton generation @xcite . we keep the initial separation of soliton centers the same in all cases and chose the same initial velocity above the  pn threshold .",
    "similar interaction conditions can be realized by imposing an additional harmonic confinement onto the system .",
    "three regimes of  soliton collisions have been identified in our simulations .",
    "the first one is  the  regime where in - phase solitons ( @xmath44 ) interact elastically , i.e. without momentum and energy exchange [ see ( a ) ] . in  this  narrow parameter domain ( @xmath45 ) the  dynamics of  the  gap  solitons resembles the  dynamics of `` ideal '' solitons of  the  completely integrable nls equation without the lattice potential .",
    "the total momentum of the system is defined as : @xmath46 and its zero value before and after collision indicates that the soliton collisions are not affected by the lattice periodicity .",
    "deeper in  the  gap the  solitons start to experience stronger localization and their dynamics become inelastic .",
    "significant radiation usually accompanies the collisions , and the  total momentum of the system is no longer conserved .",
    "this is the typical signature of a discrete system  @xcite , and a consequence of nonintegrability introduced by a periodic potential .",
    "the  effect of  small perturbations ( numerical noise which emulates noise in  the  real physical system ) accounts for the  spontaneous symmetry breaking ( sb ) and  generation of finite momentum during the  collision process  @xcite . in  this  `` weakly discrete '' regime of the soliton dynamics",
    ", the solitons can exhibit multiple collisions  @xcite . in  the  multiple collisions solitons",
    "`` bounce '' from each other leading to  either final separation or  fusion , see  ( b , c ) . for @xmath47",
    "the  solitons merge into a  single localized state , as seen in ( d ) , which due to  sb  moves in  an  unpredictable direction across the  lattice and exhibits large amplitude oscillations .",
    "the  appearance of  sb , multiple collisions and  the  total momentum generation has  been  observed for a  range of  the  chemical potential @xmath48 .    for our choice of the optical lattice depth , the solitons relatively close to the lower gap edge ( e.g.  for  @xmath49 ) already exhibit strongly inelastic scattering behavior characteristic of a discrete system . for  the values of the  chemical potential @xmath50",
    "the  binary collisions lead to  fusion of two solitons into a single localized state . unlike the outcome of fusion after multiple collisions , the resulting solitons move with nearly zero velocity and damped amplitude oscillations , as can be seen in .",
    "location of  the  initial states ( containing around 170 atoms each ) on the branches of stationary solutions , is  indicated by  point a in  ( b ) . after collision , an  immobile highly - localized soliton containing a larger number of atoms",
    "is generated . from the @xmath6  vs.  @xmath27 dependence",
    "[ see  ( b ) ] it can be inferred that the  generated soliton , consisting of approximately 270 atoms , lies deeper in the  gap than the  initial states [ see point b in  ( b ) ] .",
    "therefore , inelastic collision of weakly localized near - the - gap - edge solitons can , in principle , be employed for  a  formation of fundamental atomic gap solitons with a larger number of atoms in  the  depth of  the  spectral gap , i.e. in the region of parameters that is currently inaccessible experimentally .",
    "this technique can be useful for any number of colliding solitons near the band edge .",
    "in particular , the case of triple - soliton collisions is illustrated in , were the phase of the central soliton was inverted by @xmath51 to achieve soliton merging .    for solitons located even deeper in the gap",
    ", the binary collisions inevitably result in their fusion , and the emerging localized states remain  confined within a  single lattice well , although their  centre of  mass can oscillate around the  potential minimum .",
    "the amplitude of  the  centre of  mass oscillations increases with  @xmath27 , however the  value of the total momentum averaged over the  time @xmath52 at @xmath53 oscillations : @xmath54 , remains  close to zero .",
    "the values of the post - collision velocity of the localized state ( relative to the initial velocity @xmath55 ) and the average momentum vs. chemical potential of the colliding solitons in the vicinity of the gap edge are plotted in  .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the initial stage of quasi - elastic collisions ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and final stage of the soliton fusion ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) is separated by the symmetry breaking stage , where the outcome of collisions is not predictable .",
    "we note that the symmetry breaking outcome of soliton collisions is also characteristic of binary collisions of solitons with non - zero phase difference , as in the case of a  localized state in the discrete nls model  @xcite .",
    "we have studied numerically both mobilility and interaction of the matter - wave gap solitons in an experimentally accessible regime , i.e. near the lowest edge of the spectral gap of an optical lattice . for the collision velocities above the peierls - nabarro mobility threshold , the gap solitons demonstrate scattering dynamics scenarios ranging from quasi - elastic collisions to soliton fusion . by employing the inelastic collision of two or three gap solitons in configurations that can be realized experimentally , for instance , in a combination of an  optical lattice and a harmonic trap",
    ", we showed that the soliton fusion can be successfully used to generate stationary matter - wave solitons deep in the spectral gap . applying the  same technique to  solitons with different amplitudes can  potentially enable generation and  steering of  a  mobile high - density soliton .",
    "such a  process of gap - soliton manipulation may eventually lead to new possibilities for the preparation of sources for atomic interferometry @xcite .",
    "this work was partially supported by the australian research council ( arc ) .",
    "the australian centre for quantum - atom optics is an arc centre of excellence ."
