    "the growth of crystal phases from the melt occurs in many material processing applications such as zone refinement and epitaxial growth . in the early 20th century , a classical theory by wilson for the growth of crystals rate from viscuous melt is proposed based on the picture of abrupt interface separating semi - infinite melt and crystal@xcite .",
    "it assumes that the particles in the liquid phase diffuse over a distance approximately of the order of the particle size before impinging on and later being absorbed by the lattice . comparing to experiments on crystal growth from viscous melts ,",
    "this theory shows good agreements in terms of the crystal growth rate@xcite .",
    "however , recent studies on crystal - melt interface of organic crystals@xcite , simple metals@xcite , and lennard - jones crystals@xcite have provided more insights into the growth kinetics and morphology of materials .",
    "in contrast to the growth from viscous melts , which consists of large complex molecules , the above - mentioned crystal - melt interface grows at a much higher rate than that predicted by the classical theory@xcite .",
    "mikheev and chernov@xcite first offered an analytic treatment of this interface growth kinetic by taking proper account of the crystal ordering at the crystal - melt surface .",
    "they propose that as the crystal grows the ordering of atoms occurs simultaneously in many surface layers instead of solely on a sharp crystal - melt interface . with this notion",
    ", they derive an analytical expression for kinetic coefficient , which is the proportionality constant between the crystal - melt interface velocity and the interface undercooling , in terms of bulk physical quantities such as relaxation time , structure factor , latent heat of fushion and melting temperature .    in the past few decades",
    ", several microscopic theories have been proposed to show that anisotropy of the excess interface energy is a crucial parameter that determines morphology of dendrites during solidification .",
    "ginzburg - landau ( gl)theory with order parameter representing amplitude of density waves has been used to calculate the magnitude of interfacial free energy @xmath1 in different systems and also for different crystal structure like fcc and diamond cubic@xcite .",
    "gl theory is shown to successfully capture capillary anisotropy of crystal - melt interfaces by incorporating underlying crystal symmetries . in this paper",
    ", we derive interfacial kinetics using gl theory from a different yet more compact perspective .",
    "firstly we outline the hydrodynamic approach adopted by mikheev and chernov@xcite in deriving the kinetic coefficient .",
    "then we extend ginzburg - landau theory to describe a moving interface of solid - liquid systems under a given undercooling . based on our previous work on crystalline anisotropy for bcc - liquid interface",
    ", we explicitly computed the kinetic coefficients using the equilibrium density wave profiles , which is contrasted with that obtained through the approximation scheme proposed previously@xcite .",
    "finally , comparisons to molecular dynamics(md ) simulation and the physical origin of kinetic anisotropy are discussed .    _",
    "outlines of the hydrodynamic approach _ : to understand the kinetics of the non - equilibrium solid - liquid interfaces of a given undercooling , it is instructive to consider the number density current @xmath2 ( i.e. number of particles flowing across an unit area in a given direction per unit time ) as well as the quadratic isothermal dissipative function@xcite constructed accordingly : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( generally nonlocal and density dependent ) dissipated kernel . the dissipated function @xmath5 represents the amount of ( free ) energy dissipated per unit time . assuming that the heat transfer at the relevant length scale is much faster than the structure rearrangement under consideration@xcite ,",
    "the generalized hydrodynamic equations are@xcite :      note that @xmath7 $ ] refers to the free energy for the ( inhomogeneous ) equilibrium fluid _ _ minus its kinetic energy contribution__@xcite , which is different from the free energy in the gl theory used later .    for small undercoolings ,",
    "the density profile for the solid - liquid interface can be described by the contant velocity wave of the form@xcite : @xmath8 where the sum is taken over principal reciprocal lattice vectors of the crystal .",
    "note that we align the interface normal in @xmath9 , and denote the steady - state velocity as @xmath10 . by solving eqs .",
    "one immediately gets the free energy balance relation between dissipation and crystallization@xcite : @xmath11 with the dissipated kernel given by @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 represents the density of liquid , @xmath14 the melting temperature , and @xmath15 the undercooling with reference to the melt . note that the dissipated kernel is related to the relaxation time @xmath16 measured as",
    "the inverse half - width of the dynamical structure factor @xmath17 at given @xmath18@xcite .",
    "inserting the longitudinal part of the traveling density wave eq . into the energy balance equation eq .",
    "one arrives at the expression for interface velocity : @xmath19^{-1}\\ ] ] as will be shown latter , eq .",
    "can be derived from the gl theory by including a linear temperature dependence .",
    "_ extension of ginzburg - landau theory _ : different from the ginzburg - landau theory for the solid - liquid interface at equilibrium developed by shih _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and wu _ _ et al.__@xcite , we extend the discussion to a solid - liquid system that is out of equilibrium where the system is undercooled and the solid - liquid interface moves at a constant velocity . near the melting point @xmath14 ,",
    "the free energy difference between solid and liquid phase is related to latent heat of fusion @xmath20 , @xmath21 where we have used the thermodynamic relation @xmath22 .",
    "since we are to deal with the dynamics close to the melting temperature , we should incorporate a term linear in @xmath23 ( i.e. the amplitude of density waves corresponding to a specific principal lattice vector of the reciprocal lattice of the solid ) with the equilibrium free energy so as to recover eq , .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the excess free energy for the solid - liquid system in equilibrium , which , under the assumption that the density wave amplitude varies slowly over a scale @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the wave vector at which the peak of structure factor is located , takes the form@xcite : @xmath28 note that @xmath29 refers to the fourier transform of the direct correlation function @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath13 is the atomic density in the liquid phase , and @xmath32 is the equilibrium amplitude of the principal reciprocal lattice vectors in the solid which corresponds to one minimum of @xmath33 .",
    "one can check that this is point where @xmath34 .",
    "note that for convenience in subsequent comparisons we include a normalization factor @xmath35 to account for the slope of the linear tilt potential of the bcc - liquid interface@xcite .",
    "as usual , one can obtain the kinetic coefficient @xmath36 by looking for the steady - state propagating solutions of the following equation of motion(assuming the interface normal @xmath37 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the relaxation time measured as the inverse half - width of the dynamic structure factor@xcite . an analytic expression for @xmath10 and hence @xmath0 , the kinetic coefficient ,",
    "can be obtained by using a solvability condition as outlined in all phase - field review papers@xcite , which relates @xmath10 and @xmath40 . for anisotropic cases ,",
    "the interface profiles for different sets of density wave amplitudes are coupled but @xmath0 can still be computed analytically from a similar solvability condition whose procedure is shown below .",
    "our previous work on crystalline anisotropy for bcc - liquid interfaces@xcite shows that the amplitudes of density waves can be categorized into different groups according to the value of square gradient term appeared in the gl free energy functional(summarized in table.i ) .",
    "for this reason , we arbitrarily choose the @xmath41 crystal face along which the amplitude of propagating density waves are denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 to examplify our calculation .        to obtain a steady - state solution of propagating wave with velocity @xmath10 along the interface normal @xmath9 , we cast eq . into the moving frame and expand the density wave amplitude around the melting point .",
    "after using the stationarity of the equilibrium density and simplifying , one arrives at the following matrix equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 here we denote @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the equilibrium density wave amplitudes specific to the @xmath41 interface .",
    "note that @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "employing again the stationariy of equilibrium density profile , we have @xmath55 with @xmath56 . combining this with eq .",
    "one arrives at      setting the boundary conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the density wave velocity @xmath10 can be further simplified into ( here the subscript of v indicates the crystal face normal @xmath41 specific to this case ) @xmath60^{-1}\\ ] ] we can also apply the same analysis to different crystal faces with references to different sets of density wave amplitudes and square gradients listed in table .",
    "i. in any case , we can re - write the kinetic coefficient ( @xmath0 ) in a more compact form by noting that @xmath61 and @xmath62 : @xmath63^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{l}{k_bt^2_m}\\frac{s(\\vec{k}_i)}{\\tau(\\vec{k}_i)}\\left[\\int dz\\sum_{\\vec{k}_i}\\left(\\frac{d u_i}{dz}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , this is the same as that derived by mikheev _ etal",
    "_ @xcite ( see eq . ) .",
    "we plotted the dependence of velocity @xmath10 with reference to different crystal faces on the dimensionless undercooling @xmath64 explicitly in fig.[comp ] and contrasted the numerical value of @xmath0 obtained here with that in mc theory in table ii .",
    "although both theories predict similar kinetic anisotropy ordering@xcite , @xmath65 , we would like to emphasize that mc theory ( i.e. the second row in table ii ) computed the kinetic coefficient with @xmath66 estimated from a linear theory , which is different from the exact profiles we used here(i.e . the first column in the same table ) .",
    "the good agreement of our calculation with both md and mc theory reveals that by taking into consideration the anisotropy of crystalline orientations the broken symmetry of interfacial kinetics is automatic regardless of ( i)the details of atomistic dynamics within or outside of the interface as well as ( ii ) the hydrodynamcal properties of the melt .",
    "_ conclusions _ : we have computed the kinetic coefficient @xmath0 , which is the proportionality constant between interface velocity and undercooling , by incorporating a temperature dependence term into the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional . though different from the mikheev - chernov ( mc)@xcite theory based on the hydrodynamic equations of conservation of momentum and particle number , our intuitive and more compact extenstion of ginzburg - landau calculation predicts the same ordering for kinetic coefficients in different crystal faces . in addition , we have contrasted both theories with md simulations and find good accuracy .",
    "this reveals that not only is our method quantitatively precise in dealing with non - equilibrium interfacial kinetics problems but also provides a explanation to the anisotropy of interfacial kinetics  the broken symmetry at the interface for various crystalline orientations ."
