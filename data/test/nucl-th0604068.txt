    "recently , there has been a wide interest in relativistic potentials involving mixtures of vector and scalar potentials with opposite signs .",
    "the interest lies on attempts to explain the pseudospin symmetry in nuclear physics .",
    "@xcite , using a dirac hamiltonian with scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath2 potentials quadratic in space coordinates , found a harmonic - oscillator - like second order equation which can be solved analytically for @xmath3 , as considered before by kukulin _",
    "@xcite , and also for @xmath4 .",
    "very recently , ginocchio solved the triaxial , axial , and spherical harmonic oscillators for the case @xmath5 and applied it to the study of antinucleons embedded in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath6 is particularly relevant in nuclear physics , since it is usually pointed out as a necessary condition for occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in nuclei @xcite-@xcite . also the observed isospin dependence of pseudospin",
    "can be explained by the effect of the @xmath7 potential on the shape of the @xmath8 potential @xcite-@xcite . as shown by bell and ruegg @xcite",
    ", the @xmath9 and @xmath6 cases correspond to a @xmath10 symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian with only scalar and vector potentials which is independent of the particular shapes of these potentials .    a generalized harmonic oscillator ( ho ) for spin 1/2 particles that includes not only those combinations of scalar and vector potentials , but also a linear tensor potential , giving rise to the so - called dirac oscillator , has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "the research of this kind of interaction was started by it @xcite and has been revived by moshinsky and szczepaniak @xcite ( see @xcite for a complete reference list ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a special attention was paid to the case when the scalar and vector potentials are such that @xmath11 , which , as stated before , has been related to the nuclear pseudospin symmetry .",
    "there it has been concluded that only when the tensor potential is turned on one gets negative energy bound - state solutions along with the usual positive energy solutions .",
    "those negative energy solutions are important to describe the possible existence of antinucleons in nuclei @xcite . when the tensor potential is absent the special conditions relating the scalar and vector potentials ( @xmath12 ) are needed to have a standard positive ho potential which is only able to bind fermions , and therefore exclude the negative bound - state solutions from the spectra",
    "actually , as was discussed in another context in @xcite , with an appropriate choice of signs , potentials fulfilling the relations @xmath12 are able to bind either fermions or antifermions . as an example",
    ", we will see later that a ( negative ) harmonic potential , with no tensor potential , binds antifermions and does not allow positive bound - state solutions .",
    "closely related to this is the fact that , in the nucleus , the charge - conjugation transformation relates the spin symmetry of the negative bound - state solutions ( antinucleons ) to the pseudospin symmetry of the positive bound - state solutions ( nucleons ) @xcite .",
    "this has also been discussed recently in @xcite , analyzing the ho for antinucleons with spin symmetry ( @xmath5 ) and without the tensor interaction .",
    "again , the charge conjugation connects this problem with the ho for nucleons with pseudospin symmetry ( @xmath13 ) , but in this case the positive harmonic binding potential is @xmath14 .",
    "note that , because the harmonic potential does not vanish for large distances but is a confining potential , it is possible to obtain particle bound - state solutions in the exact pseudospin limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that this connection between spin and pseudospin symmetry obtained by charge conjugation deserves to be more explored . in addition , after the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed as a relativistic symmetry by ginocchio @xcite , a link of it to chiral symmetry has been suggested based on sum rules calculations in relativistic chiral models that support a small value for @xmath8 @xcite . however , until now , a clear connection of pseudospin and chiral symmetries has not been established .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to shed some light in the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 chiral transformations . in order to do so",
    ", we solve the mixed scalar - vector - pseudoscalar ho potential in 1 + 1 dimensions , taking advantage of the simplicity of the lowest dimensionality of the space - time .",
    "this approach is equivalent to consider fermions in 3 + 1 dimensions which are restricted to move in one direction @xcite .",
    "we explore the spectra when it is possible to obtain analytical solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the particular cases when @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as referred before , if the pseudocalar term is turned off , these cases correspond , respectively , to have exact spin and pseudospin symmetry in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we explore all the possible signs of the quadratic ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) and linear ( pseudoscalar ) potentials , thus paying attention to bound states of fermions and antifermions as well .",
    "we compare both cases @xmath9 and @xmath6 to establish the charge - conjugation connection discussed above in the presence of the pseudoscalar term .",
    "we also consider the case of zero mass to look for the connection between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of the chiral transformation .",
    "an added motivation for this paper is given by the recent demonstration that the relativistic 3 + 1 ho with scalar and vector potentials can describe successfully the heavy nucleus spectrum @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the ho are determined by fitting the scalar and vector potentials derived from relativistic mean field nuclear calculations ( rmf ) .",
    "the @xmath17pb neutron single - particle levels obtained in the ho are very similar to the rmf results .",
    "the pseudospin symmetry is shown to be almost satisfied for a heavy nucleus in the ho description .",
    "the possibility of breaking perturbatively this symmetry in the 3 + 1 ho by a tensor interaction ( in our 1 + 1 case a pseudoscalar coupling ) has been discussed in @xcite and can be included in a calculation like the one of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to improve the results .",
    "thus , the study of all the possible eigenenergies of the 1 + 1 ho , presented in this paper , considering not only the positive energy solutions already obtained for the 3 + 1 case in @xcite but also the negative ones , can be applied to analyze the existence of antinucleons in nuclei and their spectrum .",
    "the particle and antiparticle spectra we obtain for the cases @xmath6 and @xmath9 demonstrate the charge - conjugation connection referred above .",
    "they also show that the spectra of massless @xmath5 states are degenerate with massless @xmath11 states . further imposing chiral symmetry to these states , such that they would become eigenstates of @xmath0 ,",
    "would imply that all potentials would be zero and thus one would have just massless free fermions .",
    "our conclusions are valid in the case of 3 + 1 dimensions , because , as will be shown later , one basically has to add the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 to the coefficients of the functions appearing in the 1 + 1 eigenvalue equations in order to get the corresponding 3 + 1 equations .",

    "there we also present the eigenvalue equation and the wave functions for bound states , discuss the dirac oscillator case ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and show how one can use the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations to get the eigenenergies for the @xmath6 case from the @xmath9 case .",

    "the two - dimensional dirac equation can be obtained from the four - dimensional one with the mixture of spherically symmetric scalar , vector and anomalous magnetic - like ( tensor ) interactions . if we limit the fermion motion to the @xmath27-direction ( @xmath28 ) the four - dimensional dirac equation decomposes into two equivalent two - dimensional equations with 2-component spinors and 2@xmath292 matrices @xcite",
    ". then , there results that the scalar and vector interactions preserve their lorentz structures whereas the anomalous magnetic - like interaction turns out to be a pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "furthermore , in the 1 + 1 world there is no angular momentum so that the spin is absent .",
    "therefore , the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation allows us to explore the physical consequences of the negative - energy states in a mathematically simpler and more physically transparent way . in this spirit",
    "the two - dimensional version of the anomalous magnetic - like interaction linear in the space coordinate has also received attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "later this system was shown to be a particular case of a more general class of exactly solvable problems asc2 .",
    "let us begin by presenting the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the dirac equation for a particle with mass @xmath30 and a general potential @xmath31 , to be defined later , is formally the same as its 3 + 1 counterpart : @xmath32here @xmath33 and the @xmath34 matrices @xmath35 obey the usual relations @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the @xmath34 identity matrix .",
    "the metric tensor and the covariant derivative operator are , respectively , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined in the usual way , such that eq .",
    "( eq_dirac_gen ) is written as @xmath40where @xmath41 .",
    "the positive definite function @xmath42 , satisfying a continuity equation , is interpreted as a position probability density and its norm is a constant of motion .",
    "this interpretation is completely satisfactory for single - particle states @xcite .",
    "the traceless matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and obey the relations @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "we set @xmath31 to be @xmath49where @xmath50 .",
    "this is the most general combination of lorentz structures because there are only four linearly independent 2@xmath292 matrices .",
    "the subscripts for the terms of the potential denote their properties under a lorentz transformation : @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the time and space components of the 2-vector potential , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the scalar and pseudoscalar terms , respectively .",
    "if the terms in the potential @xmath31 are time - independent , the dirac equation ( [ def_hamiltoniano_d ] ) becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the fermion energy . to have an explicit expression for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 matrices one can choose 2@xmath292 pauli matrices which satisfy the same algebra .",
    "we use @xmath60 , @xmath61 and thus @xmath62 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ time_ind_h ] ) is invariant under the parity operation , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 change sign , whereas @xmath66 and @xmath67 remain the same .",
    "this is because the parity operator is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a constant phase and @xmath70 changes @xmath27 into @xmath71 . since this unitary operator anticommutes with @xmath58 and @xmath72 , they change sign under a parity transformation , whereas @xmath37 and @xmath59 , which commute with @xmath73 , remain the same .",
    "when one writes down the explicit equations of motion in terms of the components of the spinor @xmath74 , the combinations @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the vector and scalar components arise naturally . therefore , it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ time_ind_h ] ) in terms of these potentials .",
    "we have @xmath77      the charge - conjugation operation changes the sign of the electromagnetic interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ , changes the sign of the time and space potentials in ( [ def_v ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by the transformation ( see , for example , itzykson and zuber @xcite ) @xmath78where @xmath79 denotes matrix transposition and @xmath80 is a matrix such that @xmath81 . in @xmath82 dimensions one matrix that satisfies",
    "this relation is @xmath83if we choose the phase factor @xmath84 equal to 1 , we have @xmath85after applying this charge - conjugation operation to the dirac equation ( def_hamiltoniano_d ) , the time - independent dirac equation becomes @xmath86where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 in terms of the potentials @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 , this hamiltonian reads @xmath90one sees that the charge - conjugation operation changes the sign of the energy and of the potentials @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in turn , this means that @xmath16 turns into @xmath94 and @xmath15 into @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , to be invariant under charge conjugation , the hamiltonian must contain only a scalar potential .",
    "the chiral operator for a dirac spinor is the matrix @xmath0 , and we will call `` chiral transformation '' the transformation associated with it .",
    "thus , the transformed spinor is given by @xmath96 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 anticommutes with @xmath59 , the time - independent chiral - transformed dirac equation is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 or @xmath102 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the chiral transformation changes the sign of the mass and of the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials , thus turning @xmath8 into @xmath14 and vice - versa .",
    "a chiral - invariant hamiltonian needs to have zero mass and @xmath103 and @xmath22 zero everywhere .",
    "the space component of the 2-vector potential in ( [ def_v ] ) can be absorbed into the wave function by defining a new spinor @xmath104 such that @xmath105 in which @xmath106 , since we have @xmath107 . from this point on",

    "the fact that in a dirac equation one can have lorentz scalar and pseudoscalar potentials leads to remarkable results that are at odds with what is known from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , where the lorentz structure plays no role , since one has only potentials which couple to the energy , _",

    "it has already been verified that a constant added to the pseudoscalar screened coulomb potential @xcite or to the pseudoscalar inversely linear potential asc100 is physically relevant and plays a crucial role in ensuring the existence of bound states . as an example of another notable result",
    ", it is well known that a confining potential for a nonrelativistic fermion can not confine it in the relativistic regime when the potential is considered as a lorentz vector ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , simply because there is pair creation and the single - particle picture does not hold anymore . it is surprising that the converse is also true , _ i.e. _ , that relativistic binding potentials may not bind in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this is the case of @xmath164 ( @xmath11 ) referred before , and is basically due to the fact that vector potentials couple in a different way than scalar potentials in the dirac equation , whereas there is no such distinction in the schrdinger equation . actually , as we have seen before , @xmath8 , which is the sum of a vector and a scalar potential , plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit , whereas a weak enough @xmath14 can not bind a fermion with nonrelativistic energy if @xmath6 .",

    "this objection is overcome when we deal with ultrarelativistic particles , for which we may consider @xmath401 . in this case",
    ", the chiral transformation relates massless physical states with @xmath402 and a pseudoscalar potential @xmath22 to massless states with @xmath403 and @xmath404 , where @xmath405 can be an arbitrary potential . for harmonic oscillator potentials , one has @xmath406 and @xmath388 .",
    "since , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : rel_h_oscillator ] , the chiral transformation does not change the equations of motion , the energy of their solutions is not changed .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , where are plotted , respectively , the solutions of the @xmath9 and @xmath407 eigenvalue equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) and ( eigen_eq_sigma=0 ) , when @xmath251 , for @xmath408 and several @xmath26 values .",
    "the basic features of these plots were already discussed in the previous section .",
    "as before , the @xmath383 isolated solution was excluded .     as a function of @xmath253 for @xmath9 and @xmath251 .",
    "the conventions are the same as in fig .",

    "the conventions are the same as in fig .",
    "the dashed parabola represents the function @xmath409.,width=377 ]    we see that the spectra are the same apart from the @xmath388 change , which shows up as a reversal of the horizontal axis . for @xmath274 , the pure harmonic oscillator solution , both spectra are _ identical",
    "_ , with no negative - energy solutions and , of course , no nonrelativistic limit .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath9 and @xmath6 energy eigenstates _ are not the same _ , since @xmath0 interchanges the upper and lower components .",
    "this amounts to say that these states are not eigenstates of @xmath0 , which of course they could not be , since , because of @xmath1 , it does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_d_sigma_delta ] ) even with @xmath410 and @xmath161 . if @xmath103 would be zero , then , because one has either @xmath411 or @xmath6 , @xmath412 would have also to be zero , and we would have a free ultrarelativistic particle , which has a good chirality , _",
    "i.e. _ , is an eigenstate of @xmath0 .",
    "in this work we studied the solutions of 1 + 1 dirac equation with a potential with the most general lorentz structure which leads to harmonic oscillator potentials in the second - order differential equation for the spinor components .",
    "this is achieved when the vector @xmath412 and scalar @xmath103 potentials are quadratic and satisfy either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and the pseudoscalar potential is linear .",
    "we showed that there are no bound - state solutions in the nonrelativistic limit for @xmath11 and @xmath22 very small , meaning in this case we have an intrinsic relativistic problem .",
    "we analyzed in great detail , by use of a graphical procedure , the solutions of the transcendental eigenvalue equation in the case of @xmath9 , for all signs of the potentials and for both particle and antiparticle states .",
    "as referred in the introduction , there is an increasing interest in studying the behavior of antinucleon in nuclei , and in particular how well pseudospin and spin symmetries hold for nucleons and antinucleons respectively .",
    "we discussed in detail the isolated solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ , solutions out of the sturm - liouville problem , as well as the critical points in the parameter space of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the coefficients of the quadratic and linear potentials . near these points",
    "there is a high density of bounded states which are very extended in space .",
    "these critical points are also relevant to determine which values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 allow to have a spectrum of both fermion and antifermion bounded solutions simultaneously or just one of these kind of solutions .",
    "we established a connection to 3 + 1 dimensional relativistic oscillator harmonic potentials applied to nuclei , where there is a relation between those coefficients and concluded that , for a sufficiently strong @xmath14 potential , both kinds of solutions ( _ i.e _ , for both nucleons and antinucleons ) can coexist .",
    "we showed how to obtain the solutions for @xmath6 from the @xmath9 case , using the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations .",
    "in particular , we used the chiral transformation to show that , for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , the @xmath5 and @xmath11 solutions have the same spectrum .",
    "these conclusions are quite general and do not depend on the number of dimensions so that they remain true in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "also , most of the features of the 1 + 1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3 + 1 relativistic harmonic oscillator . indeed , since the 1 + 1 eigenvalue equations for @xmath9 and @xmath6 are very similar to the corresponding 3 + 1 equations , we can apply the same graphical methods to the 3 + 1 case , and therefore most of the analysis of the 1 + 1 case remains true with appropriate changes .",
    "for instance , the shape of the parabola in the energy-@xmath26 plane related to @xmath413 would depend now on the value of the spin - orbit quantum number @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath268 would also depend on @xmath19 , and therefore the roots @xmath302 and critical value @xmath414 would also depend on @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath274 there would be the known harmonic oscillator @xmath415 degeneracy , produced by the u(3 ) symmetry studied very recently by ginocchio @xcite in connection to spin and isospin symmetry .",
    "finally , the chiral transformation enables us to switch between the so - called pseudospin ( @xmath6 and @xmath161 ) and spin symmetries ( @xmath5 and @xmath161 ) @xcite _ for any potential_. in the context of a study of the symmetries of a 3-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator , ginocchio already showed that one can transform the generators of the su(2 ) spin symmetry into the pseudospin generators by a @xmath0 transformation @xcite .",
    "we showed that this transformation allows us to relate the @xmath402 and @xmath403 problems for any potential @xmath405 , and , for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , also to conclude that the two energy spectra are the same ."
