    "the low energy processes with a hadron participation are permanently in the center of theoretical and experimental activity . new measurements and more precise experimental data force us to look for new theoretical approaches .",
    "there are two known and widely used methods of effective lagrangian s approach in hadron physics : the effective lagrangian deriving from the qcd principles immediately @xcite-@xcite , and the use of various dynamical symmetries to build the basic lagrangian in a phenomenological way @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the linear sigma - model @xmath1 is the most popular and examined part of the second way .",
    "it is the main approach to the effective analysis of nucleon - nucleon @xcite-@xcite and quark - meson interaction @xcite together with the vector dominance model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an exact theory of the meson interactions should be nonperturbative .",
    "that is why a lot of hadron characteristics ( effective couplings , formfactors etc . )",
    "are calculated , in particular , in the qcd sum rules method operating with some nonperturbative vacuum parameters . and",
    "that is precisely why we need in effective meson interaction theory giving an information on the low - energy effects and hadron structure .    an effective model of @xmath2",
    "chiral interactions can be deduced from the fundamental qcd @xcite , using the bosonization procedure .",
    "in such a way , the gauge structure of meson interactions follows from the quark level qft @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial quarks with current masses transform to the constituent ones with effective masses @xmath3 , including some contribution of the internal gluon substructure .",
    "therewith , quark loops simulate an uprising of nonperturbative model parameter .",
    "so , the proportionality of pion mass to the `` quark condensate '' is restored in the framework of such effective models  @xcite .",
    "further , to incorporate electromagnetic and strong ( vectorlike ) interactions into the effective theory an appropriate vector fields are introduced as the gauge fields .",
    "the vector meson treatment as the gauge fields realizing some dynamical symmetry , is useful to diminish some theoretical uncertainty of phenomenological description of the hadron interactions . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the gauge models were successfully used for the consideration of some low - energy aspects of baryon - meson interaction .",
    "it means that the fundamental quantum field principles can be applied to the describing of interaction at the different hierarchical levels . in the case under consideration",
    ", it provides a transition from the quark - level sigma model ( @xmath4 ) to the nucleon - level sigma model ( @xmath5 ) .    to construct an effective meson interaction model",
    ", we will use the gauge scheme based on @xmath0 group .",
    "this group is the simplest one to consider the light unflavored vector mesons , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , together with the photon , as the gauge fields .",
    "moreover , it has the necessary symmetry to describe the electromagnetic and strong meson - meson and quark - meson interactions , which are insensitive to the chiral structure .",
    "so , to analyze the electromagnetic and strong effects only , it is sufficient to localize the diagonal sum of the global chiral @xmath8 .",
    "this sum corresponds to @xmath9 subgroup of the total gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "the extra @xmath10 groups are introduced for the gauge realization of the vector meson dominance ( see the next section ) .",
    "note that in the model we deal with the constituent quarks not with the fundamental current ones .",
    "obviously , the electromagnetic interaction violates the isospin symmetry .",
    "after the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry , higgs fields can be associated with the scalar mesons @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see the next section ) .    as it was noted above",
    ", this model reproduces the relation @xmath13 , if the quark condensate is taken into account in the equation for the vacuum shift .",
    "further , quarks arise in the model as the gauge group representations , and these degrees of freedom account for the internal meson structure .",
    "in fact , quark - meson models ( see also @xcite ) are necessary hybrid approaches to reproduce both nonperturbative and structure effects of the low - energy meson interactions .    in this paper ,",
    "the gauge scheme interactions of @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath14 with quarks and mesons are analyzed .",
    "in particular , this scheme describes some important features of radiative decays of vector mesons .",
    "namely , the electromagnetic quanta mixing with @xmath7- and @xmath6- fields leads to the gauge variant of vector dominance , i.e. all these interactions are considered in the same way .",
    "so , we deal with the @xmath15 which incorporates gauge interactions of vector mesons with the constituent quarks",
    ". then , the model accounts for hadronic internal degrees of freedom , which are described in the quantum field approach .",
    "really , two - level ( quark - meson ) structure of the model realizes some analog of the `` bootstrap '' idea .",
    "the model contains a number of free parameters in the gauge sector , which can be fixed from the well measured two - particle decays of vector mesons .",
    "as it will be shown later , the gauge model predictions for the radiative vector meson decays are strict ( without any free parameters ) .    as a rule",
    ", the radiative decays @xmath16 and @xmath17 were described in a phenomenological way . within the framework of the gauge model ,",
    "these processes arise at the tree level .",
    "there is a good agreement between the theory and the experimental data on the vector meson radiative decays .",
    "so , these decays can be successfully studied in the gauge field approach .",
    "internal meson structure is described by the quark - meson sector of the model .",
    "these aspects of the model have been tested in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays and results of calculations are in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "analysis of the decay @xmath21 @xcite , which arises at the loop level due to the quark - meson interaction only , is more cumbersome .",
    "calculations done show that the three - pion decays of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons are well descripted in this model .",
    "the obtained results are in preparation now .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 the gauge field model",
    "is described .",
    "numerical results for tree decays @xmath24 and @xmath25 are presented in section 3 .",
    "we consider loop decays @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath20 in section 4 .",
    "the gauge model of the low - energy meson interactions is based on the conceptual assumption concerning the transfer of gauge principles from the fundamental quark level to the effective hadron one .",
    "just the same transfer was deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of quark - meson hierarchy levels .",
    "the applicability of the gauge approach to the baryon - meson interaction was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show the validity of the gauge scheme for the case of meson - meson and quark - meson effective interactions .",
    "we describe @xmath7- and @xmath6- mesons together with @xmath14- field within the framework of the gauge approach .",
    "thus , the strong and electromagnetic interactions are united in the gauge scheme .",
    "the simplest variant of corresponding dynamical symmetry is based on @xmath28 group .",
    "as it must be , the global symmetry of the chiral model takes place here , and , in a general case , the total chiral group of symmetry should be localized .",
    "however , for the application of the gauge approach to the @xmath23 and @xmath22 strong and electromagnetic decays , it is reasonably to localize the diagonal sum of @xmath29 subgroups together with the additional @xmath10 groups .",
    "the traditional @xmath30- model is a part of the model involving nonlinear terms of self - action .",
    "the @xmath30-model symmetry can be realized in various representations of the global groups : @xmath31 , where @xmath9 means the diagonal sum of @xmath29 subgroups .",
    "for all these cases we have six independent parameters of transformations .",
    "transformation of the quark doublet is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the parameters of the @xmath34 group and @xmath35 are the parameters of the @xmath36 group .",
    "thus , here we use @xmath37 representation for @xmath38 and @xmath30 fields .",
    "then , the corresponding transformation properties fo @xmath39 are : @xmath40    having two sets of independent parameters @xmath41 and @xmath35 , to describe strong and electromagnetic interactions it is sufficient to localize the @xmath41 set together with the parameters of @xmath10 groups .",
    "( to consider weak interactions the localization of the @xmath35 parameters should be added . ) as it is seen , the triplet of pions is the adjoined representation of the gauge group . at the same time , the quark doublet @xmath42 is the fundamental representation of this group .",
    "thus , we consider the triplet @xmath43 , the singlet @xmath30-meson and @xmath44-quarks as fields of matter .    the physical scalar fields , emerging from the initial higgs multiplets ,",
    "can be associated with the scalar mesons @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    from these considerations",
    "the model lagrangian is : @xmath45 here @xmath46 - is the first generation quark doublet ; @xmath47 - two scalar fields doublets with hypercharges @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the gauge derivatives and field strengthes are : @xmath51 in principle , the gauge invariant term @xmath52 can be added to the lagrangian .",
    "however , this term can be diagonalized from the very beginning by the orthogonal transformation of the initial @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields .",
    "so , we get the same lagrangian with the redefined @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields .    to describe the realistic processes of decays and scattering we introduce also the interactions of leptons with @xmath55 and @xmath10 fields in the gauge form : @xmath56 where interaction of @xmath54 field with leptons is driven by the phenomenological coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "note that the origin of the last term in the above formula is specific .",
    "namely , this term is caused by the nondiagonal @xmath52 part of the initial lagrangian .",
    "thus , the interaction of leptons with the @xmath54 vector field occurs allowing to describe the decays @xmath58 ( see the section 4 ) .",
    "the introducing of the vector fields to the theory in a gauge way provides universality of coupling with vector fields , i.e. it strictly bounds the number of free parameters .",
    "so , this approach raises the predictability of the model .",
    "the analogous universality of vector and pseudoscalar meson interactions was analyzed in @xcite in a phenomenological way .",
    "physical states are formed by the primary fields mixing when mass quadratic forms of scalar and vector fields are diagonalized . at the tree level",
    "the mass forms arise as a result of vacuum shifts : @xmath59    note , the loop contributions to the mass matrix can play an essential role in the mixing of mesons .",
    "so , in a general case this matrix has the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is formed by the shifts and @xmath62 by the self - energy insertions . in our case",
    "these insertions are significant for the description of the @xmath63 mixing .    as the result of the diagonalization of vector and scalar mass forms , we get the model spectrum of the vector and scalar multiplets .",
    "the gauge status of vector mesons @xmath64 and @xmath65 is confirmed by the calculation of their model mass spectrum and decay properties .",
    "these model parameters are in agreement with the experimental data for dominant decay channels of vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of free parameters in the scalar sector , it is possible to describe the mass spectrum and decay channels of the scalar mesons @xmath30 ( or @xmath66 ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which have the status of higgs scalars in the model ( see also eqs.([e:14 ] ) and comment ) .",
    "an emergence of primary hadron component in the photon is an important consequence of the mixing in the gauge sector .",
    "the structure of the vector boson physical states can be illustrated in a tree approximation ( when @xmath67 ) by the following expressions : @xmath68 where the mixing angle @xmath69 is determined under the diagonalization of the vector fields quadratic form .",
    "due to the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) the processes with initial `` unphysical '' photon , @xmath70 , give contributions to the processes with the intermediate hadron states : @xmath71    some parameters of the mixing can be fixed from the experimental data on the vector meson decays .",
    "it will allows to describe some decays properties of vector mesons considered in this paper .",
    "the tree form of the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) is caused by the diagonalization of the real mass matrix ( this matrix is generated by the vacuum shifts only , without an account of any self - energy insertions ) with the help of the real orthogonal matrix .",
    "together with the tree real gauge couplings , it leads to the absence of the relative phase in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 channels at the tree level ( see ( [ e:12a ] ) ) .",
    "experiments , however , indicate that there is a nonzero relative phase shift between amplitudes of @xmath74 and @xmath75 processes ( it is interpreted as @xmath76 mixing effect in the pion formfactor ) .    in a phenomenological approach",
    ", the complexity is introduced into the superposition of pure isospin @xmath77 and @xmath78 states .",
    "so , the needed relative phase is a free parameter which is determined from the fit to the experiment  @xcite .",
    "note , such important feature of vector mesons physics as the @xmath79 mixing , can be reproduced in the model at the loop level . as a rule ,",
    "physical vector states of @xmath23 and @xmath22 mesons are described as linear combinations of pure isospin states with complex coefficients .",
    "it results to the relative @xmath80 mixing phase . in our model the complexity",
    "can not be directly introduced into the superposition of operator fields ( [ e:11 ] ) , because it describes the physical neutral fields . to reproduce the relative phase",
    ", we would treat the complexity in a following way .",
    "namely , instead of tree @xmath81 and @xmath82 we should have absolute values of the renormalized parameters of mixing in the superposition ( [ e:11 ] ) . then",
    ", the corresponding phase should be introduced into the renormalized couplings as the vertex factors ( see ( [ e:12a ] ) and ( [ e:12b ] ) ) .",
    "this treatment is equivalent to the known approach when physical meson states are the complex superpositions of pure isospin vector states  @xcite .",
    "the necessary phase value can be provided in the framework of this model due to presence of free parameters , in particular , in the scalar sector ( @xmath83 couplings ) .",
    "certainly , these free parameters should be fixed simultaneously from the analysis of the @xmath84- decays .",
    "for the processes , which are under consideration in this paper , the relative @xmath85 phase is inessential , so we do not use it here .",
    "an analysis of the vector mesons mass matrix with an account of loop contributions and the study of the @xmath86 mixing in the model will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "now , we give the main part of the physical lagrangian which will be used for calculations : @xmath87 in eqs.([e:12a ] ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the complex ( renormalized ) parameters of the @xmath91 mixing with account of the self - energy insertion to the mass matrix .",
    "there are also another parts of the interaction lagrangian , which have the structures @xmath92 and @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 are the sets of scalar and vector physical fields .",
    "the used identification of the gauge and higgs fields components provides the invariance of the physical lagrangian under the @xmath96 transformations .",
    "some relations arise as a direct consequences of the model : @xmath97    the value of @xmath98 can be found from the second relation @xmath99 .",
    "values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( or @xmath102 ) are fixed from the experimental values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "it should be noted , the last decay takes place due to the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) only .",
    "thus , we extract the values of main model parameters which we use to describe another decay properties of mesons : @xmath105 these values were applied for calculation of the vector meson radiative decay widths to verify the gauge vector dominance approach . in our strategy of calculations",
    "the strong couplings are extracted from the above mentioned processes as the effective final values .",
    "so , we do not need in loop corrections to these couplings . at the same time",
    ", electromagnetic vertices should be renormalized by the strong interactions ( for details , see the decay @xmath20 which is considered in the fourth section ) .",
    "in addition to ( [ e:12a ] ) we give also a part of the lagrangian , describing an interaction of the scalar mesons with @xmath38-mesons : @xmath106 this part of the lagrangian contains free coupling constants and makes it possible to describe the dominant decay channels of scalar mesons - @xmath107 and @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "the decay channel @xmath109 is not observed and from the model coupling @xmath110 it follows that @xmath111 .",
    "so , in the scalar sector the residual global @xmath9- symmetry approximately takes place after the shift .",
    "exact symmetry , @xmath112 , is not possible because it forbids the decay channel @xmath113 , which is observable experimentally .",
    "evidently , the inequality @xmath114 , violating the global isotopic @xmath9 symmetry , is related with an account of the electromagnetic interaction in the model .",
    "there are no two - photon decays of scalar mesons at the tree level , i.e. these channels are suppressed in the frame of the model .",
    "thus , the status of scalars as the higgs mesons does not contradict to their observed mass spectra and decay properties .",
    "because of the model two - level structure corresponding to the meson - meson and quark - meson interactions , both of them are tested independently in two - particle and three - particle channels .",
    "it is seen from ( [ e:12a ] ) that the meson - meson lagrangian describes both tree and loop level processes , while the quark - meson interactions occur in the model at the loop level only .",
    "radiative decays of neutral vector mesons of the type @xmath115 are an object of steady attention during some decades ( see @xcite and also @xcite-@xcite )",
    ". experimental investigation of these reactions and accompanied theoretical speculations contribute to the understanding of hadron intermediate states and low energy dynamic of meson interactions .    in the channels where the charged pair @xmath116 is formed , dominant contribution comes from tree diagrams corresponding to the vector dominance approximation @xcite .",
    "radiative decays @xmath117 and @xmath118 are described by meson - meson sector of the gauge model .    at the tree level",
    ", the former decay is represented by the diagrams in fig.1 .",
    "the total amplitude for the process is : @xmath119.\\ ] ] here @xmath120 and @xmath121 are polarization vectors for @xmath122 - meson and photon , @xmath123 are 4-momenta for all particles in the process . in ( [ e:1 ] )",
    "we omit all terms which are equal to zero on the mass shell in the transversal gauge . for comparison with the experimental spectrum of photons ( see the work of dolinsky , @xcite ) the differential width is presented in the form : @xmath124 where : @xmath125.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our numerical results , which follow from ( [ e:2 ] ) and ( [ e:3 ] ) , agree with the results of  @xcite given by the vector dominance approach . in fig.2 the theoretical spectrum of photons in comparison with the experimental data ( from  @xcite ) are represented .",
    "the curve ( 2 ) in fig.2 describes the spectrum @xmath126 , normalized by the total width . here",
    "@xmath127 , and it does not depend on the model coupling constants .",
    "the curve ( 1 ) represents the model fit of the experimental data with the help of a single free multiplicative parameter .",
    "as it is seen , this fitted curve ( 1 ) improves the prediction at the low energy range .",
    "this effect can be caused by the renormalization of @xmath128 coupling .    to improve the theoretical spectrum near @xmath129 it was suggested to consider the loop corrections ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , this consideration is reasonable only if the more detailed and reliable experimental data on the photon spectrum are available .",
    "integration of ( [ e:2 ] ) from @xmath130 up to @xmath131 gives the value of partial @xmath6- meson branching @xmath132 which slightly exceeds the experimental value @xmath133 from  @xcite .",
    "an account of the loop contributions ( with the phenomenological couplings ) leads to the result : @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there is some discrepancy between the experimental branching and the one following from the integration of spectrum ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "namely , an excess of @xmath135 over @xmath136 can be caused by the deviation of the theoretical spectrum from the experimental one at the energy range @xmath137 ( to the left of the first point of the experimental data in fig.2 ) .",
    "decay characteristics of the process @xmath138 at the tree level are computed analogously with the following replacement in ( [ e:1 ] ) - ( [ e:3 ] ) : @xmath139 in @xmath140 , and @xmath141 in @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the partial width for the decay is damped by the small mixing parameter , @xmath144 , so we have @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "these estimations do not contradict to the experimental restriction @xmath149  @xcite and agree with the theoretical results of  @xcite .",
    "thus , the same set of the fixed parameters ( the gauge constant and two mixing tree angles ) describes two different decays at the tree level .",
    "certainly , loop corrections can be important for the case due to the smallness of the tree contribution , see , for example  @xcite . in analogy with the results of these papers",
    ", loop corrections can increase @xmath150 up to @xmath151 , which does not contradict again to the upper limit of the experiment .",
    "as it was noted above , consideration of the loop corrections to the decay @xmath152 in @xcite-@xcite was intended to describe the photon spectrum fine structure .",
    "however , it increases the discrepancy between the model and experimental values of the total width .",
    "quantitatively , this effect depends on the underlying model .",
    "moreover , in effective theories an account of loop diagrams ( for some process arising at the tree level ) has some subtleties connected with the compensation of divergencies and renormalizability . for the processes which occur at the loop level only , these problems are absent  all divergencies are summed to zero when all external lines are on the mass shell  @xcite .",
    "an examples of such loop processes will be given in the next section .",
    "the usage of parameters from ( [ e:13 ] ) together with the constants @xmath153 and @xmath154 extracted from the widths of @xmath155 and @xmath156 decays , leads to the correct estimation of the cross section in the peaks vicinity , @xmath157 .    as it was noted above , the tree approximation ( without an account of the @xmath76 mixing at the loop level ) does not allow us to describe the resonance curve in this region in details .",
    "a relative @xmath85 phase consideration is a very essential for the resonance curve description .",
    "in the most papers these decays are defined by the phenomenological vertices which are introduced at the tree level @xcite . in the model considered , radiative decays @xmath161 and three - particle decays @xmath162 occur via quark loops with the gauge vertices .",
    "one - loop diagrams for the decays @xmath163 are shown in fig.3 , where @xmath164 denote quark fields .",
    "total amplitude for the process @xmath165 has the following form @xmath166 here @xmath167 is the color factor , vertex constant @xmath168 ( @xmath169 is the constant of @xmath170-interaction , see ( [ e:12a ] ) ) and @xmath171 is the three - point passarino - veltman function @xcite . for the constituent quark mass",
    "we suppose @xmath172 . substituting the function @xmath173 into ( [ e:4 ] )",
    ", we have : @xmath174 where @xmath175 and the decay constant @xmath176 .",
    "in ( [ e:5 ] ) it was used the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath177 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it defines the coupling @xmath169 through the constituent quark mass .",
    "then the constituent quark mass value , which is taken as a free parameter , can be found from the widths fit .",
    "the decay @xmath178 is described by the diagrams in fig.3 with the corresponding replacement of the coupling constant .",
    "the expression for the width is @xmath179 follows from the isotopic structure of @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 vertices ( [ e:12a])-([e:12b ] ) ( here we omit small terms proportional to @xmath183 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "both the widths are in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite when the effective quark mass value is @xmath184 : @xmath185 thus , the fitting of two widths by one model parameter - mass of the constituent quark @xmath186 , gives @xmath187 .",
    "this quark mass value can be understood in a connection with the schematic representation of the quark - gluon content of hadrons .",
    "specifically , for the nucleon and @xmath6- meson masses we can write approximately @xmath188    here we use an effective quark mass , @xmath186 , and suppose the same gluon component of meson and baryon structure , @xmath189",
    ". from this system of equations it follows @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the latest value nearly coincides with the quark mass assessment resulting from the decay channels analysis .",
    "note that a sufficiently low quark mass value @xmath192 together with the @xmath193 are followed from the composite - meson model with the four - quark interaction  @xcite .",
    "so , the model discussed introduces the constituent quark which is differed from the traditional effective quark component of a hadron with @xmath194 ( see , however ,  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath189 makes it possible to interpret the meson @xmath195 as the ( mostly ) glueball state  @xcite .",
    "it does not contradict to some known ideas on the gluon nature of @xmath196 meson ( see  @xcite and references therein for the review of scalar meson properties ) .",
    "if it is the case , the low value of the constituent quark mass can be treated as the consequence of a model separation of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom in a hadron .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath186 , which is essentially lower than @xmath197 , provides the agreement of the model results with the experiment for the processes under consideration .    of course",
    ", if we explanate the @xmath30-meson as the effective glueball state , we need in an detailed analysis of its properties and manifestations in the model .",
    "this studying will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note also that the @xmath196 meson was carefully analyzed , supposing the meson is a @xmath198 state , in  @xcite , for instance .    in an analogy with the process @xmath199 ,",
    "the decays under consideration can contain an anomaly contribution caused by the @xmath200 vertex .",
    "this contribution is small here due to the smallness of the ratio @xmath201 , that is approximation @xmath202 takes place with a good accuracy .",
    "it is known that the same approximation is not admissible for the decay @xmath203 , where the anomaly contribution dominates .",
    "an analysis of this decay in our model is coincide with the one in  @xcite , for example .",
    "namely , due to the dominant anomaly contribution , the decay amplitude is again @xmath204 i.e. it depends on the @xmath205 and does not contain the quark mass .",
    "the constant @xmath205 arises in the amplitude from pion - quark coupling which is @xmath206 , as it dictates by the goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "so , our value of the quark mass corresponds to the ( lower ) pion - quark coupling , @xmath169 , providing , however , the reasonable values for @xmath207 widths .",
    "note also that in the consideration of loop three - particle decays @xmath208 we will have in this model a non - negligible ratio @xmath209 as a consequence of this relatively low quark mass ( cf . with  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , an accurate calculations give for @xmath210 the values which are in agreement with the data ( these results will be discussed in the forthcoming work too ) .",
    "one of the most important features of the model is the implantation of electromagnetic ( em ) interaction into the gauge scheme of strong interactions .",
    "the mixing of the gauge fields leads to the effect of mutual renormalization of the interaction couplings .",
    "now we discuss the decay @xmath20 which is caused mainly by the em interaction . at the tree level this process is described by the vertex following from ( [ e:10 ] ) and the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) .",
    "corresponding decay coupling is @xmath211 , so it gives @xmath212 , while the experimental decay rate is @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "here we show that this discrepancy can be eliminated due to renormalization of the decay coupling @xmath153 by the strong interactions . in the one - loop approximation",
