    "the quantum rabi model  @xcite , one of the fundamental models in quantum optics , describes the light - matter interaction between a quantum two - level system ( atom , qubit ) and a bosonic field ( optical mode , microwave mode ) .",
    "based on the coupling strength between the two - level system and the quantum field , the quantum rabi model possesses two important parameter regimes . for an interaction strength much smaller than the frequencies of the atom and the field ( which are near resonance )",
    ", the quantum rabi hamiltonian can be reduced to the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian  @xcite under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , i.e. , the counter - rotating ( cr ) terms in the interaction can be omitted , and the model can be solved analytically with simple functions .",
    "this is the so - called jc regime , which can be further divided into weak- and strong - coupling cases  @xcite .",
    "cavity - qed systems formed by natural atoms coupled to optical cavities are well within this regime , which makes the jc model one of the most significant models in quantum optics .",
    "the other interesting regime is the ultrastrong - coupling regime , where the light - matter coupling strength reaches a considerable fraction of the atom and the cavity frequencies . in this regime ,",
    "the rwa is no longer valid , and the cr interactions strongly modify the eigenenergies of the jc model  @xcite . to date , the ultrastrong - coupling regime has been demonstrated in superconducting circuits  @xcite and semiconductor microcavities  @xcite , with coupling strengths exceeding @xmath0 of the qubit or the cavity frequency",
    ". moreover , the ultrastrong - coupling regime can be simulated with various cavity - qed  @xcite and circuit - qed  @xcite systems . recently ,",
    "even the deep - strong - coupling regime has been reported , with a coupling strength comparable or larger than the qubit or the cavity frequency  @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", enormous effort has been devoted towards the study of the ultrastrong - coupling regime in the quantum rabi model .",
    "it was found that the cr terms can induce novel quantum phenomena : such as asymmetry of the vacuum rabi - splitting  @xcite , virtual - photon - induced vacuum rabi oscillation  @xcite , superradiance transition  @xcite , non - classical photon statistics  @xcite , spontaneous release of virtual photons  @xcite , and multi - photon sideband transitions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , interesting quantum dynamical phenomena have been reported , such as collapse and revival of quantum states  @xcite , quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects  @xcite , single - photon scattering  @xcite , collective spontaneous emission in multi - atom systems  @xcite , and multiphoton quantum rabi oscillations  @xcite .",
    "owing to the versatile effects generated by the cr interactions , it becomes an interesting topic to develop techniques to control the cr interactions in the quantum rabi model  @xcite .",
    "manipulating the cr interactions can help us observe virtual photon effects in weak- or strong - coupling systems ; whereas in ultrastrong - coupling regime , these techniques can help us suppress virtual photon effects . for example , liberato  _ et al . _",
    "proposed a method to enhance virtual photon processes , which requires the coupling strength to oscillate at twice the frequency of the cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "huang and law proposed a scheme to control the cr interactions using a sequence of phase kicks  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a practical approach to manipulate the light - matter coupling in the quantum rabi model by introducing a monochromatic modulation of the transition frequency of the quantum two - level system .",
    "this frequency modulation induces a series of sidebands in the spectrum of the quantum two - level system , and affects the detunings between the two - level system and the cavity mode . by engineering appropriate modulation frequency and amplitude , the detunings and the effective coupling strengths between the two - level system and the cavity",
    "can be controlled to make desired transitions on resonance and unwanted transitions far off - resonance . with this approach",
    ", we can enhance the cr interactions in the weak- or strong - coupling regime , and suppress the cr interactions in the ultrastrong - coupling regime .",

    "finally , we present brief discussions on the implementation of this scheme with circuit - qed systems .",
    "the rabi model can be realized by coupling a superconducting qubit with a transmission line resonator . here",
    "the two - level system can be either a transmon qubit or a flux qubit .",
    "the resonance frequencies of the qubit and the resonator can be in the range of @xmath175 - @xmath176 ghz .",
    "the coupling strength between the qubit and resonator can be in either the strong- or the ultrastrong - coupling regimes ( from hundreds of megahertz to some exceed one gigahertz ) .",
    "for example , @xmath177 @xmath178 - @xmath179  @xcite in accordance with the parameters used in our scheme .",
    "the frequency modulation in the qubit hamiltonian can be implemented by applying a periodic driving field on the qubit .",
    "depending on the design of the qubit , the driving field can be introduced by using proper gate voltage or biased magnetic flux  @xcite . by tuning the driving amplitude and frequency , the modulation parameters @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath16 can be chosen on demand .",
    "similar modulation schemes in experiments have been studied in  @xcite , and can be efficiently accessed following  @xcite .    in conclusion , we have proposed a method to control the cr interactions in the quantum rabi model by introducing a sinusoidal modulation to the frequency of the quantum two - level system .",
    "this control scheme includes the enhancement of the cr interactions in the jc regime and the suppression of these terms in the ultrastrong - coupling regime . by designing proper modulation frequency and amplitude , the rotating and cr interactions in the rabi model",
    "can be tailored to be either resonant or far off - resonant . in these cases ,",
    "we have derived effective hamiltonians to describe the dynamics of this system and verified detailed parameter conditions under which the approximations are valid .",
    "we have also studied the evolution of the state population in this system , which shows clear evidence of the manipulation of the interaction terms .",
    "in addition , we have investigated photon emission in the enhancement case by calculating the output photon flux rate .",
    "a continuous photon emission from the cavity vacuum in the jc regime is obtained .",
