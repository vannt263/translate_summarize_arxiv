    "recent detection of the gravitational wave perturbation by bicep2  @xcite indicates its large amplitude and its tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath0 for a lensed-@xmath1cdm plus tensor mode cosmological model , and @xmath2 after foreground subtraction based on dust models .",
    "this implies that the energy scale of inflation is high and the inflation potential would belong to the so - called large field model , where an inflaton takes a super - planckian field value , such as chaotic inflation  @xcite .    however , it is non - trivial to control a flat potential with a super - planckian field value .",
    "an axion is one of the interesting candidates for inflaton fields , because it has a shift symmetry and its potential would be flat for a super - planckian field value . in this sense ,",
    "the so - called natural inflation  @xcite is interesting , and when studied in light of the bicep2 data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , axion monodromy inflation @xcite has been proposed as an axion inflation model within the framework of low - energy effective field theory derived from superstring theory ( see also @xcite ) . while in natural inflation the potential form is a sinusoidal function , in a simple axion monodromy model the potential is a linear function of the inflaton , @xmath3 . with @xmath4 being",
    "a fractional number is also possible .",
    "in addition , such a potential can be also derived by field - theoretical strong dynamics  @xcite or by non - canonical kinetic terms  @xcite . ]",
    "axion monodromy inflation with the linear potential is compatible with the data .",
    "however , if we examine it in detail , there are a few issues .",
    "one is that the linear potential inflation predicts the scalar spectral index @xmath5 as indicated by planck  @xcite and @xmath6 .",
    "the predicted @xmath7 looks a bit too small compared with bicep2 results even if we compare with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bicep2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "another is a tension between bicep2 and planck , which is a problem not only for this particular model but for most inflation models .",
    "bicep2 reported a somewhat larger tensor - to - scalar ratio than the upper bound @xmath8 obtained by planck . as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tension can be relaxed if the running of the scalar spectral index , @xmath9 , is negatively large as @xmath10(0.02 - 0.03 ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper , we study the inflation model driven by the linear potential derived from the axion monodromy inflation model , taking a correction term for non - perturbative effects into account .",
    "that is , non - perturbative effects would generate a correction term for the axion in the potential , whose form is the sinusoidal function .",
    "such a correction was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it has been neglected because it is subdominant in the potential",
    ". however , we point out non - negligible contributions by the correction term in derivatives of the potential . and @xmath11 without considering tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "] since the slow roll parameters are expressed in terms of the derivatives of the potential , the resultant correction in the slow roll parameters is quite important in the evaluation of the inflationary observables .",
    "thus , we study the inflation potential with the linear term and sinusoidal term .",
    "our purpose is two - fold , and we study two scenarios for each of these .",
    "first , we point out that the sinusoidal correction term increases the predicted @xmath7 to as much as 0.1 - 0.15 for the number of e - folds @xmath12 50 - 60 , which corresponds to the cosmological scale @xmath13 .",
    "this size of @xmath7 is within the range of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bicep2 - 2 ] ) as reported by bicep2 .",
    "we estimate observables @xmath14 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 for several parameter sets in our model .",
    "next , we study the case where @xmath15 0.1 - 0.2 and the tension between bicep2 and planck is resolved by a large negative running @xmath9 .",
    "the sinusoidal correction term can induce negative running by its potential derivatives ; however , the size is not enough as long as we assume that both the horizon and the flatness problem are solved only by this axion monodromy inflation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we regard this monodromy inflation as the first stage in the double inflation scenario  @xcite followed by another inflation , we can obtain favored values of the observables @xmath16 . in a previous work , this kind of possibility was studied by two of the present authors ( t. k. and o. s. ) in the context of the supersymmetric hybrid inflation model  @xcite . from double inflation was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we explain our model explicitly . in sect .",
    "iii , we study observables derived from our model in both the single and double inflation scenarios .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "before showing our model explicitly , we note the definition of several quantities and show several formulas .",
    "we use units with @xmath17 .",
    "the slow - roll parameters for the inflation potential @xmath18 of the inflaton @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the first derivative of @xmath18 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 have similar meanings .",
    "the power spectrum of the density perturbation is given by @xmath24 in the following analysis , a parameter which represents the height of the scalar potential is normalized by this with the amplitude of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the scalar spectral index , its running and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are expressed as @xmath25 respectively by use of the above slow - roll parameters . also the number of e - folds is evaluated as @xmath26 where @xmath19 at the upper bound of the integral is the field value when the number of e - folds is @xmath27 counting from the end of inflation , and @xmath28 denotes the field value at the end time of inflation .    for @xmath5 and @xmath29 , we find @xmath30 and @xmath31 from eqs .",
    "( [ formula : ns ] ) and ( [ formula : rt ] ) .",
    "then , with vanishing @xmath32 , we expect @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is important to realize a large negative value of @xmath9 , and @xmath34 is required for @xmath35 .",
    "now we write the inflation potential of our model , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants .",
    "the first linear term of @xmath42 would appear in the large @xmath42 limit from the term @xmath43 , which could originate from the dirac - born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "we assume that the second term is generated by non - perturbative effects .",
    "indeed , this was also mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it has been neglected because it may be subdominant . however , as we will show , even if it is subdominant in @xmath18 , it would be important in the derivatives , in particular the second and third derivatives of the potential .",
    "thus , we consider both the first and second term . we have added the constant @xmath41 such that @xmath44 at the potential minimum . however , when the second term is subdominant in the potential , we can see that the constant @xmath41 is neglected",
    ". using this potential , we will study the single and double inflation scenarios in the next section .",
    "here , we consider the case that the axion monodromy inflation expands enough to solve the horizon and flatness problem and study other observables .",
    "let us call this case the single inflation scenario , where the cosmological scale corresponds to @xmath12 50 - 60 .",
    "first of all , the limit with @xmath45 is quite simple .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 then , when @xmath48 , we estimate @xmath49 which are consistent with planck and bicep2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", we estimate the running as @xmath50 . a large negative value of @xmath9 is not realized in this case . that is obvious because in this case we can write @xmath51 we would have a large negative @xmath9 for smaller @xmath27 .",
    "however , in this case , @xmath14 becomes too small .",
    "next , we consider the potential with non - vanishing @xmath38 . then , the slow - roll parameters can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we show the modification of axion monodromy inflation by including the non - perturbative correction of the sinusoidal term in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .    for large @xmath42",
    ", we could approximate @xmath56 for example , when @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 . then",
    ", we have a factor of @xmath59 enhancement on @xmath60 , which results in that on @xmath7 as well , for a fixed value of @xmath42 .",
    "even for @xmath61 , we would have significant shifts on @xmath60 and @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath60 becomes larger , @xmath14 becomes smaller than 0.96 .",
    "we have to cancel such a shift of @xmath14 by increasing @xmath62 to keep @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the case with @xmath64 is not realistic , but both @xmath65 and @xmath66 must be of @xmath67-@xmath68 .",
    "it is also favorable that both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are negative . in this case",
    ", @xmath32 is always negative , thus @xmath9 are mostly positive and can be only tiny negative . at first . because of @xmath71",
    ", we are required to obtain @xmath72 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath73 in eq.(19 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain smaller @xmath7 than the linear potential without the sinusoidal term , i.e. @xmath74 . here",
    ", we concentrate on the linear potential with the sinusoidal correction .",
    "if we consider the potential term @xmath75 instead of the linear term , the situation would change . for @xmath76",
    ", we already obtain @xmath77 without the sinusoidal term .",
    "again we need @xmath72 to realize a large negative @xmath9 and it has a negative correction on @xmath7 .",
    "however , even including such a negative correction , we can realize @xmath78 for @xmath76 .",
    "] from the above reasoning , it is impossible to realize @xmath79 , @xmath5 , @xmath78 and a large negative @xmath9 simultaneously .",
    "we show some examples in table  [ tab : single ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nsrt ] , where we fix @xmath80 and @xmath40 can be obtained as @xmath81 .",
    ".results in the single inflation scenario [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as mentioned above , we assume that the second inflation follows after the above monodromy inflation occurs such that the total number of e - folds becomes @xmath82 or more . in principle , any inflation model can be allowed and there is no constraint at present .",
    "hence , we do not analyze its model - dependent detail here .",
    "we have studied axion monodromy inflation with a sinusoidal correction term .",
    "we find the sinusoidal correction term is important in estimating inflationary observables ; in fact , @xmath14 and @xmath7 are significantly affected by the correction .",
    "we have shown that a larger tensor - to - scalar ratio compatible with the recent bicep2 results can be obtained in both the single and double inflation scenarios .",
    "a large negative running of the spectral index can be realized in the double inflation scenario , whose first stage is driven by our monodromy inflation model with sinusoidal correction term .",
