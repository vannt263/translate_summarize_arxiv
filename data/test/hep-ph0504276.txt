    "the most predictive grand unified theory ( gut ) based on an @xmath0 gauge symmetry is a minimal non - supersymmetric model of georgi and glashow  @xcite ( gg ) .",
    "however , the failure to accommodate experimentally observed fermion masses and mixing and to unify electroweak and strong forces decisively rule it out .",
    "nevertheless , the main features of the underlying theory , e.g , partial matter unification and one - step symmetry breaking , are so appealing that there has been a number of proposals to enlarge its structure by adding more representations to have the theory in agreement with experimental data .",
    "since the number of possible extensions is large it is important to answer the following question .",
    "what is the minimal number of extra particles that renders an @xmath0 gauge theory realistic ?",
    "such an extension of the gg model with the smallest possible number of extra particles that furnish full @xmath0 representation(s ) has all prerequisites to be the most predictive one .",
    "thus , if there is a definite answer to the first question it is important to ask the second one : what are the possible experimental signatures and associated uncertainties of such a minimal setup ? if uncertainties of the minimal extension are significant the same is even more true of a more complicated structure unless additional assumptions are imposed .",
    "we address both questions in great detail and present truly minimal , i.e. , minimal in terms of number of fields , realistic non - supersymmetric @xmath0 scenario .",
    "as we demonstrate later , unification , in the minimal scenario , points towards existence of light scalar leptoquarks which could generate very rich phenomenological signatures .",
    "these are looked for in the direct search experiments as well as in the experiments looking for rare processes .",
    "their presence generates novel proton decay contributions which can be very important .",
    "moreover , since in our scheme their coupling to matter is through the majorana neutrino yukawas , their observation might even allow measurements of and/or provide constraints on neutrino yukawa coupling entries .",
    "this makes our scenario extremely attractive . at the same time ,",
    "rather low scale of vector leptoquarks that is inherent in non - supersymmetric theories exposes our scenario to the tests via nucleon lifetime measurements .",
    "we investigate all relevant experimental signatures of the scenario , including its status with respect to the present bounds on nucleon lifetime .    in the next section",
    "we define our framework . in section  [ iii ]",
    "we discuss how it is possible to get gauge couplings unification in agreement with low energy data .",
    "then , in section  [ iv ] we discuss possible experimental signatures of the minimal scenario .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "appendix  [ first ] contains relevant details and notation of the minimal non - supersymmetric realistic @xmath0 we refer to throughout the manuscript .",
    "the origin of theoretical bounds on the familiar gauge @xmath4 proton decay operators is critically analyzed in appendix  [ second ] .",
    "appendix  [ third ] contains details on the two - loop running of the gauge couplings that is presented for completeness of our work .",
    "in order to motivate the minimal @xmath0 grand unifying theory ( gut ) , where we define such a theory to be the one with the smallest possible particle content that renders it realistic , we first revisit the gg model  @xcite and discuss its shortcomings . only then do we present the minimal realistic scenario and investigate its experimental signatures and related uncertainties .",
    "the gg model fails from the phenomenological point of view for a number of reasons :    1 .   it does not incorporate massive neutrinos ; 2 .",
    "it yields charged fermion mass ratios in gross violation of experimentally observed values ; 3 .   it can not account for the gauge coupling unification .",
    "( for one of the first rulings on ( non)unification see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the first flaw is easy to fix ; one either introduces three right - handed neutrinos ",
    "singlets of the standard model ( sm)to use a type i see - saw mechanism  @xcite to generate their mass or adds a higgs field ",
    "a @xmath1 of @xmath0to generate neutrino mass through the so - called type ii see - saw  @xcite .",
    "one might also use the combination of the two . the fourth option to use the planck mass suppressed higher - dimensional operators  @xcite does not look promising since it generates too small scale for neutrino mass to explain the atmospheric and solar neutrino data .",
    "nevertheless , it might still play an important role  @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention on the second option , i.e. , addition of @xmath1 , in view of the fact that the right - handed neutrinos , being singlets of the sm , do not contribute to the running . hence , their mass scale can not be sufficiently well determined or constrained unless additional assumptions are introduced",
    ".    the second flaw can be fixed by either introducing the higher - dimensional operators in the yukawa sector  @xcite or resorting to a more complicated higgs sector _",
    " la _ georgi and jarlskog  @xcite .",
    "the former approach introduces a lot more parameters into the model ( see for example  @xcite ) but unlike in the neutrino case these operators might have just a right strength to modify  bad \" mass predictions for the charged fermions . in order to keep as minimal as possible the number of particles we opt for the scenario with the non - renormalizable terms .",
    "the third flaw requires presence of additional non - trivial split representations besides those of the gg @xmath0 model .",
    "it can thus be fixed in conjunction with the first and second one .",
    "for example , introduction of an extra @xmath5 of higgs to fix mass ratios of charged fermions _",
    " la _ georgi and jarlskog  @xcite allows one to achieve unification and , at the same time , raise the scale relevant for proton decay .",
    "( for the studies on the influence of an extra @xmath5 on the running and other predictions see for example  @xcite . )",
    "we will see that the addition of one extra @xmath1 of higgs plays a crucial role in achieving the unification in our case .",
    "so , what we have in mind as the minimal realistic @xmath0 model is the gg model supplemented by the @xmath1 of higgs to generate neutrino mass and which incorporates non - renormalizable effects to fix the yukawa sector of charged fermions .",
    "we analyze exclusively non - supersymmetric scenario for the following three reasons : first , this guarantees the minimality of the number of fields ; second , there are no problems with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 proton decay operators ; third , since the grand unifying scale is lower than in supersymmetric scenario the setup could possibly be verified or excluded in the next generation of proton decay experiments .",
    "the main prediction , besides the proton decay , of any gut is the unification of the strong and electroweak forces .",
    "we thus show that it is possible to achieve gauge coupling unification in a consistent way in our scenario .    at the one - loop level",
    "the running of gauge couplings is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 are the appropriate one - loop coefficients  @xcite and @xmath14 represents the gauge coupling at the unifying scale @xmath15 .",
    "the sm coefficients for the case of @xmath16 light higgs doublet fields are : @xmath17 even though the sm coefficients do not generate unification in both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 case for any value of @xmath20 and @xmath15 that is not an issue since the sm does not predict the gauge coupling unification in the first place . on the other hand",
    ", a gut , which does predict one , automatically introduces a number of additional particles with respect to the sm case that , if light enough , can change the outcome of the sm running .",
    "this change is easily incorporated if one replaces @xmath13 in eq .   with the effective one - loop coefficients @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the one - loop coefficients of any additional particle @xmath24 of mass @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "basically , given a particle content of the gut and eqs .",
    "and   we can investigate if the unification is possible .",
    "following giveon _",
    "@xcite , eqs .   can be further rewritten in a more suitable form in terms of differences in the effective coefficients @xmath27 and low energy observables .",
    "they find two relations that hold at @xmath28 :    @xmath29    adopting the following experimental values at @xmath28 in the @xmath30 scheme  @xcite : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we obtain    [ conditions ] @xmath34    last two equations allow us to constrain the mass spectrum of additional particles that leads to an exact unification at @xmath15 .",
    "( in what follows we consistently use central values presented in eqs .   unless specified otherwise .",
    "the inclusion of the two - loop effects and threshold corrections is addressed in detail in appendix  [ third ] . )",
    "the fact that the sm with one ( two ) higgs doublet(s ) can not yield unification is now more transparent in light of eq .  .",
    "namely , the resulting sm ratio is simply too small ( @xmath35 for @xmath18 ) to satisfy equality in eq .  .",
    "what is needed is one or more particles that are relatively light and with suitable @xmath13 coefficients that can increase the value of the @xmath36 ratio .",
    "the most efficient enhancement is realized by a field that increases @xmath37 and decreases @xmath38 simultaneously .",
    "for example , light higgs doublet is such a field ( see the @xmath39 coefficients in table  [ tab : table2 ] ) and it takes at least eight of them , at the one - loop level , to bring @xmath36 in accord with experiments .",
    "other fields that could generate the same type of improvement in our scenario are light @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 coefficients of all the particles in our scenario are presented in table  [ tab : table2 ] and the relevant notation is set in appendix  [ first ] .",
    ".[tab : table2 ] contributions to the @xmath43coefficients .",
    "the mass of the sm higgs doublet is taken to be at @xmath28 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that lower bounds are well defined for the partial lifetimes while upper bound is meaningful for the total lifetime only .",
    "finally , we can establish the theoretical bounds for the lifetime of the proton in any given gut . in what follows we use @xmath44 these bounds are useful since we can say something more specific about the allowed values of @xmath45 or @xmath20 or both .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath20 we can put lower limit on the value of @xmath45 using experimental data on nucleon lifetime .",
    "also , given the value of @xmath45 and @xmath20 we can set the limits on the proton lifetime range within the given scenario .",
    "we present the details on the two - loop running . in order to maximize @xmath45",
    "one needs extremely light @xmath46 . in",
    "any given mass splitting scheme we thus set the mass of @xmath46 at @xmath47gev which is just above the present experimental limit of @xmath48gev .",
    "then , @xmath49 or @xmath50 or both are allowed to vary between @xmath51 and @xmath15 in order to yield unification and all other fields except for the sm ones are taken to be at the gut scale .",
    "the identification @xmath52 is justified through the inclusion of boundary conditions at the gut scale  @xcite @xmath53 and the relevant two - loop equations for the running of the gauge couplings take the well - known form @xmath54 @xmath13 and @xmath55 coefficients for the sm case for arbitrary @xmath16 are well - documented ( see  @xcite for general formula ) . in addition to those we have : @xmath56 @xmath57 which should be added to the sm ones at the appropriate particle mass scale . the two - loop yukawa coupling contribution to the running of the gauge couplings ( with the corresponding one - loop running of yukawas )",
    "is _ not _ included in order to make meaningful comparison between @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases .",
    "( for the @xmath19 case one vacuum expectation value of the light higgs doublets is arbitrary and needs to be specified in order to extract fermion yukawas for the running , i.e. @xmath58 ambiguity .",
    "there is no such ambiguity present in the @xmath18 case since the only low - energy vacuum expectation value is accurately determined by electroweak precision measurements . )",

    "vertical lines mark the relevant scales : @xmath28 , @xmath59gev , @xmath64gev and @xmath65gev.,width=432 ]    the gut scale as well as appropriate intermediate scales are indicated on the plots .",
    "for example , in the @xmath19 scenario with light @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ figure:6 ] the gut scale is close to the one - loop results ( see fig .",
    "[ figure:1 ] in particular ) and comes out to be @xmath66gev for central values of coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 departure allows for the maximum value of @xmath68gev in that case .",
    "note that the @xmath18 case with light @xmath49 presented in fig .",
    "[ figure:7 ] yields somewhat higher gut scale .",
    "the reason behind this trend is simple : the @xmath46 contribution to @xmath38 is seven times that of the higgs doublet but , at the same time , they contribute the same to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 is more efficient in simultaneously improving the running and raising the gut scale than any extra higgs doublets",
    ".    one might object that lightness of @xmath49 , which requires miraculous fine - tuning , makes the scenario with an extra @xmath1 rather unattractive .",
    "again , we do not insist on @xmath49 being at intermediate scale . note that the unification with almost the same gut scale as in the intermediate @xmath49 case is achieved at the two - loop level in the scenario where @xmath50 is at intermediate and @xmath49",
    "is at the gut scale .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ figure:4 ] and  [ figure:8 ] for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases , respectively . as discussed in the text , intermediate scale for @xmath50 would require either small yukawas for majorana neutrinos or small @xmath69 . in the latter case",
    ", the novel contributions towards proton decay would be automatically suppressed . the former case could be probed if and when the leptoquarks are detected since some of the rare processes involving neutrinos would be significantly suppressed compared with the charged lepton ones .",
    "we note that in the scenario with intermediate @xmath50 the gut scale grows with the number of light higgs doublets in contrast to the case when @xmath49 is at the intermediate scale .",
    "again , the reason is that the @xmath38 coefficient of @xmath50 is the same as the appropriate coefficient of the higgs doublet but its contribution to @xmath37 is four times bigger .",
    "thus , the very efficiency of @xmath50 in improving unification makes its impact on @xmath15 rather small .",
