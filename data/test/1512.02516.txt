    "work belongs to the most basic notions of classical mechanics and also presents one of the cornerstones of thermodynamics . with the recent experimental progress in the fields of cold atoms@xcite , nano - mechanics , and opto - mechanics , @xcite to name just a few",
    ", there is an urgent need of a theoretical foundation of what work means in quantum mechanics and how it can be defined in an operational way .",
    "one reason why work does not simply fall into the category of observables like position , linear and angular momentum , and energy , comes from the fact that it is meant to characterize a process rather than an instantaneous state of a system @xcite . even in the simple case of a thermally isolated system the determination of work requires an interference of the system with a measurement device at two times . for a classical system",
    ", the interaction between the system and the measurement device can be made arbitrarily weak and , hence , the back - action can be arbitrarily small , without implying a principle limitation of the precision of the measurement .",
    "however , for a quantum systems , the back - action of the measurement device modifies the state of the system ; it consequently influences the outcome of a subsequent contact , therefore influencing the final value of the work @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ classical ] we survey various definitions of work that classically are equivalent to each other .",
    "we review in more detail the operational definition in terms of two projective energy measurements in section [ tema ] . in section [ twoenergy ]",
    "we discuss a gaussian energy measurement scheme which then is employed in a two gaussian energy measurement device . a recently proposed approach to determine work by a single",
    ", necessarily generalized measurement @xcite is discussed in section[meter ] for a gaussian pointer .",
    "a work - meter that functions in that way operates with a precision determined by a parameter combining the strength of the measurement and the covariance matrix of the gaussian initial pointer state .",
    "implementing a high precision the result of two projective energy measurements is recovered while the use of low precision leads to broad distributions yet with a finite average .",
    "a spin in a suddenly changing magnetic field serves as an example in section [ example ] .",
    "section [ con ] concludes the paper .",
    "restricting ourselves to thermally isolated systems we begin with the discussion of work in classical systems .",
    "when a classical system stays at a phase space point @xmath0 its energy is determined by the value of a conveniently chosen hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite which also governs the dynamics of the system .",
    "a change of the parameter @xmath2 according to a protocol @xmath3 alters the energy and hence work will be applied to or taken from the system .",
    "we shall adopt the inclusive definition of work @xcite according to which the work is given by the energy - difference at the end and the beginning of the force protocol , @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the phase space point that evolves from @xmath6 according to the hamiltonian dynamics , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the poisson bracket .",
    "as already mentioned , within the time - range @xmath9 $ ] the parameter @xmath10 changes according to a prescribed protocol @xmath11 . for classical systems",
    "an equivalent definition of work is based on the fact that the energy difference can be expressed as an integral of the total time - derivative of the hamiltonian , which coincides with the respective partial derivative yielding the work as integral of the supplied power , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the time - derivative of the force parameter @xmath10 .",
    "any adaptation of the two work definitions ( [ whhcl ] ) and ( [ wpower ] ) to quantum systems must take into account the back - actions of those measurements that have to be performed in order to determine the work .",
    "it is this inherently quantum - mechanical requirement that renders the two classically equivalent definitions ( [ whhcl ] ) and ( [ wpower ] ) inequivalent @xcite .",
    "based on the energy difference definition ( [ whhcl ] ) work can be determined by the _ two energy measurement approach _ @xcite which employs two projective measurements of energy at the end and the beginning of the force protocol . due to the projective nature of these measurements , two energy - eigenvalues @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are obtained . from these eigenvalues",
    "the work in a single realization of the protocol is determined as the difference @xmath16 . with this definition",
    "the statistics of work complies with the fluctuation relations of jarzynski @xcite and crooks @xcite for systems initially staying in a canonical initial state @xcite .",
    "a quite different picture emerges if one tries to implement the power based approach @xcite .",
    "this , in principle , requires a continuous observation of the system in such a way that the time - evolution of the power can be inferred .",
    "even if this monitoring is not performed by means of projective measurements but in a weaker way , a continuous observation will freeze the dynamics of the system due to the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "for relatively slowly varying protocols one might try to circumvent the zeno effect by restricting the observations to a discrete set of times with a suitably chosen strength of observation . yet the resulting statistics of work turn out to be essentially determined by the number and strength of the observations and only to a lesser extent by the force protocol .",
    "there are hardly any relations between the statistics obtained by the two energy measurement and the power approach .",
    "in particular , the fluctuation relations of crooks and jarzynski are only satisfied for the power approach if the hamiltonians at all different parameter values commute with each other @xcite .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the fact that measurements during the force protocol leave these fluctuation relations unchanged as long as the work is determined by two projective measurements at the beginning and the end of the force protocol @xcite .",
    "we finally note that in various attempts to formulate a `` quantum thermodynamics '' @xcite work is understood in a way such that its mean - value coincides with the difference of the mean - values of the energies at the end and the beginning of the force - protocol , however , without taking into account the back - action of the first onto the second measurement . in order to distinguish this notion of a work - like quantity from operational definitions that include the back - action of measurements we call it `` untouched work '' @xcite . in this sense , work is always untouched in classical mechanics .",
    "the defining property of untouched work hence postulates that its average @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 where the density matrix @xmath19 describes the initial state and @xmath20 denotes the unitary time - evolution of the system over the extension of the force protocol , following as the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the unit operator on the hilbert space of the system .    for later use",
    ", we introduce the spectral resolution of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath23 in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath24 and corresponding projection operators @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be represented as @xmath29 we will make frequent use of this representation in the sequel for the initial and final times @xmath30 , respectively .    a way to obtain the average untouched work would be to prepare two copies of an ensemble representing the initial state of the system . the first ensemble is then used to determine its average energy in the standard way by projective measurements of the initial energy .",
    "the ensemble which is generated by this measurement need not coincide with the one prior to the measurement and is discarded after the measurement .",
    "the force protocol is applied on the members of the second ensemble and upon its completion the energy is measured and its average calculated .",
    "the difference of the two average energies coincides with the average of the untouched energy .",
    "it only agrees with the average work obtained by the above mentioned two energy measurement approach if the discarded ensemble was identical with the original one .",
    "this is the case for an initial state that is stationary with respect to the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the given prescription though is incomplete in that it only determines an average value but does not allow to determine fluctuations in a meaningful way @xcite .",
    "attempts to define the work as an observable in terms of the difference of the initial and final hamiltonians in the heisenberg - picture @xcite disregard the inherent process - dependence of work @xcite . also for a canonical initial state , the jarzynski and crooks relations do not hold with this definition apart from the trivial , yet untypical case of commuting hamiltonians , @xmath31=0 $ ] for all @xmath32 .    in a recent effort ,",
    "allahverdyan @xcite suggested a characterization of untouched work as a fluctuating quantity which indeed yields ( [ varw ] ) for the average . the statistics of this hypothetical object is determined in @xcite by a pdf - like function @xmath33 the weight @xmath34 is a quasi - probability for the eigenvalues of the two hamiltonians @xmath35 and @xmath36 based on the terletsky - margenau - hill distribution which is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the anti - commutator of two operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that , as a quasi - probability , the terletsky - margenau - hill distribution assumes negative values for non - commuting hamiltonians may also translate to @xmath41 which hence is not a probability density function and consequently fails to characterize a proper random variable .",
    "the joint probability @xmath42 of observing the system at an eigenvalue @xmath15 of the hamiltonian @xmath35 by projective measurements at the beginning of the force protocol @xmath11 and the eigenvalue @xmath14 of the hamiltonian @xmath36 at its end is given by @xcite @xmath43 where the projection operators @xmath25 , at times @xmath30 , are defined by the spectral representations of the respective hamiltonians , see ( [ hspec ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that due to the first energy measurement the initial density matrix @xmath19 is projected onto the eigenbasis of the initial hamiltonian @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "all non - diagonal elements of the initial density matrix in the energy eigenbasis are erased by the first measurement .",
    "this will influence the subsequent time evolution unless the initial density matrix and hamiltonian commute with each other .",
    "moreover , this projection excludes the use of correlations between energy eigenstates as a `` resource '' to extract work out of a system by a unitary process , as it has been recently suggested @xcite .    the probability density function ( pdf )",
    "@xmath44 of finding the work @xmath45 by means of two projective energy measurements ( pem ) can be expressed in terms of the joint probability ( [ pmn ] ) as @xcite @xmath46    in a realization of the force - protocol for which the work @xmath45 was obtained the state @xmath47 , immediately after the second energy measurement , is proportional to a linear , positive map @xmath48 acting on the initial density matrix @xmath19 with a proportionality constant inversely proportional to the work pdf @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the post - measurement state can be written as @xmath50 where the so - called operation @xmath48 @xcite is given by @xmath51 if the energies are measured but the work is not registered the system is found in the so - called non - selective post - measurement state @xmath52 , given by @xmath53 leading with ( [ rphir ] ) to @xmath54 this result immediately follows by a two - fold application of the lders - von - neumann rule @xcite . with the requirement of a normalized selective post - measurement state ( [ rphip ] ) , the work pdf follows from the operation acting on the initial system density matrix as @xmath55 hence , the operation @xmath48 can be considered as a complete characterization of the work measurement . it is a linear map on hilbert space operators with finite trace that preserves the positivity , i.e. , @xmath56 implies @xmath57 and is contractive , i.e. , @xmath58 for all @xmath56 .",
    "also more general measurement strategies than the projective one are characterized by operations with these mathematical properties of being linear , positivity preserving and contractive maps on the space of linear hilbert space operators with finite trace .",
    "coming back to projective measurements we finally want to note the crooks relation @xcite .",
    "it connects the pdfs @xmath59 and @xmath60 for a protocol @xmath61 and the time reversed protocol @xmath62@xcite : @xmath63 this requires that the initial density matrices of the forward and the backward processes must have boltzmann weights as diagonal elements in the energy eigenbasis , i.e. @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the degeneracy of the energy @xmath24 and @xmath66 the partition function for @xmath30 .",
    "the free energy difference @xmath67 is defined in terms of the partition functions of the initial states of the forward and the backward processes , @xmath68 .",
    "we note that most often , canonical density matrices are considered as initial states of the forward and backward processes .",
    "we point out , however that for the crooks relation to hold , _ only the diagonal elements _ of these density matrices need to have the form of boltzmann factors whereas the non - diagonal elements may be arbitrary , as long the density matrix is positive .",
    "instead of the projective energy measurements one may employ generalized measurements of energy for determining work . as demonstrated by venkatesh _",
    "@xcite work distributions obtained by means of generalized measurements typically do not satisfy fluctuation relations .",
    "however , for a whole class of generalized energy measurements , in particular for gaussian measurements , modified fluctuation theorems exist for which the modifications are solely determined by the properties of the measurement apparatus and hence are independent of the force protocol @xcite .",
    "we here choose a less formal approach compared to @xcite by adapting von neumann s model @xcite to energy measurements .      in von neumann s model a measurement apparatus , here called the `` pointer '' , is coupled to the system during a short time @xmath69 . within this time",
    "the value of the observable to be measured is transcribed onto the scale of the pointer while ideally @xmath69 is small enough that the unitary dynamics of the system is negligible @xcite .",
    "the information transfer is formally achieved by a unitary operator @xmath70 which when acting on the state of the pointer shifts the pointer position by an amount proportional to the @xmath23 . here , @xmath71 is the momentum operator which is canonically conjugate to the position @xmath72 of the pointer where @xmath73 is the projection operator on the eigenstate @xmath74 with eigenvalue @xmath75 .",

    "the effective interaction strength @xmath79 between system and pointer therefore is given by @xmath80 .",
    "system and pointer are supposed to be uncorrelated before the interaction has taken place .",
    "then the total density matrix is given by the direct product @xmath81 of the system density matrix @xmath82 and the pointer density matrix @xmath83 immediately before the interaction .",
    "the system pointer interaction is followed by a projective measurement of the pointer position @xmath75 .",
    "the state of the system immediately after the measurement can be expressed as @xmath84 where the operation @xmath85 is composed of the interaction and the projective measurement , yielding @xmath86 here , @xmath87 denotes the trace over the hilbert space of the pointer , @xmath88 is the density matrix of the pointer in the position representation , and @xmath89 gives the probability of observing the pointer in the eigenstate @xmath74 .",
    "it is determined by the normalization of the post - measurement state @xmath90 and therefore becomes @xmath91 we now assume that the initial state of the pointer is given by a gaussian density matrix with vanishing averages of position and momentum , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "in order to study this limit in more detail , we consider the characteristic function of work @xcite , which is defined as the fourier transform of the work pdf . hence it becomes @xmath190 where @xmath191 is determined by the fourier transformed pointer density matrix @xmath192 with @xmath193 and @xmath194 the expression ( [ g ] ) with ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ cmnn ] ) is still exact .",

    "before we further discuss the condition of existence and the properties of @xmath206 we note that the result given in the first line of ( [ pilw ] ) can also be directly obtained from the work pdf ( [ pwp ] ) by replacing the first exponential on the right hand side of ( [ pwp ] ) by unity . in this way",
    "all non - diagonal elements contribute equally .",
    "the expression ( [ glu ] ) coincides with the characteristic function of work obtained by two projective energy measurements @xcite only if the initial density matrix @xmath19 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath35 at the beginning of the protocol .",
    "then the two exponents containing @xmath207 can be combined into a single term such that @xmath208 and @xmath209 hold .",
    "in general , though , the inverse fourier transform of @xmath201 leads to a divergent result due to the presence of the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath210 .",
    "only if the symmetrized pointer position momentum cross - correlation vanishes , @xmath211 , @xmath210 is real and @xmath206 becomes a sum of the projective work pdf @xmath44 and further delta - contributions at work values that correspond to the differences @xmath212 between the final energy eigenvalues and the arithmetic averages of all pairs of initial eigenvalues .",
    "hence , for @xmath213 , the inverse fourier transform of the trace expression becomes @xmath214 the integral of @xmath206 over all possible work values is unity as follows from ( [ pilw ] ) with @xmath215 .",
    "because the projective work pdf @xmath44 itself is normalized the integral over the sum expression on the right hand side must vanish .",
    "this implies that either this sum vanishes for all values of @xmath45 or that it assumes both positive and negative values .",

    "one can show that for this to hold the initial density matrix must be stationary , i.e. @xmath217=0 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that in all other cases @xmath206 assumes both positive and negative values and therefore does not qualify as a proper pdf .",
    "the positivity of @xmath218 is only guaranteed by the convolution with a sufficiently broad gaussian which smooths out any negative contributions .    in agreement with the expectation formulated in the beginning of this subsection",

    "figure [ f2 ] demonstrates the transition of the average work from the accurate limit yielding the results of projective energy measurements to the limit of maximally imprecise measurements for different values of the non - diagonal elements of the initial system s density matrix . in the latter limit the approach to the average untouched work ( [ varw ] )",
    "is confirmed .",
    "finally , in figure [ f3 ] the asymptotic work pdf ( [ pilw ] ) is compared with the full result ( [ pw2l ] ) for two different values of the variance @xmath107 . for the smaller one , a negative contribution resulting from negative parts of @xmath206 is visible whereas for the larger one the gaussian factor in ( [ pilw ] ) is sufficiently broad to suppress any negative part . as a result , the limiting distribution coincides fairly well with the exact one , even though with @xmath272 and @xmath273 the inequality ( [ snde ] ) is only marginally satisfied .",
    "we reviewed several attempts to specify work .",
    "in particular , we considered three different setups for which we compared the state of the considered system immediately after the completion of selective and non - selective measurements of work as well as the respective probabilities of finding a particular value of work . in the first scenario ,",
    "work is determined in the standard way by two projective measurements of energy ; in the second scenario , also two energy measurements are performed in each of which the system is coupled to a gaussian pointer state and read out by projective measurements of the pointer state ; the third scenario , proposed by de chiara , roncaglia and paz in @xcite , the result of the first pointer - system interaction encoding the negative initial energy is stored in the pointer until the force protocol is completed .",
    "the final energy is transferred to the same pointer and added to the stored value .",
    "only then the pointer state is read out by a projective measurement .    in all three cases the operations characterizing the selective as well as the non - selective post - measurement states and the distributions of work values are different .",
    "while the projective energy measurements select the elements of the according density matrix that are diagonal with respect to the measured hamiltonians , non - diagonal elements contribute to the post - measurements states generated by both gaussian strategies , however with different weights .",
    "moreover , when considering the work pdfs one finds broadened peaks instead of the sharp lines in the case of projective energy measurements .",
    "the widths of these peaks are governed by an effective measurement strength , @xmath274 , which is determined by the variance of the pointer position @xmath94 , in its initial state and a parameter @xmath80 combining the strength @xmath78 and duration @xmath275 of the interaction between system and pointer . a second variance - like quantity ( @xmath276 )",
    "governs the influence of non - diagonal terms of the initial system density matrix .",
    "these terms not only add to the broadening but also cause shifts of the peaks of the work pdf relative to the possible work values obtained by projective energy measurements .",
    "the two variances are restricted by an inequality which suppresses the influence of non - diagonal elements of the initial density matrix if the broadening of the lines is small . on the other hand",
    "it entails huge broadening if the non - diagonal elements are only little suppressed .",
    "the disjoint parameter regimes of small @xmath202 and large @xmath277 correspond to the limiting cases of accurate and imprecise measurements . in the accurate limit",
    "the work statistics based on projective energy measurements is approached , whereas in the imprecise limit the work statistics is governed by an extremely broad gaussian distribution with an average of the untouched work @xmath17 and width @xmath278 . in this limit ,",
    "the fluctuations are completely determined by the imprecision of the measurement device .",
    "therefore this limit is of minor practical use ; to achieve a reliable estimate of the average untouched work an extremely large number of realizations would be required .    finally , we note that the fluctuation relations of jarzynski and crooks remain valid in its modified form only if the system initially stays in a canonical state .",
    "in contrast to the projective two energy measurement approach it is not sufficient if only the diagonal elements in the initial energy basis are given by boltzmann factors but additional finite non - diagonal elements are present .",
