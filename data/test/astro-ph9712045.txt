    "spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations of sources from the rosat all - sky survey led to the discovery of many lithium - rich stars .",
    "as lithium is destroyed gradually in the deeper layers of the convection zone ( bodenheimer 1965 ) , the detection of the lii6708  line in low - resolution spectra was generally assumed to be a good indicator for the youth of a star .",
    "about 500 stars were classified as low - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , and it was assumed that they were located at the same distance as previously identified classical ttauri stars ( ctts ) in the respective star forming regions ( see neuhuser 1997 for a review ) . as most of these new stars lack infrared excess and strong @xmath2 emission , they were classified as weak - line ttauri stars ( wtts ) , irregardless of whether they are on convective tracks , i.e. being coeval with ctts , or on radiative tracks , i.e. being post - tts .",
    "unlike most ctts , which are associated with dark clouds , the new wtts show a much more wide - spread distribution .    recently , briceo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued that a dispersed population of young ( foreground ) zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) stars with ages up to 100 myr could account for the observed properties of the rosat sources as well .",
    "one can accept a rosat counterpart as pms star only , if it shows li stronger than zams stars of the same spectral type ( spty ) . the li criterion does not work for g - type stars , as g - type zams stars still show the primordial li .",
    "membership of a star to an association can be tested by studying its kinematics , i.e. , its radial velocity rv and proper motion pm .",
    "although rv consistent with membership to an association may be suggestive ( neuhuser et al .",
    "1997 , henceforth n97 ) , it is not conclusive for showing 3d kinematic membership ( frink et al .",
    "1997 , f97 ) .    a better way to determine the evolutionary status is to measure the distance to a star , compute its luminosity , and place it on the h - r diagram . in order to solve the current dispute as to whether the li - rich stellar counterparts to rosat sources are zams or pms stars",
    ", we study the hipparcos data ( esa 1997 ) of 21 li - rich rosat stars , discuss the kinematics , and present their evolutionary status .",

    "their model assumes continuous star formation over @xmath168 yr , but does not include recent star formation in clouds ; they admit that many li - rich rosat counterparts found on or near clouds actually are pms stars .",

    "the @xmath7(li ) distribution of these 15 stars with the other li - rich rosat sources ( figure 2 ) shows that our hipparcos sample  with the exception of maybe two stars  is not biased towards high - li stars .",
    "as only a few of our stars show more li than pleiades of the same spty , but all are pms stars , the li criterion  originally used to classify these stars as pms stars  is conservative .",
    "hence , there can be both pms and zams stars among stars with li as low as zams stars like the pleiades of the same spty , while all stars with more li than zams stars of the same spty are younger and therefore pms stars .",
    "a few of our @xmath173 10 myr old pms stars show li even lower than the pleiades ( figure 2 ) , which may indicate that li depletion is not well understood .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out the possibility that these stars are unresolved binaries , and thus are erroneously placed too high in the h - r diagram ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , brandner & zinnecker 1997 ) .",
    "most of the scorpius and chamaeleon stars are located foreground to the associations , as conjectured by briceo et al . ( 1997 ) . yet , all of the stars are pms stars with ages up to 16 myr . unlike ctts , which are closely associated with dark clouds ,",

    "hd 141277 and hd 283798 are projected onto the lup iii and l1537 clouds , respectively .",

    "four of the chamaeleon stars have rv ( c97 ) consistent with membership , while the rv of hd 81485b , hd 84075 , and hd 92727 indicate that they may well have been ejected towards us , i.e. being run - away tts ( sterzik & durisen 1995 ) .",
