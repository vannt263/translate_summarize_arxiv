    "nonthermal emission is commonly observed among the lowest - mass stars , traced by optical line ( e.g. , ca ii , h i sequence ) , x - ray , uv and radio emission . this emission can be both persistent ( quiescent ) and eruptive , with short - duration flares from m dwarfs occurring at a rate of roughly 3% @xcite . the incidence and strength of quiescent magnetic activity as traced by the h@xmath6 line reaches @xmath380% and @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath04 , respectively , among nearby late - type m dwarfs @xcite , but both metrics decline precipitously for the cooler l and t dwarfs @xcite and sources far from the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "similar declines are seen in x - ray emission , but surprisingly not at radio frequencies . assuming that this nonthermal emission arises from magnetic interaction , the decline with vertical scale height among m dwarfs is likely an age effect , as angular momentum loss over time results in weakened magnetic dynamos .",
    "however , spin - down timescales exceed 5  gyr beyond spectral type m5 @xcite , and many late - type dwarfs are found to be rapid rotators ( p @xmath8 2 - 10  hr ; @xcite ) exhibiting kilogauss magnetic fields at their photospheres @xcite .",
    "hence , the decline in magnetic emission with spectral type must arise from a different effect .",
    "the favored cause is the decoupling of cooler , increasingly neutral photospheres from magnetic structures , which reduces magnetic stresses and the frequency of magnetic reconnection above the ( sub)stellar surface ( e.g. , ) .",
    "deeper reconnection events may continue to power strong flaring bursts observed in a handful of weakly active or inactive late - m and l dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to these trends , a very rare set of low - temperature `` hyperactive '' dwarfs exhibit unusually prodigious and persistent nonthermal emission .",
    "one of the first examples of these to be identified was 2mass  j13153094@xmath02649513 ( hereafter 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 ; @xcite ) , a high proper motion l5e dwarf which has exhibited sustained but variable h@xmath6 emission on no fewer than seven epochs spanning nearly a decade . with @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath04 ,",
    "2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is as active as a mid - type m dwarf , but is 12 orders of magnitude brighter in h@xmath6 than comparably - classified l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in addition , h@xmath9 and na  i d lines have also been observed in emission .",
    "since the photosphere of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is cool and likely to be highly neutral , the origin of its unexpected emission remains a mystery .",
    "neither the kinematics nor spectral characteristics of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 indicate youth , and the absence of mid - infrared excess argues against accretion from a protoplanetary or debris disk @xcite .",
    "other hyperactive dwarfs , such as the l1e dwarf 2mass  j10224821 + 5825453 ( @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath03.5 to @xmath02.7 ; @xcite ) and the t6.5e dwarf 2mass j1237392 + 652615 ( @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath04.6 to @xmath04.2 ; @xcite ; hereafter 2mass  j1237 + 6526 ) also lack evidence of disk accretion and do not appear to be particularly young .",
    "alternative mechanisms , such as acoustic heating , unusually strong magnetic fields , and roche lobe overflow from a substellar companion have been proposed , but none of these scenarios have been validated .    in this article , we report new observations of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 that reveal both continued nonthermal optical line emission in several neutral atomic species , and the presence of a t dwarf companion at a projected separation of 7  au . in section  2 we describe our combined - light optical and near - infrared spectroscopic observations , the latter of which yields preliminary evidence for a brown dwarf companion . in section  3",
    "we describe adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging and spectroscopic observations that confirm the presence of the companion and allow determination of its separation and classification . in section  4",
    "we analyze the observed and inferred physical properties of the components , the latter based on comparison to evolutionary and atmospheric models .",
    "we also perform a coevality test to examine the reliability of these models . in section  5",
    "we discuss how the properties of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 argue for a magnetic origin to its persistent emission , powered by a strong magnetic field retained by a relatively old and massive cool dwarf .",
