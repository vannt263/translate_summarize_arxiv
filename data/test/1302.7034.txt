    "quantum discord is an information - theoretic measure of non - classical correlations , initially proposed by ollivier and zurek  @xcite , which goes beyond entanglement ( separable states can have nonzero discord ) and whose characterization has attracted much attention during the last decade ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review and ref .",
    "@xcite for an operational interpretation ) .",
    "it arises as a difference between the total correlation in a bipartite system ( as measured by the mutual information ) before and after a local measurement is performed over one of the subsystems . from an analytical point of view , the evaluation of the quantum discord is a hard task , even for ( general ) two - qubit states , since an optimization procedure is required for the conditional entropy over all local generalized measurements on one party . in this scenario ,",
    "closed expressions are known only for classes of states  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of extracting analytical solutions for quantum discord led daki , vedral , and brukner to propose a geometric measure of quantum discord @xcite , which quantifies the amount of quantum correlations of a state in terms of its minimal hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of classical states .",
    "the calculation of this alternative measure requires a simpler minimization process , which is realizable analytically for general two - qubit states @xcite as well as for arbitrary bipartite states @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown to exhibit operational significance in specific quantum protocols ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . despite those remarkable features ,",
    "geometric discord is known to be sensitive to the choice of distance measures ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in turn , as recently pointed out  @xcite , the geometric discord as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be regarded as a good measure for the quantumness of correlations , since it may increase under local operations on the unmeasured subsystem . in particular ,",
    "it has explicitly been shown by piani in ref .",
    "@xcite that the simple introduction of a factorized local ancillary state on the unmeasured party changes the geometric discord by a factor given by the lack of purity of the ancilla .",
    "this is in contrast with the entropic quantum discord , which does not suffer this problem . from a technical point of view",
    ", the root of this drawback is the lack of contractivity of geometric discord under trace - preserving quantum channels .",
    "remarkably , this is strongly connected with the norm adopted to define distance in the state space .    most recently , tufarelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have introduced a modified version of geometric discord that is immune to the particular ancilla considered in ref .",
    "however , since this measure is also based on hilbert - schmidt distance , it inherits the noncontractivity problem ( see , e.g. , examples in ref .",
    "a way to circumvent this issue is to employ the trace distance in place of the hilbert - schmidt norm  @xcite . in this direction , we consider the generalization of the geometric discord in terms of schatten @xmath1-norms .",
    "more specifically , we show that the geometric discord as defined by the 1-norm is the only @xmath1-norm geometric discord invariant under the class of channels considered in ref .",
    "furthermore , by restricting the minimization to states in the bell - diagonal form , we analytically evaluate the 1-norm geometric discord for arbitrary bell - diagonal two - qubit states , finding out a very simple expression that is equivalent to the negativity of quantumness  @xcite ( also referred as the minimum entanglement potential  @xcite ) . as an illustration",
    ", we compare our result with the entropic quantum discord and the 2-norm geometric discord , analyzing its monotonicity properties as a function of the correlation functions .",
    "moreover , we also consider the 1-norm geometric discord in the ground state of critical spin chains , discussing its behavior at quantum phase transitions .",

    ", it is defined by the difference @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quantum mutual information , which represents the total correlation in @xmath2  @xcite , and @xmath5 is the measurement - based mutual information , which can be interpreted as the classical correlation in @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "quantum discord vanishes if and only if there exists a non - selective measurement that keeps the density operator invariant .",
    "it is asymmetric with respect to measurements over @xmath12 or @xmath14 , nonnegative , and invariant under local unitary transformations .",
    "moreover , it is equal to the entanglement entropy for pure states .",
    "( color online ) the tetrahedron corresponds to the two - qubit bell - diagonal states , with its vertices ( red points ) representing the four bell states .",

    "the analytical minimization over povms involved in eq .",

    "despite being easier to compute and exhibiting an interesting geometric interpretation , the measure @xmath59 fails as a rigorous quantifier of quantum correlation , since it may increase under local reversible operations on the unmeasured subsystem .",

    "<S> it has recently been pointed out that the geometric quantum discord , as defined by the hilbert - schmidt norm ( @xmath0-norm ) , is not a good measure of quantum correlations , since it may increase under local reversible operations on the unmeasured subsystem . here , we revisit the geometric discord by considering general schatten @xmath1-norms , explicitly showing that the 1-norm is the only @xmath1-norm able to define a consistent quantum correlation measure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by restricting the optimization to the tetrahedron of two - qubit bell - diagonal states , we provide an analytical expression for the 1-norm geometric discord , which turns out to be equivalent to the negativity of quantumness . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the measure by analysing its monotonicity properties and by considering the ground state of quantum spin chains . </S>"
