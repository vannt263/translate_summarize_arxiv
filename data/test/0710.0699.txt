    "until recently , earth was the largest terrestrial object known to exist .",
    "however , five super - earth planets ( a class defined as having a mass between 1 - 10 @xmath1- earth - masses ) have been detected in the last few years @xcite .",
    "the five planets have masses in the 5 - 10 @xmath1 range , but we do not have information on their sizes and can not be sure if these are really rocky terrestrial planets . however , their discovery provides some evidence that super - earths might be common and it is only a matter of chance that our solar system has none",
    ". some of these planets might be in the habitable zone , where the radiation from the star allows for the presence of liquid water , but only their thermal and chemical evolution will determine if they are , in fact , habitable . in turn ,",
    "their thermal evolution and surface conditions depend on and affect their tectonic regime . currently , earth is the only planet where plate tectonics is active .",
    "furthermore , this mode of convection has dominated our planet s geological history , is associated with geochemical cycles and thus , has been proposed as a required mechanism for life on earth @xcite . here",
    "we address whether or not super - earths are likely to have plate tectonics or be in a stagnant lid convection like mercury and mars .",
    "plate tectonics is a complicated process that primarily requires lithospheric failure , deformation and subduction . for this",
    ", convective stresses of the system have to be large enough to overcome lithospheric resistance to deformation and the plate has to reach negative buoyancy to drive subduction .",
    "the convective stresses are a function of the underlying flow field and the viscosity of the fluid , whereas the plate s strength depends on the elastic thickness and mechanical properties .",
    "our contribution is based on identifying how the lithospheric or plate thickness ( @xmath2 ) and convective stresses ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) depend on planetary mass ( m ) .",
    "we use detailed models of the internal structure of massive terrestrial planets @xcite and parameterized convection models to show that the condition for deformation and subsequent subduction is easily met by planets more massive than earth . a second condition necessary for subduction",
    "is that the plate cools enough to develop negative buoyancy at subduction zones @xcite .",
    "it is unclear as to how important this requirement is with recent elaborated petrological models @xcite suggesting that on earth , the plate s mean density is never larger than the underlying mantle s .",
    "nontheless , we discuss the conditions for the development of negative buoyancy on super - earths .",
    "the thickness of the lithosphere or boundary layer ( @xmath2 ) depends on the rayleigh number @xmath5 )  a parameter governing convection . a variety of models of boundary layer convection @xcite lead to @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the critical rayleigh number above which a fluid starts convecting .",
    "this results in @xmath2 being independent of the depth @xmath9 of the convecting layer .",
    "the exponential relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath10 has been extensively addressed as different flow details , geometries , turbulence , and other complicating effects are taken into account .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested that @xmath11 where viscous dissipation within the bending subducting slab is larger than the dissipation within the shearing mantle , which is the case for thick strong plates @xcite .",
    "however , since we show below that the plates for super - earths are thin , the case where @xmath11 can be ruled out .",
    "other values of @xmath12 will not change the qualitative results obtained here .",
    "the deviatoric horizontal normal stress ( @xmath4 ) responsible for causing failure on the plate is ( to first order ) balanced by the shear stress ( @xmath3 ) applied over the base of the plate .",
    "thus , by a simple force balance @xmath13 @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the plate length , calculated from the time it takes for the plate to cool conductively and grow to a thickness @xmath2 , @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the convective velocity .",
    "the shear stress depends on the viscosity @xmath19 and the velocity field of the fluid . in the most simple case",
    "this dependence will be linear so that the stress under the plate is @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the faster the flow , the larger the stress . in general",
    "these are competing effects : viscosity decreases while velocities increase with higher temperatures ( t ) .",
    "the relationship for velocity is @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "a super - earth can be expected to have larger velocities due to larger rayleigh numbers .",
    "thus , we need to investigate the extent to which the viscosity effect reduces the stress to predict whether or not plate failure will occur .",
    "we do so by considering two cases for viscosity : an isoviscous case ( @xmath24pa@xmath25s  earth s nominal value ) , and a t dependent viscosity case ( @xmath26  @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate the internal structure of terrestrial planets with masses in the range of @xmath27 @xcite and determine the mantle thickness , density and gravity of each planet .",
    "we find that a power law relationship can adequately express the dependence of these parameters on m. for planetary mantles , the rayleigh number depends on the mantle density @xmath28 , gravity @xmath29 , mantle thickness @xmath30 and heat flux ( @xmath31 ) , which all depend on the mass of the planet .",
    "@xmath10 also depends on material properties : thermal expansivity ( @xmath32 ) , thermal diffusivity ( @xmath33 ) , thermal conductivity ( @xmath34 ) and viscosity ( @xmath35 . the latter is a strong function of t. therefore the rayleigh number @xmath36 , depends indirectly on m and t. it increases for super - earths as the size of their mantle and interior heat increases . to account for the heat flux as a function of m we scale radioactive heat production and",
    "indirectly consider secular cooling .",
    "it is straightforward to scale the radioactive production with m for similar bulk compositions .",
    "secular cooling , on the other hand , can only be completely assessed by considering the full thermal evolution .",
    "more massive planets would have larger initial gravitational energy budgets to dissipate over time ; we assume for simplicity that the heat to be lost to secular cooling is proportional to m. convective velocities also scale roughly with m ( @xmath37 see table 1 ) , so that the proportional rate of cooling should be roughly independent of m. even though the relative contributions of radioactive heating and secular cooling to the total heat flow will depend on the evolution of the planet , we will assume that heat flow scales proportionately with m , especially because we expect the radioactive production to be dominant .",
    "the internal structure model allows us to calculate ra , @xmath2 and t beneath the plate for planets between 1 - 10 @xmath1 .",
    "convergence of these parameters determines the structure and final radius of each super - earth planet .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of plate thickness ( blue ) and horizontal normal stress ( green ) as a function of m for the t - dependent - viscosity case and earth - like radioactive heat sources ( solid ) .",
    "an additional case with reduced heat sources ( dashed ) is discussed below .",
    "the trends between these two scenarios and scaling exponents are similar , although their @xmath38 values are different .",
    "as expected , the plate thickness decreases as the m of the planet increases .",
    "this is because a more vigorous convective interior can transport heat more efficiently to the surface and sustain a higher surface heat flux .",
    "in addition , shear stress underneath the plate increases proportionately with m ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and thus , the deviatoric horizontal normal stress also increases .",
    "this means that the viscosity reduction effect on stress is very small compared to the velocity effect .",
    "this is the case because the drop in t within the plate and hence local viscosity are nearly independent of m as indicated by our calculations for the more realistic t - dependent - viscosity case ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for similar surface temperature , the increase in temperature at the base of the lithosphere between earth and a super - earth differs at most by only 5% .",
    "we think the reason for this surprising result is a very efficient negative feedback induced by viscosity .",
    "if t increases , the viscosity decreases and heat flux increases , cooling the planet and reducing t. we ignore pressure ( p ) effects on viscosity because we expect them to be small under thin plates and because we find that p at the base of the plate is roughly the same for all super - earths .",
    "figure 2 shows the dependence of all the relevant convective parameters with planetary mass normalized to the earth s values for the t - dependent case .",
    "the results can be adequately fitted to a power law such as @xmath39 where the exponent @xmath40 shows the dependence on m. in a vigorously convective interior ( high @xmath10 ) the velocities are expected to be large and this is evident in fig .",
    "the relative size of the convection cells measured as the length of the plate with respect to its radius ( @xmath41 ) increases slightly , from a 0.29 for a @xmath38 planet to a 0.30 ratio for a @xmath42 planet .",
    "the maximum plate age , related to the convective overturn , in a super - earth is much less ( see table 1 for @xmath43 ) .",
    "in addition to a bulk silicate earth composition for radiactive sources , we also consider planets with no @xmath44 content . as a result of potassium s volatile nature ,",
    "earth is depleted in this element @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible for other planets to also have non - chondritic k concentrations .",
    "u / o and th / o ratios can be expected to be fairly constant for planets forming around stars with a relatively recent supernova event ( within 10 gy ) .",
    "k contributes less than 1/3 of total heat from radioactive sources at the present time on earth . within this context",
    ", we consider a pesimistic scenario for a super - earth with only 1/3 of its chondritic heat flow ( @xmath45 ) and no secular cooling contribution .",
    "this end - member case ( @xmath46 ) shows comparatively thicker plates ( fig .",
    "1 ) , with 88 km versus 43 km in thickness for a @xmath38 planet . additionally , the driving force is in the order of 1 - 6 mpa which is lower than the earth s value of @xmath4710 mpa .",
    "this is an extreme case where subduction would be difficult but still possible for the most massive super - earths if other factors , such as the presence of hydrated minerals is invoked to reduce the strength of the plate . for each planetary mass",
    ", there is a threshold in heat flow below which the convective driving force would not be sufficient to maintain subduction and plate tectonics would cease .",
    "nontheless , most of the super - earths that will be detected in the next few years will likely fall in a regime above the @xmath46 scenario .      on earth ,",
    "the oceanic lithosphere is comprised of 7 km of basaltic crust ( chemically buoyant ) , overlaying lithospheric mantle .",
    "we perform a simple buoyancy calculation at subduction ages by considering the thermal contraction from the ridge .",
    "we determine maximum crustal thicknesses that still allow the lithospheric mean density to be larger than the underlying mantle s .",
    "we find this value to be 13% the plate thickness at subduction zones ( twice the average thickness - @xmath2 ) .",
    "the crustal thickness depends on the extent of melting under ridges which depends on the p and t conditions .",
    "as shown above , t at ridges and under plates varies little with m , so that with larger gravity values , melting occurs at shallower depths in super - earths .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the crust thins with increasing planetary m , and while it becomes a larger component of the also thinning boundary layers , its thickness stays below the threshold allowing negative buoyancy .",
    "this effect stands in contrast to the young earth that had a higher potential t but same p profile @xcite . to precisely assess the density of the plate detailed petrological models like those of @xcite and @xcite are needed .",
    "it is important to point out that their models do not predict negative buoyancy on earth when the plate s density is compared to sublithospheric density , arguing that perhaps this condition is not critical for the initiation of subduction .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that in compressive regions , the cold plate can thicken to a point that negative buoyancy is inevitable and subduction follows . if negative buoyancy is indeed a necessary condition ,",
    "our simple calculations show that super - earths can satisfy it .",
    "in summary , convection is more vigourous in massive terrestrial planets , making their lithospheres thinner and therefore reducing lithospheric strength .",
    "furthermore , they achieve larger stresses owing primarily to larger velocities and therefore can more easily overcome the lithospheric resistance to deformation .",
    "plates may reach negative buoyancy on super - earths despite their relative younger ages .",
    "this scenario is suitable for the failure of the plate and subsequent subduction , which is a necessary step for plate tectonics . given that earth s convective state leads to plate tectonics , the more favorable conditions experienced by super - earths will inevitably lead to plate tectonics .",
    "furthermore , planets of similar mass should have the same potential to exhibit plate tectonics .",
    "conversely , this physics can help explain why small planets like mars , mercury and the moon do not exhibit plate tectonics .",
    "venus is only slightly smaller than earth and does not exhibit plate tectonics , although some authors @xcite have suggested it may have in the past .",
    "this observation indicates that the @xmath471 earth - mass case falls within a zone of transition between ` hard ' stagnant lid and mobile plate regimes . in this case , characteristics other than m may be important to the dynamics of the lithosphere .",
    "for example , the high surface temperature of venus might lead to a weak , highly deformable boundary layer that would not support the coherent plate - like behaviour that characterizes oceanic plates on earth .",
    "moreover , plate strength is relatively large compared to the mantle driving force in the one earth - mass case ; yield stresses are on the order of 1 - 5 gpa for olivine ( the representative upper mantle mineral ) @xcite , whereas our calculations , in agreement with more detailed models @xcite , suggest an underlying driving force of only 10 mpa . since slip can occur on pre - existing faults at stress values of a few mpa , the existence of plate tectonics in the one earth - mass regime may thus depend crucially on the conditions required to initiate subduction .",
    "the presence of water is one possible mechanism to reduce the yield strength of a plate and friction on faults .",
    "experiments show that water reduces the yield strength of olivine by 62% when raising the temperature from 25 to 400@xmath48c at 10 gpa , compared to a drop of 39% in dry olivine @xcite .",
    "hence , the hydration level of venus mantle , which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than on earth @xcite , may make it very difficult for convective forces within this planet to overcome plate resistance .    for larger planets , super - earths",
    ", these issues become less relevant .",
    "a wet super - earth will clearly have enough driving force to sustain subduction .",
    "but , more importantly , the consequences for initiating subduction associated with the hydration of a one earth - mass planet ( i.e. , a reduction of the yield strength by half ) would be similar to a doubling of the mass of the planet ( fig .",
    "2 ) . that is to say , both scenarios would be as likely to initiate and maintain subduction .",
    "the difference between a super - earth with active plate tectonics and one with stagnant lid is in the access of upper mantle material and gasses to the atmosphere .",
    "the first case allows several global geochemical cycles to operate , like the co@xmath49 and so@xmath49 ones .",
    "for example , cases in our solar system comprise : earth with a co@xmath49 cycle and possibly early mars with a so@xmath49 cycle @xcite .",
    "earth has had stable modest levels of atmospheric co@xmath49 ( between 160 - 7000 ppm ",
    "@xcite ) in the last 0.5 gy whereas venus levels stand today at 96% .",
    "a planet with plate tectonism and a carbonate rock reservoir has an efficient built - in cycle that stabilizes climate at temperatures within the liquid water regime @xcite .",
    "a super - earth that has plate tectonics and weathering capabilities can be expected to have co@xmath49 atmospheric concentrations that would yield temperatures around liquid water .",
    "therefore , evidence against the presence of plate tectonics on an exoplanet would be the detection of high values of co@xmath49 for the age of the star , type of star and orbital distance .",
    "an so@xmath49 based atmosphere is also possible and the same reasoning would apply , since the sulfur cycle operates analogously to the carbon cycle . but obviously , more theoretical research is necessary to model the details and predict the right observable signatures .    in conclusion , we show here that as mass increases , the process of subduction , and hence plate tectonics , becomes easier .",
    "therefore , massive super - earths will very likely exhibit plate tectonics . in the future with tpf by nasa and darwin by esa it might be possible to use spectroscopy to identify atmospheric signatures suggesting plate tectonism on these objects .",
    "this class of planets offers the possibility of finding earth analogs and , in particular , make attractive targets in the search for habitable planets .",
