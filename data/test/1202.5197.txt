    "in this article we study the allen - cahn / cahn - hilliard model ( ac - ch model for short ) , which combines and extends two famous diffuse interface models : the allen - cahn equation and the cahn - hilliard equation .",

    "the allen - cahn equation is a second order partial differential equation of ginzburg - landau type for an _ unconserved _ order - parameter @xmath3 and thus can be used to model segregation and precipitation in solids , or other more general situations where a reordering of the crystal lattice occurs .",
    "conversely , the cahn - hilliard equation is a fourth - order partial differential equation for a _ conserved _ order parameter @xmath4 striving to model phase change phenomena where one physical quantity like the volume of the phases is preserved . throughout the paper we set @xmath5 as this plays a special role .",

    "our definition of the extended model does not require any special assumptions ( except regarding the regularity ) on the stored energy functional @xmath8 .",

    "we show that assumption  ( @xmath9 ) is satisfied in the following cases :    * materials which follow the linear theory of elasticity developed by eshelby @xcite in the context of elastic inclusions and inhomogeneities ( see a remark after assumption  ( @xmath9 ) ) ; * materials in @xmath6 which are well - described by a geometrically linear theory of elasticity ( theorem  [ thmcor1 ] , for @xmath10 , cf .",

    "<S> we present an extension of the allen - cahn / cahn - hilliard system which incorporates a geometrically linear ansatz for the elastic energy of the precipitates . </S>",
    "<S> the model contains both the elastic allen - cahn system and the elastic cahn - hilliard system as special cases and accounts for the microstructures on the microscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the existence of weak solutions to the new model for a general class of energy functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we then give several examples of functionals that belong to this class . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the energy of geometrically linear elastic materials for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we show this for @xmath1 in the setting of scalar - valued deformations , which corresponds to the case of anti - plane shear . </S>",
    "<S> all this is based on explicit formulas for relaxed energy functionals newly derived in this article for @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> we can also prove uniqueness of the weak solutions . </S>"
