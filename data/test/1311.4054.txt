    "it is well known that light has not only energy but also linear and angular momenta that can be transferred to atoms , molecules , and material particles .",
    "radiation pressure due to the momentum flux in a light beam tends to push illuminated objects along the direction of propagation .",
    "the intensity - gradient force tends to draw small objects toward extrema of the intensity . in single - beam optical traps known as optical tweezer ,",
    "the axial intensity gradient is deep enough that the intensity - gradient force exceeds radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the tightly focused light beam of an optical tweezer can therefore draw particles against the light propagation direction .",
    "like the optical tweezer technique @xcite , the techniques of optical solenoid beams @xcite and optical conveyor belts @xcite also require gradient forces to move small objects back and forth along the beam axis .",
    "recent studies have shown theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite that small particles can be pulled by so - called tractor light beams against the photon stream even when the beam intensity is uniform along the propagation axis . unlike other optical techniques of micro - object manipulation @xcite , the pulling of particles against the propagation direction of a tractor beam originates from a non - conservative optical backward pulling force .",
    "such a pulling force occurs when the projection of the total incident photon momentum along the propagation direction is small and the forward scattering is dominant @xcite .",
    "several types of tractor beams have been proposed and studied .",
    "they include interfering bessel beams @xcite , interfering plane waves @xcite , or a single bessel beam with a semi - apex angle close to @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". a disadvantage of the bessel - based technique is that , as with a plane wave , a true bessel beam can not be created because it is unbounded and would require an infinite amount of energy .",
    "approximations to bessel beams are made in practice by focusing a gaussian beam with an axicon lens to generate a bessel - gauss beam .",
    "such beams exist only in a spatially limited volume dictated by optical elements .",
    "consequently , the lengths of approximate versions of bessel beams are short ( typically less than 10  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "similarly , the lengths of tractor beams created by interfering gaussian beams , which are approximations to plane waves in practice , are also limited @xcite .    due to wide applications of near - field optical microscopy and spectroscopy , especially in biology , medicine , materials engineering , and information technology ,",

    "the radiation force exerted on small spherical particles in an evanescent field near a dielectric interface has been studied @xcite .",
    "an interesting scheme for generating an evanescent - wave optical field is to use an optical fiber that is tapered to a diameter comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "in such a thin fiber , called a nanofiber , the guided field penetrates an appreciable distance into the surrounding medium and appears as an evanescent wave carrying a significant fraction of the propagating power and having a complex polarization pattern @xcite .",

    "the manifestation of such a broadening is related to the reduction of the @xmath152 factor of the mie resonances .",
    "another favorable factor for the azimuthal force @xmath121 to be negative in a broad interval of @xmath141 is that the orbital azimuthal poynting vector part @xmath71 , which determines the radiation pressure on a dipolar particle in the @xmath93 direction , is very small in a broad range of the distance @xmath76 [ see the dashed green line in fig .  [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "comparison between the red , green , blue , and cyan lines of figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] shows that variations in the fiber radius affect the components of the force in a complicated way .",
    "indeed , we observe that , when the fiber radius increases , the force components may either reduce or increase , depending on the region of parameters .",
    "( a ) , @xmath121 ( b ) , and @xmath122 ( c ) of the force of the guided light as functions of the size parameter @xmath141 of the particle in the case where the particle - material refractive index is @xmath153 and the radius of the nanofiber is @xmath49 nm .",
    "other parameters are the same as those for fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . ]     except for the fiber radius @xmath154 nm . ]    in order to see the effects of the refractive index @xmath79 of the material of the particle on the force , we perform numerical calculations for the case where @xmath153 . in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , we plot the components of the force from the guided light field of a nanofiber with the fiber radius of 250 nm and 500 nm , respectively .",
    "we observe from both figures the oscillatory behavior that is typical in the scattering from mie particles @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows that , in the case of the fiber radius of 250 nm , the azimuthal force @xmath121 is negative in a broad interval of the particle size parameter @xmath141 .",
    "meanwhile , in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where the fiber radius is 500 nm , the azimuthal force @xmath121 is negative in a smaller ( but still significant ) interval of @xmath141 . outside this interval ,",
    "the sign of @xmath121 sequentially changes from negative to positive and vice versa .",
    "comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] shows that the oscillations and magnitudes of the dependencies of the force components on the particle size parameter @xmath141 do not depend much on the fiber radius @xmath2 .",
    "this stems from the fact that the mie resonances are not modified significantly by the change of the fiber radius .",
    "we recognize that multiple backscattering between the particle and the fiber surface on the force was omitted in our treatment .",
    "we note that the effect of multiple reflections between a particle and a dielectric surface has been studied in the framework of a ray - optic model for evanescent - wave scattering @xcite .",
    "rigorous multiple scattering numerical methods have been developed @xcite . in the context of the experimental demonstration of a tractor beam ,",
    "the influence of the scattered field reflected from a mirror back towards the particle has also been investigated @xcite . according to the above mentioned studies , the effect of multiple scattering is not serious even for a particle located on the surface if the values of the size parameters are moderate .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that , for a polystyrene particle with a diameter of 7 @xmath1 m in alcohol , located at a very small separation distance ( about 1 nm ) from a mgf@xmath155 film , more than 98% of the scattered energy is due to the initial contact of the evanescent wave @xcite . for smaller particles , such as those considered in the present paper , the effect of multiple scattering on the force",
    "is expected to be very small .",
    "the numerical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite for the experimental realization of a tractor beam have also confirmed that the reflection of the scattered field by a mirror does not significantly alter the resulting optical force .",
    "therefore , we believe that the effect of multiple scattering is not important in our present problem , where moderate values of the size parameters were used in calculations .    in order to observe the occurrence of a negative azimuthal force experimentally ,",
    "it is desirable to minimize the motion of the particle along the fiber axis .",
    "this can be done by using a standing - wave scheme instead of the running - wave configuration studied in this paper .",
    "we have calculated the force in the case of a pair of counterpropagating guided fields with the same quasicircular polarization .",
    "we have found for this scheme that a negative azimuthal force can also occur while the particle experiences an axial force toward the positions of either quasi - antinodes or quasi - nodes of the standing - wave structure depending on the particle size parameter .",
    "we have studied the poynting vector of a quasicircularly polarized guided light field of a nanofiber , and have calculated the force of the field on a dielectric spherical particle outside the nanofiber .",
    "we have shown that the orbital parts of the axial and azimuthal components of the poynting vector are always positive while the spin parts can be either positive or negative .",
    "the presence of the spin part of the axial poynting vector component is related to the presence of the longitudinal component of the guided light field .",
    "it is the source of the negative axial poynting vector obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for high - contrast optical nanofibers .",
    "we have found that , when the size parameter of the particle is appropriate , the azimuthal component of the force is directed oppositely to the circulation direction of the energy flow around the nanofiber .",
    "the occurrence of such a negative azimuthal force indicates the occurrence of a negative torque upon the particle , depending on the size of the particle .",
    "a negative azimuthal force occurs when the incident quasicircularly polarized guided field is scattered dominantly in the positive direction of the azimuthal energy flow . unlike the case of the azimuthal direction ,",
    "a negative force along the axial direction could not be obtained in the range of the parameters we considered .",
    "the reason is that the incident photons have a significant orbital momentum aligned along the axial direction .",
