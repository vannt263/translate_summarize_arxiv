    ", galex presents a uniform and complete picture of galaxy evolution in the uv domain since z@xmath10 . in this paper",
    ", we carried out galaxy number counts in the two galex bands : the fuv ( 1530 ) and the nuv ( 2310 ) .",
    "we have the following science goals : ( 1 ) constraining the evolution models of uv galaxies ; ( 2 ) evaluating the cosmic variance of uv galaxies ; ( 3 ) estimating the contribution from galaxies to the cosmic background radiation in the two uv bands ; ( 4 ) providing the calibrations for the uv luminosity functions .",
    "cm    -0.5 cm    three data sets taken from the galex database were analyzed in this work , yielding 17174 fuv galaxies and 41512 nuv galaxies in the final samples for the counts ( table  1 ) .",

    "the source lists are products of the galex pipeline , which uses a combination of the programs sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and poissonbg , a new program written for galex data , to detect and obtain photometry for sources in galex images .",
    "poissonbg determines a background map for each galex image with a method very similar to that used in sextractor itself except that the background is estimated using the mean and counts due to sources are iteratively clipped out using the full poisson distribution , rather than assuming gaussian statistics which is not appropriate for low counts rate found commonly in galex images .",
    "poissonbg also creates a detection threshold map for a user - specified probability using the background image and the full poisson distribution .",
    "the original image is divided by the detection threshold map and given as the detection image to sextractor while the sextractor measurements are done on the background - subtracted image .",
    "the galex magnitude is taken from the mag@xmath13 of the sextractor .",
    "key sextractor / poissonbg parameters used by the pipeline are listed in table a1 ( electronic table ) .",

    "was found in the later stage of data analysis , resulting from a small ( @xmath15 ) positive bias of our present sky background estimator .",
    "this was corrected empirically according to results of the artificial source simulations ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the minimum distance among the 3 dis fields is 0.86 deg . in order to avoid source duplication ,",
