    "animal groups often behave as if they have a single mind , displaying remarkable self - organized behavior . at one extreme ,",
    "the individuals seem to need little information transfer ( e.g. fish schools ) , while at the other end the information exchange occurs in highly integrated ways through long - term associations among the individuals ( e.g. honeybee hives and human communities ) .",
    "controlling such an organized behavior in groups of artificial objects , including autonomous underwater vehicles ( leonard et al . , 2006 ) and groups of autonomous agents ( jadbabaie et al . , 2003 ) , has received extensive attention in contemporary control theory .",
    "challenges in both natural and engineering settings involve understanding which patterns emerge from the interaction among individual agents .",
    "select laboratory experiments have shed some light on the schooling mechanism ( hunter , 1966 ; van olst and hunter , 1970 ; partridge and pitcher , 1979 , 1980 ; pitcher et al . , 1976 ) .",
    "it still remains unclear , however , how the individual - level behavior and group - level ( `` macroscopic '' , or coarse - grained ) patterns are related .",
    "more precise experiments using three - dimensional tracking of every individual in a population should lead to better understanding of this linkage .",
    "an ultimate experimental study with precise control of every relevant detail may not be possible , yet appropriate mathematical models would provide a venue to establish behavioral cause , as one can consider different hypothetical individual - level interaction rules selectively ( see e.g. , flierl et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "several different individual - based models have been proposed , which reproduce certain types of collective behavior in animal groups ( e.g. , see aoki , 1982 ; reynolds , 1987 ; deneubourg and goss , 1989 ) .",

    "a long - range interaction has been incorporated into the spp model ( mikhailov and zanette , 1999 ) , and continuum , `` hydrodynamic '' versions of this model have been introduced ( toner and tu , 1995 , 1998 ; topaz et al . , 2006 )",
    ". recently , couzin et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2005 ) have introduced a model to provide insights into the mechanism of decision making in biological systems , which reproduces many important observations made in the field , and provides new insights into these phenomena . a review for various models can be found in parrish et al .",

    "these shed light on the role of leadership and imitation , and produce a number of surprising results , such as the influence that a few `` informed '' individuals can have on large collectives .",
    "what is needed now are efforts to simplify those models , and to show especially what properties of the microscopic simulators are essential to explain that behavior .",
    "for some models , closure schemes are available ( flierl et al . , 1999 ) ; but more generally , though we may suspect that closures exist , we can not derive explicit expressions for them . in such circumstances",
    ", we need methods such as those used in this paper ; we perform the coarse - grained dynamical analysis by circumventing the derivation of governing equations , using an equation - free computational approach ( theodoropoulos et al . , 2000 ;",
    "kevrekidis et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "a particular goal is to understand how much of the specific spatial detail is fundamental to the behavior . but",
    "turning to the kuramoto - type approximation , where the interaction is assumed to be global , we deliberately ignore local effects . to the extent that the models fail to explain observed types of behavior",
    ", we will need to turn next to more detailed models .",
    "most of previously proposed models concern populations of _ homogeneous _ ( or indistinguishable ) individuals .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical analysis in the literature is often limited to a small subset of the entire parameter space , and a systematic classification of possible global dynamics remains elusive . in the current paper",
    ", we study the _ coarse - grained _ alignment dynamics of individual - based animal group models .",
    "the measurement of the mean angular deviation of fish schools ( e.g. clupeids and scombroids ; see atz , 1953 ; hunter 1966 ) showed that it varies continuously from no alignment to practically perfect alignment .",
    "we account for this continuous change by heterogeneity ( `` quenched noise '' ; characterized by parameters of random variables drawn from a prescribed distribution function ) and the coupling strength .",
    "our approach is flexible in that the heterogeneity can be introduced in various places in the model , and the way we analyze different heterogeneity cases does not require any significant modification .",

    "we briefly discuss a `` minimal '' model proposed by nabet et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which we extend in our study .",
    "it concerns the alignment dynamics of a homogeneous population of _ indistinguishable _ @xmath0 individuals with two subgroups of informed individuals ( `` leaders '' ) with populations @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively and @xmath3 uninformed individuals ( `` followers '' ) , where @xmath4 : @xmath5 here @xmath6 characterizes the average direction of the individuals in each of the two informed subgroups for @xmath7 and the average direction of the uninformed individuals for @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the corresponding informed , preferred direction ( @xmath10 can be set to zero without loss of generality ) and @xmath11 is the coupling strength .",
    "this minimal model corresponds to the reduced system of the following system of @xmath0 individuals ( nabet et al . , 2006 ) :",
    "@xmath12 where the angle @xmath13 characterizes the direction in which the @xmath14th individual is heading ( we will refer to it as `` orientation '' ) . the average direction @xmath6 is defined as the angle of the average of the phasors ( when each individual s dynamical state is considered as a phasor of unit radius and a phase angle ) of the individuals in the @xmath15th subgroup ; @xmath16 is the magnitude of the average of the phasors .",
    "formally , this is written as @xmath17 the large population model in eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) has a separation of time scales .",
    "individuals within each subgroup synchronize quickly , i.e. , @xmath16 quickly converges to 1 .",
    "the slow dynamics are described by the reduced system ( eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) ) where the variables @xmath6 characterize the _ lumped behavior _ of each of the three subgroups .",
    "it is assumed that the alignment ( orientational ) dynamics are independent of the translational counterpart ( sepulchre et al . ,",
    "2005 ) ; hence , the dynamical state of an individual can be characterized by its orientation .",
    "the functional form for mutual interaction is borrowed from the well - known kuramoto model ( kuramoto , 1984 ) , a prototypical model for coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "this simplified global interaction model is consistent with an observation that the strongest correlations are observed between the ( speed and ) direction of the individual and the average ( speed and ) direction of the entire school ( partridge , 1982 ) : in the mean - field form of the kuramoto model , the interaction term can be rewritten as @xmath18 where @xmath19 in this alternate expression , the dependence on the difference between the individual direction and the average direction stands out explicitly . in the absence of coupling ( @xmath20 ) , each leader eventually heads for its preferred direction .",
    "nontrivial dynamical behavior for the minimal model ( eq .  ( [ reduced ] ) ) are studied in nabet et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; bifurcations are analyzed for the global phase space in the case @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the aforementioned models concern populations of _ homogeneous _ subgroups , where the individuals in each subgroup quickly synchronize , nearly perfectly ( @xmath23 ) , during the initial transients ( nabet et al . , 2006 ) . in the more general case ,",
    "the mean angular deviation of fish schools is finite ( atz , 1953 ; hunter , 1966 ) , which is not captured in this `` minimal '' model .",
    "we extend the model to account for the distribution of directions within schools , assuming it arises from the _ heterogeneity _ among the group members .",
    "we introduce the heterogeneity in the following two ways : + ( i ) _ two leaders and many heterogeneous followers  _",
    "first we consider the cases when the population consist of two leaders ( which possibly represent lumped behavior of groups of homogeneous leaders ) and @xmath24 followers :      where the heterogeneity is accounted for through the tendency to deviate from the average direction , characterized by @xmath26 , an i.i.d .",

    "+ ( ii ) _ two groups of heterogeneous leaders  _ secondly , we consider two groups of heterogeneous leaders without any followers , focusing only on the dynamics among leaders .",
