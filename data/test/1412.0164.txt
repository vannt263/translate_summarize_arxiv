    ", we may consider a formal symmetry in the sense that under the transformation @xmath4 the new equations have @xmath5 as a solution whenever @xmath6 solves . in this context , the pt - symmetry @xcite can be referred to as pt - reversibility .",
    "equations without nonlinearity with time - independent @xmath7 were derived in @xcite as a finite dimensional reduction of mode guiding optical systems with gain and loss regimes @xcite .",
    "the following successful experiments @xcite have stimulated extensive studies on the pt systems , including the interplay between the symmetry and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "later , equations similar to were also derived @xcite modeling bose - einstein condensates with pt - symmetric double - well potentials @xcite .",
    "the study of the above systems with equal and constant gain and loss were motivated by a relatively recent postulate in quantum physics that hamiltonian operators do not have to be self - adjoint ( hermitian ) for the potential physical relevance ; non - hermitian operators only need to respect parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetries and the spectrum of the operators can be real if the strength of the anti - hermitian part , i.e.  @xmath8 in , does not exceed a critical value @xcite . above the critical value , the systems are said to be in the pt - broken phase regime .",
    "note that system with constant @xmath9 was firstly proposed and studied in @xcite .",
    "equation was a particular case of a notably integrable dimer , where it was shown that the general system could be reduced to a first - order differential equation with polynomial nonlinearity and possesses blow - up solutions @xcite .",
    "the solution dynamics of in that case has been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , with a gain and loss parameter that is periodically a function of time was considered in @xcite . by deriving an averaged equation , the rapid modulation in time of the gain and loss profile",
    "was shown to provide a controllable expansion of the region of exact pt - symmetry , depending on the strength and frequency of the imposed modulation . in the presence of dispersion along the direction perpendicular to the propagation axis ,",
    "rapidly modulated gain and loss was shown to stabilize bright solitons @xcite .",
    "the same system featuring a `` supersymmetry '' when the gain and loss are equal to the inter - core coupling admits a variety of exact solutions ( we focus on solitons ) , which are subject to a specific subexponential instability @xcite .",
    "however , the application of the `` management '' in the form of periodic simultaneous switch of the sign of the gain , loss , and inter - core coupling , effectively stabilizes solitons , without destroying the supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "a significant broadening of the quasienergy spectrum , leading to a hyperballistic transport regime , due to a time - periodic modulation has also been reported in @xcite .",
    "when the damping and gain factor varies stochastically in time , it was shown in @xcite that the statistically averaged intensity of the field grows . a different , but similar dimer to involving a parametric ( ac ) forcing through periodic modulation of the coupling coefficient of the two degrees of freedom was considered recently in @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the combination of the forcing and pt - symmetric potential exhibits dynamical charts featuring tongues of parametric instability , whose shape has some significant differences from that predicted by the classical theory of the parametric resonance in conservative systems .    in this work ,",
    "we consider with time - varying @xmath7 whose modulation period is @xmath10 .",
    "using melnikov type analysis and topological degree arguments , we prove and derive conditions for the existence of periodic ( libration ) , shift periodic ( rotation ) , and chaotic solutions in the system .",
    "note that the existence of bounded rotation modes for the phase - difference of the dimer wavefunctions is a novel and interesting feature as they cease to exist in the time - independent @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we also derive an approximate threshold for pt - broken phase corresponding to the disappearance of bounded solutions .",

    "we reduce the governing equation into @xmath11 which becomes the main object which we study in this paper . in section [ bif ]",

    "then an averaging - like result concerning the existence of periodic solutions is proved when all terms of are small ( see ) .",
    "we return back to general in section [ for ] and use topological degree arguments for showing odd - periodic , shift - periodic and anti - periodic solutions under certain symmetric properties of . in section [ appl ] , we apply results of sections [ bif ] and [ for ] to . in section [ numer ]",
