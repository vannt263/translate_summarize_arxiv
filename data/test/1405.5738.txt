    "the standard model ( sm ) has achieved great success in the last few decades . in particular , the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc experiment @xcite was the last key ingredient to finalize the sm .",
    "however , there are several unsolved problems in the sm , e.g. , explanations of the origin of dark matter ( dm ) , the tiny active neutrino masses , and the inflation , etc . regarding the inflation ,",
    "the bicep2 experiment has recently reported the non - vanishing tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xcite which is the central value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] : @xmath5 this result has not been confirmed yet , but a number of explanations for the result have since been presented .",
    "one interesting attempt is given in the context of the higgs inflation  @xcite-@xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite for recent discussions in the ordinary higgs inflation and related works after the bicep2 result ) .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that a higgs potential with @xmath6 of the non - minimal higgs coupling and a suitable plateau for the inflation can explain the above bicep2 result .",
    "but the plateau is realized by a slightly smaller top mass than the experimental range as @xmath7 gev  @xcite .",
    "then , ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the higgs inflation with the higgs portal dm ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) and the right - handed neutrino can explain the result with the experimental central values of the higgs and top masses , and @xmath8 .",
    "in this scenario , dm ( a real singlet scalar ) and the right - handed neutrino play a crucial role in the realization of a suitable higgs potential , _",
    "i.e. _ these particles are important for high - energy behavior in the evolution of the higgs self - coupling @xmath9 obeying the renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "in addition , the right - handed neutrino can generate the tiny active neutrino mass through the type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "reference  @xcite found one solution , in which the central values were taken for the higgs and top masses , for realistic inflation .",
    "for the quantum corrections to the coupling constants ( @xmath10-functions ) in the model , the numerical analyses included the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions of the sm particles and the leading - order ( lo ) ones from dm and the right - handed neutrino . in this work",
    ", we will analyze the model based on the nlo computations for both the sm and the singlet particles .",
    "in addition , the latest experimental errors for the higgs and top masses will be taken into account in the calculations .    as a result",
    ", we will point out that this inflation model can explain the results of cosmological observations within regions for @xmath11 for the dm mass , @xmath12 for the right - handed neutrino mass , and @xmath2 for the non - minimal higgs coupling to the ricci scalar with @xmath3 @xcite for the higgs and @xmath4 @xcite for the top masses . a strong correlation between the dm and the right - handed neutrino masses",
    "will also be shown and the allowed region of a dm mass will be checked by future dm detection experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we will explain our model . in section 3 , we will briefly review the context of the higgs inflation .",
    "our numerical results will be given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we will also present the relevant @xmath10-functions up to 2-loop level in the model in the appendix .",
    "in this letter , we consider the extended sm with a real singlet scalar and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the adequate lagrangians can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sm lagrangian in which the higgs potential is included as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the higgs doublet field and @xmath16 is its vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the lepton doublet , an sm gauge singlet real scalar , and the right - handed neutrino fields , respectively . the coupling constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the portal coupling of @xmath15 and @xmath18 , the quartic self - coupling of @xmath18 , and the neutrino yukawa coupling constant .",
    "@xmath23 is the right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "we assume that the singlet scalar has odd parity under an additional @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "hence , we can have a candidate for dm when the mass and the portal coupling @xmath20 of @xmath18 are taken to be appropriate values .",
    "the observed tiny neutrino masses can be obtained by the conventional type - i seesaw mechanism generates one active neutrino mass .",
    "others can be obtained by lighter right - handed neutrinos with smaller yukawa coupling . when the neutrino yukawa couplings are smaller than the bottom yukawa coupling , the contributions from the neutrino yukawa couplings to the @xmath10-functions are negligible . in this work ,",
    "we consider a case in which the neutrino yukawa coupling of only one generation of the right - handed neutrino is effective in the @xmath10-functions . ] . we have fixed the active neutrino mass as @xmath25 ev here .    here",
    ", we show the rges to solve : @xmath26 where @xmath27 symbolizes the sm gauge couplings , the top and the neutrino yukawa couplings , and the scalar quartic couplings in our model , and we define @xmath28 with the renormalization scale @xmath29 . in this analysis , we divide the energy region into three parts between the @xmath30 boson mass scale , @xmath31 , and the planck scale , @xmath32 .",
    "each part can be considered as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath9 can be roughly supposed as follows : at first , the evolution of @xmath20 becomes small as @xmath36 becomes small , because the @xmath10-function for @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath20 itself . in this case",
    ", the evolution of @xmath37 is really close to the sm one .",
    "second , the contribution from the additional scalar pushes up the evolution of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we can make @xmath9 positive up to @xmath38 with sufficient magnitude of the additional scalar contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from the right - haded neutrinos pulls down @xmath9 in the region of @xmath35 .        a typical behavior of the running of the higgs quartic coupling is shown in fig.[fig : running ] .",
    "as a result , we can have a suitable higgs potential with a plateau for the inflation around @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "these are the important features for higgs inflation with a real scalar field and right - handed neutrinos just as a sample point . ] . in our estimation ,",
    "the free parameters are the values of the right - handed neutrino and dm masses and non - minimal coupling @xmath40 .",
    "first , we briefly review the ordinary higgs inflation @xcite with the action in the so - called jordan frame , @xmath41 where @xmath40 is the non - minimal coupling of the higgs to the ricci scalar @xmath42 , @xmath43 is given in the unitary gauge , and @xmath14 includes the higgs potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) . with the conformal transformation ( @xmath44 with @xmath45 ) which denotes the transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein one",
    ", one can rewrite the action as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ricci scalar in the einstein frame given by @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a canonically renormalized field as @xmath50 one can calculate the slow - roll parameters as @xmath51 where @xmath52",
    "is obtained - functions of coupling constants including the self - coupling of the higgs up to 2-loop level .",
    "this means that our analysis also contains quantum effects , which partially include effects from the loop level potential . ] as        @xmath53    a typical behavior of the higgs potential @xmath52 is shown in fig.[fig : higgs_pot ] . using slow - roll parameters , the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio",
    "are evaluated as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "finally , the number of e - foldings is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 @xmath58 is the initial ( final ) value of @xmath59 corresponding to the beginning ( end ) of the inflation .",
    "at the point @xmath60 , the slow - roll conditions @xmath61 are broken .",
    "the higgs inflation can be realized even in the sm if the top mass is fine - tuned as @xmath62 for @xmath63 @xcite . with these values ,",
    "the higgs potentials have a plateau and @xmath64 can be achieved by taking @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "even though this framework can accomplish a relevant amount of e - foldings , the required top mass , @xmath65 , is outside @xmath66 @xcite . on the other hand , without the plateau , a sufficient amount of e - foldings can be obtained by assuming @xmath67 . however , this case is plagued with too tiny a tensor - to - scalar ratio on the order of @xmath68 , which is inconsistent with the recent bicep2 result .",
    "consequently , we extend the sm with a real scalar and right - handed neutrinos , in which the evolution of @xmath69 ( equivalent to the higgs potential ) is changed , in order to reproduce the values of cosmological parameters within the experimental range @xmath70 .",
    "in this section , we give the results of our numerical analysis .",
    "we solve rges . ] at 2-loop level for the @xmath10-functions of the relevant couplings in the model . as we discussed above , we analyze within the experimental ranges of the higgs mass @xmath71 @xcite and the top mass @xmath66 @xcite .    as we mentioned in sec.2 , we assume that the additional real scalar is dm . in the case",
    "that the dm mass is greater than the higgs mass ( @xmath72 ) , the portal coupling @xmath36 is well approximated as @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the mass of dm given by @xmath75 .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[fig : mr_ms ] .",
    "one can see that the required values of @xmath23 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 for reproducing suitable cosmological parameters are on a line in the @xmath23-@xmath74 plane .",
    "this is because the form of the higgs potential is strictly constrained and it should be uniquely realized by taking suitable values of @xmath23 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 for given @xmath76 and @xmath70 . a lighter ( heavier ) top ( higgs ) mass gives lower bounds on @xmath23 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 , while a heavier ( lighter ) top ( higgs ) mass leads to upper bounds on these parameters .",
    "finally , we show the explicit range of @xmath23 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 for each higgs mass gev for the dm mass , @xmath77 gev for the right - handed neutrino mass , and @xmath78 for the non - minimal coupling in our model . ] :      @xmath36 is determined by a condition that the singlet scalar gives a sufficient amount of the relic density of the dm , _ i.e. _ @xmath82 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) where @xmath83 is the density parameter of the dm and @xmath84 is the hubble constant . from this condition , @xmath36 is in the range @xmath85 .",
    "the region is consistent with the current experimental constraints so far , and future experiments , _",
    "e.g. _ , xenon1 t or lux for the direct detection , or the combined analysis of the fermi+cta+planck observations might make them clear @xcite . finally , we also comment on the validity of our @xmath10-functions .",
    "since the value of @xmath40 is around @xmath86 as in the above results and it is much smaller than the previous work @xcite , we can utilize our @xmath10-functions up to the inflation scale .      the joint analysis of bicep , the keck array and planck showed only an upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xcite of @xmath87    we show our result respecting @xmath88 in fig.[fig : mr_ms_0.05 ] .",
    "one can easily see that the mass scales of right - handed neutrino and dm do not drastically change compared with the @xmath89 case .",
    "therefore , the future direct - detection experiments of dm can reach even if the mass range of dm shown in fig.[fig : mr_ms_0.05 ] .",
    "the difference appears in the magnitude of non - minimal coupling , @xmath40 .",
    "its magnitude should be slightly larger in the range @xmath90 .",
    "we have investigated the higgs inflation model with the higgs portal dm and the right - handed neutrino by the use of @xmath10-functions up to 2-loop level .",
    "in addition , the latest experimental errors of the top and higgs masses have been taken into account in the calculations . as a result , we pointed out that this inflation model can explain the results of cosmological observations @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 within regions of @xmath94 for the dm mass , @xmath95 for the right - handed neutrino mass , and @xmath2 for the non - minimal higgs coupling to the ricci scalar with @xmath3 for the higgs and @xmath4 for the top masses .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the scales of the right - handed neutrino and dm are not significantly changed even though the tensor - to - scalar ratio decreases as @xmath96 . on the other hand , the non - minimal coupling should be slightly larger than the @xmath89 case as @xmath90 . there is a strong correlation between the dm and the right - handed neutrino masses because the form of the higgs potential is strictly constrained ; it should be uniquely realized by taking suitable values of @xmath23 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 for given @xmath76 and @xmath70 .",
