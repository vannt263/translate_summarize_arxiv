    "the study of large graphs and networks has become an important topic in applied mathematics , computer sciences and beyond @xcite .",
    "the role played by such large graphs in representing the structural skeleton of complex systems  ranging from social to ecological and infrastructural ones  has triggered the production of many indices that try to quantify the different structural characteristics of these networks @xcite . among those mathematical approaches used nowadays for studying networks ,",
    "matrix functions @xcite of adjacency matrices of graphs have received an increasing visibility due to their involvement in the so - called _ communicability functions _",
    "these functions characterize how much information flows between two different nodes of a graph by accounting for a weighted sum of all the routes connecting them . here",
    ", a route is synonymous with a walk connecting two nodes , which is a sequence of ( not necessarily distinct ) consecutive vertices and edges in the graph .",
    "then , the communicability function between the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined by the @xmath2-entry of the following function of the adjacency matrix ( see @xcite and references therein )    @xmath3    where the coefficients @xmath4 are responsible of giving more weight to shorter walks .",
    "the most popular of these communicability functions is the one derived from the scaling of @xmath5 , which gives rise to the exponential of the adjacency matrix ( see further for definitions ) .",
    "this function , and the graph - theoretic invariants derived from it , have been widely applied in practical problems covering a wide range of areas .",
    "just to mention a few , the communicability function is used for studying real - world brain networks and the effects of diseases on the normal functioning of the human brain @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called subgraph centrality @xcite  a sort of self - communicability of a node in a graph  has been used to detect essential proteins in protein - protein interaction networks @xcite .",
    "the network bipartivity  a measure derived from the use of the self - communicability  has found applications ranging from detection of cracks in granular material @xcite , to the stability of fullerenes @xcite , and transportation efficiency of airline networks @xcite .",
    "a typical question when studying the structural indices derived from ( [ eq : general matrix function ] ) when using @xmath5 is whether or not we are penalizing the longer routes in the graph too heavily ( see preliminaries for formal definitions ) @xcite . to understand this problem",
    "let us consider the communicability function between the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a graph :    @xmath6    which gives the number of routes of length @xmath7 connecting these two nodes .",
    "then , when we use @xmath5 a route of length 2 is penalized by 1/2 and a walk of length 3 is penalized by 1/6 . however , a walk of length 5 is penalized by @xmath8 , which could be seen as a very heavy penalization for a relatively short walk between these two nodes .",
    "this means that the longer walks connecting two nodes make a little contribution to the communicability function .",
    "if we consider the function accounting for the self - returning walks starting ( and ending ) at a given node @xmath9 , a heavy penalization of longer walks makes that this index is mainly depending on the degree of the corresponding node , i.e. , the number of edges incident to it .",
    "that is ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the degree of the node @xmath0 .",
    "then , the main question here is to study whether using coefficients @xmath4 that do not penalize the longer walks as heavily as the inverse factorial scaling will reveal some structural information of networks which is important in practical applications of these indices .    here",
    "we consider the use of a double - factorial penalization 1/@xmath12 @xcite of walks as a way to increase the contribution of longer walks in communicability - based functions for graphs and real - world networks .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we want to investigate whether this new penalization of walks produces structural indices that are significantly different from the ones derived from the factorial penalization .",
    "the other goal is to investigate whether the information contained in longer walks is of significant relevance for describing the structure of graphs and real - world networks . while in the first case we can obtain analytical results that account for the similarities and differences among the two penalization schemes , in the second case we need to use some kind of indirect inference .",
    "that is , we aim to explore some practical applications of the indices derived from these two schemes and show whether or not there are significant advantages when using one or the other for solving such problems . in the current work , we conclude that there are not significant differences in the use of any of the two penalization schemes for practical applications of these indices .",
    "however , this conclusion should be read with care as we need to introduce a weighting scheme of all the walks in the graphs in order to achieve such similarities among the indices .",
    "this weighting scheme is based on the use of coefficients of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "when this weighting scheme is used we show here that either @xmath5 or @xmath15 produce similar results for different values of the weighting parameter @xmath16 .",
    "these studies are carried out for both simple graphs and real - world networks representing the protein - protein interaction network of yeast .",
    "however , it should be clear that such a method is not exhaustive and the possibility exists that in other areas of applications the new indices will perform in a significantly different way from the single - factorial ones .",
    "thus , more practical uses of the new indices are needed to extract more definitive conclusions on their use for studying complex networks .",
    "we consider in this work simple , undirected and connected graphs @xmath17 with @xmath18 nodes ( vertices ) and @xmath19 edges .",
    "a _ walk _ of length @xmath7 in @xmath20 is a set of nodes @xmath21 such that for all @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "a__closed walk _ _ is a walk for which @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the adjacency operator on @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 . for simple finite graphs , @xmath25 is the symmetric adjacency matrix of the graph . in the particular case of an undirected network as the ones studied here , the associated adjacency matrix is symmetric , and thus its eigenvalues are real .",
    "we label the eigenvalues of @xmath25 in non - increasing order : @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath25 is a real - valued , symmetric matrix , we can decompose @xmath25 into    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath31 $ ] is orthogonal , where @xmath32 is the eigenvector associated with @xmath33 .",
    "the graphs considered here are connected , therefore @xmath25 is irreducible and from the perron - frobenius theorem we can deduce that @xmath34 and that the leading eigenvector @xmath35 , which will sometimes be referred to as the _ perron vector _ , can be chosen such that its components @xmath36 are positive for all @xmath37 .",
    "the degree of a node is the number of edges incident to that node .",
    "the graph density is defined as    @xmath38    where @xmath19 is the number of edges in the graph .",
    "the so - called exponential communicability function @xcite is defined for a pair of nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath20 as    @xmath39    the @xmath9 terms of the communicability function characterize the degree of participation of a node in all subgraphs of the network , giving more weight to the smaller ones .",
    "thus , it is known as the _ subgraph centrality _ of the corresponding node @xcite . the global structural index defined by    @xmath40",
    "is known as the _ estrada index _ of the graph .",
    "these indices have been generalized by the use of a parameter @xmath16 in the matrix function following the work of @xcite :    @xmath41    watts - strogatz clustering coefficient for each node @xmath42 of degree @xmath43 and the number of triangles the node is involved in , @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45    and the global clustering coefficient is calculated as @xmath46",
    "let us start this section by recalling what the double - factorial is .",
    "let @xmath7 be a positive integer , then the double - factorial @xmath12 is defined by    @xmath47    as a generalization of the factorial @xmath48 , the double - factorial appears very suitable for use as the penalization factor of the number of walks of length @xmath7 in the definition of communicability functions .",
    "that is , let us consider the terms @xmath49 , where every walk of length @xmath7 is penalized by @xmath12 and let us compare it with the penalization based on @xmath48 . to give a simple example we consider a graph having @xmath50 nodes and @xmath51 edges and show in figure ( [ compare double factorial ] ) the values of @xmath52 and of @xmath53 for @xmath54 . as can be seen , the values of @xmath52 are about @xmath55 for @xmath56 , while this value is obtained for the double - factorial only when @xmath57 .     for @xmath58 being the factorial ( blue broken line ) and the double - factorial ( red continuous line).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    as we are interested in defining matrix functions that allow us to calculate several graph invariants , we start by proving the following result .",

    "is provided by the calculation of the matrix error function . in order to circumvent this difficulty we make use here of the remarkable similarity between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( see figure ( [ tanh and erf](a ) ) ) . as can be seen in figure ( [ tanh and erf](a ) )",
    "there is a gap between the functions in the interval @xmath66 .",

    "we have found that @xmath68 dramatically reduces the gap between the two functions as can be seen in figure ( [ tanh and erf](b ) ) .",

    "the double - factorial estrada index of graphs is bounded by @xmath125 , which is similar to @xmath126 . in the next section",
    "we will see that the two indices display similarities when used to analyze real - world networks .",
    "an important problem to be considered in practical applications is that the entries of @xmath127 grow very fast with @xmath7 in large graphs with relatively high density .",
    "although most of real - world networks are sparse , the calculation of indices based on @xmath128 can be affected by the presence of these very large numbers .",
    "for instance , for a network representing the synaptic connections among the neurons of the worm _ c. elegans _ , which has @xmath129 nodes and edge density @xmath130 the entries of @xmath128 are bigger than @xmath131 , which far exceeds the largest finite floating - point number in ieee single precision ( @xmath132 ) , but still below the largest finite floating - point number in ieee double precision ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "however , for the network representing the usa system of airports having @xmath134 nodes and @xmath135 the entries of @xmath128 exceed this maximum floating number and a program like matlab returns infinite for all its entries . in those cases the adjacency matrix can be multiplied by @xmath136 in order to reduce the magnitude of the entries of @xmath128 as we will illustrate in some of the examples in this section .",
    "we then start by studying the influence of this parameter @xmath16 on the function @xmath128 .",
    "we now conduct a computational study of the index @xmath137 of all connected graphs with @xmath138 nodes and compare it with the index @xmath139 for values @xmath140 . in figure ( [ estrada indices with 8 nodes](a ) ) we illustrate the correlation between the two indices for @xmath141 that show the existence of a power - law relation between them .",
    "however , by zooming the smallest values region of the indices  this region corresponds to graphs with relatively low density of edges it is revealed that such a correlation between the two indices is far from being simple ( see ( [ estrada indices with 8 nodes](b ) ) .",
    "this reveals the fact that decreasing the penalization of the walks in graphs from the factorial to the double - factorial make non - trivial changes in the ordering of the graphs , particularly for graphs with relatively low density of edges .",
    "this is very important as most of real - world networks are sparse and we should expect significant differences between the two different indices for them .",
    "more interestingly , we plot the two indices for @xmath142 in ( [ estrada indices with 8 nodes](c ) ) where it can be observed that the correlation between the two indices have now been dramatically decreased .     and @xmath137 for all the 11,117 connected graphs on 8 nodes using @xmath141 .",

    "( c ) the same as in ( a ) but using @xmath142.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=33.0% ]    in order to understand this decay in the correlation between the two indices we express them in terms of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix :    @xmath144    @xmath145    it is easy to see that when @xmath146 both indices are dominated by the principal eigenvalue ( spectral radius ) of the adjacency matrix , i.e. ,    @xmath147    @xmath148    due to the fact that @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "then , it is evident that both indices are highly correlated . on the contrary , when @xmath151 , the second term of ( [ eq : gamma eigenvalues ] ) becomes more relevant .",
    "first of all , in this case the term @xmath73 is smaller than one for many of the eigenvalues of the network , which means that a larger number of eigenvalues and not only those close to zero make a contribution to this part of the function .",
    "although the first term of ( [ eq : gamma eigenvalues ] ) may still correlate with @xmath139 , the second term does not , which results in a lack of global correlation between @xmath137 and @xmath139 when @xmath151 .",
    "this lack of correlation for small values of @xmath16 will be useful for the study of some of the indices derived from the matrix function @xmath128 .",
    "we now study a group of 61 real - world networks representing social , biological , ecological , infrastructural and technological systems .",
    "we first illustrate the correlation between @xmath137 and @xmath139 when @xmath152 . to avoid size effects we normalized both indices by dividing their logarithms by the number of nodes . as can be seen in figure ( [ real world networks ] ) in general",
    "there is a good correlation between the two indices except for a few networks  about one third of the total number of networks studied  which display large deviations from the linear trend observed .",
    "that is , there are 19 networks for which @xmath153 is significantly larger than expected from the linear correlation between this index and @xmath154 . excluding these 19 outliers the pearson correlation coefficient between the two indices is @xmath155 .",
    "we have calculated the average watts - strogatz clustering coefficient and the global transitivity of all the networks studied .",
    "they have average values for the 61 networks studied of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "however , if we consider the networks that deviate significantly from the linear correlation between the two indices , the clustering coefficients have average values of @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively , which are very much higher than the average observed for the total networks studies . indeed , if we consider only those networks for which there is a perfect fit between the two indices studied we obtain average clustering coefficients of @xmath160 and @xmath161 , which confirms that the ` anomalous ' behavior is observed for networks with the highest clustering coefficients among all the networks studied .",
    "if we consider the difference between the two indices studied we have    @xmath162    which clearly indicates that the first term is the one having the largest contribution .",
    "we recall that @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the number of triangles .",
    "then , when @xmath151 the number of triangles has the largest influence in the difference between the two indices .",
    "consequently , the networks which have the largest clustering  which account for the relative abundance of triangles  display the largest difference between the two indices among all the networks studied .     and @xmath165 normalized by the number of nodes for 61 real - world networks.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "one of the most important uses of matrix functions in the study of networks is the definition of centrality indices .",
    "the double - factorial subgraph centrality is defined as the diagonal entries of the matrix function @xmath128 , which can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix as    @xmath166\\textrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\lambda_{j}^{2}}{2}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the way the double - factorial estrada index is correlated to @xmath139 for large values of @xmath16 is similar to how the double - factorial subgraph centrality @xmath167 is also correlated to the subgraph centrality @xmath168 for large values of @xmath16 . in figure ( [ subgraphcentral ] )",

    "we give the values of essential proteins identified by other centrality indices : eigenvector ( 97 ) ; degree ( 86 ) ; closeness ( 77 ) ; betweenness ( 71 ) and a random ranking of the proteins identifies 52 essential proteins .     and",

    "we have introduced here a new matrix function for studying graphs and real - world networks .",
    "this new matrix function of the adjacency matrix of a graph is based on the double - factorial penalization of walks between nodes in a graph . in order to make these indices more general we introduced the a weighting scheme of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "when this weighting scheme is used we have shown here that both @xmath5 and @xmath15 produce similar indices in terms of their applications to practical problems on real - world networks , such as the identification of essential proteins in the yeast pin .",
    "it is important to remark that while the best results for @xmath168 are obtained when @xmath181 , those for @xmath167 are reached when @xmath151 .",
    "it seems in general that the maximum similarity among the indices derived from both penalization schemes are obtained when @xmath16 is modulated in this way for both indices , i.e. , @xmath182 and @xmath183 . using this approach we can conclude indirectly that , at least for the practical problem studied , the structural information contained in",
    "the longer walks on graphs is not as relevant as the information contained in the shorter walks for characterizing their structure .",
    "however , we should emphasize that this conclusion is not necessarily of general applicability and the possibility exists that in other areas of applications the new indices perform in a significantly different way from the single - factorial ones .",
    "thus , more practical applications of the new indices are needed to extract more definitive conclusions on their use for study complex networks .",
