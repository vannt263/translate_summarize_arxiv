    "various analog models of gtr have been proposed , such as the acoustic fluid @xcite , liquid helium @xcite , fermi gases @xcite , slow light @xcite , nonlinear electromagnetic waveguides @xcite , graphene @xcite , ion rings @xcite and bose - einstein condensate ( bec)@xcite .",
    "many of the notions of atomic and molecular physics can be realized on an entirely different scale , namely , in optomechanical systems .",
    "the field of optomechanics is currently undergoing rapid experimental and theoretical progress .",
    "typically , electromagnetic radiation and macroscopic mechanical oscillators can interact via radiation pressure in a fabry - perot cavity with a movable end mirror .",
    "this interaction is the basis of various optomechanical phenomena which can occur in a wide range of system sizes and parameters ( for review , see @xcite ) .",
    "many of the rudiments of quantum optomechanics date back to the early attempts of the investigation of one of the most prominent predictions of gtr , i.e. , the gravitational waves .",
    "however , during the past decade , significant efforts have been devoted to developing and implementing optomechanical interaction for position or force sensing @xcite , backaction cooling @xcite , quantum state transfer @xcite , optomechanical entanglement generation @xcite , optomechanically induced transparency realization @xcite , and generating self - sustained mechanical oscillations @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of the optomechanical systems , which has not been investigated much yet , is that they can be considered as promising candidate systems for quantum simulation applications .",
    "for instance , it has very recently been shown @xcite how to realize the so - called sphere - coherent motional states of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical cavity in the presence of a two - level atom and how to use the optomechanical parameters to control the curvature of the sphere .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the possibility of simulating the curved spacetimes by photonic fields interacting with a mechanical oscillator operating in the reversed dissipation regime ( rdr ) of optomechanics @xcite . due to the radiation pressure force ,",
    "an effective kerr - type photon - photon interaction arises which is mediated by the mirror motion .",
    "the emergence of fluid - like behavior for photons is the consequence of this photon - photon interaction so that we can use the hydrodynamic equations for the photonic fluid to study the corresponding effective metric for the propagation of fluctuations in the photon fluid . in this manner",

    "the photon dispersion relation becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trapping potential and @xmath14 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling rate .",
    "therefore , in a fabry - prot cavity with a movable end mirror , spatial confinement of the photons in the @xmath7 direction breaks the symmetry and eventually it provides a finite effective mass ( @xmath15 ) for the photons in the plane perpendicular to the cavity axis @xcite . this makes the photon gas in the @xmath16-plane to be effectively two - dimensional .",

    "this assumption is justified by using a cavity with a high - quality factor ( small damping rate @xmath38 ) and a mechanical mode with a large damping rate .",
    "of course , it is not the normal dissipation regime of optomechanics where the mechanical dissipation rate @xmath39 is much smaller than the cavity linewidth @xmath40 . therefore , one has to engineer a mechanical mode with an effective large damping rate .",

    "under such a circumstance , the system can enter unstable region and the routh - hurwitz stability conditions are violated @xcite .    driving the system with an ancillary optical mode with a large damping rate ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) tuned to the red side of the optical cavity @xcite , as the consequence of the optomechanical interaction ,",
    "the ancillary mode induces an optical damping to the mechanical oscillator . working in the resolved - sideband regime and using a red detuned driving laser together with a weak optomechanical coupling the net effect of the ancillary optical mode",
