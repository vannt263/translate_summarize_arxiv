    "interestingly , most of the newest milky way satellite candidates were all discovered near the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . while this could be nothing more than a location - based selection effect ( the lmc happens to lie next to the region probed by the year one data release of des ) , @xcite show that several of the candidates could very well be satellites of the lmc , and their discovery highlights the potential for discovering ultra - faint satellites of other more massive dwarf satellites , or of isolated dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "the scale - free nature of the subhalo mass function in @xmath13cdm  suggests that groups of subhalos should be common @xcite . because low - mass halos form earlier , are denser , and fall into smaller hosts before larger ones @xcite",

    "phoenix has a stellar mass of @xmath158 and is about @xmath159 away .",
    "it is falling into the milky way with a velocity of @xmath160 @xcite and is likely on first approach , meaning that it is a good analog to the isolated systems simulated in this work .",

    "in general , for future telescopes that have a limited number of pointings available , targeting the @xmath164 region around isolated dwarf galaxies should prove to be a much more efficient strategy than pointing into blank sky , as it should increase the chances of observing an ultra - faint satellite by @xmath8 .",

    "their figure 2 does seem to show convergence in their highest resolution simulation run with reionization , but the gas particle mass in their highest resolution run ( @xmath168 ) is an order of magnitude higher than the total stellar mass formed in most of the the satellites that form in our simulations , indicating that they would fail to detect these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , their reionization turns on at a higher redshift than does ours ( @xmath47 ) , which may lead to a higher halo mass cutoff for star formation .",
    "@xcite run a zoom - in simulation of a small group of seven dwarf galaxies with a range of virial masses ( @xmath169 @xmath170 ) .",
    "they find that galaxies only form in the halos with present day @xmath171 , and of the halos that form galaxies , the two with @xmath172 only form stars long after the end of reionization .",
    "although they do not model @xmath173 cooling nor self - shielding in their simulations , they do approximate the effects of @xmath173 cooling and run a parallel simulation without a cosmic uv background . in their reionization - free simulation ,",
    "all dwarfs form stars , but they show that the gas in the three low mass halos never reaches the column density required for self shielding .",
    "their baryonic particle mass is @xmath174 , the same particle mass we achieve in the low resolution runs of @xmath23 ( see @xcite for details ) . in our low resolution runs ,",
    "each of the most massive subhalos forms an object with stellar mass similar to its high resolution counterpart , but at this resolution each satellite object consists of only @xmath175 star particles .",
    "while it is difficult to say conclusively that resolution is the main driver of their apparent halo mass limit for star formation , in general it has been the case that every time resolution is increased in simulations , the minimum virial mass for a halo that can form stars has approached lower values @xcite .",
    "in addition to enabling the formation of galaxies with @xmath69 lower than the low resolution baryonic particle mass , higher resolution simulations allow for a more accurate description of shielding , which will also affect the minimum halo mass that can form stars . furthermore , resolving the formation of dense substructures that collapse under self - gravity and become self - shielding requires resolving the jeans / toomre mass of the galaxies , which can be as low as @xmath176 ( and corresponds to a required force / gravitational softening of at least @xmath177 ) in baryon - poor dwarfs .",
    "our simulations do not escape the challenges of imperfect resolution , but because our particle mass is an order of magnitude lower than most simulations that attempt to form galaxies in low mass halos , we can push down the predicted low mass limit for the halos that can form ultra - faint satellites . rather than attempt to make a prediction for the low__est",
    "_ _ mass halo that can form a galaxy , we predict that ultra - faint dwarf galaxies _ can _ form in dark matter subhalos as low mass as @xmath65 . while we can not state with certainty that these galaxies are fully converged in our high resolution runs , the stellar masses of the satellites do show a better convergence between low and high resolution runs than do the centrals .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of the convergence of the centrals ) .",
    "additionally , at these low masses , we still see sensitivity to spatial resolution and feedback ( e.g. the second satellite of @xmath30 ) .",
    "more and higher resolution runs of dwarfs with @xmath178 that vary feedback prescriptions , reionization onset and spectrum , and particle mass are needed to fully probe the low mass end of the simulated stellar mass function and the @xmath81 relation .",
    "in the @xmath13cdm   paradigm , all dark matter halos , from those around giant galaxy clusters to those hosting ultra - faint galaxies , should be filled with subhalos .",
    "we have used ultra - high resolution ( @xmath179 ) simulations with the psph version of ` gizmo ` @xcite and the feedback in realistic environments ( fire ) prescriptions @xcite to predict that subhalos of isolated dwarf halos should form galaxies .",
    "most of the subhalos around dwarf galaxies are expected to be of low - mass ( @xmath180 ) and we predict that some should host ultra - faint galaxies with @xmath181 .",
    "if these tiny satellites are observed , it would provide evidence that dark matter substructure persists to very small scales , as predicted in the standard paradigm .    using the dark - matter - only simulations of the elvis suite ,",
    "we show that each isolated field dwarf ( @xmath182 ) galaxy in the local group has about a @xmath126 chance of hosting at least one satellite with @xmath116 . the extended @xmath164 regions around known field dwarfs in the local group should prove to be fruitful search areas for ultra - faint satellites , as each pointing towards a dwarf also contains all of the volume of the milky way dark matter halo along the line of sight to that region .",
    "the phoenix dwarf galaxy in particular is an excellent target due to its proximity to the milky way and the high probability that it is on first infall .    although we consider only isolated dwarfs in this work , it is worth noting that some satellites of the milky way may also have their own satellites .",
    "@xcite show , using the elvis simulations , that approximately @xmath183 of milky way satellites ( but as many as @xmath184 depending on the infall time and mass of the group ) , fell in as a part of lmc - size groups , and that several of the recent des satellites are likely satellites of the lmc .",
    "a simple calculation for a rigid satellite assuming the common halo mass scale for milky way dwarf spheroidals ( @xmath185 ) orbiting a milky way - size host ( @xmath186 ) shows that fornax could potentially hold on to ultra - faint satellites residing within its inner @xmath187 .",
    "leo i and leo ii could each host ultra - faints out to @xmath188 , and sculptor out to @xmath189 , assuming each satellite is on first infall .",
    "this suggests that these galaxies might also be suitable candidates to host  satellites of satellites \" .",
    "we do not see a sharp cut - off or break in the @xmath81 relation , at least for @xmath140 .",
    "we do , however , see a sharp cut - off in halos that host galaxies with uniformly ancient stellar populations .",
    "the ultra - faint dwarfs in our simulations form most of their stars in the first billion years after the big bang and are subsequently deprived of the cold gas required for star formation due to the ionizing background radiation , and not by infall into a more massive dark matter halo .",
    "we predict that below a critical mass threshold ( @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) all galaxies are ubiquitously ancient and , unlike more massive galaxies ( @xmath192 ) that are nearly uniformly star forming in the field @xcite , both central and satellite ultra - faint galaxies should all be quenched .    for satellites with @xmath193 ,",
    "it is likely that infall time is one of the primary factors in quenching their star formation .",
    "massive satellites ( @xmath194 ) have been shown to have extremely long quenching timescales , probably due to the cutting off of the fresh gas supply after infall @xcite .",
    "slightly less massive galaxies ( @xmath195 ) are likely quenched over much shorter timescales by the tidal or ram - pressure forces they experience upon falling in as satellites @xcite .",
    "however , it is likely that the quenching of ultra - faints is completely independent of their infall time , and set by the timing of the onset of and the mass they had at reionization .",
    "the precise stellar masses of the  ultra - faint \" dwarfs in our simulations are likely also sensitive to the reionization redshift ( with an earlier onset of reionization likely to quench star formation in higher mass halos ) and may also be sensitive to star formation physics at very low metallicities .",
    "we plan to explore these dependencies in future work , but here we point out that it is possible to form ultra - faint satellites of regular dwarf galaxies and highlight that they are quenched by reionization rather than infall .",
    "the recent discovery of up to nine milky way dwarf satellite galaxy candidates in the southern sky by des @xcite has important consequences for our understanding of star formation in low mass galaxies .",
    "of particular interest is des j0344.3 - 4331 ( eridanus ii ) , because of its large distance from the milky way ( @xmath196 ) @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "whether the satellite is on first infall or even headed out after a pericentric passage , it was likely accreted within the last @xmath197 .",
    "given that the initial age estimate for eridanus ii shows that it likely has an ancient stellar population ( @xmath198 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this would mean that it was quenched long before infall .",
    "if confirmed in follow - up observations , eridanus ii would be the first known ultra - faint galaxy shown to be quenched in the field , supporting our findings that , below a critical mass scale @xmath199 , all galaxies host ancient stellar populations quenched by reionization - related feedback , and not by environmental processes .",
