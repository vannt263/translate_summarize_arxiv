    "this paper describes a geometrical framework for the study of conformally invariant fields in conformally flat spaces in four dimensions .",
    "applications to scalar and electromagnetic fields are made .",
    "in particular , we show that the equation @xmath0 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the laplace - beltrami operator , leads under very moderate assumptions to both the maxwell equations and the conformal eastwood - singer gauge conditions @xcite on @xmath4d conformally flat spaces .",
    "in addition , our proof of this result allows us to propose a new fiber bundle in which , broadly speaking , the maxwell equations on a conformally flat space are converted into constrained scalar equations on minkowski space .",
    "this drastically simplifies the practical calculations .",
    "the basic geometrical idea is to build four - dimensional spaces as the intersection in @xmath1 , of a surface and the five - dimensional null cone ( invariant under the linear conformal group so@xmath5 ) .",
    "the metric on such a space is induced from that of @xmath1 . in particular , for any given robertson - walker ( rw ) metric , one can always find a surface such that the induced metric is the rw metric .",
    "now , to each point of a space obtained in this way corresponds a half line of the cone , hence all spaces can be realized as subsets of the set of the half lines : the cone modulo the dilations .",
    "in addition , in the intersection of two such subsets the spaces are related through a weyl rescaling . as a special case",
    ", the minkowski space can be obtained in that scheme .",
    "this allows us to build a particular atlas of the cone modulo the dilations . in effect",
    ", copies of that minkowski space can be obtained by displacing the surface intersecting the cone thanks to the action of o@xmath6 .",
    "this generates a covering of the set of the half lines .",
    "one can go a step further by introducing coordinates of @xmath7 with the specific property that their restriction to a particular minkowski space of the covering are the usual minkowskian cartesian coordinates .",
    "each space of the covering together with its corresponding set of minkowskian cartesian coordinates can be turned into a local chart of the cone modulo the dilations , which is thus endowed with a minkowskian atlas .",
    "this atlas is one of the key ingredients to perform simple calculations . in particular",
    ", it allows us to use the local weyl rescaling to handle global problems .",
    "the study of conformal fields , as the electromagnetic field , viewed as restrictions to four dimensional spaces of fields on @xmath7 can be traced back to the seminal paper of dirac @xcite .",
    "there , he introduces the `` six cone formalism '' which sets the conditions , mainly the homogeneity of the fields on @xmath7 , to obtain conformal minkowskian fields .",
    "this approach takes into account the so@xmath5 symmetry of the minkowskian equations under consideration from the beginning .",
    "this formalism has been extended in group theoretical context by mack and salam @xcite almost @xmath8 years later and in study of conformal generalizations of qed on minkowski and anti - de  sitter spaces in the mid 80 s by many authors ( see @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "the fact that the conformal group so@xmath5 includes as subgroups , besides the poincar and the anti - de  sitter groups , the de  sitter group was our starting point in the study of the relation between conformal scalar field in the de  sitter and minkowski space @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the generalization to the electromagnetic field in a conformal gauge on the de  sitter space was tackled in @xcite . there following @xcite we used a method of auxiliary fields to obtain a two - point function in a conformal gauge which reduces to the eastwood - singer gauge @xcite .",
    "these works was concerned by free quantum fields , but part of the methods used also applied in the case of classical fields with sources . in that context , the tools previously build , especially the use of minkowskian charts on the set of half lines , allowed us to reproduce , with simplified calculations , the result obtained by higuchi and cheong @xcite for the problem of two charges in de  sitter space .",
    "the geometrical framework we build up in the present work encompass and generalizes the method we developed in these previous studies .",
    "it extends the formalism to a class of conformally flat spaces which contains in particular the spaces endowed with a rw metric .",
    "it provides an atlas which permits a global use of the weyl relation to minkowski space .",
    "last but not least , it also provides a deeper view on the geometrical nature of the objects involved .",
    "this article is organized as follows . the sec .",
    "[ sec - geometry ] is devoted to the geometrical framework .",
    "we first gives a global view and motivate the main definitions .",
    "then we turn to the geometrical formulation and consequences on tensors fields of the assumptions of transversality and homogeneity .",
    "this allows us to see how the weyl rescaling emerges in this context .",
    "the action of the so@xmath5 group on tensor fields is then discussed . the construction of the minkowskian atlas , and the expression of some properties in it follows .",
    "this section ends by the proof that all the rw metrics can be obtained in the present formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec - scalarfield ] , we discuss the conformal scalar fields , we show how both equations and fields on @xmath7 and on a conformally flat space are related . the sec .",
    "[ sec - maxwell ] contains the proof of the proposition that the maxwell equations and the eastwood - singer gauge condition are obtained from homogeneous one form fields satisfying the laplace - beltrami in @xmath7 and some transversality requirement .",
    "although the result is purely geometrical , the proof makes use of calculations performed in the minkowskian atlas .",
    "this make apparent the practical calculation method inherited from this geometrical framework .",
    "some generalizations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - somecom ] . some properties of homogeneous tensors",
    "are reminded in appendix [ sec - homogtensor ] .",

    "definitions and conventions are collected in appendix [ sec - appendicedef ] . for convenience , the conventions for indices are repeated here : @xmath9 the space @xmath7 is provided with the metric @xmath10 .",
    "a point of @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath11 or @xmath12 , the letter @xmath12 refers most often to the linear structure of @xmath7 .",
    "this section is intended to give the reader a global view of the formalism .",
    "we motivate the introduction of key structures as the cone modulo the dilations or the bundle @xmath13 .",
    "we give their definitions and their main properties , leaving the proofs to the forthcoming sections . for convenience a reminder of definitions and conventions",
    "is given in appendix [ sec - appendicedef ] .",
    "the main geometrical construction is pictured in fig . [ fig - globalpicture ] .    a four dimensional manifold @xmath14",
    "is obtained as the intersection of the five dimensional null cone @xmath15 of @xmath7 and a surface @xmath16 , in which @xmath17 is homogeneous of degree one . on a manifold @xmath14 each point is intercepted by a single half line of @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , thanks to the homogeneity of @xmath17 , each half line intercepts at most once the manifold @xmath14 . as a consequence each manifold @xmath14 can be realized as a subset @xmath18 of a single set : the set @xmath19 of the half lines of @xmath15 , namely the cone modulo the dilations .",
    "this construction can be translated in relations between spaces which are collected in the following diagram @xmath20 }   \\xymatrix { \\setr^6 & \\\\ x_f \\ar[u]^{l_f } & x'_f\\subset \\mathcal{c ' } \\ar[ul]_{l'_f } \\ar[l]^{\\lambda_f } } \\ ] ] in which @xmath21 & \\mapsto x_f : = [ x ] \\cap x_f , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] is the half line of @xmath15 ( that is a point of @xmath19 ) which contains the point @xmath11 , @xmath23 is the canonical injection , and @xmath24&\\mapsto x_f : = [ x ] \\cap x_f,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a diffeomorphism .",
    "note that , thanks to the homogeneity of @xmath17 one has @xmath25 , and thus @xmath26    now , a set of half lines may cross several manifolds @xmath14 , in other words the realizations @xmath18 on @xmath19 of these manifolds have a non - empty intersection , in that case one can define some common coordinate systems ( at least locally ) .",
    "this property allows us to drastically simplify many practical calculations , this can be explained as follows .",
    "firstly , as we will prove in sec .",
    "[ sec - minkatlas ] , the cone modulo the dilations as a manifold can be covered by a collection of realizations @xmath18 of minkowski spaces , each endowed with a cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "we will call minkowskian atlas this covering together with these coordinates , and minkowskian charts the elements of this atlas . secondly",
    ", we will prove in sec .",
    "[ sec - weylrelation ] that in their intersection two realizations @xmath18 are related through a weyl rescaling . finally , due to the existence of the above covering all the manifolds @xmath14",
    "are weyl related to a minkowski space , that is are conformally flat .",
    "in addition , and ( this is the point for the simplifications ) a conformal equation reads under its minkowskian form in a minkowskian chart .    amongst the spaces obtained within this scheme",
    "the space @xmath27 , which is obtained as the intersection of the cone with the @xmath28-sphere @xmath29 , provides a realization of the abstract manifold @xmath19 itself .",
    "indeed , @xmath29 is intercepted only once by each half line of @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - globalpicture ] ) .",
    "we will use this realization of @xmath19 , which is included in the einstein space , for drawing conformal diagrams in sec .",
    "[ sec - minkatlas ] and some practical calculations ( sec .",
    "[ sec - scalarfield ] ) .",
    "other important structures , more specifically related to the maxwell field , have to be introduced . in the scheme we use , which is inspired by the dirac s `` six cone formalism '' @xcite , the maxwell field @xmath30 , a one form field on @xmath14 ,",
    "is obtained from a one form field @xmath31 on @xmath7 homogeneous of degree zero .",
    "we remind ( see appendix [ sec - homogtensor ] ) that the cartesian components of @xmath31 are then homogeneous of degree -1 . in sec .",
    "[ sec - maxwell ] we will prove the following property  : for @xmath31 homogeneous of degree zero , @xmath32 homogeneous of degree @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 the field @xmath35 and the current @xmath36 defined on @xmath14 satisfy the maxwell equations and the eastwood - singer gauge condition @xcite  : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath14 . note that for maximally symmetric spaces the eastwood - singer gauge condition reduces to the more familiar form @xmath39 with a constant ricci scalar @xmath40 .",
    "note also that the two conditions appearing in ( [ eq - box6aetdieze - overviewformalism ] ) mean that the vector fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 are tangent respectively to @xmath15 and to @xmath14 .    beside the property by itself",
    "its proof makes use of a new geometrical structure : the fiber bundle @xmath43 it is obtained in restricting the base space of the cotangent bundle @xmath44 to @xmath14 .",
    "this object allows us to solve some problems in a more simple way than by tackling them directly on @xmath14",
    ". it also describes more accurately the transition between the fields on @xmath7 and those on @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely , although under the assumptions made in ( [ eq - box6aetdieze - overviewformalism ] ) the maxwell field @xmath30 is directly obtained as the pullback of @xmath31 .",
    "the proof of this result involves an intermediate step in which the equations @xmath45 are , in a sense which will be made precise in sec .",
    "[ sec - maxwell ] , restricted to the six conformal scalar equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the scalar laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath14 and in which both the @xmath48 s and the @xmath49 s belongs to the set @xmath50 of the sections of @xmath51 .",
    "these equations reduce ( when the two constraints of ( [ eq - box6aetdieze - overviewformalism ] ) are applied ) to the maxwell equations and the eastwood - singer condition ( [ eq - maes - overviewformalism ] ) .",
    "however they are more easier to handle .",
    "even more , when quantizing the electromagnetic field , these equations account directly for the gauge fixing : part of the @xmath52 s components leads to the maxwell field , the others carry constraints @xcite .    the field @xmath48 is obtained from the field @xmath31 by restricting the base of @xmath44 to @xmath14 and the field @xmath30 from the field @xmath48 by further restricting the fiber @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the relations between @xmath55 and @xmath30 ( also true for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) are collected in the following diagram @xmath58_{\\widetilde{l_f } } \\ar[dr]^{l^*_f } & \\\\",

    "this is a condition on tensor fields which will appear very often . roughly speaking , for a tensor @xmath65 fulfilling this relation , the map @xmath66 has a good behavior with respect to group invariance , weyl relation , equations",
    "... this condition reads as follows : a tensor @xmath67 fulfills the transversality condition if and only if , for any @xmath68 and for any @xmath69 , @xmath70as soon as one of the arguments @xmath71 is equal to the dilation field @xmath72 ,  @xmath73 .",
    "note that , when @xmath74 , one often finds the little bit stronger condition @xmath75 which , for @xmath76 , reduces to @xmath77 ( from which the name `` transversality condition '' originates after dirac s paper @xcite , altough in the context of mechanics this kind of condition is usualy termed `` horizontality '' ) , equivalently in an index - free notation : @xmath78 .",
    "this condition will eventually be required for any field considered here . for quantum fields , as usual",
    "when a gauge condition is present , the implementation of the constraint at the quantum level ( in a gupta - bleuler quantization scheme ) is done after the quantization .      in this section ,",
