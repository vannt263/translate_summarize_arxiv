    "an exotic and distinctive feature of interacting one - dimensional systems is the phenomenon of spin - charge separation where the elementary excitations of the fermionic system are decoupled charge and spin bosonic modes that propagate at different velocities.@xcite at low energies , luttinger liquid theory@xcite has been quite successful at describing the properties of one - dimensional systems such as quantum wires@xcite and nanotubes.@xcite one of the elegant features of the theory is the ease with which one can obtain exact results , thanks to the quadratic form of the hamiltonian describing the low energy properties , @xmath0 , \\label{1dhamltn}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 stands for the charge and spin sectors and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are bosonic fields satisfying @xmath4=-i\\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\delta_{ij}{\\rm sgn}(x - x')$ ] , and representing charge / spin density fluctuations and charge / spin current density fluctuations , respectively , and @xmath5 are the collective mode velocities .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 describe the interactions in the 1-d system . for repulsive interactions @xmath7 , and for su(2 ) symmetry in the spin sector @xmath8 .",
    "generally , the theory is applied under the assumption that both the spin and charge modes operate at low energy .",
    "but at low densities , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 the bohr radius for the material ) , strong interactions open up a wide window between the characteristic energies of the charge and the spin sectors by suppressing the spin exchange energy @xmath12 while enhancing the charge energy @xmath13 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath14 is raised into this window of energy , @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 boltzmann s constant ) , the spin sector consists of thermally randomized spins that are no longer described by ( [ 1dhamltn ] ) while the charge sector effectively becomes a spinless luttinger liquid ( ll ) .",
    "a one - dimensional system in this regime is known as a spin - incoherent luttinger liquid ( sill).@xcite    several properties of the sill have already been established theoretically,@xcite but the experimental effort has been slowed due to the difficulty of reaching the aforementioned window of energy",
    ". nevertheless , there are experimental indications of this regime in high quality quantum wires grown with the cleaved - edge technique,@xcite in recent split - gate devices,@xcite and possibly even in low - density carbon nanotubes.@xcite given the recent progress in manufacturing hybrid devices consisting of superconductors ( sc ) and ferromagnets ( fm ) , and one - dimensional systems such as nanotubes , we propose here that the properties of the sill be experimentally investigated by studying junctions of superconductors and ferromagnets with a sill . as we show below , these sill hybrid systems lead to distinctive behaviors ( relative to a ll or non - interacting 1-d system ) that will allow the sill to be identified in various types of transport measurements , and in the dynamics of a coupled ferromagnet .    in early work on transport in the spin - incoherent regime",
    ", matveev found that a sill adiabatically connected to non - interacting leads resulted in a universal reduction of the conductance of a single - channel quantum wire from @xmath17 to @xmath18.@xcite this effect has been ascribed to the deactivation of the spin channel , whereby the spin excitations are reflected while the charge ones propagate freely . in a recent related work",
    ", the authors studied the problem of a sill adiabatically connected to two superconductors .",
    "it was found that the critical josephson current through such a sc - sill - sc systems suffers the same fate : the critical value of the josephson current is halved relative to the ll case.@xcite these universal results follow from the assumption of adiabaticity of the contacts between the sill and the leads / sc , which may not be satisfied in some experimental situations .    in this work",
    "we study the transport properties of a sill in the opposite limit where it is contacted via tunnel junctions to a superconductor and/or a ferromagnet .",
    "we will discuss several scenarios that may be implemented experimentally with existing technologies .",
    "the central aim of this work is to contribute to our fundamental understanding of the sill by addressing its properties in hybrid structures , and to add to the arsenal of experiments that can be carried out to probe it and infer its existence .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "for the case of a fm tunnel coupled to a sill , we compute the spin current pumped into the sill due to a time - dependent magnetization in the ferromagnet",
    ". the algebraic form of the expression for the pumped spin current is the same as that for non - interacting fermions , or a luttinger liquid , but the coefficients appearing have a temperature dependence characteristic of the sill .",
    "we argue the spin transport is diffusive and under this assumption compute the renormalization ( due to the pumped spin current and its back - flow ) of the gilbert damping @xmath19 of the magnetization motion in the fm .",
    "this also has a characteristic temperature dependence in the spin - incoherent regime . for the case of a sc tunnel",
    "coupled to a sill , we evaluate the ac and dc josephson current in a wire that can be either side - coupled ( bulk - coupled ) or end - coupled to the sc .",
    "we find the dc josephson current suffers an exponential decay in real space due to the incoherence of the spin sector ( in contrast to the inverse length suppression that was found for adiabatically contacted scs@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we show that the ac josephson effect also contains important information about spin - incoherent effects in its voltage and temperature dependence .",

    "this means that we are no longer free to use standard bosonization procedures@xcite for the electron operator because these formulas rely on the assumption that the relevant energy scales on which the system is probed are small compared to both spin and charge energies .    for a strongly interacting system",
    "we require a formalism that applies to all energy scales relative to the spin energy ( and in particular to @xmath21 ) , but only low energy scales to relative to the charge energy .",

    "the general expressions for electron correlation functions obtained in this way provide a launching point for numerical studies in the intermediate ( with respect to spin ) temperature regime @xmath22 , which is not well handled by existing analytical methods .      as is typical of interacting one dimensional electron systems",

    "the basic idea is to represent the electron operator as a product of operators that describe the holons @xmath28 ( spinless fermions that naturally arise in the context of strongly interacting fermions and the spin - incoherent regime@xcite ) and the spin degrees of freedom @xmath29 .",

    "the expression can be physically motivated as follows . from it",
    "is clear that the creation of an electron is also accompanied by the creation of a holon .",

    "this is accomplished by @xmath37 . in general",
    ", one has @xmath38 as the object that adds a new site to the spin chain between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "while this appears physically intuitive , the expression suffers from the drawback that it does not naturally account for the variation of electron density with position in a real electron gas.@xcite matveev , furusaki , and glazman showed@xcite that a remedy for this issue is to define the position at which the spin site is added to the chain in terms of the number of holons to the left of the site , @xmath41 in terms of the electron creation and annihilation operators are defined as @xmath42 the operators given above explicitly account for the fact that the spins are attached to electrons , and the formulas are valid at all energy scales .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that even though the hamiltonian is spin - charge separated , the electron operators are not written as a product of a spin piece and a charge piece because the  spin \" pieces @xmath43 also depend on the electron density via .      in writing eqs .",

    "one of the most important consequences of a finite @xmath88 is an energy - dependent reflection coefficient , which ultimately leads to the proximity effect in the normal material.@xcite in the context of interacting one dimensional systems , andreev boundary conditions have been discussed by a number of authors.@xcite the conclusion of these works is that when a left moving electron with spin @xmath33 is reflected as a right moving hole with the opposite spin there is an energy dependent phase shift @xmath90 ( proportional to the momentum difference @xmath91 with respect to the fermi point)@xcite that multiplies a factor@xcite @xmath92 that encodes the phase @xmath93 of the superconducting order parameter ( assumed non - zero for @xmath94),@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the superconducting coherence length .",

    "a similar situation was considered by bena and balents in the context of a fm - ll junction.@xcite they found that when the magnetization @xmath113 of the fm acquires a time dependence ( perhaps by the application of external fields ) , spin current is pumped into the adjoined ll at the rate @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are temperature dependent parameters depending on the interface tunneling and interactions in the ll . below",
