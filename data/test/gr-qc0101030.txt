    "in the past few years we have seen increasing efforts , both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view , devoted to the measurement , by means of artificial satellites techniques , of certain very small general relativistic effects in the weak gravitational field of the earth .",
    "we refer to the small forces , unknown in classical newtonian mechanics , induced by the rotation of the earth itself on near orbiting bodies ; due to their formal analogy with the magnetic forces generated by electric charge currents they are called  s. among them we recall the dragging of the orbital plane of a point mass and the shift of the pericenter s orbit in its plane , called  ( lense and thirring 1918 ; ciufolini and wheeler 1995 ) , which is presently measured by analyzing the orbits of  and  slr satellites ( ciufolini 2000 ) .    in the  experiment the observable is a suitable combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes @xmath2 of  and  and the  @xmath3 of  ( ciufolini 1996 ) : ^i+c_1^ii+c_2^ii 60.2_lt , in which @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the parameter which must be measured .",
    "it is 1 in  and 0 in newtonian mechanics .",
    "general relativity predicts for the combined residuals a linear trend with a slope of @xmath7 mas / y .",
    "indeed : @xmath8    in order to assess the feasibility of this space - based experiment the error budget is of the utmost importance , in particular with respect to the systematic uncertainties induced by other physical forces acting upon the combined residuals of . among them",
    "the orbital perturbations induced by the earth s solid and ocean tides ( dow 1988 ; christodoulidis et al .",
    "1988 ; casotto 1989 ) are very relevant .",
    "ciufolini claims that is not affected by the @xmath9 part , both statical and dynamical , of the earth s gravitational field .",
    "if confirmed , this feature is very important since the systematic errors of the terrestrial gravitational field which are most relevant for the detection of the  lie just in the first two even zonal harmonics ( ciufolini 1996 ) .    in order to model as more accurately as possible the tidal perturbations on the s and to test quantitatively the independence of the proposed combined residuals of the @xmath9 harmonics a complete analysis of the earth tidal perturbations ( pavlis and iorio 2000 ) on the nodes of lageos and lageos ii and the perigee of",
    "is carried out .",
    "the obtained results are used in assessing the level at which the poor knowledge of the earth s solid and , in particular , ocean tides affects the measurement of @xmath6 by means of .",
    "the tidal perturbations are worked out in the framework of the linear lagrange perturbation theory ( kaula 1966 ) ; since the  is a linear trend , only the long - period perturbations averaged over an orbital revolution are considered .",
    "the investigation of the tidal perturbations involves only the terms of degree @xmath10 for the solid tides and also the terms of degree @xmath11 for the ocean tides . concerning the latter ones ,",
    "only the prograde waves are considered .",
    "the perturbative amplitudes are inversely proportional to the perturbations frequencies . concerning the examined even degree perturbations , the periods depend only on the relative motion , as viewed in a geocentric inertial frame , between the constituent s tidal bulge and the orbital plane . concerning the odd degree ocean tidal perturbations ,",
    "also the perigee s motion must be considered .",
    "so , in general , the spectrum of the orbital tidal perturbations is richer than that of the tides as viewed on the earth surface : often it happens that a constituent which on the earth gives rise to negligible tides induces orbital perturbations with relevant amplitudes and different periods .",
    "in general , as far as the solid and ocean tides constituents whose perturbations are examined here , it must be noted that , for @xmath10 , the ocean perturbative amplitudes amount to at most @xmath12 of the corresponding solid perturbative amplitudes .",
    "the calculations are performed by using for the love numbers @xmath13 the complex , frequency - dependent values released by ( mccarthy 1996 ) , for the equilibrium tidal heights @xmath14 the values released by ( roosbeek 1996 ) and for the ocean tidal heights @xmath15 the coefficients of the recent egm96 model ( lemoine et al 1998 ) .",
    "concerning the solid tides , the most effective constituents turn out to be the semisecular 18.6-year , the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 which induce on the examined s elements perturbations of the order of @xmath18 mas with periods ranging from 111.24 days for the @xmath17 on   to 6798.38 days for the 18.6-year tide .    the latter , with its amplitudes of -1079.38 mas , 1982.16 mas and -1375.58 mas for the nodes of the s and the  of  respectively , could be particularly insidious for the detection of the  .",
    "indeed , since the observational periods adopted until now ( ciufolini 2000 ) range only from 3.1 to 4 years , it could resemble a superimposed linear trend which may alias the recovery of @xmath6 .",
    "however , its effect should vanish since it is a @xmath19 tide , and should be not sensitive to such tides .",
    "this feature will be quantitatively assessed later .",
    "also the @xmath16 can not be neglected : it induces on the  s node a perturbation with a period of 1043.67 days and an amplitude of 1744.38 mas , while the node and the  of  are shifted by an amount of -398 mas and 1982.14 mas , respectively , with a period of -569.21 days .",
    "regarding the ocean tides , whose knowledge is less accurate than that of the solid tides , the @xmath20 part of the tidal spectrum turns out to be very interesting for the  of .    indeed , for this element the @xmath16 @xmath21 terms induce perturbations whose amplitudes and periods are of the same order of magnitude of those generated by the solid tides .",
    "for example , the @xmath22 harmonic has a period of 1851.9 days ( 5.09 years ) and an amplitude of 1136 mas , while the @xmath23 harmonic is less effective : its amplitude amounts to 346.6 mas and its period to -336.28 days .    it should be noted that , contrary to the first two even degree zonal perturbations which do not affect , the diurnal odd degree tidal perturbations are not canceled out by the combined residuals of ciufolini .",
    "so , over an observational period of few years the @xmath24 harmonic may alias the  trend of interest to us .",
    "the even degree ocean tidal perturbations are not particularly relevant : they amount to some tens of mas or less , with the exception of @xmath16 which perturbs the node of  and the  of  at a level of @xmath25 mas .",
    "for a given observational period @xmath26 , the tidal perturbations can be divided between two main categories according to their periods @xmath27 : those with @xmath28 and those with @xmath29 .",
    "the former ones , even if their mismodeled amplitude is great so that they heavily affect the orbital residuals , are not particularly insidious because their effect averages out if @xmath30 .",
    "conversely , the latter ones must be carefully accounted for since they may alias the determination of @xmath6 acting as superimposed bias .",
    "this is particularly true for those diurnal and semidiurnal tides which should affect the combined residuals , like the @xmath31 .",
    "a preliminary analysis has been performed by evaluating the left - hand side of by means of the nominal tidal perturbative amplitudes worked out in the previous sections for @xmath26 = 1 year .",
    "the calculations have been repeated also by means of the mismodeled amplitudes .",
    "they show that , not only the @xmath9 tides tend to cancel out , but also that this feature extends to the @xmath32 ocean tides .",
    "the orbital residuals curve has been simulated with matlab by including the  trend as predicted by , the main mismodeled tidal perturbations : a_f , where @xmath33 denotes the chosen harmonic , and a noise . about the mismodeling @xmath34",
    "we have assumed that the main source of uncertainties are the love number @xmath13 ( mccarthy 1996 ) for the solid tides , the load love numbers ( farrell 1972 ; pagiatakis 1990 ) and the ocean tidal heights @xmath15 ( lemoine et al .",
    "1998 ) for the ocean tides .",
    "it has been decided to build into the matlab routine the capability to vary the time series length @xmath26 , the time span @xmath35 , the amplitude of the noise , and the initial phases @xmath36 of the harmonics .",
    "the so obtained simulated curves , for different choices of @xmath26 , have been subsequently fitted with a least - square routine in order to recover , among the other things , the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this procedure has been repeated with and without the whole set of mismodeled tidal signals so to obtain an estimate @xmath37 of their influence on the measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "this analysis show that @xmath38 for @xmath26 ranging from 4 years to 7 years .",
    "the decision of including the whole set of tides has been motivated by the fact that their least - square fitted parameters show that some of them are strongly correlated with the  trend , in particular for 4 years . for longer time",
    "spans , as it could be expected , the  trend emerges clearly against the background of the tidal noise and also the single harmonics , describing a large number of complete cycles , tend to mutually decorrelate .",
    "first , in a very conservative way , the averaged value of the mismodeled tidal signal under consideration over different @xmath26 has been considered .",
    "the analysis has been performed for the 18.6-year tide and the @xmath24 .",
    "it has been assumed on the semisecular tide a mismodeling level of @xmath39 due to the uncertainty at its frequency in the anelastic behavior of the earth s mantle accounted for by the love number @xmath13 .",
    "the ocean constituent has been considered unknown at a @xmath40 level due to the uncertainties in the load love number of degree @xmath20 and in the tidal height coefficient @xmath15 as released by egm96 . over",
    "different @xmath26 the latter affects the determination of the  effect at a @xmath41 level at most , while the zonal tide , as predicted by ciufolini ( 1996 ) , almost cancels out giving rise to negligible contributions to the combined residuals .",
    "these results have been confirmed fairly well by adopting another method analogous to that employed in ( vespe 1999 ) in assessing the influence of the direct solar radiation pressure s eclipses on the determination of the  .",
    "we take the signal of interest over a given @xmath26 , fit it with a straight line and compare the so obtained slope , in unit of 60.2 mas / y , to @xmath6 .    99 casotto , s. ( 1989 ) : ocean tide models for topex precise orbit determination , ph .",
