    "the single parameter scaling ( sps ) hypothesis@xcite is the foundation of our understanding of anderson localization in disordered systems . according to the sps hypothesis anderson localization phenomena",
    "are governed by a single parameter : the ratio of the system size to the localization length @xmath0 . when applied to the zero temperature conductance @xmath1 of disordered mesoscopic system",
    "the hypothesis implies that the probability distribution @xmath2 of the conductance obeys@xcite @xmath3 here @xmath1 is in units of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the system size .",
    "the sps hypothesis has been applied to other physically interesting quantities including the localization length@xcite and lyapunov exponent spectra@xcite of quasi-1d systems , as well as the energy level statistics of disordered systems.@xcite the probability distribution of all these quantities should have a form similar to eq.(1 ) if sps holds .",
    "our understanding of scaling is most complete for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "there are two properties of 1d systems that distinguish them from higher dimensional systems .",
    "first , their electronic eigenstates are , with very few exceptions , always localized .",
    "second , the localization length @xmath0 is comparable to the mean free path so that there is no diffusive regime . it has been shown that , in 1d , the cumulants of @xmath6 all scale linearly with length @xmath5.@xcite it follows that @xmath2 is log - normal when @xmath7.@xcite the log - normal distribution is determined by two parameters , the mean and variance of @xmath6 . consistency with the sps hypothesis requires that they be related . for weak disorder a perturbative analysis of the 1d anderson model reveals@xcite @xmath8 angular brackets mean an average over disorder . for the 1d anderson model ,",
    "only weak disorder is relevant since for strong disorder @xmath0 is comparable to the lattice spacing",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : sps1dg ] ) holds for many models .",
    "the precise conditions for its validity is@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a length scale that is related to the integrated density of states .",
    "sps is violated at the boundaries of the original spectrum of the system and for fluctuation states arising due to disorder in the initial band gaps .",
    "a violation@xcite of sps at the band center of the anderson model was shown in ref . to arise for similar reasons .",
    "single parameter scaling of the conductance distribution ( eq.([eq : spspofg ] ) ) has also been verified numerically in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) anderson model close to the critical point of the anderson transition.@xcite the region of validity of the scaling in 3d , however , is not known .",
    "one can imagine , however , that an inequality similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : spscondition ] ) may be applicable in this case as well .",
    "the situation in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems is currently very controversial . according to ref .",
    "all states in 2d are localized . at the same time",
    "there are a large number of experiments , in which an apparent metal - insulator transition has been observed .",
    "( for a recent review see ref . ) .",
    "the physical meaning of these observation is not yet understood , despite a debate that has already lasted a decade .",
    "the validity , or otherwise , of sps in 2d is , therefore , an important issue . even for single particle models",
    "this issue has not yet been fully resolved .",
    "for instance , careful numerical analyses@xcite of the 2d anderson model showed excellent agreement with sps . while other studies@xcite suggested the existence of power - law localized states and two - parameter scaling .",
    "violations of sps have also been reported in more recent papers.@xcite    the example of 1d systems demonstrates that conclusive results regarding scaling properties can only be obtained from studying the distribution functions of relevant quantities .",
    "numerical studies@xcite in 2d show that @xmath6 is normally distributed in the regime of strong localization .",
    "it follows that single parameter scaling must be manifest in a relation between the average of @xmath6 , and its variance , similar to the 1d equation ( [ eq : sps1dg ] ) .",
    "however , attempts to verify this relation did not reach definite conclusions because of the small system sizes simulated and an approach to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sps1dg ] ) that was too naive .",
    "the main objective of our paper is to perform a careful analysis of the statistical properties of a 2d disordered system of non - interacting electrons , and verify that they are consistent with sps .",
    "the object of our calculations is the finite length lyapunov exponent ( le ) for a 2d anderson model with diagonal disorder .",
    "( the definition of the le and the meaning of the qualification _ finite length _ is given below . ) for a 2d @xmath11 system with @xmath7 the mean of the le is equal to the inverse of the localization length @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of conductance has been given special attention in the literature because it is directly accessible in experiments .",
    "however , it should be understood that the conductance unavoidably reflects properties not only of the system in question , but also properties of the contacts used to measure it .",
    "the lyapunov exponent , on the other hand , is an intrinsic property of the disordered system , containing information about spatial distribution of the wave functions , which are ultimately responsible for all other properties including conductance .",
    "we find that the distribution function of the le is approximately normal both when @xmath12 and when @xmath7 .",
    "this contrasts with the conductance which exhibits not only very strong fluctuations but also a significant change in the form of its distribution between the diffusive and localized regimes .",
    "we approach the question of scaling by clarifying the relation between the average and variance of the le that is implied by the sps hypothesis in 2d , and checking whether numerical data are consistent with it .",
    "we find that the relation between the mean and variance is characterized by a single parameter , namely the ratio of the system size to the localization length .",
    "thus , we provide convincing evidence that the sps hypothesis is valid in 2d disordered systems of non - interacting electrons .",
    "we simulated the two dimensional anderson model with hamiltonian @xmath13 the first summation is over all sites on an @xmath14 square lattice i.e. a system of width @xmath15 and length @xmath5 .",
    "the second summation is over all pairs of nearest neighbors .",

    "the finite length les are random variables that fluctuate as we sample the random potential . for fixed @xmath15 , when @xmath36 the les always tend to the same limiting values @xmath37 for ( nearly ) all samplings of the distribution of transfer matrices and ( nearly ) any choice of @xmath27.@xcite    the @xmath38 le is the most physically significant :",

    ", the value of @xmath46 depends only on the distribution of the transfer matrix @xmath48 , and is independent of the choice of the initial matrix @xmath27 . for finite @xmath5 , however , the distribution of @xmath46 depends on @xmath27 and @xmath5 , in addition to @xmath48 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath27 would , if not dealt with , introduce an arbitrary element to our analysis that is undesirable .    to remove the dependence of the distribution of @xmath46 on @xmath27 we used the following observation to our advantage . for ( almost )",

    "we obtain a distribution for @xmath46 that depends only on @xmath5 and @xmath48 .",
    "to generate matrices with the required stationary distribution @xmath49 , we took an arbitrary set of orthonormal vectors , performed @xmath50 transfer matrix multiplications and factored the result according to eq .",

    "the test showed that once @xmath52 , the distribution of the le becomes independent of @xmath50 .",
    "below we set @xmath53 .",
    "since our interest in this paper is in the distribution of the le in 2d systems we set the width @xmath15 and length @xmath5 of the system equal @xmath54 i.e. in the remainder of the paper we consider only 2d @xmath11 systems .",

[ f1 ] , the difference of the skewness from zero is not statistically significant .",
