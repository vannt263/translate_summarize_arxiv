    "entanglement plays an important role in both quantum foundations and quantum information .",
    "recently however , an overlap between these two fields has emerged which goes beyond this somewhat obvious reason for common interest .",
    "for instance , there is mounting evidence that contextuality plays a role in any enhancement of quantum over classical communication protocols @xcite .",
    "a second example is work on the `` _ _ r - p _ _ '' framework for analyzing the information processing power of general ( not necessarily quantum ) probabilistic theories @xcite - a body of work to which this paper is closely related .",
    "finally we mention work by one of us @xcite showing that one particular class of ontological models @xcite ( or ` hidden variable theories ' ) of quantum mechanics has a computational power slightly greater than that of regular quantum computation ( if access to values of the hidden variables is granted ) .    as in this last example",
    ", we will be considering ontological models .",
    "such models reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics by using ( positive , normalized ) probability distributions over a space of ( sometimes , though not always , hidden ) variables to describe the state of a system . unlike quantum states in operational quantum mechanics ,",
    "these variables are presumed to correspond directly to `` properties of reality '' in some fashion - hence we term the variables the _",
    "ontic states_. measurements in these models are described by positive valued _ indicator functions _ - functions which simply determine the probability of a system in a given ontic state yielding the particular measurement outcome associated with that indicator function . in this way",
    "ontological models differ from the many well known quasi - probabilty representations of quantum mechanics . in those representations ,",
    "even if the states are represented by positive , normalized probability distributions ( e.g. the q - function ) , the measurements will be represented by indicator functions which can be negative ( or greater than 1 ) .",
    "such negativity is difficult to interpret if one is interested in describing properties of a reality underpinning quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact spekkens has shown that such negativity arises in these representations precisely because they are assumed non - contextual @xcite .",
    "in particular , this assumption of non - contextuality is made in the work on the _ r - p _ formalism mentioned above , and is the reason the @xmath0-vectors ( those vectors associated with measurements ) generally have to contain negative elements .",
    "similar considerations apply to the work on discrete wigner distributions @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the ontological model framework was undertaken in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we will not need the majority of the formalism developed in that paper .",
    "however , let us mention in passing a few of the conclusions from it .",
    "firstly , there exist a wide variety of ontological models , both deterministic and indeterministic , including ones which , unlike the examples given in @xcite , do not provide greater computational power than that of regular quantum computation . secondly",
    ", for some models it is necessary to consider not just ontic states of the system under consideration , but also those of the preparation and measurement devices .",
    "thirdly , the manner in which such models exhibit contextuality is varied , but one feature ( which in some sense subsumes contextuality ) that is common to all models is a property we term _",
    "deficiency_. loosely speaking , deficiency breaks a symmetry between preparations and measurements in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is the property that the set of ontic states which a system prepared in quantum state @xmath1 may _ actually _ be in , is strictly smaller than the set of ontic states which would reveal the measurement outcome @xmath2 with certainty .    in this paper",
    ", we initiate an investigation into how ontological models can be used to reproduce quantum mechanical statistical predictions for a discrete set of preparations of , and measurements upon , a given system .",
    "we start in section [ sec : data_tables ] by discussing a method of representing empirical data in matrix form . in section [ ofs ]",
    "we then introduce a matrix factorization of this data , equivalent to an ontological model over a finite number of ontic states . in sections",
    "[ sec : model1 ] , [ sec : model2 ] and [ sec : model3 ] we present three factorizations which can describe any such empirical data .",
    "we then discuss in section [ detfromindet ] how to turn an indeterministic ontological model into a deterministic one .",
    "this raises the issue of how such models manifest the necessary contextuality , and in section [ sec : contextuality ] we discuss this and provide an explicit example .    in the second half of the paper , section [ oc ]",
    ", we consider the issue of finding ontological models with as few ontic states as possible - a topic with potential application to the classical simulation of quantum systems .",
    "we begin with a common @xcite , although somewhat idealistic , formalization of the process of performing an experiment resulting in probabilistic data - data for which we then seek an explanation .",
    "the experiment consists of a set of preparation procedures , and a set of measurement procedures .",
    "the preparation procedures are defined in terms of different macroscopic ( and therefore distinguishable ) configurations ( settings ) of an apparatus , and these are labeled @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 standing for `` states '' ) .",
    "likewise the different measurement procedures are macroscopically distinguishable , and can be labeled @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "each measurement procedure has some number @xmath8 of outcomes , which , by padding with null outcomes if necessary , we take to be the same for each .",
    "we can then label the occurrence of the @xmath9 outcome , when the measurement procedure is @xmath6 , as @xmath10 .",
    "we imagine that a large number of experiments are performed , and the probabilities that a given preparation yields a given measurement outcome estimated and tabulated , e.g : @xmath11.\\end{array}\\ ] ] in this example @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so that there are @xmath15 rows in the matrix .",
    "the sum of every @xmath8 elements within each column must be 1 , since one of the outcomes must obtain for every measurement . for clarity we have drawn a horizontal line underscoring the separation between distinct measurements .",
    "we will call such a matrix of values a data table , and generally denote it @xmath16",
    ". it will often be convenient to consider @xmath16 a three - dimensional array , where the particular measurement being performed lies along the third dimension . for the above example we can do so by defining @xmath17\\end{array},\\\\ d^{(2)}&= & \\begin{array}{r@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}l } & \\begin{array}{ccccc } & \\:\\:\\:\\mathcal{p}^{(1 ) } & \\mathcal{p}^{(2 ) } & \\mathcal{p}^{(3 ) } & \\mathcal{p}^{(4 ) } \\\\",

    "\\:\\:\\\\ 0.05 \\:\\ : & 0.06 \\:\\ : & ... \\:\\ : & ... \\:\\:\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\end{array}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more generally the data table can be taken as specified in terms of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "now in quantum mechanics we generally associate a density matrix @xmath22 with a preparation @xmath23 , and a povm element @xmath24 with a measurement outcome @xmath25 .",
    "since we will frequently be considering data tables for which the table entries are presumed to be given by quantum mechanical expectations - i.e. @xmath26 , it is often convenient to label the rows and columns via the appropriate quantum operators .",
    "in fact , we will almost always only be considering procedures which correspond to pure quantum states @xmath27 and to sets of sharp ( projective ) measurements @xmath28 ( also known as pvm s ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath29 and it will be convenient to adopt a more quantum notation along the lines of : @xmath30.\\end{array}\\ ] ] at this stage it is pertinent to consider the following :    [ prop1 ] every possible data table can be realized via standard quantum expectation values of projective measurements on pure states .    at first sight",
    "this proposition may appear incorrect .",
    "consider , for example , the following data table : @xmath31.\\end{array}\\ ] ] as there are two possible outcomes for each measurement , one might surmise that the data was generated by sharp measurements on a qu**b**it prepared in either @xmath32 or @xmath33 . in that case",
    "the table is clearly impossible - the first measurement implies the two states are orthogonal , and the second implies there is a two outcome measurement which yields one of the states with certainty , but which is unbiased with respect to the second state .",
    "however , consider if the system was quantum mechanically actually a three dimensional qu**tr**it with basis states @xmath34 . in this case",
    "it is easy to verify that choosing @xmath35 , the two sets of measurements could be @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "that is , the states are sharp and the measurements are projective .",
    "the point is that there is no way of determining from the raw data table itself any presumed ( quantum ) hilbert space dimension of the systems under investigation .",
    "we will use the general notation @xmath39 to denote the hilbert space dimension of such a quantum representation of a data table - for this example @xmath40 .",
    "proposition  1 asserts that _ every _ data table can be so constructed - that is , by pure quantum states and projective operators .",
    "that this is possible can be seen as follows .",
    "since we are not restricted in @xmath39 , let us imagine that every preparation procedure ( column of the data table ) is represented by a state which is orthogonal to all the other states .",
    "that is , each state lies in its own subspace of the total hilbert space . clearly , if we can choose measurements so as to reproduce any desired statistics for one such state then , since the states are all orthogonal , we can piece together measurement operators for the different states in a direct sum to produce suitable measurement operators for the whole table .",
    "focussing on one state then , imagine the measurement under consideration has outcomes occurring with probabilities @xmath41 .",
    "all we need to establish is that , for a given @xmath1 , there is a way of choosing projection operators such that @xmath42 .",
    "one way of constructing suitable operators is to work in the basis where @xmath43^t$ ] .",
    "let @xmath44 be the row vector @xmath45 $ ] , and construct the unitary matrix which has @xmath44 as its first row and the remaining @xmath46 rows any orthogonal basis of the support of @xmath47 .",
    "then the columns of this unitary matrix form a set of orthogonal states , and projectors onto these states satisfy @xmath42 .",
    "this procedure is extremely wasteful in terms of @xmath39 , the hilbert space dimension used to represent generic data .",
    "this raises the following :    [ hilbspacedim ] is there an efficient procedure for finding the smallest hilbert space dimension required to represent an arbitrary data table in terms of pure states and projective measurements ?",
    "although we do not have an answer to this problem , we note that being able to solve it would allow one to ( approximately ) solve a quantum one way communication complexity problem .",
    "thus open problem 1 may benefit from studies in this field . to see the relation , note that by sending @xmath48 copies of systems prepared according to a procedure @xmath3 , a party alice can have another party",
    "bob estimate the probability of the @xmath49 outcome of some measurement @xmath50 occurring .",
    "the fixed accuracy of bob s estimation is determined by the size of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , if the systems realizing the preparations and measurements consist of @xmath51 qubits then alice needs to send bob @xmath52 qubits for him to obtain his estimation of the desired probability .",
    "but suppose that we consider @xmath3 and @xmath50 to be specified by binary strings @xmath53 and @xmath54 and denote the probability that bob is attempting to estimate by @xmath55 .",
    "then requiring bob to perform the estimation of @xmath55 with alice sending as few qubits as possible is a quantum one way communication complexity problem .",
    "thus the efficient procedure required by open problem 1 would allow us to minimize @xmath51 and thus ( given that @xmath48 is a constant overhead determined only by the accuracy of bob s estimation ) allow us to solve the associated quantum one way communication complexity problem .",
    "the lesson of proposition [ prop1 ] is that , at its most basic level , the probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics is without physical content . to obtain such content extra assumptions or restrictions",
    "must be imposed .",
    "for example , assuming that measurements on distinct systems are described by separable ( tensor products of ) projection operators , the hilbert space structure we build to yield @xmath16 can not be guaranteed to reproduce all possible _ correlated _ probability distributions between multiple systems .",
    "these precautions are well known but bear repeating , because in this paper we will be looking at representing a data table via a different probabilistic formalism , a formalism essentially that of classical probability theory .",
    "it is well understood that the ontological model formalism allows for an arbitrary data table to be represented - therefore our goal is to investigate more than simply whether such models can reproduce empirical observations .",
    "in fact we are primarily interested in using these models to obtain a deeper understanding of the restrictions which occur on any proposed realistic explanation for quantum mechanics . as such we will be looking at the structure of such models when they are used to model data tables corresponding to hypothetical experiments which in quantum mechanics would be described by pure state preparations and rank one projective measurements on a system of a known hilbert space dimension .",
    "therefore we will generally have the case that @xmath56 , and open problem [ hilbspacedim ] will not be of concern to us .",
    "our primary goal is to examine factorizations of the data matrix @xmath57 , @xmath19 into the product of a @xmath58 _ measurement matrix _ @xmath59 and an @xmath60 _ preparation matrix _ @xmath61 ( both positive - real valued ) : @xmath62    the columns of the preparation matrix @xmath61 are normalized probability distributions i.e. @xmath61 is column - stochastic ; it satisfies @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath61 is that its @xmath9 column is a ( classical ) probability distribution , over @xmath66 distinct _ ontic states _ , which corresponds to the preparation procedure @xmath23 of @xmath16 .",
    "that is , we imagine that when a system is prepared according to @xmath23 , it really is prepared in one of the @xmath66 ontic states , and our ignorance of which particular ontic state the system is in is represented by the probability distribution in column @xmath67 of @xmath61 .",
    "each row of the measurement matrix corresponds to an _ indicator function _ over the @xmath66 ontic states .",
    "that is , @xmath68 is the probability of obtaining measurement outcome @xmath69 , if the actual ontic state of the system is @xmath65 , given that measurement @xmath70 is being performed .    besides ( [ mpequalsd ] ) there is one extra constraint on @xmath71 , due to our desire to be able to interpret an ontological factorization as a model of the probabilistic data arising from a realistic framework .",
    "specifically , regardless of which ontic state a system is in , one of the measurement outcomes _ must _ pertain .",
    "for instance , if we consider the @xmath72 measurement performed on a system actually in ontic state @xmath65 , then one of the @xmath8 outcomes must occur .",
    "as such , we need ,    @xmath73    for each of the @xmath74 . thus the @xmath59 are also necessarily column - stochastic .",
    "this is actually an important extra constraint - without it one can reproduce quantum statistics with non - contextual ontological models not having negative indicator functions - which has been shown not to be possible by spekkens @xcite .",
    "( they would have a decidedly weird ontology however , as they would require a strange non - separable conspiracy between preparation and measurement devices . )    with the above constraints in mind , we can define an ontological factorization more formally as :    a data table @xmath16 possesses an ontological factorization ( of ) over @xmath66 ontic states if there exists an @xmath60 , column - stochastic matrix @xmath61 , and @xmath8 matrices @xmath59 , each @xmath75 dimensional and column - stochastic , which satisfy @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "[ def : of ]    if the entries of @xmath71 are all 0 or 1 , then the ontological factorization is deterministic , otherwise it is indeterministic .",
    "we now briefly present a trivial of , which is easily performed for any data table .",
    "this will be rendered much less trivial in subsection [ detfromindet ] .",
    "specifically , in this of of the data table @xmath16 we choose @xmath78 this of has @xmath79 .",
    "that is , the number of ontic states is equal to the number of preparation procedures ( quantum states ) used in constructing the data table . in terms of an ontological model ,",
    "this of implies that preparing a system in a quantum state @xmath80 is equivalent to preparing the system in a single ( determined ) ontic state ( since each column of @xmath61 has only one non - zero entry ) . in the terminology of @xcite",
    "this model is @xmath81-ontic ( and @xmath81-complete ) .",
    "measurements in this model are represented by indeterministic indicator functions - the model simply specifies what the probability is that a system in a given ontic state yields each outcome of any specified measurement .",
    "this ontological model , when extrapolated to a `` continuum limit '' ( i.e. constructed for a data table of _ all _ measurements and preparation procedures for a quantum system of some fixed hilbert space dimension ) , becomes the model of beltrammati - bugajski @xcite , which was presented as example number @xmath82 in @xcite . in that model",
    "the ontological state space is simply the complex projective space , the quantum state is represented by a dirac delta function distribution , and the indicator functions over the space are indeterministic , with probabilistic weights defined by the born rule .",
    "model 1 formally encapsulates the commonly expressed viewpoint that the quantum state _ is _ the state of reality .",
    "we now turn to a deterministic of which can be constructed for any data table .",
    "this of has @xmath83 ontic states .",
    "it is convenient to index the ontic states ( that is , the rows of @xmath61 and columns of @xmath71 ) by an @xmath84-tuple of integers of the form @xmath85 where each of the @xmath86 ranges over @xmath87 .",
    "we then assign probabilities over the ontic states to create @xmath61 as follows : @xmath88 alternatively we could specify that the @xmath9 column of @xmath61 , denoted @xmath89 , is formed from the @xmath9 column of @xmath16 as follows:@xmath90    consider summing over index @xmath91 : @xmath92 since @xmath93 is column - stochastic .",
    "we see that in general summing over an index simply removes all terms from the product which contain that index .",
    "summing over all row indices @xmath86 in this way we confirm that @xmath61 is column - stochastic as required .",
    "we now consider how to construct row @xmath69 of @xmath59 , which corresponds to the indicator function for @xmath94 .",
    "we assign the value 1 to every entry in this row for which the column index @xmath85 has @xmath95 . more formally , @xmath96 to see that this works as desired , take , for example , @xmath97 , so we are dealing with the first row of @xmath59 .",
    "we compute the inner product of this row with the matrix @xmath61 : @xmath98 where we have used the observation in eq .",
    "( [ peqn ] ) multiple times .",
    "thus we see that we reproduce the required statistics of the data table .",
    "an example may help illustrate the idea .",
    "consider the following data table with @xmath14 and @xmath13 : @xmath99.\\ ] ] following the construction above , the matrices @xmath71 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath100    there are two points to make about this model .",
    "firstly , unlike model 1 , the columns of the matrix @xmath61 from model 2 are not orthogonal ( disjoint ) .",
    "that is , the probability distributions corresponding to non - orthogonal states overlap .",
    "such models are called @xmath81-epistemic in @xcite . in such models , knowing the ontic state of the system does not allow one to infer with certainty what quantum state would describe the same preparation .",
    "unfortunately , this is only true in the case of a finite data table , @xmath101 . in the continuum limit of this model , the probability distributions of non",
    "- orthogonal states become disjoint . to prove this",
    "rigorously requires a diversion into the infinite tensor product structures first considered by von neumann @xcite , and we will not do so here .",
    "we point out , however , that even though it is @xmath81-ontic in the continuum limit , it is not , in the terminology of @xcite , @xmath81-complete .",
    "( a @xmath81-complete model would have only one ontic state consistent with any given quantum state . )",
    "finding models which are @xmath81-epistemic in the continuum limit is not easy , some attempts were given in @xcite , and we believe barrett has made some recent progress @xcite . because there is a continuum of quantum states , one way to ensure an ontological model representation of all states and measurements in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath39 is @xmath81-epistemic is simply to find a model which makes use of only a finite number of ontic states .",
    "hardy @xcite has shown that this is not possible - as the number of states and measurements increases , the number of ontic states must increase .",
    "however , hardy s analysis relies only on the fact that we must be able to divide the ontic state space into disjoint sets ( to represent orthogonal measurements ) , and that as we go to the continuum limit there are an infinite number of orthogonal measurements that need to be represented in this manner . or those yielding outcome @xmath102 ( i.e. deficiency ) . however these are easily incorporated and the conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "] now the number of ways of dividing @xmath66 ontic states into disjoint sets grows exponentially .",
    "it would therefore seem that the possibility remains open that the number of ontic states required for an indeterministic model might grow only _ logarithmically _ as the size of the data table .",
    "but in fact this is not possible . to see this ,",
    "consider the simplest case of of s of data tables having @xmath103 , which we can show must satisfy the tight bound @xmath104 .",
    "clearly models 1 and 2 set an upper bound of @xmath105 on the required number of ontic states , by providing deterministic and indeterministic factorizations having @xmath79 and @xmath106 respectively . to give the tight bound claimed ,",
    "it remains to show that for given @xmath5 and @xmath84 there always exists a data table requiring an ontological factorization having @xmath107 if @xmath108 or @xmath109 if @xmath110 .",
    "we will give a general construction for a data table that lower bounds @xmath66 and then show how it applies in the case of each of these inequalities between @xmath5 and @xmath84 .",
    "first note that we can write the data tables we consider as including only the probabilities for the first outcome of each measurement ( since @xmath103 the probabilities of the second outcomes are then trivially determined ) .",
    "thus we can consider a data table with some parameters @xmath111 and @xmath112 having columns made up from all @xmath111-bit binary strings .",
    "for example , if @xmath113 and @xmath114 then the data table thus constructed would be ,    @xmath115 .",
    "\\end{array } \\label{table_upper_bound}\\ ] ]    but an of of any data table of this form must employ at least @xmath116 ontic states .",
    "this follows since the outcomes of measurements @xmath117 and @xmath118 are completely determined given any of the @xmath119 preparations shown ( i.e. the relevant entries of @xmath16 are all @xmath120 ) ; therefore any ontic states in the supports of these preparations ( i.e. assigned a non - zero value in the relevant column of an of s @xmath61 matrix ) must be deterministic ( take @xmath120 values ) with respect to these three measurements .",
    "thus in the example given in ( [ table_upper_bound ] ) , we must use at least @xmath119 ontic states to deal with the @xmath119 distinct possibilities for assigning outcomes to @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "clearly , by the same reasoning , such a data table constructed with @xmath116 preparations will require @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , any data tables having general parameters @xmath5 and @xmath84 and containing _ sub_-tables of the form ( [ table_upper_bound ] ) will require ofs with at least @xmath116 ontic states .",
    "thus it only remains to determine the largest such sub - table - i.e. largest value of @xmath111 - that can fit in data tables with parameters subjected to each of the constraints @xmath108 and @xmath125 .",
    "if we have @xmath108 then we can find a sub - table of the form ( [ table_upper_bound ] ) having @xmath126 and @xmath127 , giving @xmath128 .",
    "if however , @xmath125 , then the largest sub - table of the form ( [ table_upper_bound ] ) that we can find will have @xmath129 and @xmath127 , yielding @xmath130 .",
    "thus in both cases the lower bound @xmath131 holds .",
    "combining this with the trivial upper bound provided by models 1 and 2 gives the tight bound @xmath104 , showing that as the size of a data table is increased , the number of ontic states must grow faster than a logarithmic dependence on the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath84 .",
    "the general question of how many ontic states are required to represent any particular _ given _ data table is taken up in section iv .",
    "the second point to make about model 2 is that the number of ontic states grows exponentially with the number of measurements being performed .",
    "however , this need not always be the case , as can be seen for models in which @xmath66 depends on @xmath84 by invoking caratheodory s theorem to yield a lower bound on @xmath66 . ) , and that the entries of @xmath16 are generated by convex combinations of these strings ( with coefficients given by the columns of @xmath61 ) .",
    "] in the next section we explicitly demonstrate such a lower bound by introducing our final model ; a deterministic ontological factorization having @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath108 . but note that in this case we have @xmath133 . ]      our final ontological factorization is tailored to employ a number of ontic states that does not increase exponentially with the number of measurements to be described .",
    "this model is best illustrated by an example of its construction .",
    "consider the data table from ( [ model2d ] ) ( the method we outline is trivially adapted to an arbitrary data table ) .",
    "we deal with each column of @xmath16 separately .",
    "suppose that we are attempting to reproduce the second column of @xmath16 , corresponding to some preparation procedure @xmath135 ;    @xmath136\\ ] ]    we begin by finding the smallest entry in the chosen column , which in this case takes a value of @xmath137 , and is associated with the second outcome of the first measurement .",
    "we then move this entry into another column vector , to be added to what remains of the original .",
    "we also remove the same value of @xmath137 from one of the second column entries associated with the remaining measurement - restricting our choice only to ensure that the chosen entry is greater than @xmath137 . referring to the second column of @xmath16 shown above",
    ", we see that there are two such entries to choose from , associated with the first and second outcomes of the second measurement and both taking the value @xmath138 .",
    "we choose the entry associated with the first outcome , and thus obtain ; @xmath136 \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{3}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{2}{3 } \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline \\frac{1}{6 } \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{2 } \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] the new binary column vector we have generated provides a valid set of deterministic measurement outcomes for an ontic state ( weighted by @xmath137 ) .",
    "in particular , note that by subtracting the same value from a single entry associated with each measurement we have ensured that the binary vector satisfies the stochasticity requirement of ( [ stochasticitym_constraint ] ) .",
    "we can repeatedly apply this procedure to the ` remainder ' vector @xmath139 $ ] on the right hand side of the above expression , until only column vectors with binary entries remain .",
    "this gives ;    @xmath140 & \\rightarrow & \\frac{1}{3}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{2}{3 } \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline \\frac{1}{6 } \\\\ \\frac{1}{2 } \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\rightarrow & \\frac{1}{3}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\frac{1}{6}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{1}{2 } \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2 } \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{3}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\frac{1}{6}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\\\hline 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the three @xmath120 vectors generated by this procedure can be used as valid columns of an @xmath71 matrix , and we can take the associated probabilistic weightings to form a @xmath61 matrix row corresponding to the preparation @xmath135 .",
    "thus by introducing three ontic states we have formed @xmath61 and @xmath71 matrices that can reproduce the the quantum statistics for all measurements from @xmath16 performed on the single preparation @xmath135 . repeating this process to introduce a new set of ontic states for the remaining column of @xmath61 ( corresponding to a preparation @xmath141 ) , yields the following deterministic ontological factorization ,      note that since we introduce a whole new set of ontic states for each preparation , the entries of different columns of our @xmath61 matrix are bound to be completely disjoint .",
    "thus , following the terminology of @xcite , model 3 can be classified as @xmath81-ontic .",
    "the procedure outlined above will generally require introducing @xmath143 ontic states for each preparation from @xmath16 , which suggests @xmath144 .",
    "however , model 3 often allows us to exceed this value , so long as the procedure is applied carefully , exploiting repeated entries in @xmath16 to reduce the number of ontic states we need to introduce . by this token",
    "the example given above has @xmath145 - almost half of @xmath146 .      in this section",
    "we will examine a process for turning the indeterministic of of model 1 into a deterministic of .",
    "first a point of notation : from now on we will often use the two dimensional array versions of the data table and measurement matrices : @xmath147,\\;\\;\\;m=\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } m^{(1 ) } \\\\\\hline \\vdots \\\\\\hline m^{(m ) } \\\\ \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] so that the of becomes simply @xmath148 .    the simplest version of the procedure we outline for recovering determinism from indeterminism is most easily illustrated by an example .",
    "consider the following data table : @xmath149.\\ ] ] the of of model 1 would have @xmath150 and @xmath151 that is , @xmath152 .",
    "the first step is to notice that each of the probabilities in the first column of @xmath16 is an integer multiple of @xmath153 , while each in the second column is an integer multiple of @xmath154 .",
    "we therefore expand the supports of the probability distributions in @xmath61 from single ontic states to 4 and 3 ontic states respectively : @xmath155 note that the probability distributions are still disjoint ( in the language of @xcite the model is @xmath81-ontic but not @xmath81-complete ) .",
    "we now want to choose a matrix @xmath71 with only 0/1 entries .",
    "if we choose the first row of @xmath71 ( i.e. the indicator function for the first measurement outcome ) to be @xmath156 then we will certainly produce the first row of @xmath16 .",
    "the key is that the disjointness of the two columns of @xmath61 enables us to assign 1 s and 0 s to @xmath71 s first row in an essentially unrestricted fashion - the first 4 elements of this row simply need to pick up enough @xmath153 s from @xmath61 to give the entry 1/2 for @xmath157 , and similarly the last three entries must pick up an appropriate number of the 1/3 s to give the entry 2/3 for @xmath158 . assigning the second row we need to be more careful .",
    "one assignment which naively would seem to work , in as much as it would reproduce the data table entries when multiplied by @xmath61 , is @xmath159 however this violates the constraint of column - stochasticity on the @xmath59 s from definition [ def : of ] .",
    "such an indicator function would imply that a system in ontic state 1 gives both the first measurement outcome and the second outcome with certainty ! the only choice for this row",
    "once we have chosen the first row as above is @xmath160 proceeding in this manner , one possibility for @xmath71 is @xmath161    imagine now that the data table only contains rational fractions as entries .",
    "this would certainly be the case if we were considering a table which was assembled from actual experimental data .",
    "clearly , generalizing the above procedure will allow us to find @xmath71 and @xmath61 matrices so as to obtain a deterministic of .",
    "this does not give us a procedure for obtaining a finite of for _ any _ data table however , since we may wish to consider ones constructed from quantum states and projectors which have irrational valued overlaps .",
    "for the general program of research into ontological models there is no requirement of finiteness - in particular the trick of spreading the support of the probability distribution over extra ontic states can readily be performed by spreading the distribution over variables of cardinality @xmath162 .",
    "this yields a procedure for transforming any indeterministic ontological model into a deterministic one - and is essentially what bell did @xcite ( see example 4 in @xcite ) to provide a counterexample to ` von - neumann s silly assumption ' . in doing",
    "so one has increased the number of ontic states required to describe the system - the extent to which this is necessary , as opposed to merely sufficient , is an interesting question , which to some extent we take up again in section [ oc ] .    , @xmath163 , @xmath153 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "the blue lines separate different 4-outcome pvms . ]    in the last four sections we have derived a series of bounds on the number of ontic states that ontological factorizations must employ . by a simple extension of the argument given in sec .",
    "[ sec : model2 ] we have that data tables with arbitrary parameters @xmath165 require a number of ontic states that is tightly bounded by @xmath166",
    ". however , the explicit construction that we gave in sec .  [ sec : model3 ] showed that by letting @xmath66 depend on all three parameters of a data table , the number of ontic states need not depend exponentially on @xmath84 .",
    "these bounds clearly have interesting repercussions for the ability to classically simulate quantum systems efficiently .",
    "for example , our lower bound @xmath167 shows that one can not precisely reproduce a general data tables quantum statistics by keeping track of a number of ontic states that grows only logarithmically with the number of preparations and measurements considered .",
    "extending and refining the bounds we have presented is an interesting direction for future research , which may benefit from existing results in the literature .",
    "for example , aaronson has shown in @xcite that the probabilities for a set of @xmath84 two - outcome measurements performed on an @xmath168 dimensional quantum system can be approximately calculated ( to some fixed accuracy ) from a classical string of length @xmath169 .",
    "this shows that a data table containing @xmath84 such measurements and some set of preparations associated with an @xmath168 dimensional quantum system has an _ approximate _ ontological factorization that employs @xmath170 ontic states ( wherein each ontic state encodes a possible instance of the string one can construct to encode the required statistics ) .",
    "thus , in cases where one is satisfied with _",
    "approximately _ reproducing the entries of a data table , the results in @xcite give a lower bound on @xmath66 which depends pseudo - polynomially on @xmath84 and @xmath168 , but interestingly not on @xmath5 ( the precise number of preparations in the data table ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : matrix_connection ] we will also note how existing results concerning matrix factorization problems might prove useful in deriving more bounds on @xmath66 .          by the famous result of kochen and specker @xcite deterministic ontological models",
    "must be measurement - outcome contextual .",
    "we now consider how measurement outcome contextuality manifests itself in an of of a data table .",
    "contextuality needs to be considered when different quantum measurements share a common projector .",
    "in such a case a data table might look something like ( with @xmath14 ) : @xmath171 rows 1 and 4 contain the same entries , and so in quantum mechanics they could correspond to measurement outcomes represented by the same projector .",
    "initially one might have been tempted to simply exclude the redundant rows .",
    "the essence of the kochen - specker theorem is that doing so would prevent us being able to explain the data table in terms of a deterministic ontological model , and so we retain them .",
    "it is at this point that we depart from the _ r - p _ formalism . in the _ r - p _ formalism",
    "there is a unique @xmath0-vector for each quantum projector . as mentioned above , this presumption of measurement outcome non - contextuality is the reason the @xmath0-vectors require negative entries ( or entries greater than 1 ) .    in terms of our of s ,",
    "the contextuality required by the kochen - specker theorem manifests itself as follows :",
    "if two rows of the data table are identical , then one can not necessarily find an of such that the two corresponding rows of @xmath71 are identical .",
    "now , if the only constraint on the factorization was that @xmath148 with @xmath71 a @xmath120 matrix , then this would _ not _ be true , since there would be nothing stopping the replacement of one of those rows of @xmath71 by the other .",
    "the key issue , as mentioned above , is the extra column - stochasticity constraint on the factorization , which forces at least one measurement outcome to be obtained for any given ontic state .",
    "let us demonstrate all this with an example .",
    "in @xcite kernaghan provided an example of a set of measurements in a 4 dimensional hilbert space for which a kochen - specker obstruction exists ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements are built from the following 20 states in a hilbert space of dimension 4 ( the normalization factors of @xmath172 or @xmath163 are omitted , and @xmath173 denotes @xmath174 ) : @xmath175    so , for example , the third measurement @xmath176 consists of the projectors @xmath177 . the proof that these projectors can not be assigned a unique truth value ( i.e. independent of the other projectors in the measurement ) is trivial . in each of the odd number ( i.e. 11 ) of measurements , only one projector can ( and must ) be assigned the truth value 1 .",
    "this is in direct conflict with the fact that each of the @xmath178 s appears an even number of times in ( [ perestable ] ) .",
    "the data table for these 11 measurements and the 20 states is depicted in a color coded fashion in figure [ fig : peresd ] .",
    "applying the procedure of section [ detfromindet ] allows us to generate matrices @xmath71 and @xmath61 for a deterministic of over @xmath179 ontic states .",
    "the matrices for this of are depicted in figure [ fig : perespm ] .",
    "an example of the contextuality of this of can be seen by considering rows @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which correspond to the same measurement projector @xmath182 ( these rows are marked on @xmath71 in figure [ fig : perespm ] by red arrows ) .",
    "clearly each of these indicator functions must have a 1 at all of the set of ontic states which @xmath183 has support over ( c.f .",
    "the third column in @xmath61 - that is , ontic states 10 through 13 ) .",
    "we see , however , that there are some ontic states ( 71 , 75 and 79 for example ) that do not lie in the support of @xmath183 ) , and to which one of rows @xmath180 or @xmath181 assigns a 1 while the other assigns a 0 .",
    "ontic states such as 71 , 75 and 79 also show that there are some ontic states which are assigned a value @xmath82 by the row in @xmath71 corresponding to @xmath184 but not by the column in @xmath61 corresponding to @xmath185 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this is a general ( necessary ) feature of all ontological models : there are necessarily some ontic states which pass a test @xmath2 for a system `` being in '' a state @xmath1 , which can never be prepared when the preparation procedure specifies the quantum state to be @xmath1 .",
    "this asymmetry of deterministic ontological models between preparations and measurements , which is not present in quantum mechanics , was termed _ deficiency _ in @xcite .",
    "the terminology comes from the fact that the support of the probability distribution corresponding to the quantum state is strictly less than the support of the indicator function corresponding to a projection onto that state , as we have seen .",
    "we term _ unfaithful _ those ontic states which do not lie in the support of the probability distribution , but which _ do _ pass the test ( since for some measurements they will `` choose '' to give a different outcome ) .",
    "note that if an ontological model is therefore to be able to describe preparing the state @xmath1 by performing a measurement of @xmath2 , it is going to be the case that a system in an unfaithful ontic state must be disturbed by the measurement in order to end up in one of the faithful states .",
    "so far we have investigated of s without particular regard to how large the number of ontic states @xmath66 is required to be . in this section",
    "we consider the problem of trying to either find of s with @xmath66 as small as possible , or to reduce the value of @xmath66 for a given of - a process we call `` ontological compression '' .",
    "such a reduction in ontic states clearly has repercussions for the ability to efficiently simulate quantum systems classically - a point we elaborate on in sec .",
    "[ sec : class_simulation ] .",
    "but , as we shall see , our ontological compression schemes also provide routes towards constructing @xmath81-epistemic models in which we can truly view the quantum description of a system as a state of knowledge .",
    "models 1 and 2 gave of s which require @xmath79 and @xmath83 respectively - these values set upper bounds on @xmath66 for indeterministic and deterministic of s respectively .",
    "but since deterministic ontological factorizations can be seen as a special case of indeterministic ones then model 2 also provides an upper bound of @xmath186 for _ indeterministic _ factorizations .",
    "there are therefore upper bounds on @xmath66 for both deterministic and indeterministic models which depend only on a data tables measurements , and upper bounds for indeterministic models which depend on only @xmath5 .",
    "one may therefore wonder whether an upper bound can be found for deterministic models which depends only on @xmath5 .",
    "but this is not possible ; a deterministic ontological factorization always requires at least @xmath187 ontic states .    to see why ,",
    "note that each ontic state , @xmath188 , from a deterministic model is associated with a length @xmath15 binary string , given by the @xmath189 column of the models @xmath71 matrix .",
    "thus the ontic states of any deterministic ontological factorization can be thought of as column vectors , @xmath190 , defining vertices on a unit hypercube of dimension @xmath15 ; @xmath191^{dm}$ ] .",
    "now consider how such a model reproduces the @xmath9 column of the data table @xmath16 ( corresponding to the measurement statistics for some preparation @xmath192 ) in terms of these @xmath193 column vectors .",
    "writing the relevant column of @xmath16 as a vector @xmath194^{dm}$ ] containing the outcome probabilities for each measurement , its entries are reproduced by a convex combination of the @xmath190 , @xmath195 where we use @xmath196 to denote the @xmath197 element of the @xmath49 column of the ofs @xmath61 matrix .",
    "thus deterministic models can be thought of as reproducing @xmath16 by convexly summing over a set of @xmath66 points in a @xmath15 dimensional space .",
    "but at least @xmath187 such points must be convexly summed for us to be able to represent an arbitrary point from @xmath198^{dm}$ ] .",
    "thus we require at least @xmath187 columns of @xmath71 , i.e. at least @xmath187 ontic states .",
    "we can also set a trivial lower bound on @xmath66 :    [ prop3 ] any ontological factorization must be such that @xmath199 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that @xmath148 , the ranks of @xmath200 can not exceed @xmath66 , and for general matrices @xmath201 .    as an example of where this bound can be attained in a deterministic of , consider the data table : @xmath202.\\ ] ] this is the data table for a qubit , where the measurements are the projectors onto the eigenbases of the pauli @xmath203 matrices , and the states are simply the eigenstates of these three operators .",
    "this data table has the following of : @xmath204    this of has @xmath205 , which is less than both @xmath206 or @xmath207 , and which happens to be the rank of @xmath16 .",
    "( note that this of is equivalent to a single toy - bit of spekkens @xcite . )",
    "the first technique for ontological compression we consider can be applied to any of , but finds particular utility in compressing the deterministic of s generated from model 1 ( discussed in section [ detfromindet ] ) .",
    "the key is to consider the possibility that two columns @xmath65 and @xmath208 of @xmath71 , corresponding to ontic states associated with distinct and non - orthogonal quantum states , are identical .",
    "if this is the case , then one of the ontic states is redundant , since any row of @xmath61 ( i.e. any quantum state ) which has support at @xmath65 , could just as well reproduce the relevant statistics in @xmath16 by instead having support at @xmath208 .    for example ,",
    "consider the data table given in ( [ toyd ] ) and suppose that we started with a deterministic un - compressed of of the kind discussed in section [ detfromindet ] so that ,    @xmath209    @xmath210    we can immediately see that several of the columns of ( [ toymbig ] ) are already equal ( specifically , columns @xmath82 and @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , @xmath180 and @xmath214 and @xmath215 and @xmath181 ) .",
    "we can therefore compress the pairs of associated ontic states together .",
    "in general however we may not be so fortunate , and we will need to manipulate the columns of @xmath71 to try and make as many identical as possible .",
    "so long as we respect the constraints imposed by stochasticity and the requirement @xmath216 we are free to alter the entries of @xmath71 as is convenient . in particular ,",
    "we can change which ontic states a given indicator function ( i.e. row of @xmath71 ) uses to reproduce any quantum states statistics within @xmath16 so long as we respect the requirement that one and only one outcome of each pvm should ever occur .",

    "there is however , a subtlety in forcing columns of @xmath71 to be equal in this way .",
    "the permutation we apply to make columns @xmath180 and @xmath219 equal will of course also alter column @xmath211 .",
    "but initially this column was already equal to column @xmath82 . to retain this initial equality",
    "we must apply the same permutation to the bottom box containing columns @xmath82 and @xmath212 ( shown in blue ) .",
    "however , this in turn will alter column @xmath212 , which was initially identical to column @xmath213 and so to retain _ this _ equality we must then permute the bottom box containing columns @xmath213 and @xmath119 ( shown in green ) . performing these three permutations we obtain the following new expression for @xmath71 ,    @xmath220        combined with ( [ toypbig ] ) this reproduces the statistics from @xmath16 . counting identical columns we find that in fact there are now @xmath119 redundant columns in @xmath71",

    "we can then finally update @xmath61 to represent this compression by combining its rows corresponding to each of the four triples of ontic states .",
    "the resultant compressed of is in fact precisely the optimally compressed model given in ( [ toymp ] ) .    in cases with larger data tables ,",
    "the compression is not quite so trivial .",
    "the kernaghan of for example , requires one to keep track of eighty ontic states . by applying an algorithm for randomly combining ontic states according to a natural generalization of the example given above ,",
    "we are able to compress the kernaghan of to use only @xmath225 ontic states .",
    "this is much lower than the @xmath226 ontic states needed by model 2 and almost half the number required by our deterministic rendering of model 1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath71 and @xmath61 matrices are shown in figure [ fig : perespmcompress ] .",

    "it should be noted however , that the compression illustrated in figure [ fig : perespmcompress ] is not guaranteed to be optimal , since it does not saturate the bound given in proposition [ prop3 ] . in general , one would expect the amount by which one can compress an of using this approach to depend on the initially chosen @xmath71 ( picked at random for the above examples ) and the order in which one chooses to compress the various ontic states of the model .",
    "optimizing these choices is highly non - trivial .",
    "the second method for ontological compression we consider is designed to effect a compression for of s based on model 2 .",
    "it is also most easily illustrated by an example .",

    "all of the form @xmath229    that is , the construction of model 2 is such that summing @xmath23 along a column of the boxes yields the probability for the corresponding outcome of the first measurement , summing along a row yields the same for the second measurement .",
    "thus it is clear that if we leave the row and column box - sums invariant we can `` shift around '' the probability weightings that the distributions @xmath230 assign to the ontic states .",
    "if we then find that both distributions assign a weighting 0 to an ontic state , it can be removed completely and some ontological compression has been achieved .",
    "in fact , we already see that @xmath231 , and so this ontic state could be removed .    in order to shift around the probability ,",
    "one simple operation involving 4 ontic states is to map them as follows : @xmath232    since the final state must be a suitable probability distribution , we require @xmath233 . in our example we can use this to implement : @xmath234    in this manner we nullify weighting of both distributions on the middle ontic state ( i.e. @xmath235=0 ) , and it too could be removed :    @xmath236    ( where @xmath237 denotes entries to be deleted . )",
    "we have seen that some sort of ontological compression may be possible , depending on specifics of the data tables involved .",
    "why might one be interested in ontological compression ?",
    "consider a `` family '' of data tables - that is a set of data tables constructed from an increasing number of states and measurements .",
    "an example might be data tables constructed from the family of all stabilizer states on @xmath51-qubits , for increasing values of @xmath51 . if it were the case that this data table can be ontologically compressed such that @xmath66 only grows polynomially with @xmath51 , then an efficient classical simulation of that family of states and measurements is clearly possible .",
    "if we denote by @xmath238 the data table for all @xmath51-qubit stabilizer states / measurements so that @xmath238 has @xmath239 rows / columns ( and @xmath240 would then be the data table of ( [ toyd ] ) ) , then we are asking whether there exists an ontological factorization of @xmath238 which has @xmath241 .",
    "but we can immediately see that this can not be achieved , because any table containing all stabilizer states and measurements will contain a sub - table in which ( for @xmath103 ) @xmath242 preparations are associated with all @xmath51 bit strings over @xmath51 measurements - i.e. a sub - table of the form shown in ( [ table_upper_bound ] ) .",
    "since we have already seen that such a table will require @xmath243 , then its existence clearly prohibits us from finding ontological factorization of the stabilizer data table having @xmath241 .",
    "actually , a polynomial sized number of ontic states is too strong a requirement for efficiency : classical monte - carlo simulations , for example , can be provably efficient for certain problems even when the number of ontic states grows exponentially . since our ontological models are also essentially classical probability representations , we similarly expect a polynomial requirement to be too strong for them .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion of how finding of s is related to other matrix factorization problems .",
    "our data tables are generally not square .",
    "however , in instances where ( such as in the example of eqs .",
    "( [ toyd ] ) and ( [ toymp ] ) ) we use the same quantum states to specify both the preparation procedures and the measurements , then @xmath16 is symmetric , with non - negative entries , and positive semi - definite ( ie doubly non - negative ) .",

    "however , we have already seen an example of such a factorization appearing as an of - the matrices @xmath200 of the example in eqs .",
    "( [ toyd ] ) and ( [ toymp ] ) differ only by an overall multiplicative factor of @xmath163 , and so we can see this example as providing a completely - positive matrix factorization of this particular @xmath16 .",
    "now it is interesting to note that there is an upper bound and rank 1 operators @xmath247 in a fixed hilbert space dimension @xmath39 , then finding such non - trivial upper bounds on @xmath66 can not be achieved by simply finding a family of data tables of continually increasing rank and using proposition [ prop3 ] .",
    "this is because @xmath248 .",
    "( to see this , note that @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath251 denotes the hadamard ( elementwise ) product - the result follows from standard results regarding this product @xcite and from the fact that @xmath252 . ) ] on the cp - rank @xcite which is polynomial in @xmath253 , which , in turn , is polynomial in @xmath39 .",
    "the cp - rank is , in the of picture , the number of ontic states @xmath66 .",
    "thus it seems plausible there exist some interesting data table families which have polynomial ( in @xmath39 ) sized ofs .",
    "there is a second type of matrix factorization which has some connection to the ofs we have been considering : the so - called `` non - negative matrix factorization '' ( nmf ) . in this factorization a matrix of ( non - negative - valued ) image data @xmath254 is factorized into the product of two matrices @xmath255 with non - negative elements : @xmath256    nmf is often considered from the viewpoint of image compression , where the goal is to obtain an approximate factorization where @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) have as small a number of rows(columns ) as possible . some particularly simple procedures for performing this approximate factorization , guaranteed to converge to a local optima ( with respect to various matrix distances between the ideal @xmath254 and the approximate one ) , were given in @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently in @xcite that if one considers optimizing with respect to the kullback - leibler distance , then the local optima preserve the row and column sums of the original matrix .",
    "in particular , if we consider the separate nmf factorizations @xmath259 so @xmath57 is column - stochastic , then the results of corollary 2 in @xcite imply that the nmf found will be such that @xmath260 are column stochastic as we require .",
    "of course our problem requires finding many such factorizations with the _ same _ @xmath61 for the @xmath84 different @xmath57 s .",
    "interestingly , one reason that nmf is useful in image analysis is that it breaks the image up into `` hidden variables '' ( lee and seung s terminology , not ours ! ) such that an image is comprised of pieces which humans recognise as familiar fundamental components ( the ears , nose and mouth of a facial image for example ) .",
    "this is unlike the more standard principal component analysis route to `` eigenimage '' compression . in these terms",
    "the of we are considering is asking an interesting question regarding factorizing many different images ( the @xmath57 s ) using the same set of fundamental component images ( the @xmath61 )",
    "by using an ontological formalism to describe finite sets of preparations and measurements performed on a quantum system we have illustrated how many features of ontological models are manifested in such discretized scenarios .",
    "we have shown how contextuality and deficiency appear in this formalism and have also been able to use the formalism to build a @xmath81-epistemic model of a discrete set of quantum statistics .",
    "we have also seen how any indeterministic description of a finite data table can be developed into an equally valid deterministic one and noted that the same technique ( first employed by bell ) can be applied in the continuum limit .",
    "we have also discussed how ofs can be used to compress the number of ontic states needed to describe such discretized quantum scenarios and speculated on repercussions which this might have for classical simulations of quantum systems .",
