    "recently , the problem of the electromagnetic gauge invariance in the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and similar exclusive processes has intensively been discussed in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "this development explored the similarity with the earlier studied inclusive spin - dependent processes @xcite , and the transverse component of momentum transfer in dvcs corresponds to the transverse spin in dis .",
    "the gauge invariance of relevant amplitudes is ensured by means of twist three contributions and the use of the equations of motion providing a possibility to exclude the three - particle ( quark - gluon ) correlators from the amplitude . after combining with the two - particle correlator contributions ,",
    "one get the gauge invariant expression for the physical amplitude or , in the case of lepton - hadron processes , for the corresponding hadron tensor @xcite .",
    "this method was originally developed in the case of the particular inclusive processes with transverse polarized hadrons , like structure function @xmath1 in dis @xcite and single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) @xcite due to soft quark ( fermionic poles @xcite ) . at the same time , the colour gauge invariance of the so - called gluonic poles contributions @xcite was previously explored @xcite by other methods relying on the wilson exponentials @xcite .",
    "here we combine the approaches described above and apply them in the relevant case of the drell - yan ( dy ) process where one of hadrons is the transversally polarized nucleon .",
    "the ssa in the dy process was first considered in qcd in the case @xcite of the longitudinally polarized hadron .",
    "this observable is especially interesting if the second hadron is a pion , because of the sensitivity @xcite to the shape of pion distribution amplitude , being currently the object of major interest @xcite ( see also @xcite and ref . therein ) .    the imaginary phases in the ssa with longitudinally polarized nucleon are due to the hard perturbative gluon loops @xcite or twist @xmath2 contribution of the pion distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the source of the imaginary part , when one calculates the single spin asymmetry associated with @xmath3 process , is the quark propagator in the diagrams with quark - gluon ( twist three ) correlators .",
    "this leads @xcite to the gluonic pole contribution to ssa .",
    "it has been reproduced ( up to the derivative term , corresponding to the case of single inclusive drell - yan process , when only one of the leptons is observed ) in the case of the non - zero boundary condition imposed on gluon fields , and the asymmetric boundary conditions have been considered as a privileged ones @xcite .",
    "the reason is that these boundary conditions provide the purely real quark - gluon function @xmath4 which parameterizes @xmath5 matrix element . by this fact the diagrams with two - particle correlators",
    "do not contribute to the imaginary part of the hadron tensor related to the ssa .",
    "this property seems quite natural , as the corresponding diagram does not have a cut capable of producing the imaginary phase @xcite .    in our paper",
    ", we perform a thorough analysis of the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor in the light of the qed gauge invariance , the causality and gluonic pole contributions .",
    "we show that to restore the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor , it is mandatory to add the extra diagram contribution ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , also at the twist three level .",
    "in contrast to the naive assumption , we demonstrate that this new additional contribution is directly related to the certain complex prescription in the gluonic pole @xmath6 of the quark - gluon function @xmath4 .",
    "it is essential that this prescription is process - dependent , supporting the idea of effective process - dependent sivers function ( see e.g.@xcite and refs . therein )",
    "related to this correlator .    in more detail",
    ", we show that the causal pole prescription in the quark propagator , involved in the hard part of the standard diagram , supports the choice of a contour gauge and , in turn , the representation of the quark - gluon function @xmath4 in the form of the gluonic pole with the mentioned complex prescription .",
    "this representation must be extended on the diagram , which naively does not contribute to the imaginary part .",
    "they ensure a new contribution to the imaginary part which is necessary to maintain the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "finally , the account for this new contributions corrects the ssa formula for the transverse polarized drell - yan process by the factor of @xmath7 .",
    "we study the contribution to the hadron tensor which is related to the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry measured in the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized nucleon : @xmath8 , where the virtual photon producing the lepton pair ( @xmath9 ) has a large mass squared ( @xmath10 ) while the transverse momenta are small and integrated out .",
    "the left - right asymmetry means that the transverse momenta of the leptons are correlated with the direction @xmath11 where @xmath12 implies the transverse polarization vector of the nucleon while @xmath13 is a beam direction @xcite .",
    "the dy process with the transversely polarized target manifests @xcite the gluonic pole contributions .",
    "since we perform our calculations within a _ collinear _ factorization , it is convenient ( see , e.g . , @xcite ) to fix the dominant light - cone directions for the dy process shown at fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] @xmath14 so that the hadron momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the plus and minus dominant light - cone components , respectively .",

    "this procedure is in agreement with the prescriptions which were appeared in the exclusive case in the parametrization of the generalized gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "note that the fixed complex prescription @xmath53 in the gluonic pole of @xmath4 ( see , ( [ sol - way-1 ] ) ) is one of our main results and is very crucial for a new contribution to hadron tensor we are now ready to explore .",
