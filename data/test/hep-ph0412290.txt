    "the brane models are interesting from both phenomenological and cosmological viewpoints .",

    "+ in this case , cosmological defects are the branes that have less than three spatial dimensions in the uncompactified space - time . in the previous discussions@xcite , in which the dynamical effect of `` our brane '' has been neglected , it was concluded that the cosmological production of monopoles and domain walls are negligible in the models of brane inflation . later in ref.@xcite and @xcite , however , it was shown that cosmological formation of such monopoles and domain walls are quite natural in generic cosmological scenarios .",
    "* defects are deformed branes .",

    "+ in ref.@xcite , localization of matter fields on a fat domain wall is discussed to explain small interactions in the effective four - dimensional action .",

    "new defect configurations are constructed in ref.@xcite , which induce shifts of the localization . due to the shifts of the localization ,",
    "small interactions can be enhanced in the core of these defects .",
    "therefore , these defects can assist the generation of baryon number asymmetry of the universe@xcite .",
    "first , we shall review the essence of the `` previous arguments''@xcite , which were used to exclude the cosmological production of monopoles and domain walls . in the original scenario of brane inflation@xcite ,",
    "inflationary expansion is driven by the potential between d - brane and anti d - brane evolving in the bulk .",
    "then the scenario of the inflating branes at a fixed angle is studied in ref.@xcite , where the slow - roll condition is improved by introducing a small angle .",
    "the end of brane inflation is induced by the brane collision where brane annihilation ( or recombination ) proceeds through tachyon condensation@xcite . during brane inflation ,",
    "tachyon is trapped in the false vacuum , which can result in the formation of lower - dimensional branes after brane inflation .",
    "the production of cosmological brane defects was discussed in ref.@xcite , where it was concluded that cosmic strings are copiously produced in these scenarios , while monopoles and domain walls are negligible . to be precise ,",
    "their arguments are based on the speculation that any variation of fields in the compactified direction must be suppressed during inflation since the compactification radius must be small compared to the horizon size during inflation . then they have concluded that the daughter branes , which are formed by tachyon condensation on the world volume of the mother branes , must wrap the same compactified space as the mother branes . in this case",
    "the effect of compactification seems significant . as a result",
    ", it was concluded that the codimension of the daughter branes must lie within the uncompactified space .",
    "since the number of the codimension must be even in this case , the cosmological defects must be cosmic strings .",
    "moreover , later in ref.@xcite , it was discussed that the analysis does not fully account for the effects of compactification , because the directions transverse to the mother branes had not been considered .",
    "the effect of the rr fields extended to the compactified dimensions was discussed in ref.@xcite . then it was concluded that the creation of the gradients of the rr fields in the bulk of the compactified space is costly in energy , so that there should be a serious suppression in the creation of the daughter d brane as far as they do not fill all the compactified dimensions . as a result , in the `` previous arguments ''",
    ", cosmological brane defects were discussed to suffer from many unnatural constraints .",
    "however , here we should recall that no such suppression has been discussed so far in the cosmological production of the conventional defects in four - dimensional effective gauge theory , while the realistic brane models must reproduce the standard model in its effective action .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to think about the following questions .",
    "is it really impossible to produce branes that do not wrap the same compactified space as the mother branes ?",
    "is it really impossible to produce monopoles and domain walls in brane inflation ?",
    "here we should note that the `` previous arguments '' are not fully reliable in more realistic cases .",
    "the most obvious example was first discussed in ref.@xcite , where the inconsistency of the string tension is solved in angled inflation . in the original argument in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the tension of the string did not coincide with the one calculated from the effective action .",
    "this inconsistency is clearly due to the assumption that the daughter brane must wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane .",
    "in fact the previous arguments might be true in some simplest cases , however we must be more careful about the process of the brane recombination . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the production of the cosmic strings in angled inflation is realized by the creation of the daughter branes that are * extended * between the splitting mother branes .",
    "it should be noted that the creation of such extended branes is not a counter example to the generic mechanism of tachyon condensation . to be precise",
    ", one can understand from a careful treatment of the effective action@xcite that the eigenfunction of the tachyonic mode should be localized at the intersection .",
    "since the mechanism of this localization is * different * from the kibble mechanism , this argument does not contradict to the `` previous arguments '' .",
    "therefore , the `` seed '' must be localized at the intersection . as the recombination proceeds , the @xmath0 brane at the intersection is pulled out of the mother @xmath1 branes , and finally becomes extended between mother branes . in this case the serious problem of the rr field is also avoided , since the length of the extended daughter brane vanishes when it is created at the intersection .",
    "it costs energy to pull @xmath0 branes out of the @xmath1 branes , however the cost is paid by the repulsive force between the splitting @xmath1 branes .",
    "of course the tension of such extended daughter branes matches precisely to the d - term strings in the effective action .",
    "moreover , this conclusion is consistent with the analysis of the string production in the effective action , where the production of the d - term strings is not suppressed .",
    "of course , it seems obvious from the string perspective that the brane creation is due to the local dynamics of the open strings at the intersection of the splitting @xmath1 branes , which suggests the obvious localization of the eigenfunction .",
    "the daughter branes satisfies the required properties .",
    "thus at least in the models of angled inflation , it is obvious that the cosmic strings in the effective action do not wrap the same compactified space as the mother branes .    from the above discussions , it is natural to think that the previous arguments are not reliable and",
    "should be compensated in more generic cosmological scenarios .",
    "obviously , there is no reason that we must believe that in their final state the daughter branes must wrap the same compactified space as the mother branes .",
    "since the previous argument can not fully account for the generic process of the cosmological defect formation , one can hardly accept their conclusions .",
    "is it really impossible to produce sufficient amount of cosmic monopoles and domain walls by the brane creation ?",
    "this question is answered in ref.@xcite , paying careful attention to the brane dynamics after inflation , especially to the dynamics of `` our brane '' . for the extended branes to be produced between mother branes ,",
    "the distance between mother branes is required to be zero at a moment .",
    "this idea is generic and applicable to other conventional cosmological processes .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the effective action is sometimes described by the recombination of the branes@xcite or by the branes falling apart , which can be induced by the thermal effects@xcite . as a result , contrary to the previous speculation , it was shown@xcite that there is no reason that one should believe that monopoles and domain walls@xcite are suppressed in the brane universe , once the dynamics of `` our brane '' is included .    besides the cosmological defects that are formed by the brane creation",
    ", one can consider the defects that are formed by the continuous deformation of the branes .",
    "the two kinds of the brane defects can be produced by the same process@xcite .",
    "therefore , the actual cosmological defects should be * the mixture of these defects .",
    "* it should be noted that the analyses of such mixed defects are quite important in understanding the evolution of the brane universe .    from the above viewpoints",
    ", we shall reconsider the evolution of the cosmic strings in angled inflation . in this paper , we show that the strings in angled inflation can be distinguished from the conventional cosmic strings . in angled inflation ,",
    "cosmic strings are the daughter @xmath0 branes that are extended between mother @xmath1 branes .",
    "the @xmath0 branes have the flat direction ( moduli ) in the compactified space , along which the endpoints of the @xmath0 branes can move freely on the @xmath1 branes . ] then the position of the @xmath0 branes can vary along the cosmic strings , which results in the peculiar type of @xmath2-dimensional kink configurations .",
    "one can also find the peculiar winding states that are defined on the world volume of the strings . a schematic picture of the kinks is shown in fig.[fig : necklace ] .",
    "the point - like objects that appear on strings are monopoles . since the monopoles are skewered with the strings , the cosmic strings in angled inflation become necklaces .",
    "these kinks are produced by the spatial deformation of the @xmath0 branes .",
    "therefore , the brane necklaces are the * hybrid * of the brane creation and the brane deformation .",
    "the chopped loops of the necklaces can shrink to produce the stable winding states , which looks like coils . a schematic picture of the brane coils is shown in fig.[fig : shrink ] .",
    "it should be noted here that the brane coils wind around the compactified space that is * different * from the mother branes .",
    "of course the mechanism that induces such windings is different from the kibble mechanism .",
    "therefore , our mechanism avoids the serious constraints that have been discussed previously in ref.@xcite .",
    "in the early universe there could be a pair of brane anti - brane separated in the compactified space .",
    "the potential energy of these branes can drive brane inflation , then they annihilate rapidly at the end .",
    "if this process contains only a pair of @xmath7 branes , it might be true that only cosmic strings are produced after inflation . in this case , the cosmic strings are the daughter branes that wrap the same compactified space as the mother branes . at first",
    "the strings could move freely in the compactified space , but later their position should be fixed as was discussed in ref.@xcite . then , if one assumes that other branes ( including `` our branes '' ) are decoupled , these strings can not break nor dissolve into other branes . in this case , since other branes are completely decoupled from the cosmic strings , the interactions of the cosmic strings must be quite simplified . the cosmological consequence of this scenario is already investigated in ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , in generic cases it seems rather difficult to obtain enough number of `` decoupled '' cosmic strings while reheating the universe to an acceptable temperature . if the moving brane of the brane inflation collides to the stack of the standard model ( sm ) branes , reheating should be successful .",
    "however , in this case one can not ignore the interaction between the daughter branes and the other branes at the stack .",
    "since the cosmic strings are the lower - dimensional branes that could break or dissolve into other branes , in generic cases one can not simply ignore the interaction between other branes . therefore , it is important to investigate cosmic strings that intersect with other branes .    from the above viewpoints , we shall try to understand the evolution of the cosmic strings in angled inflation to show how one can distinguish the cosmic strings in angled inflation from the conventional ones .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section , angled inflation is the most obvious generalization of the simplest brane inflation , where the slow - roll condition is improved and the * cosmic strings intersect with `` our branes''*. if the potential that lifts the flat direction of the cosmic strings is shallow , the brownian motion in the compactified space must be important .",
    "the brownian motion in the direction that is perpendicular to the daughter brane can be induced by the brane collision@xcite .",
    "even if the potential is not shallow due to the stringy effects , it seems natural to expect that the internal position of the cosmic strings can vary because of the energetic process of the brane collision . in any case",
    ", it seems too optimistic to expect that the potential is so steep that one can avoid the generation of the kinks on the strings .",
    "moreover , if the angle is small(@xmath8 ) and the final state of the recombined mother brane wraps about @xmath9 times around the compactified space , ] the potential should have many local minima .",
    "these minima appear as the `` domains '' on the strings . to be precise",
    ", strings can have several distinctive regions(domains ) where the branes are located at different sites in the compactified space . ] then kinks ( i.e. ( 1 + 1)-dimensional domain walls ) will appear on the strings , which interpolates between neighboring domains on the strings .",
    "these kinks may have interesting consequences .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to think about the configuration where the internal position of the cosmic string is changed so that it finally wraps around a non - trivial circle of the compactified space",
    ". then a peculiar type of topological number can be defined * on * the strings , which can stabilize the chopped loops .. ] the winding states of the strings look like coils . even though the brane coils are stabilized by their windings ,",
    "they can be annihilated with another coils that have the opposite windings    the cosmological evolution of the conventional necklaces is already investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite interesting to investigate the brane necklaces so that we can find the crucial difference from the conventional necklaces .",
    "because of their peculiarity , the brane necklaces can be used to distinguish the brane universe from the conventional one .",
    "of course the above speculation seems rather naive , therefore we shall discuss this issue in more detail .      to make our discussions simple and convincing ,",
    "here we consider angled brane inflation with a small angle(@xmath10 ) . in this case",
    ", the eigenfunction of the tachyonic mode should be localized at the intersection .",
    "it should be noted that this mechanism of the localization is * different * from the conventional kibble mechanism , which suggests that our result does not contradict to the previous arguments .",
    "moreover , comparing the effective tension of the daughter branes with the one obtained in the effective action , one can easily confirm that the cosmic strings in angled inflation must be extended between mother branes .. ] if the daughter branes are extended between the mother branes as is shown in fig.[fig : flat ] , it is easy to see that the daughter branes can move freely along the mother branes . the flat direction that corresponds to the free motion in the compactified space",
    "is depicted in fig.[fig : flat ] .",
    "of course , we know that the flat direction is supposed to be lifted by the potential that is due to the conventional supersymmetry breaking , which induces the mass of @xmath11 . on the other hand , since we are considering small angle @xmath10 , the flat direction @xmath12 is periodic and winds about @xmath13 times around the compactified space .",
    "therefore , the number of ( local or global ) minima should be as large as @xmath14 .",
    "if the potential that lifts the flat direction is shallow , the brane strings can initially move freely along the flat direction . even if the potential is not so shallow due to the stringy effects",
    ", one can naturally expect that the collision is so energetic that the daughter branes can stay at any minima .",
    "branes located at different sites in the compactified space can not intersect with each other@xcite , because their separation in the compactified space is larger than the string scale .",
    "let us consider the @xmath2 dimensional world on the strings .",
    "the @xmath2 dimensional world on the strings will have many domains of the number of @xmath15 , which correspond to the degenerated or quasi - degenerated vacua on the flat direction .",
    "then the domain walls will appear on the strings , which interpolate between the two neighboring domains .. ] the width of the domain walls is determined by the shape of the effective potential @xmath16 , which becomes @xmath17 if the potential is induced by the conventional mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , or can become as thin as @xmath18 if the potential is lifted by the stringy dynamics .    * in the former case , the height of the effective potential is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the typical distance between the neighboring vacua . from the dimensional argument",
    "one can easily understand that the mass of the monopoles is @xmath21 .",
    "dimensional world of the strings must have non - zero cosmological constant due to the tension of the string in the background .",
    "therefore , the precise formula of the effective potential should contain the effective cosmological constant , which may or may not dominate the vacuum energy . since the cosmological constant in this case is nothing but the tension of the strings , one can easily understand that kinks are point - like objects that are `` skewered '' with the strings . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers point - like objects to which two strings are `` attached '' , the definition of the mass should be obscured because of the contribution from the string tension . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the former ( skewered ) picture for fat monopoles .",
    "see also fig.[fig : skew ] ] * from the brane perspective the kinks are corresponding to the @xmath0 branes that are extended along the internal direction .. ] the kinks are nothing but the monopoles , which correspond to the @xmath0 branes that are extended in the @xmath22-dimensional compactified space . then one can easily calculate the effective mass of this brane configuration , which becomes @xmath23",
    ".    as we have discussed above , there are two different contributions to the mass of the monopoles .",
    "when one considers the sqcd - mqcd correspondence , one should think that the potential in the effective action must properly represent the brane dynamics .",
    "of course , in such cases the two must agree@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the effective potential that lifts the flat direction is due to the undefined mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , the results can not agree .",
    "therefore , in our case the mass of the monopoles becomes @xmath24 in the limit @xmath25 , while the mass is dominated by the brane tension if @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we shall consider these two different limits without specifying the origin of the effective potential .",
    "let us consider the evolution of the network of the brane necklaces .",
    "the strings at different domains can not reconnect because they are placed at a distance in the compactified space .",
    "therefore , in the length scale that is much larger than the distance between the monopoles , the reconnection probability of the necklaces is suppressed by the number of the minima : @xmath27 the evolution of such strings is already discussed in ref.@xcite . according to ref.@xcite , one can easily understand that the cosmic strings in @xmath10 angled inflation are quite important in the observation of the gravitational wave signals",
    ". however , here we must be cautious because the evolution of the network of the necklaces can be different from the conventional @xmath28 strings .",
    "therefore , we should first examine the effect of the monopoles that might or might not affect the evolution of the network of the @xmath29 strings . of course , it is apparent that the details must be investigated using numerical simulations , however here we can modestly assume that one can use the conventional analyses as far as the parameter space of the model is within the range of ref.@xcite .    to make our arguments clear , we use the same notations as in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the monopoles are formed * before * the strings are produced at the second phase transition . in our case , however , the monopoles are formed * after * the strings are formed . since the succeeding evolution of the necklaces is irrelevant to how they are formed , the analysis in ref.@xcite is applicable in our case .",
    "the sequence of the phase transition is only relevant to their initial condition .",
    "for example , if monopoles are produced long after strings are produced , their initial average separation @xmath30 will be large compared to the original analysis of the conventional necklaces .    *",
    "if the potential is lifted by the conventional mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , the temperature @xmath31 when monopoles are formed can be estimated as @xmath32 . in this case",
    ", the width of the monopoles @xmath33 is as large as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , their initial average separation @xmath30 is inevitability as large as the horizon size . * as we have stated above , one can consider steep potential that could be induced by the stringy effects . in this case",
    ", monopoles should be produced at the same time when strings are produced , which suggests that the initial average separation between monopoles can range from the minimal distance @xmath34@xcite to the horizon size .",
    "here we introduce an important quantity for the evolution of the necklaces , which is the dimensionless ratio @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath30 denote the tension of the strings and the separation between the monopoles , respectively . in general",
    ", the initial value of @xmath37 can be large or small , depending on the nature of the two phase transitions . as we have discussed above",
    ", we are considering two different limits .    *",
    "when monopoles are thin and are dominated by the brane dynamics , the mass of the monopoles is @xmath38 . in this case",
    "we can assume @xmath39 , which results in the initial value of the ratio @xmath40 .",
    "* on the other hand , if the potential is almost flat and is lifted by the conventional mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , the mass of the monopoles becomes @xmath41 . in this case , since the width of the monopoles is as large as @xmath42 , we must assume @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the initial value of the ratio is @xmath44 .    in both cases",
    "we can put a modest assumption that @xmath45 .",
    "following the arguments in ref.@xcite , we can obtain the following equation for @xmath46 : @xmath47 where the first term on the right hand side describes the string stretching due to expansion of the universe , while the second term describes the competing effect of string shrinking due to gravitational radiation .",
    "in this regime , one can find that if @xmath37 is initially small it will grow at least until @xmath48 .",
    "as @xmath37 grows , monopole anti - monopole ( or coil anti - coil ) annihilation should become important and the growth of @xmath37 will terminate .    *",
    "if the potential is steep and the mass of the monopoles is given by @xmath49 , the width of the strings @xmath50 should be comparable to the width of the monopoles @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , in this case one can assume that @xmath51 , which leads to the result @xmath52 .",
    "this result suggests that as far as @xmath53 the parameter space of our model is within the range of the original argument in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath54 , the loop self - intersections should be frequent and their fragmentation into smaller loops is very efficient .",
    "therefore , a loop of size @xmath55 typically disintegrates on a time scale @xmath56 which modifies the conventional analysis of the @xmath29 strings . *",
    "if the potential is almost flat and the mass of the monopoles is given by @xmath41 , the maximum value of the ratio becomes @xmath57 , which suggests that the monopoles are negligible . in this case , the standard evolution of the string network is applicable .",
    "let us recall the main quantities that are used in the standard analysis of the evolution of a string network .",
    "the long string network is characterized by the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the coherence length , which is defined as the distance beyond which the directions along the string are uncorrelated .",
    "@xmath59 is the average distance between the strings , and @xmath60 is the characteristic wavelength of the smallest wiggles that appear on long strings .",
    "the length @xmath61 of the chopped - off loops are characterized by the parameter @xmath62 , @xmath63 where the standard value of @xmath62 is determined by the gravitational radiation losses from loops , which is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a numeriacl coefficiend of o(10 ) .",
    "if the gravitational radiation from counter - streaming wiggles on long strings is much less efficient in damping the wiggles than ordinarily thought , @xmath62 should be much smaller than @xmath66@xcite . in our case , if the ratio @xmath37 is small , the equation of motion is not different from the original argument , which means that we can examine the evolution of the network just using the results obtained in ref.@xcite . in the macroscopic scale where the reconnection probability is small , one can estimate the above parameters as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a significant fraction of the total string length within hubble volume should go into loops each hubble time , whose number density is @xmath69 which is precisely the same as the original result .",
    "however , what we should show in this paper is the difference from the standard results , which can be used to distinguish the brane necklaces from the conventional defects . in the original argument in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the reconnection probability of the strings is @xmath29 at any time during the evolution of the network .",
    "however , in our case the small reconnection probability is due to the fact that the strings in different vacua can not reconnect .",
    "therefore , in the macroscopic scale which is much larger than the distance @xmath30 , the brane necklaces look precisely the same as the original @xmath29 strings , while in the microscopic scale they look quite different .",
    "for example , if the wavelength of the wiggles @xmath70 is much smaller than @xmath30 , the production of the small loops is efficient and at least in the local region the brane necklaces look like conventional @xmath71 strings . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wavelength of the wiggles @xmath70 is much larger than @xmath30 , one can easily understand that the evolution of the brane necklaces is quite similar to the @xmath29 strings .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath72 , we can conclude that the evolution of the brane necklaces is precisely the same as the conventional @xmath73 strings as far as @xmath74 is satisfied .",
    "the above relation ( [ wigled ] ) puts a cut - off time for the original analysis of the @xmath28 strings , which is not important for the gw burst analysis at the present cosmic time .",
    "the numerical simulations of this kind are difficult , because of the two hierarchically different scales .",
    "however , what is important for the observation of the gw emitted from strings is the behaviour at the macroscopic scale .",
    "therefore , it must be important to note that at later period the behaviour of the brane necklaces is quite the same as the conventional @xmath29 strings , which is already discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude that the brane necklaces can have significant impact on the observation of the gravitational wave .",
    "please be sure that in our model the small reconnection probability is due to the small angle .",
    "our next example is the peculiar case of @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", the characteristic length scale of the network will be modified@xcite as : @xmath76 the string length per unit volume is @xmath77 .",
    "the number of loops formed per hubble volume per hubble time is therefore@xcite @xmath78 the loop self - intersections should be frequent and their fragmentation into smaller loops is very efficient , which suggests that the lifetime of a loop of size @xmath55 is @xmath79@xcite . in this case",
    ", it is easy to see that the loops produced by the necklaces of @xmath75 are short - lived and the calculation of the loop density is similar to the cases of small @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding loop density is therefore @xmath80 here we have assumed that the wiggles are small compared to the typical scale of the network , so that @xmath81 .",
    "the results obtained here suggests that the analysis of the gw signals emitted by the network of the cosmic necklaces are similar to the original argument@xcite .",
    "the difference that we have found is the suppression factor @xmath82 in their loop density .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that there is no qualitative difference between the brane necklaces and the conventional strings(or necklaces ) as far as the observation of the gravitational wave signals is concerned .",
    "however , as we have discussed above , chopped loops of the brane necklaces can be stabilized due to their non - zero windings around compactified space .",
    "the stable relics of such loops are superheavy , which must satisfy the cosmological bound of the conventional cold dark matter .",
    "therefore , in order to find qualitative differences , it is quite important to calculate the relic density of the brane coils .    to calculate the relic density of the stable relics ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the relative abundance @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the entropy density . in our case",
    ", small loops are produced through multiple self - interactions of larger loops , whose sizes are determined by the wavelength of the wiggles @xmath85 . the conventional analysis of @xmath86 string network is reliable as far as @xmath87 .",
    "* let us first consider the case where the effective potential @xmath16 is due to the stringy dynamics . in this case ,",
    "monopoles are produced by the phase transition just after angled inflation .",
    "the number of the loops formed per hubble volume per hubble time is already given in ref.@xcite . for @xmath88 , it becomes @xmath89 which cooresponds to the number of the coils emitted from the network of the brane necklaces .",

    "the ratio @xmath91 is : @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath95 is the time when the monopoles are produced as the kinks on the strings , and @xmath96 is defined by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the cut - off time when the wavelength of the wiggles becomes much larger than the typical distance between monopoles .",
    "we have assumed that the coils produced before @xmath98 are negligible .",
    "* we must be careful if the effective potential @xmath16 is lifted by the conventional mechanism of supersymmetry breaking . in this case , since the sizes of the monopoles are comparable to the hubble radius when they are formed , initially the wiggles can not form coils .",
    "the coils are formed at much later period when @xmath99 , which means @xmath100 .    as we have discussed above , a rough estimation of the characteristic properties of the networks of the brane necklaces",
    "is straightforward .",
    "their evolution can be approximated by the evolution of the conventional @xmath29 strings or the necklaces .",
    "on the other hand , one may suspect that the `` vacua '' on the strings might not be degenerated , and the brane necklaces might not behave as we have discussed above .",
    "we think this claim could be true .",
    "if the vacua on the strings are only quasi - degenerated , the tension of the strings in the different domains will be different by a small factor @xmath101 .",
    "due to @xmath102 , the monopoles may move along the strings , and may be annihilated or gathered to form coils on the strings . after the `` true vacuum '' dominates the necklaces , the reconnection probability of the necklaces will be enhanced up to @xmath103 , because the other `` false vacua '' have shrunk to a point .",
    "then the situation becomes quite the same as the evolution of the conventional @xmath71 necklaces@xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the monopoles are replaced by the coils , which can stabilize the loops of the strings .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the cosmological evolution of the cosmic strings in angled inflation .",
    "we have shown that the cosmic strings in angled inflation turn out to be the brane necklaces .",
    "the evolution of the networks of the brane necklaces is similar to the conventional @xmath29 strings .",
    "however , the loops of the brane necklaces will shrink to produce superheavy winding states , which look like coils . in angled inflation ,",
    "it is therefore possible to distinguish the brane necklaces from the conventional cosmic strings and necklaces .",
    "moreover , the reconnection probability of the brane necklaces can be enhanced up to @xmath104 if the degeneracy of the vacua is resolved by a small perturbation .",
    "we have made a rough estimation of the characteristic properties of the network of the brane necklaces .",
    "it is obvious that the numerical simulations are required to obtain more sensible results .",
    "here we should discuss what we can say about the conventional brane strings in the simplest scenario of @xmath105 brane inflation . as is already discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", it seems natural to think that the position of the daughter branes in the compactified space should be stabilized . on the other hand",
    ", however , there is no sensible reason that we have to believe that the potential has only a unique global minimum in the compactified space .",
    "therefore , it is always important to consider daughter branes that have multiple minima in the compactified space . as a result",
    ", it is always natural to consider cosmic strings that have many domains on their world volume , which induces kinks interpolating between them .",
    "even if the flat directions are stabilized at a unique minimum , winding states ( coils ) can appear if the brownian motion induces windings around a nontrivial circle in the compactified space .",
    "naively , the nontrivial circle means a conventional noncontractible circle that winds around compactified space . in generic cases , however , the nontrivial circle could be a valley of the potential that winds around a hill .",
    "it is obvious that * any * branes that are produced by brane collision can have flat directions in the internal space .",
    "then due to the brownian motion , the cosmic strings will become the brane necklaces or the brane coils .",
    "the brane necklaces can therefore be produced in other generic brane models .",
    "if the necklaces are produced , they can be used to probe the internal structure of the compactified space . moreover",
    ", future numerical simulations will provide us the important information about the undetermined parameters , which may put serious bounds on brane inflation .",
