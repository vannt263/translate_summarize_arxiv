    "electroproduction of mesons in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath2  gev and @xmath3  gev@xmath4 , is a modern tool which permits to study the structure of the nucleon on the partonic level .",
    "exclusive channels in dis are of particular importance . in this kind of hard processes",
    "one may learn about the off - forward parton distributions that parameterize an intrinsic nonperturbative pattern of the nucleon , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "much work have been done to understand the production of pions in exclusive kinematics .",
    "for instance , in qcd at large values of @xmath5 and finite value of bjorken @xmath6 the description of @xmath7 relies on the dominance of the longitudinal cross section @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the transverse part @xmath9 is predicted to be suppressed by power of @xmath10 .",
    "however , being a leading twist prediction the kinematic domain where this power suppresion dominates is not yet known for @xmath11 production .",
    "a somewhat different concept is used in regge pole models which rely on effective hadronic degrees of freedom . here",
    "the exclusive @xmath12 forward production mechanism is peripheral , that is a sum of all possible @xmath13-channel meson - exchange processes .",
    "although both partonic and regge descriptions are presumably dual the exclusive reactions have a potential to discriminate between different models .",
    "related studies have been carried out at jlab  @xcite and at desy  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated program on exclusive production of pions is planned in the future at the jlab upgrade .    on the experimental side ,",
    "it is tempting to see an onset of @xmath14 scaling at presently available energies .",
    "however , the high @xmath15 data from jlab and single spin asymmetries measured in true dis events at hermes  @xcite show clearly nonvanishing transverse components in @xmath16 . at jlab",
    "@xcite , desy  @xcite , cornell  @xcite and cea   the high @xmath15 region is dominated by the conversion of transverse photons in @xmath9 . for instance , the @xmath15 dependence of the partial @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross sections in the @xmath17 electroproduction above @xmath2  gev has been studied in  @xcite . in the charged pion case",
    "the longitudinal cross section @xmath8 at forward angles is well described by the quasi - elastic @xmath11 knockout mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is driven by the pion charge form factor  @xcite both at jlab and hermes .",
    "on the contrary , the @xmath5 behavior of @xmath9 remains to be puzzling .",
    "the data demonstrate that @xmath9 is large and tends to increase relative to @xmath8 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath5 dependence of exclusive @xmath9 exhibits features similar to that in @xmath18 semi - inclusive cross sections in dis in the limit @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this kind of an exlusive - inclusive connection  @xcite has been also observed in exclusive @xmath20 production  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "hadronic models based on the meson - exchange scenario alone largely underestimate the measured @xmath9 in electroproduction , see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussions and references therein .",
    "phenomenological solutions of the @xmath9 problem already exist in the literature  @xcite . the description of charged pion production proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the residual contribution of the nucleon resonances .",
    "it is supposed that the excitations of nucleon resonances dominate in electroproduction .",
    "the resonances are dual to the direct partonic interactions due to the bloom - gilman duality connection and , correspondingly , their form factors are determined by parton distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath21-channel resonances supplement the reggeon exchanges in the @xmath13-channel .",
    "therefore , we distinguish peripheral @xmath13-channel meson - exchange processes and the @xmath21-channel resonance / partonic contributions . in this way",
    "all the data collected so far in the charged pion electoproduction @xmath22 at jlab , desy , cornell and cea can be well described  @xcite . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ effhermes ] we show our results for the @xmath23 dependence of the differential cross section @xmath24 in exclusive reaction @xmath16 at hermes .",
    "@xmath23 dependence of the differential cross section @xmath24 in exclusive reaction @xmath16 at hermes .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "the calculations are performed for the average values of @xmath25 in a given @xmath15 and bjorken @xmath6 bin .",
    "the solid curves are the full model results .",
    "the dash - dotted curves correspond to the longitudinal @xmath26 and the dashed curves to the transverse @xmath27 components of the cross section .",
    "the dash - dash - dotted curves describe the results without the resonance / partonic effects . ]",
    "in this talk we consider the electroproduction reaction @xmath28 here we assume that the target nucleon is unpolarized , whereas we allow arbitrary polarization for the incoming electron . with a polarized beam @xmath29 and with an unpolarized target",
    "there is an additional component @xmath30  @xcite in the @xmath31 cross section which is proportional to the imaginary part of an interference between the l / t photons and therefore sensitive to the relative phases of amplitudes .    using the polarized electron beam , the longitudinal beam single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in @xmath32 scattering",
    "is defined so that @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to positive helicity @xmath35 of the incoming electron . the azimuthal moment associated with the beam ssa",
    "is given by @xmath36    in general , a nonzero @xmath30 or the corresponding beam ssa @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ bssa ] ) , demands interference between single helicity flip and nonflip or double helicity flip amplitudes . in regge models",
    "the asymmetry may result from regge cut corrections to single reggeon exchange . this way the amplitudes in the product acquire different phases and therefore relative imaginary parts .",
    "a nonzero beam ssa can be also generated by the interference pattern of amplitudes where particles with opposite parities are exchanged .",
    "in the left panel of fig .",
    "( [ bsaavakian ] ) we plot the clas data  @xcite for the azimuthal moment @xmath38 associated with the beam ssa , eq .",
    "( [ beamssamoment ] ) , in the reaction @xmath39 .",
    "these data have been collected in hard scattering kinematics @xmath40  gev , @xmath41  gev and @xmath42  gev@xmath4 .",
    "the experiment shows a sizable and positive beam ssa .    in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "( [ bsaavakian ] ) we present our results for the azimuthal moments @xmath38 in the reactions @xmath39 and @xmath43 , respectively .    at first , we consider @xmath38 generated by the exchange of regge trajectories . in fig .",
    "( [ bsaavakian ] ) the dashed curves describe the model results without the effects of resonances and neglecting the exchange of the axial - vector @xmath44 regge trajectory .",
    "this model results in a zero @xmath38 and therefore a zero beam ssa .",
    "the addition of the unnatural parity @xmath44-exchange generates by the interference with the natural parity @xmath45 exchange a sizable @xmath38 in both channels .",
    "this result corresponds to the dash - dotted curves in fig .",
    "( [ bsaavakian ] ) . in the rest of unpolarized observables",
    "the effect of the axial - vector @xmath44 is small .",
    "however , as one can see , the contribution of @xmath44 is important in the polarization observables .",
    "for instance , a strong interference pattern of the @xmath44-reggeon exchange makes the polarization observables , like the beam ssa , very sensitive to the different scenarios describing the structure and behavior of @xmath44 in high-@xmath15 processes . in the last step we account for the resonance contributions .",
    "the latter strongly influence the asymmetry parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the model results ( solid curves ) are in agreement with the positive @xmath38 in the @xmath46 channel and predict much smaller @xmath38 in the @xmath47 channel .",
    "a sizable and positive @xmath38 has been also observed at hermes in @xmath46 sidis close to the exclusive limit @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the beam spin azimuthal moment @xmath38 in exclusive reaction @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 for different @xmath50 bins .",
    "the solid curves are the model results and account for the residual effect of nucleon resonances .",
    "the experimental data are from  @xcite . ]",
    "as in deep exclusive @xmath46 electroproduction a sizeable and positive beam ssa has recently been measured at clas / jlab also in the exclusive reaction @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the simple regge model used in  @xcite fails to explain the measured kinematic @xmath5 dependencies .",
    "we have , therefore , extended our calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to the neutral pion channel . in the regge exchange contributions",
    "the vector @xmath52 , @xmath45 and axial - vector @xmath53 and @xmath54 trajectories are taken into account .",
    "we find that at high values of @xmath15 the dominant contribution to the beam ssa again comes from the residual excitation of nucleon resonances .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ beamssapi0 ] and describe the jlab data very well .",
    "in summary , a description of exclusive pion electroproduction @xmath31 off nucleons at high energies is proposed .",
    "following the two - component hadron - parton picture of refs .",
    "@xcite the model of ref .",
    "@xcite combines a regge pole approach with residual effects of nucleon resonances .",
    "the contribution of nucleon resonances has been assumed to be dual to direct partonic interaction and therefore describes the hard part of the model cross sections .    in this talk",
    "we presented the results for the cross sections with longitudinally polarized electron beam .",
    "we have shown that the resonance / partonic mechanism is responsible for the positive azimuthal beam ssa observed in exclusive reactions @xmath39 and @xmath51 . on the contrary ,",
    "the beam ssa in deep exclusive @xmath47 production off the neutrons is predicted to be much smaller in magnitude and very sensitive to the different scenarios concerning the structure of the @xmath44 axial - vector meson .",
