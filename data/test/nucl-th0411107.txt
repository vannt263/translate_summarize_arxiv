    "nuclear matter in @xmath1-equilibrium is one of the main objects of interest of nuclear physics with direct astrophysical implications .",
    "several theoretical models were developed for describing the nuclear matter .",
    "a direct connection between the fundamental nucleon - nucleon interaction and nuclear matter properties is provided by the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) theory @xcite which successfully describes properties of symmetric and also asymmetric nuclear matter . however",
    ", this sophisticated approach can not be applied to finite nuclei calculations yet .",
    "thus , other approaches are still relevant .",
    "due to its elegant framework , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite has been widely and successfully applied to wide range of finite nuclei . in order to eliminate phenomenological nature of rmf theory",
    "the free parameters can be fitted to the more fundamental dbhf approach @xcite , thus obtaining effective dbhf parametrization applicable also to finite nuclei .",
    "an alternative way is using the density dependent relativistic hadron theory @xcite .    in recent years",
    "a significant progress in development of experimental techniques and devices was achieved .",
    "modern accelerators enabled study of high energy ion collisions producing nuclei with high isospin asymmetry and nuclear densities higher than those occurring in normal nuclei .",
    "therefore , a special attention was paid to a proper asymmetry description , e.g. , an enhancement of isovector meson sector by @xmath0 meson introduction was performed @xcite .",
    "however , better improvement of density dependence of symmetry energy was achieved by including of the scalar - vector cross interaction ( vci ) term @xcite .",
    "in addition to nuclear physics research also astrophysical phenomena are starting to provide relevant data with an accuracy needed to constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "neutron star masses and radii may be able to provide such constraints , due to their essential dependence on eos , and many works deal with such calculations using dbhf approach @xcite , rmf theory @xcite , or density dependent hadron field theory @xcite .",
    "since in the neutron star interior we expect densities of several times of the nuclear saturation density , extrapolation of models to high density region is inevitable .",
    "classical view of matter as consisting of protons , neutrons and electrons is thus insufficient and more realistic composition is needed . at higher densities",
    "the @xmath2-condensate @xcite , quark deconfinement @xcite and/or hyperons @xcite are possible to appear .",
    "after theoretical suggestion of the hyperon @xcite and hypernuclei @xcite appearance in high density nuclear matter many works paid attention to them , e.g. , @xcite , and experimental effort has started to obtain empirical data @xcite .",
    "however , hyperon - meson coupling constants still remain uncertain .",
    "a partial exception is the @xmath3 hyperon where some constraint of its bindings is possible @xcite .",
    "even poorer knowledge we have about the @xmath4-nucleon interaction .",
    "there is an absence of bound @xmath4 hypernuclear states @xcite which might be a support for a high density repulsion of @xmath4-nucleon force as indicated by extrapolated atomic data @xcite .",
    "however , this is still an open question . in any case",
    ", it seems to have only a weak effect on bulk properties of hyperon matter @xcite , due to similar influence of the heavier @xmath5 hyperon , which ( same as the @xmath3 hyperon ) feels attractive potential @xcite .",
    "previous deducing of the @xmath6 interaction from older double @xmath3 hypernuclei data suggested a highly attractive potential @xcite , while the very recent experimental observation of a @xmath7he double hypernucleus demonstrated @xcite that @xmath6 interaction is only weakly attractive .",
    "with respect to all these facts , we used hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon coupling constants derived from su(6 ) quark model for vector and isovector meson sector .",
    "hyperon couplings to scalar mesons were fitted to reproduce experimental data for hypernuclei and double hypernuclei ( see the next section for more details ) .",
    "recently , the rmf parametrization of dbhf results for nuclear matter , including isovector scalar @xmath0 meson as well as scalar - vector cross interactions @xcite , was obtained .",
    "the results indicate a strong influence of cross interaction on the density dependence of symmetry energy .",
    "the goal of this paper is an application of this parametrizations also to asymmetric nuclear matter with hyperons , and thus to study the effect of additional degrees of freedom on a composition of dense matter .",
    "the theoretical framework described in the section ii .",
    "is followed by presentation and discussion of the obtained results in the section iii .",
    "conclusions are summarized in the section iv .",
    "we start with the lagrangian density that introduces baryon field @xmath8 , lepton fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 , isoscalar - scalar meson field @xmath11 , isoscalar - vector meson field @xmath12 , isovector - vector meson field @xmath13 , isovector - scalar meson field @xmath14 ( pion field does not contribute because of its pseudoscalar nature , and nuclear matter is parity invariant ) .",
    "hidden strange scalar meson @xmath15 and vector meson @xmath16 are introduced in order to better simulate hyperon - hyperon attraction observed in @xmath6 hypernuclei .",
