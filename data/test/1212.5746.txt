    "the relative sizes of the contrasts can be estimated from the ratio of nv@xmath0 centers with nearest - neighbor @xmath1c atoms to those without nearest - neighbor @xmath1c atoms .",
    "since the natural abundance of @xmath1c atoms is 1.1% and there are three nearest - neighbor positions to the vacancy , we expect the ratio of contrasts to be roughly @xmath28 .",

    "side - resonance groups b , d , and e are present in the signals of the w5 and s8 samples and absent in that of the w2 sample .",
    "since the concentration of @xmath1c does not vary across samples and the side resonances in group c are present in the signals of all samples , the resonances in group c are most likely due to interactions of the nv@xmath0 center with @xmath1c .",
