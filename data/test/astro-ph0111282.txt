    "it is well established that the diffuse x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies implies the existence of a hot ( 10@xmath1 k ) , thermally radiating intracluster medium ( icm ) . in the dense centers of many clusters",
    "this gas is expected to cool radiatively in less than a hubble time .",
    "as pressure support decreases the gas will gravitate towards the bottom of the cluster potential well , a phenomenon that has come to be known as a `` cooling flow '' ( cf .",
    "fabian 1994 ) .",
    "such cooling flows can be detected by direct x - ray imaging , where they are seen as a surface brightness enhancement in the x - ray emission from a region typically @xmath0 100 - 200 kpc in radius , and by spectroscopic observations which reveal gas at cooler temperatures than the surrounding icm .",
    "the excess x - ray luminosity in the cooling flow region is typically 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 , corresponding to roughly 10 - 50 % of the total cluster x - ray emission ( peres et al .",
    "the mass deposition rate is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gas temperature at r@xmath6 , the cooling radius .",
    "estimated cooling flow rates in the centers of rich clusters vary from 30 - 300 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 ( white , jones , & forman 1997 ) and in some cases reach mass deposition rates of 1000 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 or more ( allen 2000 ) .",
    "a long - standing problem with the cooling flow scenario has been the fact that the large quantities of cool gas expected to accumulate from the flow have rarely been detected .",
    "searches for cool gas in atomic or molecular form have generally proven unsuccessful ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; jaffe 1990 ; mcnamara , bregman , & oconnell 1990 ; odea et al .",
    "1994 ; voit & donahue 1995 ; jaffe & bremer 1997 ; donahue et al .",
    "2000 ) , with reported upper limits two orders of magnitude smaller than the masses implied by x - ray mass deposition rates ( although see edge 2001 ) . while some support for the cooling flow picture is provided by low energy x - ray spectra of clusters which appear to require larger absorption than can be accounted for by foreground gas alone ( white et al .",
    "1991 ; allen et al . 1993",
    "; irwin & sarazin 1995 ) , it now appears that the fraction of clusters that actually possess such excess absorption may be much less than previously thought ( arabadjis & bregman 2000 , hereafter ab2000 ; bhringer et al .",
    "furthermore , recent high - resolution x - ray spectra obtained with the xmm - newton and chandra satellites have failed to show expected emission lines from cooled gas at temperatures below a few kev ( fabian et al . 2001 ; peterson et al . 2001 ; tamura et al . 2001 ) and it has also been found that local isothermality matches the spectral data of `` cooling flow '' regions better than the continually declining temperature profile predicted by the standard cooling flow model ( e.g. molendi & pizzolato 2001 ; bhringer et al .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the lack of detectable cool gas in cooling flows ; these include reheating the gas , mixing , differential absorption , efficient conversion of cooling flow gas into low mass stars , inhomogeneous metallicity distributions , or disruption of cooling flows by recent subcluster mergers ( see recent discussions in fabian et al .",
    "2001 and peterson et al .",
    "2001 ) . as of",
    "yet , it is unclear whether any of these mechanisms are capable of resolving the aforementioned problems with the cooling flow model .",
    "one characteristic that is common to the mechanisms mentioned above is that they have mainly been introduced in an `` after the fact '' manner .",
    "that is , they assume the observed mass deposition rates are basically correct but that something is happening to the gas after ( or while ) it cools , be it reheating or conversion into low mass stars or some other process .",
    "perhaps a simpler way of addressing the problems of the cooling flow model are to look for ways to reduce the mass deposition rates from the beginning .",
    "one way to achieve this is to reduce the excess emission ( @xmath8 ) associated with cooling flows by attributing some ( or all ) of it to x - ray sources other than thermal bremsstrahlung or line emission from the icm . but are there sources luminous enough to reproduce @xmath8 , can they be found within galaxy clusters , and , most importantly , can they mimic hot cluster gas ?",
    "soon after x - ray emission was first detected from galaxy clusters , katz ( 1976 ) proposed that much of this emission might come from individual compact sources such as those known to exist in our own galaxy .",
    "however , the subsequent discovery of iron emission lines in x - ray spectra ( forman & jones 1982 , and references therein ) clearly demonstrated that thermal bremsstrahlung from a diffuse intracluster gas is the dominant source of x - ray emission in clusters , and interest in compact sources quickly waned .",
    "nevertheless , compact sources must surely contribute some fraction of the total x - ray emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "a growing body of evidence indicates that a substantial intergalactic population of stars , star clusters and stellar remnants is present in the cores of rich clusters , and some of these objects will be x - ray sources .",
    "for example , ferguson , tanvir , & von hippel ( 1998 ) showed the existence of intergalactic stars in the virgo cluster , and planetary nebulae associated with this population have also been detected ( e.g. , arnaboldi et al .",
    "1996 ; ciardullo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "similarly , west et al . ( 1995 ) hypothesized the existence of a large population of intergalactic globular clusters in the cores of galaxy clusters based on observed galaxy - to - galaxy variations in globular cluster populations .",
    "furthermore , there is mounting evidence that many cluster galaxies have been destroyed over a hubble time , victims of collisions with other galaxies or disruption by the mean tidal field of the cluster potential in which they reside ( e.g. , thompson & gregory 1993 ; lopez - cruz et al .",
    "1997 ; gregg & west 1998 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; calcaneo - rodin et al . 2000 ) .",
    "as galaxies are disrupted they will spill their contents throughout intracluster space , including x - ray sources such as x - ray binaries , globular clusters , and black holes .",
    "such disruption is likely to be most frequent in the dense cluster core , and hence would be expected to produce a substantial pool of intracluster material , including compact x - ray sources , at the cluster center .",
    "any significant contribution by these compact sources to the x - ray flux will have to be taken into account when estimating the properties of icm , including temperatures , densities , and cooling flow mass deposition rates .",
    "an intracluster population of compact objects would have a different spectral signature than thermal emission from intracluster gas .",
    "for instance , the spectra of large spiral and elliptical galaxies reveal the presence of hard x - ray emission which is thought to be produced by either high mass x - ray binaries or accretion onto massive black holes and is adequately represented by power - laws having @xmath9 @xmath0 0.6 - 3.0 ( where @xmath10 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; allen , di matteo , & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "luminous agn , on the other hand , are often fit by power - laws with @xmath9 @xmath0 1.6 - 2.0 ( nandra et al .",
    "indeed , the spectral signatures of such objects have already been identified in several x - ray clusters by allen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using asca data",
    ", these authors found very luminous sources with power - law spectral indices characteristic of compact sources .",
    "the recent discovery of luminous _ extended _ non - thermal x - ray emission in several weak ( or non- ) cooling flow clusters ( rephaeli , gruber , & blanco 1999 ; fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; 2000 ; 2001 ) suggests that one should also look for such emission in massive cooling flow clusters . at present , the origin of the diffuse non - thermal emission is still a matter of some debate .",
    "suggested mechanisms include inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons up to x - ray energies via a population of highly relativistic electrons , and non - thermal bremsstrahlung , likewise , by a population of relativistic electrons ( sarazin 2001 ; rephaeli 2001 ) .",
    "those highly relativistic electrons may have been accelerated by recent subcluster merger events which shocked the icm or may have been ejected from a central massive black hole .",
    "the discovery of x - ray holes at the positions of radio lobes of a central compact object in several massive cooling flow clusters ( e.g. bhringer et al .",
    "1993 , mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) certainly lends credence to the second hypothesis .",
    "recently , harris et al . ( 2000 ) ( chandra data ) and bhringer et al . ( 2001b ) ( xmm - newton data ) have even identified extended non - thermal emission directly associated with radio jets / lobes in 3c295 and m87 , respectively .",
    "the spectral signature of extended non - thermal emission is also different from that of thermal emission . to date , the extended non - thermal components of x - ray spectra of clusters have adequately been modeled by power - laws having @xmath11 ( fusco - femiano et al . 1999 ; 2000 ; 2001 ) . as with luminous compact sources ,",
    "a proper deduction of cluster properties should explicitly include the effects of extended non - thermal emission in the analysis .    in the present work we assess the case for a power - law component to the x - ray spectra of cluster centers , in particular those with cooling flows .",
    "we show that simultaneous fits of rosat pspcb and asca gis / sis spectra , which have been used to infer the presence of cooling flows in many clusters to date , are in fact consistent with a significant contribution from compact sources and/or extended non - thermal emission . using rosat hri data , we have placed limits on the contribution of any bright point sources within the central regions of these clusters and conclude that the power - law components are most likely produced by either a collection of many low - luminosity compact sources ( with @xmath12 ergs s@xmath3 ) or by diffuse non - thermal emission or by some combination of the two .",
    "we shall assume @xmath13 = 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath14 throughout .",
    "ten well - studied x - ray luminous galaxy clusters ( table 1 ) were chosen to span a wide range of cooling flow mass deposition rates .",
    "five of these have essentially no cooling flow ( ncf ) , while the other five cooling flow ( cf ) clusters have calculated mass deposition rates ranging from 189 to 645 solar masses per year .",
    "observations by the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspcb ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) and the asca gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) and solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) were obtained from the heasarc public archives and reduced using ftools v5.01 .",
    "the combination of rosat and asca data provides good sensitivity to both soft and hard x - ray emission , spanning the total energy range 0.14 - 10.0 kev , and should provide a strong test of power - law components in the x - ray spectra of clusters .",
    "the rosat pspcb data were corrected for spatial and temporal gain fluctuations in the detector .",
    "x - ray spectra , spanning the energy range 0.14 - 2.04 kev , of all ten clusters were extracted from circular regions centered on the peak of the emission with a constant extraction radius ( r ) of 3 arcminutes .",
    "background spectra were selected from source - free circular regions of radius r. all spectra were corrected for the effects of cosmic rays in the detector ( snowden et al .",
    "1992 ) , vignetting , spatial variations in detector efficiency , and deadtime .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were then grouped to ensure a minimum of 20 counts per radial bin so that reliable @xmath15 statistics could be computed .",
    "the rosat hri data was reduced in a manner similar to the pspcb data .",
    "the hri data was used to place limits on the contribution of any point sources within the central regions of these clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the hri lacks spectral resolution and was not used in the main spectral analysis .",
    "a description of the analysis of hri data is given in section 5 .",
    "no hri data were available for a2063 or a3532 .      the screened events from `` revision 2 '' processing of asca gis / sis data were used .",
    "additional cleaning procedures ( discussed in the asca abc guide ) were implemented , including gain and deadtime corrections . for the gis detectors ( gis2 and gis3 ) , x - ray spectra spanning the energy range 0.7 - 10.0 kev were extracted from the same region of sky as that of the rosat pspcb source spectra . for the sis detectors ( sis0 and sis1 ) , x - ray spectra spanning the range 2.0 - 10.0 kev",
    "were extracted , thus avoiding complications with the degrading efficiency of the sis detectors at low energies .",
    "background spectra for both the sis and gis detectors were extracted from the `` blank sky '' observations made during the performance testing stage of the mission .",
    "spectra were extracted from the same regions of the detectors as that of the source spectra ( thus minimizing position - dependent effects associated with background subtraction ) .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were also grouped ( or binned ) to ensure @xmath15 statistics could be used . for the clusters a2142 and a3667 sis1 data were ignored because of an excess of hot and flickering pixels .",
    "reduced rosat pspcb and asca gis / sis spectra were fit simultaneously using models within the software package xspec v11 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "each cluster was fit with a variety of models based on mekal thermal plasma routine ( mewe & gronenschild 1985 ; kaastra 1992 ; liedahl et al .",
    "1995 ) , and/or redshifted power - laws .",
    "in addition , we used the popular cooling flow model comprising a thermal plasma ( mekal ) and cooling flow component implemented by the mkcflow routine within xspec ( mushotzky & szymkowiak 1988 ) .",
    "fits were obtained by varying the temperature ( @xmath16 ) and metallicity ( @xmath17 ) of thermal plasma component(s ) and by varying the photon index ( @xmath9 ) of any power - law components .",
    "photoelectric absorption ( balucinska - church & mccammon 1992 ) was applied to the spectral models through two separate methods : i ) by applying only one absorption component to the entire spectral model and fixing the hi column density ( @xmath18 ) at the known galactic value ( see table 1 ) and then letting it vary to see if the fit could be improved ; ii ) by applying one absorption component to the entire spectral model ( with @xmath18 fixed at the galactic value ) and a separate redshifted variable absorption component ( @xmath19 ) to any power - law components via the zphabs model in xspec .",
    "the second method allows for _ intrinsic _ absorption to be associated with any power - law components .",
    "spectra of nearby high mass x - ray binaries and accreting massive black holes provide strong evidence for heavy intrinsic absorption , with @xmath20 @xmath21 above the galactic column ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; iwasawa et al . 2000 ; akylas et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we therefore regard the addition of a free intrinsic absorption parameter as an important feature of our spectral analysis .",
    "henceforth we will use tp , pl , and cf to refer , respectively , to thermal plasma ( mekal ) , power - law , and mkcflow components .",
    "for example , in this notation tppl identifies a model having thermal plasma and power - law components .",
    "goodness of fit was judged by the reduced chi - square ( @xmath22 ) and by visual inspection of residual plots .",
    "when additional components were added to a spectral model , for example adding a power - law component to a thermal plasma component to make tppl , the corresponding f - statistic was calculated in order to judge whether the addition was reasonable . unless stated otherwise , the derived relative contributions of each of the components to the total flux refer to the energy range 0.14 - 10.0 kev stated , whereas the luminosities presented refer to the asca gis band only ( 0.7 - 10.0 kev ) , since the spectra were fit simultaneously and not combined .",
    "all luminosities presented were corrected for galactic absorption only .    to check our data reduction procedures , spectra from each of the detectors were also fit individually and no significant deviations were found .",
    "we have also attempted to duplicate published results by arabadjis & bregman ( 2000 ) for three clusters derived using the same data ( rosat pspcb ) and the same software .",
    "the results , which refer to the inner 3 arcminute radius , are presented in table 2 . here , the hotter tp component is fixed at the white , jones , & forman ( 1997 ) value , @xmath23 , @xmath18 is fixed at the stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) value , and the energy range is 0.14 - 2.4 kev and 0.14 - 2.04 kev for ab2000 and our study , respectively .",
    "the comparison shows excellent agreement , with derived temperatures and mass deposition rates having the same values to within one standard deviation .",
    "we find that single - temperature tp models provide acceptable fits to the spectra of a119 , a2063 , a3266 , a3532 , and a3667 ( 1.00 @xmath24 @xmath22 @xmath24 1.17 ) with temperatures in very good agreement with previous studies ( white , jones , & forman 1997 ; markevitch et al .",
    "significant improvement is not usually obtained by varying the hydrogen column density from the known galactic value reported by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) or stark et al .",
    "the derived metallicities range from @xmath25 which is typical of the intracluster medium ( allen & fabian 1997 ) .    in general , both pure pl models with or without variable intrinsic absorption",
    "do not provide acceptable fits to the ncf cluster spectra with @xmath26 @xmath27 1.4 .",
    "this result is not unexpected since it leaves no room for thermal emission from the icm . with intrinsic absorption",
    "included , an acceptable fit is obtained for a3532 with @xmath28 , however .",
    "this cluster is located at the center of the shapley concentration and is thought to be undergoing a merger with a3528 .",
    "the diffuse non - thermal emission generated from such a merger might possibly account for the ability of the simple pl model to fit the spectrum of a3532 .",
    "unfortunately , no hri data exists for this cluster so we can not place limits on the contribution of any point sources within the central 3 arcminutes .    0.1 in    0.1 in    in the best fitting tppl models , the pl component typically contributes 1 - 14% ( mean of 7 % ) when absorbed by the galactic column only or 10 - 25 % ( mean of 20 % ) when intrinsic absorption is included ( excluding a3532 which has an anomalously large pl component ) .",
    "we note that in virtually every case the inclusion of intrinsic absorption noticeably improves the quality of the fit , making it superior to even the simple tp models ( see table 3 ) .",
    "a mean f - statistic of @xmath29 ( @xmath27 95 % confidence ) was found when the pl component with intrinsic absorption was included in the fit indicating that its addition is , indeed , reasonable .",
    "the corresponding luminosities of intrinsically absorbed pl components range from @xmath30 erg s@xmath3 with a mean value of @xmath31 erg s@xmath3 ( corrected for galactic absorption only ) .",
    "photon indices for these components are typical of compact accretion - driven x - ray sources and extended non - thermal emission .",
    "interestingly enough , the amount intrinsic absorption ranges from @xmath32 @xmath21 which is typical of optically thick compact sources .",
    "we also note that the temperature of the icm tends to decrease significantly when a power - law component is included .",
    "this trend was previously reported by allen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) when including a power - law component in their spectral models .",
    "figure 1 presents the best fit tppl model to the spectrum of a3667 . for clarity ,",
    "only the rosat pspcb data are plotted .",
    "as expected , standard cooling flow ( tpcf ) models of our non - cooling flow sample yield best fits with @xmath33 = 0 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 to within one sigma .",
    "the mass deposition rate for the modest cooling flow cluster a2063 , however , is 25 @xmath34 12 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the cooler component in our tptp models typically contributes zero flux to within one sigma ( @xmath0 10 % for a2063 & a3667 ) .",
    "neither of these models provided fits significantly better than those of the standard tp models .    in summary",
    ", we confirm earlier investigations which find that tp models provide satisfactory fits to rosat and asca spectra of the centers of non - cooling flow clusters .",
    "however , tppl models which include intrinsic absorption generally provide fits of superior quality , and predict that the power - law component contributes 20 percent of the total flux . the photon indices of this component are typical of accreting x - ray sources and/or diffuse non - thermal x - ray emission which usually range from @xmath35 .",
    "we have fit the spectra of the cf clusters with the same variety of models used in the previous section , but also with an additional model ; tptppl .",
    "this model represents the emission from the observed region as the sum of the hot icm , a diminished cooling flow ( second tp component ) , and intermixed compact sources and/or extended non - thermal emission characterized by the pl component .",
    "simple tp models generally provide fairly reasonable fits to the spectra with 1.1 @xmath36 @xmath22 @xmath36 1.25 .",

    "none of the fits were significantly improved by letting the value of @xmath18 vary .",

    ", the pl component typically contributes 5 - 30 % ( mean of 20 % ) of the total flux when absorbed only by the galactic column .",
    "the inclusion of intrinsic absorption significantly improves the quality of the fit and raises the contribution of the pl component to 9 - 47 % ( mean of 27 % ) .",
    "the mean f - statistic value for the addition of this power - law component is @xmath37 which suggests it is significant ( @xmath38 99 % confidence ) .",
    "the luminosity ( 0.7 - 10.0 kev ) of pl components in these four clusters span @xmath39 ergs s@xmath3 , with a mean value of @xmath40 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the photon indices of pl components are reasonably well constrained and range from 1.0 @xmath41 2.4 ( mean of 1.8 ) ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the implied intrinsic column densities acting on the pl component are rather high for three of the cf clusters ( a644 , a1689 , & a2597 ) and are consistent with high - mass compact sources . as with the ncf clusters ,",

    "1998 ; allen 2000 ; ab2000 ; allen et al .",

    "the addition of intrinsic absorption on the pl component , again , improves the fit and the mean contribution of the pl component is raised to @xmath43 32 % . when compared to the tppl model , the mean f - statistic value is about 5 ( @xmath43 68 % confidence ) which suggests the addition of a second tp component only improves the fit marginally . the luminosity ( 0.7 - 10.0 kev ) of the pl component ranges from @xmath44 ergs s@xmath3 with a mean value of @xmath45 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the power - law components have photon indices of 1.8 @xmath41 3.3 with a mean of 2.3 . with the exception of a2029 ( which has virtually no contribution from the pl component ) , the intrinsic column densities on the pl component are @xmath46 @xmath21 .",
    "the temperature of the cooler tp component did not change significantly from the value derived from tptp models .",
    "however , it s contribution to the flux was generally lower than that of tptp models ( mean @xmath0 10 % ) .    in summary , we find that in all cases the tppl and tptppl models fit the rosat and asca spectra of the five cf clusters just as well as the standard cooling flow model ( tpcf ) or the two - temperature thermal plasma ( tptp ) .",
    "the pl components of these models are quite luminous ( contributing between 27 - 32 % of the total flux ) and characterized by photon indices typical of compact accreting x - ray sources and/or extended non - thermal emission .",
    "this , then , is the main conclusion of our work : _ rosat and asca spectra can be satisfactorily modeled by attributing a significant part of the luminosity within the central regions of cf clusters to sources other than cooling gas . _",
    "our analysis shows that luminous ( l@xmath47 @xmath0 10@xmath48 ergs s@xmath3 ) power - law components with @xmath49 might be present in the centers of rich clusters . including intrinsic absorption dramatically improves the quality of the fit ; in these circumstances , there is an apparent dichotomy in the importance of the pl components between ncf and cf clusters .",
    "not only is the typical pl component in the cf cluster more luminous by about a factor of 10 than that of its ncf counterpart , but it also contributes a larger fraction of the total x - ray flux within the central 3 arcminutes of its cluster ( between 27 - 32 % for cf clusters as opposed to 20 % for ncf clusters ) .",
    "this may be consistent with the fact that the _ cores _ of cf clusters are more often observed to be active ( i.e. radio loud ) , perhaps implying the presence of a central massive black hole(s ) and a surrounding diffuse plasma of relativistic electrons , than the cores of ncf clusters ( burns 1990 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the improvement of the fit to the spectra of cf clusters far exceeds the improvement of the fit to the spectra of ncf clusters when a power - law component is included in the spectral model .",
    "the most attractive feature of the tppl models is that one does not expect large quantities of atomic or molecular gas to be present in the centers of clusters , nor does one expect to see emission lines below a few kev , because cooling is not significant .",
    "this is consistent with current observations . on the other hand , evidence which apparently supports the existence of cooling flows ( e.g. excess absorption , detection of co line emission in extreme cf clusters ) may contradict this model .",

    "the tptppl models , which might represent a compromise between the standard cooling flow model and our favoured tppl models , also provide good fits to the spectra of the cf clusters .",
    "however , the addition of the second , cooler tp component only marginally improves the fit and at the expense of adding much more complexity ( and uncertainty ) to the model .",
    "furthermore , the predicted temperatures and relative contributions of the cooler tp component in the tptppl models suggest that emission lines below a few kev should be present , however they have failed to turn up in chandra and xmm spectra .",
    "finally , because the mean contribution of the cooler component is @xmath0 10 % , as compared with 20 % in the tptp models , this implies that mass deposition rates are only roughly reduced by a factor of two . using models similar to our tptppl models , allen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reached the same conclusion for a number of clusters in their sample .",
    "these reduced deposition rates are still far too large to be consistent with the small amounts of atomic and molecular gas found in cooling flow clusters .",
    "we expect that chandra and xmm - newton will place much tighter constraints on the parameters of the complex tptppl models and it will be interesting to see if the models can be reconciled with problems of the standard cooling flow model .",
    "assuming that a power - law component is , indeed , present in the spectra of these clusters , some of the possible candidates are :    * seyfert - like agn could contribute most , if not all , of the pl component luminosity found in our study .",
    "these objects can be quite luminous and are often observed to have @xmath52 @xmath53 ergs s@xmath3 with power - law indices of 1.6 - 2.0 ( nandra et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , allen et al .",
    "2001 have suggested that agn are the likely candidate for the observed pl component in their sample .",
    "likewise , the luminosities and steepness of the pl components in our sample are generally consistent with emission from a central agn(s ) . * diffuse non - thermal emission , which has possibly been seen in the central regions of coma , a2256 , and a2199",
    ". searches of those clusters using beppo - sax and rxte have yielded very luminous ( @xmath43 10@xmath48 ergs s@xmath3 ) sources which are described by power - laws with @xmath54 and may possibly be linked to power - law components observed in the asca band ( rephaeli , gruber , & blanco 1999 ; fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; 2000 ; 2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately , x - ray spectra usually have to be extracted from regions _ much _ larger than that of the central galaxy and , thus , it is difficult to draw conclusions about the source of the power - law component .",
    "a vla survey of more than 200 nearby clusters found that only 29 had extended radio emission on mpc scales ( giovannini , tordi , & feretti 1999 ) perhaps implying that extended non - thermal emission is not that common in galaxy clusters .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the detection of true intracluster radio emission is exceptionally difficult , as one must remove bright radio galaxies from the analysis ( rephaeli 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the non - thermal emission may be associated with the radio galaxies themselves ( e.g. in the radio lobes ) . * massive black holes associated with elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the regions sampled in our study generally include a single giant elliptical or cd galaxy plus a number of large galaxies , probably e or s0 galaxies .",
    "colbert & mushotzky ( 1999 ) and allen , di matteo , & fabian ( 2000 ) have recently discovered hard power - law components in several nearby ge galaxies with @xmath55 ergs s@xmath3 with photon indices of 0.5 - 3.0 .",
    "such sources are typically less luminous than seyfert nuclei , perhaps as a result of low radiative efficiency from an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi ) . while several of these sources could , in principle , account for the pl component in the ncf clusters they would have to be scaled up by a factor of 100 to account for the emission in the cf clusters .",
    "faint galaxies , on the other hand , are much more numerous and many of them might harbor less massive central black holes . the local group elliptical m32 , whose central object has @xmath56 erg s@xmath3 ( loewenstein et al .",
    "1998 ) offers a possible guide to the x - ray luminosity of faint cluster members .",
    "hence @xmath57 such galaxies , each with a supermassive black hole , would be required to account for the power - law component of the clusters studied here . on this basis ,",
    "faint galaxies seem incapable of producing significant power - law emission inside the regions we have observed .",
    "we note , however , that if massive black holes originally belonging to bright or faint galaxies are now scattered throughout intracluster space ( i.e. no longer associated with optically visible galaxies ) as the result of past mergers or stripping both of these limits may be relaxed . *",
    "galactic x - ray binaries , having @xmath58 ( white et al .",
    "1988 , verbunt et al .",
    "1995 ) , and which in our galaxy are most commonly associated with globular clusters .",
    "intergalactic globular clusters , if similar to globular clusters in the milky way , would have to be present in large numbers to collectively account for @xmath59 erg s@xmath3 attributable to the pl component in our models . assuming a typical intergalactic globular contains a binary x - ray source with @xmath60 @xmath61 ergs s@xmath3 ( hertz & wood 1985 ) and the specific frequency of globulars in the central ge galaxy is @xmath62 ( harris 1991 ) then even a very bright central galaxy with m@xmath63 = -24 would have a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath64 ergs s@xmath3 , too low by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "even the most optimistic models of intracluster globular clusters of west et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predict @xmath66 such clusters , significantly less than is required to account for the entire pl component .",
    "hence , it appears that there are probably two or three sources capable of producing the luminosity of the pl components of our models : massive black holes associated ( or once associated ) with large elliptical galaxies , diffuse non - thermal emission , and agn .",
    "does existing data favor one type of source over the others ?    to determine the luminosity of any point sources within the central 3 arcminutes we used rosat hri data .",
    "two different procedures were implemented : i ) spectra of clearly visible point sources were extracted from a 5  region centered on the source and grouped into one large energy bin ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "the spectra were then fit within the xspec package using a simple power - law model with @xmath67 and absorbed by the galactic column only . the 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux was then converted into a 0.7 - 10.0 kev unabsorbed flux using the program w3pimms .",
    "if more than one point source was present the individual fluxes were summed .",
    "as an example , figure 3 is the hri observation of a3667 , smoothed with a 5  gaussian beam .",
    "there are at least two bright compact sources within the central 3 arcminutes of this cluster . ;",
    "ii ) to place limits on the contribution of point sources which are hidden in the bright diffuse background ( what we refer to as `` barely visible '' point sources ) we calculated the mean standard deviation of counts per pixel ( within 3 ) and then scaled this to a standard deviation per circular region of diameter = 5  ( comparable to the hri psf ) .",
    "the latter value was expressed as unabsorbed flux ( 0.7 - 10.0 kev ) using the program w3pimms and assuming a simple power - law spectral model with @xmath67 absorbed only by the galactic column listed in table 1 .",
    "we regard the result as a 1-sigma limit to the contribution of any point sources .",
    "0.1 in    0.1 in    the results of hri data analysis are presented in table 5 .",
    "one or more point sources are easily visible within the central 3 arcminutes of all three ncf clusters having hri observations .",
    "it is clear from a comparison with the luminosities of the observed pl component from the best fitting tppl models ( with intrinsic absorption ) , however , that the bright point sources can not be solely responsible for the power - law emission , as they contribute only @xmath43 5 % of the pl component luminosity .",
    "significant contributions are required from low - luminosity point sources and/or diffuse non - thermal emission .",
    "the third column in table 5 ( method ii ) presents the 3-sigma limit of `` barely visible '' point sources , suggesting that at least @xmath68 of them are needed ( in addition to the visible point sources ) to account for the entire power - law component .",
    "there are no visible point sources within the central 3 of the 5 cf clusters studied .",
    "this is almost certainly the result of the cf clusters being much more centrally peaked than the ncf clusters .",
    "at least @xmath68 `` barely visible '' point sources are required to account for the observed pl component in these clusters .",
    "perhaps another way to differentiate between compact sources and diffuse non - thermal emission is through the presence or absence of flux variability , since most luminous accreting x - ray sources are known to vary significantly on short time scales ( e.g. nandra et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , because the pl component typically contributes only @xmath69 % this might make detection of variability difficult in clusters ( especially in the cf clusters ) .",
    "furthermore , if the pl component is produced by @xmath68 point sources , and the variations in each are random , it will make the variation in the collective luminosity quite small , perhaps rendering this method unusable .",
    "if compact or diffuse non - thermal sources provide significant emission from the centers of rich clusters , it will be necessary to revise a number of conclusions derived from x - ray data . fully exploring the consequences",
    "is beyond the scope of the present paper ; however , we will mention a few important issues .",
    "allen ( 2000 ) reports that a deprojection analysis of rosat hri data yields cooling flow mass deposition rates that agree reasonably well with those derived from asca spectra .",
    "a consistent re - analysis would require first subtracting the power - law contribution from the x - ray images , but of course the spatial distribution of the power - law emission must first be understood .",
    "the presence of emission lines from heavy ions originally led astronomers to accept thermal emission as the dominant mechanism in rich cluster icms .",
    "accretion - driven x - ray sources do exhibit line emission ( kallman , vrtilek , & kahn 1989 ; narayan & raymond 1999 ) , but the lines are produced under quite different physical conditions than those within the canonical hot icm .",
    "the implications for icm abundance estimates and enrichment scenarios will require careful study .",
    "likewise , previously derived temperatures of the icm will also be affected ( as demonstrated in table 3 ) .",
    "might emission from compact sources account for the excess hard x - radiation recently discovered ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ; ikebe et al .",
    "1997 ) in the centers of several clusters ?",
    "the next generation of x - ray detectors and satellites ( i.e. xmm and chandra ) will be needed to map the x - ray emission with adequate spatial resolution to address this and other questions raised by the present work .",
    "we have shown that rosat pspcb and asca gis2/gis3 spectra of ten x - ray luminous clusters permit a significant contribution from compact sources and/or diffuse non - thermal emission .",
    "although this conclusion holds irrespective of the presence of a cooling flow , we find that power - law components are especially luminous in clusters with massive cooling flows .",
    "our study indicates that inferred cooling flow mass deposition rates may be lowered substantially , thus ameliorating , or possibly resolving , the long - standing problem of the missing cool gas .",
    "existing x - ray observations of large elliptical galaxies , agn , and extended non - thermal emission suggest that any of these sources could account for the observed luminosity of the power - law component . however , the absence of extremely bright point sources in the rosat hri observations rules out the possibility that the power - law emission comes from a few extremely bright compact sources .",
    "more likely is that most of the power - law emission is produced by some combination of diffuse and low - luminosity compact sources , such as massive black holes .",
    "the deep imaging capabilities and superior spectral resolution of chandra and xmm should be able to place much tighter constraints on the relative contributions of power - law sources and thermal bremsstrahlung to cluster x - ray emission and , perhaps , even determine the source of the power - law emission .",
    "we thank the rosat and asca help teams , in particular jane turner , for advice with data reduction techniques .",
