    "grb 010222 , one of the brightest bursts detected so far , was detected in both the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) monitor and the wide field camera-1 ( wfc ) aboard the bepposax satellite , on feb 22.308 ( piro 2001 ) .",
    "the refined position from wfc was centred at @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( j2000 ) with an error circle of radius 2.5 arcmin ( gandolfi 2001a ) .",
    "bepposax detected the x - ray afterglow in the 1.610  kev range about 9  hours after the grb prompt event ( gandolfi 2001b ) .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was also observed by the chandra observatory about 15 hours after the burst on feb 22.936 ut ( garmire et al . 2001 ) and again on march 3.54 utc ( harrison , yost & kulkarni 2001 ) .",
    "the bepposax observations between 8 and 65 hours since the outburst are reported by int zand et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "henden ( 2001a ) reported the detection of the optical transient ( ot ) at about 18th magnitude in @xmath8 , about 4.4 hours after the burst , located at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) .",
    "photometry of the ot has been reported in several gcn circulars and by masetti et al ( 2001 ) , lee et al ( 2001 ) , sagar et al ( 2001 ) and stanek et al ( 2001a ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the ot showed several absorption line systems superimposed on a power - law continuum ( garnavich et al 2001 ; jha et al 2001a , b ; masetti et al 2001 ) .",
    "these absorption line systems consisted of red - shifted doublets of fe  ii ( 2585 , 2599  ) , mg  ii ( 2796 , 2803  ) and a host of other lines which indicate basically three intervening absorbers located at @xmath11 0.927 , 1.155 and 1.475 . the detection of mg  i line and the presence of strong absorption lines of mg  ii with equivalent widths of @xmath12 13   are generally interpreted as indicating that the grb occurred in a galaxy at the highest redshift seen , viz .",
    "@xmath13 = 1.475 .",
    "the equivalent width of the mg  ii doublet is particularly large , especially in the system at @xmath13 = 1.475 ( @xmath12 3  ) which implies a column density of @xmath14 atoms @xmath15 , if the composition is taken to be universal .",
    "we report here the optical observations made using the recently installed 2-m telescope at the indian astronomical observatory , located in hanle , ladakh ( @xmath16  e ; @xmath17  n ; altitude of 4500  m above msl ) .",
    "this set of observations forms one of the first data sets obtained from the telescope on scientific programmes even as the commissioning tests are underway . also included in the paper are the observations made using the telescopes at the vainu bappu observatory .",
    "the optical transient ( ot ) associated with grb 010222 was observed for @xmath18 days both from the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) and the vainu bappu observatory ( vbo ) beginning @xmath0 day after the event .",
    "@xmath1 band ccd photometry from iao was carried out using the optical ccd imager on the recently installed 2-m telescope .",
    "the telescope was installed in september 2000 and is undergoing commissioning tests .",
    "details of the observatory and telescope may be obtained from _ http://www.iiap.ernet.in/iao and also anupama ( 2000 ) .",
    "the ccd imager is equipped with johnson - cousins @xmath19 filters ( see bessell 1990 ) and a @xmath20 site chip of 24@xmath21 m square pixels covering a field of @xmath22  arcmin at the f/9 cassegrain focus . on feb 22 ,",
    "four 600s exposures were obtained , while three 600s and two 300s exposures were obtained on feb 26 .",
    "the images recorded on feb 22 are slightly trailed due to tracking and guiding errors , but are usable .",
    "_      the ot was observed in the @xmath1 band on feb 22 and 23 using the 1-m zeiss telescope equipped with a ccd imager similar to that in use at iao .",
    "the total field covered at the f/13 cassegrain focus is @xmath23  arcmin .    using a ccd imager similar to the other two systems , at the f/3.25 prime focus of the 2.3 m vbt",
    ", the ot was observed in the @xmath1 and @xmath24 bands on feb 24 and 25 and in the @xmath1 band on feb 28 and mar 1 ( cowsik & bhargavi 2001 ) . the total field covered was @xmath25  arcmin .",
    "we describe in the following , the analysis of the iao and vbo 1-m data .",
    "the details of the vbt data analysis are presented in bhargavi ( 2001 ) .",
    "all images were bias subtracted using the mean value of the nearest bias frames and flatfield corrected using a master flat generated by combining several twilight flats . often a few processed frames were aligned and combined before extracting magnitudes in order to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "these frames are indicated in a single row of table 1 .",
    "it was not possible to perform a psf fitting to the data obtained from iao on feb 22 as the stellar profiles are affected by the tracking and guiding errors . in order to have a uniform mode of magnitude estimation for all sets of data ,",
    "magnitudes were obtained using aperture photometry and growth curve method ( howell 1989 ) .",
    "aperture photometry of the ot and several bright stars in the field was performed using concentric apertures ranging from 0.7 to 14 arcsec diameter centred on the object .",
    "sky background was subtracted using a 1.5 arcsec annulus with an inner radius of 58 arcsec for the ot and 810 arcsec for the brighter stars . based on a growth curve for the brighter stars ,",
    "a 67 arcsec aperture was chosen for the photometric measurements to include most of the light from the source .",
    "the ot being faint , its magnitude estimated from the 34 arcsec aperture .",
    "corrections for the photons from the source outside this aperture were made using a correction factor estimated from the growth curve of the brighter stars ( average of henden 5 , 16 , 18 , 27 ) .",
    "the zero points were determined using star ` a ' of stanek et al .",
    "( 2001b ) whose magnitude was assumed to be @xmath26 following henden ( 2001b ) .",
    "the magnitudes of other stars in the field were compared with henden s photometry to ascertain that no systematic errors exist between the two data sets .",
    "a colour transformation equation was determined for residuals of the field stars with respects to henden s photometry using henden 5 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 25 , 33 ( vbo ) or 7 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 18 , 20 ( iao ) .",
    "the bluest star henden 18 was not used at vbo since it showed that the colour equation is nonlinear below @xmath27 . since the ot had a colour of @xmath28 ( masetti et al 2001 )",
    ", the nonlinearity does not affect the results .",
    "the zero - point correction to the field star photometry , together with the colour correction , resulted in a total correction ranging between 0.014 and 0.022 mag for different frames .",
    "the details of observations and derived magnitudes are listed in table 1 and plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath1 band light curve of the ot of grb 010222 is obtained using magnitudes from the following sources : ( 1 ) iao and vbo magnitudes reported in this paper ( vbo1 = 1-m telescope ; vbt = 2.34-m telescope ) , ( 2 ) sampurnanand telescope ( st ) observations reported by sagar et al .",

    "all these magnitudes are listed in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath1 light curve shows a broken power - law behaviour with the first phase ending around 10 hours after which the decline became steeper .",
    "the curves before and after the break can be fit by power laws @xmath29 where the time @xmath30 is measured from the time of grb detection , _ i.e.  _ 2001 february 22.3080 ( piro 2001 ) , and @xmath31 is the time of break in the curve .",
    "the power law exponents for the two phases are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "two linear @xmath34-fits were obtained against @xmath35 using the magnitudes in table 2 . in order to obtain the asymptotic behaviour ,",
    "the points close to the break between @xmath30 = 0.3  0.8  d were excluded .",

    "the degrees of freedom ( @xmath39 ) are also shown .",
    "the fits are shown in fig .  2 by straight lines .    the following smooth empirical function ( cf .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ) is often used to fit light curves of optical transients of grbs .",
    "@xmath40^{-\\frac{1}{s}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is a sharpness parameter and increases as the break becomes sharper .",
    "we find that such a curve does not describe the data in table 2 well .",
    "we obtain a good fit if we exclude the region @xmath30 = 0.3  0.8 d as shown in model 2 of table 3 .",
    "the @xmath34 reduces considerably as @xmath42 increases until @xmath43 and decreases very slowly thereafter .",
    "we have shown the fit for @xmath44 by a dotted curve in fig .  2 .",
    "the constraint on smoothness also tends to increase the slope before the break and decrease it after the break . while the smooth fit provides smaller formal errors on the parameters , there is no specific reason to prefer the asymptotic values resulting from this fit to the values derived by linear fits away from the break .",
    "figure 2 shows systematic deviation of the points away from the break which can be reduced only by increasing the value of @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "a large value of @xmath42 recovers the slopes fit by separate straight lines .",
    "the light curve parameters derived above may be compared with the values derived by masetti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 d , and @xmath48 .",
    "sagar et al ( 2001 ) derive a slightly steeper fit with @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and the break @xmath52 considerably later than derived here , but in agreement with stanek et al ( 2001a ) : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , though with a much sharper break ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "there appears a drop in the light curve with respect to both the fits around feb 23.0 .",
    "the observations of iao and upso both agree in this behaviour ( see inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the vbo 1-m magnitudes have large errors and the deviations are not apparent .",
    "the favoured model for grb afterglows is synchrotron or inverse compton scattering of electrons accelerated in a relativistic shock wave expanding in its surrounding medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "the shock decelerates as it sweeps up ambient matter and the emission fades down .",
    "a steepening of the light curve has been observed in the optical transients of several grb sources and has been generally explained either through expansion in a dense medium or in terms of collimated outflows ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the latter ( jet ) model is of special interest since it reduces the total energy requirement and increases the actual rate of occurrence of such events .",
    "according to this model , the hydrodynamics of the relativistic jet is not influenced by the finite angular size during the early evolution when the bulk lorentz factor @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the opening angle of the jet in radians . in this case",
    ", the light curve behaves similar to the isotropic expansion .",
    "however , when @xmath58 , the sideways expansion of the jet becomes significant and the light curve becomes steeper .",
    "the break in the light curve is expected at @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the isotropic energy of the ejecta in the units of @xmath61 ergs , @xmath62 is the ambient particle density in @xmath63 , assumed to be homogeneous ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) . with @xmath64 in the observer s frame ,",
    "we derive @xmath65^{\\frac{3}{8 } } \\bigg(\\frac{n_1}{e_{52}}\\bigg)^{\\frac{1}{8}}.\\ ] ] for an isotropic energy of @xmath66 ( int zand et al 2001 ) , the observed value of @xmath67 h , implies a beam angle in the range of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath62 and @xmath60 is rather weak .",
    "the narrow beam angle ( @xmath72 for @xmath69 ) implies that such outbursts actually occur at a rate 1500 times higher than observed .",
    "this is not much higher than inferred for average grbs with slightly wider beam angles , which has already triggerred an interest to look for their remnants in the local universe ( paczyski 2001 ) .",
    "the models of the evolution of the outflow also predict a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a peak either at the characteristic synchrotron frequency ( @xmath73 ) or at the cooling frequency ( @xmath74 ) depending on whether the cooling is slow or fast ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "the spectrum would be self - absorbed below a frequency @xmath75 which generally lies in the radio region .",
    "the shape of the spectrum and its time evolution can be determined by a single parameter @xmath76 , the electron power law distribution index , assuming adiabatic expansion , or expansion of a jet in a homogeneous medium and neglecting the dust extinction .",
    "the shape and decay rate of the optical spectrum would then depend on its location with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "we assume in the following that the spectrum is dominated by synchrotron rather than inverse compton scattering and reached the slow cooling phase well before the break in the light curve .",
    "kulkarni et al ( 2001 ) report a 350 ghz detection of the ot on feb 22.54 at @xmath77 mjy .",
    "it was detected at 22 ghz a little later ( feb 22.62 ) with a flux of @xmath78 mjy ( berger & frail 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 band flux at these times based on our fit are : 0.110 mjy ( feb 22.54 ) and 0.093 mjy ( feb 22.62 ) .",
    "the 220 ghz detections on feb 23 and 24 ( kulkarni et al 2001 ) are slightly lower than expected from these two points . based on these observations ,",
    "@xmath73 is estimated to be in the sub - mm region just before the break .",
    "further , the 350 ghz as well as 220 ghz flux remained nearly constant between feb 22.54 and 24.68 ( kulkarni et al 2001 ) .",
    "such a behaviour is expected when the peak frequency is passing through this spectral region .",
    "kulkarni et al ( 2001 ) hypothesized that most of the sub - mm flux arises from the host galaxy , either from starburst regions , or due to reprocessing of grb radiation .",
    "in such an event , the sub - mm flux of the ot will be lower and the peak could be placed at higher frequencies .",
    "it has been suggested by lee et al ( 2001 ) that the break in @xmath1 band decay may be caused by the passage of @xmath73 through this spectral region .",
    "the @xmath79 magnitudes reported by masetti et al ( 2001 ) around 12 days after the outburst show little variation with time .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath73 was passing through this region around day 1.0 , considering that it drops as @xmath80 in the adiabatic expansion phase , it could have passed through the optical region around the time of the break . however , the light curves of masetti et al ( 2001 ) appear fairly achromatic despite limited data in the early phase and thus there is no strong indication of @xmath73 passing through the optical region .    if we consider the possibility that @xmath81 , we expect @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the observed slopes yield two estimates of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , considerably harder than the value of 2.4 obtained for several other grbs . the optical spectrum",
    "is then predicted to vary as @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the two estimates of @xmath88 would then be @xmath89 and @xmath90 , considerably flatter than observed .    if we assume , on the other hand , that @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the derived values of @xmath76 are @xmath94 and @xmath95 with the spectral index @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "these values are more consistent with each other and can be reconciled with the observed optical spectrum considering that extinction in the host galaxy would modify this spectral region ( lee et al 2001 ) .",
    "the 350 ghz flux decayed from @xmath98 mjy on feb 24.68 ( kulkarni et al 2001 ) to @xmath99 mjy on march 2 ( ivison et al 2001 ) .",
    "if all the flux is attributed to the grb , the deduced decay index is @xmath100 = 1.52 which is numerically equal to @xmath76 in the jet model .",
    "the 210 kev flux also decayed with @xmath100 = 1.33 beginning a couple of hours before the break to 2.4 days after the break ( int zand et al 2001 ) .",
    "the expressions for the decay rate exponents derived by sari , piran & halpern ( 1999 ) assume an electron power law index of @xmath101 .",
    "bhattacharya ( 2001 ) has derived expressions for the case of @xmath102 12 assuming that there is an upper cutoff in the electron energy spectrum at @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the bulk lorentz factor of the blast wave , and a single power law between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the decay rate exponents can then be derived in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath107 .",
    "assuming that @xmath108 where @xmath109 is another critical frequency associated with @xmath106 , eqs ( 26 ) and ( 28 ) of bhattacharya ( 2001 ) imply @xmath110 since @xmath111 has been determined well , we derive @xmath112 using this relation , and derive a value of @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "dai & cheng ( 2001 ) , on the other hand , assumed a flat electron energy spectrum that gets steeper after the cooling break at @xmath115 , and deduced that the light curve of the jet would decay as @xmath116 irrespective of the value of @xmath76 as long as it is between 12 .",
    "observations are at variance with this model suggesting that either the jet model is not applicable , or the electron energy spectrum has a different shape .",
    "it thus appears likely that the electron energy spectrum was considerably harder ( @xmath117 ) for grb 010222 compared to typical grbs ( @xmath118 ) exhibiting steeper decay in the optical .",
    "sagar et al ( 2001 ) also reached a similar conclusion from the spectral slope assuming @xmath119 .",
    "a similar hard spectrum was suggested by panaitescu ( 2001 ) for grb 000301c whose spectrum around the light curve break shows a good resemblance with grb 010222 .",
    "the light curve of grb 010222 is not well - observed between the time it was lost to the pacific coast and later when it was recaptured from the indian observatories .",
    "the early observations from iao and st suggest that the light curve had a significant dip with respect to the power law after the break .",
    "similar deviations were also seen in the case of grb 000301c and were attributed by berger et al ( 2000 ) to the inhomogeneities in the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "these authors have argued that the flux above @xmath75 would vary with ambient density as @xmath120 .",
    "thus the brightness would increase when the shock overtakes denser regions and dip when it reaches lower density regions .",
    "wang & loeb ( 2000 ) and ruffini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have considered the effects of inhomogeneities in the interstellar matter on the radiation from the afterglow in somewhat greater detail .",
    "they find that variations are expected over timescales of seconds or tens of seconds when the bulk lorentz factor is high ( @xmath121 ) and increase to days when the lorentz factor reduces to @xmath122 , if one assumes that the shock propagates through a medium similar to the local interstellar matter .",
    "the observed @xmath1 magnitudes of grb 010222 between 14 and 17 hours since the outburst depart from the power law by @xmath123 mag including all the data in table 2 , and @xmath124 mag if we consider only the iao and st estimates which have an average error of 0.027 mag ( see inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the 0.1 mag depression in the light curve can easily be caused by a 20% decrease in the ambient density .",
    "the rms fluctuation of 0.06 mag , though statistically not very significant , can be caused by density fluctuations of little over 10% .",
    "the iao and st observations have a mean interval of 0.6 hours .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor has a value of about 20 at this epoch , at which time , density fluctuations of @xmath125 of 13 over 100 au length scales and 0.10.2 over 1000 au length scales can produce fluctuations of 0.05 mag amplitude over timescales of an hour .",
    "the values of density contrast are consistent with the inhomogeneities in the local interstellar medium ( lauroesch & meyer 1999 ) .",
    "the observed column densities of @xmath126 @xmath15 imply a total path length of 300  pc for @xmath127 , comparable to the thickness of disks of galaxies .",
    "we thus suspect that grb 010222 occurred in a normal interstellar environment .",
    "fluctuations are not noticed in the light curves of most grb afterglows suggesting that the ambient medium is considerably smooth around them . on the other hand ,",
    "structure is evident over timescales of tens of seconds in the batse observations ( see int zand et al in case of grb 010222 ) which can be attributed to interstellar density fluctuations ( ruffini et al .",
    "future grb afterglows may be monitored more systematically with a view to probing the stucture of the ambient medium .",
    "the @xmath1 band photometry of the ot of grb 010222 performed with the telescopes at iao , hanle and vbo , kavalur is presented here . these measurements together with the photometry reported in the literature show that the @xmath1 band light curve of grb 010222 had a sharp break at 10 hours from the outburst with decay rates 0.542 and 1.263 before and after the break .",
    "the light curve shows some evidence of fluctuations soon after the break .",
    "it is suggested that the variations are caused by the inhomogeneities in the ambient medium .",
    "following the standard models of collimated jet outflow , the early break in the light curve implies that the beam had a very narrow opening angle of @xmath128 .",
    "this is probably the narrowest observed for any grb so far .",
    "we are greatly indebted to the 2-m telescope project team which helped in the procurement and installation of the telescope at the high altitude site in less than 3 years , and developed all the necessary infrastructure including the enclosure , power supply , liquid nitrogen supply , and communication link to hosakote near bangalore for remote operation and downloading the data .",
