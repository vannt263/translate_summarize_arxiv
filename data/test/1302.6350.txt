    "interstellar shocks are seen in association with various astrophysical objects , from wind - blowing massive stars @xcite , mass - ejecting giant stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , expanding supernova remnants ( snrs ; e.g. , @xcite ) , to energetic pulsars @xcite . in these objects , fast moving ejecta collide with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the strong interaction drives a shock front . depending on the kinetic energy carried into the shock and local ism conditions , the postshock hot material can be bright at different wavelengths .",
    "observations of shocks not only help study shock physics , but also provide probes of the associated objects and ism .",
    "depending on temperature @xmath3 , the sound speed @xmath4 in the ism [ @xmath5 km s@xmath6 is in the range of 1100 km s@xmath7 . as a result ,",
    "when stellar objects have high space velocities @xmath8 , they can be moving supersonically in the ism .",
    "in such cases , a shock will appear as a cometary structure ( so - called bow shock ) , as interstellar material is swept up into a dense cone - type shell ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one type of bow shock is known to be associated with pulsars . having space velocities of @xmath9100 km s@xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and strong winds ( which carry much of the spin - down energy @xmath10 of pulsars ) , pulsars moving in the ism are candidates to drive bow shocks .",
    "thus far , six pulsars have been found to have a typical bow shock , revealed by the shocks optical balmer line emission @xcite .",
    "the detected line nebulae are understood to arise from de - excitations of neutral h atoms in the shocked ambient gas , following the processes of collisional excitation or charge - exchange ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , a pulsar bow shock may also be revealed by the detection of a termination shock of the pulsar wind .",
    "the termination shock lies inside a bow shock , and can appear bright at x - ray or radio energies due to synchrotron radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in our _ spitzer _  infrared array camera ( irac ) survey of 7 relatively young pulsars , for the purpose of probing the general existence of debris disks around isolated neutron stars ( wang et al .",

    "several bright stars in the target field caused column pull - down , row pull - up , or optical banding artifacts .",

    "we first combined all the sky bcd images into one master sky image and subtracted this master image from each of the target bcd images .",

    "in addition for the nir data , a sky image was made by filtering out stars from each set of dithered images in one observation .",
    "the sky image was subtracted from the set of images , and then the sky - subtracted images were shifted and combined into one final image of the target field .",
    "the pointing of the irac frames is typically accurate to 05 . in order to determine",
    "more accurately the position of the cometary nebula and locate j1549  on the images , we astrometrically calibrated the irac 8.0 @xmath1 m image by matching stars detected in this image to two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) stars . for this calibration ,",
    "190 2mass stars were used .",
    "the nominal uncertainty of the calibrated image is dominated by the 2mass systematic uncertainty ( @xmath12015 , with respect to the international celestial reference system ) .",
    "the other images were also positionally calibrated by matching them to the 8.0 @xmath1 m image .",
    "we studied the cometary structure by semi - quantitatively determining its shape .",
    "the 8.0 @xmath1 m image was used for the detailed study because it has the best resolution among the _ spitzer _  and wise detections .",
    "we first removed all point sources near the cometary structure . using the software package apex ( multi - frame extraction ) provided by ssc",
    ", point sources in the field were identified and subtracted from each bcd image .",
    "the residual frames were then combined into a pbcd mosaic , which is shown in figure  [ fig : bow ] .",
    "we then manually selected small regions along the three parts of the nebula : the two wings and the head region .",
    "narrow box regions set parallel to the three nebula parts were defined , with each box having a length@xmath11width of 5@xmath111 pixel@xmath16 ( 61@xmath1112 ) .",
    "photons within each box were counted and the uncertainty on the photon counts was estimated as the square - root of the total counts . this way",
    "a brightness curve that was perpendicular to the narrow box regions ( or to the nebula parts ) was obtained . using a gaussian function",
    ", we performed least - squares fitting to the brightness curve and thus determined the location of a brightness peak point .",
    "the uncertainty for each location was also estimated from the fitting . in total 19 such brightness peak points",
    "were determined ( see figure  [ fig : bow ] ) .",
    "we obtained the flux of the head region of the cometary nebula at each band .",
    "a circular region with a radius of 21 , which well covers the head region , was used as the photometry aperture .",
    "a box region of 80@xmath1150  near the head was used for estimating the sky background brightness .",
    "for photometry at 8.0 @xmath1 m , aperture correction was required because irac imaging uses point sources for flux calibration .",
    "we used the function form provided by ssc to calculate the correction factor and found a value of 0.83 for a radius of 21 .",
    "the flux value at 8.0 @xmath1 m is the measured flux value times the correction factor .",
    "we also derived the flux upper limit for the 4.5 @xmath1 m non - detection , because the deep image provides an additional constraint on mir emission from the cometary nebula .",
    "following the guidelines given for aperture photometry on the wise atlas images , wise w3 and w4 fluxes were also obtained .",
    "the broad - band flux measurements and 4.5 @xmath1 m upper limit are given in table  1 .",
    "the shape of the ir cometary nebula indicates that it is likely a typical bow shock .",
    "the location of the associated object that drives the ir nebula can thus be estimated by fitting the nebula with a standard bow - shock shape , since the distance from an associated object to the apex of the associated bow shock ( so - called  standoff distance \" ) sets the length scale of the bow shock .",
    "we considered an analytic solution derived by @xcite , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the distance between the bow shock shell and the associated object , @xmath20 is the polar angle from the axis of symmetry ( i.e. , the associated object s moving direction ) , and @xmath21 is the standoff distance . with this solution",
    ", we fit the positions of the brightness peak points obtained in ",
    "[ subsec : mor ] .",
    "the free parameters in the fitting were @xmath22 , @xmath23 location of the associated object , @xmath21 , and the rotation angle of the axis of the bow shock in the plane of the sky . to simplify the fitting",
    ", we assumed that the axis of symmetry of the bow shock lies nearly in the plane of the sky ( note that an inclination angle such as 60  will result in a smaller projected distance between the associated object and the ` apparent ' apex of the bow shock ) .",
    "the obtained ( 3@xmath24 ) region in which the associated object is located is indicated as a dotted contour in figure  [ fig : bow ] .",
    "it is a small region very close to the head of the cometary nebula , and approximately 15  away from j1549  ( whose position is r.a .",

    "= @xmath04848374 , equinox j2000.0 , and has an uncertainty of @xmath121 ; @xcite ) . because the data points of the brightness peaks do not provide tight constraints along the axis of symmetry ,",
    "the region is more extended along this direction .",
    "the best - fit location and bow shock solution are shown as a plus sign and a dashed curve , respectively , in figure  [ fig : bow ] . as can be seen",
    ", the standard bow shock shape generally fits the data points , although the tail of the nebula is wider , deviating away from the model . from the best fit ( @xmath27=14 for 15 degrees of freedom ) , we found @xmath28 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] , we show the broad - band and _ spitzer _  irs spectrum of the head region of the cometary nebula , which is dereddened with @xmath29 @xcite using the interstellar extinction laws given by @xcite for wavelengths @xmath308 @xmath1 m and by @xcite for wavelengths @xmath318 @xmath1 m",
    "spitzer_/irac 4.5 @xmath1 m flux upper limit is also included .",
    "the irs spectrum was flux calibrated by equaling the average value of its 7.58.5 @xmath1 m region to the irac 8.0 @xmath1 m broad - band flux value .",
    "a few emission lines were detected in the irs spectrum , which are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) 11.3 , 8.6 , and likely 7.6 @xmath1 m .",
    "these pah lines are commonly seen in many emission nebulae and arise from vibrational modes of pah in dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two h@xmath2 rotational lines were also detected , although weakly .",
    "they are h@xmath2s(3 ) 9.7 @xmath1 m and h@xmath2s(2 ) 12.3  @xmath1 m . in general ,",
    "h@xmath2 lines are associated with photodissociation regions ( pdrs ; e.g. , @xcite ) or shock interaction regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the broad dip at @xmath139.7 @xmath1 m is not the well - known silicate absorption feature .",
    "rather , its appearance is caused by the nearby strong pah emission features @xcite .",
    "the total galactic reddening along the line of sight to the source is only approximately @xmath29 ( for @xmath32=3305 , @xmath33=43 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the dip is caused by interstellar reddening , @xmath34 should be @xmath35 , which is too large to be consistent with those estimated from the all - sky dust @xcite or neutral hydrogen density @xcite maps . also , as shown below in this section ,",
    "the local column density of the cometary nebula is much lower than that implied by the reddening @xmath36 .",
    "we first tested using a simple dust grain model @xcite to reproduce the spectrum we obtained .",
    "this model was developed to explain the observed ir emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) , in which dust grains are heated both by collisions with ambient thermal gas and by radiation flux , and could work for the ir nebula in our case .",
    "considering the general case that the grains absorption / emission efficiency decreases as @xmath37 , we found that two components with temperatures of @xmath38 k and @xmath39 k ( assuming a simplified , uniform grain size of radius 0.1 @xmath1 m ) , can generally describe the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the dust masses thus simply estimated are 1.0@xmath40  g and 1.9@xmath41  g , respectively , where @xmath42 is the source distance in units of kpc .    to better reproduce the irs spectrum , a detailed model including pah particles is needed .",
    "we considered the model spectra derived and provided by @xcite , although we note that in their model , dust grains are heated by a field of starlight .",
    "according to their calculations , for the case of dust grains being heated by a single radiation intensity , the flux ratio between 24 and 70 @xmath1 m is mainly sensitive to radiation with energy density per unit frequency @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) estimated by @xcite for the solar neighborhood and @xmath45 is a dimensionless scaling factor .",
    "we thus found that @xmath46 is required for our data points .",
    "however , the @xmath46 model spectra have much stronger pah features than those in our irs spectrum ( even with the lowest pah mass fraction @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is found to be applicable to the dust in the milky way ) . in order to have a good fit to the irs spectrum",
    ", we found that the dust should be heated by a single radiation intensity , @xmath49 , plus by a power - law distribution of starlight intensities ranging from @xmath4910@xmath50 ( where @xmath48 , the power - law index @xmath51 is fixed , @xmath52 , and the fraction of the dust mass that is exposed to the distribution of starlight intensities is @xmath53 ; cf . equation ( 23 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this model spectrum is displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] , which generally describes the pah features in our spectrum . as a result",
    ", the dust mass @xmath54 can be estimated from the total value of the 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath1 m fluxes ( cf . equation ( 34 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "since no flux measurement at 160 @xmath1 m was obtained , @xmath54 should be @xmath55  g and @xmath56  g when assuming the flux at 160 @xmath1 m is equal to that at 70@xmath1 m .",
    "the value range is consistent with that derived above from the simple dust grain model .",
    "we further estimated the properties of the head region of the bow shock .",
    "considering again the dust size of 0.1 @xmath1 m ( and density of 3 g  @xmath57 ; @xcite ) , the total luminosities in the region were 5.7@xmath58 and 1.1@xmath59 erg  s@xmath7 for the 250  k and 55  k dust grains , respectively . simply assuming that the head region is a 21  radius ( or 0.1@xmath42 pc ) sphere , the number density ( dominated by the cold dust grains ) can be estimated to be @xmath1390 @xmath57 , where a mass ratio of 1 to 100 between the dust to gas is used @xcite .      in order to search for possible line emission from the bow shock ,",
    "we made both @xmath14 and @xmath60 imaging observations of the target field with the magellan telescopes ; the wide - band image was used to serve as the continuum flux .",
    "we did not detect any @xmath60 nebula in our observations .",
    "both optical @xmath14- and @xmath60-band images of the target field are shown in figure  [ fig : bowrh ] .",
    "the @xmath14-band detection limit was @xmath1323 mag , and the @xmath60 flux upper limit ( 3@xmath24 ) was 2.9@xmath61 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath62arcsec@xmath63 .",
    "provided with the results we have obtained from the above analyses , we discuss the possible origin of this bow shock by first considering a stellar object and then j1549  as the associated star .          as shown by our analysis in ",
    "[ subsec : loo ] , considering an isotropic wind / outflow from an object @xcite , the location of the associated object would likely be within a small area near the head region of the bow shock , which is more than 15  away from psr  j1549 .",
    "such ir bow shocks can be driven by either massive stars with a strong wind @xcite or giant stars ejecting mass @xcite , as long as the associated stars are moving supersonically in the ism .",
    "the stand - off distance of such a bow shock is given by @xmath64 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath65 is the mass loss rate , @xmath66 is the wind velocity , and @xmath67 is the density of the ism . for a massive o / b star with typical values of @xmath68  yr@xmath7 , @xmath69  km  s@xmath7 , and @xmath70  km  s@xmath7 ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , the required ambient ism hydrogen density to produce the observed bow shock is @xmath71 @xmath57 , where @xmath72 is the mass loss rate in units of @xmath73  yr@xmath7 , @xmath74 is the wind velocity in units of 1000  km  s@xmath7 , and @xmath75 is the star s space velocity in units of 30  km  s@xmath7 . here",
    "we have used @xmath76  cm and @xmath77 with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is the mean nucleus number per hydrogen atom and @xmath80 is the mass of the hydrogen nucleus ) . using the low end value of @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see below for a discussion of the distance ) , along with the other mass - loss parameters given above , we find @xmath83 , broadly consistent with values expected for the ism density .",
    "alternatively , for a giant star with mass ejection , @xmath84  km  s@xmath7 and other parameters similar to those above ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the required ambient density is @xmath85 ; reasonable adjustments to the parameters can easily lead to values more consistent with the ism density .",
    "these calculations thus show that it is possible to have either a massive star or a giant star with mass ejection as the object that drives the bow shock .",
    "however we evaluated the possible association of the bow shock with any in - field stars and obtained negative results .",
    "first there were no stars detected in the associated object region in our optical images down to @xmath86 ( see figure  [ fig : bowrh ] ) .",
    "we also analyzed the nearby stars by constructing a color - magnitude diagram of @xmath17 versus @xmath87 ( figure  [ fig : rk ] ) .",
    "as can be seen , the stars are consistent with being low - mass main sequence stars ( or white dwarfs ) at distances of @xmath882.5 kpc . massive or giant stars would have to be at distances of @xmath136 kpc and @xmath1310 kpc , respectively , and approximately 0.50.8 kpc away from the galactic plane , a place not likely to form bow shocks due to the low density of the ism .",
    "the detection of h@xmath2 lines in the irs spectrum suggests that the associated object should probably be @xmath89 kpc away from the galatic plane , since molecular gas generally inhabits within the mid - plane of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "given their high space velocities ( @xmath9100 km s@xmath7 ) and strong winds , pulsars can naturally drive bow shocks in the ism .",
    "detections of bow shocks around pulsars at multiple wavelength ranges have provided sufficient evidence for it @xcite . the existence of ir bow shocks , arising due to irradiation or collisional heating , can be expected .",
    "the pulsar j1549  has a spin - down energy of @xmath90 erg s@xmath7 and a distance of 1.5 kpc @xcite , implying that if it were associated with the bow shock , approximately 1.6% of the energy is used to illuminate the dust , which is a reasonable fraction to consider ( note the total luminosity from the head of the bow shock is @xmath91 erg s@xmath7 at the distance of 1.5 kpc ) .",
    "on the other hand , the pulsar s kinematic energy can also contribute to dust heating . considering a radius @xmath92  pc ( the head region we have defined when the distance is 1.5 kpc ) interaction area ,",
    "the energy received by the ambient medium is @xmath93 erg  s@xmath7 , where @xmath94 @xmath57 and @xmath95 km  s@xmath7 , the pulsar s velocity , are used .",
    "therefore there is sufficient energy to illuminate the bow shock .",
    "the obvious challenge to this interpretation is j1549 s location , which is at least 15   ( or 0.11 pc if at the pulsar s distance ) away from the determined area for the associated object of the bow shock .",
    "however , we note that a pulsar wind can be highly anisotropic and for peculiar cases , long jet - like outflows have been detected from pulsars @xcite .",
    "calculations for such anisotropic wind cases to produce bow shocks have been considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one feature that has been revealed is the off - axis location of an associated star if the star s wind points away from the direction of the stellar motion , for which the star s location would otherwise be determined to lie in the apparent axis of symmetry when simply fitting the stand - off region @xcite .",
    "@xcite did further detailed simulations by considering the anisotropy of pulsar winds for pulsar bow shocks , and have shown that a variety of shape changes with respect to the ` standard ' shape of bow shocks .",
    "in particular , the broadening of the tails of the bow shocks in their simulations sa and sb ( see figure 13 in their paper ) , when a pulsar runs through a wall of the high - density ism with finite width , is possibly observed in our case ( see figure  [ fig : bow ] ) .",
    "we thus did test fitting to our cometary nebula by using equation a11 given in @xcite , an analytic solution for jet - like outflows ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 were simply set to be 0 , 0 , and 5 , where @xmath96 sets the angle between the directions of the pulsar s wind and its motion ; for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit solution ( @xmath99 for 15 degrees of freedom ) is shown in figure  [ fig : bow ] , which is nearly the same as that found in section  [ subsec : loo ] .",
    "the allowed 3@xmath24 region for the associated object is however substantially elongated toward j1549 .",
    "while the pulsar is still 5.8   away from the region , the fitting results suggest that it may be possible for the pulsar to drive the bow shock if it had a highly - collimated wind and the wind were tilted away from the direction of the pulsar s motion . in order to fully explore this possibility , detailed hydrodynamic simulations , such as those carried out by @xcite ,",
    "are needed .",
    "in addition , if j1549  did have a highly collimated pulsar wind , the interaction of its wind with the ambient medium could be detectable at x - ray energies .",
    "x - ray imaging should be carried out to search for the interaction , which would lie from j1549  to the stand - off region of the ir nebula , thus verifying the association of the pulsar with the nebula .",
    "the bow shock has a direction towards the galactic plane ( figure  [ fig : field ] ) , implying that the associated object is moving in the same direction .",
    "high - spatial resolution radio imaging of the pulsar , to detect its proper motion , should also be carried out . if j1549  is also moving in this direction , its chance of being associated with the bow shock would be substantially increased .",
    "we have discovered an ir bow shock around the pulsar j1549 , and from our follow - up imaging and spectroscopic observations and wise all - sky survey data , a composite spectrum of its head region from 8 to 70 @xmath1 m , which includes a _ spitzer _",
    "irs 7.514.4 @xmath1 m spectrum , was obtained . in the irs spectrum , a few pah and h@xmath2 emission features were detected .",
    "considering the overall spectrum with these features , the emission likely arises from the dust grains in the interaction region heated by collisions and/or radiation flux from the associated object .",
    "the dust mass in the region was estimated to be 2@xmath1110@xmath100  g. we analyzed the shape of the bow shock by fitting with a standard analytic solution for such objects , and the derived region in which the associated object would be located is 15  away from j1549 .",
    "this raises the question of which object drives this bow shock .",
    "no stars were detected in the associated object region down to @xmath101 , and moreover our studies of the in - field stars indicate that none of them are likely bright o / b stars or red giants located near the galactic plane , which are able to drive such bow shocks due to their strong winds or mass ejection .",
    "given the considered properties of pulsar winds , including a few peculiar pulsar jet - like outflows , we suggest that it is possible for j1549  to be associated with the ir bow shock if it had a highly collimated wind .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of such a wind with the ism can help explore this possibility .",
    "in addition , x - ray imaging to detect the interaction of its wind with the ambient medium and high - spatial resolution radio imaging to detect the proper motion of the pulsar will help verify their association .",
