    "mass , radius , and luminosity are some of the most interesting properties of a star .",
    "unfortunately , it is non - linear combinations of them that produce quasi - linear changes on a stellar spectrum .",
    "stellar fluxes are commonly interpreted in terms of atmospheric temperature , pressure , and chemical composition . in the context of classical flux - constant model atmospheres ,",
    "these fields are simply specified with three scalars : the effective temperature , the surface gravity , and a solar - scaled metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , extracting the three from an observed spectrum is rarely trivial .",
    "a spectroscopic classification system has been developed independently of the physical parameters .",
    "the mk system ( morgan , keenan & kellman 1943 ) lays out a series of rules to assign spectral classes from medium - low resolution spectra .",
    "this method has the advantage of providing a standard reference independent of models .",
    "however , it is somewhat artificial , in the sense that the defined spectral classes are obviously correlated with the relevant atmospheric parameters .",
    "moreover , the classical mk system does not provide for metal - poor stars .",
    "one may note , as an example , that the metal - poor giant hd 122563 , which has an effective temperature around 4600 k , has been often classified as a late - f or early - g type star . on the other hand ,",
    "classification methods based on physical parameters are more natural , but model - dependent .",
    "both the mk and the _ physical _ classification systems have their own advantages , and this may be the reason why they still coexist .",
    "but , the fact that it is the physical parameters what is ultimately demanded for astronomical applications is shifting most of the recent research toward the direct extraction of those quantities .",
    "as recognized by many specialists , repeatability and high speed in spectroscopic stellar classification can only be achieved by using automatic methods .",
    "a recent discussion of the most used methods can be found in bailer - jones ( 2001 ) .",
    "derived stellar parameters may differ when determined from different wavelength ranges or spectral features . among other reasons ,",
    "this may be caused by using models that are too simplistic .",
    "as the parameters will be derived from their expected effect on the spectra , inaccurate predictions , or neglect of other relevant parameters , will bias the results .",
    "details in the implementation of a classification procedure are also a reason to worry .",
    "the wide range of effective temperatures that have been assigned to the metal - poor subgiant hd 140283 in the recent literature serves as testimony of the respectable uncertainties still involved in the scale of effective temperatures ( see , e.g. , the discussion in snider et al . 2001 ) .",
    "discrepancies produced by interpreting stellar spectra with model atmospheres that are too simple will decrease as progress in theory takes place . for main - sequence stars , remarkable advances are happening as efforts focus on relaxing the assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "systematic differences that arise in the implementation of different methods for spectroscopic classification can be controlled by establishing standards",
    ". a reference implementation would be far more powerful than a set of standard stars .",
    "modern information technologies have paved the way for implementing a public automatic classification system accessible over the internet . such open system , if reliable and fast , could serve as a standard reference .",
    "this paper discusses the first steps toward the implementation of a prototype for an open classification system .",
    "this work will only deal with a section of the hr diagram ; stars with spectral types a to k and scaled solar metal abundances .",
    "section 2 describes the selected wavelength band ,  3 the working parameters space , and  4 provides details of the implementation .",
    "section 5 is devoted to connecting the parameters derived from spectroscopy to a widely accepted scale of effective temperatures based on the infrared flux method , and checking the performance of the method .",
    "section 6 concludes with a summary of present results and ideas for subsequent work .",
    "when using equivalent widths and classical flux - constant model atmospheres in abundance analyses , the relevant parameters can be usually reduced to four : the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) , the surface gravity ( @xmath3 ) , the micro - turbulence ( @xmath4 ) , and the metal abundances  commonly considered proportional to the iron abundance . for stars with spectral types a - k ,",
    "the most useful and accessible observational probes for these parameters are the flux distribution and the spectral lines : excitation and ionization equilibrium of metals , the pressure - enhanced wings of strong metal lines , and the hydrogen lines .",
    "different procedures to derive stellar parameters rely on one or several of these indicators .    at this point",
    "we set aside potential difficulties to model some of the spectral features mentioned above .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers by dragon & mutschlecner ( 1980 ) , castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997 ) , or bell , balachandran & bautista ( 2001 ) regarding the modelling of the continuum flux ; thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) or asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the calculation of fe i line profiles ; and fuhrmann , axer & gehren ( 1996 ) , gardiner , kupka & smalley ( 1999 ) , barklem , piskunov & omara ( 2000 ) , or cowley & castelli ( 2002 ) on modelling balmer lines . with the ultimate goal of deriving chemical abundances ,",
    "most spectroscopic observations aim at providing reliable line profiles or equivalent widths for lines of weak - to - moderate strength .",
    "ideally , one would use the same type of spectra to determine the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "in addition , accurate spectrophotometry is challenging and highly vulnerable to reddening . forcing the",
    "excitation and ionization equilibrium balance for metal lines is , in most cases , insufficient to reliably determine the quartet ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] @xmath6_{\\odot}$ ] , where @xmath7 represents the number density of the element e. ] , @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , we resort to a second feature , the balmer lines .",
    "we selected a continuous spectral window around h@xmath0 : 48104960  .",
    "this wavelength range represents a balance in many aspects .",
    "it is red enough that the continuum opacity is well described by h and h@xmath8 for the stars under consideration , avoiding the difficulties of dealing with much more complicated ( metal ) opacities , and it is blue enough that the presence of spectral lines makes possible a reliable determination of the metal abundance  even in metal - poor stars .",
    "use of equivalent widths , quantifying the strength of a spectral line by a single number , represents a loss of information .",
    "use of line profiles introduces more variables in the analysis through the different line broadening mechanisms .",
    "accounting for the broadening involves a number of difficulties in the practical implementation of a classification algorithm , although it also comes with extra information , e.g. projected rotational velocity , or instrument spectral resolution . at this point",
    "we wish to restrict the classification to ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath4 ) and , therefore , we use a fixed resolving power @xmath9 .",
    "we covered the selected spectral range with 301 points , equally spaced in wavelength ( every 0.5  ) .",
    "our choice of resolution is a compromise : low enough to make rotational and macro - turbulent broadening in late - type stars negligible , and high enough to be able to recover information on the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "1 shows observations for the sun ( solid ; kurucz et al .",
    "1984 ) , procyon ( dashed ; allende prieto et al . 2002 ) , and arcturus ( dash - dotted ; hinkle et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the most relevant features have been identified in the figure .    the range for each of the atmospheric parameters was selected to avoid some extreme conditions where classical model atmospheres in general , or those used here in particular , are expected , or known , to fail : cool temperatures at which the contribution of molecules to the equation of state is incomplete in the models ; hot temperatures at which departures from lte are important for the atmospheric structure ; or too extended an atmosphere that the plane - parallel approximation is inadequate .",
    "the selected domain is :    @xmath10 & $ \\le$ &   $ + 0.5 $ & dex \\\\ 0 & $ \\le$ &   $ \\xi$ & $ \\le$ &   2 & km s$^{-1}$. \\\\",
    "\\end{tabular}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    arcturus is probably cooler than our lower limit for @xmath2 [ griffin & lynas - gray ( 1999 ) assign @xmath11 k to this star ] , but it serves the purpose of showing an example of the coolest spectra in our working sample . as will become clear later , our raw @xmath2s are systematically higher than other scales and thus a star with this effective temperature is technically within the limits of our grid .",
    "extensive testing showed that the flux in the selected spectral window satisfies a one - to - one relationship with most of the parameters space .",
    "in other words , for a given combination of the four atmospheric parameters considered , the resulting flux in this window is unique . approaching the extreme metal - poor limit , below [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , degeneracy is unavoidable , as metal lines vanished , and so does the information on metallicity , gravity and microturbulence .",
    "the flux in the selected window is not equally sensitive to changes in the different stellar parameters .",
    "changes in @xmath2 affect the most the spectrum , followed by variations in the metal abundance .",
    "the effect of changes in the surface gravity is mainly felt through the different sensitivity of lines of neutral and ionized metals to pressure , and it is more subtle than the response to @xmath2 or [ fe / h ] .",
    "to find the set of parameters that best reproduces an observed spectrum , we need to choose an algorithm .",
    "we want to minimize ( or maximize ) a function of the stellar parameters .",
    "this will require us to evaluate a function  thus compute synthetic spectra  a number of times .",
    "this number can be very large , and therefore a strategy to reduce computing time is needed .",
    "we have tackled this problem by computing a discrete grid and interpolating .",
    "we adopted the following increments for the four parameters involved : 500 k in @xmath2 , 1.0 dex in @xmath5 , 1.0 dex in [ fe / h ] , and 1.0 km s@xmath13 in @xmath4 .",
    "these were chosen to keep the changes in the spectrum small enough so that a fast multilinear interpolation would provide a reasonable approximation .",
    "interpolation errors can reach up to 2 % for the warmer stars in the grid , but up to 7 % for the coolest metal - rich stars .",
    "these errors are smaller than the precision with which the real spectra can be reproduced , and it was later verified that use of a finer grid does not improve the performance of the classification method .",
    "we used a genetic algorithm ( ga ) to solve our minimization problem .",
    "gas are suitable for solving global optimization problems in complex landscapes where local extrema can confuse simpler algorithms ( see charbonneau 2002 for an informal introduction ) .",
    "the grid of synthetic spectra was based on non - overshooting kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres .",
    "these models include mixing - length convection with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the radiative transfer equation was solved with the code synspec ( hubeny & lanz 2000 ) , using very simple continuous opacities : h , h@xmath8 , rayleigh and electron scattering ( as described in hubeny 1988 ) .",
    "an atomic line list was prepared with the data obtained from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; kupka et al .",
    "this line list includes 7169 lines that are expected to contribute to the opacity in a solar - like atmosphere .",
    "the computed spectra were degraded to a resolving power of about 5000 , sampled with a common wavelength vector , and normalized .",
    "the presence of a very broad line in the spectral window ( @xmath16 ) makes normalization difficult .",
    "we have adopted a straightforward unsupervised polynomial normalization .",
    "although the results of this scheme would visually displease most stellar spectroscopists ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , this simple procedure can be carried out quickly , and repeatability is easily achieved for a given set ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath4 ) .",
    "in addition , the fluxes were also divided by a constant , 1.8 , to enforce flux values between 0 and 1  a requirement of the ga software .",
    "we implemented a fortran routine to perform multilinear interpolation in the four parameters under consideration .",
    "this routine is the interface between the grid of synthetic spectra and the genetic algorithm .",
    "the function we chose to maximize is :    @xmath17    where _ f _ is the vector of interpolated synthetic flux , _ o _ is the vector of observations , and the index _",
    "i _ indicates a particular wavelength bin .",
    "we adopted    @xmath18    as derived from the solar spectrum and a synthetic flux calculated with solar parameters , but reset to    @xmath19    the many necessary multilinear interpolations are very fast , as the grid of previously computed synthetic spectra is kept in memory .",
    "in fact , a non - negligible fraction of the time is invested in loading those data .",
    "we adopted a publicly available ga software , due to d. l. carroll ( see , e.g. , carroll 1996 ) .",
    "the default parameters were kept , namely , a micro - ga with uniform crossover .",
    "the ga was run for 500 generations .",
    "this number was chosen from inspection of the convergency curve for a limited number of stars , but it was later verified that increasing this value to 2000 generations did not produce any improvement in the performance .",
    "classification of a single spectrum takes about 3 seconds on a sun ultra5 .",
    "2 illustrates the agreement between the observed and the matched synthetic spectra for procyon , the sun , arcturus , and the metal - poor star hd 2665 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectrum of hd 2665 was obtained from the _ elodie _ library ( prugniel & soubiran 2001 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of h@xmath0 is an issue . even though the wings of balmer lines are considered to form very close to lte conditions , that does not apply to their cores .",
    "a tougher complication is the fact that balmer lines are commonly affected by the temperature distribution in the deepest atmospheric layers , which for late - type stars are significantly influenced by convection .",
    "convection is typically treated using a mixing - length formalism which implies a choice for one or several parameters .",
    "this represents an important additional source of uncertainty in the derived parameters  very likely a systematic bias in the derived @xmath2 .",
    "such a bias in @xmath2 , because of the tight coupling between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] , will also produce a bias in the other two parameters .",
    "in our view , the best possible option is to anchor our spectroscopic @xmath2 scale to a more reliable scale . the systematic effect in @xmath3 and [ fe / h ] implied by the necessary correction to our derived @xmath2 can be easily predicted .",
    "empirical studies have shown that a shift in an adopted @xmath2 will , through the iron excitation - ionization balance , translate to a shift in @xmath5 :    @xmath21    ( allende prieto 1998 ) , and a correction to [ fe / h ] :    @xmath22 } \\simeq \\frac{\\delta \\log g}{3.0}\\ ] ]    ( e.g. gray 1992 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "as we will be applying this correction to our @xmath2 scale , and the sensitivity to @xmath2 of the selected spectral region relies largely on the @xmath16 profile , there is no need to make a serious emphasis on the accuracy of the calculated absorption profile for h@xmath0 .",
    "we can make use of some approximations , and take advantage of a reduced computing time .",
    "in particular , we use an approximate broadening treatment described in the appendix b of hubeny , hummer & lanz ( 1994 ) .",
    "as this approach underestimates the width of the solar h@xmath0 profile , we apply a zeroth order correction , using twice the default value .",
    "this modification is not strictly necessary , as the correction to be applied later to the @xmath2 scale would be able to fix this zero point as well .",
    "we decided to anchor our spectroscopic @xmath2 scale to that of alonso , arribas & martnez - roger ( 1996 , 1999 ) , which is based on the infrared flux method , as modelled with fluxes from kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres .",
    "a library of high - resolution spectra recently published by prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) is used as testing field for our classification scheme .",
    "this library , hereafter the _ elodie _ library , consists of more than 908 spectra from 709 stars spanning a large fraction of , and in some instances exceeding , our parameter space .",
    "we determine the @xmath2 for each star using the alonso et al .",
    "calibrations for @xmath23 .",
    "these calibrations use @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] , and both parameters were adopted from those given in the _ elodie _ library .",
    "the division of the stars in iv - v or i - iii classes , in order to select the appropriate irfm calibration , is based on the gravities provided in the _ elodie _ library , setting the division line at @xmath24 .",
    "the spectra in the library with a resolution of @xmath25 are convolved with a gaussian profile with a fwhm of 1.0  , and then fed to our classification system to find a best - fitting vector ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath4 ) . then",
    ", the values derived for @xmath26 are compared against those from the irfm calibrations .",
    "the two scales are confronted in fig .",
    "3 . a second - order least - squares polynomial fit is adopted to anchor the derived @xmath26 to the irfm scale :    @xmath27    and this correction is also translated to @xmath5 , and [ fe / h ] , based on the correlation expected for the excitation - ionization balance ( see eqs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "3 reveals a tendency for some stars to clump at certain values of @xmath2 , in particular at @xmath28 k. too aggressive a choice for the steps in the grid parameters ( with the implied errors in the linear interpolation ) is not to blame for this systematic effect , which is related to caveats involved in the implementation of gas .",
    "noticeably , the scatter is not symmetrically distributed about the adopted mean relationship , defined by the polynomial fit .",
    "this is actually what we expect when reddening is not negligible , introducing significant errors in the photometric @xmath2 [ which are based on unreddened values for @xmath23 ] . addressing these and other issues exceeds the scope of this exploratory study .",
    "the corrected @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and [ fe / h ] values can be directly compared to those given in the _ elodie _ library .",

    "we find that 36 stars from the last set are included in the determination of stellar parameters by allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 ) based on the comparison of observed colors and parallaxes with evolutionary models .",
    "the mean and median uncertainties for the reference gravities are both 0.08 dex . for these stars ,",

    "the classification system is based on synthetic spectra calculated with classical flux - constant model atmospheres , and it is anchored to the photometric calibrations of effective temperature derived by alonso and collaborators ( alonso et al .",

    "the system is able to classify a stellar spectrum in only 3 seconds on a modern workstation .",
    "work is in progress to improve the accuracy of the synthetic spectra by using a more realistic line absorption profile for h@xmath0 .",
    "we also plan on varying the parameters that affect the performance of the employed ga , and testing different optimization algorithms . an important question to answer",
    "is how the performance of our system improves or degrades with spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "different spectral ranges should be explored .",
    "spectral bands with lines of metals whose abundances do not scale well with iron should be avoided , unless more parameters are included in the search , which is certainly feasible .",
    "different classification algorithms for stellar spectra have been tested in the literature .",
    "in particular , artificial neural networks hold the promise for the highest speeds , which may be critical for problems involving a large number of free parameters ( see , e.g. bailer - jones 2001 ; snider et al 2001 ) .",
    "when the number of parameters is limited , like in the spectroscopic classification considered here , gas have the advantage of not requiring training .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to explore different strategies , such as the selection of the spectral range or the resolving power , very quickly , while keeping the search global .",
    "our final goal is to provide a web interface and make this or a similar system publicly available .",
    "future work will target hotter spectral types , using calculations based upon non - lte model atmospheres .",
    "extension to the bottom of the main - sequence and beyond could follow , although theoretical modelling of cool atmospheres has not yet reached the same level of maturity as for warmer stars .",
