    "in the last three decades transport through molecular junctions @xcite has attracted much attention because of fundamental aspects of the processes involved , as well as of potential practical prospects . in particular , studies in this direction",
    "have intensified since the discovery of new forms of carbon allotropes , starting with the fullerenes @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite ( cnts ) in the 1980s and 1990s respectively , and the isolation of graphene @xcite in 2004 .",
    "the above carbon allotropes differ in shape ( curvature ) , topology , and dimensionality , with the fullerenes being zero - dimensional ( 0d ) with spherical or prolate shape , the cnts being one - dimensional ( 1d ) cylinders , and graphene being a two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane ( or 1d planar ribbons @xcite ) . in the fullerenes",
    "the carbon - atom network is made of ( non - adjacent ) hexagons and pentagons , whereas the cnts and graphene are entirely hexagonal lattices ( curved in cnts ) described in terms of a unit cell with a two - atom basis with the two carbon atoms occupying two sublattices ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , also mapped into the up and down pseudospin states @xcite ) . in the absence of defects , in - plane ( @xmath2 )",
    "bonding occurs through @xmath3 hybrid orbitals and out - of - plane bonding ( @xmath4 ) involves the @xmath5 orbital ; in the following only the physics of @xmath4-states is considered .",
    "the hexagonal network topology of graphene gives rise to relativistic behavior of the low - energy excitations which is captured by the ultra - relativistic massless dirac - weyl ( dw ) equation , with the fermi velocity of graphene ( @xmath6 ) replacing the velocity of light .",
    "@xcite among the many manifestations of the relativistic behavior in graphene is the klein paradox , that is `` ... unimpeded penetration of relativistic particles through high and wide potential barriers  is one of the most exotic and counterintuitive consequences of quantum electrodynamics.''@xcite the surprising relativistic behavior in graphene has indeed been recognized in the 2010 nobel award in physics to a. geim and k. novosolev .",
    "another carbon - based system that was the subject of an earlier ( 2000 ) chemistry nobel award ( to a.j .",
    "heeger , a.g .",
    "macdiarmid , and h. shirakawa ) is conductive polymers , with polyacetelyne ( pac ) being a representative example .",
    "@xcite pac is a 1d chain of carbon atoms forming a conjugated polymer with @xmath7 hybridization that leads to one unpaired electron per carbon atom ( half - filled @xmath4-band ) as in graphene . linearizing the spectrum of this 1d equally - spaced carbon chain at the fermi level ( that is at the dirac points , i.e. , the zero - energy points of the energy vs momentum dispersion relation ) results in a 1d massless dirac - equation description of the low energy excitations of the system",
    "@xcite    however , the equally - spaced 1d system is unstable and consequently it distorts ( structurally ) spontaneously ( peierls distortion @xcite ) yielding a modulation ( alternation ) of the spacing between successive sites that results in dimerization of successive atoms along the chain and the opening of a gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "this dimerization can occur in two energetically degenerate , but spatially distinct , patterns , termed as equivalent domain structures . either of these domains is a realization of the 1d dirac equation with a constant mass term , @xmath8 .",
    "disruption of the dimerization pattern ( e.g. , by transforming from one domain to another along the chain ) creates a domain wall which can be described in the 1d dirac formulation through the use of a position - dependent mass term of alternating sign ( with the spatial mass - profile connecting @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) .",
    "the solution of this generalized 1d dirac equation is a soliton characterized by having zero energy and by being localized at the domain wall . in this paper , the dirac equation with position - dependent mass will be used in investigations of the electronic structure , transport , and magnetic - field - induced phenomena ( aharonov - bohm ) in graphene nanostructures such as nanoribbon junctions and rings .",
    "@xcite    from the above we conclude that in the two extreme size - domains , that is a 2d infinite graphene sheet and a 1d carbon chain ( pac ) , the systems exhibit behavior that is relativistic in nature . in an attempt to bridge between these two size - domains ,",
    "we briefly discuss in the following systems of successively larger width , starting from the polyacene ( a quasi-1d chain of fused benzene rings ) which may be regarded as the narrowest graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) with zigzag edge terminations .",
    "polyacene was investigated @xcite first in 1983 .",
    "it was found that , as in graphene and pac ( without distortion ) , the valence and conduction bands of undistorted polyacene touch at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "however , unlike 2d graphene and pac , the dispersion relation about the touching point is quadratic , conferring a non - relativistic ( schrdinger equation ) character .",
    "we show in this paper that this surprising finding persists for sufficiently narrow gnrs with zigzag termination ( zgnrs ) . however , narrow armchair - terminated gnrs ( agnrs ) are found here to maintain relativistic behavior , with metallic ones being massless and semiconducting ones being massive ( both classes obeying the einstein energy relation ) .",
    "it this paper , we discuss mainly manifestations of relativistic and/or nonrelativistic quantum behavior explored through theoretical considerations of transport measurements in segmented graphene nanoribbons of variable width , and spectral and topological effects in graphene nanorings in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "transport through narrow graphene channels @xmath11 particularly bottom - up fabricated and atomically - precise graphene nanoribbons @xcite @xmath11 is expected to offer ingress to unique behavior of dirac electrons in graphene nanostructures . in particular ,",
    "the wave nature of elementary particles ( e.g. , electrons and photons ) is commonly manifested and demonstrated in transport processes .",
    "because of an exceptionally high electron mobility and a long mean - free path , it has been anticipated that graphene @xcite devices hold the promise for the realization , measurement , and possible utilization of fundamental aspects of coherent and ballistic transport behavior , which to date have been observed , with varying degrees of success , mainly at semiconductor interfaces @xcite , quantum point contacts @xcite , metallic wires @xcite , and carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of coherent ballistic transport are interference phenomena , reflecting the wave nature of the transporting physical object , and associated most often with optical ( electromagnetic waves , photons ) systems or with analogies to such systems ( that is , the behavior of massless particles , as in graphene sheets ) . measurements of interference patterns are commonly made with the use of interferometers , most familiar among them the multi - pass optical fabry - prot ( ofp ) interferometer @xcite .",
    "the advent of 2d forms of carbon allotropes has motivated the study of optical - like interference phenomena associated with relativistic massless electrons , as in the case of metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite and graphene 2d @xmath12-@xmath13 junctions @xcite .",
    "( we note that the hallmark of the ofp is that the energy separation between successive maxima of the interference pattern varies as the inverse of the cavity length @xmath14 . )    for gnrs with segments of different widths , our investigations reveal diverse fabry - prot transport modes beyond the ofp case , with conductance quantization steps ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ) found only for uniform gnrs .",
    "in particular , three distinct categories of fabry - prot interference patterns are identified :    1 .   _",
    "fp - a : _ an _ optical _ fp pattern corresponding to _ massless _ graphene electrons exhibiting _ equal spacing _ between neighboring peaks .",
    "this pattern is associated with metallic armchair nanoribbon central segments .",
    "this category is subdivided further to _ fp - a1 _ and _ fp - a2 _ depending on whether a valence - to - conduction gap is absent ( _ fp - a1 _ , associated with metallic armchair leads ) , or present ( _ fp - a2 _ , corresponding to semiconducting armchair leads ) .",
    "2 .   _ fp - b : _",
    "a _ massive relativistic _ fp pattern exhibiting a shift in the conduction onset due to the valence - to - conduction gap and _ unequal peak spacings_. this pattern is associated with semiconducting armchair nanoribbon central segments , irrespective of whether the leads are metallic armchair , semiconducting armchair , or zigzag .",
    "_ fp - c : _ a _ massive non - relativistic _ fp pattern with @xmath17 _ peak spacings _ , but with a vanishing valence - to - conduction gap , @xmath14 being the length of the central segment .",
    "this pattern is the one expected for usual semiconductors described by the ( nonrelativistic ) schrdinger equation , and it is associated with zigzag nanoribbon central segments , irrespective of whether zigzag or metallic armchair leads are used",
    ".    we report in this paper on the unique apects of transport through segmented gnrs obtained from tight - binding non - equilibrium green s function @xcite ( tb - negf ) calculations in conjunction with an analysis based on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) relativistic dirac continuum model .",
    "this continuum model goes beyond the physics of the massless dirac - weyl ( dw ) electron , familiar from two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb carbon sheets @xcite , and it is referred to by us as the dirac - fabry - prot ( dfp ) theory ( see below for the choice of name ) . in particular , it is shown that the valence - to - conduction energy gap in armchair gnr ( agnr ) segments , as well as the barriers at the interfaces between nanoribbon segments , can be incorporated in an effective position - dependent mass term in the dirac hamiltonian ; the transport solutions associated with this hamiltonian exhibit conductance patterns comparable to those obtained from the microscopic negf calculations . for zigzag graphene nanoribbon ( zgnr ) segments , the valence - to - conduction energy gap vanishes , and the mass term is consonant with excitations corresponding to massive nonrelativistic schrdinger - type carriers .",
    "the faithful reproduction of these unique tb - negf conductance patterns by the dfp theory , including mixed armchair - zigzag configurations ( where the carriers transit from a relativistic to a nonrelativistic regime ) , provides a unifying framework for analysis of coherent transport phenomena and for interpretation of experiments targeting fundamental understanding of transport in gnrs and the future development of graphene nanoelectronics .    to demonstrate the aforementioned soliton formation due to structural topological effects ( discussed by us above in the context of polyacetylene ) , we explore with numerical tight - binding calculations and a dirac - kronig - penney ( dkp ) approach , soliton formation and charge fractionization in graphene rhombic rings ; this dkp approach is based on a generalized dirac equation with alternating - sign position - dependent masses .    before leaving the introduction",
    ", we mention that , due to their importance as fundamental phenomena , aharonov - bohm - type effects in graphene - nanoribbons systems have attracted ( in addition to refs .   ) considerable theoretical attention . @xcite these latter theoretical papers , however , based their analysis exclusively on tight - binding and/or dft calculations@xcite , or they used in addition a two - dimensional dirac equation with infinite - mass boundary conditions.@xcite transcending the level of current understanding which explores direct similaritiess with the aharonov - bohm physics in semiconductor and metallic mesoscopic rings , our work here analyzes the tb results in conjunction with a continuum 1d generalized dirac equation ( that incorporates a position - dependent mass term ) , and thus it enables investigations of until - now unexplored topological aspects and relativistic quantum - field analogies of the ab effect in graphene nanosystems .",
    "furthermore we note that oscillations in the conductance of graphene nanoribbons in the presence of magnetic barriers were found in a theoretical study @xcite ( using exclusively a tb - negf approach ) , as well as in an experimental investigation of high quality bilayer nanoribbons , @xcite and they were attributed to fabry - prot - type interference . in the absence of a continuum",
    "dirac analysis , the precise relation of such oscillatory patterns to our fabry - prot theory ( based on the incorporation of a position - dependent mass term in the dirac equation at zero magnetic field ) warrants further investigation .",
    "finally , gap engineering in graphene ribbons under strong external fields was studied in ref .  .",
    "we stress again that one of the main results in this paper is the appearance of `` forbidden '' solitonic states inside the energy gap in the context of the low - magnetic - field aharonov - bohm spectra of graphene nanorings ; see the part titled `` aharonov - bohm spectra of rhombic graphene rings '' in the results section .",
