    "one of the most important problems today in cosmology is the nature of dark matter and dark energy that must dominate the matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark matter is suggested by the anomalies in the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "dark energy seems to be an inevitable consequence of the present acceleration of the universe as indicated by the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data , which asks for a fluid of negative pressure which does not agglomerate at small scales @xcite . while in general the nature of dark matter",
    "can be connected with relics of fundamental theories , like axions @xcite , there are two main candidates to represent dark energy : cosmological constant @xcite and quintessence which is a self interacting scalar field @xcite@xcite .",
    "both models suffers of many drawbacks , mainly linked with fine tuning of parameters , as in the quintessence model @xcite , or disagreement with the theoretically predicted values , like in the cosmological constant case @xcite .",
    "the traditional chaplygin gas model ( cgm ) and the  generalized chaplygin gas model ( gcgm ) have been widely considered as alternatives to the cosmological constant and to quintessence as the dark energy that drives the present acceleration of the universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "the appealing of the gcgm comes from , among other reasons , the fact that it can unify the description of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is characterized by the equation of state @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants that in general are considered as positive numbers .",
    "the conservation equation leads to the relation @xmath17 some of the main interesting features of eq .",
    "( [ densidade ] ) are the following . initially , the gcgm behaves as a dust fluid , with @xmath18 , while at late times the gcgm behaves as a cosmological constant term , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the gcgm interpolates a matter dominated phase ( where the formation of structure can happen ) and a de sitter phase . at the same time",
    ", the sound velocity of the gcgm is positive which assures that , in spite of exhibiting a negative pressure , it is stable against perturbations of the background configuration @xcite .    a lot of effort has been done in order to constrain the free parameters of the gcgm .",
    "type ia supernovae data @xcite@xcite , the spectra of anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , the mass power spectrum @xcite , gravitational lenses @xcite , x - ray data @xcite and age estimates of high-@xmath20 objects @xcite have extensively been used in this sense .",
    "this is essential for many obvious reasons .",
    "one of them is that if the parameter @xmath16 is close to zero , the gcgm reduces essentially to the cosmological constant model .",
    "if observations indicate that this is the preferred value , the appealing for the cosmological constant as dark energy is reinforced . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we have analysed the case of the traditional chaplygin gas model , where @xmath21 , using the sne ia data .",
    "one important aspect of this analysis is the use of the bayesian statistics , for one side , and also the fact that all free parameters ( hubble constant , the curvature term , the value of the sound velocity and the proportion of ordinary matter and chaplygin gas ) of the model were taken into account in the treatment of the problem .",
    "this contrasts with most of the analyses previously found in the literature in the sense that they employ a more simplified statistical analysis or some input parameters were fixed a priori @xcite@xcite . in that work @xcite , it was concluded that the unification scenario ( i.e. , without pressureless matter ) , and a sound velocity near ( but not equal ) to the velocity of light were preferred .",
    "moreover , a closed universe was clearly favoured .",
    "the aim of the present work is to apply the same analysis , using the bayesian statistics and taking into account all free parameters , to the gcgm . in order to keep contact with the previous work",
    ", we will use the same supernovae sample .",
    "this sample is much smaller than those available today ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "but , the quality of the data is extremely good , which leads to a smaller value of @xmath22 ( the quantity that measures the quality of the fitting ) : with this restricted sample the best - fitting gives @xmath22 around @xmath23 , while for the complete `` gold '' sample @xcite , the value mounts to unity . in the gcgm",
    "there are five free parameters instead of the four free parameters of the traditional chaplygin gas model ( @xmath21 ) : the hubble constant @xmath24 , the parameter @xmath0 related to the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas , the curvature density parameter @xmath25 , the ordinary matter parameter @xmath26 ( or alternatively , the chaplygin gas parameter @xmath27 ) and the equation of state parameter @xmath16 .",
    "one important point in performing this generalized analysis is the range of validity of the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "usually , it has been assumed that @xmath28 .",
    "the reason is twofold : @xmath16 greater than one could lead , even if in the future , to a sound velocity greater than the velocity of the light ; @xmath16 negative should lead to an imaginary sound velocity , that is , instability .",
    "however , an analysis of the supernovae data may taken into account values of @xmath16 greater than one or negative .",
    "in particular , in reference @xcite , using a different statistical approach with respect to the method employed here , a value of @xmath29 near @xmath30 was favoured .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath16 outside that limited range can be considered .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the gcgm with the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) may be a phenomenological manifestation of a theory expressed in terms , for example , of scalar field with a potential , or even of tachyon condensate model @xcite . in this case",
    ", the notion of sound velocity can not be identified with the ordinary expression used in the perfect fluid approach , and no violation of causality or instability may occur if @xmath16 is greater than one or negative .",
    "hence , in our analysis the parameter @xmath16 will vary from negative to highly positive values .",
    "the prediction for each parameter ( @xmath16 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath0 ) is taken marginalizing , i.e. , integrating over the other parameters .",
    "we stress that such marginalization procedure gives predictions that can be quite different from a two dimensional analysis , for example , where one searches for the simultaneous preferred values for any two parameters .",
    "this marginalization is in fact essential in order to have the correct prediction for a given free parameter .",
    "we will consider the following cases : all five parameters free ; spatial curvature zero ( four free parameters ) ; pressureless matter given only by the barionic component ( four free parameters ) ; pressureless matter absent ( four free parameters ) ; spatial curvature zero and no pressureless matter component ( three free parameters ) ; spatial curvature zero and pressureless matter component given by the barionic component ( three free parameteres ) .",
    "for the more general case with five free parameters the predictions we obtain are the following : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath5 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "moreover the predicted age of the universe and the value of de deceleration parameter today are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the results are consistent with , for example , the age of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "two crucial parameters are @xmath16 and @xmath38 , since if @xmath39 and/or @xmath40 are favoured , the gcgm becomes equivalent to the cosmological constant model ( @xmath41cdm ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath0 is in fact peaked at unity .",
    "but for reasons discussed later , this does not imply that this is the most favoured value ; indeed it is just expected to be near unity . on the other hand , the parameter @xmath16 is peaked in a negative value , but the spread is very large . in particular , the traditional chaplygin gas with @xmath42 can not be excluded or even disfavoured : in most of the cases this value of @xmath16 is favoured with a probability around @xmath43 .",
    "hence , our analysis does not exclude the traditional chaplygin gas model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "the basic equations and quantities are exhibited .",
    "section @xmath44 explains the type ia supernovae fitting .",
    "in section @xmath45 , we display the results of the bayesian analysis of type ia supernovae data with the gcgm .",
    "we present our conclusions in section @xmath46 .",
    "regardless the possibility of unification of dark matter and dark energy using the gcgm , we will consider a model for the universe today with two fluids : pressureless matter and the gcg .",
    "in doing so , our aim is to verify whether the unified model is the case favoured by observations .",
    "moreover , even if in the gcgm there is no need of a dark matter component , there is baryonic matter in the universe which is represented also by a pressureless matter .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the universe is driven by the friedmann s equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 stand for the pressureless matter and generalized chaplygin gas component .",
    "dot means derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath50 . as usual",
    ", @xmath51 indicates a flat , closed and open spatial section . in the conservation equation for the generalized chaplygin gas component",
    "( [ be5 ] ) , the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) has been introduced .",
    "the equations expressing the conservation law for each fluid ( [ be4])-([be5 ] ) lead to @xmath52 henceforth , we will parametrize the scale factor such that its value today is equal to unity , @xmath53 . hence",

    "the luminosity distance is given by the expression @xmath60 @xmath61 being the co - moving coordinate of the source . using the expression for the propagation of light @xmath62 and the friedmann s equation ( [ be3 ] ) , we can reexpress the luminosity distance as @xmath63\\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65^{1/(1+\\alpha ) } -\\omega _ { k0}(z^{\\prime } + 1)^{2}\\}^{1/2}}\\quad , \\ ] ] with the definitions @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",

    "the value of the decelerated parameter today , @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73    the value @xmath74  of the scale factor that shows the beginning of the recent accelerating phase of the universe is given by the roots of the equation @xmath75 and is related to the redshift value @xmath76 such that @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "we proceed by fitting the sne ia data using the gcg model described above .",
    "essentially , we compute the quantity distance moduli , @xmath79 and compare the same distance moduli as obtained from observations .",

    "@xcite , @xmath81 in this expression , @xmath82 is the measured value , @xmath83 is the value calculated through the model described above , @xmath84 is the measurement error , @xmath85 is the dispersion in the distance modulus due to the dispersion in galaxy redshift due to peculiar velocities .",

    "@xcite ) , but instead we can concentrate our efforts on the gcgm . although nowadays there are approximately @xmath89 sne ia available , the choice of these @xmath88 are confirmed to be of excellent quality by analysing the low values of @xmath90 ( the estimated errors for degree of freedom , i.e. , @xmath80 divided by @xmath88 , the number of sne ia ) , shown in table [ tablebestfitgcg ] .",

    "the estimations for the cgm and @xmath339cdm cases ( tables @xmath45 and @xmath46 , ref .",

    "in this paper we investigated some constraints on the generalized chaplygin gas model ( gcgm ) using type ia supernovae data and bayesian statistics .",
    "the model is built with the chaplygin gas and a pressureless fluid as the matter content of the universe , whose density parameters today are @xmath27 and @xmath26 respectively , such that the curvature term is @xmath340 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 related to the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas , the hubble parameter @xmath24 and the @xmath29 parameter are also independent free variables .",
    "we allowed the parameter @xmath16 to vary between negative and large positive values . in principle , this could lead to instability problems at perturbative level ( @xmath29 negative ) , or superluminal sound velocity ( @xmath16 greater than one ) , but both potential problems can be resolved using a fundamental description for the gcg .",
    "when the five independent parameters are free , the bayesian estimation yields @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 , @xmath344 , @xmath302 , @xmath345 , @xmath36 , @xmath346 and @xmath333 where @xmath311 is the age of the universe , @xmath319 is the value of the deceleration parameter today and @xmath74 is the value of the scale factor that marks the start of the recent accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "we have also estimated the cosmological parameters fixing the pressureless matter ( through the constraints of nucleosynthesis ) or the curvature ( imposing the flat condition ) , or even both .",
    "the estimations of the remaining free parameters do not change dramatically in each case , with some exceptions .",
    "for example , the prediction for the curvature parameter depends on whenever the pressureless matter is fixed or not : a spatially flat universe is favoured only if @xmath26 is fixed at low values .",
    "in particular , we verify that the @xmath16 parameter is strongly related to the @xmath0 parameter . in this manner ,",
    "the best value of @xmath16 have the peak values and the credible regions changed in function of the marginalization process used .",
    "the @xmath16 estimations are very spread and differ a lot if one or two - dimensional parameter space is used .",
    "many authors @xcite@xcite , prefer to estimate @xmath16 and @xmath96 simultaneously using two - dimensional credible regions and they do not marginalize the pdf to obtain the more statistically robust one - dimensional pdfs for @xmath16 and @xmath0 , so any comparison should be taken carefully as the credible region estimations on two - dimensional parameter space are usually different from the one - dimensional estimations .    here",
    "we take the marginalization approach to obtain one - dimensional pdfs , and one important point arises in this analysis : despite the dependency on the @xmath0 parameter , the value @xmath21 , that represents the ordinary cgm , is not ruled out since this particular case is preferred at @xmath347 to @xmath348 , depending on the spatial section and matter content .",
    "we calculated the value of the scale factor when the dark energy starts to prevail , @xmath349 , for the case of five free parameters .",
    "in general , the value for @xmath74 ranges between @xmath350 and @xmath351 , where @xmath99 is the value of the scale factor today .",
    "this results are coherent with the suposition that the recent acceleration of the universe could be started with the redshift parameter @xmath20 between @xmath288 and @xmath2 obtained by the type ia supernovae data .    in the case of the ordinary matter",
    "parameter @xmath26 our analyses show that the preferred values are small , around zero .",
    "this situation is the same of the case of the ordinary chaplygin gas .",
    "the result reinforces the idea of the quartessence model @xcite , that unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single fluid , the chaplygin gas .",
    "the predicted age of the universe is well above the age of globular clusters . at same time , the deceleration parameter is consistent with the estimations from the wmap data .",
    "further developments of the present work include the use of a large sample of type ia supernovae .",
    "however , the sample of @xmath88 sne ia used here has an excellent quality with respect to the low values of @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , the dispersion of the parameter estimations obtained here has the same order of estimations using larger samples . in some cases",
    "our estimation are even less spread , as our preliminary investigation on larger sne ia indicates .",
    "we also plan to apply the bayesian analysis to the gcgm using large scale structures data ( 2dfrgs ) and to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background . in this way",
