    "the final merger of two black holes in a binary system releases more power than the combined light from all the stars in the visible universe .",
    "this vast energy comes in the form of gravitational waves , which travel across the universe at the speed of light , bearing the waveform signature of the merger . today , ground - based gravitational - wave detectors stand poised to detect the mergers of stellar black - hole binaries , the corpses of massive stars . in addition",
    ", planning is underway for a space - based detector that will observe the mergers of massive black holes , awesome behemoths at the centers of galaxies , with masses of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the sun . since template matching forms the basis of most gravitational - wave data analysis , knowledge of the merger waveforms is crucial .",
    "calculating these waveforms requires solving the full einstein equations of general relativity on a computer in three spatial dimensions plus time .",
    "as you might imagine , this is a formidable task .",
    "in fact , numerical relativists have attempted to solve this problem for many years , only to encounter a host of puzzling instabilities causing the computer codes to crash before they could compute any sizable portion of a binary orbit .",
    "remarkably , in the past few years a series of dramatic breakthroughs has occurred in numerical relativity ( nr ) , yielding robust and accurate simulations of black - hole mergers for the first time .    in this article",

    "we will frequently also refer to the _ symmetric mass ratio _",
    "@xmath6 for simplicity , we choose to set @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; with this , we can scale the dynamics and waveforms for black - hole binaries with the total system mass @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we can express both length and time scales in terms of the mass , giving @xmath10 .",

    "we next turn to a historical overview in sec .",

    "before we begin , we mention several other resources that may interest our readers .",
    "the review articles by @xcite and @xcite provide interesting surveys of numerical relativity several years before the breakthroughs in black - hole merger simulations . the article by @xcite is an early review of the recent successes , covering some of the same topics that we discuss here .",
    "@xcite reviewed the status of black - hole simulations producing long waveforms ( including at least ten cycles of the dominant gravitational - wave mode ) and their application to gravitational - wave data analysis .",
    "finally , the text books by @xcite and @xcite provide many more details on the mathematical and computational aspects of numerical relativity than we can include here , and serve as useful supplements to our discussions .",
    "black holes and gravitational waves are surely among the most exotic and amazing predictions in all of physics .",
    "these two offspring of einstein s general relativity are brought together in black - hole binaries , expected to be among the strongest emitters of gravitational radiation .",
    "we begin by presenting some basic properties of black holes and gravitational waves . for fuller discussions and more details , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a black hole forms when matter collapses to infinite density , producing a singularity of infinite curvature in the fabric of spacetime . each black hole is surrounded by an event horizon , at which the escape velocity is the speed of light .",
    "the event horizon is a global property of the spacetime , since it is defined by the paths of  outgoing \" photons that are the boundary between photon trajectories that must fall inward , and those that can escape to infinity .",
    "the photons defining the event horizon hover at finite radius at the surface of the black hole .",
    "since , in principle , mass ( energy ) can fall into the event horizon at late times  which will move the location at which photon paths can hover  we must know the entire future development of the system to locate the event horizon .    when black holes merge , a single event horizon forms whose area is at least as large as the sum of the individual horizons .",
    "since numerical relativists want to know when this occurs during the course of a calculation , they rely on a related concept known as an _ apparent horizon _ , whose location depends only on the properties of the spacetime at any given time @xcite . for quiescent black holes ,",
    "the apparent and event horizons coincide ; for more general holes , the apparent horizon is always inside the event horizon ( with restrictions on the behavior of the matter involved ) .",
    "so , in terms of causality in a numerically - generated spacetime , any physical phenomenon found inside an apparent horizon should not leak out and affect the spacetime outside .",
    "the simplest black hole is nonrotating and is described by the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution to the einstein equations of general relativity in vacuum ( i.e. , with no `` matter '' sources in the spacetime ) .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole is fully specified by one quantity , its mass @xmath9 .",
    "the horizon is located at coordinate @xmath11 ( in schwarzschild coordinates ) ; its area is @xmath12 .",
    "more general black holes can have both charge and spin .",
    "since a charged black hole in astrophysics will generally be neutralized rapidly by any surrounding plasma , we can consider only rotating , uncharged black holes .",
    "stationary ( i.e. , time independent ) black holes are described by the axisymmetric kerr solution .",
    "a kerr black hole is fully specified by two quantities , its mass @xmath9 and its angular momentum per unit mass @xmath13 .",
    "the event horizon is located at the boyer - lindquist @xcite radius @xmath14 , where @xmath15 the area of the event horizon is @xmath16 .",
    "equation   requires @xmath17 ; when @xmath18 the black hole is said to be maximally rotating or `` extremal '' .",
    "notice that @xmath19 when @xmath20 , and that @xmath14 decreases as @xmath13 increases , thus bringing the location of the horizon deeper into the potential well as the black - hole spin increases .",
    "photons and test particles in the vicinity of a single black hole can experience either stable or unstable orbits . for a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath9 , the _ innermost stable circular orbit _",
    "( isco ) occurs at @xmath21 for massive test particles . in the case of a kerr black hole ,",
    "the isco is closer in for co - rotating test particles , and farther out for counter - rotating particles .",
    "while the concept of an isco is strictly defined only for massive test particles , it has proven useful for studies of the spacetime around two black holes spiralling together on quasicircular orbits .",
    "imagine that you put the two black holes on an _ instantaneously _ circular orbit around each other ; at that moment they have neither nonzero radial velocity nor nonzero radial acceleration . at",
    "any given separation , the black holes have some angular momentum .",
    "the isco is the separation where that angular momentum is a minimum , in analogy to the test particle definition .",
    "black holes at closer separations would be expected to fall inward , toward the center , even without radiating angular momentum via gravitational radiation .",
    "gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime itself .",
    "they carry energy and momentum and travel at the speed of light , bearing the message of disturbances in the gravitational field .    as with electromagnetic waves",
    ", gravitational waves can be decomposed into multipolar contributions that reflect the nature of the source that generates them .",
    "recall that electromagnetic radiation has no monopole contribution due to the conservation of total charge . by analogy , conservation of total mass - energy guarantees that there can be no monopole gravitational radiation .",
    "since dipolar variations of charge and currents are possible , electromagnetic waves can have a dipole character .",
    "however , conservation of linear and angular momenta removes any possibility of dipolar gravitational waves , so the leading - order contribution to gravitational radiation is quadrupolar .",
    "gravitational waves are thus generated by systems with time - varying mass quadrupole moments @xcite . in the wave zone",
    ", a gravitational wave is described as a perturbation @xmath22 to a smooth underlying spacetime .",
    "the wave amplitude is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the quadrupole moment of the source , @xmath25 is the distance from the source , and @xmath26 is the mass in the source that is undergoing quadrupolar changes .",
    "this shows that the strongest gravitational waves will be produced by large masses moving at high velocities , such as binaries of compact stars and black holes .",
    "the wave on the left is purely in the @xmath27 polarization state , and the one on the right is purely in the @xmath28 polarization state .",
    "the gravitational waves produce tidal forces in planes transverse to the propagation direction . from @xcite .",
    "reprinted with permission from aaas.,width=336 ]    a gravitational wave is purely transverse , acting tidally in directions perpendicular to its propagation direction .",
    "when a gravitational wave impinges on a detector of length scale @xmath29 , it produces a length change in that detector @xmath30 . by substituting in typical values for compact objects in the universe into eq .  , one can see that astrophysical sources typically yield wave amplitudes of @xmath31 at the earth .",
    "consequently , precision measurements are needed to make detections .",
    "gravitational waves have two polarization components , known as @xmath32 and @xmath33 for a linearly polarized wave . figure  [ fig : forcelines ] shows the corresponding lines of force for sinusoidal gravitational waves propagating along the @xmath34 axis . in the purely @xmath27 polarization on the left , the wave stretches along one axis and squeezes along the other , alternating sinusoidally as the wave passes .",
    "the @xmath28 polarization wave on the right acts similarly , stretching and squeezing along axes rotated by @xmath35 . in general , a gravitational wave is a superposition of these two states , conveniently written as a complex waveform strain @xmath22 , where @xmath36      astronomers have found evidence for black holes throughout the universe on a remarkable range of scales .",
    "the smallest of these , stellar black holes , have masses in the range @xmath37 and form as the end - products of massive star evolution .",
    "there is good observational evidence for the existence of stellar black holes , based on dynamical measurements of the masses of compact objects in transient systems that undergo x - ray outbursts .",
    "since neutron stars can not have masses @xmath38 , compact objects more massive than this must be black holes @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) have masses in the range @xmath39 .",
    "imbhs may form as the result of multiple mergers of smaller objects in the centers of dense stellar clusters in the present universe @xcite , assuming mass loss from stellar winds is not significant @xcite .",
    "they may also arise from the evolution of very massive stars early in the history of the universe , forming black - hole `` seeds '' in the centers of massive halos ( the precursors of the galaxies we see today ) early in the history of the universe , to redshifts @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "currently the best observational evidence for imbhs comes from models of ultraluminous x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "finally , massive black holes ( mbhs ) have masses in the range @xmath41 and are found at the centers of galaxies , including our own milky way galaxy . the observational case for the existence of mbhs",
    "is quite strong , based on dynamical models of stars and gas believed to be moving in the potential well of the central mbh @xcite .",
    "black - hole binaries are binary systems in which each component is a black hole .",
    "as mentioned above , we focus here on comparable - mass binaries , which are expected to produce the strongest gravitational - wave signals .",
    "stellar black - hole binaries may form as the result of binaries composed of two massive stars ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "stellar black - hole binaries may also arise from dynamical processes in which a black hole is captured into an orbit around another black hole in dense stellar environments @xcite .",
    "imbh binaries can also form through dynamical processes in stellar clusters @xcite and from mergers of massive halos at high redshifts . since both stellar and imbh binaries are `` dark ''  that is , they are generally not surrounded by gas which might produce electromagnetic radiation  we have few observational constraints on these types of black - hole binaries .",
    "this situation will change dramatically , however , with the detection of gravitational radiation from these systems @xcite , as gravitational waves bring direct information about the dynamical behavior of the orbiting masses and do not rely on electromagnetic emissions from nearby matter .    since essentially all galaxies are believed to contain an mbh at the center and to undergo a merger with another galaxy at least once during the history of the universe",
    ", mbh binaries can arise when their host galaxies merge @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , due to the vast cosmic distances involved , and the small angular separations on the sky expected for mbh binaries , only a few candidates are currently known through electromagnetic observations @xcite . when they form , mbh binaries typically have relatively wide separations , and the gravitational radiation they emit is very weak and insufficient to cause the binary to coalesce within the age of the universe",
    ". however , various processes such as gaseous dissipation and @xmath42-body interactions with stars can remove orbital energy from the binary and cause the black holes to spiral together @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "eventually , the black holes reach separations at which gravitational radiation reaction becomes the dominant energy - loss mechanism , leading to the final coalescence of the black holes and the emission of strong gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "mergers of comparable - mass black - hole binaries are expected to be among the strongest sources of gravitational waves .",
    "this final death spiral of a black - hole binary encompasses three stages : inspiral , merger , and ringdown @xcite .",
    "in the early stages of the inspiral , the orbits of most astrophysical black - hole binaries will circularize due to the emission of gravitational radiation @xcite . during the inspiral ,",
    "the orbital time scale is much shorter than the time scale on which the orbital parameters change ; consequently , the black holes spiral together on quasicircular orbits . since the black holes have wide separations , they can be treated as point particles .",
    "the inspiral dynamics and waveforms can be calculated using post - newtonian ( pn ) equations , which result from a systematic expansion of the full einstein equations in powers of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the binary separation @xcite .",
    "the inspiral phase produces gravitational waves in the characteristic form of a _ chirp _ , which is a sinusoid with both frequency and amplitude increasing with time .",
    "as the black holes spiral inward , they eventually reach the strong - field , dynamical regime of general relativity . in this merger stage ,",
    "the orbital evolution is no longer quasi - adiabatic ; rather , the black holes plunge together and coalesce into a single , highly distorted remnant black hole , surrounded by a common horizon . since the point - particle and pn approximations break down , numerical relativity simulations of the einstein equations in three dimensions are needed to calculate the merger . due to the difficulty of these simulations , the resulting gravitational waveforms were completely unknown until recently .",
    "finally , the highly distorted remnant black hole settles down into a quiescent rotating kerr black hole by shedding its nonaxisymmetric modes through gravitational - wave emission .",
    "we call this process the `` ringdown , '' in analogy to how a bell that has been struck sheds its distortions as sound waves",
    ". various analytic techniques of black - hole perturbation theory @xcite form the basis of ringdown calculations , producing gravitational waveforms in the shape of exponentially damped sinusoids @xcite .",
    "the characteristic gravitational - wave frequency of a quasicircular black - hole binary , produced by the dominant ( highest - order ) quadrupole component , is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the orbital frequency .",
    "astrophysical black - hole binaries produce gravitational waves that span three frequency regimes , depending on the black - hole masses @xcite .",
    "stellar black - hole binaries and the lower mass end of the imbh binaries radiate in the high frequency band , @xmath47 , which is already being observed by ground - based laser interferometer detectors such as ligo @xcite , and will be observed by the advanced detectors by @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "low frequency gravitational waves cover the band @xmath49 and will be observed by the space - based laser interferometer lisa , currently under development @xcite .",
    "mbh binaries with masses @xmath50 will be very strong sources for lisa , with the lower mass systems visible out to redshifts @xmath40 @xcite ; the inspirals of imbh binaries will also be detectable @xcite . finally , the very low frequency band @xmath51 will be observed by pulsar timing arrays @xcite .",
    "this band is expected to dominated by gravitational waves from a very large population of unresolved mbh binaries @xcite with possibly a few discrete sources @xcite .",
    "the quest to calculate the gravitational - wave signals from the merger of two black holes spans more than four decades and encompasses key developments in theoretical and experimental general relativity , astrophysics , and computational science . in this section ,",
    "we begin by delineating these threads in general terms , and then turn to a more detailed account of select milestones along the path toward successful simulations of black - hole mergers .      at the end of the 18th century @xcite and",
    "@xcite first speculated , using newtonian gravity , that a star could become so compact that the escape velocity from its surface would exceed the speed of light . in the 20th century , scientists realized that such black holes could form as the final state of total gravitational collapse in general relativity @xcite ; john wheeler would later popularize the term `` black hole '' to describe such an object @xcite .",
    "beginning in the 1960s , many highly energetic astrophysical phenomena were discovered with physical properties pointing to extremely strong gravitational fields as underlying mechanisms ; among these are quasars and x - ray binaries such as cygnus x-1 @xcite , the first credible black - hole candidate . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : astro_grav : astro_bhs ] , today astrophysical black holes are believed to exist on a vast range of scales throughout the universe , and black - hole binaries are considered to be strong sources of gravitational waves .",
    "einstein s equations of general relativity form a coupled set of nonlinear partial differential equations , in which dynamic curved spacetime takes the role of newton s gravitational field and interacts nonlinearly with massive bodies .",
    "gravitational waves were first recognized as solutions to the linearized , weak - field einstein equations early in the past century . by mid - century , gravitational waves were recognized as real physical phenomena , carrying energy and being capable of producing a response when impinging on a detector .",
    "this development spawned a major branch of experimental general relativity , with concepts for the first gravitational - wave detectors appearing in the 1960s ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "the discovery of two neutron stars in a binary system by @xcite provided an astrophysical laboratory for the first _ indirect _ detection of gravitational radiation .",
    "decades of observation revealed the binary orbit to be shrinking by precisely the amount expected if the system were emitting gravitational waves according to general relativity @xcite ; hulse and taylor were awarded the nobel prize in 1993 .",
    "today , the prognosis for _ direct _ detection of gravitational waves is excellent , with the first events expected from the advanced ground - based interferometers around the middle of this coming decade .",
    "as you might expect , einstein s equations pose formidable obstacles to anyone who would dare to probe the physics within . throughout most of the 20th century",
    ", relativists uncovered a fairly small number of exact solutions by exploiting symmetries , and made progress toward more general problems using various perturbative expansions . by the 1960s , computers had become powerful enough to encourage attempts at solving einstein s equations numerically , to uncover physics beyond the realm of perturbation theory .",
    "the subsequent development of numerical relativity has been made possible in part by continued increases in computer power and advances in algorithms and computational methods .",
    "most numerical - relativity simulations start with the idea of decomposing four - dimensional spacetime into a stack of curved three - dimensional spacelike slices threaded by a congruence of timelike curves @xcite .",
    "arnowit , deser , and misner ( adm ) pioneered this `` 3 + 1 '' approach as the basis for a canonical formulation of the dynamics of general relativity @xcite . in this hamiltonian formulation",
    ", the three - metric @xmath52 on the spatial slices takes the role of the `` configuration variables . ''",
    "quantities based on the extrinsic curvature @xmath53 , which is roughly the time derivative of @xmath52 , play the role of `` conjugate momenta . ''",
    "variation of an action with respect to @xmath52 produces a set of six first - order evolution equations for the conjugate momenta ; varying the momenta gives six first - order evolution equations for @xmath52 .",
    "adm also introduced four lagrange multipliers as freely specifiable gauge or coordinate conditions , representing the four coordinate degrees of freedom in general relativity .",
    "variation of these lagrange multipliers yields four equations that must hold on each slice : a hamiltonian constraint , and three momentum constraints .",
    "originally intended as a tool for quantizing gravity , the adm formalism later became the basis for most work in numerical relativity . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] below , key elements in this approach are solving the cauchy problem , beginning with the initial data on a spacelike slice , and then evolving that data forward in time .",
    "the constraint equations form the basis for this initial value problem .",
    "appropriate choices for the gauge conditions are crucial ingredients for today s successful black - hole merger simulations .",
    "@xcite made the first known attempt to simulate the head - on collision of two equal - mass black holes on a computer in 1964 , using a two - dimensional axisymmetric approach .",
    "their simulation ran for 50 timesteps to a duration of @xmath54 ; at this point , they decided that the simulation was no longer accurate enough to warrant continued evolution , and stopped the code .",
    "smarr and eppley @xcite returned to this problem in the mid-1970s , again employing two - dimensional axisymmetry but now using the adm formalism , specialized coordinates , and improved coordinate conditions .",
    "although they encountered problems with instabilities and large numerical errors , they managed to evolve the collision and extract information about the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "smarr and eppley had used the most powerful computers of their day . going to the next step , orbiting black holes in three dimensions ,",
    "was deemed to be not feasible at the time , due to unresolved questions about the instabilities and insufficient computer power .",
    "the black - hole merger problem lay dormant for over a decade .    in the 1990s",
    ", attention returned to black - hole mergers as the ligo project began to move forward , and black - hole mergers were recognized as the strongest sources for this detector .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ratio for such ground - based detectors is fairly modest , having a template for the merger waveform is a key part of the data analysis strategy .",
    "numerical relativists revisited the problem of colliding two black holes head - on with modern techniques and more powerful computers @xcite . in the mid-1990s ,",
    "the national science foundation funded a computational grand challenge grant for a large multi - institution collaboration aimed at evolving black - hole mergers in three dimensions and calculating the resulting gravitational waveforms .",
    "around the same time , a large and very active numerical relativity group arose at the newly - formed albert - einstein institut ( aei ) in potsdam , germany . during the late 1990s and into the early 2000s , two developments on the experimental side further increased the desire for black - hole merger simulations : the ground - based gravitational - wave detectors started taking data , and interest grew in lisa and its potential for observing gravitational waves from massive black - hole binary mergers .",
    "while no one expected the task at hand  developing computer codes to solve the full einstein equations in three dimensions for the final few orbits and merger of two black holes  to be simple , numerical relativists found that the problem was far more difficult than anticipated . producing a waveform useful for gravitational - wave detection purposes typically would require running a simulation for a duration of several hundred @xmath9 .",
    "however , a variety of instabilities plagued the codes , causing them to crash well before any significant portion of an orbit could be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , during a period encompassing a little over a decade , much important work was accomplished that laid the foundations for later success .",
    "key milestones include these developments :    * initial data for binary black holes near the isco @xcite ; * new methods for representing black holes on computational grids such as punctures @xcite and excision @xcite ; * recognition of the importance of hyperbolicity in formulating the einstein equations for numerical solution @xcite ; * improved formulations of the einstein equations @xcite ; * fully three - dimensional evolution codes and their use in evolving distorted black holes @xcite , boosted black holes @xcite , head - on collisions @xcite , and grazing collisions @xcite ; * coordinate conditions that keep the slices from crashing into singularities and the spatial coordinates from falling into the black holes as the evolution proceeds @xcite ; * the cactus computational toolkit , which provided a framework for developing numerical - relativity codes and analysis tools used by many groups ; * modern adaptive mesh refinement finite - difference ( including carpet with cactus , bam @xcite , and paramesh @xcite ) , and multi - domain spectral @xcite infrastructures for numerical relativity .    throughout this period , the length of black - hole evolutions gradually increased .",
    "improvements in the formalisms allowed simulations of single black holes and , later , two black holes to increase in duration to @xmath55 .",
    "the addition of new slicing and shift conditions again increased the evolution times to @xmath56 .",
    "the lazarus project took a novel approach to combine these relatively short - duration binary simulations with perturbation techniques for the late - time behavior to produce a hybrid model for a black - hole merger @xcite . by late 2003 , @xcite carried out the first complete orbit of two equal - mass , nonspinning black holes .",
    "while this simulation lasted @xmath57 , the code crashed shortly after the orbit was completed and the gravitational waves were not extracted .",
    "overall , progress was slow , difficult , and incremental .",
    "however , the situation was about to change dramatically .      in early 2005 ,",
    "frans pretorius electrified the relativity community when he achieved the first evolution of an equal - mass black - hole binary through its final orbit , merger , and ringdown using techniques very different from those employed by the rest of the community @xcite . later in 2005",
    "the groups at the university of texas at brownsville ( utb ) and nasa s goddard space flight center independently and simultaneously discovered a new method , called `` moving punctures , '' that also produced successful black - hole mergers @xcite .",
    "their presentations were given back - to - back at a workshop on numerical relativity , to the amazement of each other and the assembled participants .    since the moving - puncture approach was based on underlying techniques used by several other groups , it was rapidly and readily adopted by most in the community , producing a growing avalanche of results .",
    "2006 was a year of many firsts : the first simulations of unequal - mass black holes and the accompanying recoil of the remnant hole @xcite , the first mergers of spinning black holes @xcite , the first long waveforms ( @xmath58 orbits ) @xcite , the first comparisons with pn results @xcite , and the first systematic parameter study in numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "the year 2007 opened with the discovery of `` superkicks ''  recoil velocities exceeding @xmath59 @xcite , and in 2008 a black - hole binary merger with mass ratio @xmath60 was accomplished @xcite , while @xcite carried out the first long - term evolution of generic spinning and precessing black - hole binaries .",
    "as this article was being written in 2009 the state of the art continues to advance , with the first simulations of black - hole mergers using spectral numerical techniques @xcite , and the first steps towards modeling the flows of gas around the merging black holes @xcite .",
    "applications of the merger results in areas such as comparisons with pn expressions for the waveforms , astrophysical computations of black - hole merger rates , and the development of templates for gravitational - wave data analysis have accompanied these technical developments in the simulations .",
    "the study of black - hole mergers using numerical relativity is thriving indeed .",

    "the metric characterizes the geometry of spacetime by giving the infinitesimal spacetime interval @xmath70 through the following definition : @xmath71 where we use the einstein summation convention which implies summation over all values of a given index that appears twice in an expression .",
    "many physical implications of the metric are immediately apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : interval ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath72 , the resulting metric - determined relationship between the time and space coordinates yields the paths that light rays must follow in this spacetime .",

    "the familiar form of this equation suggests that its cauchy problem can be solved by specifying the metric and its first derivative on an initial , spatial surface and then integrating in time , as for an ordinary wave equation .",
    "einstein s equations admit various formulations and coordinate conditions , which should be tailored to the problem at hand  in this case , numerical simulation of black - hole spacetimes .",

    "the cauchy problem concerns solution of the field equations given initial data specified on an initial ( typically spatial ) hypersurface . in practice ,",
    "the cauchy problem is more conveniently investigated in a `` 3 + 1 '' formulation , explicitly based on a foliation of the spacetime into three - dimensional spatial slices parametrized by a time coordinate .",
    "a common 3 + 1 formulation inspired by adm @xcite divides up the components of the metric according to their relationships with space and time , such that the line element takes the form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is called the lapse function , @xmath78 the shift vector , and @xmath79 is the spatial three - metric .",

    "the lapse and shift represent coordinate freedom in the metric ; we can choose these quantities arbitrarily .",
    "however , since the three - metric @xmath52 ( and its first and second spatial derivatives ) determines the intrinsic curvature of the slice , it carries the information about the gravitational field and thus is constrained by the physics .",

    "how does one represent an exotic object such as a black hole in a numerical simulation ?",
    "in particular , how can one use finite computational methods repeatedly to model an object which , analytically , contains physical and/or coordinate singularities ?",
    "fortunately , two successful strategies have emerged to meet this challenge .",
    "the unusual topology of black holes offers one way out .",
    "as @xcite originally showed , a black hole can be considered a  bridge \" or  wormhole \" connecting one universe or  worldsheet \" , to a second worldsheet ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wormhole_flatspace ] ) . exploiting this topology , a continuous spatial slice which avoids",
    "the physical singularity contained within the event horizon of each black hole can be constructed as follows .",
    "starting with a spatial slice of schwarzschild spacetime , remove the interior of the event horizon .",
    "identify the resulting spherical boundary with the spherical boundary of an identical copy of this space .",
    "the two - dimensional analog would be to take two sheets of paper , cut out a disk from each , and then glue the resulting circular edges together .",
    "each sheet , or copy of schwarzschild spacetime in this example , is called a worldsheet .",
    "the identified spherical boundaries connecting the worldsheets form what is referred to as the  throat \" of the wormhole .    to complete this construction",
    ", we require an appropriate coordinate system to continuously cover both worldsheets .",
    "brill and lindquist discovered coordinates that will prove convenient , in which the three - metric of a particular spatial slice of schwarzschild spacetime is given by @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath25 is a radial coordinate . in these coordinates ,",
    "the event horizon is at @xmath114 .",
    "we can consider each of the worldsheets described above as being separately labeled by such coordinates .",
    "designate one worldsheet as @xmath115 and the other as @xmath116 , and call their radial coordinates @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "since the interior of the event horizon has been removed from each worldsheet , assume that @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the metric on each worldsheet has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bls ] ) .",
    "as noted by brill and lindquist , this form of the metric is unchanged by the transformation @xmath121 , and @xmath122 when @xmath114 .",
    "so if we define a new coordinate @xmath123 by @xmath124 mapping spatial infinity on worldsheet @xmath116 to @xmath125 , we obtain a single continuous coordinate system that applies to worldsheet @xmath115 for @xmath126 and worldsheet @xmath116 for @xmath127 .",
    "this avoidance of the physical singularity comes at the expense of a coordinate singularity in the metric at @xmath125 , called a `` puncture '' .",
    "however , it turns out this coordinate singularity can be confined to a single scalar variable , as suggested in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bls ] ) . with a suitable change of variables and other means ,",
    "numerical simulations haven proven capable of handling this irregular scalar field .",
    "thus the  puncture \" method is one way to represent a black hole that is amenable to computation .",
    "another strategy is excision , first proposed by unruh @xcite .",
    "given that no physical information can escape an event horizon to influence the exterior , the interior of a black hole can in principle be excised from the computational domain .",
    "this relies on the fact that all physical information propagates inwards from the event horizon towards the physical singularity , i.e. lightcones tilt inwards , and nothing physical propagates outward from the horizon .",
    "extrapolation can be used for the boundary condition of the excised region , and any nonphysical numerical error that escapes the horizon should be negligible .",
    "this approach is not constrained to the particular coordinates required by the puncture method , but it can be more difficult due to the need for precise positioning of the excision boundary and accurate extrapolation .",
    "excision was used successfully for orbiting binary simulations by @xcite and continues to be used by the caltech - cornell dual - coordinate spectral code @xcite .    either of these methods",
    "can be useful in representing black holes on the initial data slice .",
    "surprisingly , we will also see that either of these representations can be made robust enough to persist as the black holes evolve .",
    "the starting point for successful simulations of black - hole mergers is finding initial data for astrophysically realistic inspiralling black holes . if we were simulating the orbits of stars in newtonian gravity",
    ", this would be a simple procedure .",
    "for example , we could simply specify the masses and spins of the stars , along with their positions and velocities on orbits derived from the dynamics of point particles , and then evolve the system numerically to allow it to `` relax '' into orbits appropriate for bodies of finite size . in general relativity",
    ", however , the initial data must satisfy the constraint equations  ( [ eq : ham ] ) -  ( [ eq : mom ] ) , which are cast in terms of the @xmath128-metric @xmath52 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath53 . since there is no obvious , or natural , connection between these field variables and the astrophysical properties of inspiralling black holes , obtaining suitable initial data is a major challenge .",
    "building on the earlier work of @xcite , york developed a general procedure for solving the constraint equations to produce initial data for the cauchy problem in the 1970s ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this approach generally requires solving a coupled elliptic system of four nonlinear field equations .",
    "we can break this problem down into more manageable pieces with some simplifying assumptions .",
    "while these choices do come at the cost of some loss of generality and astrophysical realism in the initial data for two black holes , it has been seen that for sufficiently long evolutions the final orbits and waveform signatures from the black - hole evolution are largely insensitive to this level of detail in the initial data , at least in the case of equal - mass nonspinning black holes .",
    "the first simplification is to choose traceless extrinsic curvature , @xmath129 . with this ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is decoupled from the momentum constraints , and can be solved separately . to find solutions corresponding to multiple black holes",
    ", we generally further assume that the initial slice is conformally flat . that is , the three - metric is the product of a scalar conformal factor with a flat metric , @xmath130 with this , the problem reduces to solving a ( typically nonlinear ) equation for the scalar field @xmath131 .",
    "@xcite found a simple solution , representing @xmath42 black holes momentarily at rest , which gives @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the mass associated with the @xmath134th black hole and @xmath135 represents its coordinate center .",
    "each @xmath135 corresponds to the location of a puncture , as described in the last section .",
    "this is a valuable solution , but not generally useful , because these black holes lack momentum and spin .",
    "an explicit solution by bowen for the momentum constraint was the last crucial step in defining a procedure for calculating initial data for multiple black holes with specified linear and angular momenta @xcite .",
    "the bowen - york prescription employed a two - sheeted topology found by misner for the black - hole interiors @xcite . later brandt and brgmann generalized the procedure for the brill - lindquist topology @xcite .",
    "the brandt - brgmann puncture data for arbitrary momenta and spin is now widely used because of its ease of implementation .",
    "more recently york developed another modeling ansatz , known as the conformal - thin - sandwich ( cts ) approach @xcite , which has certain additional advantages .",
    "for example , it turns out the conventional brandt - brgmann puncture can not yield a spin parameter @xmath136 greater than @xmath137 @xcite , while cts data can go higher @xcite . as discussed above",
    ", the spatial metric is chosen to be conformally flat , then instead of providing an ansatz for the extrinsic curvature @xmath53 , the initial time - derivative of the conformal metric is specified ( generally to vanish ) .",
    "in addition , a condition can be imposed on the slicing ( see below ) .",
    "the result is a coupled system of elliptic equations which is solved to enforce the constraints and optionally the choice of slicing condition .",
    "boundary conditions may additionally be supplied to enforce rotational motion .",
    "either approach provides an ansatz for constructing three - dimensional binary black - hole initial _ field _ data for a specified choice of particle - like parameters , masses , positions , momenta , and spins .",
    "inevitably there are differences from the nearly quiescent evolving systems that we seek to represent .",
    "generally there is some level of spurious radiation generated from a period of initial transient dynamics through which the system relaxes to become quiescent on sub - orbital time scales . in particular ,",
    "extraneous radiation content is an unavoidable consequence of conformal flatness , which post - newtonian analysis has shown must deviate from the physically relevant inspiralling binary solution @xcite .",
    "this spurious radiation is seen in plots of the gravitational waveforms produced by mergers ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : universal_wf ] and other waveform plots in sec .",
    "[ sec : gws : universal ] .",
    "often the simulations will also undergo a period of initial gauge - evolution which , though physically inconsequential , may affect the quality of the simulation numerically .",
    "for puncture initial data @xcite analyzed some of these gauge dynamics , and developed a promising approach (  trumpet \" data ) to mitigate it ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : movepunc ] for related gauge issues ) .",
    "however , for simulations lasting for several orbits these modest transient effects are generally negligible .",
    "most black - hole binary simulation studies are designed to represent the astrophysical population of systems , which have circularized before the gravitational radiation becomes observationally significant .",
    "these simulations begin with circularly inspiralling initial data configurations .",
    "even before reliable numerical relativity simulations were possible , considerable attention had been given to prescribing initial data for these near - circular configurations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "within the cts approach , it is particularly natural to impose initially circular motion upon the system , resulting in an initial data prescription for quasicircular orbits @xcite . for either the cts or brandt - brgmann data ,",
    "quasicircular parameters may be chosen by constraints on either an effective gravitational potential or total energy of the system @xcite . for more realistic inspiralling trajectories ,",
    "the pn approximation may be used @xcite , or , for higher accuracy , an iterative procedure involving short numerical evolutions @xcite .",
    "the einstein evolution equations , which determine the time - development of the initial data , form a set of at least six coupled , nonlinear propagation equations .",
    "the exact formulation of these equations depends on the choice of evolved variables as well as how constraint identities are incorporated .",
    "although many formulations are possible , not all are equivalent from a numerical point of view .",
    "the choice of formulation can affect how numerical errors grow in time , and whether these errors can converge to zero as the resolution of the computational grid is increased .",
    "an ideal formulation is well - posed , meaning that : ( i ) for a given set of initial data , a unique solution exists , and ( ii ) solutions depend continuously on perturbations of the initial data . to determine whether a given formulation has the desirable property of well - posedness , we first consider it as a matrix equation : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a vector , the components of which represent the evolved variables such as components of the metric ; the linear operator @xmath140 is the principal part , containing the highest - order spatial derivatives ; and @xmath141 contains additional terms which may be nonlinear . certain conditions on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator @xmath140 in eq .",
    "are used to characterize the equations , typically as either `` strongly hyperbolic '' or `` weakly hyperbolic '' @xcite .",
    "if the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors form a complete set ( so any solution can be written as a linear combination of them ) , the equations are strongly hyperbolic . then , assuming adequate boundary conditions , the equations are well - posed and all solutions are bounded by a function that grows ( at most ) exponentially at a rate independent of the initial data .",
    "strong hyperbolicity is a key ingredient for successful black - hole merger simulations .    on the other hand , if the eigenvalues are real but the eigenvectors are not complete , the equations are weakly hyperbolic . in this case the equations are not well - posed , and they permit solutions which grow at rates that depend on the initial data .",
    "weak hyperbolicity implies that small numerical errors in the initial data may grow at a rate which depends on the resolution .",
    "it then becomes difficult to show that the numerical solution converges to a well - defined continuum solution , and at high resolutions the simulation may become unstable @xcite .      the quest for workable formulations of einstein s equations has proceeded along two parallel lines of development .",
    "one originated with consideration of  harmonic coordinates \" , so called because the coordinates satisfy the wave equation @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the curved - space wave operator . in these coordinates ,",
    "einstein s equations can be written such that the principal part resembles a wave equation in terms of the metric as in eq .  .",
    "in this form , einstein s equations are manifestly hyperbolic @xcite . however , the harmonic coordinate condition is too restrictive for numerical purposes , so generalized harmonic coordinates were eventually developed by introducing a source term into the coordinate condition , i.e. @xmath144 @xcite , a suitable choice for which preserves strong hyperbolicity .",
    "the subsequent introduction of _ constraint - damping _ terms , which tend to drive the constraints towards zero , further ensured stability @xcite .",
    "this formulation is manifestly second - order in both time and space , and has been implemented numerically as such @xcite , but for more efficient numerical integration a first - order - in - time formulation was also developed @xcite , and is currently being used by some groups .      a second line of development originated with the invention of the adm formulation of einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "this formulation was refined by @xcite , who suggested evolving the specific quantity of the extrinsic curvature ( eq .  ) .",
    "the associated evolution equations specify the first - order time - derivatives for the three - metric @xmath52 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath53 , as well as for the gauge variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 . however , the adm formulation is weakly hyperbolic ( see , e.g. , chapter 5 of @xcite ) , and attempts at stable numerical evolutions with it were not successful .",
    "there are essentially two ways to modify the adm equations that may affect their hyperbolicity ( while keeping them first - order in time and maintaining their 3 + 1 character ) .",
    "one way is to add the constraints , which may change the principal part of the equations without changing the associated physics .",
    "the other is to define new independent variables .",
    "simple addition of constraints failed to give a strongly hyperbolic formulation however .",
    "eventually it was found that strongly hyperbolic versions could be constructed from the adm equations by the promotion of certain derived quantities to the status of independently evolved variables @xcite .",
    "although strong hyperbolicity is important for a stable formulation , it is not the only property critical for accurate evolution . of the various strongly hyperbolic 3 + 1 formulations ,",
    "one eventually emerged as more successful than the rest .",
    "its development began with the observation that the numerical accuracy of @xmath145 , the determinant of the three - metric , and @xmath146 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature , could best be preserved by evolving these two quantities independently @xcite .",
    "subsequently , to remove the redundancy in evolving the full three - metric and extrinsic curvature , the conformal three - metric @xmath147 and conformal traceless extrinsic curvature @xmath148 were substituted @xcite . to eliminate certain terms with second derivatives ( which contribute to the principal part of this system ) , a new independently evolved variable @xmath149",
    "was also introduced @xcite .",
    "further improvements were made shortly afterwards , such as the addition of constraints to eliminate more second - derivative terms @xcite . the resulting formulation , now commonly known as bssn , proved to be robustly stable and accurate for numerical purposes .",
    "note that the above choices which comprise its form were empirically motivated , by identifying and eliminating terms which tended to compromise numerical accuracy . some analytic justification for its success",
    "was later found by @xcite , who showed that the bssn formulation avoids exponentially growing modes and most zero - speed modes , which accumulate numerical error .",
    "finally @xcite and @xcite proved that bssn is also strongly hyperbolic , given an appropriate choice of gauge .    a few noteworthy refinements of the bssn formulation followed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested adding specific terms proportional to the  gamma constraint \" ( @xmath150 minus its definition ) and the hamiltonian constraint into the evolution equations .",
    "these terms have the effect of damping the constraints and thereby improving stability .",
    "later , for evolution of punctures specifically , @xcite evolved the conformal factor in the form @xmath151 , which vanishes at the puncture ( an improvement in accuracy over the previous standard of @xmath152 , which is singular at the puncture ) .",
    "this change of variables , however , introduces the potentially singular factor @xmath153 into the evolution equations , necessitating an arbitrary restriction on the minimum value of @xmath154 .",
    "an alternative variable @xmath155 was subsequently suggested because resulting appearances of @xmath156 mostly cancel with factors of @xmath157 @xcite .      the choice of gauge or coordinate conditions , like the choice of formulation , has important consequences on the numerics , especially the stability of the simulation .",
    "important considerations include how to deal with the extreme conditions of black holes such as the physical singularities , the possible coordinate singularities , the strong - field gradients , and the dynamical , surrounding spacetime .",
    "the coordinates must accommodate these features in a way that is numerically tractable .",
    "an early consideration was how to avoid the physical singularity of a black hole through an appropriate slicing condition .",
    "one such choice , _",
    "maximal slicing _",
    ", required solution of a numerically expensive elliptic equation @xcite . later , an interest in constructing a hyperbolic evolution system led to a generalization of harmonic slicing known as the bona - mass family @xcite . one particular member of this family , called 1+log slicing , was found to also be singularity - avoiding , like maximal slicing , but at less numerical cost @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it was recognized that a shift vector was required to counter the large field gradients , or `` slice - stretching '' , incurred in the presence of a black hole @xcite . a hyperbolic shift condition called the `` gamma driver ''",
    "was introduced that fulfilled this requirement @xcite : @xmath158 where @xmath159 depends on a conformal three - metric @xmath160 of the evolving spatial slice , @xmath161 is an auxiliary variable , @xmath78 is the shift , and @xmath162 is some scalar field .",
    "@xmath163 is a damping parameter that fine - tunes the growth of the shift , which affects the coordinate size of the black - hole horizons , which in turn has bearing on the required numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "this shift condition also has the desirable tendency to drive the coordinates to quiescence in synchrony with the physics , for example after a binary merges into a stationary black hole .",
    "clearly if @xmath150 vanishes , @xmath161 is damped to zero and @xmath78 approaches a ( typically small ) constant .",
    "initially these conditions were intended for use with punctures that remained at fixed coordinate positions ( i.e. comoving coordinates ) , by choosing @xmath162 to vanish at the punctures . however , this led to large gradients between the merging black holes since there the metric had to vanish as the physical distance contracted .",
    "pathologies also arose from the twisting of the coordinates as the black holes orbited each other .",
    "these issues , which resulted in large numerical errors and instabilities , were eventually resolved with the breakthrough discovery that slight modifications of the 1+log and gamma - driver conditions allowed arbitrary motion of the punctures with robust stability @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the shift condition , a critical alteration was  unpinning \" the puncture by no longer requiring the factor @xmath162 to vanish at the puncture but rather to remain constant .",
    "these modifications were subsequently refined to eliminate zero - speed modes , thus preventing the possibility of error build - up @xcite .",
    "this was accomplished in part by the addition of advection terms : @xmath164 it is noteworthy that these particular gauge choices , coupled with the bssn equations , also result in strong hyperbolicity @xcite .",
    "a further refinement resulted from the observation that , assuming that @xmath165 initially , eqs .   and can be integrated to yield @xmath166 ; this substitution allows the removal of the equation for @xmath161 , leaving only a single shift equation @xcite : @xmath167 use of this or similar gauge conditions became known as the  moving puncture \" method , and proved to be very successful as it became increasingly widespread among the numerical - relativity community .",
    "analysis has verified that moving punctures are valid black - hole solutions , although the initial character of the punctures changes significantly during the course of evolution . the second worldsheet shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wormhole_flatspace ] , for example , invariably becomes disconnected in numerical simulations , at a point within the horizon near the throat , due to the action of the shift vector effectively shifting computational grid points onto the first worldsheet .",

    "the numerical result rapidly asymptotes to an exact form of the schwarzschild solution called a  trumpet \" , recently investigated by @xcite and @xcite , which turns out to be a type of solution first considered by @xcite .",
    "development of generalized harmonic coordinates initially proceeded independently of the above 3 + 1-formulated conditions .",
    "as mentioned , in harmonic coordinates the dalembertian of each coordinate vanishes . in generalized harmonic coordinates , the wave equation for each coordinate",
    "is allowed a source term , i.e. @xmath170 these  gauge driving \" source terms @xmath171 can be either algebraically specified or evolved such that hyperbolicity is preserved @xcite .",
    "the first successful numerical orbit of black holes involved a source term for the time coordinate that effectively kept the lapse close to its minkowski value of unity , while the spatial coordinates remained harmonic @xcite .",
    "this was accomplished by evolving the source term itself , according to @xmath172\\alpha^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are constants .",

    "the other advance is that of  dual coordinates \" . because moving punctures involve irregular fields , they are not easily made compatible with spectral methods , which are sensitive to irregularities .",
    "an alternative , that of a moving , excised region , can leave a large trail of interpolation error in its wake .",

    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and nested sampling . in both cases , a parametrized waveform model is needed . for the mcmc study ,",
    "a restricted pn waveform was used , only 1.5  pn in phase , but including leading spin effects .",
    "detection of injected signals performed well , but the high mass of the injections meant that the bulk of the snr occurred in the merger - ringdown phase ; as a result the inspiral - only model masses merger time was significantly biased .",
    "the nested sampling effort instead uses the taylorf2 templates ( restricted amplitude , 2.0  pn in phase ) as well as phenomenological templates . in detection",
    ", the phenomenological templates significantly out - perform the taylorf2 model ; in parameter estimation , it achieves results consistent with those of the matched - filter analysis .",
    "overall , current results are encouraging , with high detection rates of injected waveforms , and good , if limited , accuracy in estimated parameters when attempted with faithful template banks .",
    "however , the project was hampered by the limited length of the contributed waveforms and unrealistically stationary ligo and virgo noise profiles .",
    "follow - on work in this area will demand longer numerical waveforms that span the ligo sensitivity window , or more likely , a systematic blending of long pn inspiral waveforms to late - inspiral / merger numerical waveforms , but also may be extended to other gravitational - wave sources .",
    "the recent successes in modeling of binary black - hole mergers have captured the attention of astronomers and astrophysicists .",
    "while black - hole binaries have been studied both observationally and theoretically for many years , most efforts have been primarily within the framework of newtonian gravity .",
    "the new developments in numerical relativity now supply the missing piece : the effects of the final merger in the strong - field general relativistic regime . in this section",
    "we highlight three key areas of current interest : recoiling black holes , the spin of the merged black hole , and electromagnetic signatures from the final merger .",
    "one of the more dramatic implications of gravitational - wave computations for astrophysical observations is the possibility that gravitational radiation - induced recoil will eject black holes from their host galaxies .",
    "the largest recoil velocities predicted by numerical relativity exceed the escape velocities of many galaxies ( @xmath450 ) . calculating the probability of this kind of event",
    "requires a detailed understanding of the recoil on mass ratios , spin magnitudes , and spin orientations , together with some expectations about the distributions of these parameters .",
    "it would be useful to have in hand a simple , analytic formula expressing the relevant dependencies of the recoil velocity .",
    "the highly nonlinear , strong - field interactions of merger dynamics determine the final recoil velocity of the merged remnant .",
    "numerical simulations are required to accurately compute such results . however , in attempting to construct an ansatz for a phenomenological formula , one might initially assume a form consistent with pn predictions .",
    "this will suggest the functional dependence on mass and spin , and their leading powers .",
    "for example , pn analysis @xcite suggests that the recoil due to unequal masses may be proportional to @xmath451 ( the  fitchett formula \" ) , where @xmath254 is the symmetric mass ratio .",
    "meanwhile , to leading pn orders , the spins should contribute through components of @xmath452 and @xmath453 @xcite .",
    "such an ansatz can be further supported and constrained by symmetry arguments .",
    "an economical approach is to consider the recoil velocity as a taylor expansion in all six spin components ( three for each black hole ) , where the coefficients are functions of mass and initial separation .",
    "rotation , parity , and exchange symmetries of the binary system then impose relationships between these coefficients @xcite . by such arguments , for example , the component of the recoil velocity parallel to the orbital angular momentum can be shown to be proportional , to leading order in spin , to the dot product of the coordinate separation vector between the black holes and some linear combination of the spins @xcite .",
    "unknown coefficients in the ansatz can then be fit to numerical results , and correction terms can be added as needed for numerical agreement . with these considerations ,",
    "a tentative formula has been taking shape through the combined efforts of the numerical - relativity community , of the following form @xcite : @xmath454 \\nonumber\\\\                & + & \\frac{k_s(q-1)\\eta^2}{(q+1)^3 } \\nonumber\\\\                & \\times&\\left[q^2\\alpha^{\\perp}_1 \\cos(\\phi_1-\\phi_1)+\\alpha^{\\perp}_2\\cos(\\phi_2-\\phi_2)\\right ] \\label{eq : v_parallel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath455 is the contribution due to mass asymmetry , @xmath456 is the contribution due to spin that yields a kick perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum , @xmath457 is the contribution due to spin that yields a kick parallel to the orbital angular momentum , @xmath458 is the projection of the dimensionless spin vector @xmath459 of black hole @xmath134 along the orbital angular momentum , @xmath460 is the magnitude of its projection @xmath461 into the orbital plane , @xmath462 refers to the angle made by @xmath461 with respect to some reference angle in the orbital plane , and @xmath463 and @xmath464 are constants for a given mass ratio and initial separation . here",
    "the spins are considered to have been measured at some point before merger or ideally , arbitrarily close to merger . @xmath463 and",
    "@xmath464 encode the amount of precession of each spin before merger .",
    "one can then evaluate the formula over ranges of expected mass ratios and spin magnitudes , and for all spin orientations , to compute the probability of a given recoil speed .",
    "for example , for mass ratios between 1 and 10 , and spin magnitudes of 0.9 , the probability of exceeding @xmath59 is predicted to be @xmath216 .",
    "studies of various model - dependent speed probabilities are given by @xcite and @xcite .      among the significant astrophysical consequences of gravitational - radiation",
    "recoil , growth rates of black holes can be affected .",
    "for example , the recoil of massive black holes imparting less than the escape velocity of their host galaxies tends to have regulatory effects on the amount of mass accreted @xcite .",
    "recoil velocities that exceed galactic escape velocities can impact massive black - hole growth in a different way , by reducing the chances of subsequent mergers @xcite .",
    "this in turn may modestly reduce the rate of coalescence events observable by lisa @xcite .",
    "the recoil might also have more directly observable consequences .",
    "some quasars are thought to originate from the coalescence of massive black holes during galactic mergers .",
    "quasars ejected from their host galaxies might therefore be expected .",
    "a study by @xcite found no evidence for such events , indicating that they are rare .",
    "however , recent observations of two rapidly moving extragalactic quasars @xcite are strong candidates for such recoiled black holes @xcite .",
    "the final spin of the merged remnant of a binary is also of astrophysical interest",
    ". it would be useful to know the probability of various spin magnitudes in constructing matched filtering templates and estimating gravitational signal detectability for ligo and lisa @xcite .",
    "the ability to predict a final spin given initial binary parameters also implies that observation of the spin of a black hole may help understand its origin . in particular , an understanding of the relationship between the final spin of a black hole and the orbital angular momentum of its binary precursor may help explain the formation of x - shaped jets @xcite .    as with the kick",
    ", it would be advantageous to construct a simple analytic formula with which to estimate the spin .",
    "observations from numerical simulations suggest this might be possible .",
    "for example , in the case of nonspinning , equal - mass binaries undergoing circular inspiral , the final spin is insensitive to the initial separation , being determined by the terminal dynamics of the merger .",
    "such evolution results in a universal final spin of @xmath465 @xcite . additionally , for unequal - mass , nonspinning binaries ,",
    "the final spin scales roughly linearly with symmetric mass ratio @xcite .",
    "various approaches to constructing an ansatz for the final spin have been proposed . for aligned - spin , equal - mass mergers",
    ", @xcite produced a simple formula quadratic in the ( common ) initial spin ; this satisfied the `` cosmic censorship '' hypothesis : @xmath466 . for nonspinning mergers",
    ", @xcite simply assumed @xmath467 , for fitting parameters @xmath13 and @xmath468 , which agreed with data from nonspinning binaries reasonably well .",
    "@xcite arrived at a more generic ansatz , for initial black holes of arbitrary spins , using the pn approximation .",
    "@xcite proposed a different expression for generic binaries , using a set of assumptions about the approximate conservation of the magnitudes and relative angles of certain angular momentum vectors .",
    "several other formulas have been suggested @xcite , each in good agreement with some subset of available numerical data .",
    "however , broad agreement on an analytic formula for the final spin from generically precessing binaries has yet to be achieved .",
    "we have seen above that black - hole mergers are expected to be `` loud , '' since they produce strong gravitational - wave signals .",
    "but will they also be `` bright ? ''",
    "that is , will there be an accompanying display of photons , detectable by telescopes in any frequency range of the full electromagnetic spectrum ?",
    "the answer to this question depends critically on the amount and distribution of gas and magnetic fields surrounding the merging binary . for stellar black - hole binaries , and intermediate - mass black - hole binaries in stellar clusters ,",
    "any matter in an accretion disk would be consumed by one or both black holes and disappear relatively quickly , making an electromagnetic counterpart highly unlikely .",
    "massive black - hole binaries formed from galaxy mergers , however , present a very different situation . in a gas - rich or `` wet '' merger",
    ", there is likely enough gas available to feed accretion disks around each black hole that eventually evolve into a circumbinary disk ; this provides a source of gas and magnetic fields that could generate detectable electromagnetic emission . even in the case of gas - poor or `` dry '' mergers ,",
    "the thin hot gas present is such ( elliptical ) galaxies might be sufficient to produce an electromagnetic signature .",
    "such electromagnetic signatures would be valuable to astrophysics .",
    "identification of the source on the sky would help confirm and characterize the merger , and probe accretion physics .",
    "a measurement of its redshift using electromagnetic radiation , taken together with the determination of luminosity distance using gravitational waves observed by lisa @xcite , would provide an independent calibration of the distance scale and a precise probe of cosmology including the nature of the mysterious dark energy @xcite .",
    "differences in arrival times of the electromagnetic and gravitational - wave signatures could also test fundamental principles such as the relative propagation speed of photons and gravitational waves .    with the recent successes in numerical - relativity modeling of black - hole mergers , we find considerable interest in understanding possible electromagnetic signals from these events .",
    "most work to date has focused on mechanisms that could produce emission from a surrounding accretion disk , including signals induced by a recoiling merged black hole encountering the disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , explorations of possible electromagnetic signals that could arise in the dynamic spacetime near the binary during its last few orbits and merger are just now beginning .",
    "@xcite recently studied the effects of a merging black - hole binary on a surrounding magnetic field .",
    "the equal - mass , nonspinning holes start out with separation @xmath469 on quasicircular orbits somewhat outside the isco .",
    "the magnetic field is initially poloidal and assumed to be generated by currents in a distant circumbinary disk located at @xmath470 .",

    "as the system evolves , the inspiralling black holes stir up the fields .     before the merger , from @xcite .",

    "the magnetic fields are mostly aligned with the @xmath34 axis , while the electric fields are twisted around the black holes .",
    "the binary dynamics induce oscillations in the electromagnetic energy flux , with a period approximately half of the dominant ( quadrupole ) gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the energy in the electromagnetic field is also enhanced gradually .",
    "@xcite have certainly made an interesting start on this important problem .",
    "can this scenario generate detectable electromagnetic emission ?",
    "the answer awaits more realistic simulations , including spinning black holes .",
    "other astrophysical scenarios allow both matter and magnetic fields in the vicinity of the binary close to merger . in this case ,",
    "calculation of possible electromagnetic signatures requires solving the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a dynamically evolving spacetime governed by the einstein equations .",
    "@xcite took a step towards solving this problem by mapping the flow of pressureless matter , modeled as non - interacting point particles , in the dynamical spacetime around the merging black holes .",
    "they started with a distribution of particles around the black - hole binary , and then evolved the binary using numerical relativity while tracing the motion of the particles along geodesics as the binary evolves . to estimate the energetics of the flow",
    ", they detected `` collisions '' by looking for particles within a small distance ( typically , @xmath473 ) of each other and then calculating the lorentz factors @xmath474 in the center - of - mass frame of each collision .",
    "they began with equal - mass inspiralling black - hole binaries @xmath475 orbits before merger , and considered both black holes to have either zero spin , or @xmath476 with spin vectors aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum .",
    "a single black hole of mass @xmath9 is also evolved as a control case .",
    "approximately 75,000 geodesic particles are then initially distributed uniformly throughout a solid annulus centered on the binary and having inner radius @xmath477 , outer radius @xmath478 , and vertical full thickness @xmath479 .",
    "particles within the inner radius are excluded , to avoid transient signatures from particles initially near the horizons .",
    "note that these circumbinary disks are geometrically thick , and thus potentially have high enough inward radial speeds to keep up with the shrinking separation of the inspiralling binary , providing a source of gas near the black holes during their merger @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied two initial velocity configurations for the particles . in the `` orbital '' configuration ,",
    "the initial velocities are randomly distributed around a tangential velocity @xmath480 that would give a circular orbit in a schwarzschild spacetime of mass @xmath9 , resulting in a scale height of @xmath481 . in contrast",
    ", the `` isotropic '' configuration is an extreme ( that is , very hot ) case in which the particles only have random velocities , with each component sampled from a gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath482 .    for the orbital initial velocities ,",
    "the particles remain mostly in a rotational configuration ; some particles do enter the region around the black holes , but are soon ejected by a gravitational slingshot .",
    "the collisions typically occur at relatively low velocities with lorentz factors @xmath483 . by the time of merger , there are essentially no particles near the black holes , and thus there is no energetic signature of the merger .",
    "the situation is quite different with the isotropic initial conditions , which provide a continual influx of particles throughout the evolution .",
    "moreover , there is a clear signature of the merger visible in the maximum lorentz factor , which takes on values @xmath484 during the inspiral and spikes up to @xmath485 just before merger for the nonspinning case . for rotating black holes , @xmath486 during the inspiral , spiking to @xmath487 just before merger .",
    "in addition , gravitational torques from the merging binary effectively stir the particle distribution , leading to high - velocity outflows with particles reaching @xmath488 or more .",
    "@xcite point out that , in realistic astrophysical disks , viscosity would cause angular momentum transport , bringing material inward towards the merging black holes .",
    "this could produce a scenario between the two extremes they studied , with a clear merger signal .",
    "more recent work by @xcite , using hydrodynamical simulations of gas around black - hole binaries , provided strong support in this regard .",
    "further confirmation of this interesting possibility , along with other mechanisms involving general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics , awaits more detailed simulations with gas and magnetic fields , currently in development .",
    "five years ago , we did not know what obstacles might conspire to prevent the effective application of numerical - relativity simulations in deriving predictions of general relativity to address questions of astrophysical black - hole binaries . up to that time , the numerical relativity researchers addressed their research primarily to questions of theoretical and computational physics .",
    "then , quite suddenly , the last obstacles vanished .",
    "as reported , numerical relativity can now be applied to understand general relativity s predictions of strong - field gravitational physics and to begin addressing questions of astrophysics and gravitational - wave data analysis .",
    "we expect future work in this field to be guided not by internal problems in gravitational theory , but by questions of astrophysics , and other areas where strong - field gravitational theory applies",
    ". these questions will motivate both continued , more detailed , investigation of some of the phenomena which have already been revealed , and the development of new capabilities to bring simulation results to bear on new questions .",
    "though the work has begun in applying numerical - relativity results to gravitational - wave observations , much more work is still needed .",
    "it is now clear that the signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio from the last moments of the merger will dominate over the inspiral signal in many potential observations .",
    "though numerical - relativity simulations have shed considerable light on the basic features of the burst of gravitational radiation that completes the predicted signals , applications in data analysis will require _ comprehensive _ quantitative knowledge of the merger signals generated over the full parameter space of mergers .",
    "while we discussed examples of mergers that sample the binary black - hole parameter space along what may be its principal axes , a full quantification of the signal space will require a long systematic program of investigation .",
    "even with the aid of empirical models for encoding numerical results , many simulations must be conducted to qualify possible models .",
    "initial models suitable for detection and ( perhaps ) parameter estimation of low - snr signals , will require much further development for application to the high - snr observations expected with future instrument upgrades , such as advanced ligo , and future instruments such as lisa .",
    "considerably more simulations of high quality will be required to achieve these goals .",
    "in addition to understanding the signals generated by mergers through the bulk of parameter space in greater depth , relativists must also extend the region of parameter space covered by simulations .",
    "typical current simulations are limited in the range of parameters that can be practically covered .",
    "currently popular initial data models , particularly those assuming conformal flatness , are limited to @xmath489 @xcite .",
    "alternatives more suited to rapidly spinning kerr black holes are less well developed in other ways .",
    "while astrophysical limits on spin magnitudes remain unclear , it is likely that larger spins will have to be treated with possibly novel initial data models .",
    "other , related challenges in the simulations may also exist .",
    "current simulations are also restricted to comparable mass ratios .",
    "simulations beyond @xmath490 require somewhat heroic investments of computational resources with present techniques .",
    "astrophysical mergers may occur , however , over a broad range of mass ratios . in the limit of extremely large mass ratios , approximation techniques are possible that treat the motion of the smaller object as a perturbed geodesic in the spacetime of the larger black hole .",
    "such analytic methods look promising in this limit , where numerical simulations are less practical . however , there is a rather large middle ground , say @xmath491 , where new techniques may be required .",
    "one problem is that the small spatial scale of the smaller black hole requires extremely small timesteps for stable explicit time integrations , even though there is nothing interesting happening on these timescales .",
    "alternatives such as implicit schemes @xcite may open the door to a broader range of applications .",
    "most of the simulations discussed also focus on circular , or nearly circular orbits .",
    "while this is clearly an important portion of the black - hole - binary population , scenarios have been proposed in which one black hole captures another from nearly parabolic initial encounters .",
    "understanding the potential signals from such systems may require new techniques appropriate for long periods of slow , effectively newtonian evolution , punctuated by brief periods of strong gravitational interaction .",
    "as discussed , the numerical discovery of strong gravitational - wave recoils in asymmetric mergers of spinning black holes has had significant impact in areas of astrophysics beyond direct gravitational - wave observations .",
    "these results have spurred excitement in the black - hole astronomy community about other possible applications of numerical relativity . since other areas of astronomy",
    "are based on ( primarily ) electromagnetic observations , these interactions naturally lead to applications involving the interactions of black holes and electromagnetically visible matter .",
    "there are many relevant phenomena of interest : accretion disks around black holes , possibly disturbed by gravitational recoil , black - hole  neutron - star binaries , neutron - star  neutron - star binaries , jets from active galactic nuclei , quasars , and the mysterious origins of gamma ray bursts .    a key direction for future work has been adding physics beyond the purely gravitational simulations we have reviewed here .",
    "as discussed , efforts are currently underway to use and develop magnetohydrodynamics in a dynamical spacetime . as such simulations are applied with increasing realism to more astrophysical scenarios , refinement of the techniques will be required .",
    "adequately resolving shocks and turbulence interacting with magnetic fields , achieving robust accuracy in the presence of very strong magnetic fields , and enforcing the vanishing divergence of the magnetic fields , all in curved spacetime , are among the challenges that need to be met .",
    "astrophysical mergers typically involve nearly circular orbits , or in extreme scenarios , initially parabolic encounters .",
    "numerical simulations can be applied to other sorts of black - hole interactions as well .    for high - velocity black - hole encounters ,",
    "one expects a phase transition dividing the spacetimes in which the black holes merge from those in which they pass each other hyperbolically , never to approach each other again : see fig .",
    "[ fig : crit_traj ] . numerical simulation studies are beginning to elucidate critical behavior near this phase transition @xcite .",

    "these include the first tests of higher - order terms in the pn expansion and , indeed , of the physical predictions which numerical relativity is just now revealing .",
    "the possibility that general relativity will find its limits in these observations motivates a better understanding of what waveforms might be predicted by alternative theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "alternative - gravity models of black - hole mergers would also likely require numerical simulation to derive waveform predictions , but little work has been done in this direction so far [ see one related example from @xcite ] .",
