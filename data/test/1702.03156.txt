    "over the past two decades , the discovery of broad - lined type ic supernovae ( sne ic - bl ; see * ? ? ? * for the classification of known sne ) and superluminous sne ( slsne ) has greatly enlarged the family of known core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) .",
    "the association between long - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 980425 and its spectroscopically associated ic - bl sn  1998bw @xcite , i.e. the so - called grb - sn connection @xcite , ignited interest in these energetic and rare type of stripped - envelope ccsne .",
    "to date , the luminosity of most , if not all , grb - sne and sne ic - bl could be explained by radioactive heating arising from energy deposition from the radioactive decay of nickel and cobalt , which is nucleosynthesized during the explosion , into their daughter products @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that the luminosity of many slsne can not be adequately explained in this scenario , and alternative energy sources have been proposed . as a consequence ,",
    "it is now usually assumed that at least a subclass of slsne , type ic slsne , are powered by millisecond magnetars @xcite although there is evidence for interaction between ejecta and circumstellar medium @xcite at late times .    for sne ic - bl , shortcomings of one - dimensional @xmath0ni model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stimulated the suggestion for a two - component @xmath0ni model @xcite . in this model",
    "it is assumed that the ejecta are composed of two components , the outer fast - moving component ( jet ) and the inner slow - moving component ( core ) .",
    "the former is responsible for the bright peak of the light curve , while the latter is responsible for the late - time exponential decay .",
    "this model is very useful for providing a better description of the ejecta structure and has been very successful in reproducing the luminosity of all sne ic - bl .",
    "it is only recently that the application of the magnetar model to sne ic - bl was seriously considered @xcite , following the early suggestions @xcite .",
    "the proposition of the improved magnetar model @xcite , which takes into account the photospheric recession and acceleration of the ejecta by the spinning - down magnetar , provides an opportunity to examine the magnetar model against sne ic - bl in a self - consistent way .",
    "it was shown that the spin - down of the magnetar will lose a small fraction of its rotational energy to its light curve @xcite , while the remaining fraction is transferred into the kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "evidence for the formation of stable magnetars following the explosions of sne ic - bl was subsequently found by @xcite .",
    "such a model can also naturally account for the mysterious origin of the huge kinetic energies of sne ic - bl @xcite .",
    "the discovery of relativistic sne ic - bl , 2009bb and 2012ap , through their bright late - time radio emission @xcite places the magnetar model on a more solid ground because such events require central engines to accelerate a tiny fraction of the ejecta to quasi - relativistic velocities @xcite .",
    "actually there is a continuous distribution of various types of ccsne on the kinetic energy profile of the ejecta .",
    "the relativistic sne ic - bl lie in between ordinary sne ibc and energetic grbs and are similar to the sub - energetic grbs , e.g. grb  100316d @xcite and grb 140606b @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that similar engines were operating in sub - energetic grbs and sne 2009bb and 2012ap .",
    "based on the above findings , here we test the hypothesis that all of sne ic - bl are powered by magnetars . under such hypothesis , we assessed the validity of the derived fitting parameters and consider the statistical characteristics of sne ic - bl .",
    "despite the paucity of observed sne ic - bl , the accumulation of such events has reached a level where a meaningful statistical results can start to be obtained .",
    "it is therefore very timely to confront a larger sample ( @xmath2 ) of sne ic - bl with the magnetar model .    to determine the uncertainties in the fitting parameters",
    ", @xcite developed a markov chain monte carlo  ( mcmc ) code on the basis of the magnetar model .",
    "this code was applied to slsne ic @xcite to minimize the total errors arising from fitting the model to the sn light curves , and evolution of photospheric velocity and temperature , if available . in this paper",
    "we focus on the sne ic - bl not associated with grbs . in what follows we use the words sne ic - bl \" to indicate sne ic - bl not associated with grbs except when specifically mentioned otherwise .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : data ]",
    "we present the data available in the literature , along with a detailed analysis on the uncertainties of the data .",
    "then in section [ sec : result ] we present our fitting results of the known sne ic - bl . section [ sec : dis ] discusses the implications of the results .",
    "particularly , section sec : t_neb discusses the estimation of the appearance of nebular features by early light curve modeling ; section [ sec : cor ] discusses the correlations between the derived parameters ; section [ sec : alter ] discusses the possibility of alternative models to interpret the light curves and velocity evolution of some sne .",
    "a summary is given in section sec : conclusion .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * notes . * in these fits , we fixed @xmath3 .",
    "the high fitting quality of the magnetar+@xmath0ni model can be most easily appreciated by comparing the reproduced light curves of sn 2002ap by these two models .",
    "the ejecta masses given by the pure - magnetar model are frequently unreasonable , e.g. sn 2002ap and ptf10vgv . for sn 1997ef ,",
    "the magnetar+@xmath0ni model is favored not only because of the smaller reduced @xmath4 compared to the pure - magnetar model , but also because of the broad peak of this sn , as found by @xcite . comparing figures fig:1997ef(a ) and [ fig : pure - mag](a )",
    "indicates that the magnetar+@xmath0ni model captures the broad peak of this light curve better than the pure - magnetar model , see figure 1 in @xcite for a clearer rendering . for sne 2003jd , 2007ru , and 2010ah , the contribution of @xmath0ni is not necessary to give an acceptable fitting result .    to fit the light curves by the pure - magnetar model , the velocity fitting results are frequently bad , e.g. sne 2002ap and ptf10vgv ( see figure fig : pure - mag ) , besides the above mentioned sn 2007bg .",
    "the low velocities are required for these sne in the pure - magnetar model because of the slow decline rates of the light curves .",
    "the above results indicate that the magnetar+@xmath0ni model is the best model in reproducing the light curves and velocity evolutions of the sne ic - bl sample , although some sne can also be well described by the two - component @xmath0ni model ( e.g. , sne 1997ef , 2002ap ) , while some others ( e.g. , sne 2003jd , 2007ru , and 2010ah ) can also be well reproduced by the pure - magnetar model .",
    "we note that different models usually give different explosion times , as can be found by comparing @xmath5 presented in tables [ tbl : para ] , [ tbl : pure-56ni ] , and [ tbl : pure - mag ] .",
    "tables [ tbl : para ] and tbl : pure - mag show that the explosion times determined by the magnetar+@xmath1ni model are all later than that determined by the pure - magnetar model , with ptf10vgv the only exception . this can be well understood . to account for the late - time light curves , the spin - down timescales of the magnetars in the pure - magnetar model have to be longer than in the magnetar+@xmath1ni model .",
    "this will result in slow rise rate and therefore the explosion times must be somewhat earlier .",
    "the slow rise rates in the pure - magnetar model suffer from some tension with the upper limits of the light curves of sne 2003jd , 2007ru , 2010ah , as can be seen from figure fig : pure - mag .",
    "comparison of @xmath5 in tables [ tbl : para ] and tbl : pure-56ni shows that the explosion times in the magnetar+@xmath0ni model are usually later than that in the @xmath0ni model , except for sn 2010ay .",
    "this can be understood by comparing the spin - down timescale of the magnetar , @xmath6 , with the @xmath0ni decay timescale , @xmath7 .",
    "it is found that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 for sne 2009bb , 2010ay , 2012ap , ptf10qts , respectively .",
    "if @xmath12 , the energy of the magnetar is released more rapidly in the magnetar model than in the @xmath1ni model , the rise time in the magnetar model is shorter than in the @xmath1ni model .",
    "this is why the explosion time of sn 2010ay in the magnetar model is earlier than in the @xmath0ni model because in this case @xmath13 .",
    "by this way , it is not difficult to understand why the explosion time of sn 1997ef is almost coincident with the discovery date in the magnetar+@xmath0ni model . from table [ tbl : para ] it is found that @xmath14 for this sn .",
    "the energy was almost explosively released .",
    "the mechanism for the formation of sne ic - bl is still unclear .",
    "recently there is strong evidence that sne ic - bl are powered by magnetars @xcite .",
    "indeed , for all of the sne ic - bl that were observed to phases @xmath15 when the contribution from @xmath0ni decays significantly , there is clear evidence for magnetar formation .",
    "motivated by this evidence , we studied a sample of @xmath2 sne ic - bl and obtain their light curve fitting parameters . from this study",
    "it is evident that the sample of sne ic - bl can be reasonably described by our magnetar model .",
    "the magnetar model naturally reduces the needed @xmath0ni and simultaneously accounts for the origin of the huge kinetic energies observed in sne ic - bl , with only two exceptions , sne 2010ay and ptf10qts , which could be attributed to the poor quality of the light curves .",
    "we also examine the possibility for the pure-@xmath0ni or pure - magnetar model to explain the light curve and velocity evolution .",
    "it is found that sn 2010ay is in tension with the @xmath0ni model , while sne 2003jd , 2007ru , and 2010ah are compatible with the pure - magnetar model .",
    "our results indicate that the synthesized @xmath0ni mass does not increase with explosion energy or neutron star rotational energy .",
    "the @xmath0ni mass is consistent with ordinary sne .",
    "the relation between explosion energy and neutron star rotational energy seems to imply a common energy reservoir for these two energies .",
    "it seems to indicate that the amplification of magnetic field of the neutron star is independent of the explosion energy . to get a more robust statistical result ,",
    "more observations are definitely needed .",
