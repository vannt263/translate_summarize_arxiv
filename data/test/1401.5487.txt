    "variable c in m33 , one of the original hubble - sandage variables is a known s doradus variable / classical luminous blue variable ( lbv ) in m33 @xcite .",
    "a classical lbv in quiescence ( minimum visual light ) resembles a moderately evolved hot star with the spectrum of an early b - type supergiant or of / late wn star @xcite . during an lbv eruption , the mass loss rate increases ,",
    "the wind becomes opaque and cool , and its spectrum resembles an a  f - type supergiant .",
    "since this is a shift in the bolometric correction , the star brightens in the visual and appears to move to the right , to lower temperatures on the hr diagram .",
    "this is the lbv s optically thick wind stage or maximum visual light .",
    "var c s historic light curve is discussed by @xcite .",
    "it has shown two relatively long periods of maximum light ; from 1940 - 1953 @xcite and 1982 - 1993 @xcite with two shorter maxima in 1964 - 1970 @xcite and again beginning in 2001 and lasting until about 2005 based on the photometry and spectra reported by @xcite .",
    "var c entered another lbv eruption or maximum light phase apparently beginning close to 2011.0 when it brightened about two magnitudes in the visual reaching v @xmath0 15.6 mag @xcite .    in this _",
    "we describe its spectrum obtained just before the onset of its current brightening and recent spectra from its present maximum .",
    "interestingly , we find that its outflow or wind speed shows little change between these two states and is slow even during quiescence ; much slower than the winds of comparable b - type supergiants . this observation may be a significant clue to the lbv instability in general .",
    "variable c was observed on 03 october 2010 and on 07 october 2013 with the hectospec multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) @xcite on the 6.5-m mmt on mt .",
    "hopkins as part of a larger program on luminous stars in m31 and m33 @xcite .",
    "the hectospec has a 1@xmath1 fov and uses 300 fibers each with a core diameter of 250@xmath2 m subtending 1@xmath35 on the sky .",
    "we used the 600 l / mm grating with the 4800 tilt yielding @xmath4 2500 coverage with 0.54  / pixel resolution and r of @xmath5 2000 .",
    "the same grating with a tilt of 6800 was used for the red spectra with @xmath4 2500 coverage , 0.54 / pixel resolution and r of @xmath5 3600 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using an exportable version of the cfa / sao specroad package for hectospec data .",
    "the spectra were all bias subtracted , flatfielded and wavelength calibrated .",
    "because of crowding , the sky subtraction was done using fibers assigned outside the field of the galaxy .",
    "blue and red spectra were also observed on 06 january 2014 with the mods1 spectrograph on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
    "mods1 uses a dichroic to obtain blue and red spectra simultaneously with the g400l and g750l gratings for the blue and red channels , respectively , yielding wavelength coverage from 3200 in the blue to more than 1@xmath2 m in the red .",
    "the spectra were reduced using a pipleine provided by r. w. pogge for mods spectra and standard routines in iraf .",
    "figure 1 shows the recent light curve based on photometry from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and from martin s ccd observations with the 20-inch telescope at the barber observatory .",
    "although there are gaps in the present photometry , we suspect that the current eruption began approximately 2011.0 rather than in mid-2010 .",
    "this is on based var c s spectrum in oct 2010 when it was still in its hot or quiescent state , and because at the beginning of the 1982  1993 eruption it showed a rapid rise to maximum in only a few weeks @xcite .",
    "soon after the announcement that var c had brightened , several groups obtained low resolution spectra of variable c. all of the known spectroscopic observations beginning with the 2010 spectra are listed in table 1 . both sets of our blue and red spectra from the mmt / hectospec",
    "are shown in figure 2 .",
    "var c s spectrum in october 2010 shows the absorption line spectrum of an early b - type supergiant plus emission lines of hydrogen with p cygni profiles , and he i , fe ii and [ fe ii ] .",
    "the multiplet 42 fe ii lines also have prominent p cygni absorption profiles .",
    "the presence of absorption lines of n ii 3995 , several he i absorption lines and s iv 4089 in the blue suggest a corresponding b1 - b2 spectral type .",
    "the n ii lines 4600 4640 and 5666  5710 and s iii 4553  4575  are also present in absorption .",
    "the relative strengths of the nebular [ n ii ] emission lines indicate that var c has a circumstellar nebula @xcite .",
    "its spectrum three years later , after the rise to maximum light , shows the transition in apparent spectral type that characterizes the classical lbv or s doradus variability ( figure 2 ) .",
    "its absorption line spectrum now resembles a late a - type supergiant with prominent ca ii h and k absorption lines , strong mg ii @xmath64481 , and numerous absorption lines of fe ii .",
    "the luminosity sensitive o i triplet at @xmath67774 is quite strong . the si ii doublet at 6347 and 6371 and the three",
    "n i lines from 7423  7468 are present in absorption in its red spectrum .",
    "the he i emission and absorption lines are gone .",
    "the balmer emission line strengths have decreased , by a factor of two in equivalent width for h@xmath7 .",
    "the hydrogen lines have developed broad wings extending to @xmath4 800 km s@xmath8 , most likely due to thomson scattering in the dense wind , and the p cygni absorption is now much stronger indicating that the mass loss rate has increased .",
    "the wings contain roughly 20% of the h@xmath7 and h@xmath9 emission ( figure 3 ) .",
    "likewise the lines of fe ii multiplet 42 have prominent p cygni absorption features and asymmetric red wings , a characteristic of thomson scattering .",
    "a spectrum from january 2014 confirms the above description and also shows the ca ii triplet in emission in the far red ; two of the ca ii line have p cygni profiles .",
    "thomson - scattered line wings almost automatically appear when a hot star s mass outflow becomes opaque .",
    "in such a case the diffuse continuum photosphere roughly coincides with the thermalization depth , located where @xmath10 . with likely opacities , this occurs near scattering depth @xmath11 2 to 5 @xcite .",
    "naturally the strongest emission lines are formed in the region outside the diffuse photosphere , i.e. , with an average @xmath12 of the order of 1 or 2 ; and this is about the right depth to produce the observed line wings .",
    "@xcite have noted this generality for other types of objects .",
    "var c was observed during its previous extended maximum , 1982  1993 @xcite .",
    "comparison with spectra from that time shows that the current spectrum is somewhat warmer than the 1985 spectrum obtained when the star was about two years past the onset of the eruption . at that time , it had the spectral characteristics and absorption line strengths of an early f - type supergiant . instead the current spectrum is more like spectra from 1986 and 1987 when it resembled an a - type supergiant and had an apparent temperature of @xmath4 9000k .",
    "this is consistent with the light curve .",
    "like other well - observed lbvs in eruption , var c s apparent spectrum / temperature is correlated with the amplitude of its visual brightening @xcite .",
    "var c has not gotten as visually bright as it did in 1985 . as of this writing ,",
    "its maximum visual magnitude is 15.6 compared to 15.2 mag in 1985 .",
    "its brightness and colors are essentally the same as the 1986/1987 photometry and the spectra are likewise very similar .",
    "thus the dense wind during this maximum may not get as cool , although of course that will depend on how the light curve develops in the future .",
    "lbv s are well known to have low wind or outflow velocities of 100 - 200 km s@xmath8 in their cool , dense winds during their eruptions or maximum light phase . to examine var c s wind",
    ", we measured the velocity at the blue - edge of the p cygni absorption profiles in the balmer and fe ii emission lines .",
    "this velocity is usually referred to as the terminal velocity ( @xmath13 ) , but since we are not using a stellar wind model to fit the profiles , here we call it the blue - edge velocity",
    ". we also measured the velocity at the absorption minimum in the p cygni profiles .",
    "this second method is less subjective than the blue - edge and permits a well - controlled differential measurement .",
    "the velocity of the absorption minimum is of course smaller , but when comparing the velocities from different times , the results are consistent with the behavior of the terminal or blue - edge velocity .",
    "the average velocities with their standard deviations are summarized in table 2 for the quiescent and maximum light spectra .",
    "the h@xmath7 and h@xmath9 line profiles at the two epochs are shown in figure 3 .    for comparison",
    ", we also include the wind speeds from the p cygni profiles in the balmer lines in the spectra of normal early b - type and late a - type supergiants in m31 and m33 observed with the hectospec at the same time as var c in 2010 (  1 and paper i ) .",
    "the line profiles were measured the same way as for var c. wind speeds are expected to have some dependence on metallicity .",
    "although we do not have a measured metallicity for var c , we expect it to be similar to the other supergiants in m33 which has a metallicity like the lmc while m31 stars have galactic abundances .",
    "furthermore we do not find a significant difference in the wind velocities for the m31 and m33 stars in this small sample .",
    "var c s outflow velocities are significantly less , by at least 70 km s@xmath8 or about 30% than for the normal b - type supergiants in m31 and m33 even in quiescence when the lbv s apparent spectral type and spectroscopic temperature are like that of the hot supergiants @xcite ] . during the dense wind or maximum",
    "light phase the outflow velocities are similar to those of the a - type supergiants , which var c resembles spectroscopically , although still somewhat lower .",
    "_ var c thus has a slow wind even during the quiescent stage in comparison with the normal hot supergiants with similar temperatures .",
    "there is also only a small decrease in the wind speeds between these two states .",
    "_    we also find a relatively low wind velocity in the other lbvs in m31 and m33 in their hot or quiescent state , discussed in paper ii in our series on the luminous stars in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus a slower and presumably denser wind , even in quiescence or minimum light , may be another distinguishing characteristic of the classical lbvs / s doradus variables .",
    "a hot star should have a wind speed related to the escape velocity .",
    "lbvs are presumably close to the eddington limit @xcite having already shed much of their mass in previous s dor - type maxima or possibly in enhanced mass loss during a previous giant eruption .",
    "their effective gravities and therefore their escape velocities are now much lower .",
    "the var c observations support this concept , i.e. that it is fairly close to the eddington limit .",
