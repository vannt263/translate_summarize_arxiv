    "after the release of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( ) 1-year results ( hereafter wmapi ) refs .  , , , the issue of non - gaussianity of the cmb has attracted great attention . in the papers",
    "refs .  , , , , , , , , , ,",
    ", various kinds of methods have been employed and departure of gaussianity have been detected .",
    "these features can be of primordial origin ( refs .  , ) or they could be related to foreground residuals ( refs .  , , ) or any sort of systematic effects ( ) .",
    "recently the team released the 3-year data ( hereafter wmapiii ) ref .   producing internal linear combination map ( ilc(iii ) ) available for scientific analysis at the multipole range @xmath6 .",
    "the team performed the analysis of gaussianity for the ilc(iii ) signal that does not include harmonics @xmath7 and showed that the cmb signal is gaussian ref .",
    "however , as it was cautioned by the team , the alignment and planarity at multipoles @xmath8 and 5 mentioned in refs .  , , , , still present in the map ( see recent investigation in ref .  ) . if breaking of statistical isotropy in the low multipoles is of primordial origin , a very fundamental issue is consequently raised : what cosmological model can provide such a peculiar structure in the cmb angular distribution on the sky  ?",
    "in refs .  , and it has been pointed out that breaking of statistical isotropy in the low multipoles can be explained and in favor of the bianchi viih model . however , helling , shupp and tesilleanu ( ref .  ) have also pointed out that @xmath8 and 5 have anti - alignment in the direction of non - cosmological dipole and argued that accurate technique of the cmb signal subtraction probably needs to be non - linear ( with respect to dipole treatment ) to prevent any residuals from the dipole in the map .",
    "in addition , methods of foreground separation for the cmb signal very likely leave foreground residuals in the cmb map , a problem that can be illustrated by cross - correlation between the derived signal and the foregrounds . for the wmapi data this problem was already investigated in refs .",
    ", , , , , . for wmapiii data",
    ", it has been shown in refs .",
    ", that the low multipoles in ilc(iii ) clearly display significant cross - correlation with the derived foregrounds , while ref .   showed that negative peak at @xmath9 ) has no analogue in the foreground map . in refs .  , analyzing the map - making algorithm ( mma ) it has been pointed out that it could produce some residuals from the non - cosmological dipole ( related with the motion of our galaxy in the local group ) and any non - gaussian features can `` naturally '' arise as the result of the mma . summarizing present status of non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy of the cmb for low multipoles @xmath10 , we may say that the origin of these peculiarities still is uncertain .",
    "in this paper we go back to the question raised in refs .   and , if the quadrupole is cosmological  ? to answer this question , we will implement the analysis of the ilc(i ) , ilc(iii ) and de oliveira - costa & tegmark ( ref .  )",
    "quadrupole and compare their phases with those of the wmapiii foregrounds : combined maps from the synchrotron , free - free , dust emission at k - w band .",
    "we will show that combination of the ilc(iii ) phases @xmath11 and the foreground phases @xmath12 follow the intriguing relation @xmath13 with accuracy , e.g. within @xmath14 ( rad ) for the foreground at k band . since phases of the signal is closely related to morphology of the maps ( ref .  ) , detected correlation between the ilc(iii ) and foreground phases allow us to conclude that it is most likely due to systematic effects ( such as estimation of the gain factor and foreground separation ) rather then primordial one .",
    "for the statistical characterization of the cmb temperature anisotropies on a sphere where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are polar and azimuthal angle of the polar system of coordinate , it is useful to express @xmath17 in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the amplitudes and phases of the coefficients @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath17 can be full - sky signal , such as the frequency maps from k to w band .",
    "we denote for the ilc and the foreground coefficients as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding phases and the index @xmath28 marks the frequency band for k , ka , q , v and w bands , respectively . in standard cosmological models ( i.e. those involving the simplest forms of inflation )",
    "these temperature fluctuations constitute a realization of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field .",
    "the statistical properties of gaussian random fields are completely determined by the power spectrum @xmath29 where the angle brackets indicate ensemble average . for any single realization of signal ,",
    "the angular power spectrum is estimated @xmath30 as the signal is always real , the conjugate properties of the spherical harmonic coefficients allow us to write down the angular power spectrum as @xmath31      to investigate different correlation of phases for different signals ( the cmb and foregrounds ) we need to implement as much as possible methods to detect corresponding correlations and then to show their possible sources .",
    "one of the possible method is to draw different linear combination of the phases in form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the phases of different signals @xmath36 .",
    "the basis of this method has simple motivation from the analysis of the non - gaussian random process recently performed in refs .   and . if non - linearity of the random process @xmath37 , which leads to its non - gaussianity has simple quadratic form , the standard method of the correlation analysis is the bispectrum .",
    "it is defined as fourier transform of the tree - point correlation function @xmath38 generally speaking for any non - gaussian processes we need to know all high order cross - correlations or polyspectra , which are negligible for the gaussian random process .",
    "however , we may characterize this sort of non - gaussianity in terms of phase correlation",
    ". for process characterized by the bispectrum only , corresponding equation for the phase coupling , which maximizes the bispectrum , has a form ( refs .  , )",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fourier phase of the random process @xmath37 .    as one can see from eq.([eq3 ] ) , linear combination of the phases characterizes non - linear coupling of the modes tested by bispectrum or in general case by polyspectrum .",
    "this is the reason why we introduce the functional @xmath41 to investigate different high order moments of the cmb - foreground cross - correlation .",
    "let us discuss the properties of the second term in eq.([pow ] ) .",
    "this part of the power spectrum is invariant under the following transformation @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the permutation operator for @xmath45 . for the quadrupole component",
    "@xmath46 i.e. this operator simply exchanges @xmath47 and 2 without altering the power spectrum @xmath48 .",
    "however , the map after such implementation of the operator @xmath44 @xmath49 is not invariant . as one can see from eq.([per ] ) , the phases of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 coefficients correspond to the following equations : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "what is important is that if @xmath54 constitute a gaussian random field the phases @xmath26 should have no correlation with the foreground phases @xmath55 , which should also be the case for the @xmath56 as well . in fig.[figd ] we plot the ilc(i ) quadrupole in galactic coordinates and the corresponding transformed map by the permutation operator @xmath44 , which have the same quadrupole power .",
    "below we examine the phases of the ilc and those of the foregrounds in more detail .",
    "firstly , we plot the phases for the ilc(i ) and the foreground and the frequency maps from wmapi in fig.[fig1 ] . the phases for foregrounds at q and v band and for frequency map at q - w to show that @xmath57 ( see errors in the table 1 ) .",
    "for k and ka foregrounds the correlation are even stronger than for q band .    as one",
    "can see from table [ pdiffi ] , the phase of the ilc(i ) @xmath0 is extremely close to the phase of the foreground @xmath2 while the phase difference @xmath58 is close to @xmath59 . to specify the probability of such realization of the phases from uniformly distributed and non - correlated cmb phases with the foregrounds ,",
    "we can use two vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the ilc(i ) and @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the foregrounds .",
    ".the phase difference at @xmath64 and @xmath65 mode between the ilc(i ) and the wmapi foregrounds at q , v and w band ( left 3 columns ) and the wmapi frequency bands ( right 3 columns ) . [ cols=\"^,>,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us discuss another important correlations of the ilc(iii ) phases and the phases of non - cosmological and `` cosmological '' dipoles shown in fig.[fig0 ] . by dipole phase",
    "we mean the phase of @xmath66 mode .",
    "the angle between @xmath67 and the non - cosmological dipole @xmath68 is about @xmath69 radians , while the angle between @xmath70 and the phase of cosmological dipole @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 rad for the ilc(iii ) .",
    "we would like to point out that the above - mentioned correlations between the phases of the ilc(iii ) and those of the wmapiii foregrounds are mainly related to the changes of the gain factor .",
    "the crucial part of these correlations is the angle between @xmath74 and for the foreground phases @xmath75 .",
    "note that transition from the wmapi to wmapiii leads to rotation of the phases for the ilc and for the foregrounds as well .",
    "since wmapiii data seem more accurate in terms of systematic effect removal , decreasing of direct correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , typical for the wmapi , reveals another type of correlation between the ilc(iii ) and the foregrounds . in particular , in addition to eq.([vic ] ) one can get @xmath76 which means that the phases for the ilc(i ) and ilc(iii ) have some regular changes .",
    "it is quite possible that these changes reflect some correlations between the ilc(i ) phases and the wmapi foregrounds .",
    "the comparison between synchrotron phases for the k band shows that from eq.([ww ] ) one can obtain @xmath77 radians , while @xmath78 radians .",
    "so , with accuracy about @xmath79 radian we get : @xmath80 . on the other hand , from eq.([ww ] ) one can get @xmath81 .",
    "finally , combining these two equations we get : @xmath82 as for the wmapiii , one can see that the phases of the ilc(i ) and the wmapi foregrounds per k band are strongly coupled in the form of eq.([ww1 ] ) .",
    "however , note that the eq.([ww1 ] ) , like the eq.([vic ] ) , is `` empirical '' , displaying possible relationship between the phases of the ilc and the foregrounds , which requires explanation in the framework of the cmb and foreground separation scheme .",
    "implemented in this section phase approach can be reformulate in terms of standard correlation between different components of quadrupoles .",
    "since the quadrupole component of the signals ( the cmb and the foregrounds ) contain only @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the coefficient of the cross - correlation between them is simply @xmath85 even if the ilc quadrupole is of gaussian nature , for a single realization of the random process , as our universe does , this cross - correlation coefficients are not informative apart from some peculiar values such as 0 or 1 .",
    "however , combining the coefficient @xmath86 with the same coefficient @xmath87 , defined for the wmap foregrounds by simple comparison between these two numbers we can conclude about common morphology of these signals .      as is mentioned in introduction , starting from the cobe experiment , the properties of the cmb quadrupole and particularly , the deficit of its power in comparison with the best - fit @xmath88cdm cosmological model has attraction of serious attention .",
    "described in the previous section , phase correlation between the ilc and foregrounds contain important information beyond the power spectrum , providing significant restrictions on modification of the theories of inflation . from our analysis",
    "it is clear that models of inflation based on primordial gaussian fluctuations of the inflaton field can not explain the phase correlations .",
    "moreover , the question is if these cross - correlations can be explained in the framework of widely discussed the bianchi viih anisotropic cosmological model ( see , e.g. refs .  , ) as this model predicts specific properties of the phases for the cmb quadrupole  ? to answer this question we extract the quadrupoles of the maps derived in refs .   and . in fig.[bian ] we plot both cmb maps for the range of multipoles @xmath7 and their corresponding quadrupole components .",
    "it can be seen clearly that morphology of these quadrupoles is different from that of the ilc(iii ) quadrupole ( see fig.[figd ] ) .    to characterize this difference , in fig.[ph ] we plot the phase diagram for the quadrupole modes of the ilc(iii ) and those from the above maps .    in spite of differences in phases between the ilc(iii ) and both bianchi viih quadrupoles",
    ", they have remarkable correlations .",
    "namely , the phase difference for the ilc(iii ) phases is @xmath89 rad , while for ref .",
    "quadrupole it is @xmath90 radians and for bridges et al .",
    "( 2006 ) quadrupole it is @xmath91 radians . as one can see , with error about @xmath92 radians these angles @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the same , which means that by simple rotation of the phases we can get the same morphology of the maps . in particular , by rotation of the ref .",
    "quadrupole phases by the angle @xmath95 radians counter - clockwise and by rotation of bridges et al .",
    "( ref .  )",
    "phases by the angle @xmath96 radians clockwise we get the ilc(iii ) phases with above - mentioned accuracy .    in fig.[bian2 ]",
    "we plot the difference between the bridges et al .",
    "quadrupole ( ref .  )",
    "after rotation of phase by the angle @xmath96 radians and the ilc(iii ) quadrupole .",
    "note that the peak to peak amplitude of the maps shown in fig.[bian2 ] are at the same range as the ilc(iii ) quadrupole : at @xmath97k .",
    "that means that in spite of correction of the phases for bridges et al .",
    "quadrupole ( ref .  ) , the amplitudes of @xmath98 modes still are not optimal in comparison with the ilc(iii ) amplitudes .",
    "we have presented the phase analysis of the ilc(i ) , ilc(iii ) and de oliveira - costa and tegmark ( ref .  )",
    "quadrupoles in comparison with the foreground phases .",
    "we have shown that the ilc(iii ) quadrupole has strong correlation with the foreground phases , mainly with the synchrotron emission per k and ka band foregrounds .",
    "we have checked out the possibility that the wmap third year data release quadrupole can be explained by implementation of the biachi viih model discussed in refs .   and .",
    "all these models need additional corrections of the phases for @xmath83 and @xmath84 components in order to math the phases of the ilc(iii ) . by analysis of the de oliveira - costa and tegmark ( ref .  )",
    "quadrupoles related with a different galactic mask we can conclude that detected above correlations between the ilc and foregrounds weakly depend on the type of the mask , if the area covered by them is small in comparison with the @xmath99 . we have shown that transition from the ilc(i ) quadrupole to the ilc(iii ) changes significantly the properties of the cmb - foreground phase correlations through renormalization of the gain factor .",
    "we believe that this is the main reason for discussed above phase correlation , clearly demonstrated importance of accurate removal of the systematic effects .",
