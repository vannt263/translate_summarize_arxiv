    "there has been considerable recent interest on the general dynamics of the glass transitions in bulk polymer systems@xcite .",

    "the vft thermal activation law is quite similar to the well known arrhenius@xcite thermal activation law except for the temperature singularity in the denominator on the right hand side of eq.([intro1 ] ) .",
    "the singularity occurs at a dynamical temperature @xmath2 which is somewhat lower than the thermodynamic glass transition temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the singularity is thereby never quite attained .",
    "nevertheless , the critical slowing down of the vft eq.([intro1 ] ) is experimentally well obeyed in bulk polymer glasses . there",
    "exist somewhat different physical views@xcite as to why the vft law might theoretically be true .",

    "our purpose is to derive the vft thermal law through the following quite simple quantum mechanical considerations .",
    "the transition rate per unit time for an activated process involves an absolute squared transition amplitude ( matrix element ) times a density of final states .",

    "the theoretical problem is to deduce the nature of the excitations@xcite and compute the entropy of activation from the the logarithm of the final state phase space magnitude @xmath7    the polymer glass excitation configurations@xcite pictured in fig.[fig1 ] are of two types : ( i ) there are - in the bulk of the polymer - closed chains of atoms referred to as _ closed _ strings .",
    "( ii ) also , there are open polymer chains which begin and end on the boundary surfaces of the bulk polymer and are referred to as _ open _ strings .",
    "it will be shown below that the closed strings have an entropy obeying the vft thermal activation eq.([intro1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the open string configurations with end points in the neighbourhood of surface boundaries obey shifted thermal activation laws .",
    "the distinction between the thermal activation properties of open and closed strings is crucial for an understanding of surface effects which are of importance for thin films@xcite .",
    "the vft thermal activation law holds only for the bulk polymer . by contrast",
    ", the dynamical sinularity temperature @xmath2 decreases as the ratio of boundary surface are to the bulk volume , @xmath8 , increases .",
    "consequently , the singularity temperature is sharply lowered@xcite when @xmath9 is decreased to a few nanometers .",

    "the configuration counting is mapped into the self avoiding polygon problem .",
    "the activation energy @xmath18 per link determining the chain mobility also determines the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical vft law .",
    "the critical indices employed are calculated as in flory s theory .",
    "the chain movements also lend strong support to `` co - operative '' motion inside the bulk .",
    "it is also to be stressed that the dynamical glass transition temperature , @xmath42 , varies with the distance from the surface boundary through that a coherence length scale of about a few nanometers .",
    "this surface effect is due to the fact polymer strings localized near the surface boundary are more mobile than the polymer chains embedded in the bulk . for sufficiently thin films ,",
