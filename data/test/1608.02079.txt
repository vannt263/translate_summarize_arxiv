    "the era of gravitational wave astronomy has begun with the first science run of the recently upgraded ligo from 2015 september to 2016 january @xcite . the gw frequency range that ligo and virgo are sensitive to",
    "is expected to be dominated by mergers of compact stellar - mass objects that are most likely remnants of stellar evolution : two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) , two black holes ( bh - bh ) , or a ns and a bh . on 2015",
    "september 14 at 09:50:45 utc the ligo collaboration detected the first gw event  gw150914 .",
    "the trigger was determined to be consistent with a waveform predicted by general relativity from the inspiral and merger of two stellar - mass bhs , with masses around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a tentative detection of a weak transient gamma - ray source gw150914-gbm lasting about 1 s , 0.4 s after the ligo trigger on gw150914 .",
    "gw150914-gbm is consistent with being due to a low - fluence short gamma - ray burst ( grb ) at an unfavorable viewing geometry to the gbm detectors , which is not expected from a bh- bh merger .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent luminosity of gw150914-gbm in the 1 kev to 10 mev energy range was @xmath4 using a @xmath5 mpc distance inferred from the gw150914 event .",
    "gw150914 was outside of the field of view of the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) initially and no gev afterglow was detected when it could observe @xcite .",
    "as the ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) usually have a better sensitivity than fermi / lat , we here study whether the tev emission from the gw events could be detected by future iacts , such as the planned cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) .",
    "it has been argued that cta is well suited to follow up gw transients @xcite .",
    "the short grb possibly associated with gw150914 should be produced by a wide - angle outflow , since the chance of detection would be too low if it is a strongly beamed jet .",
    "the outflow producing this short grb must be highly relativistic .",
    "it has been suggested that an accretion disk may exist around one of the bhs via the formation of the dead zone @xcite in a bh - bh merger system .",
    "this system could then also have sub - relativistic or mildly relativistic wind outflow if the disk produce a wind outflow @xcite .    for the ns - ns mergers or ns - bh merges , significant wide - angle mass outflows",
    "are also expected , as have been seen in the numerical simulations .",
    "the mass of the outflow is in the range of @xmath6 with a velocity of @xmath7 . for ns - bh mergers",
    ", the ejecta mass can be up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the mass may have a higher speed or become relativistic with a lorentz factor @xmath9 and energy about @xmath10 for ns - ns mergers or @xmath11 for ns - bh mergers ( nakar & piran 2011 ) . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the expected high - energy gamma - ray emission produced by the blast waves driven by these wide - angle outflows .",
    "the high - energy gamma - ray emission from the small - angle , relativistic jets has been calculated in literatures @xcite .",
    "we here study the tev emission from the wide - angle , mildly - relativistic outflows . compared with the small - angle jets ,",
    "the wide - angle geometry can significantly increase the probability for the follow - up electromagnetic detections of gw transients .",
    "we present the calculation of the self inverse - compton ( ic ) emission for both relativistic and mildly - relativistic outflows in  2 . in  3 ,",
    "we apply the result to both the bh - bh merger and ns - ns ( and ns - bh ) merger scenarios .",
    "finally , we give our discussions and conclusions .",
    "the short grb possibly associated with gw150914 , if real , should be produced by a highly relativistic , wide - angle outflow .",
    "the calculation for relativistic wide - angle outflow is quite similar to the case of grb jets except that the outflow may have a much wider opening angle .",
    "we assume the relativistic outflow has an initial lorentz factor @xmath12 and it interacts with homogenous ambient medium with a number density of @xmath13 .",
    "then the blast wave driven by the outflow starts to decelerate at a time @xmath14 and becomes non - relativistic at a time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy of the blast wave .    for the ns - ns",
    "/ ns - bh mergers , numerical simulations show wide - angle outflows with mass @xmath17 and typical velocity @xmath18 . some works ( e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) suggest the inner part of the outflow can be accelerated up to relativistic velocities if the compact binaries form an accretion disk before the coalescence .",
    "we assume that the mildly - relativistic ejecta with @xmath19 have an energy of about @xmath20 .",
    "such amount of energy is consistent with the non - detection of the late - time radio emission in some compact binary mergers @xcite .",
    "for the mildly - relativistic outflow , the peak of the ic emission occurs at the deceleration time , which is @xmath21 .",
    "tev emission is mainly produced by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the typical spectral breaks in the ssc spectrum are @xcite @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the power - law index of the energy distribution of the injected electrons , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the equipartition factors of magnetic field and electron energy , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two characteristic lorentz factors in the electron energy distribution , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the corresponding break frequencies @xcite .",
    "the optical depth for ic scatterings is @xmath32 for a constant density medium , where @xmath33 is the radius of the blast wave .",
    "then one can obtain the peak flux for the ssc component , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the peak flux of the synchrotron component and @xmath36 is the luminosity distance of the source .",
    "the flux of the ic component is given by @xmath37 at high energies , the ssc spectrum could be affected by the klein - nishina effect @xcite , which occurs at frequencies above a critic frequency of @xmath38 then the flux can be obtained by using eq.50 in @xcite .    to illustrate the tev afterglow behavior ,",
    "we show an example of the light curves at @xmath39 by taking some reference values for the parameters of the wide - angle outflows , which is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the relativistic wide - angle outflow generates a decaying tev afterglow .",
    "meanwhile , the mildly - relativistic outflow and sub - relativistic outflow produce a rising light curve before the deceleration time and a decay one after that . before deceleration , since the blast wave velocity is constant , the typical energy of electrons ( @xmath40 ) and the peak frequency ( @xmath41 ) are constant . as the number of radiating electrons is increasing with time , the inverse - compton tev flux increases with time . after deceleration , as the blast wave velocity decreases , the power of the inverse - compton emission per electron decreases rapidly with time , so the tev flux starts to decrease with time .",
    "our calculations are based on the assumption of the electron distribution of @xmath42 .",
    "a larger @xmath24 may suppress the high energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "this is because the tev band is much larger than the peak frequency of ssc emission @xmath43 and even larger than the cooling frequency @xmath44 in some cases , which makes the ratio between the tev flux and the peak ssc flux affected by the electron distribution .",
    "we first need to estimate the sensitivity of cta .",
    "according to the performance of cta , cta south has a differential sensitivity of @xmath45 at energy of @xmath46 for the @xmath47 exposure . following the method in @xcite",
    ", the sensitivity for an exposure time @xmath48 can be determined by the minimum fluence @xmath49 with which a source is detecable @xcite , i.e. @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the cutoff energy of the energy spectrum , and the constant @xmath52 depends on the width of the energy bin , the flux from the source and the spectral shape of the detector sensitivity .",
    "hereafter , we conservatively assume @xmath53 .    to determine the direction of a gw event , at least two separate gw detectors are needed , taking advantage of the different arrival time of the gw signals at different locations ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on the results of @xcite , @xcite estimated the typical localization sky area for ligo hanford and ligo livingstone network to be @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the inverse error function at certain confidence level ( cl ) and we normally choose a confidence level of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for the three detector case , the localization sky area could be reduced to @xmath58 or even better(@xmath59 ) at some special locations . for the medium energy range of cta , from @xmath60 to @xmath61",
    ", cta has 40 telescopes with a field - of - view of about @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , cta can cover the required area determined by three ( or more ) gw detectors with only 1 - 3 follow - up observation(s ) . according to @xcite , we find that the sensitivity in the survey mode is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the single - pointing detection threshold of cta .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath65 as the tev sensitivity of cta approximately .    as cta can slew to a certain position within 100 seconds",
    ", it can observe the early stage of the tev afterglow if the gw transient is localized , for example , by a short grb .",
    "for the mildly - relativistic outflow case , even if the spatial error is as large as @xmath66 , cta can cover the error in the survey model with a few consecutive observations .",
    "the sensitivity light curve of cta in the point observation mode is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the cta limit observation time is @xmath67 because of observing strategies , so we fix the sensitivity when @xmath68 .",
    "the possible short grb associated with gw150914 suggests that bh - bh mergers may produce wide - angle , relativistic outflows with an isotropic energy of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we study the conditions under which the tev afterglow from this relativistic outflow can be detected by cta .",
    "fig.2 shows the tev flux as a function of the density @xmath13 and the magnetic field equipartition factor @xmath27 , as these two parameters are the mostly unknown parameters .",
    "the distance of the source is taken as @xmath70 , comparable to the distance of gw150914 @xcite .",
    "since the tev light curves show a decaying feature ( fig.1 ) , the time at which cta starts observation , @xmath71 , is important for tev detection .",
    "a conservative observational delay of @xmath72 can be obtained because of a 1-minute delay from data analysis / detection and  1/2 minute delay from the maneuver of cta @xcite .",
    "we show how the value of @xmath71 affects cta detection by choosing two values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , as shown respectively by the left and right panel of fig.2 .",
    "we find that the tev afterglow emission for the case of @xmath75 can be detected by cta when @xmath76 for @xmath77 , while for the case of @xmath78 , @xmath79 is needed .",
    "the mergers of ns - ns or ns - bh binaries are promising sources for gravitational detection by aligo and avirgo .",
    "short grbs , resulted from highly relativistic jets , are believed to be produced by such systems .",
    "as the opening angle of the relativistic jets are usually small , perhaps of @xmath80 , the jet direction only covers a very small fraction of the sky .",
    "here we pay attention to the wide - angle outflow from ns - ns ( ns - bh ) mergers .",
    "numerical simulations of compact binary merger systems have been carried out by many groups ( e.g. ) .",
    "the mergers give rise to unbound matter ejection through dynamic processes .",
    "the mass ejected depends primarily on the total binary mass , the mass ratio and the equation of state . in some simulations",
    ", disk formation can contribute to several outflow sources .",
    "for example , neutrino heating drives a wind from the disk surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outflow velocity may become relativistic for winds that are ejected from close to the central object .",
    "thus , similar to @xcite , we assume that a fraction of the mass becomes relativistic with a lorentz factor of @xmath81 and energy about @xmath10 for ns - ns mergers or @xmath82 for ns - bh mergers .",
    "if the central object after the merger of double nss is a fast - rotating magnetar , the energy in the mildly - relativistic ejecta would be even larger   @xcite .",
    "we calculate the tev afterglow emission at the deceleration time of the mildly - relativistic outflow , which is shown in fig.3 . in this case",
    ", the light curve reaches a peak at the time @xmath83 .",
    "the duration of the peak lasts several days , so cta can scan the whole error box of the gw transient in this period . according to fig.3",
    ", the detection of a ns - bh merger at @xmath84 by cta requires that the density should be @xmath85 for a wide range of @xmath27 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "such a high density is possible if the merger occurs in the disk of starburst galaxies .",
    "we note that some short grbs have been found to occur in such star - forming galaxies .",
    "detection of tev afterglow would strongly support that mergers indeed occur in the star - forming regions .",
    "we considered the tev afterglow emission from the wide - angle , relativistic outflow of bh - bh mergers and from the mildly - relativistic outflow of ns - ns / ns - bh mergers .",
    "we found that tev afterglow emission could be detected if the compact binary mergers occur in a dense ambient environment(i.e .",
    ", @xmath87 for gw150914-like binary bh mergers and @xmath88 for ns - ns / ns - bh mergers ) . for the binary black - hole merger gw150914",
    ", it has been suggested that the binary black - holes formation involves either isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical interactions in young and old dense stellar environments @xcite .",
    "the binary black - hole progenitor of gw150914 could have formed in the local universe with a short merger delay time , or it could have formed at a higher redshift with a long merger delay time . in the short - delay merger scenario ,",
    "the mergers are expected to occur in the star - forming regions , so the ambient medium density is high .",
    "detections of tev afterglow emission by cta in future would support the short - delay merger scenario for gw events like gw150914 .    for the evolution of ns - ns or ns - bh binaries , short grb observations",
    "have shed some light on the burst environment .",
    "short grbs occur in both elliptical and star - forming galaxies , with the latter accounting for about @xmath89 of the sample ( berger 2014 ) . for mergers occurring in dense star - forming regions with a high gas density",
    ", tev afterglow emission could be detected by cta .",
    "if a magnetar forms after the merger of double nss , the chance of detection of tev afterglow would be increased as the energy in the mildly - relativistic outflow is increased by the injection energy from the central magnetar .",
    "the mildly - relativistic ejecta resulted from ns - ns or ns - bh mergers will also produce a long term radio emission due to its interaction with the surrounding ism .",
    "recently , @xcite search for such emission from two short grbs , i.e. grb 130603b and grb 060614 , with radio telescopes , but find non - detections .",
    "the upper limit flux of the radio emission can nevertheless put useful constraints on the parameters of the ejecta and density of the surrounding medium . to study the constraints",
    ", we calculate the radio emissions at 6.7 ghz from the mildly - relativistic ejecta with different parameters adopted , which are shown in fig.4 .",
    "we find that the radio emission violates the upper limits only when both the ism density is higher than @xmath90 and the ejecta energy is higher than @xmath91",
    ". therefore , a wide parameter space still exists for which tev afterglow could be detected by cta while meanwhile the radio constraints are satisfied .",
