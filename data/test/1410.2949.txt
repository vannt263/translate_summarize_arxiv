    "real networks contain unreliable components ; in critical infrastructures and technological networks some links may become non - operational owing to disasters or accidents , and in natural networks this might occur owing to pathologies . although the robustness and resilience of networks have been extensively investigated over the past decade @xcite , controllability methods for complex networks that can robustly manage structural changes have not been developed .",
    "the existing research is limited to recent studies of network controllability under node attack and cascading failures using maximum matching @xcite , the discussion of quantitative measures of network robustness to investigate the effect of edge removal on the number of controllable nodes without a comprehensive theoretical analysis @xcite and studies on multi - agent systems under simultaneous failure of links and agents @xcite .",
    "note that the problem of how the number of driver nodes change as function of removal fraction of edges @xcite and our question of how to design complex networks with structurally robust control feature are drastically different . while the former are heavily relying on percolation and cascading failure techniques well - studied over the past decade",
    ", our work studies the minimum number of driver nodes to control the entire network against arbitrary single or multiple edge failures .    here",
    ", we introduce the concept of structurally robust control of complex networks . to provide a concrete example ,",
    "we adopt the minimum dominating set ( mds ) model because it has been widely applied to the control of engineering systems , such as mobile ad hoc networks ( manet ) , transportation routing , computer communication networks @xcite , design of swapped networks for constructing large parallel and distributed systems @xcite as well as the investigation of social influence propagation @xcite .",
    "robust control theory emerged in the late 1970s and is based on linear , time - invariant transfer functions .",
    "the controller is designed to change the system s model dynamics until it reaches a certain degree of uncertainty or disturbance .",
    "thus , the system is designed to be robust or stable against the presence of bounded modelling errors . to address disturbances , techniques such as single - input",
    ", single - output ( siso ) feedback and h - infinity loop - shaping were developed to avoid dynamic trajectories that deviate when disturbances enter the system @xcite .",
    "although modern robust control engineering has been successfully applied to numerous real - world problems , such as stability in aircrafts and satellites and the efficiency of power , manufacturing , and chemical plants , it has not yet been applied to the problem of structural changes on a large network .",
    "a set of nodes @xmath0 in a graph @xmath1 is a dominating set ( ds ) if every node in @xmath1 is either an element of @xmath0 or adjacent to an element of @xmath0 .",
    "then , the mds approach states that a network is made structurally controllable by selecting an mds ( driver set ) because each dominated node has its own control signal @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schema]a ) .",
    "recently , molnr et al . further studied the size of an mds by exhaustively comparing several types of artificial scale - free networks using a greedy algorithm @xcite .",
    "interestingly , wuchty demonstrated the applicability of the mds approach @xcite to the controllability of protein interaction networks and showed that the minimum dominating set of proteins were enriched with essential , cancer - related and virus - targeted genes @xcite . whereas each element is controlled by at least one node in @xmath1 ( @xmath2=1 ) ( or is covered by itself ) in an mds , the novel robust mds ( rmds ) approach states that each node must be covered by itself or at least two nodes in @xmath1 ( @xmath2=2 ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schema]cd ) .",
    "the analytical results and computer simulations demonstrate that a robust configuration ( @xmath2=2 , @xmath3=2 ) and non - robust configuration ( @xmath2=1 , @xmath3=1 ) of a scale - free network with minimum degree @xmath3 require the same order of driver nodes .",
    "the robust configuration guarantees that the system remains controllable even under arbitrary single or multiple link failure .",
    "this finding has remarkable implications for designing technical and natural systems that can still operate in the presence of unavailable or damaged links because the implementation of such a robust system in a large network does not change the order of the required controllers in a conventional system without robustness capability . as a byproduct of this research",
    ", our results also demonstrate that the minimum degree @xmath3 in a network plays an important role in network controllability and significantly affects the size of the mds . in particular , for @xmath4 , the order of the size of an mds changes if the minimum degree changes , unveiling another tool to reduce the number of driver nodes .",
    "these theoretical findings are confirmed by computer simulations and an analysis of real - world undirected , directed and bipartite networks .",
    "in addition , the mds approach is extended to address probabilistic network domination when we consider the probability of link transmission failure .",

    "( a ) the network is structurally controllable by selecting a minimum dominating set ( mds ) because each dominated node has its own control signal .",
    "a maximum matching approach needs three driver nodes @xmath5,@xmath6 , and @xmath7 , assuming a matching link from @xmath5 to @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , the mds only requires one node , @xmath5 .",
    "the labels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate control .",
    "( b ) example of a dominating set ( ds ) in a graph @xmath1 .",
    "a set of nodes @xmath0 ( filled ) in a graph @xmath1 is a dominating set if every node in @xmath1 is either an element of @xmath0 or adjacent to an element of @xmath0 .",
    "( c ) the graph @xmath1 allows for an mds with cover @xmath2=1 composed of only three nodes .",

    "( e ) each edge ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) has a failure probability of @xmath14 highlighted in the figure . in a probabilistic minimum dominating set ( pmds ) , the approach shown here , each node",
    "must be covered by multiple nodes in the mds so that the probability that at least one edge is active is at least @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , @xmath16 must cover itself because the link ( @xmath17 ) is unreliable with a failure probability of 0.8 , which is higher than @xmath15 . ]",
    "the concept of structural controllability was first introduced by lin @xcite for single - input systems and it was quickly extended to multi - input systems @xcite . the maximum matching ( mm ) algorithm identifies the minimum number of nodes to control the entire network , by providing a mapping between structural controllability and network structure @xcite .",
    "however , there are several striking differences with mds approach : ( 1 ) by using mm approach , the fraction of driver nodes tends to be minimized in random networks .",
    "the mds does not necessarily give a minimum number of driver nodes in the sense of mm approach .",
    "however , mds gives less number of driver nodes in many cases , including scale - free networks in which hubs are present @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the star graph ( all nodes but one node are leaves ) with @xmath18 leaves .",
    "then , mm approach needs @xmath18 - 1 driver nodes whereas mds approach needs only one driver node .",
    "( 2 ) the mm approach is based on linear systems whereas mds approach does not even need structural controllability : it is enough to assume that a node is controllable if it is directly connected to a driver node .",
    "this represents one of the unique features of the mds model because it suggests that can be applied to a certain kind of nonlinear and/or discrete models .",
    "however , these striking advantages have a price . ( 1 ) the set of driver nodes in mds is @xmath19 in scale - free networks with @xmath20 . ( 2 )",
    "each edge has to be controlled independently . however , even in the case of @xmath19 , a relatively small number of drivers is required in most cases .",
    "above all , the proposed concept of structurally robust control is an algorithmic - independent framework .",
    "therefore , engineering applications of structurally robust control may flexibly give preference to one algorithm over another .",
    "in the following , we present analytically derived predictions for the minimum number of drivers using the mds controllability approach by considering specific cases for the degree exponent @xmath22 and the minimum degree @xmath3",
    ". then , the robust control is also analysed by considering the number of drivers @xmath2 required to cover each node .",
    "we first assume that the minimum degree of an undirected graph @xmath23 with @xmath18 nodes and a degree distribution that follows a power - law @xmath24 is @xmath3 .",
    "we then use a standard mean - field approach that assumes a continuum approximation for the degree @xmath25 , so that it becomes a continuous real variable @xcite .",
    "we also note that there are some discussions on degree cut - off @xcite because our analysis assumes that there exist high - degree nodes .",
    "however , we do not introduce such degree cut - off because we are performing a kind of mean - field analysis .",
    "it is to be noted that scale - free networks are a kind of random networks and thus we can have a node with even degree @xmath26 with very small probability if @xmath27 @xcite . in the mean - field analysis ,",
    "such rare cases are taken into account .",
    "however , discussions of degree cut - off are based on average case analysis , and there does not exist a consensus cut - off value .",
    "therefore , we do not introduce degree cut - off in our analysis .",
    "the results of computer simulation support that our analysis is appropriate . note also that each node with degree more than 1 must be covered by @xmath2 nodes ( not by @xmath2 edges ) in our ilp formulation and thus the effect of multiple edges is eliminated in computer simulation . as it has been shown in the field of complex network science",
    ", the analysis and classification of networks in terms of their degree distribution is a key feature to understand the complex behavior of complex systems . in particular",
    ", the scale - free topology fundamentally changes the system s behavior , with broad implications from spreading processes on networks ( like for example the spread of infectious diseases ) to cascading failures @xcite .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to examine the controllability problem in networks governed by power - law degree distributions .",
    "first we assume that the minimum degree @xmath3 is 2 in an undirected graph @xmath23 , where @xmath28 is a set of @xmath18 nodes , and @xmath29 is a set of edges connecting nodes in @xmath28 . from the following equation : @xmath30 we have @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the set of nodes with degree between @xmath33 and @xmath18 .",
    "then , the number of nodes in @xmath32 ( denoted by @xmath34 ) is @xmath35_{n^{\\beta}}^{n }   = - 2^{\\gamma-1 } n \\cdot \\left ( n^{1-\\gamma } - n^{\\beta(1-\\gamma ) } \\right )   \\approx   2^{\\gamma-1 } n^{1+\\beta(1-\\gamma)}.\\ ] ]    let @xmath36 be the number of edges in @xmath23 .",
    "then , @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where the factor 2 in @xmath38 comes from the fact that each edge is counted by two nodes .",
    "the number of edges that are connected to at least one node in @xmath32 ( i.e. , the number of edges covered by @xmath32 ) is lower bounded by @xmath39 it should be noted that @xmath40 gives a lower bound and the number of edges covered by @xmath32 may be much larger because this estimate considers the case where both endpoints of these edges are in @xmath32 .",
    "the probability that an arbitrary edge is not covered by @xmath32 is upper bounded by @xmath41 then , the probability that a node with degree @xmath25 does not have any edge connected to @xmath32 is upper bounded by @xmath42 which is also upper bounded by @xmath43 because the minimum degree is assumed to be 2 .",
    "therefore , the number of nodes ( denoted by @xmath44 ) not covered by @xmath32 is @xmath45 since we can have a dominating set if we merge these nodes with @xmath32 , the number of nodes in an mds is upper bounded by @xmath46 . to minimize the order of @xmath47 .",
    "we let @xmath48 which results in @xmath49 by using this @xmath50 , an upper bound of the size of an mds is estimated as @xmath51    we can see that this order is smaller than that of our previous result on @xmath3=1 @xcite @xmath52 in particular , the above takes the minimum order @xmath53 when @xmath54 for @xmath3=1 whereas the new bound for @xmath3=2 takes the minimum order @xmath55 when @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "this difference comes from the fact that a node @xmath57 is regarded as not covered by @xmath32 if one specific edge connected to @xmath57 is not covered by @xmath32 in an existing analysis @xcite whereas a node @xmath57 is regarded as not covered by @xmath32 if no edge connected to @xmath57 is not covered by @xmath32 in this analysis .",
    "we can extend the above result for the case where the minimum degree is @xmath3 , by replacing @xmath58 with @xmath59 then , we have @xmath60 by using this @xmath50 , an upper bound of the size of mds is estimated as @xmath61 this order of the mds size that scales as @xmath62 takes the minimum value when @xmath63 it is to be noted that although @xmath64 depends on @xmath3 , it does not affect the order of the mds size .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath65 for the order of the mds size is shown as a function of the degree exponent @xmath22 in fig .",
    "this is our first main result and demonstrates that for scale - free networks with @xmath21 , the order of the mds size changes ( the exponent @xmath65 changes in functional form of @xmath62 ) when the minimum degree increases .",
    "the dependence of the degree exponent @xmath66 that minimises the mds size on the minimum degree @xmath3 is also shown in fig . 2c .",
    "the results demonstrate that a higher minimum degree makes it easier to control scale - free networks with @xmath21 ( fig .",

    "next , we show the results for the robust domination ( rmds ) ( fig .",
    "for an undirected graph @xmath23 and a positive integer @xmath2 , @xmath67 is called a @xmath2-robust dominating set if each node @xmath68 satisfies the following : either @xmath69 or @xmath57 is connected to @xmath2 or more nodes in @xmath70 . here",
    ", we provide an upper bound of the size of the minimum @xmath2-robust dominating set .",
    "note that an rds is a special case of a generalized dominating set @xcite , which has been studied in the context of the computational complexity .",
    "however , it has not been investigated from the perspective of complex networks .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath2-robust domination in which the minimum degree of @xmath23 is @xmath3 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants such that @xmath71 .    as in section ii.a ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the set of nodes with degree between @xmath33 and @xmath18 .",
    "then , the probability that a node is not covered by @xmath2 or more nodes in @xmath32 is bounded by @xmath72 where we do not include the factor of @xmath73 because we consider an upper bound .",
    "this number is further bounded by @xmath74 for sufficiently large @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the number of nodes not covered by @xmath32 is @xmath75 where we let @xmath76 .",
    "it is to be noted that a constant factor is ignored here because we use @xmath77-notation .",
    "as before , by balancing the size of @xmath32 and the number of non - covered nodes , we have @xmath78 by using this @xmath50 , an upper bound of the size of rmds is estimated as @xmath79    this is our second and most important finding .",
    "this result suggests that the case of an rmds with minimum cover @xmath2 and minimum degree @xmath3 corresponds to the case of an mds with the minimum degree @xmath80 .",
    "for example , the case of an rmds with @xmath81 ( i.e. , the case where each node ( with a degree of at least 2 ) must be covered twice , and the minimum degree @xmath3 is 2 ) corresponds to the case of an mds with @xmath82 .    in all theoretical analyses in sections ii.a and ii.b , we assume that multi - edges ( i.e. , multiple edges between the same pair of nodes ) are allowed because it is known that there does not exist a network strictly following a power - law distribution with @xmath83 if multi - edges are not allowed @xcite .",
    "however , even if multi - edges between the same pairs are replaced by single edges after generating a power - law network with multi - edges , the results should hold if the cover parameter @xmath2 is 1 because mds is only concerned with existence of an edge from each node not in mds to a node in mds .",
    "if @xmath84 , we need to consider the possibility that some of @xmath2 edges are connected to a node @xmath57 are multi - edges because such @xmath57 may not be dominated by @xmath2 nodes .",
    "we will show that such a factor can be ignored in many cases if we discuss the order of the size of mds .",
    "of course , the resulting network does not strictly follow a power - law distribution if multi - edges are replaced by single edges . however , because any network with @xmath4 can not strictly follow a power - law distribution , our assumption seems reasonable .    here",
    "we note that eqs .",
    "( 4)(5 ) are identical to eqs .",
    "( 1)(2 ) if we replace @xmath29 by @xmath3 .",
    "it suggests that the case of rmds with the minimum cover @xmath2 and the minimum degree @xmath3 corresponds to the case of mds with the minimum degree @xmath80 .",
    "for example , the case of rmds with @xmath81 corresponds to the case of mds with @xmath82 .    in the above",

    "since the number of edges connected to a node of degree @xmath25 in @xmath32 is @xmath85 , there exist @xmath86 nodes of degree @xmath25 in @xmath32 , and there exist @xmath87 edges connected to @xmath32 , the probability that @xmath2 edges contain at least one common endpoint in @xmath32 is @xmath88 since there exist @xmath19 nodes covered by @xmath32 , the number of nodes not covered by @xmath2 different nodes would be @xmath89 if the exponent @xmath90 is smaller than that in eq .",
