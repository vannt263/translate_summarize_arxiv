    "for instance , sans has previously been used for investigating the anisotropy of the structure factor and the relaxation dynamics of magnetic fluids , @xcite the internal structure and morphology of magnetic nanoparticles and nanowire arrays , @xcite the vortex lattice of superconductors , @xcite or the spin distribution of nanocrystalline @xcite and amorphous @xcite metals .",
    "the scattering contrast in magnetic sans arises from deviations of both the magnitude and orientation of the local magnetization vector field @xmath4 from its mean value . the phenomenological continuum theory of micromagnetics @xcite allows one to compute the magnetic microstructure of a material , i.e. , the variation of the direction of @xmath5 as a function of the position @xmath6 and time .",

    "@xcite examples for such materials are nanocrystalline or cold - worked metals which exhibit nanoscale variations in the direction and/or magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy , leading to a highly inhomogeneous spin structure along with a strongly field - dependent magnetic sans signal . as summarized in ref .  ,",
    "analysis of experimental sans data on nanocrystalline cobalt and nickel and on cold - worked coarse - grained nickel yields information on the strength and spatial structure of the magnetic anisotropy field , on the magnitude and field dependence of the magnetostatic field , on the exchange constant , and on the characteristic length of the spin misalignment .",
