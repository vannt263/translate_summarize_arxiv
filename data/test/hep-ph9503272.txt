    "decays of heavy flavours play an important role in the determination of the not yet well explored ckm sektor of the standard model . the weak processes that need to be studied involve transitions among quarks of different flavours ; however , to connect the observed transitions among hadrons to the underlying quark processes one has to deal with the bound state problem of strong interactions .    for the decays of heavy flavours one may take advantage of the fact that the mass @xmath0 of the heavy quark is large compared to the scale @xmath1 , which is determined by the light degrees of freedom and",
    "thus is of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "the amplitudes or the transition rates for the decays of heavy flavoured hadrons are evaluated as an expansion in powers of @xmath3 , the leading term of which corresponds to an infinitely heavy , static quark @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 expansion has been formulated in the laguage of effective field theory , the so called heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite . in this framework",
    "one may systematically access the mass dependence of any matrix element involving heavy hadron states and heavy quark fields .",
    "furthermore , in the infinite mass limit two additional symmetries appear @xcite , which play an important role in the context of exclusive heavy flavour decays .    in the past few years methods",
    "have been developed to apply the @xmath4 expansion also to inclusive decays of heavy hadrons @xcite , and the purpose of this talk is to give a short review of these developments .",
    "it is impossible to cover all topics in the field of inclusive decays due to length and time restrictions and consequently this review can cover only some selected topics",
    ".    for inclusive decays a @xmath4 expansion is obtained for the rates by an approach similar to the one known from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the first step consists of an operator product expansion ( ope ) which yields an infinite sum of operators with increasing dimension .",
    "the dimensions of the operators are compensated by inverse powers of a large scale , which is in general of the order of the heavy mass scale .",
    "the decay probability is then given as forward matrix elements of these operators between the state of the decaying heavy hadron ; these matrix elements still have a mass dependence , which then may be extracted in terms of a @xmath4 expansion using hqet as for exclusive decays .    in section 2",
    "we give a short description of the ope approach to inclusive decays .",
    "section 3 summarizes the results for the total rates , including the first non - trivial non - perturbative corrections . in section 3 the method",
    "is applied to the charged lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic @xmath5 decays .",
    "it turns out that the endpoint region can not be described by a @xmath4 expansion ; rather a partial resummation of the @xmath4 expansion is required , which is closely analogous to the leading twist term in deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "this is summarized in section 4 .",
    "finally , we conclude and point out a few open questions which are currently under study .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for a decay of a heavy ( down - type ) quark is in general linear in the decaying heavy flavoured quark @xmath6 where the operator @xmath7 describes the decay products . in the following",
    "we shall consider semileptonic decays , for which @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an up - type quark ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 , since we shall consider @xmath12 decays ) .",
    "similarly , for nonleptonic decays the cabbibo allowed contribution corresponds to @xmath13 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is a down - type ( up - type ) quark and @xmath16 the corresponding ckm matrix element .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 are the qcd corrections obtained from the renormalization group running between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; in leading logarithmic approximation these coefficients are @xcite @xmath20^{\\gamma_{\\pm } } , \\mbox { with } \\gamma _ + = \\frac{6}{33 - 2n_f}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma _ - , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the onle - loop expression for the running coupling coupling constant of qcd .",
    "finally , for radiative rare decays we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is again a coefficient obtained from running between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "its value is @xmath24 , the corresponding analytical expression may be found in @xcite .",
    "the inclusive decay rate for a heavy hadron @xmath25 containing the quark @xmath26 may be related to a forward matrix element by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the final state which is summed over to obtain the inclusive rate .",
    "the matrix element appearing in ( [ inclusive ] ) contains a large scale , namely the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the first step towards a @xmath4 expansion is to make this large scale explicit",
    ". this may be done by a phase redefinition which leads to @xmath29 where @xmath30 this relation exhibits the similarity between the cross - section calculation in deep inelastic scattering and the present approach to total rates . in deep inelastic scattering",
    "there appears a large scale which is the momentum transfer to the leptons , while here the mass of the heavy quark appears as a large scale .",
    "the next step is to perform an operator product expansion of the product of the two hamitonians . after the phase redefinition",
    "the remaining matrix element does not involve large momenta of the order of the heavy quark mass any more and hence a short - distance expansion becomes useful , if the mass @xmath0 is large compared to the scale @xmath1 determining the matrix element .",
    "the next step is thus to perform an operator - product expansion , which has the general form @xmath31 where @xmath32 are operators of dimension @xmath33 , with their matrix elements renormalized at scale @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "these coefficients encode the short distance physics related to the heavy quark mass scale and may be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "all long distance contributions connected to the hadronic scale @xmath1 are contained in the matrix elements of the operators @xmath36 .",
    "still the matrix elements of @xmath36 are not independent of the heavy quark mass scale , but this mass dependence may be expanded in powers of @xmath4 by means of heavy quark effective theory .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the heavy quark fields appearing in the operators @xmath32 as well as the states by including the corrections to the lagrangian as time - ordered products . in this way",
    "the mass dependence of the total decay rate may be accessed completely within an expansion in @xmath4 .",
    "the lowest - order term of the operator product expansion are the dimension-3 operators . due to lorentz invariance and parity",
    "there are only two combinations which may appear , namely @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "note that the @xmath39 operators differ from the full qcd operators only by a phase redefinition , and hence @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the first combination is proportional to the @xmath26-number current @xmath42 , which is normalized even in full qcd , while the second differs from the first one only by terms of order @xmath43 @xmath44 h_v + { \\cal o } ( 1/m_q^3 ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the gluon field strength .",
    "thus the matrix elements of the dimension-3 contribution is known to be normalized ; in the standard normalization of the states this implies @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass of the heavy hadron .",
    "to lowest order in the heavy mass expansion we may furthermore replace @xmath48 and hence we may evaluate the leading term in the @xmath4 expansion without any hadronic uncertainty .",
    "generically the dimension-3 contribution yields the free quark decay rate .",
    "this has been previously used as a model for inclusive decays , but now it turns out to be the first term in a systematic @xmath4 expansion of total rates .",
    "a dimension-4 operators contains an additional covariant derivative , and thus one has matrix elements of the type @xmath49 since the equations of motion apply for this tree level matrix element , one finds that the constant @xmath50 has to vanish , and thus there are no dimension-4 contributions .",
    "this statement is completely equivalent to lukes theorem @xcite , since we are considering a forward matrix element , i.e. a matrix element at zero recoil @xcite .",
    "the first non - trivial non - perturbative contribution comes from dimension-5 operators and are of order @xmath43 . for mesonic decays",
    "there are only the two parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to matrix elements involving higher order terms that appear in the effective theory lagrangian @xmath53 where the normalization of the states is chosen to be @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mass of the heavy meson in the static limit .",
    "these parameters may be interpreted as the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the heavy quark and its energy due to the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark inside the heavy meson respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is easy to access , since it is related to the mass splitting between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from the @xmath5-meson system",
    "we obtain @xmath58 from the charm system the same value is obtained .",
    "this shows that indeed the spin - symmetry partners are degenerate in the infinite mass limit and the splitting between them scales as @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 appearing is not simply related to the hadron spectrum ; from the definition of @xmath51 one is led to assume @xmath59 ; a more restrictive inequality @xmath60 has been derived in a quantum mechanical framework in @xcite and using heavy - flavour sum rules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exists also a qcd sum rule estimate @xcite for this parameter : @xmath61",
    "in this section we collect the results for the total rates including the first non - trivial non - perturbative correction .    inserting @xmath62 as given in ( [ rsl ] )",
    "one obtains for the total inclusive semileptonic decay rate @xmath63 @xmath64 , \\ ] ] where the two @xmath65 are phase - space functions @xmath66 the result for @xmath67 is obtained from ( [ bcsl ] ) as the limit @xmath68 and the replacement @xmath69 @xmath70    .\\ ] ] as was discussed above , the leading non - perturbative corrections in ( [ bcsl ] ) and ( [ busl ] ) are parametrized by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "estimates for these parameters have been discussed in section 2 ; in order to estimate the total effect of the non - perturbative effects we insert a range of values @xmath71 gev@xmath72 ; from this we obtain @xmath73 this means that the non - perturbative contributions are small , in particular compared to the perturbative ones , which have been calculated some time ago @xcite . for the decay @xmath74 the lowest order qcd corrections are given by @xmath75 = 0.85 |v_{ub}|^2 \\gamma_b,\\ ] ] and thus the typical size of qcd radiative corrections is of the order of ten to twenty percent .    similarly , one obtains the result for non - leptonic decays as @xmath76          - 48 a_2 f_3 \\left(\\frac{m_c}{m_b}\\right )            \\frac{1}{2m_b^2 } \\lambda_2 \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath77 are expressed as combination of the wilson coefficents @xmath17 given in ( [ cpm ] ) @xmath78 , \\qquad a_2 = \\frac{1}{6 } [ c_+^2 ( m_b ) - c_-^2 ( m_b ) ] , \\ ] ] and @xmath79 is another phase space function . again",
    "the non - perturbative corrections turn out to be small , in the region of a few percent compared to the leading term , and the perturbative corrections turn out to be much larger than this .    finally , for the rare decay",
    "@xmath80 one may as well calculate the non - perturbative contribution in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "one obtains @xmath81,\\ ] ] and the relative size of the nonperturbative corrections is the same as in the @xmath74 decays .",
    "typically the non - pertubative corrections are much smaller than the radiative corrections .",
    "the only exception is the endpoint region of lepton energy spectra which receives both large perturbative as well as nonperturbative corrections .",
    "however , this is only a small region in phase space and the corrections to the total rates remain moderate .",
    "the method of the operator - product expansion may also be used to obtain the non - perturbative corrections to the charged lepton energy spectrum . in this case the operator product expansion is applied not to the full effective hamiltonian , but rather only to the hadronic currents .",
    "the rate is written as a product of the hadronic and leptonic tensor @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the phase - space differential .",
    "the short - distance expansion is then performed for the two currents appearing in the hadronic tensor . redefining the phase of the heavy - quark fields as in ( [ phaseredef ] ) one finds that the momentum transfer variable relevant for the short - distance expansion is @xmath84 , where @xmath9 is the momentum transfer to the leptons .",
    "the structure of the expansion for the spectrum is identical to the one of the total rate .",
    "the contribution of the dimension-3 operators yields the free - quark decay spectrum , there are no contributions from dimension-4 operators , and the @xmath85 corrections are parametrized in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . calculating the spectrum for @xmath63 yields @xcite @xmath86 ^ 2 } ( 3 r^2 - 4 r^3 )    - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{m_b^2(1-y ) } ( r^2 - 2 r^3 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{3\\lambda_2}{m_b^2(1-y ) } ( 2 r+3 r^2 - 5 r^3 )     + \\frac{\\lambda_1}{3 m_b^2 } [ 5y - 2(3-\\rho ) r^2 + 4 r^3 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left",

    "this expression is somewhat complicated , but it simplifies for the decay @xmath89 since then the mass of the quark in the final state may be neglected .",
    "one finds @xmath90 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    -1.5 cm    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the distributions for inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the spectrum close to the endpoint , where the lepton energy becomes maximal , exhibits a sharp spike as @xmath91 .",
    "in this region we have @xmath92 , \\ ] ] which behaves like @xmath93-functions and its derivatives as @xmath94 , which can be seen in ( [ buspec ] ) .",
    "this behaviour indicates a breakdown of the operator product expansion close to the endpoint , since for the spectra the expansion parameter is not @xmath4 , but rather @xmath95 , which becomes @xmath96)$ ] after the integration over the neutrino momentum . in order to obtain a description of the endpoint region",
    ", one has to perform some resummation of the operator product expansion .",
    "very close to the endpoint of the inclusive semileptonic decay spectra only a few resonances contribute . in this resonance region",
    "one can not expect to have a good description of the spectrum using an approach based on parton - hadron duality ; here a sum over a few resonances will be appropriate .    in the variable @xmath97 the size of this resonance region",
    "is , however , of the order of @xmath98 and thus small . in a larger region of the order @xmath99 , which we shall call the endpoint region , many resonances contribute and one may hope to describe the spectrum in this region using parton - hadron duality .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that the @xmath93-function - like singularities appearing in ( [ buspec ] ) may be reinterpreted as the expansion of a non - perturbative function describing the spectrum in the endpoint region . keeping only the singular terms of ( [ buspec ] ) we write @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a non - perturbative function given in terms of the moments @xmath102 of the spectrum , taken over the endpoint region .",
    "these moments themselves have an expansion in @xmath4 such that @xmath103 , and we shall consider only the leading term in the expansion of the moments , corresponding to the most singular contribution to the endpoint region .    comparing ( [ buspec ] ) with ( [ shape ] ) and ( [ momexp ] ) one obtains that @xmath104 where the integral extends over the endpoint region .",
    "the non - perturbative function implements a resummation of the most singular terms contributing to the endpoint and , in the language of deep inelastic scattering , corresponds to the leading twist contribution . a similar approach based on the parton model",
    "will be described in a separate talk at this conference @xcite .",
    "this resummation has been studied in qcd @xcite and the function @xmath105 may be related to the distribution of the light cone component of the heavy quark residual momentum inside the heavy meson .",
    "the latter is a fundamental function for inclusive heavy - to - light transitions , which has been defined in @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the positive light cone component of the residual momentum @xmath108 .",
    "the relation between the two functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 from which we infer that the @xmath112 moment of the endpoint region is given in terms of the matrix element @xmath113 .",
    "the function @xmath110 is a universal distribution function , which appears in all heavy - to - light inclusive decays ; another example is the decay @xmath80 @xcite , where this function determines the photon - energy spectrum in a region of order @xmath4 around the @xmath114 peak .    in principle",
    "@xmath110 has to be determined by other methods than the @xmath4 expansion , e.g.  from lattice calculations or from a model , or it has to be determined from experiment by measuring the photon spectrum in @xmath80 or the lepton spectrum in @xmath115 . in the context of the model accmm model @xcite @xmath110 has been calculated in  @xcite .    some of the properties of @xmath110 are known .",
    "its support is @xmath116 , it is normalized to unity , and its first moment vanishes .",
    "its second moment is given by @xmath117 , and its third moment has been estimated @xcite . a one - parameter model for @xmath110 has been suggested in @xcite , which incorporates the known features of @xmath110 @xmath118 where @xmath119 , and the choice @xmath120 mev yields reasonable values for the moments . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the spectrum for @xmath67 using the ansatz ( [ ftoy ] ) .",
    "-3 mm    including the non - perturbative effects yields a reasonably behaved spectrum in the endpoint region and the @xmath93-function - like singularities have disappeared .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum now extends beyond the parton model endpoint ; it is shifted from @xmath121 to the physical endpoint @xmath122 , since @xmath110 is non - vanishing for positive values of @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath4 expansion obtained from the ope and hqet offers the unique possibility to calculate the transition rates for inclusive decays in a qcd based and model independent framework .",
    "the leading term of this expansion is always the free quark decay , and the first non - trivial corrections are in general given by the mean kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside the heavy hadron @xmath51 and the matrix element @xmath52 of the chromomagnetic moment operator .",
    "the method also allows us to calculate differential distributions , such as the charged lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons . for this case , the expansion parameter is the inverse of the energy release @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the lepton energy .",
    "close to the endpoint , the energy release is small and thus the expansion in its inverse powers becomes useless . in this kinematic region",
    "one may partially resume the @xmath4 expansion , obtaining a result closely analogous to the leading twist term in deep inelastic scattering . particularly in the endpoint region a non - perturbative function is needed which corresponds to the parton distributions parametrizing the deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the main focus of this review have been the non - perturbative corrections , and we did not consider the perturbative ones . in general ,",
    "the non - perturbative contributions are typically a few percent , while the perturbative ones are usually in excess of ten percent .",
    "an exception is the endpoint region of semileptonic decay spectra , where both the perturbative and the non - perturbative corrections become large and it becomes hard to disentangle the two .",
    "the method of the @xmath4 expansion allows us to systematically calculate even purely hadronic _ inclusive _ rates .",
    "this is remarkable , since calculations of _ exclusive _ hadronic processes are still very model dependent and thus in general not reliable .",
    "having control over the purely hadronic inclusive widths means that one is in the position to calculate lifetimes and branching fractions within the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "the leading term of the @xmath4 expansion is the free quark decay , and it is known that the semileptonic branching fraction calculated in the parton model is too large by a few percent .",
    "the first non - perturbative corrections turn out to be much too small to explain the low semileptonic branching fraction .",
    "the perturbative corrections are larger and indeed tend to lower the semileptonic branching fraction , but the effect is still too small to explain the data .",
    "recent calculations @xcite indicate that there are some effects originating from the finite mass of the final state quarks , in particular in the channel @xmath126 . however , enlarging this channel relative to @xmath127 will increase the average number @xmath128 of charm quarks produced per @xmath12 decay .",
    "experimentally , @xmath128 is close to unity , @xmath129 @xcite , while an explanation of the low semileptonic branching fraction via an enhancement of the channel @xmath126 would lead to @xmath130 .",
    "the problem of the semileptonic branching fraction is at the level of a two standard deviation discrepancy , and another problem of about the same significance are the lifetimes of @xmath12 hadrons .",
    "lifetime differences between @xmath5 mesons should show up a the level of the @xmath131 corrections and thus should be small .",
    "this is supported by data ; however , the situation is different for the lifetime of @xmath12 baryons .",
    "their lifetime may differ at the @xmath85 level and hence are expected to be of the order of a few percent .",
    "experimentally one finds a large lifetime difference between the @xmath132 and the @xmath5 mesons : @xmath133 ."
