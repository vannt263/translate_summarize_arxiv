    "measuring metallicities with @xmath15 precision in high@xmath16 damped ly@xmath1  systems ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) has become a standard technique for tracing chemical evolution in neutral gas over a large fraction of a hubble time .",
    "surveys of damped ly@xmath1  systems ( dlas ) contrast observations with models of chemical evolution , attempting to understand the nature of the objects hosting the absorbing clouds and to assess the degree of metal enrichment of gas in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the anticipated increase of [ m / h ] with cosmic time has become apparent only recently with the dramatic increase in sample size over the last few years ( prochaska et al .",
    "however , this evolutionary trend is hidden by a considerable scatter in [ m / h ] of @xmath17 dex @xmath18 , that is seen at every epoch from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the observed cosmic abundance spread at a given epoch is attributed to two distinct effects : ( 1 ) lines of sight to background qsos probe a single location in dlas at a random impact parameter , so gradients in dlas will produce different abundances and dust - to - gas ratios , and ( 2 ) dlas arise in a variety of galaxy types with different star formation and enrichment histories , as observed at low redshift ( e.g. , boisse et al .",
    "1998 ; rao et al.2003 ) .",
    "adding to the scatter , the overall census of dlas might be biased toward lower metallicities because qsos in front of very dusty and metal - rich absorbers might be missed entirely by optical surveys ( e.g. , pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ; but see ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "dlas probed by two or more lines - of - sight offer a way to test these theories of the observed scatter in [ m / h ] while also further probing the nature of dlas .",
    "the small impact parameters involved make gravitationally lensed qsos the ideal tool for studying dlas this way .",
    "the number of lens systems at high redshift , however , is small and so also the number of intervening dlas ( le brun et al . 2000 ; smette , claeskens , & surdej 1997 ) .",
    "the relative faintness of qsos and the small separations on the sky make spatially resolved , high - resolution spectroscopy challenging , and from the few cases studied , no separate dla abundances have been obtained ( smette et al .  1995 ; zuo et al 1997 ; lopez et al .  1999 ; kobayashi et al . 2002 ; churchill et al.2003 ; ellison et al .",

    "the position angle of the two point sources is @xmath23 n to e , with the brighter component ( herafter a ) to the north .",
    "the small separation of he0512@xmath23329  makes ground - based spectroscopy extremely challenging and since achieving cleanly separated spectra is crucial for the present study , a good fraction of this paper is devoted to a description of data reduction (   [ section_obs ] ) and possible systematic effects (  3 ) . the derived abundances at @xmath0 are presented in   4 , again with careful consideration of possible systematics .",

    "spatially resolved spectra of he0512@xmath23329  a and b were obtained with the space telecope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in first - order grating spectroscopic mode using g230l with the mama detector and g430l with the ccd .",
    "details of the observations and data reduction are found in paper i. the wavelength coverage is @xmath26 to @xmath27   at a spectral resolution of @xmath28   in the blue and @xmath29 in the red , or @xmath30 km  s@xmath7 .",

    "he0512@xmath23329  was observed using the vlt uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the nights of january 2 and 3 2003 .",
    "the spectra of both qsos were acquired simultaneously by aligning the slit with the 2 images .",
    "this was judged the best way to quantify the amount of cross - talk between the partially resolved spectra .",
    "since paranal median seeing values are critically close to the separation between qso images , service mode was preferred ( with its associated caveats , see below ) .",
    "the dichroic @xmath34 setup was used , which covers @xmath35   in the blue arm , and @xmath36   in the red one .",
    "eight @xmath37 seconds exposures were obtained , with seeing monitor values ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",

    "extraction of cleanly separated spectra becomes challenging .    to obtain separate spectra of he0512@xmath23329  a and",
    "b , we used our own reduction pipeline to extract spectra of multiple objects in echelle data .",
    "the algorithm is based on a simultaneous psf fit to each of the seeing profiles with consideration of pixel variances .",
    "the fits are performed twice : first allowing all psf parameters to vary , then constraining psf width and position by modelling them with low - order polynomials along the spectral direction .",
    "the extracted flux is defined by the synthetic profiles , and a @xmath42 flux error array results from propagation of errors ( lopez et al .",
    "1999 ) . in he0512@xmath23329 ,",
    "the spatial profile was found to be well - represented by a moffat function ( moffat 1969 ) with best - fit index parameter @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_reduction]a ) .    besides spatial resolution ,",
    "low s / n is also a problem in the present uves data .",
    "on - chip binning in the spectral direction only could not be carried out because this was not offered in service mode .",
    "attempts to extract the qso spectra from the unbinned data were unsuccessful , resulting in large flux residuals , leading us to bin the data by 4 pixels in the dispersion direction ; the data have an initial fwhm=@xmath44 pixels , so there is margin enough for rebinning . to this end ,",
    "the echelle orders were first unbent. fortunately , the use of gratings as cross - dispersers makes uves data free from distortions in the spatial direction ( no emission line tilts ) , so the order rectification is not critical .",
    "rectification was done with our own script , which traces the echelle orders with a hough transform ( ballester 1994 ) , re - samples the data in the spatial direction , computes the distance ( in fractions of a pixel ) to the center of the order definition , and re - allocates pixels with respect to a new , straight order definition .",
    "the rectified orders could then be re - binned @xmath45 along the spectral direction now aligned with the ccd rows thus increasing the s / n without distorting the spatial profile .",
    "the goodness of the treatment is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_reduction]a , where the spatial profile of the standard star keeps its symmetry and moffat - function - like form after the two processes .    even at the improved s / n",
    ", the closeness of the two objects did not allow us to robustly determine a psf width from global fits along the orders .",
    "instead , this parameter ( the actual seeing ) was obtained from single - profile fits at wavelengths where one of the qsos is completely absorbed by saturated @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_reduction]b ) .",
    "the spatial separation between qso profiles was held fixed at @xmath22 , as determined from the space - based observations .",
    "we found that the extracted spectrum of qso a does not reach zero at the position of where we expect totally black absorption .",
    "one possible explanation for this residual is emission by the lensing galaxy at @xmath32 . to explore this , we averaged columns all the way along the absorption troughs  some tens of pixels  to obtain an averaged qso profile ( the rectified orders permit this operation ) .",
    "up to 10% flux excess is present to the north of _ both _ qsos .",
    "this psf asymmetry is barely apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig_reduction]b [ although the figure shows just one column ] , and , although it explains the residual flux in qso a , it seems to exclude the possibility that the excess is from the lensing galaxy ( this is because any emission excess between the two qso images would appear to the north of qso b only ) .",
    "the extracted spectra were corrected by subtracting a pedestal at the level of up to 10% of the qso b flux .",
    "the possible effect of this correction on absorption line parameters will be considered below .",
    "finally , to wavelength calibrate the extracted orders , exactly the same pre - processing was applied to the th - ar exposures .",
    "the final wavelength solution is accurate to rms @xmath46 pixel . before coadding orders ,",
    "the spectra were rebinned to a common vacuum - heliocentric scale with pixel size of @xmath47  .",
    "the final spectral resolution in the coadded spectra is fwhm @xmath48 km  s@xmath7(@xmath49 binned pixels ) , and the final s / n per pixel is @xmath50 for both a and b. finally , the coadded orders were normalized directly by simultaneously dividing out the response function and qso continuum .",
    "the continuum was estimated independently in a and b by fitting cubic splines though featureless spectral regions .",
    "unfortunately , a proper extraction of the blue - arm spectra was impossible given both the too poor spatial sampling and the lack of absorbed regions , needed to characterize the psf .",
    "the final , usable , wavelength coverage is @xmath51 to @xmath52  .",
    "we used two methods to obtain column densities : the apparent optical depth method ( aodm ; savage & sembach 1991 ) and voigt profile fitting .",
    "the fits were performed with the midas package fitlyman ( fontana & ballester 1995 ) . while both methods offer similar results for weak transitions , strong blending is more realiably asssessed by profile fitting .",
    "only metal lines believed to be non - saturated were fitted ( see below ) .",
    "oscillator strengths , @xmath53 , were taken from the new compilation by morton ( 2000 ) , and solar abundances from grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .    while the uv stis spectra are necessary for determining @xmath3@xmath54 , accurate determination of the metal abundances requires the much higher spectral resolution provided by uves .",
    "these two datasets suffer respectively from two possible systematic effects : bad continuum estimate , and cross - talk between uves spectra .",
    "since the main goal of the present study is to detect possible line - of - sight differences in the absorption line parameters , in the following we describe in detail these sources of error .    as a zeroth order approach",
    "we compare the reduced uves spectra with the stis data , which we assume to be fully resolved spatially . in fig .",
    "[ fig_smooth ] we show a comparison between the spectra redwards of the quasar ly@xmath1  emission ; the high resolution data have been smoothed and rebinned to stis specifications .",
    "a @xmath55   shift was applied to the hst spectra to match the uves vacuum - heliocentric wavelength scale ( in the stis acquisition images we found an offset from the image center of about 2 pixels , which , given the wide slit used , would correspond to a shift in the dispersion direction of @xmath56  ) .",
    "we note a good match in the displayed transitions , which supports a proper extraction of the uves spectra .",
    "most of the lines detected in the stis spectra are actually saturated , and so this makes it impossible to fairly compare column densities of a and b. indeed , unsaturated transitions are lost in the noise of the stis data .",
    "we attempted a comparison of equivalent widths between ( unconvolved ) uves and stis non - saturated lines ; while consistency is found in a few cases , most of these lines are not detected at the @xmath57 significance level in the stis spectra .",
    "thus , a comparison of stis and uves data serves as a valuable consistency check between the ground and space - based observations ; however , even flux discrepancies in the uves data as high as 10% , or equivalent width differences as high as @xmath58% in non - saturated lines would be impossible to detect at the modest s / n and spectral resolution of the stis data .    to assess the impact of possible cross - talk effects on column densities",
    ", we computed equivalent widths of several _ weak _ lines in the uves spectra , typically of @xmath31 m , observed .",
    "mock echelle orders were then created in which 10% of the non - normalized flux of one qso was respectively added to and subtracted from the other qso .",
    "the mock spectra were renormalized , and equivalent widths of the same absorption lines were re - computed .",
    "we found typical deviations of the order @xmath59% in equivalent width .",
    "for intrinsically strong transitions , e.g. , @xmath60 , this equivalent width corresponds to @xmath61 @xmath5 , and the differences translate into 0.04 dex deviations .",
    "we will assume this is the column density uncertainty that propagates from the uves extraction .",
    "finally , besides internal errors in the fit we have to account for another possible systematic error , namely the continuum definition . while not a problem in the uves data , the continuum at the damped ly@xmath1  lines might be affected by ly@xmath1  forest interlopers . to account for this",
    ", we performed a series of fits on spectra normalized by different qso continua .",
    "the modified continua were artificially displaced by @xmath62 from the flux error array .",
    "the new fits led to column densities that differed by @xmath63 dex from the original values . since internal fit errors were @xmath64 dex , and since both errors are uncorrelated , we will assume a final 0.08 dex uncertainty in the measurements .",
    "we next describe our measurements of column densities and abundances in dla a and b. table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the results of this section .",
    "the column density comes from ly@xmath1  as observed in the stis spectra ( fig .",

    "we have not been able to accurately quantify [ mn / fe ] in dla b , but the present data are consistent with a similar ratio as in dla a. this solar ratio _ might _ be taken as evidence for dust also in b since all observed dlas have underabundant mn unless [ zn / fe ] @xmath142 , an established indicator of dust depletion .",
    "however , the cosmic scatter of [ mn / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath143 is larger and there are some examples of high [ mn / fe ] even at low [ zn / fe ] . furthermore , our derived lower limit on fe / h translates into a potentially lower mn / fe ratio , more in line with the general trend of dlas at the low - depletion end .      supposing that the [ mn / fe ] in both a and b implies homogeneously distributed dust , a real metallicity gradient appears at a first glance as an attractive explanation for the transverse differences in [ m / h ] .",
    "in nearby spirals metallicity gradients as a function of galactocentric radius are found in the range @xmath144 to @xmath145 dex kpc@xmath7 ( e.g. , vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ) . that the two images of he0512@xmath23329  are of similar brightness and that the lens is probably the dla galaxy under study both imply the absorbing regions must lie more or less equidistant from the galaxy center , not farther than @xmath131 @xmath132 kpc(the lensing galaxy has so far not been detected , so its exact location is undetermined ) .",
    "this is consistent with the similar in dla a and b. a simple model of varying metallicity with radius , therefore , can not explain the differences observed at similar impact parameters .",
    "aternatively , differential dust depletion offers a plausible explanation of the abundance differences . as stated above , in a",
    "there is dust depletion by a factor of @xmath146 .",
    "we now suppose that , on the contrary , in b the depletion is minimal , which is still consistent with [ mn / fe ] @xmath147 given [ m / h ] @xmath148 .",
    "there is enough evidence that at least some dlas are bound to rotating systems , so some sightlines should encounter dlas in disk+halo configurations .",
    "one such examples have been found by quast , reimers & baade ( 2004 ) in the @xmath149 dla toward he 0515@xmath24414 .",
    "the velocity components there cover the whole range of depletion patterns from warm halo ( [ cr / zn ] @xmath150 dex ) to warm disk ( @xmath151 ) observed in our galaxy . in he0512@xmath23329",
    ", the abundance pattern of dla a closely resembles that of the the galactic warm halo ( see fig.6 in savage & sembach ) , with mn and fe depleted by a factor of 34 . in consequence ,",
    "the different fe and mn abundances can be explained by lines of sight crossing warm halo - like regions that are subject to distinct dust depletion factors , with dla b being less dusty .    in this scenario ,",
    "the observed differences of [ m / h ] in he0512@xmath23329 , where m are refractory elements , become a different and direct confirmation for the hypothesis of dust - depletion in dlas .",
    "moreover , we would expect differential reddening between qso a and b ( pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ) .",
    "photometric data of he0512@xmath23329  ( gregg et al . ) in fact show that extinction along the line of sight to qso a is greater , although as pointed out in paper i , a chromatic effect of microlensing could also be present . as a rough estimate , @xmath71@xmath152 dex leads to an expected color - excess of @xmath153 if dust is present . with an smc type extinction curve",
    "we get @xmath154 ( this is the shortest reliable wavelength of the extinction curve ) , which gives @xmath155 mag for an extinction factor of 2.2 .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath156 ratio from the stis spectra plus an aditional contribution due to microlensing ( paper i ) .",
    "the underlying assumption here is that the dust responsible for the depletion of fe in dla a is the same as for the extinction , a reasonable approach since extinction in the uv is dominated by small dust grains like iron oxides ( see prochaska & wolfe 2002 for a complete discussion ) .",
    "finally , one concern on the differential - dust hypothesis : high - redshift dlas in general do not appear to produce significant dust - redenning ( murphy & liske 2004 ) . in consequence , either dust at @xmath32 is not the main agent of the differential reddening observed in he0512@xmath23329 , or dla a is not representative of the systems studied by murphy & liske .",
    "regardless of the extent to which dust - depletion is acting differentially to alter [ fe / h ] , one key consequence of the sightline differences in he0512@xmath23329  is their connection to the cosmic spread in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the present sample of metallicity measurements at all redshifts is distributed within [ fe / h ] @xmath157 dex ( see prochaska et al .",
    "2003a for the latest compilation ) .",
    "the overall spread is a consequence of a mild but readily noticeable evolution of metals over a hubble time .",
    "petinni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , however , found that even sub - samples within narrow redshift bins show large scatter of more than 1 dex .",
    "this is not attributable only to dust - depletion ( [ zn / h ] vs.  @xmath158 shows a similar behaviour , and zinc is not depleted ) ; different star formation histories must contribute to the inhomogeneity . despite this , if the dla in front of he0512@xmath23329  is representative of @xmath159 dlas , then the present sample of dla abundances must be randomly biased by effects other than galaxy type , such as the specific evolutionary stage in a particular line of sight , perhaps a high recent sn rate , or high star - formation rate with many uv emitting stars , which in the case of dla b may have inhibited dust formation . in the overall context",
    "this would mean that the `` patchiness '' of star formation in a given galaxy dominates which type of dla we observe ; furthermore , this stochastic ingredient could be more marked at higher redshifts , where mixing has had less time to occur . in conclusion ,",
    "part of the cosmic scatter must be due to these local effects which can not be studied comprehensively .",
    "obtaining better - quality optical spectra of he0512@xmath23329  a and b , especially in the spectral region covering and transitions , could offer important diagnostics for our understanding of abundances in dlas as a whole .",
    "we have studied the damped ly@xmath1  system at @xmath0 in front of qso he0512@xmath23329 .",
    "this system is particularly advantageous for new insights into dla studies because it is probed by two lines of sight , most likely on opposite sides of the lensing galaxy .",
    "we have confirmed the damped nature of the system in the two lines of sight and obtained column densities with help of spatially resolved stis spectroscopy .",
    "then , in a second result , we have obtained column densities of and in both lines of sight from ground - based echelle spectroscopy .",
    "this dla becomes only the sixth case at @xmath129 with measured metallicity .",
    "we have assessed and quantified the sources of systematic error in the column densities , given ( 1 ) the challenging character of the data reduction and ( 2 ) the small set of transitions that could be measured .",
    "we inspected in detail cross - talk effects in the echelle data , continuum estimates in the stis data , and saturation effects in the reduced spectra .",
    "armed in the end with a small set of mn and fe abundances in each of the sightlines , our third result is the discovery of significant differences , @xmath160 dex in both [ mn / h ] and [ fe / h ] , on a transverse scale of @xmath55 @xmath132 kpc , while [ mn / fe ] appears solar in both a and b. our treatment of errors leaves no doubt that the gradient is real , and we have discussed two possible causes : different nucleosynthesis yields and differential dust - depletion .",
    "regardless of what produces the gradient in this particular dla , our finding offers a compelling explanation for the source of scatter in the observed evolution of metals in the neutral universe .    we have benefitted from comments made by sara ellison , cedric ledoux , and celine peroux .",
