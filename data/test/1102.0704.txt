    "significant effort is being made to discover the higgs boson at the large hadron collider .",
    "if the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson is ruled out in all of its allowed mass range , the next step will be to find out if a higgs ( a remnant of weakly coupled electroweak symmetry breaking ) exists at all . in doing so , one must consider all possible reasonable decay modes due to new physics .",
    "the phenomenology of a sm higgs boson with mass @xmath6 gev is dominated by the relatively weak yukawa couplings characterized by the ratio of light fermion masses and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs . because the higgs vev ( @xmath7 gev ) is so much larger than the mass of any of the fermions to which the higgs boson can decay , given restriction on @xmath8 from precision electroweak tests @xcite , these couplings are quite small , and therefore the width of the light higgs boson into sm particles is quite low ( @xmath9 mev for @xmath10 gev ) .",
    "with such a small decay width , new light particles , even with a relatively small couplings to the higgs , could easily be its dominate decay product . under any such model",
    ", sm higgs searches could be rendered useless .",
    "the simplest possible extension to the higgs sector involves the addition of a gauge singlet scalar , @xmath11 .",
    "various new physics models contain such a field , such as non - minimal supersymmetry and composite ( and little ) higgs models ( for a review , see @xcite ) . given a coupling between the higgs field and the @xmath11 field @xmath12",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking allows the decay @xmath13 . without any additional terms in the lagrangian ,",
    "the @xmath11 would be stable and experimentalists would need to search for an invisible higgs  such a phenomenological possibility has been studied in , e.g. @xcite .",
    "other reasonable possibilities include a model in which the @xmath11 and the higgs boson mix , in which case the @xmath11 picks up sm higgs branching ratios to sm particles . for most of the reasonable parameter space ,",
    "this would lead to the dominant decay chain @xmath14 .",
    "searches for this final state have been performed with lep data and a lower bound of 110 gev has been set @xcite .",
    "other simple and natural models , where @xmath11 is a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite , can easily allow @xmath15 ( gluons ) to dominate ( see for example @xcite ) or lighter quarks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "previous work has been done on the phenomenology of @xmath16 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds for such signals are large , as are those for the sm @xmath17 .",
    "the sm case was approached more recently by looking at the phase space where the higgs is produced in association with a vector boson , and the two particles are produced with large @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "not only are leptonic decays of the gauge boson a nice discriminant from qcd production , the sm background ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 plus jets ) drops much faster than the signal at large @xmath18 due to the fact that the background is dominated by t - channel diagrams while the signal is dominated by the s - channel .",
    "their analysis used jet deconstruction and reconstruction tools partly developed in early work @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the boosted higgs @xcite showed that a once hopeless signal became hopeful . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the application of boosted higgses analyses to non - standard higgs decays can have a dramatic impact on the reach of the lhc , not only in the @xmath16 channel , but in the notorious @xmath21 channel as well .",
    "vector boson plus jets and @xmath1 production will provide significant backgrounds to our signal , but we find that discovery significance can be achieved in both channels for significant ranges of @xmath11 masses with more than 100 fb@xmath4 of data .",
    "work along these lines with much smaller ranges of parameters studied @xcite , or with significant model dependence @xcite , have appeared previously .",
    "this work had previously appeared in a phd .",
    "thesis @xcite .",
    "we generate both signals and backgrounds using the madgraph / madevent v4.3 package @xcite @xcite .",
    "these events are showered through pythia @xcite and jet clustering is performed using the routines in the fastjet @xcite libraries .",
    "vector bosons which decay hadronically are difficult to distinguish from hadronic activity arising through qcd , so we proceed based on an analysis of leptonic decays of vector bosons .",
    "these come in three types for our signal : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents a charged light lepton ( muon or electron ) . in order to simulate",
    "lepton isolation cuts applied experimentally , we neglect from our analysis leptons which have @xmath26 gev , or for which there is significant hadronic activity in an isolation cone of size @xmath27 around the lepton ( significant meaning a scalar sum of @xmath18 more than @xmath28 of the @xmath18 of the lepton itself ) .",
    "leptons vetoed in this way are included in the hadronic activity of the event .",
    "events are then classified into one of three channels ; the first requires the presence of two opposite - charge , same flavor leptons which reconstruct to an invariant mass of @xmath29 gev with total @xmath30 gev . failing this , events with a lepton and missing @xmath31 which reconstruct to an invariant transverse mass of at most @xmath32 gev ( @xmath33 gev greater than the @xmath19 mass ) with a total @xmath30 gev",
    "are accepted into the second channel .",
    "finally , events which simply have @xmath34 gev are accepted via the third channel . the energy resolution on electrons and muons at atlas and cms",
    "is expected to be of the order of a few percent , while the resolution on missing @xmath31 is expected to be @xmath35 gev for events in which the scalar sum of @xmath18 is @xmath36 gev .",
    "we neglect the energy and angular resolution on isolated light leptons .",
    "the production cross - sections @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are relatively flat as a function of the @xmath18 of the outgoing vector boson ( @xmath40 difference from @xmath41 gev , and from @xmath42 gev ) .",
    "the effect of smearing is to change the number of events that pass the cuts by at most a few percent , and thus we ignore the missing @xmath31 smearing . as can be seen from table [ tab : lepcuts ] , the efficiency with which signal events ( in which the boson decays leptonically or invisibly and has sufficient @xmath18 ) pass these cuts is @xmath43 , and most of the passed events are characterized properly ( e.g. events with a @xmath19 boson pass the lepton + missing @xmath31 cut ) .",
    "however , a significant minority of @xmath1 pass the pure @xmath44 cut instead of @xmath45 , due to the charged lepton being non - central or too close to a hadronic jet .",
    ".cross - sections in picobarns after successive cuts on leptons and @xmath44 for associated higgs production and backgrounds .",
    "the `` inclusive '' column gives the production cross - section with no cuts .",
    "the `` @xmath46 '' column gives the production cross - section for events in which there is a vector boson ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) with @xmath30 gev ( including all decay modes for this boson ) .",
    "these cross - sections are presented to leading order . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : heavyresults ]",
    "by restricting our search to a very specific part of phase space ( high @xmath18 associated higgs production ) , it is possible to strongly reduce the sm background while only weakly reducing the higgs signal . the high @xmath18 threshold on the vector boson leads to a signal sample of high @xmath18 higgs bosons , which means that the decay products of the higgs , under any physics model , tend to be collimated in a relatively small region in the detector .",
    "using analysis of the subjet structure present due to cascade higgs decays through a light scalar we ve demonstrated the feasibility of a flavor - independent search for scalar masses from @xmath47 gev with @xmath48 fb@xmath4 .",
    "this , for example , is the broadest parameter space suggested by any search strategy thus far presented for the decay @xmath49 and thus may be a viable search at the lhc . if cascade higgs decays proceed primarily to @xmath5 quarks then flavor tagging can increase the significance of the search dramatically . for the high range of scalar masses , @xmath50 gev @xmath51",
    "the options are more limited ; assuming reasonable @xmath5 tagging efficiency and purity , discovery significance can also be achieved with @xmath48 fb@xmath4 .",
