    "recently , there has been some excitement in the research community working on the holographic principle and stringy / supergravity black holes following the observation that the products of killing horizon areas for certain multi - horizon black holes are independent of the black hole mass and depend only on the quantized charges ( supergravity and extra - dimensional black holes with angular momentum and electric and magnetic charges were considered ) @xcite .",
    "older results on black holes far from extremality @xcite induce one to take into account both outer and inner black hole horizons when studying the quantization of black hole entropies and horizon areas .",
    "expressions for products of the horizon areas of black holes in four and higher dimension have been hypotesized or suggested @xcite and then questioned in more recent work @xcite .",
    "this literature is inspired by the holographic principle and string theories ( although the results are not , strictly speaking , derived from string theories ) , and it stems from the underlying idea that quantized products of areas depending on combinations of integers must carry the signature of some specific microphysics .",
    "this feature would not be too surprising if the area @xmath0 of an horizon is related to its entropy @xmath1 through the famous bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath2 ( in units in which @xmath3 ) and corresponds to a statistical mechanics based on microscopic models counting microstates determined by quantum gravity ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when there are outer ( @xmath4 ) and inner ( @xmath5 ) horizons , the quantization rules recurrent in the literature are [ expression1 ] a _ = 8 l_pl^2 ( ) , n_1 , n_2 , or [ expression2 ] a_+ a_- =( 8 l_pl^2)^2 n , n , where @xmath6 is the planck length @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 are integers for supersymmetric extremal black holes but are related to the numbers of branes , antibranes , and strings in less simple situations @xcite . a weaker rule states that the product of horizon areas is independent of the black hole mass and depends only on the quantized charges",
    ". rules of the type  ( [ expression2 ] ) are found for einstein - maxwell black holes in 5 and 6 dimensions , asymptotically flat @xcite , or asymptotically de sitter or anti - de  sitter , and also for black holes in @xmath8 and @xmath9 dimensions @xcite and it seems to apply also to black rings and black strings in higher dimension @xcite ( asymptotically de sitter and anti - de sitter black holes in general relativity and other theories of gravity , in various dimensions , are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "a word of caution against the temptation of regarding these rules as universal for all types of black holes endowed with multiple horizons @xcite has been voiced by visser @xcite .",
    "visser considered black holes in 4-dimensional general relativity and found that , in these situations , products of areas do not give mass - independent quantities , nor are they related in a simple way to integers .",
    "rather , it is quadratic combinations of the various horizon radii ( with the dimensions of an area , which can be referred to as `` generalized areas '' ) which generate mass - independent quantities and are , presumably , the best candidates to be quantized @xcite , although no evidence has been presented thus far that these generalized areas have any special physical significance . moreover , it is essential to include in these algebraic combinations also cosmological and virtual horizons in addition to the black hole horizons @xcite .",
    "virtual horizons correspond to negative or imaginary roots of the equation locating the horizons ( which , in non - asymptotically flat solutions of the einstein equations , provides also cosmological horizons ) .",
    "the quantization rules break down also for general myers - perry black holes in dimension @xmath10 and for kerr - anti - de sitter black holes with @xmath11 unless the virtual horizons are included in the picture @xcite .    in this note",
    "we point out a fact which induces even more caution in discussing the products of horizon areas .",
    "the horizons considered in the literature are killing ( and event ) horizons .",
    "realistic black holes are not stationary if nothing else because they emit hawking radiation and the backreaction due to this effect changes their masses which become time - dependent , together with their horizon radii and areas . for astrophysical black holes",
    "the effect is completely negligible but the same can not be said for quantum black holes .",
    "therefore , a timelike killing vector will not be present and in realistic situations one should consider not killing and event horizons , but other kinds of horizons .",
    "dynamical horizons have received much attention in quantum gravity @xcite ; at present it seems that apparent horizons ( `` ah ' 's , see @xcite for reviews ) are the best and most versatile candidates for the notion of time - dependent `` horizon '' and it is claimed that thermodynamical laws can be associated with ahs @xcite . in any case ,",
    "ahs are used as proxies for event horizons in studies of gravitational collapse in numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "ahs coincide with event horizons in stationary situations but , in dynamical situations , they are spacelike or even timelike . in the following we consider dynamical situations and we focus on ahs .",
    "here we consider three toy models of _ dynamical _ black holes , which are implemented by embedding them in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological `` background '' ( we use quotation marks because , due to the non - linearity of the einstein equations , one can not split the metric into a background and a deviation from it in a covariant way ) . in the first model , a mcvittie spacetime , there are a black hole , a cosmological , and a virtual horizon . in the second model , a generalized mcvittie solution of the einstein equations , the `` mcvittie no - accretion condition ''",
    "is relaxed to allow accretion of energy and then we have either two real horizons ( a black hole and a cosmological horizon ) or two virtual horizons .",
    "the third model consists of an electrically charged ( but non - accreting ) generalization of the mcvittie spacetime . in this case",
    "there is a charge to quantize , but the behaviour of the horizons is the same as in the uncharged case .",
    "our main point is that , in dynamical situations , even if combinations of ah radii which are mass - independent exist , they depend continuously on time and can not be expressed as combinations of integers .",
    "the mcvittie metric @xcite describes a black hole embedded in a flrw universe , which is a truly dynamical spacetime . limiting ourselves , for simplicity , to a spatially flat flrw `` background ''",
    ", the line element can thus be written in the form @xcite",

    "the locally static schwarzschild - de sitter - kottler spacetime corresponds to @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the cosmological constant ) and is a special case of the mcvittie metric which can be obtained using a simple transformation of the time coordinate @xcite . assuming a perfect fluid stress energy tensor , the einstein equations provide the energy density @xmath22 and pressure @xmath23 of the `` background '' fluid .",
    "again for simplicity , let us restrict ourselves to a cosmic fluid which reduces to dust ( equation of state parameter @xmath24 ) at spatial infinity , then ( t)= h^2(t ) , p(t , r ) = ( t ) ( -1 ) [ pressure ] .",

[ inversemcvittie ] for any spherically symmetric metric written in terms of the areal radius @xmath15 , the ahs are located by solving the equation @xmath25 or @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "for the schwarzschild - de sitter - kottler spacetime , which is a special case of mcvittie , this equation coincides with the horizon condition reported in @xcite but , in the general case , the hubble parameter is time - dependent instead of constant .",
    "this cubic equation r^3 - + = 0 has three solutions which , under conditions specified below , correspond to a time - dependent black hole ah with ( proper ) radius @xmath27 , a cosmological ah with radius @xmath28 , and a virtual ah with negative radius @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath13 and @xmath33 are both necessarily positive ( we only consider expanding universes ) and @xmath34 defines the negative root . as discussed in @xcite , the condition for the black hole and cosmological ahs to exist is @xmath35 , which corresponds to @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 , which is always satisfied ) . unlike the schwarzschild - de sitter - kottler case where the hubble parameter is a constant , this inequality will only be satisfied at certain times during the cosmological expansion and will be violated at other times .",
    "the threshold between these two regimes is the time at which @xmath38 ( for a dust - dominated `` background '' with @xmath39 , this critical time is @xmath40 ) . at early times",

    "this situation can be regarded as a special case of visser s discussion @xcite computing mass - independent combinations of ah radii whenever the misner - sharp - hernandez mass is a laurent polynomial of the areal radius @xmath15 .",

    "the physical mass contained in a sphere is actually given by the misner - sharp - hernandez notion , but the cosmic fluid here serves the only purpose of generating a cosmological `` background '' to make the central black hole dynamical and it seems that the relevant mass to consider when mass - independent quantities such as ( [ massindependent1 ] ) and ( [ massindependent2 ] ) are searched for is the black hole contribution @xmath13 , not the total @xmath50 . in any case , the ah radii identify different spheres and correspond to different misner - sharp - hernandez masses @xmath53 ( from eq .",

    "these ahs are real when @xmath61 and virtual when @xmath62 ( in which case we label them @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , which happens before a critical time @xmath65 .",

    "we conclude that it can not be expressed as a combination of integers .",
    "the misner - sharp - hernandez / hawking - hayward mass of the black hole ( when the latter exists ) is @xcite m_msh== ; it can not be split in any simple way into a contribution due to the central inhomogeneity and one due to the cosmic fluid inside the sphere of radius @xmath66 .",

    "the areal radius is simply @xmath76 and the equation locating the apparent horizons becomes = r^4 ( r - m ) ^2 or s(r ) r^2 ( r - m ) = in an expanding universe .",
    "the function @xmath77 is a cubic with a local maximum of zero value at @xmath78 and a local minimum ( of value @xmath79 ) at @xmath80 ; in the physical range @xmath81 it is always increasing , starting from zero at @xmath82 and going to infinity as @xmath83 .",

    "( a detailed analysis of the apparent horizons of the charged mcvittie spacetime , including the extremal case , will be reported elsewhere . )",
    "the cosmological black holes reported here are just toy models for dynamical black hole horizons : the main point is that realistic black holes are time - dependent , not stationary",
    ". therefore , far - reaching conclusions about the quantization of black hole horizon areas , or of quantities which are quadratic in the radii of killing horizons ( generalized areas ) , may be misleading and may not correspond to realistic , time - dependent , situations .",
    "it is interesting to probe the conjecture about mass - independence and generalized area quantization using examples of time - varying black holes in 4-dimensional general relativity before approaching higher - dimensional black objects in supergravity or stringy objects .",
    "exact solutions of the field equations of einstein theory describing time - varying black holes are not easy to find and we resort to the more well known cosmological black holes to provide examples of time - dependent black holes  the cosmological `` background '' is not conceptually essential here . in general , ahs depend on the spacetime foliation @xcite but in the presence of spherical symmetry , to which we have restricted ourselves , this does not appear to be a significant problem .",
    "for the mcvittie metric ( as well as for its special schwarzschild - de sitter - kottler static case ) there are generalized areas which are independent of the black hole mass .",
    "however , even if they can be expressed as @xmath87 times a combination of integers at some initial time , this expression changes as time goes by .",
    "the corresponding quantities for the generalized accreting mcvittie and the electrically charged mcvittie black holes are mass- and time - dependent .",
    "variations on the theme can be contemplated .",
    "if only the black hole and the cosmological ahs are retained and considered as physical , their area will be zero at all times @xmath88 ; zero is an integer , allright , but this interpretation entails an entropy suddenly jumping from zero ( describing a naked singularity in a flrw `` background '' ) to a value not reducible to a combination of integers and depending on the black hole mass . if the cosmological ah is excluded from the picture , then there remains only the black hole ah , the area of which is initially zero , then jumps to a positive value , and then decreases monotonically as time goes by ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "more complicated black holes with multiple ahs will lend themselves to the consideration of more possible combinations of the ah radii , but probably the most sensible way to proceed is to include all ah radii , even virtual ones , when searching for quantizable , mass - independent quantitites , as done in @xcite .",
    "when realistic time - dependent horizons are considered , however , the connection between products of areas and combinations of integers becomes even more speculative and perhaps it would be better to put it on a firmer ground or finding out its limits of validity before assuming it as a postulate or a necessary accessory of the holographic principle .",
    "this conclusion reinforces that of visser @xcite that the black holes of 4-dimensional general relativity do not seem to reconcile with the usual quantization rules ( [ expression1 ] ) and ( [ expression2 ] ) and casts serious doubts on the universality of these expressions .",
