    "several hundred young early - type stars lie in the vicinity of sgra@xmath4 , the compact radio source associated with the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "some of these stars lie in a near - keplerian disk , called clockwise ( cw ) disk from the motion that it shows when projected on the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the cw disk extends up to @xmath2 and is warped or tilted , since the orientation of its normal axis changes by @xmath5 from the inner edge to the outer edge .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest the presence of a second dissolving counterclockwise disk .",
    "however , recent results from @xcite show that the cw disk extends only up to @xmath6 and it is neither significantly warped nor tilted .",
    "moreover , @xcite find no evidence of counterclockwise motion and estimate that only @xmath7 of the o and wolf - rayet stars lie in the cw disk .",
    "the origin of the young stars is puzzling : the tidal shear from the smbh should disrupt nearby molecular clouds , preventing star formation .",
    "however , a disrupted molecular cloud might settle into a disk around the smbh , which could fragment and form stars ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this scenario can reproduce the observational features of the cw disk , but can not explain the young stars that do not lie in the disk .",
    "a possible scenario to explain such stars is to invoke precession effects , that perturb and dismember the cw disk .",
    "the smbh and the young stars are embedded into the cusp of the nuclear star cluster , which has a nearly spherical density profile @xcite and is a source of mass precession and two - body relaxation @xcite . the circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) , a ring of molecular gas that orbits the smbh with a radius of @xmath0 , might also perturb the cw disk .",
    "in particular , the nearly axisymmetric potential of the cnr might induce precession of the mean orbital elements of a stellar orbit , specifically inclination @xmath8 , eccentricity @xmath9 , argument of periapsis @xmath10 and longitude of the ascending node @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if the plane of the orbit and the plane of the axisymmetric potential are misaligned , periodic oscillations in inclination and eccentricity appear .",
    "these oscillations , called kozai - lidov cycles @xcite , might be suppressed by the presence of a strong spherical potential , such as the stellar cusp @xcite .",
    "while these dynamical processes have been investigated for a long time , there is still debate on the actual importance of kozai - lidov and precession effects . in particular",
    ", the interplay between the cnr and the stellar cusp is still unclear , and previous studies neglected the influence of gas lying in the inner cavity ( i.e. inside the cnr ) .",
    "our aim is to investigate the precession induced by dense gaseous rings on the cw disk .",
    "we generate such rings self - consistently , by simulating the disruption of a turbulence - supported molecular cloud . in this way",
    ", we obtain rings that match the main properties of the cnr , and we also account for the presence of warm gas in the inner cavity @xcite .",
    "we investigate precession effects by means of a direct - summation n - body code , coupled with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code thanks to the amuse software environment @xcite .",
    "in particular , we study the dependence of precession upon the angle between the cw disk and a gas ring .",
    "we show that the warm gas that lies in the inner cavity might substantially affect the evolution of the young stars in the galactic center ( gc ) . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we describe the methodology we employed for our simulations ; in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results . in section",

    "in our numerical model , the dynamics of the stellar disk is driven by two processes : two - body relaxation in the stellar disk and precession induced by the external potentials .",
    "the external potentials are the analytical cusp , which induces precession of the periapsis and the gas ring .",
    "the gas ring is irregular and clumpy , however we can consider its potential to be axisymmetric as a first approximation .",
    "such axisymmetric potential induces precession of the mean orbital elements of a single star on a timescale given by the kozai - lidov timescale : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the mass and radius of the gas ring , @xmath76 is the gravitational constant and @xmath37 is the semi - major axis of the star .",
    "the equations of motion of the mean orbital elements also depend on eccentricity @xmath9 and argument of periapsis @xmath10 ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "the inclination does not increase past @xmath94 .",

    "[ fig : eadistro ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : idistro ] ) .",
    "the combined effect of two - body relaxation and eccentric disk instability accounts for changes in eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity becomes bimodal after @xmath88 ( figure [ fig : eadistro ] , top panel ) .",
    "this is due to the eccentric disk instability described by @xcite , according to which the precession induced by a stellar cusp drives coherent torques that amplify deviations of individual orbital eccentricities from the average .",
    "in fact , we find the same bimodal distribution whether or not we include the gas ring .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite , who find the same bimodal distribution evolving a similar stellar disk in the potential of a stellar cusp .    while eccentric disk instability accounts for the bimodality of the eccentricity distribution , two - body relaxation accounts for its overall evolution .",
    "according to two - body relaxation theory of thin disks , the root mean square eccentricity and inclination should grow over time as @xcite : @xmath101    figure [ fig : rmsie ] shows the evolution of @xmath102 and @xmath62 along with the analytical predictions .",
    "it is apparent that the eccentricity evolution is well fit by the analytical predictions for both run a and d. this seems to indicate that the evolution of the eccentricity is predominantly driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "this is not the case for the evolution of inclinations .",
    "while the root mean square inclination of run d is consistent with the analytical predictions of two - body relaxation , the fit is inconsistent for run a , b and c. this is due to torques exerted by the gas ring onto the stellar disk . in fact , while the spherical cusp suppresses kozai - lidov cycles , it does not hinder the precession of the longitude of the ascending node , measured in the reference frame of the gas ring @xcite .",
    "such precession appears as a change in inclination in the reference frame of the stellar disk .",
    "this effect is apparent in figure [ fig : rmsi ] , which shows that the root mean square inclination of the stars remains constant if measured from the plane of the inner gas ring .",
    "moreover , runs a , b and c show higher inclinations at larger radius ( figure [ fig : iascatter ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stars on the outer orbits precess faster than those in the inner ones , as expected from the dependence of precession timescale on the semi - major axis ( @xmath103 , equation [ eq : tk ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite .    since the stars of the disk have different eccentricity and semi - major axis , they precess at different rates , ultimately causing the disk to dismember . the diffusion of the orbital parameters due to two - body relaxation enhances differential precession , accelerating the dismembering of the disk .",
    "to test the importance of two - body relaxation , we run a simulation ( named a1 ) with the same initial conditions as run  a , except that we set the stellar masses to zero . in this way we inhibit two - body relaxation , and the evolution of stellar orbits",
    "is driven by the external potentials .",
    "the inclination distribution in run  a1 at @xmath1 is shown in figure [ fig : idistrobackup ] .",
    "in contrast to run a , the inclinations do not spread and the distribution does not become bimodal . this indicates that the disk changes its orientation without losing coherence and the spiral - shaped tail of normal vectors in figure [ fig : maps ] does not form .",
    "thus , two - body relaxation is a key process in understanding the dismembering of a nearly - keplerian disk .",
    "this result is in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "since the stellar cusp is modeled as a rigid potential , we neglect additional two - body relaxation between cusp and disk stars .",
    "@xcite showed that a cusp of stellar remnants enhances the relaxation of angular momentum , increasing orbital eccentricities and disk thickness @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that that relaxation among disk stars dominates over the relaxation between cusp and disk stars .",
    "thus , we expect that a grainy cusp would enhance the disk disruption in our simulations by a negligible amount .",
    "we investigate the effect of gas rings on a nearly - keplerian stellar disk orbiting a smbh by means of combined sph and direct n - body simulations .",
    "we simulate the formation of a cnr - like gas ring through the infall and disruption of a molecular gas cloud towards the smbh .",
    "in particular , the gas cloud settles down into two concentric rings around the smbh : the outer ring matches the properties of the cnr in the gc ( inner radius @xmath104 , mass @xmath105 ) , while the inner ring is less massive ( @xmath106 ) and has an outer radius of @xmath107 .",
    "we make use of the amuse software to couple the sph simulation of the infalling gas cloud to a direct n - body code , which we use to integrate the evolution of the stellar disk .",
    "the stellar disk has properties similar to the cw disk and was formed self consistently by the infall and collapse of a disrupted molecular cloud .",
    "our simulations include the effect of the stellar cusp , modeled as a rigid potential .",
    "we simulate different inclinations @xmath42 between the infalling gas cloud and the stellar disk : @xmath43 ( run a ) , @xmath44 ( run b ) , @xmath45 ( run c ) .",
    "we find that the outer ring is inefficient in affecting the stellar orbits on a timescale of @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", the inner ring of gas can significantly affect the stellar disk inclination and coherence .",
    "the inner gas ring induces precession of the longitude of the ascending node @xmath3 on the disk stars , which appears as a change of the inclinations in the reference frame of the stellar disk . as a consequence , the disk precesses about the axis of symmetry of the inner gas ring .",
    "we do not find precession of eccentricity and inclination with respect to the gas ring , because it is suppressed by the stellar cusp .",
    "we find that the precession of @xmath3 is faster for smaller angles between the stellar disk and the inner gas ring @xmath53 , as expected from timescale dependence @xmath108 .",
    "after @xmath1 , the stellar disk has changed its orientation by @xmath64 , @xmath44 and @xmath109 in runs a ( @xmath93 ) , b ( @xmath87 ) and c ( @xmath110 ) , respectively .",
    "since the inclination changes are driven by @xmath3-precession , the stellar disk inclination can not increase more than twice the angle between the gas ring and the stellar disk ; as a consequence , the stars in run  b achieve an higher inclination with respect to run  a. we find that the combined effect of two - body relaxation and @xmath3-precession can displace stars from the disk .",
    "we verified that neither of the two processes can drive the disk dismembering alone .",
    "two - body relaxation introduces a spread in the orbital elements of the individual stars of the disk , inducing differential precession .",
    "this differential precession leads to the dismembering of the stellar disk , which loses @xmath111 of the stars in run  a ( @xmath93 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "in run  b ( @xmath87 ) , the disk lost only @xmath68 of the stars in @xmath1 , while in run  c ( @xmath110 ) @xmath3-precession is inefficient and the stellar disk remains coherent .",
