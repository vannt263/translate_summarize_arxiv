    "hydrodynamics @xcite provides a universal description of the long range , long time - scale behavior of a wide variety of thermal systems .",
    "the hydrodynamic quantities are those for which small perturbations from equilibrium have relaxation times which diverge as their wavelength diverges . as a result , hydrodynamics has been formulated as a classical effective field theory with various fields , typically the conserved quantities , playing the role of fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "hydrodynamic behavior has been seen to arise from finite temperature quantum field theory @xcite .    at the same time however , one feature that sets aside relativistic quantum field theories is the existence of quantum anomalies , which cause some classically conserved quantities to be non - conserved .",
    "an unsolved problem is how to incorporate the effects of quantum anomalies into the hydrodynamics description of a thermal field theory which contain anomalies . in a qcd plasma",
    ", the hydrodynamic theory should reproduce the three - point correlation functions including the anomalous part ( an example of such correlation functions is that of the axial vector , vector and baryon currents ) .",
    "another example is the massless qed plasma ( or the qed plasma at such high temperatures so that the mass of the electron can be neglected ) . in this case , magnetohydrodynamics has to be enlarged to incorporate the axial current @xmath3 .",
    "although this current is not conserved , @xmath4 , at large distances the total axial charge should change slowly because the conducting plasma can not support a large long - distance electric field @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a simpler problem where anomalies enter the hydrodynamic equations already at the linearized level .",
    "namely , we consider a theory with a set of global conserved charges @xmath6 for which the triple correlators contain anomalous contributions .",
    "we then turn on an external magnetic field coupled to one of the global charges .",
    "an example of such a system is high - temperature qcd in a very large magnetic field .",
    "now anomalies appear already at the level of two - point correlators , and hence should be manifested in the linearized hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we shall argue that in the presence of a background magnetic field coupled to some conserved charge , the constitutive equation for the currents is modified in the presence of quantum anomalies . in an anomalous theory , any current @xmath6 participating in an anomaly now receives a contribution @xmath7 so , in addition to the diffusion and ohmic current , there is a new , dissipationless contribution proportional to the magnetic field and a density of charges .",
    "it is important to note that this modification of the constitutive relation occurs regardless of whether the current itself is anomalously non - conserved .",
    "for example , in the massless qed mentioned above , both the axial vector current and the electromagnetic vector current receive this new term in their constitutive equations .",
    "this result has been obtained previously , by alekseev , cheianov , and frohlich , for the cases of 2d field theory , and massless qed  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will confirm their result , using different methods , as well as extending our analysis to a wider variety of systems .",
    "we use two complimentary approaches to elucidate the impact of quantum anomalies on the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "the first approach uses the gauge / gravity duality , in which the hydrodynamic behavior of currents in 4d thermal gauge theories is obtained from the dynamics of the dual yang ",
    "mills fields on black - brane backgrounds in higher - dimensions . in this approach",
    "the 4d quantum anomaly has a very simple dual description in the higher - dimensional theory  it corresponds to the 5d chern - simons term in the gauge action .",
    "this approach applies only to strongly coupled gauge theories with gravity duals , in particular , to @xmath8 super - yang - mills theory in the large @xmath0 , large thooft coupling regime . in the second approach , which is appropriate in the weak - coupling regime",
    ", we use a single particle spectrum treatment , similar to the `` level - crossing '' pictures usually used for explaining anomalies  @xcite , to examine the behavior of currents in a weakly coupled abelian gauge theory with axial anomaly . in both cases",
    "we perform our analysis in the background of a constant , homogeneous magnetic field and obtain _ the same _ additional term in the constitutive relation for an anomalous current .",
    "we then argue that the form of the new term in the constitutive equation that we found is exact , i.e. , independent of the strength of interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section ,",
    "we use simple symmetry arguments to motivate the inclusion of terms of the form in  @xcite in the hydrodynamics of anomalous theories . in the second section ,",
    "we explore the r - charge anomaly in the hydrodynamic regime of @xmath1 sym using a `` membrane paradigm '' treatment of the dual 5d theory which is very similar to that used in  @xcite to examine non - anomalous hydrodynamics in theories with gravitational duals . in the third section we present a quasiparticle analysis of the axial anomaly in massless qed at finite @xmath9 and finite ( electron ) chemical potential .",
    "next we present our argument for the universality of this result .",
    "this argument is based on the equilibrium form of a charge distribution in a system with non- vanishing gauge field . in section four",
    ", we consider the application of our results to qcd at high temperature and strong magnetic field .",
    "then , we conclude .",
    "the simplest model where the problem of anomalous hydrodynamics appears is qcd with two massless quark flavors .",
    "the conserved currents in the theory are the isospin current @xmath10 , the axial isospin current @xmath11 , and the and the baryon current @xmath12 .",
    "we turn on a background magnetic field @xmath13 coupled to the baryon current and discuss the hydrodynamic behavior of the isospin and the axial isospin currents .    in the absence of the magnetic field @xmath13 and at temperatures higher than the chiral phase transition , the hydrodynamic equations for the vector and axial charge densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the diffusion equations which can be written as the conservation laws @xmath16 coupled with the constitutive relations @xmath17 we recall that the form of the constitutive equations are dictated by the symmetries ( rotational , c and p ) and by the fact that we limit ourselves , in linearized hydrodynamics , to terms linear in fields with the lowest number of spatial derivatives .",
    "however , in the presence of the external magnetic field @xmath13 , it is possible to write additional linear terms @xmath18 the equations are obviously rotationally invariant . to see that they respect c and",
    "p invariance one recalls that under c @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , and under p @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not fixed by symmetries . in the next two sections we compute these coefficients in some simple theories",
    "in this section we follow an analysis developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which employed the gauge / gravity duality and the black - hole `` membrane paradigm '' to demonstrate hydrodynamic behavior in a variety of finite - temperature theories with holographic gravitational duals .",
    "we will work with the particular case of an @xmath29 super - yang - mills theory , believed dual to a stack of black d3 branes in @xmath30 .",
    "( the hydrodynamic behavior of this theory has been found directly . ) for the sake of completeness we will repeat many of the arguments used in ref .",
    "this repetition also serves to demonstrate explicitly where our assumptions do or do not differ from those of the previous work .",
    "the @xmath31 metric for our black brane configuration is , @xmath32 + \\frac{r^{2}}{4u^{2}(1-u^{2})}du^{2}.     \\label{eq : metric}\\ ] ] note the use of the dimensionless radial coordinate , @xmath33 , which is related to the usual radial coordinate @xmath34 and horizon location @xmath35 through @xmath36 .",
    "the theory possesses @xmath37 conserved r - charges , whose correlation functions are computable using ads / cft .",
    "the the 5d bulk action of the gauge field @xmath38 dual to the r - current , complete with chern - simons term is , @xmath39 in 5d , the chern - simons ( cs ) term is cubic in fields .",
    "thus , two point correlation functions can be calculated without this term , but three and higher @xmath40-point functions receive anomalous contributions from the cs term .",
    "the three - point functions can , in principle , be computed from the closed - time - path ads / cft prescription . in this paper , we compute two - point functions in the presence of a background magnetic field  which couples to the two - point functions through the cs term in the 5d action ,    in ref .",
    "@xcite the general idea , originated from the black - hole membrane paradigm , begins with defining conserved currents in terms of field tensors evaluated on a stretched horizon .",
    "the prescription for how to define these currents is lifted directly from the membrane paradigm  @xcite .",
    "then , one takes the long wavelength limit of the field equations in order to derive the constitutive equation for the currents .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the 5d maxwell equations imply fick s law from boundary currents , with a diffusion constant matching that found by direct ads / cft calculation in the case of @xmath29 sym .",
    "working in the classical regime of the higher dimensional theory , we use the abelian field strength and ignore the @xmath41 terms in the yang - mills action .",
    "the modified maxwell equations obtained from our action are , @xmath42 +      \\frac{n^{2}\\,d^{abc}}{128\\pi^{2}\\sqrt{-g } }      \\varepsilon^{\\mu\\lambda\\nu\\rho\\sigma}f^{b}_{\\lambda\\nu}f^{c}_{\\rho\\sigma }      = 0 .\\ ] ]    in order to simplify our task , let us turn on a constant , homogeneous background magnetic field , @xmath13 , in the 4d theory and discuss charge diffusion on this background .",
    "turning on @xmath43 in 4d means imposing a boundary condition that the 5d field strength approach @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that these equations support a constant magnetic field in the three space - like dimensions perpendicular to the branes , @xmath45 we will neglect the backreaction of this field on the background metric .",
    "this is justified when @xmath46 .",
    "later on , we will work in @xmath47 gauge and make use of a partial fourier decomposition of the @xmath48 into plane waves parallel to the horizon with dependence on the fifth coordinate left explicit : @xmath49 throughout , we will use the notation @xmath50 in addition , we will make the assumptions @xmath51 and @xmath52 which in the end are seen to be consistent with the modified diffusion equation we obtain",
    ".    the solution to the field equations describing a constant homogeneous magnetic field , together with the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) , defines the 5d classical background about which we linearize in small perturbations .",
    "the linearized maxwell equations become : @xmath53 -        \\frac{n^{2}\\,d^{abc}}{16\\pi^{2}\\sqrt{-g}}b^{b}_{i}f^{c}_{ti } = 0 ,   \\label{eq : rad}\\ ] ] @xmath54 +       \\frac{n^{2}\\,d^{abc}}{16\\pi^{2}\\sqrt{-g}}b^{b}_{i}f^{c}_{5i } = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath55 -       \\frac{n^{2}\\,d^{abc}}{16\\pi^{2}\\sqrt{-g}}b^{b}_{i}f^{c}_{5 t } = 0.\\ ] ]    in a theory with anomaly , the definition of current becomes ambiguous .",
    "we shall require that all currents be gauge invariant under the abelian subgroup of @xmath37 singled out by the magnetic field .",
    "thus , we employ the regularization where anomalies appear only in r - charge currents for which no external gauge field is turned on . in this regularization",
    "the divergence of an anomalous current is  @xcite : @xmath56 in ref .",
    "@xcite the radial maxwell equation , ( [ eq : rad ] ) is found to function as a conservation equation for the membrane paradigm currents . in our case , we define currents for which the radial maxwell equation serves as the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly equation , ( [ eq : anom ] ) . ultimately , we will show that when we take @xmath57 to define the currents for our system , equation ( [ eq : anom ] ) is properly satisfied .",
    "one can already see that when @xmath58 these currents are conserved by the maxwell equation .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : constit ] ) is a modification to fick s law , arising from the presence of the chern - simons term in the action .",
    "we now embark on our study of linearized perturbations about our solution",
    ". our general strategy will be to demonstrate the same two essential facts in  @xcite .",
    "first , as a direct result of incoming wave boundary conditions at the horizon @xmath59 second , in the hydrodynamic regime @xmath60 our analysis differs from @xcite - and not only by our inclusion of new terms in the equations of motion and our accommodation of a background @xmath13 field .",

    "above , we demonstrated an anomalous modification of constitutive relations in a strongly coupled conformal field theory with a gravitational dual .",
    "we now turn to theories at weak coupling and argue that the same modification should also appear there , and explain its physical origin .    to keep the discussion simple , let s consider the theory a massless fermion . to have a hydrodynamic behavior at finite temperature",
    "the fermion should interact with itself , but we shall assume the interaction to be arbitrarily weak .",
    "in accordance to the discussion in the previous section , we turn on a background gauge field coupled to the fermion current , @xmath129 let us emphasize again that @xmath130 is only a background gauge field ; we do not include a dynamical u(1 ) gauge field into the theory .",

    "the same analysis we just used can also be applied in determining the electric current at equilibrium , in the presence of a non - zero chemical for the axial charge @xmath174 and homogeneous background @xmath175 . just as in the case of @xmath1 sym",

    "we find that enforcing the correct behavior of the retarded two point functions in the zero momentum limit constrains the coefficients of the constitutive terms to be exactly as they are in our two specific cases above .",
    "doing that we assume the theory to contain no massless excitations that could cause the retarded two point functions to be divergent at exactly zero energy and small momentum .",
    "specifically , this will mean that no goldstone modes or massless , dynamical gauge fields can be present .",

    "we will work with a toy model containing two global charges , one vector and one axial - vector , participating in an anomaly with the same background ( vector ) magnetic field . because there are only two global currents participating in the anomaly in this system",

    "first , we will take @xmath197 and note that in this limit , the retarded correlator becomes an analytic continuation of the euclidean time ( or matsubara ) two point correlator  @xcite .",
    "now , taking @xmath198 we note that @xmath199_{\\rm av}$ ] is well defined",
    ". to examine the momentum dependence of our hydrodynamic @xmath200_{\\rm av}$ ] it will be convenient to separate the momentum into components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "writing @xmath201 we find , @xmath202_{\\rm av } =     ( \\frac{p_{\\parallel}}{(p^{2}_{\\parallel}+p^{2}_{\\perp } ) } )    \\frac{ic_{\\rm a}b(\\sigma+\\frac{\\eta}{c_{\\rm a}}d_{\\rm v})}{d_{\\rm v}d_{\\rm a}}.\\ ] ] observe , that if we take @xmath198 along a contour that keeps the ratio @xmath203 constant , the value of @xmath204_{\\rm av}$ ] will be entirely dependent upon what the value of @xmath203 is .",
    "thus , the limit is not well defined , unless the numerator itself is zero .",
    "the only way this can happen in the context of our hydrodynamic equations , is for the following equality to hold : @xmath205 taking the same limits for @xmath206_{\\rm vv}$ ] returns the susceptibility , as it should , and gives no information about @xmath207 or @xmath208 .",
    "the constant @xmath208 can be found by repeating the same steps using only a non - zero @xmath209 , and examining @xmath206_{\\rm va}$ ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this analysis follows through for more general sets of vector and axial - vector currents as well .",
    "the currents are fluxes of global charges , of the form @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the generators , in flavor space , of the symmetries giving rise to each charge .",
    "( we will use early latin indices for vector current generators , and late latin indices for axial current generators , for clarity in what follows . ) in general , we can expect @xmath213 \\ne 0 $ ] , @xmath214 \\ne 0 $ ] , and @xmath215 \\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "the applied magnetic field couples only to one of the vector charges , which we specify here by the index @xmath183 . in this case",
    ", symmetry will demand that new constitutive terms have the forms , @xmath216 the equations of motion to be solved will now be matrix equations in the space of the global charges denoted by \\{@xmath217,@xmath182}. again , one finds that in order for the infrared limit of the two point functions to behave properly , @xmath218 must hold for each possible value of @xmath217 , and @xmath27 , while @xmath219 holds for each @xmath182 and @xmath220 , in the presence of @xmath221 .",
    "this line of argument applies regardless of the coupling strength of the theory under consideration .",
    "it would be nice to get a look at the kind of effect our modified hydrodynamics could have in a real physical system .",
    "one case in which transport behavior in a magnetized system with anomaly may be of interest is hot qcd in a strong magnetic field  @xcite ,  @xcite .    we will take a look at chiral qcd with three massless flavors , in the presence of a homogeneous background @xmath222 magnetic field",
    "this theory possesses an axial anomaly coupling the electromagnetic ( @xmath223 ) , baryon ( @xmath183 ) , and chiral em ( @xmath224 ) currents . to be explicit ,",
    "we write these currents in terms of the diagonal generators of @xmath225 : @xmath226 where , @xmath227 there are two more currents diagonal in flavor which may be defined as @xmath228 with @xmath229 these currents have hydrodynamic behavior , and are anomalous , but their hydrodynamic equations do not couple to the other currents , since @xmath230=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , we ignore them .",
    "the anomaly structure generates non - vanishing three point functions of the types , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 .    in order that we be able to apply the methods of the last section , it is important that we take the system to be above the temperature at which the chiral phase transition takes place , so that no pion modes will be present to couple to the chiral current .",
    "furthermore , we must treat the @xmath233 coupling as arbitrarily small , so the effects of dynamical gauge fields will be negligible .",
    "corrections due dynamic electromagnetic fields would be of order @xmath234 . under these conditions ,",
    "the electromagnetic current is diffusive , rather than ohmic .",
    "leptons are considered as absent .",
    "thus , all three currents are carried only by quarks , and will have identical diffusion constants .",
    "if we apply the methods of the last section to this model , and again work only to first order in the applied magnetic field , we find the following set of coupled hydrodynamic equations .",
    "( to keep notation tidy , we will use @xmath235 where @xmath175 is the standard magnetic field . )",
    "@xmath236 we take the electric field to be zero here .",
    "thus all three charges are conserved . passing to momentum space",
    ", we find a relatively simple eigenvalue equation for the dispersion relations , @xmath237 clearly , for modes in which the momentum is perpendicular to the magnetic field , the dispersion will be purely diffusive .",
    "this will also be the case , when @xmath238 , regardless of orientation .",
    "modes with momentum parallel to the magnetic field will exhibit more interesting behavior .",
    "specifically we find the new ( normalized ) eigenmodes to be , @xmath239 with dispersion relations , @xmath240 frequency eigenmodes are a mixture of currents defined in equation  ( [ cdef ] ) , and the eigenfrequencies now have a real component with the same form as the dispersion of alfven waves .",
    "( the asymptotic value of @xmath241 may be substituted in , if exact numbers are desired . )",
    "an interesting effect of this result , is that an over density of @xmath242 will give rise to a dissipationless flow of this charge along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we have revisited the familiar `` level crossing '' picture of the impact of a chiral anomaly on the non - interacting limit of a weakly coupled gauge theory .",
    "there , we saw that the currents participating in the anomaly are altered in a certain way , in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field : @xmath243 .",
    "we have examined the hydrodynamics of a strongly coupled ( and strongly thooft coupled ) plasma using the gauge - gravity duality as a tool .",
    "there , we saw the r - symmetry currents of large @xmath0 , @xmath1 sym receive a new term in their constitutive relations , due to their participation in the anomaly : @xmath244 .    there is a general symmetry argument for the inclusion of such terms in the constitutive relations of any anomalous local quantum field theory . in the absence of massless modes coupling to the relevant currents",
    ", we have a means of determining the coefficients of these terms by demanding consistency between hydrodynamics and linear response theory in the zero momentum limit .",
    "thus , we conclude that , in the presence of static magnetic fields , the hydrodynamic constitutive relations of an anomalous qft receive a contribution , of the form @xmath245 with a coefficient of @xmath246 times a geometric factor that can be read off from an anomaly equation .",
    "this holds regardless of coupling strength , and so long as their are no massless dynamical modes coupling to the currents involved .",
    "if this lrt treatment can be extended to systems with massless modes , it would be possible to consider anomalous contributions to magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "this is an interesting topic for future work , that may significantly broaden the applicability of the considerations raised in this paper .",
