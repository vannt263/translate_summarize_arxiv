    "this paper is the second of two detailing an observational study of spiral structure for galaxies in the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings - kennicutt et al .",
    "this work also builds directly on an earlier study of m81 presented in kendall et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in the first paper ( kendall et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter paper i ) , the methods and results from individual galaxies were presented together with a comparison between those galaxies in which grand design spiral structure was detected and those that lacked such structure . in this paper",
    "we focus on the subset of @xmath1 galaxies ( henceforth the ` detailed sample ' ) in which it has been possible to characterise the properties of the spiral structure in detail and present an analysis of any trends within this sample .",
    "observational results have been crucial to the advances in the study of spiral structure , and the launch of the _ spitzer _ space telescope provided a new resource in its high quality infrared data .",
    "this paper aims to build on previous studies in the optical and infrared , and provides a new dataset against which numerical simulations of spiral structure can be tested .",
    "there have been numerous observational studies of spiral structure , some key results are as follows : schweizer ( 1976 ) analysed six galaxies using optical data to produce profiles of surface brightness against azimuth . from these data",
    "schweizer concluded that there must be an old disc component in the spiral arms of each of the galaxies studied and that the spiral arms reach amplitudes as large as 30 per cent relative to the disc .",
    "other studies have confirmed this result ; the measured ratio of arm to disc mass varies with galaxy and the exact method and wavelength used , but as a rule the contrast between arm and inter - arm regions in the optical is in the range 20 to 100 per cent ( e.g schweizer ( 1976 ) ; elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1984 ) ; grosbol et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) , with more recent studies suggesting that an upper limit of 40 to 50 per cent is appropriate in the majority of cases ( note that contamination from star forming regions can cause this quantity to be over - estimated particularly in the early studies which used the _",
    "i _ band rather than near infrared ( nir ) data ) .",
    "the amplitude of spiral arms is potentially important since it might be expected to directly affect the global star formation rate ( sfr ) in the galaxy : larger contrasts between the stellar arm - interarm regions are expected to cause the gas to shock more strongly , become more dense , and thus increase the star formation ( bearing in mind that according to the kennicutt - schmidt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) , star formation varies as @xmath2 . )",
    "this association between star formation and spiral structure would appear to be borne out in cases like m81 and m51 , where the vast majority of star formation lies on well defined spiral arms .",
    "some studies have attempted to correlate the rates of star formation with the strength of the stellar spiral arms : for example , cepa & beckman ( 1990 ) found that star formation is triggered preferentially by spiral arms ( with a ` non - linear dependency ' ) .",
    "seigar & james ( 1998 ) found a link between sfr measured from far - infrared luminosity and _ k _ band arm strength , and found that the sfr increases with arm strength .",
    "similarly , seigar & james ( 2002 ) reported that the spiral arm strength ( in _ k _ ) correlates with h@xmath3 ( a sfr tracer ) suggesting that stronger potential variations ( and associated shocks ) lead to a larger sfr ( up to a limiting threshold , above which the sfr is constant ) .",
    "nevertheless , the picture does not always appear to be this simple : studies of flocculent galaxies showing underlying m=2 spiral structure in the mass density as traced by near infrared emission ( elmegreen et al .",
    "1999 , thornley 1996 ) clearly show that star formation is not always preferentially located on two well defined spiral arms .",
    "more recently elmegreen et al ( 2011 ) analysed nir imaging for a sample of nearby galaxies from the spitzer s@xmath4 g survey ( sheth et al .",
    "2010 ) and found that the distinctions between grand design and flocculent arm structures seen in the visible extend to the nir structure as well .",
    "another property of spiral galaxies that has been extensively studied is the pitch angle ( i.e. the angle between spiral features and the tangential direction ) : kennicutt & hodge ( 1982 ) measured pitch angles and compared them against theoretical predictions from both qsss ( quasi - stationary spiral structure - lindblad 1964 ; lin & shu 1964,1966 ) and sspsf ( stochastic self - propagating star formation - mueller & arnett 1976 ; gerola & seiden 1978 ) theories and found qualitative trends that were in agreement with both theories but poor detailed agreement in both cases .",
    "similarly , kennicutt ( 1981 ) compared pitch angle against rsa type ( largely dependent on disc resolution ) , and found a good correlation on average , but with a large degree of scatter . a correlation between pitch angle ,",
    "_ i _ , and bulge - to - disc ratio was also found , where a larger pitch angle ( more open spiral pattern ) is associated with a smaller bulge fraction ; again there is a large scatter in the pitch angle at given bulge to disc ratio .",
    "in addition the maximum rotational velocity was found to correlate strongly with pitch angle , with galaxies with large rotational velocities having more tightly wound spirals .    however , there are indications that the appearance of spiral arms in the nir and optical do not always correlate ( an extreme case being the optically flocculent galaxies with nir arms already noted above ) .",
    "some studies using nir data ( e.g. seigar & james ( 1998 ) have not found the same trends as kennicutt .",
    "block & wainscoat ( 1991 ) found evidence that the spiral arms are less tightly wound in the nir than the optical .",
    "likewise , block et al .",
    "( 1994 ) compare the nir and optical morphology for a sample of galaxies and , for a number of spirals , found significant differences between the pitch angles of the arms in the optical and nir .",
    "they found that galaxies generally appear to be of an earlier hubble type when viewed in the nir ( _ k _ band ) than in the optical , the traditional wavelength for such classifications . on the other hand",
    ", more recent studies have found a generally good agreement between the pitch angles measured in the nir and b band ( seigar et al .",
    "2006 , davis et al .",
    "2012 ) ; in the few cases where the two values are significantly different , there is a mild preference for the nir pitch angles to be larger .",
    "turning now to correlations with galactic parameters , seigar & james ( 1998 ) found no evidence of a correlation between nir pitch angle and bulge fraction or hubble type .",
    "seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) however reported a convincing connection between pitch angle in the nir and the morphology of the galactic rotation curve , with open arms correlating with rising rotation curves , while pitch angles decline for flat and falling rotation curves .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use the new measurements of the properties of the underlying _ stellar _ spiral arms from paper i to re - examine the degrees to which the strengths and shapes of these arms are driven by the structural and environmental properties of their host galaxies .",
    "this is done mainly by examining correlations between the amplitude and pitch angles of the stellar arms with measures of galaxy morphology ( independent of spiral structure ) and mass , and with a measure of tidal perturbation from nearby companion galaxies .",
    "the same data are also used here to compare the shapes of the stellar arms with those traced by young gaseous and stellar components , and to constrain the degree to which the response of the gas discs and the local star formation rates are influenced by the amplitude of the spiral perturbation in the stellar discs .",
    "the data and methods used in this work are described in detail in paper i. a brief summary is as follows ; 3.6 and 4.5@xmath5 m nir data from the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) are used in conjunction with complementary optical data in order to trace the stellar mass .",
    "in addition , irac 8@xmath5 m data are used to trace the gas response , with particular emphasis on shocks .",
    "the data were analysed using azimuthal profiles ( defined from fitting isophotal ellipses to the axisymmetric components of the galaxies ) or radial profiles in the case that difficulties were encountered using azimuthal profiles .",
    "azimuthal profile data were further examined by calculating the fourier components in order to examine the amplitude and phase of individual modes , particularly the m=2 component .",
    "this fourier analysis was not possible for radial profile data ; instead the total amplitude and phase were analysed . in this paper",
    "we consider only the @xmath1 galaxies that constituted the so - called ` detailed sample ' discussed in paper i. we list various properties of these galaxies ( which we go on to correlate with the properties of their spiral structure ) in table 1 .",
    "the methods developed to isolate , identify , and parametrise the massive stellar arms are not well suited to strongly barred galaxies ( which can distort arm shapes very significantly from a logarithmic shape ) , so this paper focuses mainly on normal and weakly barred galaxies ; the role of bars in spiral structure is another important question awaiting further study ( see elmegreen et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         despite these caveats , figure 17 demonstrates that the amplitude of spiral responses does indeed correlate positively with the tidal @xmath6 parameter ( in fact figure 17 shows a more convincing correlation than any of the other plots we present here ) . the fact that @xmath7 galaxies have @xmath8 and yet display a significant spiral pattern implies that tidal interaction _ is clearly not a pre - requisite _ for inducing spiral structure ( and indeed we have seen in paper i that at least half the sample of galaxies without detected grand design structure have @xmath6 values of @xmath9 or above ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure 17 presents convincing evidence that where there is strong interaction the _ amplitude of spiral structure is enhanced_. we have seen that the pitch angles of such ` induced ' spirals are indistinguishable from spiral patterns in apparently isolated galaxies .",
    "we have also seen that where we have tentatively identified trends in the amplitude of spiral features ( i.e. the positive correlations with @xmath10 and stellar mass shown in figures 4 and 5 and the mild anti - correlation with gas content shown in figure 10 ) then the strongly interacting galaxies ( i.e. those with @xmath11 ) roughly follow these trends but at enhanced amplitude .",
    "once again , we however caution against over - interpretation given our limited sample size .",
    "[ hubb_m3m2 ]    [ hub_pitch2 ]    [ rotgrad_amp2 ]",
    "the first half of this paper studied the effects of galaxy type , morphology and environment on the stellar spiral structure .",
    "however , as well as being influenced by the galaxy , a global spiral is expected to influence the galaxy in which it is located .",
    "the following section considers the effect of the spiral on the structure of the gas and the distribution of star formation in galaxies .",
    "here we briefly recapitulate the results of paper i with regard to the location of shocks in the gaseous component ( as traced by @xmath12 m emission ) with respect to the spiral in the stellar mass density ( as traced at @xmath13 m ) .",
    "of the @xmath1 galaxies in the detailed sample considered here , @xmath14 galaxies ( ngc 2403 , ngc 2841 , ngc 6946 , ngc 7793 ) exhibited a flocculent response at @xmath12 m so it is not possible to talk meaningfully about the azimuthal alignment between the spirals manifest in the gas and the stars . amongst the remaining @xmath15 galaxies",
    "there is a general tendency for the @xmath12 m spiral to be located on the trailing ( concave ) side of the stellar ( @xmath13 m ) spiral , i.e. ( at radii inwards of corotation ) being _ upstream _ of the stellar spiral .",
    "moreover the @xmath12 m spiral is generally somewhat more tightly wound .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated in the case of ngc 3031 ( m81 ) where the azimuthal offset increased systematically with radius and whose behaviour was the subject of detailed analysis in kendall et al .",
    "four other galaxies ( ngc 3184 , ngc 3198 , ngc 3938 and ngc 4579 ) also demonstrated evidence of a systematic increase of offset angle with radius . in the remaining cases ,",
    "the scatter in azimuthal offset is sufficiently large to prevent the identification of an obvious radial trend .",
    "the possible significance of an upstream azimuthal offset between the shock in the gas and the maximum stellar density is discussed in kendall et al .",
    "a scenario that predicts such an offset ( with magnitude increasing with radius ) is the case of a rigidly rotating spiral mode whose lifetime is sufficiently long to permit the gas to achieve a steady state flow in the imposed potential . in this case",
    "the solutions of roberts ( 1969 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1972 ) predict that the gas shocks upstream of the gas inwards of corotation , with the magnitude of this offset increasing with radius , a result that has been verified through hydrodynamic simulations ( gittins & clarke 2004 ) .",
    "kendall et al . ( 2008 ) used these results to infer the corotation radius in ngc 3031 and obtained a value that is in reasonable accordance with other estimates in the literature .",
    "on the other hand , clarke & gittins ( 2006 ) and dobbs & bonnell ( 2008 ) undertook hydrodynamic simulations of gas in the case that the stellar potential derived from a high resolution re - simulation of the n - body calculations reported in sellwood & carlberg ( 1984 ) . notably in these simulations with a ` live ' galactic potential , the gas shocks tended to trace the regions of instantaneous maximum stellar density and exhibited no systematic azimuthal offset with respect to the stellar spiral .",
    "a clear difference between this simulation and the idealised case involving a single long lived spiral mode is that , in the n - body calculations , spiral features come and go on a timescale of a few orbits .",
    "clarke & gittins related the gas morphology in this case to the fact that the gas did not have time to adjust to a steady state configuration on the timescale on which individual spiral features established and dissolved . in the case of spiral structure induced by a strong galactic encounter ( as in the modeling of m51 - ngc 5194 - by dobbs et al .",
    "2010 ) no azimuthal offset was found between the gas and stellar spirals .",
    "how do these theoretical results relate to the range of results that we find in our sample ?",
    "we can divide our sample ( as detailed above ) into @xmath14 galaxies with flocculent @xmath12 m structure , @xmath16 with evidence for a systematic upstream offset with magnitude broadly increasing with radius and the remaining @xmath14 as having no simple offset pattern ( we denote these groups f(locculent ) , r(egular ) and c(omplex ) : see paper i for the phase diagrams on which this classification is based .",
    "we find no systematic differences between the galactic properties in these three groups apart from the fact that all the galaxies in the f(locculent ) category are isolated ( @xmath8 ; see table 2 ) ; the r(egular ) and c(omplex ) galaxies occupy a wide range of @xmath6 values , although notably the galaxy which is undergoing by far the strongest interaction ( ngc 5194 ) is in the c(omplex ) category , in line with the simulations of this encounter by dobbs et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "we conclude from this that many of the isolated galaxies exhibit the kind of gas response seen in simulations based on live galactic potentials and that the most strongly interacting galaxy also agrees with simulations inasmuch as it exhibits no clear offset ; the r(egular ) group however exhibit a trend suggestive of a more long lived spiral pattern .",
    "we re - emphasise that this group is heterogeneous in terms of its galactic properties . to date",
    "there has been no detailed quantitative study of how tightly the offset data can be used to constrain the lifetime and nature of spiral structure in simulations .",
    "in addition to the position of the shock , it is instructive to look at the strength of the gas shocks as a function of the strength of the stellar spiral , since a larger spiral amplitude is expected to trigger a larger shock .",
    "we compared these properties for all galaxies in the sample , not just those for which the offset work was carried out .",
    "in contrast to the stellar mass maps , the gas response can not be normalised by an axisymmetric component , so instead we simply divide the 8@xmath5 m azimuthal profile into ` on ' and ` off ' arm regions ; ` on ' arm is defined as being angles @xmath17 of the m=2 peaks ( ` off ' arm is the other @xmath18 degrees , in two arcs ) .",
    "the response is calculated by taking the ratio of the highest peaks in the ` on ' arm region to the average ` off ' arm flux .",
    "note that we use azimuthal profile data for analysis of the @xmath12 m emission for all galaxies in the sample , including those whose amplitude at @xmath13 m is obtained through radial profile analysis .",
    "m gas shock strength indicator ( defined as the average of the four highest peaks in the 8@xmath5 m profile in the ` on ' arm region , normalised by the average value of the 8@xmath5 m profile in the ` off ' arm region ) plotted against average m=2 amplitude at @xmath13 m .",
    "see figure 2 for an explanation of the symbols.,width=313 ]    m excess ratio ( see text for definition ) .",
    "see figure 2 for an explanation of the symbols.,width=313 ]    figure 18 shows the trends in the gas response as a function of m=2 amplitude and show that , as expected , the gas response will tend to be stronger for a larger stellar wave amplitude .",
    "( note that we expect such a correlation to be weakened somewhat by the fact that @xmath12 m pah features may be depleted by the strong uv emission associated with the enhanced star formation in shocked gas . )      in this section we apply the same method as in section 4.1.2 to define ` on ' and ` off ' arm regions , using the _ spitzer _ mips ( rieke et al . 2004 ) 24@xmath5 m wavelength as a tracer of star formation ( calzetti et al .",
    "@xmath19 m emission is dominated by reprocessed radiation from young massive stars as demonstrated by its excellent spatial correlation with other diagnostics associated with such stars ( see relano & kennicutt 2009 for such a demonstration in the case of h@xmath3 emission in m33 ) .",
    "helou et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that the stellar continuum contributes at most a few per cent at @xmath19 m    in figure 19 we plot the ratio of the _ excess _ emission at 24@xmath5 m in the arm compared with the inter - arm region ( where the excess is defined as the mean emission levels in that region minus the minimum emission level in that radial ring : note that in the case of the @xmath12 m data this minimum level is essentially zero in many regions and so in contrast figure 18 presents the ratio of unsubtracted values . )",
    "figure 19 is qualitatively similar to figure 18 and shows a clear dependence of the star formation response ( as measured at @xmath19 m ) and the amplitude of variations in the stellar potential .",
    "the levels of contrast can be used to interpret figure 11 , noting that the dispersion in specific star formation rates and in the @xmath19 m excess ratios are comparable .",
    "this suggests that strong spiral structure can contribute significantly to the dispersion in specific star formation rates in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be the only driver since there are some notable counter - examples ( for example , ngc 3031 with its strong @xmath19 m excess ratio and low specific star formation rate .",
    "by far the strongest correlation that we have identified ( figure 17 ) is between the _ amplitude _ of spiral structure and the strength of tidal interaction as measured by the @xmath6 parameter ( equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "we conclude - in line with our conclusions in paper i - that a close tidal encounter appears to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for prominent spiral features .",
    "ngc 3198 is a good example of a galaxy that is unbarred and isolated and yet shows the ` grand design structure ' that permits its inclusion in the detailed sample studied in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude of its spiral features is admittedly lower than the strongly interacting galaxies in our sample and moreover the @xmath20 mode is less dominant than in these galaxies .",
    "we have indicated the galaxies with the three largest values of @xmath6 ( the strongly interacting galaxies ) by the large crosses in all the other correlation plots .",
    "these galaxies are not atypical for the sample with regard to their pitch angles and the radial extent of spiral structure ( as measured by the azimuthal angle subtended by the arms in figures 8 and 9 ) and so do not strongly influence these plots .",
    "they are however all rather massive and gas deficient galaxies of type sbc or earlier and we must therefore be mindful that apparent correlations may be driven by this association",
    ". this may be particularly relevant to the interpretation of figures 4 , 5 and 10 .",
    "our sample covers a rather narrow range of pitch angles and it is thus unsurprising that we have not identified any correlations between pitch angles and other galactic parameters .",
    "figure 12 may throw some light on previous comparisons between the pitch angles of spiral structure in the optical and nir : for example in the most recent and sophisticated analysis of this issue by davis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) there is generally good agreement between pitch angles in the b and i bands .",
    "discrepant galaxies have a tendency to have larger pitch angles at longer wavelengths .",
    "figure 12 ( which compares nir pitch angles with pitch angles measured in h@xmath3 , an optical star formation indicator ) suggests that in our sample a discrepancy of this sign is evident only for earlier hubble types .",
    "this would suggest - if borne out in larger samples - that an association between early hubble types and tightly wound arms may only be manifest in the optical ( clarke et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the most discrepant galaxies ( ngc 3031 and ngc 4579 ) this difference in pitch angles can be explained by our previous demonstration ( kendall et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ) that in these galaxies the spiral pattern traced at @xmath12 m in shocked gas is significantly displaced upstream with respect to the nir ( stellar ) arms . in a differentially rotating galaxy",
    "it would then be expected that the spiral traced by star formation indicators should be more tightly wound than the stellar arms .",
    "the origin of azimuthal offsets is discussed in our previous papers ; it is currently unclear whether there is a more general association between such offsets and galaxies of early hubble type .",
    "we also draw attention to the other strong correlation that we have found , i.e. the demonstration in figures 18 and 19 of a clear dependence of the amplitudes of spiral structure in star formation ( @xmath19 m ) and shock ( @xmath12 m ) tracers on the amplitude of potential variations as traced in the nir .",
    "the amplitude of spiral structure at @xmath19 m demonstrates that the star formation within the arms can not on its own account for all the variation in specific star formation rate exhibited by the galaxies in our sample and there are indeed objects with strong arm contrast yet low specific star formation rates .",
    "however the range of arm amplitudes at @xmath19 m suggest that variation of strength of spiral features plays a significant contributory role in setting the specific star formation rates in disc galaxies .",

    "<S> this paper presents a detailed analysis of two - armed spiral structure in a sample of galaxies from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) , with particular focus on the relationships between the properties of the spiral pattern in the stellar disc and the global structure and environment of the parent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> following paper i we have used a combination of spitzer space telescope mid - infrared imaging and visible multi - colour imaging to isolate the spiral pattern in the underlying stellar discs , and we examine the systematic behaviours of the observed amplitudes and shapes ( pitch angles ) of these spirals . in general , </S>",
    "<S> spiral morphology is found to correlate only weakly at best with morphological parameters such as stellar mass , gas fraction , disc / bulge ratio , and v@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to weak correlations with galaxy structure a strong link is found between the strength of the spiral arms and tidal forcing from nearby companion galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to support the longstanding suggestion that either a tidal interaction or strong bar is a necessary condition for driving grand - design spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> the pitch angles of the stellar arms are only loosely correlated with the pitch angles of the corresponding arms traced in gas and young stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the strength of the shock in the gas and the contrast in the star formation rate are strongly correlated with the stellar spiral amplitude .    </S>",
