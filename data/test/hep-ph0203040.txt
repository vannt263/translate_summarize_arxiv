    "because of its nonperturbative nature , studying low energy hadron physics in qcd is a long standing difficult problem . for low lying pseudoscalar mesons ,",

    "the coefficients in the lagrangian are all unknown phenomenological parameters which should be determined by experimental inputs .",
    "the number of unknown parameters increases rapidly with the increase of the precision in the momentum expansion .",
    "therefore studying the relation between the chiral langrangian and the fundamental principles of qcd will not only be theoretically interesting for a deeper understanding of the chiral lagrangian , but will also be helpful for reducing the number of unknown parameters and increasing the predictive power of the chiral lagrangian .    in a previous paper , ref.@xcite , certain techniques were developed , with which the chiral lagrangian was formally derived from the first principles of qcd without taking approximations .",

    "<S> we calculate the coefficients in the chiral lagrangian approximately from qcd based on a previous study of deriving the chiral lagrangian from the first principles of qcd in which the chiral lagrangian coefficients are defined in terms of certain green s functions in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , the anomaly part contributions to the coefficients are exactly cancelled by certain terms in the normal part contributions , and the final results of the coefficients only concern the remaining normal part contributions depending on qcd interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we then do the calculation in a simple approach with the approximations of taking the large-@xmath0 limit , the leading order in dynamical perturbation theory , and the improved ladder approximation , thereby the relevant green s functions are expressed in terms of the quark self energy @xmath1 . by solving the schwinger - dyson equation for @xmath1 , we obtain the approximate qcd predicted coefficients and quark condensate which are consistent with the experimental values .    </S>",
