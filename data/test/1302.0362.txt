    "oscillatory behaviour is observed in a great variety of biochemical systems , over a wide range of time periods @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have been modelled extensively , using both deterministic and stochastic frameworks @xcite .",
    "most of this modelling is carried out at the single cell level . however , many processes display coherent behaviour over a population of cells .",
    "this requires that the oscillations in the individual cells must influence each other .",
    "one reason for this is that random fluctuations , intrinsic to these systems , can introduce random phase lags .",
    "this means that a population of isolated cells demonstrating oscillatory dynamics will not remain synchronised over time , even if they are synchronised initially .",
    "therefore , for coherent , collective behaviour ( such as intercellular signalling ) , some form of communication between the cells is necessary .    before proceeding further we need to discuss what is meant by the term ` synchronisation ' .",
    "this is necessary to do this since its precise definition varies . for the stochastic time series of the kind that will interest us here",
    ", the approach of pikovsky , rosemblum & kurths will be the most relevant .",
    "they define synchronisation as `` an adjustment of rhythms of oscillating objects due to their weak interaction''@xcite . using reaction systems as examples",
    ", we will show the forms that the interaction can take , and what ` weak ' means in this context .",
    "one place in which the role and mechanisms of synchronisation have been systematically analysed is the study of the dynamics of glycolytic metabolism .",
    "al . _ have performed experiments in yeast cells , and observed oscillations both in individual cells and populations of cells @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that the coupling of the cells _ via _ an extracellular metabolite ( proposed to be acetaldehyde ) causes the oscillations of the individual cells to synchronise . in @xcite ,",
    "two cell populations , originally oscillating @xmath0 out of phase , became synchronised upon coupling , and a time to synchronise was measured .",
    "several mathematical models have attempted to capture and explain this behaviour .",
    "one of these is due to wolf & heinrich , devised in @xcite and refined in @xcite .",
    "they begin by describing a deterministic , one - cell model , where the cell is connected to an extra - cellular compartment , which exhibits either a stable fixed point or a stable limit cycle , depending on the values of the reaction parameters .",
    "wolf & heinrich then extended the model to @xmath1-cells , where the cells are coupled by exchanging molecules with a shared extra - cellular compartment . in @xcite , the authors show that in a two - cell model , synchronisation with either zero - phase or non - zero phase lag is observed , depending on the reaction parameters chosen . following the experiments by richard _ et .",
    "_ , the authors also mixed two populations of cells which , before mixing , were internally synchronised but out of phase with the other population .",
    "wolf & heinrich found that , once mixed , the two populations did indeed synchronise , although this took considerably longer to achieve than it did in the experiments .",
    "this may suggest that the form of the coupling , or the chemical species chosen to be responsible for the coupling , may not be the correct one . in many models",
    "it has been found that the form of the coupling chosen in the model can significantly alter the dynamics observed , as found in @xcite .",
    "another system in which synchronisation is often studied involves oscillations in the concentration of adenosine 3 , 5-cyclic monophosphate ( @xmath2 ) in the amoeba _ dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite .",
    "these social amoeba feed on bacteria in the forest soil . during the onset of starvation ,",
    "the cells alter their behaviour to aggregate , and become able to relay @xmath2 signals , in the form of oscillations . in this way",
    ", populations of the _ dictyostelium _ cells form large aggregates .",
    "this process culminates with the formation of a fruiting body which can disperse spores , leading back to the start of the life cycle @xcite .",
    "one reason why this is much studied is that many of the components involved in the @xmath2 signalling have corresponding components in mammalian pathways , hence the desire to understand this system in more detail @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present an approach to the investigation of synchronisation in models of biochemical processes which is analytic and where the models are stochastic in nature .",
    "the vast majority of studies of such systems found in the literature are described by systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which show limit cycle behaviour .",
    "however it is now well established that stochastic effects will be significant even in systems containing a large number of molecules @xcite .",
    "stochastic oscillations will not only occur at a single frequency , as for limit cycles , and this will have consequences when investigating synchronisation of these oscillations .",
    "what studies there have been of synchronisation of stochastic oscillations have been purely numerical @xcite , and have not considered the possibility of phase lags between oscillations in different cells .",
    "however , the key aspects of synchronisation in stochastic biochemical models become particularly clear when an systematic analytical treatment is given .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : method ] we will introduce the formalism we shall be using and give a simple example to illustrate its use . a model of @xmath2 oscillations in _ dictyostelium discoideum _",
    "will be analysed in section [ sec : dict ] , to show the application of our methods to a more realistic , multi - cell model .",
    "in particular , we show under which conditions a phase lag between oscillations in neighbouring cells is introduced .",
    "we end with a summary and suggestions for further work .",
    "in this section we will describe the formulation of the process in terms of a stochastic model , and then go on to describe the methods we use to see if synchronisation occurs .",
    "fortunately , the quantities we need to calculate to investigate the question of synchronisation are the same as those required to study stochastic oscillations , and so in many cases much of the calculation will already have been carried out .",
    "the reaction system is described by a chemical master equation , which is written in terms of the integer populations of the chemical species present in the model , which we write as @xmath3 , if there are @xmath4 species present in the model .",
    "this describes the time evolution of the probability for the system to be in state @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , which is written as @xmath7 .",
    "transitions from one state to another are caused by the chemical reactions .",
    "we write @xmath8 as the transition rate from state @xmath5 to state @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the stoichiometric vector corresponding to reaction @xmath11 .",
    "the master equation then has the general form @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{master}\\ ] ]    to make progress analytically , an approximation scheme must be employed .",
    "the crudest scheme is to ignore fluctuations completely , and simply write down an equation for the average @xmath13 in the limit where both the number of molecules in the system and its volume , @xmath14 , becomes large , we describe the system in terms of the concentrations of the chemical species , @xmath15 . from eqs .",
    "( [ master ] ) and ( [ average ] ) one finds the macroscopic , deterministic , equation for @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined by @xcite @xmath19 it is straightforward to calculate the function @xmath20 from the chemical reactions and the reaction rates , and so we can determine whether at large times the system tends to a fixed point , a limit cycle , or some other , more complex , type of behaviour",
    ".    however , as mentioned already , oscillations seen in biochemical reactions may be stochastic in nature , and so not be described by the deterministic equation ( [ macroscopic_eqn ] ) . to study these",
    "we can not completely ignore the dynamics of the fluctuations contained in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "the simplest way of doing this is to simply include stochastic effects ( or ` noise ' ) as linear deviations from the deterministic result .",
    "this is the linear noise approximation ( lna ) and is especially simple to implement if the system has reached a stationary state which corresponds to a fixed point of the deterministic equation ( [ macroscopic_eqn ] ) .",
    "the lna then consists of working with the variables @xmath16 , writing them as @xmath21 .",
    "the lna assumes that @xmath14 is large , so we keep only linear terms in @xmath22 when they are substituted into the master equation ( [ master ] ) . here",
    "the asterisk signifies a fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ macroscopic_eqn ] ) and the @xmath23 reflects the gaussian nature of the approximation @xcite . the equation satisfied by the linearised fluctuations @xmath24 is found to be ( for details , we refer the reader to the literature @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a gaussian noise term with zero mean and with correlator @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is the jacobian at the fixed point and the matrix @xmath29 can be calculated in the same way that the function @xmath30 was : @xmath31    since eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) describes fluctuations about the stationary state and is linear , we can analyse the equation using fourier transforms . denoting the temporal fourier transform of @xmath32 as @xmath33 , we may write eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "this then allows us to calculate the power spectral density matrix ( psdm ) @xmath36 in earlier work on analysing the nature of the stochastic oscillations about a fixed point , only the diagonal entries of this matrix ( the ` power spectra ' @xmath37 ) were of interest @xcite .",
    "here we shall also be interested in the off - diagonal entries , but as mentioned in the introduction , if eq .",
    "( [ psdm ] ) has been calculated so as to obtain the power spectrum , the off - diagonal elements can be immediately read - off .",
    "an application quite similar to the one we are discussing here is that described by rozhnova _ et .",
    "al . _ who used the off - diagonal elements to show how stochastic oscillations can become synchronised @xcite",
    "they constructed an epidemiological model of a network of cities , where a disease can be transported between cities due to movement of infected commuters .",
    "we will use a similar approach but instead of cities and people , we will work with cells and molecules .",
    "unlike the diagonal elements  the power spectra  the off - diagonal elements of the psdm will in general be complex . often , these elements are normalised , by using the relevant power spectra .",
    "this quantity is then known as the complex coherence function ( ccf ) @xcite , @xmath38    as this is a complex function , it can be expressed in terms of a magnitude and a phase , @xmath39 @xmath40=\\textrm{arctan}[\\frac{\\textrm{im } ( p_{ij}(\\omega))}{\\textrm{re}(p_{ij}(\\omega ) ) } ] .",

    "the phase of the ccf tells us the phase lag between two signals as a function of the frequency @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "for example , if the two signals are in phase the ccf will be a real function . to clarify the use of these concepts",
    "we apply them to a simple example .",
    "the biochemical reaction scheme we will use to illustrate the methodology is a toy system , but many more complex reaction schemes contain molecular species which behave in this way .",
    "the system consists of two species @xmath30 and @xmath29 , which may both lose molecules through diffusion out of the cell and also gain them through diffusion into the cell .",
    "species @xmath30 requires molecules of species @xmath29 to sustain its numbers , and they become depleted when too many @xmath29 molecules have been used up .",
    "this is essentially a predator - prey dynamics , and we will use this language to discuss it , since it makes the results more intuitive .",
    "the sustained stochastic oscillations have been previously investigated using the formalism described in section [ sec : formalism ] @xcite .",
    "the actions of these species is described by the following interactions and their corresponding transition rates :    @xmath42    the variable @xmath43 is introduced to give the system a maximum carrying capacity , which is the ` size of the system ' @xmath44 .",
    "that is , the total number of individuals at any time is fixed , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the numbers of @xmath48 and @xmath43 molecules in the cell . because of this we will use @xmath44 as the large parameter employed in the lna in this example .",
    "we have also only allowed for species @xmath30 to diffuse out of the cell , and for species @xmath29 to diffuse in ( subject to existing concentration ) .",
    "the relation @xmath49 has been used to simplify the transition rates above .    applying the methodology described in section [ sec : formalism ] ,",

    "i.e. _ if the system - size is small ( and therefore the fluctuations are relatively large ) , is the synchronisation of two oscillators observed if the magnitude of the corresponding ccf has low or intermediate value ?",
    "such questions we leave for the future . our aim here has been to formulate the analytic study of synchronisation of stochastic oscillators in a biochemical context , and to illustrate its use in a specific model .",
    "we hope that this will encourage others use these techniques to investigate other biochemical systems .",
