    "neutron star cooling is an important tool for the study of dense matter . by comparing cooling models with observations of thermal emission from these objects , we can gain insight into the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter , the signatures of exotic particles , superfluid energy gaps , and magnetic field properties [ for a recent review , see @xcite ] .",
    "a neutron star loses the thermal energy with which it was born initially through neutrino emission , and later through photon emission , the change between these two stages occurring about @xmath0 yr after birth .",
    "several heating mechanisms may become important during late stages of the evolution of a neutron star , most of them related to the delayed adjustment to the progressively changing equilibrium state as the rotation slows down .",
    "these include the dissipation of rotational energy due to interactions between superfluid and normal components of the star @xcite and release of strain energy stored by the solid crust due to spin - down deformation @xcite .",
    "another of these mechanisms is _ rotochemical heating _",
    "@xcite , which has its origin in deviations from beta equilibrium due to spin - down compression .",
    "as a neutron star spins down , the centrifugal force acting on each fluid element diminishes , changing the local value of the pressure . since the composition of",
    "neutron star matter in beta equilibrium is a one - parameter function , this compression results in a displacement of the equilibrium concentration of each particle species .",
    "reactions which change the chemical composition are in charge of driving the system to the new equilibrium configuration .",
    "but if the rate at which reactions do this task is slower than the change of the equilibrium concentrations due to spin - down compression , the system is permanently out of chemical equilibrium .",
    "this implies an excess of energy , which is dissipated by enhanced neutrino emission and heat generation .",
    "after its introduction , this heating mechanism was studied by several authors : @xcite applied it to quark stars , @xcite made an order - of - magnitude estimate of the effects of superfluidity , and @xcite studied the heating due to compositional transitions in the crust due to spin - down compression .",
    "all studies agree that rotochemical heating is particularly important for old neutron stars with fast rotation and low magnetic fields , features that are characteristic of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the most striking prediction associated with rotochemical heating is that , if the spin - down timescale is substantially longer than any other timescale involved ( with the likely exception of magnetic field decay ) , the star arrives at a _ quasi - equilibrium state _ , in which the temperature depends only on the current , slowly changing value of @xmath1 ( the product of the angular velocity and its time derivative ) , proportional to the spin - down power , and not on the star s previous history @xcite .",
    "this provides a simple way to constrain the physics involved in theoretical models , once the spin parameters and observed surface temperature of a msp are known .    although the qualitative behavior of the thermal evolution of neutron stars with rotochemical heating is known , all previous studies made only order - of - magnitude estimates , ignoring the spatial structure of the star and thus not offering reliable predictions to be compared with observations .",
    "also unknown is the dependence of the thermal evolution on eos and stellar mass .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the thermal evolution of msps with rotochemical heating , taking the structure of the star fully into account in the frame of general relativity , and using realistic eoss of dense matter . in order to do so",
    ", we develop a general formalism to treat the evolution of the temperature and departures of chemical equilibrium . as a first approach",
    ", we have chosen the simplest possible core composition , namely neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons ( @xmath2 matter ) , to see if we can explain observations with it , before invoking exotic particles .",
    "the main difficulty of treating the spatial structure of the star is the lack of an expression for the spin - down compression in the frame of general relativity .",
    "we develop such an expression with the aid of the slow - rotation approximation of @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical situation to be modelled is the stage after the accretion - driven spin - up of the pulsar has finished .",
    "although it is generally believed that crusts and cores of neutron stars have superfluid components ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in this work we ignore superfluidity .",
    "our plan is to make an extensive study of rotochemical heating in non - superfluid stars and compare results with observations , in order to assess whether invoking superfluidity ( whose parameters are currently very uncertain ) is necessary to explain observations .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in  2 , we develop our general formalism , as well as the expression for the spin - down compression rate . in  3 , we detail the input necessary for numerical calculations ( eos , reactions , heat capacities , etc . ) . in  4 , we describe our results , comparing our predictions with the recent detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from the nearest msp , psr j0437 - 4715 @xcite , and the lack of optical emission from the even closer `` classical '' pulsar psr j0108 - 1413 @xcite .",
    "we also list some other msps for which the rotochemical heating luminosity might become detectable .",
    "a short summary of our main conclusions is given in  5 .",
    "it is conventional in neutron star cooling calculations to divide the star into two regions : a nearly isothermal _ interior _ , which ranges from the center out to density @xmath3 g @xmath4 , and a thin _ envelope _ , which ranges from @xmath5 to the surface and where a strong temperature gradient exists @xcite . since we are modelling the thermal evolution of a msp long after accretion has stopped , it is safe to assume that thermal relaxation from an initial non - uniform internal temperature profile has already occurred , so that the redshifted internal temperature , @xmath6 is uniform ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the time component of the metric of a non - rotating reference star , of which @xmath8 is the radial spherical coordinate .",
    "although spherical symmetry is broken for a rotating star , we describe the latter as a perturbation to the corresponding non - rotating star ( with the same total baryon number ) .",
    "we establish a lagrangian correspondence between the surfaces of constant @xmath8 in the non - rotating star with the constant - pressure surfaces of its rotating counterpart , on which all local thermodynamic quantities will be shown to be constant ( see   [ sec : perturbation ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the internal temperature is given by the thermal balance equation @xcite , which for an isothermal interior is given by @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the total heat capacity of the star , @xmath11 is the total power released by heating mechanisms , @xmath12 is the total neutrino luminosity , and @xmath13 is the photon luminosity .",
    "these quantities are calculated as @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath15 is the proper volume element , @xmath16 is the specific heat ( heat capacity per unit volume ) of each particle species , @xmath17 is the total neutrino emissivity contributed by reactions , @xmath18 is the total heating rate per unit volume , @xmath19 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath20 is the stellar coordinate radius , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the effective radius as measured from infinity , and @xmath23 the redshifted effective temperature .",
    "the surface temperature @xmath24 is obtained from the internal temperature by assuming an envelope model @xcite .",
    "since the neutrino emissivity and heating rate are modified when the neutron star is out of chemical equilibrium @xcite , the evolution of the temperature depends on how strongly it departs from the beta equilibrium state . for @xmath2 matter",
    ", this departure can be quantified by the chemical imbalances @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the deviation from the equilibrium chemical potential of species @xmath27 , at a given pressure . since diffusion timescales are short compared with the evolutionary timescales to be considered @xcite , we assume uniform redshifted chemical potential deviations throughout the core : @xmath28 to obtain the time evolution of the chemical imbalances , we start by writing down the chemical potential of each particle species as a function of the number density of all particles : @xmath29 .",
    "we assume small departures from chemical equilibrium , which can be expressed by requiring that @xmath30 . in this approximation ,",
    "the departures from the equilibrium particle number densities @xmath31 are related to the @xmath32 by @xmath33 where the partial derivatives are evaluated at the beta equilibrium state . to eliminate the effect of particle diffusion between different regions of the star , we integrate equation  ( [ eq : dni_dmui ] ) over regions where free particles exist . after integration",
    ", we obtain the deviation from the equilibrium number of particles @xmath34 as a function of the redshifted chemical potential lags : @xmath35 with @xmath36 where we have used equation  ( [ eq : delta_mu_infty ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath37 do not depend on time , we invert and take the time derivative of equation  ( [ eq : dni_dmui ] ) , obtaining the evolution of the @xmath38 : @xmath39 the rate of change of @xmath34 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the change in the total number of particles of species @xmath27 due to reactions @xcite . here , @xmath42 is the net creation rate of particles of species @xmath27 per unit volume due to reaction @xmath43 .",
    "it can be checked that the @xmath44 satisfy baryon number and charge conservation .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is the change in the equilibrium value of the total number of particles of species @xmath27 , which depends on the spin - down compression rate .",
    "we defer its calculation to the next subsection .",
    "the evolution of the redshifted chemical imbalances @xmath46 follows from equations  ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , ( [ eq : eta2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : delta_mu_infty ] ) : @xmath47 equations  ( [ eq : dot_t ] ) , ( [ eq : dot_eta1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : dot_eta2 ] ) give a complete description of the thermal evolution of a neutron star with rotochemical heating and @xmath2 composition , given an expression for @xmath45 .      for slow enough rotation frequencies , the deviation of the star from the non - rotating configuration can be treated as a small perturbation , which we describe in terms of a lagrangian formalism . using the fact that the total baryon number @xmath48 of a star is conserved",
    ", we can describe its interior in terms of surfaces of constant pressure @xmath49 enclosing a fixed number of baryons @xmath50 ( e.g. , the surface @xmath51 encloses @xmath48 baryons inside it ) . as the stellar rotation rate changes",
    ", these surfaces will readjust their shapes , with a corresponding change in @xmath49 , but keeping @xmath50 constant . since there is a one - to - one relation between the enclosed number of baryons @xmath50 and the radial coordinate of the non - rotating configuration @xmath8 ( for fixed @xmath48 ) , we use them interchangeably to identify a given surface , relating them by @xmath52 .",
    "the underlying assumption is that , on a surface of constant pressure , the other thermodynamical quantities are also constant .",
    "this is straightforward for neutron - star matter in beta equilibrium ( described by a barotropic equation of state ) , but not so obvious for departures from this state ( which are not necessarily barotropic , as the pressure - density relation will also depend on the local particle abundances ) .",
    "we show in appendix  [ sec : gradients ] that , in a uniformly rotating , perfect - fluid star in hydrostatic equilibrium , surfaces of constant pressure coincide with those of constant energy density and gravitational redshift , regardless of whether the equation of state is barotropic .. ] this , together with diffusive equilibrium ( uniform redshifted chemical potentials everywhere in the stellar interior ) , ensures that the chemical composition on each surface is also constant .",
    "to quantify the spin - down compression rate and thus @xmath53 , we need an expression for the change in pressure with rotation frequency on each surface enclosing a constant @xmath50 , keeping @xmath48 constant .",
    "@xcite developed a perturbative approach in the frame of general relativity , relating quantities on rotating and non - rotating stars with the same central energy density @xmath54 ( but , therefore , different @xmath48 ) , by expanding the metric of an axially symmetric non - rotating star in even powers of the angular velocity @xmath55 .",
    "this perturbative approach is valid for stars rotating at frequencies much smaller than the kepler frequency @xmath56 , at which mass shedding from the equator occurs .",
    "for realistic equations of state , this limiting frequency can be well approximated by means of empirical formulae @xcite .",
    "the corresponding kepler periods , @xmath57 , are lower than the shortest msp periods measured to date [ see , e.g. , the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite ] .",
    "our task is to express our spin - down compression rate at constant @xmath48 in terms of hartle s results , which assume constant @xmath54",
    ".    if the baryon number enclosed by a surface of constant pressure @xmath49 in a rotating star is @xmath58 , some partial - derivative manipulation yields @xmath59 where the subscripts denote quantities which are kept constant in carrying out the differentiation .",
    "we note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are just @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , evaluated at the surface of the star ( @xmath51 ) . also , since we are perturbing around the non - rotating configuration , we can evaluate all the derivatives at @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite found that the lowest - order change in a given stellar property with rotation is linear in the squared angular frequency @xmath65 , for a star with fixed central density .",

    "the left panel displays results obtained for different eoss , with fixed central pressure , while the right panel shows results for different stellar models and fixed eos .",
    "as expected , the expression is negative , since spin - down compression means increase in @xmath49 with decrease of @xmath65 .",
    "compression is strongest at the center of the star .",
    "it can be shown that the central value is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the adiabatic index , and the subscripts @xmath93 mean central values . since @xmath94 for the maximum mass non - rotating configuration , the divergence of the result for @xmath95 , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : dpdomega2 ] , is easy to understand .",
    "the graphs confirm the order - of - magnitude expression @xmath96 which implies that the perturbation is small as long as @xmath97 .    with our expression for the spin - down compression rate at hand , we can write the change in the equilibrium number of particles of species @xmath27 with time as @xmath98 where the derivative @xmath99 is calculated in beta equilibrium .",

    "in other cases , such as a star with a core of deconfined quarks of fairly uniform relative abundances , the phase transition may dominate the heating .    in order to maintain diffusive equilibrium , a finite number of particles per unit time , @xmath106 ,",
    "must be brought to ( or , if negative , away from ) the phase transition much faster than the latter progresses due to the spin - down of the star .",
    "therefore , a phase transition is the place where our assumption of diffusive equilibrium is most strongly put into question .",
    "however , in the case of interest to us , the low temperatures ( implying long mean - free paths and therefore fast diffusion ) and the extremely slow evolution should still validate this approximation .",
    "@xcite has shown that , due to the presence of two separate conserved charges ( baryon number and electric charge ) , phase transitions in neutron stars may not occur as a single discontinuity , but instead through a mixed phase , in which both phases coexist over a finite range in pressure ( or stellar radius ) . in this case , any discontinuities would be considerably weakened , if not fully eliminated , and we do not expect any special effects ( such as discussed above ) associated with the phase transitions .",
    "to implement the formalism of  2 numerically for the non - superfluid case , we need as input an eos , neutrino emissivities , a specific heat , and an envelope model .",
    "we then have to calculate the stellar structure and the corresponding integrals over the star .      since our formalism requires a detailed knowledge of the structure of the star , we need an eos to determine the spatial dependence of the thermodynamical quantities by solving the relativistic stellar structure equations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual variables given in most published eoss ( pressure , energy density , chemical composition , and adiabatic index , all evaluated in chemical equilibrium ) , we need to know the partial derivatives of equation  ( [ eq : dni_dmui ] ) ( which are easy to compute if we know the energy density or energy per baryon of interacting particles as a function of baryon number density and proton fraction ) and the baryon effective masses for computing reaction rates and heat capacities",
    ". we also want to cover a broad range of eoss , in order to assess the dependence of the quasi - equilibrium temperature on their properties .",
    "given our requirements , we have used three sets of eoss :    1 .",
    "the two most realistic eoss from @xcite ( apr ) for the core , supplemented with that of @xcite and @xcite , for the inner and outer crust , respectively ; 2 .   five representative eoss from @xcite ( bpal ) for the core , with the same eoss for the inner and outer crust as for the previous set ; and 3 .   a non - interacting fermi gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the whole star .",
    "in table  [ tab : eos_par ] we list , for each eos , the mass @xmath83 , central energy density @xmath54 , coordinate radius @xmath20 , and effective radius as seen from infinity @xmath107 of the maximum - mass non - rotating configuration .",
    "since in the apr set the thermodynamical quantities are obtained from an analytical fit to tabulated many - body calculations @xcite , care has to be taken when interpreting results obtained for densities higher than the highest tabulated value , since extrapolation can lead to significant errors .",
    "this is the reason why we do not list the maximum - mass configuration for the a18 + @xmath108 eos .",
    "another feature of this set is that the a18 + @xmath108 + uix * eos becomes non - causal at densities greater than @xmath109 , which is the central density of a star of @xmath110 , slightly below the maximum mass formally allowed for this eos , @xmath111 .",
    "however , this eos is considered to be the state of the art among those derived from non - relativistic potentials , since it incorporates three - nucleon interactions and relativistic boost corrections @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will in what follows take it as our reference eos .",
    "the eoss of the bpal set are labelled according to @xcite , who characterize them by the different magnitude of their nuclear incompressibility and density dependence of their symmetry energy .",
    "the values for the fermi gas eos listed in table  [ tab : eos_par ] correspond to a central density slightly below the appearance of @xmath112 hyperons .",
    "the a18 + @xmath113 + uix * eos has an additional feature : a phase transition associated with the appearance of a neutral pion condensate at a density @xmath114 g @xmath4 . in order to connect the normal phase with the pion - condensed one",
    ", we assumed a maxwell transition , which implies a discontinuity in all thermodynamical quantities but the temperature , pressure and neutron chemical potential , resulting in an energy - density jump of 6.6% .",
    "@xcite also considered the possibility of a mixed - phase transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) , concluding that ( for a standard , @xmath115 neutron star ) the shell containing the mixed phase is only @xmath116 m thick .",
    "they also estimated the debye screening length of electrons to be smaller than the characteristic size of structures ( by a factor 6 - 12 ) , which would favor the maxwell transition as a better approximation to the real situation @xcite .",
    "also listed in table  [ tab : eos_par ] are the kepler periods @xmath117 corresponding to most of the eoss , which are necessary in order to determine the extent to which the slow - rotation approximation holds for treating the spin - down compression .",
    "the apr and pal values were computed with the empirical formula of @xcite .",
    "this gives , for each eos , the maximum allowed rotation frequency in terms of the mass and radius of the maximum - mass non - rotating configuration .",
    "the accuracy for non - causal eoss is somewhat lowered from its optimal value of 1.5% @xcite , which applies for a18 + @xmath118 + uix*. the reason why the entry corresponding to a18 + @xmath108 is empty is that its maximum mass configurations occur at a central density which requires substantial extrapolation , making the empirical formula an unreliable estimator of @xmath57 . for the fermi gas eos , we adopt the exact value calculated for a pure neutron gas by @xcite , since the empirical formula of @xcite does not work for this case .",
    "so far , the fastest known msp is psr b1937 + 21 , with a period of 1.56 ms @xcite , which is about three times longer than kepler periods for all realistic eoss .      since we are not taking superfluidity into account , direct and modified urca reactions are the dominant neutrino emission mechanisms .",
    "we have therefore neglected additional neutrino emission processes in the core and the crust of the star , and ignored possible modifications in urca rates due to the neutral pion condensate of the apr set ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "away from beta equilibrium , neutrino emissivities and net reaction rates per unit volume of urca - type reactions in non - superfluid matter are given by @xcite @xmath119 respectively , where @xmath120 is the neutrino emissivity in equilibrium due to reaction @xmath43 , @xmath121 is the chemical imbalance affected by reaction @xmath43 , @xmath122 is the local temperature , @xmath70 is the baryon number density , @xmath78 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are dimensionless control functions which depend on whether the reaction is of direct of modified urca type .",

    "we may ask here if this choice is a good approximation for computing the evolution of the chemical imbalances , since the short diffusion timescale limit means that the chemical equilibrium everywhere in the star can be restored by reactions occurring wherever these are fastest .",

    "although they did not consider neutron diffusion between different layers in the star , and modelled the spin - down compression as a one - dimensional process , we take their result to suggest a very small contribution to the total heating .",
    "since the inner crust accounts for about 2% of the total baryons in the star and",
    "the neutrino emissivities of the core overwhelm crustal emission processes , we integrated equations  ( [ eq : bij_def ] ) only over the core and neglected processes in the crust , under the assumption that the error introduced would be small .",
    "our results confirm our assumption , since for the more realistic eoss we obtained heating rates due to core processes much bigger than iida & sato s results ( see equation [ eq : ratio_edot ] ) .",
    "we have to warn that neglecting the crust may not be a good approximation if superfluidity is included , since non - equilibrium processes in the crust can even overtake suppressed urca reactions in the core .",

    "the reason is that the limit @xmath208 implies that reactions are completely determined by chemical imbalances , eliminating any dependence on internal temperature .",
    "the energy released is divided in fixed fractions between neutrino emission ( @xmath209 = 3/8 $ ] ) and heating ( @xmath210 ) , the latter being radiated entirely as photons .",

    ", we may ask how their presence could modify the thermal evolution . the first particles to appear after muons are probably the @xmath224 and @xmath225 hyperons , which require the introduction of two additional chemical imbalances : @xmath226 once hyperons are present , the following non - leptonic reactions are open ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath227 reaction ( [ eq : nnsp ] ) proceeds via weak interactions , since it does not conserve strangeness , while ( [ eq : nnln ] ) proceeds via strong interactions . both reactions",
    "have timescales several orders of magnitude shorter than beta processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , imbalances ( [ eq : eta_nnsp ] ) and ( [ eq : eta_nl ] ) remain small compared to @xmath228 and @xmath229 , and reactions ( [ eq : nnsp ] ) and ( [ eq : nnln ] ) contribute negligibly to the total heat generation . moreover , since chemical imbalances associated to direct or modified urca reactions with hyperons are linear combinations of @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 , the latter two will determine the heat generation through both nucleon and hyperon reactions .    in order to assess the importance of including the urca processes involving hyperons in addition to the nucleon processes ,",
    "consider , as an example , the @xmath112 direct urca reactions @xmath232 whose associated chemical imbalance is @xmath233 .",
    "their net effect on equations  ( [ eq : evolucion_eta1 ] ) and ( [ eq : evolucion_eta2 ] ) is to enhance the electron direct urca rate according to @xmath234 , reducing the chemical imbalance and thus the stellar surface temperature .",
    "this correction is small , since direct urca reactions with hyperons are at least a factor 5 weaker than their nucleon analogs @xcite . for the pure modified urca case",
    ", it can be checked from equation  ( [ eq : l_gamma_qe ] ) that the correction to the surface temperature introduced by adding several reactions involving hyperons is a factor @xmath235^{1/28}$ ] , where @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the nucleon and hyperon urca luminosities , respectively .",
    "thus , the corrections due to hyperons in a purely modified urca or purely direct urca scenario are fairly negligible .",
    "the only important effect of hyperons in the context of rotochemical heating is that , in their presence , conditions for direct urca processes may become more easily satisfied , as is the case with reactions involving @xmath238 @xcite .",

    "his conclusion was that a necessary condition for the quasi - equilibrium solution to be a good approximation to the exact one is that the spin - down timescale has to be longer than that for the growth of chemical imbalances . to quantify this , we estimate the spin - down timescale as the characteristic age , @xmath247 and take the ratio of @xmath248 to it , getting @xmath249 figure  [ fig : evol_chiteqvarios ] shows the internal temperature of our conventional star after the rise from the minimum temperature , for different initial values of @xmath48 , with fixed initial @xmath248 .",

    "since this object satisfies @xmath271 with small @xmath48 , we assume that it is already at the quasi - equilibrium state . in figure",

    "is reached if only modified urca reactions are present .",
    "when direct urca reactions open , there are two abrupt drops in @xmath272 with increasing stellar mass , the first one ( @xmath275 ) due to electron direct urca , and the second ( @xmath276 ) due to muon direct urca .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : ts_rinf ] for the curves calculated with bpal11 and a18 + @xmath108 + uix * , as examples of only electron direct urca , and in the curves corresponding to bpal32 and bpal33 , which have electron and muon direct urca .",
    "perfect agreement could be obtained by allowing masses within @xmath277 of the maximum - mass non - rotating configuration , for the eoss with only modified urca .",
    "however , we consider this scenario very unlikely .    using the eoss which have only modified urca reactions within the allowed mass for psr j0437 - 4715 , we can constrain the predicted effective temperature to the narrow range @xmath278 k , about 20% lower than the blackbody fit of @xcite .",
    "there are three possible reasons why we are not matching their results :    1 .",
    "we are not taking superfluidity into account .",
    "this would reduce urca reaction rates , lengthening the equilibration timescale and raising the quasi - equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "we are neglecting other heating mechanisms ( some of them directly related to superfluidity ) , which could further raise the temperature at any stage in the thermal evolution . nonetheless , in msps , all proposed mechanisms are less important than rotochemical heating @xcite .",
    "3 .   the thermal spectrum could deviate from a blackbody , in the same way as the isolated neutron star rx j1856 - 3754 , which has a well - determined blackbody x - ray spectrum that underpredicts the optical flux @xcite , indicating a more complex spectral shape of its thermal emission .",
    "kargaltsev and collaborators stress the fact that psr j0437 - 4715 , despite its much larger spin - down age , has a higher surface temperature than the upper limit for the younger , `` classical '' pulsar j0108 - 1431 , @xmath279 k , inferred from the optical non - detection by @xcite . in this regard , we note that the spin - down power ( @xmath280 ) of the latter pulsar is 680 times lower than that of j0437 , making rotochemical heating substantially less important .",
    "its equilibration timescale , according to equation ( [ eq : tau_eq_def ] ) , is @xmath281 yr , longer than the age of the universe and certainly much longer than the spin - down age of the pulsar .",
    "thus , it is not expected to be even close to reaching its quasi - equilibrium state ( although it is old enough to have lost its initial heat content ) .",
    "its actual temperature should therefore be substantially smaller than the predicted quasi - equilibrium surface temperature , which is already @xmath282 times lower than that of j0437 , well below the observational upper limit .      in table",
    "[ tab : predictions ] , we provide predictions of @xmath272 ( assuming modified urca reactions and no superfluidity ) for several msps . since the high - energy part of their expected thermal spectrum is highly absorbed by neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium , we chose to order them by decreasing predicted quasi - equilibrium flux in the low - energy ( rayleigh - jeans ) regime , @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the distance to the object . each @xmath285 entry in table  [ tab : predictions ] is scaled by the value for psr j0437 - 4715 .",
    "the first group of msps after psr j0437 - 4715 are nearby , single msps , for which @xmath285 is expected to be larger than for the binary msps , for which the initial period has been estimated from their white dwarf companion ( see  [ sec : conditions ] ) .",
    "we consider the former as the primary targets for observations analogous to those of @xcite .",
    "however , even for psr j0437 - 4715 , the nearest and brightest msp known to date , the detection of thermal emission is rather difficult , so the observation of other objects of table  [ tab : predictions ] will be a real challenge .",
    "the second group of msps are those with estimates for @xmath268 .",
    "however , their low fluxes make the detection of their thermal emission impossible for current instruments .",
    "optical detections are even more daunting than those in the ultraviolet .",
    "the extrapolated rayleigh - jeans spectrum of psr j0437 - 4715 gives magnitudes @xmath286 , @xmath287 , and @xmath288 , which are completely overwhelmed by the white dwarf companion . the most promising single msps have about three times lower expected fluxes at earth , i.  e. , are another 1.2 magnitudes fainter , beyond the reach of current telescopes .",
    "in this work , we have made an extensive study of the effect of rotochemical heating in non - superfluid millisecond pulsars .",
    "we have set up a general formalism for the thermal evolution in the framework of general relativity , which takes the stellar structure fully into account and can be extended to include both superfluidity and exotic particles . a key ingredient in this formalism is the spin - down compression rate based on the slow - rotation approximation of @xcite .",
    "the main consequence of rotochemical heating is the arrival at a quasi - equilibrium state , in which the effective temperature of a neutron star depends only on the current value of the spin - down power .",
    "we argue that most of the known msps are very likely in the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "if only modified urca reactions are allowed , the quasi - equilibrium bolometric photon luminosity in the non - superfluid case can be well approximated by @xmath289 independent of the neutron star envelope model .",
    "the influence of eos and stellar model on the quasi - equilibrium state is very weak , the only significant factor being the occurrence of direct urca reactions .",
    "if they are open for both muons and electrons , quasi - equilibrium temperatures are low , as in the conventional cooling case .",
    "if they are open only for electrons , the system arrives at a  metastable \" quasi - equilibrium , after which it proceeds as if only modified urca reactions with muons were present .",
    "the highest temperatures are reached when all direct urca reactions are forbidden .",
    "even our highest predicted quasi - equilibrium effective temperatures are lower than the blackbody fit of @xcite to the uv emission of psr j0437 - 4715 by about 20%",
    ". the inclusion of superfluidity will likely raise our predicted temperatures , being the subject of future work .",
    "we thank g.  pavlov and o.  kargaltsev for letting us know about their work in advance of publication and for kindly providing the data for figure  [ fig : ts_rinf ] .",

    "in this appendix , we show that , in uniformly rotating , relativistic stars in hydrostatic equilibrium , composed of a perfect fluid , the surfaces of constant pressure and those of constant energy density coincide , as in the newtonian case , even if the equation of state is not barotropic .",
    "in addition , the gravitational redshift is constant on the same surfaces .",
    "this result , together with the diffusive equilibrium condition , allows us to describe the spin - down compression in terms of lagrangian changes of thermodynamic variables on isobaric surfaces enclosing a fixed baryon number , since all thermodynamical quantities are constant on each isobar . as a by - product",
    ", we also provide an alternative derivation of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for uniformly rotating , relativistic stars .    the assumption a perfect ( i.e. , non - dissipative ) fluid , whose stress - energy tensor depends only on the energy density @xmath81 and ( isotropic ) pressure @xmath49 , is of course not strictly true in the astrophysical situation of interest in this paper , in which entropy is generated by non - equilibrium weak interactions , particle diffusion , and heat conduction , and lost ( from the star ) through the emission of neutrinos and photons .",
    "however , the total energy dissipated ( and eventually lost ) along the star s lifetime is much smaller than that associated with the mass , random motions , and interactions of its particles , as well as its rotation , and the time scale of the release of this energy is many orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical time and the rotation period of the star .",
    "therefore , the contribution of these dissipative processes to the energy and momentum fluxes is extremely small and can be neglected in the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this is in line with the usual approach ( also used in neutron star cooling calculations and in the rest of this paper ) of neglecting thermal effects when calculating the structure of the star , which is regarded as a fixed background on which thermal processes take place .",
    "the metric of a stationary , axially symmetric system can be written in the form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath290 where the metric coefficients are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath82 only .",
    "the components of the 4-velocity of any fluid element of the uniformly rotating star are @xmath291 , and @xmath292 , with @xmath293\\right)^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath294 is the gravitational redshift factor , which corrects the energy of a freely moving particle , as it is measured by observers co - moving with fluid elements on different surfaces inside the star . , where @xmath295 are the covariant components of the particle s 4-momentum . due to the symmetries of the metric",
    ", the expression within parenthesis is conserved along the particle s world line , and is its redshifted energy . ]",
    "the energy - momentum conservation equation can then be written as @xmath296 where @xmath297 are the components of the stress - energy tensor of a perfect fluid . applying to this equation a projection operator orthogonal to the four - velocity , @xmath298 @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath299 since the only non - vanishing terms are those with @xmath300 and @xmath301 taking the values @xmath302 , the relevant connection coefficients are @xmath303 hence , equation  ( [ eq : cons_enmom ] ) yields @xmath304 using equation  ( [ eq : ut_def ] ) , we arrive at the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath305 which is in agreement with the result of @xcite , for the special case of rigid rotation .",
    "this shows that the redshift factor @xmath294 is also constant on the surfaces of constant @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath306 which implies that @xmath81 is also constant on the same surfaces .",
    "in this appendix , we show that each term of the spin - down compression rate , equation  ( [ eq : dpdomega2_final ] ) , is continuous across a phase transition , even if the energy density and baryon number density change discontinuously .",
    "we use units with @xmath307 .",
    "the discontinuous quantities in the derivative @xmath308 , equation  ( [ eq : dndp_def ] ) , are @xmath70 and @xmath88 .",
    "the gibbs free energy per unit volume for @xmath2 matter in beta equilibrium at @xmath309 is @xmath310 since , at a phase transition , the pressure @xmath49 and neutron chemical potential @xmath311 are continuous , the fractional size of the number density jump can be written as @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the positive jump in number density . from the relativistic stellar structure equations , we have @xmath314 the fractional size of the corresponding jump across the phase transition",
    "is @xmath315 thus , from equations  ( [ eq : dn_n ] ) and ( [ eq : ddpdr_dpdr ] ) , we see that the quantity @xmath316 is continuous across a phase transition , and so is @xmath317 .    regarding the derivative @xmath318 , equation  ( [ eq : dndomega2_n0 ] ) , since the jump in @xmath70 is integrated in equation  ( [ eq : n_norot ] ) , @xmath319 is continuous . for @xmath320 , the jump in @xmath70 due to the last term of equation  ( [ eq : n_rot ] )",
    "is cancelled by the contribution from @xmath321 in the integral . using @xmath322 where @xmath301 is dirac s delta function and @xmath323 , with @xmath324 the pressure at which the phase transition occurs",
    ", we can write @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the step function . equation  ( [ eq : disc_dndomega2 ] ) is equal to minus the jump ( increasing @xmath8 ) of the last term in equation  ( [ eq : n_rot ] ) .",
    "finally , for the derivative @xmath327 , the contribution from @xmath328 to the integral in equation  ( [ eq : dndn0_p ] ) cancels out the discontinuity due to @xmath70 in the first term . using @xmath329 where @xmath330 , and @xmath331 the radial coordinate at which @xmath332 , we can write @xmath333 which is the negative of the jump ( increasing @xmath8 ) of the first term in equation  ( [ eq : dndn0_p ] ) , since the sign of @xmath334 is also @xmath335 .    the right panel of figure  [ fig : dpdomega2 ] shows the spin - down compression rate inside the core of several stellar models built with the a18 + @xmath108 + uix * eos , which has a phase transition . the occurrence of the transition can be seen as a ( fairly harmless ) discontinuity in the derivative of each curve .",
