    "the chemical composition of extremely metal - poor stars is expected to reflect the yields from a quite small number of nucleosynthesis processes .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the individual nucleosynthesis processes involved .    the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) is known to be responsible for about half of the abundances of elements heavier than the iron - group in solar system material .",
    "although observational data have been rapidly increasing in the past decade , the astrophysical site of the r - process is still unclear .",
    "previous nucleosynthesis studies suggest several possibilities , e.g. , neutrino - driven winds @xcite or prompt explosions @xcite of core - collapse ( type  ii / ibc ) supernovae , neutron star mergers @xcite , jets from gamma - ray burst accretion discs @xcite .",
    "all the scenarios proposed above involve , however , severe problems that remain to be solved , and no consensus has yet been achieved .",
    "models of the r - process nucleosynthesis are usually examined by comparison with the abundance pattern of the r - process component in solar - system material .",
    "recent measurements for abundances of neutron - capture elements in very metal - poor stars have been providing useful constraints on these models .",
    "@xcite have studied the chemical abundances of the extremely metal - poor star cs  22892052 , the first example of a small but growing class of metal - poor stars that exhibit very large excesses of r - process elements relative to iron ( [ r - process / fe ] @xmath0 ) .",
    "an important result of their work is that the relative abundance pattern of the neutron - capture elements from the 2nd to the 3rd peak ( 56 @xmath1 _ z _ @xmath1 76 ) in this star is identical , within observational errors , to that of the ( inferred ) solar system r - process component .",
    "this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as `` universality '' of the r - process , having a large impact on the studies of the nature of the r - process , and its astrophysical site .    however , the abundance patterns of light neutron - capture elements ( 38 @xmath1 z @xmath1 48 ) in r - process enhanced stars exhibit clear deviations from that of the solar system r - process component @xcite .",
    "this suggests the existence of another r - process site which has contributed to the light r - process elements in solar - system material .",
    "this process is sometimes called as `` weak r - process '' , while the process that is responsible for heavy neutron - capture elements ( ba @xmath2 u ) is referred to `` main r - process '' .    following the previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite and @xcite have investigated the correlation of sr and ba abundances in very metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ) in some detail .",
    "they showed that the dispersion of the sr abundances clearly decreases with increasing ba abundance .",
    "this correlation indicates the existence of ( at least ) two processes : one enriches both heavy and light neutron - capture elements , while the other yields light neutron - capture elements with only small production of heavy ones .",
    "@xcite discuss the contribution of a primary process which has produced light neutron - capture elements in our galaxy .",
    "the abundance patterns produced by the main r - process have been studied previously based on high resolution spectroscopy of metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "by way of contrast , the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements produced by the weak r - process is still unclear .",
    "since the abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements yielded by this process are very low , it is quite difficult to accurately measure their abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "in addition , most spectral lines of light neutron - capture elements , in particular those with @xmath4 exist in the near - uv region , in which atmospheric extinction makes the observation with ground - based telescopes difficult .",
    "we have been investigating light neutron - capture elements in very metal - deficient stars from near - uv spectroscopy with the 8.2  m subaru telescope .",

    "this object has very low abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. [ ba / fe ] @xmath6 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while light neutron - capture elements show large excesses relative to heavy ones ( e.g. [ sr / ba ] @xmath7 ) .",

    "in addition to the cu 5105  and zn 4810  lines , the uv lines ( 3250 - 3350  ) are also used in the abundance analyses ( table [ tab : table1 - 4 ] ) .      although the abundances of sr , y , and zr have been determined by a number of previous studies for hd  122563 , measurements for other light neutron - capture elements are quite limited so far .",

    "we have detected two lines of ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the 3498   line is measurable due to there being no ( apparent ) blend with other lines . since a strong line exists in the bluer region of the other line at 3728   , we applied the spectrum synthesis technique to the analysis of that line .",

    "we note that the n abundance adopted is much lower than those derived by previous works ( e.g.,[n / fe]@xmath7 * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy is partially due to the inaccurate gf - values used in our analysis .",
    "recent studies of n abundances based on nh lines applied corrections of gf - values to the kurucz s list ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the nh lines , some unidentified feature appears in the red part of this line ( figure [ fig : spectra ] ) .",

    "the abundances of ba , la , eu , and yb were derived by a spectrum synthesis technique , taking into account hyperfine splitting .",
    "the abundances of other elements were determined by applying a single line approximation , which is justified by the fact that the absorption lines are quite weak in general .",
    "in addition to the two resonance lines at 4554 and 4934   , two ba lines in the red region were measured .",
    "the line data of @xcite were used for the analysis of ba lines , assuming the isotope ratios of r - process component in solar - system material .",
    "there is a small discrepancy between the ba abundances from the two resonance lines and others .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is the non - lte effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we detected three lines at 3819   , 4129   and 4205   .",
    "however , the 4205   line blends with a line , while the 3819   one is affected by a wing component of a strong fe line at 3820   .",
    "since these eu lines are quite weak in the spectrum of hd  122563 , in contrast to those in r - process enhanced stars , the effect of the blending is significant .",
    "hence , we adopt the result from the 4129   .",
    "we note that the eu abundances derived from the excluded lines , within their relatively large errors , agree with the value from the 4129   line .",
    "the effect of isotope shift for gd lines was included in the analysis by @xcite for the s - process enhanced star cs  31062 - 050 .",
    "this effect is , however , neglected in the present analysis , because the gd lines of hd  122563 are very weak .",
    "we have detected three gd lines ( table [ tab : table1 - 4 ] ) .",
    "the gd abundance derived from the 3481  line is significantly higher than those from the other two , and an upper limit estimated from another line ( 3331   ) .",
    "we regard this as a result of contamination of the 3481   line by some unidentified lines , and exclude this line in the determination of the final gd abundance .",
    "yb is the heaviest element detected in our spectrum .",
    "we measured two yb lines at 3220 and 3694 .",
    "a spectrum synthesis technique was applied to the analysis including the effect of hyperfine splitting for these lines ( sneden et al .",
    "2003 , private communication ) .",
    "agreement of the results from the two lines is fairly good .",
    "the upper limits of ir and th abundances are obtained from the analyses of 3800   and 4019   line .",
    "the line of 4019   is affected by contamination by other lines ( figure [ fig : th ] ) .",
    "we analyzed this line using the line list of @xcite for this wavelength region .",
    "we adopted @xmath28c/@xmath29c = 5 to estimated the blending of @xmath29ch lines .",
    "since the blends of fe and co lines are severe , no clear th feature is identified , although the quality of the spectrum is very high ( s / n = 950 at 4020   ) .",
    "we derived the upper limit of the th abundance ( log @xmath30 ( th ) @xmath31 ) from the fitting of synthetic spectra by eye .",
    "neutron - capture elements have been studied for this object by many authors .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite performed detailed abundance analyses based on high resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath32 ) for this object .",
    "@xcite also determined the abundances of eight neutron - capture elements , though their resolving power ( @xmath33 ) is not as high as those in the above studies .",
    "recently , @xcite derived the abundances of ge , zr , la and eu from the uv region ( 2410 @xmath2 3070   ) of this object using hubble space telescope , and also uv - blue region ( 3150 @xmath2  4600   ) with keck i hires .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows comparisons of the abundances of neutron - capture elements derived by the present analysis with those of previous work .",
    "our results are in good agreement with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . however , the abundances of neutron - capture elements determined by the present analysis are systematically lower than those by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we inspect the discrepancy between the results of @xcite and ours in some detail , because their work determined abundances of a larger number of elements than @xcite , and they reported the equivalent widths used in the abundance analysis for some lines ( unfortunately , the equivalent widths were not given for the lines for which spectrum synthesis technique was applied ) .",
    "the atmospheric parameters adopted in our analysis are in good agreement with theirs : the differences ( our results minus those of @xcite ) of @xmath10 , @xmath13 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath12 are + 70  k , 0.2  dex , 0.07  dex and 0.3  km  s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these differences results in differences of abundances smaller than 0.1 dex for heavy neutron - capture elements ( see table [ tab : error ] ) .",
    "therefore , the difference of the adopted atmospheric parameters is not a reason for the abundance discrepancy .",
    "we also found good agreements in the equivalent widths of the lines reported by both works .",
    "however , the @xmath34 value of the nd 4061   line used by @xcite is lower by 0.25  dex than ours . though the @xmath34 values of la adopted by the two works are quite similar , no information on the treatment of the hyperfine splitting was given by @xcite , while the effect is fully included in our analysis .",
    "we adopted recent line data for @xcite and @xcite , which should be more accurate than those used by @xcite .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the results of the two work might be partially explained by the difference of the adopted line data",

    "in addition , the value of [ la / eu ] of the solar system r - process component is 0.59 , while that in hd  122563 is 0.50 .",

    "the excess of light neutron - capture elements ( e.g. sr ) with respect to the heavy ones ( e.g. ba ) was known for hd  122563 by previous studies ( see section 1 ) . however , the abundances of elements having intermediate mass ( e.g. mo , pd ) were measured in detail for the first time by the present work .",

    "since the s - process abundance pattern in the solar - system is a result of a combination of some individual processes ( at least the weak and main components of the s - process ) , we presume this apparent `` agreement '' is physically not important .",

    "the abundance ratios between light and heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , sr / ba ) in hd  122563 are clearly different from those in r - process enhanced stars , as already mentioned in  1 .",
    "therefore , the r - process responsible for the heavy neutron - capture elements in the solar system ( the so - called `` main '' r - process ) is not an important source of , at least , light neutron - capture elements in hd  122563 .",

    "the abundance pattern of light to heavy neutron - capture elements measured for hd  122563 provides a unique constraint on such model calculations .",
    "the abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements of hd  122563 shows a significant departure from the r - process component in solar - system material , though the departure is not as large as that found for light neutron - capture elements ( figure [ fig : r ] ) .",

    "given the fact that the abundance patterns of heavy elements measured for r - process enhanced stars show excellent agreement with that of the solar - system , the different abundance pattern of hd  122563 must be significant .",
    "some process that produces a different abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements from that of the main r - process is at least required to explain the abundance pattern of this star .",

    "the result is shown by the dashed line in figure [ fig : r+s ] . in this case , the contributions of the s - process to ba , la , and ce are significant ( @xmath2 70% ) , while those to elements heavier than nd are small ( @xmath48 10% ) .",
    "it should be noted that such a small contribution of the main s - process does not affect the abundance pattern of light neutron - capture elements discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the logarithmic abundance difference between the observed and calculated abundance patterns is 0.29  dex for the case that a contribution from the s - process is introduced , compared with 0.34  dex if only the r - process is assumed . thus , the fit is slightly better if an s - process contribution is introduced .",
    "however , the improved fit comes at the cost of an additional free parameter ( the relative contribution of the s- and r - processes ) , and it is not clear that assuming an s - process contribution is justifiable from the point of view of the star s nucleosynthetic history .",
    "in particular , the discrepancy found in the abundance pattern of elements heavier than sm can not be explained by this approach , because the production of such heavy elements by the s - process is very small .",
    "this discrepancy leads us to consider an alternative possibility that the heavy neutron - capture elements of this star are also a result of the unidentified ( single ) process that is responsible for the large enhancement of the light neutron - capture elements discussed in   5.2.1 .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the small ( but non - negligible ) amount of heavy r - process nuclei ( @xmath49 ) with non solar r - process abundance pattern can be produced in neutrino winds if the entropy of the neutrino - heated matter is enough high ( but smaller than that required for the main r - process ) , in addition to the light r - process nuclei .",
    "if this is true , the abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements in this object may give another hint for , or constraint on , the modeling of this process .",
    "the differences between the abundance patterns of heavy neutron - capture elements in hd  122563 and the solar - system r - process abundance pattern are not large .",
    "further observational data are clearly required to derive definitive conclusions .",
    "however , it would be very difficult to improve the measurement of abundances for hd  122563 , because the quality of the spectrum used in the present work is extremely high .",
    "one possibility is to reconsider the atomic line data to reduce the uncertainties in abundance measurements .",
    "another important observational study is to apply similar analysis to other metal - poor stars having high abundance ratios of light to heavy neutron - capture elements . in particular , measurements for stars with lower metallicity than hd  122563 are important , because no s - process contribution is expected for such stars .",
    "we obtained a high resolution , high s / n uv - blue spectrum of the very metal - poor star hd  122563 with subaru / hds .",
    "the abundances were measured for 19 neutron - capture elements , among which seven elements are detected for the first time in this star .",
    "our new measurements for hd  122563 clearly demonstrate that the elemental abundances gradually decrease relative to the scaled solar r - process abundances with increasing atomic number , at least from sr to yb .",
    "we have considered whether the higher abundances of lighter elements can be explained by contributions from the weak s- or main s - processes , and find these not to provide satisfactory explanations .",
    "the abundance pattern of elements with @xmath50 does not agree with any prediction of neutron - capture process models known .",
    "the abundance pattern of a wide range of neutron - capture elements determined for hd  122563 therefore provides new strong constraints on models of nucleosynthesis for very metal - poor stars , in particular those with excesses of light neutron - capture elements but without enhancement of heavy ones .",
    "this work was supported in part by a grant - in - aid for the japan - france integrated action program ( sakura ) , awarded by the japan society for the promotion of science , and scientific research ( 17740108 ) from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology of japan .",
    "most of the data reduction was carried out at the astronomical data analysis center ( adac ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
