    "_ globally coupled maps _ are collections of individual discrete - time dynamical systems ( their _ units _ ) which act independently on their respective phase spaces , except for the influence ( the _ coupling _ ) of a common parameter that is updated , at each time step , as a function of the _ mean field _ of the whole system . systems of this type have received some attention through the work of kaneko @xcite in the early 1990s , who studied systems of @xmath0 quadratic maps acting on coordinates @xmath1 $ ] , and coupled by a parameter depending in a simple way on @xmath2 . his key observation , for huge _ system size _",
    "@xmath0 , was the following : if @xmath3 denotes the time series of mean field values of the system started in a random configuration @xmath4 , then , for many parameters of the quadratic map , and even for very small coupling strength , pairs @xmath5 of consecutive values of the field showed complicated functional dependencies plus some noise of order @xmath6 , whereas for uncoupled systems of the same size the @xmath7 , after a while , are constant up to some noise of order @xmath6 . while the latter observation is not surprising for independent units , the complicated dependencies for weakly coupled systems",
    ", a phenomenon kaneko termed _ violation of the law of large numbers _",
    ", called for closer investigation .",
    "the rich bifurcation structure of the family of individual quadratic maps may offer some explanations , but since a mathematically rigorous investigation of even a small number of coupled quadratic maps in the chaotic regime still is a formidable task , there seem to be no serious attempts to tackle this problem .    a model which is mathematically much easier to treat is given by coupled tent maps .",
    "indeed , for tent maps with slope larger than @xmath8 and moderate coupling strength , a system of @xmath0 mean field coupled units has an ergodic invariant probability density with exponentially decreasing correlations @xcite .",
    "this is true for all @xmath0 and for coupling strengths that can be chosen to be the same for all @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , ershov and potapov @xcite showed numerically that ( albeit on a much smaller length scale than in the case of coupled quadratic maps ) also mean field coupled tent maps exhibit a violation of the law of large numbers in the aforementioned sense .",
    "they also provided a mathematical analysis which demonstrated that the discontinuities of the invariant density of a tent map are at the heart of the problem .",
    "their analysis was not completely rigorous , however , as chawanya and morita @xcite could show that there are indeed ( exceptional ) parameters of the system for which there is no violation of the law of large numbers - contrary to the predictions in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , references @xcite contain further simulation results on systems violating the law of large numbers .",
    "( but at present , a mathematically rigorous treatment of globally coupled tent maps that is capable of classifying and explaining the diverse dynamical effects that have been observed does not seem to be in sight either . )",
    "these studies were complemented by papers by jrvenp @xcite and keller @xcite , showing ( among other things ) that globally coupled systems of smooth expanding circle maps do not display violation of the law of large numbers at small coupling strength , because their invariant densities are smooth .    given this state of knowledge ,",
    "the present paper investigates specific systems of globally coupled piecewise fractional linear maps on the interval @xmath9 $ ] , where each individual map has a smooth invariant density . for small coupling strength ,",
    "theorem 4 in @xcite extends easily to this setup and proves the absence of a violation of the law of large numbers . for larger coupling strength",

    "stable behaviour : :    in the _ stable regime _ , i.e. for fixed small coupling strength below    the bifurcation point of the infinite - size system , the measures    @xmath13@xmath14 converge weakly , as the system size    @xmath15 , to an infinite product measure    @xmath16 , where @xmath17    is the unique fixed point of @xmath10 .",
    "bistable behaviour : :    in the _ bistable regime _ , i.e. for fixed coupling strength above the    bifurcation point of the infinite - size system , all possible weak    limits of the measures @xmath13@xmath14 are convex    combinations of the three infinite product measures    @xmath18 ,    @xmath19 , where now @xmath17 is the    unique unstable fixed point of @xmath10 and    @xmath20 are its two stable fixed points .",
    "( we    conjecture that the measure    @xmath16 is not charged in the    limit . )",
    "this scenario clearly bears some resemblance to the curie - weiss model from statistical mechanics and its dynamical variants .",
    "we also stress that a simple modification of our system leads to a variant where , instead of two stable fixed points , one stable two - cycle for @xmath10 is created at the bifurcation point .",

    "its normalised version @xmath56 is the unique @xmath55-invariant probability density .",
    "the key point in the choice of this family of maps is that for @xmath57 , @xmath55 is steeper in the positive part of @xmath58 than in its negative part , hence typical orbits spend more time on the negative part , which is confirmed by the invariant density ( see figure [ fig : trandhr ] ) . if @xmath59 , then @xmath55 favours the positive part .",

    "existence , uniqueness and exactness of an invariant density were proved essentially by krzyzewski and szlenk @xcite .",

    "<S> we study systems of globally coupled interval maps , where the identical individual maps have two expanding , fractional linear , onto branches , and where the coupling is introduced via a parameter - common to all individual maps - that depends in an analytic way on the mean field of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we show : 1 ) for the range of coupling parameters we consider , finite - size coupled systems always have a unique invariant probability density which is strictly positive and analytic , and all finite - size systems exhibit exponential decay of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) for the same range of parameters , the self - consistent perron - frobenius operator which captures essential aspects of the corresponding infinite - size system ( arising as the limit of the above when the system size tends to infinity ) , undergoes a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation from a unique stable equilibrium to the coexistence of two stable and one unstable equilibrium .    . </S>"
