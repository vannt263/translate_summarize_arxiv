    "with the launch of fermi satellite , one of the new features of gamma - ray bursts at high - energies has been established , i.e. grbs show extended high - energy ( @xmath0 mev ) emission which lasts much longer than the prompt phase .",
    "this extended emission has been seen in both long and short grbs and the flux usually decays with time after the initial peak . in some cases ( e.g. grb090510 and grb090902b ) , the temporal decay is a simple power - law decay with a slope ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b ; ghirlanda , ghisellini , nava 2009 ; de pasquale et al . 2009 ) .",
    "one of the proposed models for such emission is the hadronic cascade emission model , in which the high - energy photons produced by the accelerated ultra - high energy protons can not escape the soft photon field and a cascade is induced ( abdo et al .",
    "this model has been applied to the extended emission of grb941017 ( dermer & atoyan 2004 ) , but whether it can explain the simple power - law decay of the fermi lat bursts is unknown . the long - lived behavior and not very rapid decay of the high - energy emission from grb090510 and grb090902b",
    "can not be easily explained by the reverse shock emission model either ( wang et al .",
    "2001a , b ) ( abdo et al .",
    "2009c ) , which is consistent with the synchrotron self - inverse compton scattering emission from the reverse shock or cross ic scatterings between the reverse shock and forward shock ( wang et al .",
    "2001a , b ; granot & guetta 2003 ; peer & waxman 2004 ; wang et al . 2005 ) . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the simple power - law decay with a modestly large slope is reminiscent of the afterglow emission .",
    "the self inverse - compton ( ic ) emission of the afterglow has been long thought to produce a high - energy component ( e.g. zhang & 2001 ; sari & esin 2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2008 ; gou & 2007 ) , but the light curve is expected to rise initially and start to decay minutes to hours after the burst .",
    "kumar & barniol duran ( 2009a ) proposed that the extended high - energy emission from grb080916c is due to afterglow synchrotron emission .",
    "this mechanism has also been proposed to explain the extended high - energy emission from grb090510 ( gao et al .",
    "2009 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini , nava 2009 ; ghisellini , ghirlanda , nava 2009 , de pasquale et al .",
    "2009 ) and grb090902b ( kumar & barniol duran 2009b ) .    in the latter synchrotron afterglow scenario ,",
    "the high - energy extended emission is produced by the electrons in the forward shock via synchrotron emission .",
    "the shock - accelerated electrons are usually assumed to have a power - law form in energy distribution , i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of electrons .",
    "these electrons also suffer ic loss by scattering synchrotron photons . due to",
    "that the scattering between large @xmath5 electrons and the synchrotron photons could enter the klein - nishina ( kn ) scattering regime , higher energy electrons may suffer smaller ic loss and as a consequence , their synchrotron emission is stronger . since the lorentz factor of the electrons producing",
    "the high - energy afterglow emission are usually large , the kn scattering effect must be taken into account when one calculate the synchrotron high - energy afterglow emission . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of the kn scattering on the high - energy afterglow emission of grbs .",
    "recently , wang et al.(2009 ) studied the kn effect on the prompt emission spectrum of grbs and nakar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied the kn effect on optically thin synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton spectrum in general . in this paper , we focus on the early high - energy afterglow emission and confront the theoretical results with the high - energy afterglow observations by fermi lat .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we study how the kn scattering affects the electron distribution in the forward shock in @xmath6 2 .",
    "then in @xmath6 3 we calculate the compton parameters for the high - energy electrons that produce high - energy gamma - ray emission and study their evolution with time . with the compton parameters known , we calculate the light curves of high - energy afterglows in @xmath6 3 .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in in @xmath6 4 .",
    "we define the compton parameter for electrons with lorentz factor @xmath5 as the ratio of the synchrotron self - inverse compton ( ssc ) to the synchrotron emissivity , i.e. @xmath7 when kn effects are unimportant , i.e. the ic scattering of @xmath5 electrons with synchrotron photons are in the thomson scattering regime , @xmath8 is a constant and its value has been derived by sari & esin ( 2001 ) for the grb afterglow . however , for high energy electrons whose kn effect become important , @xmath8 depends on @xmath5 .",

    "the kn effect can affect the electron distribution , which is given by @xmath15 for the slow - cooling case and @xmath16 for the fast - cooling case respectively ( nakar et al .",

    "1998 ) . to compare with fermi lat observations , we consider the electrons that produce @xmath21 synchrotron photons .",
    "we define @xmath22 as the lorentz factor of those electrons whose synchrotron frequency is @xmath23 .",
    "the electrons producing such high - energy afterglow emission typically have @xmath24 . for the slow - cooling case",
    ", one can derive the number density of electrons of @xmath22 when the kn effect is taken into account , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26\\gamma_*^{-p-1}$ ] represents the number density of electrons of @xmath22 when only the synchrotron cooling is considered ( @xmath27 is the cooling lorentz factor of electrons when only the synchrotron cooling is considered ; see , e.g. sari et al .",
    "therefore the number density of electrons of @xmath22 is a factor of @xmath28 lower than that in the case that only the synchrotron cooling is considered . as a result",
    ", the synchrotron luminosity produced by @xmath22 electrons is reduced by the same factor correspondingly . in the fast - cooling case , when the ic scatterings of electrons of @xmath29 with synchrotron photons are in the thomson scattering regime ( the case of @xmath63.2.2 ) , one can also obtain @xmath30 $ ] , so the the synchrotron luminosity is also reduced by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "now we derive @xmath31 . as the electron distribution is different in the fast and slow cooling cases , we divide the following analysis into these two different cases .      whether the afterglow emission belongs to the slow - cooling or fast - cooling case depends on shock microphysics parameters ( i.e. the magnetic field equipartition factor @xmath32 and electron energy equipartition factor @xmath33 ) and other parameters such as the burst energy @xmath34 and the circumburst density @xmath35 . among these parameters , the magnetic field equipartition factor @xmath32 is the mostly poorly known .",

    "as has been shown in figures 1 and 2 , the compton parameters for the electrons that produce high - energy gamma - ray afterglow emission are typically small at early time @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath180 for a wide range of parameter space .",
    "this has important implication for the detectability of high - energy afterglow emission by fermi lat , since a low @xmath31 leads to a high synchrotron luminosity at high - energies .",
    "the low - energy electrons that produce early x - ray and optical afterglow emission , however , still suffers from the strong ic loss ( i.e. @xmath48 or @xmath156 are typically high ) and therefore the observed early x - ray / optical afterglow luminosity is low , compared with high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath31 also has implication for the temporal decay slope of high - energy afterglow emission .",
    "@xmath31 increases with time and its value could be greater than 1 at late times for some range of parameter space .",
    "this will lead to a faster decay of the high - energy synchrotron afterglow emission , which may explain the early fast decay of the high - energy gamma - ray emission seen in grb090510 and grb090902b .",
    "the fermi lat and gbm observations as well as the swift observations of the short burst grb090510 are reported in abdo et al .",

    "( 2009 ) and de pasquale et al .",
    "the high - energy emission above 100 mev shows a simple power - law decay after the peak , with a decay slope of @xmath181 ( de pasquale et al .",
    "2009 ) or @xmath182 ( ghirlanda et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the xrt and uvot starts to observe this burst from 100 s after the burst .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is @xmath183 and the temporal decay index is @xmath184 during the initial 1000 s and subsequently steepens to @xmath185 with a break at about @xmath186 ks .",
    "the spectrum and temporal decay index of the x - ray emission before @xmath187 is well consistent with the forward shock emission with @xmath188 and @xmath189 , produced by a spherical blast wave expanding in a constant density medium . the steeper decay with a slope @xmath190 after the break is consistent with a jet break model ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) .",
    "such an interpretation predicts a decay slope of @xmath191 at high - energy frequency with @xmath171 in the standard synchrotron scenario , since the different cooling behavior of electrons causes a difference of @xmath192 in the decay slope .",
    "this slope is much shallower than the observed slope .",
    "the high - energy gamma - ray emission observed from the long burst grb090902b by fermi / lat is reported in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "lat detected high - energy gamma - ray emission above 100 mev on time scales much longer than the prompt phase .",
    "the time - integrated spectrum of the lat detected emission after the prompt phase is consistent with @xmath193 .",
    "its flux declines as a simple power - law with a decay slope of @xmath194 from @xmath195 s to 1 ks . taking @xmath196 ,",
    "the standard synchrotron emission predicts a decay slope of @xmath197 , which is shallower than the observed decay slope , similar to the case in grb090510 .",
    "we suggest that one possible origin for the discrepancy in the theoretical and observed decay slopes seen in grb090510 and grb090902b is due to the kn effect on high - energy electrons ( i.e. @xmath198 ) in additional to the fast - cooling spectrum is needed to make the blast wave radiative . ] , as discussed in @xmath64 .    the spectrum of the afterglow emission at high - energies can be changed as well when @xmath31 increases to be large than 1 at later times , since the electron distribution is changed in this case",
    ". therefore , the time - resolved spectrum at high - energies at later times can be harder than @xmath199 .",
    "however , the time - integrated spectrum of the high - energy emission will be still @xmath199 since the time - integrated fluence is dominated by the contribution at early times ( note that the flux decays usually faster than @xmath200 ) , at which times @xmath133 usually . the low - significance data of the time - resolved spectra of grb090510 and grb090902b",
    "prevent us from identifying the kn effect in the spectrum ( de pasquale et al .",
    "2009 ; abdo et al .",
    "obtaining high - significance time - resolved spectra at high - energies from bright grbs in future would be very useful do this .",
    "we have studied the kn effect on early high - energy afterglow emission of grbs .",
    "our findings are summarized as :    \\i ) the ic scatterings between high - energy electrons that produce early - time high - energy ( @xmath0 mev ) afterglow emission and synchrotron peak photons of the afterglow are generally in the deep kn scattering regime . as a result ,",
    "the ic loss of these electrons is small and the synchrotron luminosity at @xmath201 mev is high , which is favorable for the detection of high - energy gamma - ray emission from the early afterglow by fermi lat .",
    "ii)the high - energy gamma - ray emission at the early afterglow phase is dominated by the synchrotron emission .",
    "the ssc emission becomes dominated only at energies above the maximum synchrotron photon energy of shock - accelerated electrons , but at such energies the ssc flux is usually too weak to be detectable by fermi lat .",
    "iii)the kn suppression effect of high - energy electrons weakens with time , so that the ic loss increases with time . in the parameter space where the compton parameter is @xmath202",
    ", the increasing ic loss leads to a faster temporal decay of the synchrotron afterglow emission at high frequency .",
    "the decay slope could be steeper by a factor of @xmath203 at most under favorable conditions .",
    "this may explain the rapid decay of the early - time high - energy emission observed in grb090510 and grb090902b .",
