    "heisenberg spin ladders have been extensively studied via a number of powerful theoretical methods including direct diagonalization  @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",

    "such perturbative expansions are routinely assumed to be meaningful , even in the region where the inter - chain and intra - chain couplings are comparable ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath7 )  @xcite .    in the present work we present a perturbative treatment of two - leg spin ladders implemented using a `` plaquette '' basis which",
    ", as we have argued elsewhere  @xcite , is particularly well - suited to the study of such systems for a variety of reasons .",

    "so doing we avoid the more general , and , thus necessarily more complicated , diagrammatic methods of `` connected graph expansions ''  @xcite .",
    "specifically we can , with modest computational effort , determine the bulk values of the ground state energy per site , the spin gap , and the one magnon dispersion relation to eleventh , fourth and third order , respectively .",
    "moreover , by performing similar calculations in the rung basis , we can make reliable quantitative comparisons of the radii of convergence of the perturbative expansion in the two bases .",
    "indeed , we determine that the radius of convergence in the rung basis is @xmath8 while for the plaquette basis , where , as will be discussed below , @xmath2 scales the inter - plaquette coupling , we find @xmath3 to @xmath9 .",

    "the paper concludes with a summary section .",
    "for a two - leg ladder , the dynamics are described by the heisenberg hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the strength of the antiferromagnetic coupling along the rungs(chains ) of the ladder  @xcite . in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath13 )",
    "rungs interact very weakly with each other and the above separation of the hamiltonian is a natural one .",
    "indeed , by fixing the large scale in the problem to be one ( @xmath14 ) the hamiltonian can be separated into the sum of @xmath15 , which contains the intra - rung interactions , and a potential @xmath16scaled by the small parameter @xmath17 , responsible for inducing interactions between rungs . in this way , the dominant intra - rung hamiltonian can be written as ( see fig .  [ figzero ] ) @xmath18 while the inter - rung potential ( @xmath19 ) is expressible in terms of @xmath20 \\;.",
    "\\label{rungvee}\\ ] ] note that @xmath21 labels a specific rung and the sum runs over all @xmath22 rungs in the ladder .",
    "the rung basis is particularly suitable in the strong - coupling regime , as @xmath15 is diagonal in this basis .",
    "indeed , eigenstates(eigenenergies ) of @xmath15 are a direct product(sum ) of single - rung states(energies ) of the form : @xmath23 here the two spins along the rung are coupled to a total angular momentum @xmath24 , which can be zero or one , and projection @xmath25 .",
    "what remains to be done is to evaluate matrix elements of the potential in the rung basis .",
    "to do so , we rely on the same angular - momentum techniques  @xcite that were used to evaluate matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the plaquette basis@xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath26 note that we have defined @xmath27 and that the @xmath28 sign in the above expression should be adopted whenever @xmath29  is even / odd .",
    "moreover , the above expression vanishes whenever @xmath30 is odd . aside from simple phases and numerical factors ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath31 depend on scalar functions ( i.e. , independent of @xmath25 ) known as racah coefficients ; here we cast the matrix elements in terms of the more symmetric @xmath32 symbols  @xcite .",
    "for an isotropic ( @xmath33 ) two - leg ladder , an efficient decomposition can be carried out in terms of distinct pairs of adjacent rungs ; these are the plaquettes .",
    "in such a decomposition , a @xmath34 ladder , for example , would be viewed as a pair of interacting plaquettes .",

    "[ pertn ] can be used for each individual state in the degenerate band , as states with different linear momenta can not mix at any order in perturbation theory .",
    "we have systematically determined that , for sufficiently small values of @xmath2 , our perturbative calculations agree essentially perfectly at large order with exact results obtained by direct diagonalization or lanczos techniques .",
    "the essential concept that we use to extract perturbative quantities in the bulk limit from calculations for finite systems is that of `` connectedness '' .",
    "it is well known in many - body theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that any given perturbative contribution to the coefficients ( @xmath67 ) appearing in the expansion for the ground - state energy [ see eqs .",
    "( [ pertenergy],[pertn ] ) ] consists only of spatially connected terms .",
    "this is also the basis of the connected - graph expansions alluded to in the introduction . as is well - known  @xcite , both connected and disconnected terms appear in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory .",
    "however , the disconnected terms are canceled by contributions included in the subtractions appearing in the evaluation of the @xmath68 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ pertn ] ) .",
    "the linked - cluster expansions were , of course , developed to avoid dealing with disconnected terms which would eventually be canceled anyway , the price being much greater conceptual complexity .    in this work ,",
    "we employ rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory and find that the computational penalty for not excluding disconnected contributions from the outset is insignificant compared to the advantages arising form the simplicity of the formulation .",
    "still , we must exploit the connectedness of the surviving contributions to extract bulk properties . in the present context",
    ", connected terms are those for which a single , finite cluster of adjacent plaquettes can be identified such that : 1 ) all interactions involve plaquettes within that cluster and 2 ) all plaquettes in the cluster are involved in one or more interactions ( note that in the present discussion we make explicit reference to plaquettes ; however , all the arguments remain valid in the rung basis , unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "it is apparent that , at order @xmath69 in perturbation theory , the _",
    "largest _ such cluster contains @xmath70 plaquettes .",
    "hence , we may conclude that , at @xmath69th order , no new kinds of clusters appear as we change the number of plaquettes , @xmath59 , provided @xmath71 . instead , only the number of times that each type of cluster appears changes with @xmath59 .",
    "as the energy must scale at most with @xmath59 , we may conclude that the ground - state energy is generally expressible as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are `` intensive '' coefficients , which are independent of @xmath59 , for @xmath71 . this simple , physically reasonable behavior  and more specifically the absence of terms depending on @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ,",
    "is again related to connectedness  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was in order to eliminate terms with `` anomalous '' @xmath59-dependence that the linked - cluster expansion was first proposed .",
    "it is clear that , for the case of periodic boundary conditions , we may set @xmath78 .",
    "thus , to @xmath69th order in perturbation theory , the ground - state energy - per - site of an @xmath59-plaquette ladder becomes independent of the number of plaquettes for @xmath79 .",
    "obviously then , the @xmath69th order energy - per - site _ in the bulk limit _ can be expressed as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the singlet ground state for an @xmath59-plaquette ladder , assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the structure of the unperturbed one - magnon states @xmath82 or , equivalently , the fact that the gap is an intensive quantity , ensures that , in the bulk limit , the energy - per - site equals that of the ground state . hence",
    ", we may conclude that all one - magnon states have the same _ extensive _ contribution as the ground state .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 again , to @xmath69th order , @xmath84 can be determined from studying a finite ladder with at least @xmath85 plaquettes . for @xmath86",
    ", @xmath87 is just the spin gap at order @xmath69 and its value _ in the bulk limit _ is found simply by taking the difference between the @xmath69th order energies for the lowest one - magnon state and the ground state where both are evaluated for an @xmath88-plaquette system with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath89 we use this formula to determine the perturbative contributions to the spin gap in the bulk limit presented in the following sections .",
    "note that in the rung basis , it is the linear momentum corresponding to @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) which generates the lowest one - magnon state . in this case",
    "one must employ a finite ladder containing an even number of rungs .",
    "it is also easy to show that the @xmath69th order one - magnon dispersion relation has the following form : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the linear momentum in lattice units .",
    "note that that in the plaquette basis the gap is given by @xmath94 while , in the rung basis , @xmath95 .",
    "it might be anticipated that , at order @xmath69 , the @xmath70 coefficients which specify the full dispersion relation at this order could be extracted directly from the values of the differences @xmath96 however , a moment s thought reveals that some of these one - magnon states are degenerate and , thus , energies for systems larger than @xmath97 are typically required . indeed , for a @xmath98 ( eight - rung )",
    "system , a perturbative calculation in the rung basis determines the bulk values of the energy - per - site and the gap up to 7th - order in perturbation theory , but only to 4th - order for the dispersion relation .",
    "nevertheless , it is always possible to ascertain the _ width _ of the one - magnon band at @xmath69-th order from calculations for systems with @xmath85 plaquettes , provided @xmath59 is even .    finally , it should be noted that the structure of the ground state in the plaquette basis ( and , indeed , in any basis in which the unperturbed ground state is made out of singlets ) affords a less obvious but more efficient means of extracting the coefficients that determine the ground - state energy in the bulk limit .",
    "to see this , we first note that @xmath99 contains only @xmath100 plaquettes [ see eq .",
    "( [ jzerozero ] ) ] . since the inter - plaquette interaction @xmath16 , specified in eq .",
    "( [ plaquettevee ] ) , consists of rank-1 operators in the space of a single plaquette , any plaquette appearing in a connected cluster must experience at least _ two _ interactions in order that it be returned to its original @xmath100 state .",
    "for this reason , it can be shown that @xmath81 , when computed with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions , may be expressed as : @xmath101 }                     ( n - m)\\,w_m^{(n)}(n\\!=\\!m\\!+\\!1 ) \\ ; ,    \\label{egsopen}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 $ ] is the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath103 .",
    "then , for example , the quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be extracted from fifth - order calculations for systems with only two and three plaquettes .",
    "( note that , in contrast , the extraction of fifth - order coefficients ( @xmath67 ) for the ground - state energy using periodic - boundary conditions and eq .",
    "( [ egsn ] ) requires calculations for systems with six plaquettes . )",
    "then , the @xmath69th - order energy - per - site in the bulk limit is easily found to be @xmath106 } w_m^{(n)}(n\\!=\\!m\\!+\\!1 ) \\;.",
    "\\label{epsbulk}\\ ] ] we use this formula to determine the bulk perturbative ground state energy contributions presented in the following sections .",
    "we first demonstrate our method for extracting perturbative energies in the bulk limit from rayleigh - schrdinger calculations for finite systems .",
    "[ figonerung ] shows rung - basis calculations for the ground state energy and for the spin gap for systems with 4 , 6 , and 8 rungs .",
    "these calculations were done for @xmath107 so convergence to dmrg values@xcite is very fast .",
    "[ figonerung ] shows that , at orders @xmath108 and @xmath109 , all calculations give the same per - rung energy and spin - gap contributions , as we would expect from the arguments of the preceding section . at @xmath110 ,",

    "finally , the 6- and 8-rung values begin to differ for @xmath111 .",
    "note that our 7th - order perturbative result for the spin gap agrees with the dmrg value to about 0.07% ( for the energy per site both results are indistinguishable to five significant figures ) . the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ figonerung ] also demonstrates that , when eq .",
    "( [ epsbulk ] ) is used , the contributions to the ground - state energy extracted from 4-rung calculations with open boundary conditions agree with those obtained from an 8-rung ladder with periodic boundary conditions through @xmath112 , as expected .",
    "this result embodies the power of the method , and the high degree of symmetry of the unperturbed ground state and the residual interaction .",
    "indeed , an 8-rung calculation affords the computation of the ground - state energy  up to 15th order in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , from one such calculation , namely , a @xmath113 ladder at a single value of @xmath2 , one can extract the perturbative coefficients for the ground - state energy and the spin gap up to 7th - order .",
    "that is , the ground - state energy per site is given by @xmath114 while for the spin gap we obtain : @xmath115    of course , these two expressions can be used for arbitrary values of @xmath2 , provided these values lie within the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansions ( more on this point later ) . in fig .",
    "[ figtworung ] we have displayed the bulk values for the ground - state energy per site and the spin gap to various orders in perturbation theory ; we have also included exact results obtained on a @xmath113 ladder .",

    "this should not come as a surprise , as the rung basis has been customized to handle the strong - coupling region .",
    "in contrast , the convergence of the perturbative results in the intermediate- to isotropic - coupling region @xmath117 is harder to assess .",
    "however , the fact that there is no systematic improvement  nor convergence  in the results as one goes to higher orders in perturbation theory , strongly suggests that the expansion might no longer be convergent .    in an effort to establish quantitatively the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion , we have compared high - order perturbative and exact results for finite ladders over a range of @xmath2 values . for example , fig .",
    "[ figthreerung ] shows the ground - state energy per site through 50th order in perturbation theory for 4- , 6- and 8-rung ladders as a function of @xmath2 .",

    "these perturbative results are indistinguishable from the lanczos energies for @xmath118 . as the value of @xmath119 appears to have very little dependence on the size of the ladder , we assume it is also appropriate to the bulk system .",
    "thus , we conclude that the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion in the rung basis is @xmath120 .",
    "this result indicates that perturbative expansions in the rung basis are unsuitable for dealing with the physically - interesting case of isotropic @xmath4 ladders .",

    "<S> we compute bulk properties of heisenberg spin-1/2 ladders using rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in the rung and plaquette bases . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a method to extract high - order perturbative coefficients in the bulk limit from solutions for relatively small finite clusters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a perturbative calculation for an isotropic @xmath0 ladder yields an eleventh - order estimate of the ground - state energy per site that is within 0.02% of the density - matrix - renormalization - group ( dmrg ) value . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the method also enables a reliable estimate of the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the rung basis the radius of convergence is @xmath1 , with @xmath2 defining the ratio between the coupling along the chain relative to the coupling across the chain . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the plaquette basis we estimate a radius of convergence of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the plaquette basis offers the only currently available perturbative approach which can provide a reliable treatment of the physically interesting case of isotropic @xmath4 spin ladders . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our methods by computing perturbative coefficients for the ground - state energy per site , the gap , and the one - magnon dispersion relation . </S>"
