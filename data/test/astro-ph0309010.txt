    "cosmic rays above energies of @xmath5  ev are investigated by measurements of extensive air showers in the atmosphere .",
    "these cascades of secondary particles are generated by interactions of high - energy particles with air nuclei .",
    "while the shower develops in the atmosphere the number of particles increases up to a depth where the average energy of the secondaries equals a critical energy . beyond this point",
    "the number of particles decreases approximately exponentially .",
    "the depth where the cascade reaches the largest number of charged particles is usually referred to as the depth of the shower maximum .",
    "two basic methods are used to examine air showers . in the first , the debris of the particle cascade on the earth s surface is observed in large detector arrays , measuring electrons , muons , and hadrons , viz .",
    "particle distributions at ground level .",
    "the second , calorimetric method investigates the longitudinal development of the shower by registration of erenkov or fluorescence light , generated by the shower particles in the atmosphere , and eventually  is derived .",
    "recently , the author has compiled the results of many air shower experiments with the intention to estimate the best primary all - particle spectrum ( hrandel 2003 ) .",
    "for this purpose , the energy spectra of individual elements as directly measured at the top of the atmosphere below 1  pev have been extrapolated to high energy using power laws and assuming individual rigidity dependent cut - offs .",
    "the all - particle spectrum of these direct measurements was compared with air shower observations at higher energies . for the indirect measurements it turned out",
    "that the individual energy scales had to be renormalized to match the all - particle spectrum of direct measurements at 1  pev .",
    "only small energy shifts were necessary , all within the errors quoted by the experiments .",
    "but most shifts had a negative sign , indicating an overestimation of the primary energy .",
    "a likely explanation for this effect will be discussed later in chapter  [ nenmusect ] .    as a result",
    "all experiments yielded consistent all - particle energy spectra .",
    "the extrapolations of the direct measurements have been fitted to the average all - particle flux of the indirect measurements to determine the parameters of the individual cut - offs mentioned above .",
    "it has been shown , that the experimental data can be parametrized consistently within a phenomenological model , the .",
    "the mean logarithmic mass @xmath4 obtained from the model is compatible with results from experiments measuring particle distributions at ground level .",
    "but the mass composition disagrees with results from experiments investigating the longitudinal shower development in the atmosphere .    a possible cause for the discrepancy might be , that the measured cascades penetrate deeper into the atmosphere than predicted by the simulations , viz .",
    "the codes predict a too small value of .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by erlykin and wolfendale ( 2002 ) .",
    "investigating the muon production height with the kascade experiment , bttner ( 2001 ) also find an indication for a deeper penetration of cascades into the atmosphere as compared with predictions of the air shower simulation program corsika ( heck 1998 ) with the high - energy interaction model qgsjet ( kalmykov 1997 ) .",
    "reasons why the codes predict too small -values may be numerous .",
    "objective of the present article is to study the influence of model parameters like the inelastic cross - sections or the elasticity on the average value of  and , consequently , on the mean logarithmic mass derived from it .",
    "goal of the investigations is to perhaps resolve the discrepancies in @xmath4 outlined above .",
    "some aspects of the impact of the complex system of parameters in simulation codes on  are briefly summarized in chapter  [ litsect ] .",
    "variations of the interaction model qgsjet are described in chapter  [ crosssect ] .",
    "the resulting changes of  and the consequences on @xmath4 are presented in chapters  [ xmaxsect ] and [ lnasect ] . for completeness",
    ", the influence of the changes on the number of electrons and muons at ground level is briefly sketched in chapter  [ nenmusect ] .",
    "the longitudinal development of the nuclear cascade depends among others essentially on following physics quantities : the inelastic cross - sections @xmath6 of primary and secondary particles with air nuclei , the average number of particles produced in an interaction  the multiplicity @xmath7 , and the average fraction of energy transferred into secondary particles  the inelasticity @xmath8 .",
    "an increase of the inelastic cross - sections results in an earlier development of the cascade . a similar effect has an increased inelasticity .",
    "the particles lose more energy , hence the shower reaches its maximum earlier in the atmosphere .",
    "a reduction of the multiplicity produces less particles in the first interactions . due to energy conservation",
    "they will be more energetic and the shower develops more slowly , i.e. the maximum is deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "pajares ( 2000 ) derived a parametrization for the relative change of  as function of the changes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 a similar relation for the dependence of  on inelastic cross - sections will be given below in chapter  [ xmaxsect ] .",
    "a variety of models has been used to study the development of extensive air showers and the effects of different parameters in the simulations on have been elaborated in the literature .",
    "some of the findings are summarized in the following .",
    "the average depths of the shower maximum obtained for different interaction models implemented in corsika  i.e. dpmjet  2.5 ( ranft 1995 and 1999 ) , nexus  2 ( drescher 2001 ) , qgsjet  01 , and sibyll  2.1 ( fletcher 1994 , engel 1999 )  have been compared by knapp ( 2003 ) . at energies a spread of the models of about 50",
    "2  has been found for proton induced showers and 20  2  for primary iron nuclei .",
    "similar results have been obtained by fowler ( 2001 ) .",
    "the systematic differences in  between different models in corsika  hdpm ( capdevielle 1992 ) , qgsjet , sibyll , venus ( werner 1993 )  at 1  pev are specified as 45  2  for primary protons and 25  2  for iron nuclei .",
    "the longitudinal shower development for the hadronic interaction models sibyll and qgsjet embedded in the framework of the mocca ( hillas 1997 ) and corsika programs has been explored by pryke ( 2001 ) . at 1  pev",
    "the differences in between corsika / qgsjet and mocca with its internal hadronic interaction model amount to 45  2  for primary protons and to 30  2  for iron induced showers .",
    "the differences between the interaction models are related to distinct inelasticities : qgsjet produces more inelastic events , which lead to less deeply penetrating showers . using the mocca frame in connection with its internal and the sibyll interaction model ,",
    "the values differ only by about 5 to 10  2 .",
    "this is compatible with estimates of dickinson ( 1999 ) who obtained an increase of about 10  2  from mocca / mocca to mocca / sibyll .",
    "wibig ( 2001 ) discussed the influence of various hadronic interaction models  fritiof ( anderson 1991 ) , gmc ( wibig 1997 ) , hdpm , qgsjet , sibyll , and venus  on the predictions for  using the shower simulation program corsika .",
    "for a primary energy of 1  pev he found differences in the order of 40  2  for primary protons and 18  2  for iron nuclei .",
    "a fast one - dimensional hybrid method has been used to simulate air showers by alvarez - muiz ( 2002a ) .",
    "the models qgsjet  98 and two versions of sibyll ( 1.7 and 2.1 ) have been applied to describe the hadronic interactions . for sibyll  2.1",
    "the inelastic proton - air cross - section rises faster with energy as compared with qgsjet , whereas the inelasticities are almost equal in both models . on the other hand",
    ", the multiplicity of charged secondary particles produced in proton - air collisions grows rapidly with energy for qgsjet .",
    "compared with qgsjet , for sibyll  2.1 the mean values of  of proton induced showers are about 6  2  larger at energies of 1  pev and 10  2  at 1  eev .    gaisser ( 1993 ) investigated the statistical model ( landau 1969 , fowler 1987 ) , the kopeliovich - nikolaev - potashnikova ( knp ) model ( kopeliovich 1989 ) , and the mini - jet model ( gaisser and halzen 1987 ) .",
    "the characteristic differences between them are the energy dependences of the inelasticity . in the statistical model",
    "the inelasticity decreases with energy , almost constant values are obtained for the mini - jet model , and in the knp model the inelasticity grows with energy . at 1.25",
    "eev the depth of the maximum of proton initiated showers varies by about 45  2 . due to the larger inelasticity the showers develop faster in the knp model as compared with the statistical model .",
    "the latter represents the other extreme , generating relatively long showers .",
    "the impact of internal parameters in the quark gluon string model ( qgsjet ) on the average depth of the shower maximum was examined by kalmykov ( 1995 ) .",
    "different implementations for the contributions of semihard processes lead to differences in  for primary protons of about 18  2  and 40  2  at 1  pev and 100  pev , respectively .",
    "the role of the production of charm particles for the air shower development was found to be negligible , the estimated differences are in the order of 3  2 .",
    "the effect of the multiplicity of secondary particles on  was scrutinized by anchordoqui ( 1999 ) using the aires program ( sciutto 1998 ) with the models sibyll and qgsjet . for both models the aires cross -",
    "sections have been utilized in the calculations . as a consequence of the lower inelasticity in sibyll , the model produces fewer secondaries than qgsjet .",
    "hence , there is a delay in the shower development for sibyll generated cascades .",
    "primary protons with energies of 1  pev penetrate deeper into the atmosphere by about 45  2and 100  2  at 1  eev .",
    "capdevielle and attallah ( 1995 ) pointed out how uncertainties in the description of parton distribution functions of hadrons influence the longitudinal development of air showers .",
    "the effects on inelastic cross - sections , multiplicity and inelasticity were derived .",
    "the maximal uncertainty in  was estimated to be at 1  eev in the order of 95  2for proton induced showers and 40  2  for iron primaries .    a second step cascading mechanism was discussed in the geometrical multichain model by wibig ( 1999 ) .",
    "second step cascading is defined as the interaction of a wounded nucleon of one nucleus with another nucleon from the same nucleus before hadronization occurs .",
    "these internuclear cascades result in an increase of the hadron air inelasticity for heavy nuclei .",
    "results of corsika simulations with this interaction model indicate that this mechanism results in an earlier shower development for iron nuclei of 10  2  to 30  2  at energies of 10  pev to 10  eev .",
    "new effects in high - energy interactions like percolation , quark gluon plasma , or string fusion were anticipated by pajares ( 2000 ) .",
    "the authors concluded that these effects dump the multiplicity and increase the inelasticity .",
    "this leads to larger values of .",
    "erlykin and wolfendale ( 2002 ) linked the observed discrepancies in @xmath4 to two effects in nucleus - nucleus collisions not been taken into account before : a few percent energy transfer into the electromagnetic component due to electron - positron pair production or electromagnetic radiation of quark gluon plasma and a small slow - down of the cascading process in its initial stages associated with the extended lifetime of excited nuclear fragments .",
    "the latter displaces the shower deeper into the atmosphere .    to summarize ,",
    "several hypothetical effects have been described which could change the longitudinal shower development and their influence is not easy to segregate from each other .",
    "the maximum model ambiguities , taking into account all considerations as discussed , amount in the  region to about @xmath10  2  for primary protons and 25  2  for iron induced showers .",
    "these uncertainties increase with energy to @xmath11  2  for proton induced showers at 1  eev . in principle , the quoted ambiguities could be reduced ( by some 30% ) as some model approaches can be rejected by theoretical arguments and/or comparison with accelerator or cosmic - ray data .",
    "in addition to the model ambiguities discussed so far , there are experimental uncertainties , which will be discussed in chapter  [ xmaxsect ] .",
    "among the various parameters which control the shower development , the inelastic cross - sections and the elasticity will be scrutinized more closely .",
    "the actual situation can be recapitulated as follows .",
    "inelastic cross - sections for proton - proton interactions are of great interest for particle physics .",
    "they have been measured in detail in collider experiments , but studied also at highest energies using cosmic rays . at energies exceeding @xmath12  tev the knowledge about the increase of the proton - proton cross - section as function of energy",
    "is limited by experimental errors of both , collider and cosmic - ray experiments .",
    "the insufficient knowledge of the high - energy cross - sections restricts the reliability of simulation programs to calculate the interactions of high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "a recent review of @xmath13 cross - sections from collider experiments has been given by hagiwara ( 2002 ) .",
    "at present , the highest energies at colliders are available at the tevatron ( @xmath14  tev ) . there",
    ", values for the total @xmath13 cross - section disagree by about 10% between different experiments , i.e. @xmath15  mb ( e-811 , avila 1999 ) , @xmath16  mb ( e-710 , amos 1992 ) , and @xmath17  mb ( cdf , abe 1994a ) .    in cosmic - ray experiments the attenuation of the proton flux entering the atmosphere is used to derive the inelastic proton - air cross - section .",
    "then , the latter is utilized to derive the proton - proton cross - section using the glauber theory ( glauber and matthiae 1970 ) . in air shower experiments",
    "three basic methods are applied to obtain cross - sections : + 1 ) the ratio of the proton flux at the top of the atmosphere @xmath18 to the flux of surviving protons @xmath19 measured below the atmosphere at a depth @xmath20 . from these quantities",
    "the interaction lengths of protons in air @xmath21 is determined using the relation @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "this method needs high fluxes of penetrating primary protons and , therefore , can be applied at relatively low energies only , see yodh ( 1983 ) .",
    "+ the second and third method take advantage of the fact that cosmic - ray protons interact in the atmosphere at rates which decrease exponentially with increasing depth .",
    "+ 2 ) for a fixed primary energy and zenith angle the distribution of the average depth of the shower maximum has an exponential tail with a slope given by the attenuation length @xmath23 , see e.g. ( baltrusaitis 1984 ) or ( gaisser 1993 ) .",
    "+ 3 ) the last method to derive @xmath23 utilizes the zenith angle distributions of the shower intensity for fixed primary energies , as described by hara ( 1983 ) .",
    "the attenuation length is connected with the interaction length @xmath24 by the relation @xmath25 @xmath26 is a model dependent proportional factor , which among others depends on the mean inelasticity of the interactions @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the total inelastic proton - air cross - section , @xmath29 the effective atomic weight of air with the proton mass @xmath30 .",
    "the conversion of the attenuation lengths to cross - sections depends essentially on theoretical assumptions on @xmath26 , for a discussion and theoretical motivation see e.g. ( kopeliovich 1989 ) , ( engel 1998 ) , or ( block 2000 ) .",
    "for example , using a different value for @xmath31 in equation , total inelastic cross - sections obtained by baltrusaitis ( 1984 ) and honda ( 1993 ) around c.m .",
    "energies @xmath32  tev have been reduced by 10% to 15% by block .",
    "the original value of the fly s eye experiment @xmath33  mb at @xmath34  tev has been rescaled to @xmath35  mb .    the subsequent conversion of proton - air to proton - proton cross - sections depends on theoretical uncertainties as well .",
    "the details required to apply glauber theory in this context have been discussed by gaisser ( 1987 ) as well as by wibig and sobczyska ( 1998 ) .",
    "the latter apply a geometrical scaling hypothesis , use an exact glauber formalism and conclude , that the proton - proton cross - sections reported by baltrusaitis and honda are overestimated by about 10% .",
    "besides the theoretical uncertainties , all methods require that the primary cosmic - ray flux contains a sufficient fraction of protons , e.g. hara ( 1983 ) derive cross - sections under the assumption of a contribution of at least 10% protons .",
    "thus , additional systematic errors have to be taken into account concerning the unknown mass composition at high energies .    in early cosmic - ray work",
    "an increase of the inelastic cross - section as function of energy has been found by yodh ( 1972 , 1973 ) . in the energy range up to 100  tev",
    "the measured flux of unaccompanied hadrons at ground level has been used to calculate lower bounds for the proton - air cross - sections by yodh ( 1983 ) combining several experimental results and also by mielke ( 1994 ) using the kascade prototype calorimeter .",
    "particle numbers measured with the eas - top experiment have been used to deduce a value for the inelastic proton - air cross - section at  energies ( aglietta 1997 ) . at the highest energies",
    "@xmath36 has been derived from the shower attenuation length @xmath23 by the fly s eye experiment ( baltrusaitis 1984 ) using the exponential tail of  distributions and by the agasa experiment ( honda 1993 ) measuring particle numbers at ground level .",
    "dyakonov ( 1990 ) derived lower limits for cross - sections from investigations of the yakutsk data , applying two methods , fits to the exponential tail of  and observing the zenith angle distribution of the shower intensity for fixed energies . a second analysis of the yakutsk data ( knurenko 1999 ) takes into account the tail of the  distributions at fixed energies .",
    "the results obtained are shown in as function of laboratory energy @xmath37 .",
    "the experimental values shown in have been derived assuming a sufficiently large contribution of protons in primary cosmic rays .",
    "the validity of this assumption shall be examined next . for this reason",
    ", the fraction of protons as function of energy is shown in .",
    "it has been obtained from the analysis of direct measurements and air shower data applying the , as outlined in the introduction .",
    "the solid line represents the ratio @xmath38 for the cosmic rays which shall be denoted , with precaution , as the `` galactic component '' .",
    "the error band indicates the uncertainties expected from the model .",
    "since the average all - particle spectrum is reasonably well known , the error indicated depends essentially on the parametrization of the proton flux and its errors . according to the the galactic component is characterized by cut - offs of the flux of individual elements at energies proportional to their nuclear charge ( @xmath39 ) , starting with protons at an energy @xmath40  pev . above @xmath41  gev",
    "this galactic component is not sufficient to describe the observed all - particle spectrum within the model .",
    "hence , an additional component has to be introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ in order to account for the measured flux values . above @xmath42  gev",
    "the dashed line gives an upper limit for the proton fraction , assuming the component being protons only .",
    "the proton fraction decreases with energy from 35% at @xmath43  gev to below 1% at @xmath44  gev . beyond this energy",
    "the upper limit increases again .",
    "however , taking the error band into account , at least between @xmath45 and @xmath41  gev protons contribute only little to the all - particle flux ( @xmath46 ) . thus ,",
    "one of the premises to derive proton - air cross - sections in this energy region is weakened and , maybe , the values obtained from air shower measurements have to be corrected .    in order to check the impact of inelastic cross - sections on the development of extensive air showers ,",
    "the cross - sections are altered within a particular model .",
    "the present studies have been carried out using the simulation program corsika version 6.0190 .",
    "investigations by the kascade group ( antoni 1999 , milke 2001 ) indicate that the interaction model qgsjet  98 describes the measured data most consistently .",
    "hence , the latest version of this code , i.e. qgsjet  01 , has been chosen for the simulations . within this program",
    "the parametrizations for the inelastic hadronic cross - sections have been modified in order to change their energy dependence at high energies , the contribution of mini - jets has been reduced .",
    "the changes affect all inelastic cross - sections , like proton - proton , proton - air , and pion - air at the same time .",
    "in addition , a parameter had to be readjusted which essentially influences the multiplicity of produced particles in order to match pseudo - rapidity distributions of collider experiments .",
    "this implies a reduction of the average number of charged particles produced .    in the following the original qgsjet code",
    "is referred to as model  1 , while the two modifications with smaller cross - sections are labeled model  2 and 3 , respectively . in addition , for model  3 the average transverse momentum has been reduced and the elasticity has been increased , these changes are combined in model  3a .",
    "the inelastic cross - sections for models  1 to 3 for proton - proton collisions are shown in as function of laboratory energy .",
    "at @xmath41  gev the cross - sections vary between @xmath47  mb for the original qgsjet model and @xmath2  mb for model  3 . at the tevatron ( @xmath48  gev ) for the total elastic @xmath13 cross - section the values @xmath49  mb ( e-811 , avila 1999 ) , @xmath50  mb ( e-710 , amos 1990 ) , and @xmath51  mb ( cdf , abe 1994b ) have been measured .",
    "together with the total cross - sections mentioned above , values for the total inelastic cross - section are obtained as shown in the figure .",

    ", intrinsic shower fluctuations strongly influence the cross - sections obtained from such measurements .",
    "the experimental uncertainties may be illustrated by two analyses of the yakutsk data .",
    "the cross - sections obtained by dyakonov ( 1990 ) are found to be compatible with model  3 , while on the other hand , the more recent values of knurenko ( 1999 ) are about @xmath57 above model  3 . summarizing , no serious disagreement between experimental values and the cross - sections for model  3 can be stated .    in the cross - sections for models  1 to 3",

    "one has to bear in mind this indication when proton - air cross - sections are derived from air shower measurements .",

    "a key issue of the present investigations is that cosmic rays above @xmath41  gev , i.e. the component , contain a significant contribution of particles heavier than protons .",

    "the cross - sections vary within the error range given by the experiments and at @xmath41  gev the proton - air cross - sections of models 1 and 3 differ only by about 10% , but the general trend of the emerging @xmath4 distributions proves to be significantly different .    at this point",
    "the circle closes .",
    "if we assume in the energy region from @xmath45 to @xmath41  gev a small proton fraction only , the cross - sections have to be corrected and lowered to the region of values for model  3 . in turn a heavier composition is obtained for model  3 as has been demonstrated in .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively the arguments are consistent .",
    "results from the balloon experiments jacee ( shibata 1999 ) and runjob ( apanasenko 2001 ) are presented in figures  [ masse1 ] to [ massecors ] ( filled points ) for comparison .",
    "no hint for a decreasing mean logarithmic mass is indicated by these measurements .",
    "the solid lines shown in the figures are predictions according to the  for the galactic component and the dashed lines include an component of protons only . both , the results of the balloon experiments shown as well as the values calculated with the  seem to support model  3a .",
    "in addition to the modifications of qgsjet , it would be interesting to look at the mean mass which is deduced from the measurements applying other models .",
    "values for the models dpmjet , nexus , and sibyll have been presented in . taking these predictions",
    "the experimental results lead to mean logarithmic masses shown in . at 4",
    "pev the average mass values range from @xmath82 for sibyll and nexus to @xmath83 for dpmjet . for nexus the authors of the model guarantee validity up to @xmath41  gev ,",
    "as mentioned above , for this reason @xmath4 is shown up to this energy only . as can be inferred from ,",
    "very similar depths are obtained for the models nexus and sibyll , both are hardly discernable from model  2 . as a consequence , the mean logarithmic masses derived are very much alike . on the other hand , the depths predicted by dpmjet are very similar to the results of model  3a and for both models a heavier mass composition is obtained . for the program mocca with its internal interaction model",
    "the showers penetrate extremely deep into the atmosphere and a relative heavy mass composition is obtained , not compatible with direct measurements ( hrandel 2003 ) .    at  energies the average experimental @xmath4 values vary from 1.2 when the data are interpreted with the original qgsjet ( model  1 ) to 2.0 for a dpmjet interpretation .",
    "one has to admit that the model ambiguities result in an uncertainty @xmath84 . at this energy",
    "the scatter in the measured average depth of the shower maximum , as presented in , yields a rms value of the individual experimental results in the order of @xmath85 .",
    "this value is compatible with @xmath85 obtained for experiments measuring particle distributions at ground level , as discussed elsewhere ( hrandel 2003 ) .",
    "also other authors have studied the effects of different interaction models on @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic influence of the models hdpm , qgsjet , sibyll , and venus on the results of the blanca experiment is discussed by fowler ( 2001 ) . at  energies a",
    "maximum offset @xmath86 between qgsjet and sibyll as well as hdpm is obtained .",
    "the investigations of wibig ( 2001 ) yield a maximum difference @xmath87 between venus and sibyll . comparing results from qgsjet  98 and sibyll  1.6 an uncertainty of @xmath88",
    "is found by swordy ( 2002 ) at  energies .",
    "investigations of several hadronic observables by the kascade group yield model ambiguities of @xmath89 around the  ( hrandel 1998 ) .",
    "these estimates from the literature seem to be well compatible with the ambiguities determined above .    as already mentioned in the introduction , the mean logarithmic mass as obtained with experiments investigating particle distributions at ground level is compatible with the results of the . but",
    "these results disagree with @xmath4 values obtained from measurements of the longitudinal shower development interpreted with qgsjet  01 .",
    "this incompatibility can be seen in , as well as for the models nexus  2 and sibyll  2.1 presented in . for several experiments the mean logarithmic mass decreases as function of energy up to  energies , a tendency not supported by the extrapolation of the direct measurements .",
    "this effect is strongest for qgsjet  01 .",
    "using lower cross - sections and larger values for the elasticity in the model qgsjet the @xmath4 values obtained are comparable with the results of experiments investigating particle distributions . in other words , the disagreement between the two groups of experiments can be reduced , if model  3a is taken . with the altered inelastic cross - sections and",
    "the larger elasticity consistency can be achieved between the predictions of the  and the mass composition derived from observed  values .",
    "similar values of @xmath4 as for model  3a are also obtained using dpmjet  2.5 to interpret the data .",
    "the main conclusion of the present investigation is that relatively deep penetrating showers with  values similar to the ones obtained with model  3a or dpmjet  2.5 seem to yield most consistent @xmath4 values . on the other hand , investigations of secondary particles produced in air showers by milke ( 2001 ) , based on corsika simulations with the low energy model gheisha ,",
    "reveal that for a given number of muons dpmjet  2.5 transports more hadronic energy to the observation level as compared with the measurements of the kascade experiment .",
    "hence , presently model  3a is the preferred model to describe air shower measurements most consistently .",
    "the modified cross - sections and elasticity values influence not only the average depth of the shower maximum but also other air shower observables .",
    "the implications on shower sizes at ground level might be strong and , therefore , are investigated in the following .",
    "many air shower arrays use the correlation between the number of electrons @xmath90 and the number of muons @xmath91 to determine the cosmic - ray mass composition . for showers with primary energies between @xmath55 and @xmath92  gev the average number of muons with energies above 100  mev",
    "is plotted versus the average number of electrons with energies above 0.25  mev in ( left - hand side ) .",
    "correlations from corsika / qgsjet simulations for proton and iron induced showers are shown , using the original qgsjet  01 and model  3a .",
    "the first impression is , no significant differences between the two models can be found and , consequently , no significant changes in the mass composition derived are expected .",
    "a closer look , when investigating the relative changes for the numbers obtained reveals small deviations .",
    "the number of electrons and muons obtained with model  3a normalized to the results of the original qgsjet model are shown on the right - hand side of the figure . at energies of the  ( 4  pev )",
    "the number of electrons increases by about 5% when using model  3a for both primaries , protons and iron nuclei .",
    "the increase in the number of muons amounts to about 15% .",
    "this outcome may qualitatively explain the need to accommodate the energy scales of many air shower experiments with respect to direct measurements as outlined in the introduction .",
    "it has been found that at energies air shower experiments overestimate the energy on average by about 3% .",
    "this can be understood , if the interaction models predict too small electron and muon numbers , since these quantities are mostly used by experiments to estimate the primary energy .",
    "in fact , the change in electron and muon numbers from models  1 to 3a corresponds to an energy uncertainty of about 5% and 15% , respectively .",
    "these numbers depend on the threshold for electrons as well as muons and differ from experiment to experiment . a quantitative investigation for each experiment would require detailed detector simulations .",
    "however , the numbers indicate that the observed energy overestimation of air shower experiments relative to direct measurements may be explained by too high inelastic cross - sections and too low values for the elasticity .    at higher energies around @xmath41",
    "gev the number of both , electrons and muons , generated by model 3a is increased by about 15% to 20% as compared with the original qgsjet ( model  1 ) .",
    "the changes in @xmath90 and @xmath91 correspond to energy shifts in the order of 10% to 20% . in this energy region",
    "the air shower experiments overestimate the primary energy on average by about 10% according to the above mentioned investigations .",
    "this value is comparable with the systematic offset between models  1 and 3a .",
    "again , the exact numbers depend on individual detection thresholds for each experiment .",
    "these findings are an independent hint for a slower logarithmic rise of the inelastic cross - sections as well as slightly increased elasticities and , consequently , deeper penetrating cascades as presumed so far .",
    "it may be summarized that differences between the models shift the data points parallel to the lines on the left - hand side of ( i.e. in `` energy direction '' ) and not perpendicular ( i.e. in `` mass direction '' ) , hence only a change in energy and no significant change in the mass composition derived from the data are expected .",
    "more detailed investigations are necessary to study the implications of the modifications on observables , performing detector simulations for individual experiments , but this is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "in addition , to interpret experimental data not only high - energy interaction models as discussed presently are important , but also models to describe interactions below 100  gev , as for example gheisha , fluka , or urqmd , all available in corsika . for a final conclusion , the complex interplay between low and high - energy models as well as their influence on observables measured in ground arrays has to be studied .",
    "the impact of reduced inelastic cross - sections and increased values for the elasticity on the development of extensive air showers has been studied with the simulation program corsika . within the high - energy hadronic interaction model qgsjet the logarithmic increase of the inelastic cross - sections as function of energy has been lowered and the elasticity has been increased .",
    "the average depth of the shower maximum was calculated for primary protons and iron nuclei and compared with experimental values .",
    "the mean logarithmic mass @xmath4 was derived from the experimental data for three assumptions for the increase of the inelastic cross - sections and two hypotheses for the elasticity .",
    "the disagreement in the observed @xmath4 values between experiments measuring particle distributions at ground level and experiments measuring the average depth of the shower maximum could be reduced .",
    "the data exhibit still a scattering in the order of @xmath80 but the general trend of the increase as function of energy is now similar for both classes .",
    "a reduced and only modest increase of the cross - sections as function of energy had to be applied .",
    "best agreement is obtained for model  3a with an increase of the total inelastic proton - proton cross - section to 72  mb at @xmath61  gev and an additional increase of the elasticity of about 10% to 15% . in turn , the increase of @xmath4 with energy according to the  becomes compatible with the two classes of experiments . as a result ,",
    "model  3a allows a consistent description of the extrapolations of individual element spectra as obtained by direct measurements and the all - particle energy spectrum as well as the cosmic - ray mass composition obtained by most air shower experiments .",
    "the author would like to thank s.  ostapchenko for giving insight into details of the model qgsjet and d.  heck for support related to the corsika simulation program .",
    "it is a great pleasure to acknowledge fruitful discussions with r.  engel , j.  engler , and s.  ostapchenko as well as the encouraging support by h.  blmer ."
