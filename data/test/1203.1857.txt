    "in recent years , a variety of novel experimental approaches have enabled tests of fundamental quantum physics such as superpositions , entanglement , tunneling or quantum phase transitions in artificial devices .",
    "prominent examples hereof are quantum circuits , quantum dots or optical lattices  @xcite . apart from their fundamental relevance , quantum technologies allow realizing quantum information processors that bring along the potential of carrying out specific tasks at exponentially reduced computation time  @xcite . furthermore , quantum simulators of feynman type  @xcite , employed to simulate the dynamics of one quantum system by means of another one are a pivotal example of quantum speed - up as compared to a classical computer .",
    "while both systems share the same dynamics , the simulator offers far more configurability and is better accessible for a measurement .    generally , the possibility of observing quantum effects strongly depends on the coherence properties of the underlying system . with regard to superconducting circuit qubits ,",
    "the advantages of versatile manufacturing , detection and manipulation are paid for at the price of quite high decoherence rates as compared to trapped ions or spin qubits .",
    "one way out is given by the recently emerging field of hybrid systems  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for building hybrid systems is to combine two advantages : the addressability of artificial quantum circuits and the long coherence times of elemental systems such as nitrogen - vacancy  ( nv ) centers in diamond or in polar molecules .",
    "usually these hybrid systems are motivated by using the natural spins for building quantum memories .    in this work ,",
    "we point out an alternative application for the exploration of many - body physics such as quantum phase transitions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the localized and delocalized phases that occur in hubbard - like models such as the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) lattice  @xcite . in the localized phase",
    ", excitations are localized at individual lattice sites , whereas they are delocalized across the lattice in the delocalized phase .",
    "we propose an intriguingly simple layout for simulating a jc - lattice : we use the combination of an already experimentally well - proven flux qubit array together with a single large nv - center crystal . by means of numerical studies",
    ", we corroborate that this system exhibits localized and delocalized phases .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that these phases can be identified by monitoring the signatures of the non - equilibrium system dynamics in presence of decoherence and dissipation upon employing experimentally accessible parameters .     and a nv - center .",
    "by applying an external magnetic field , the level with spin projection @xmath0 becomes resonant with the upper qubit level .",
    "( c ) the jc - array with tunable qubit - qubit coupling . here , adjacent qubits are connected via auxiliary tunable coupler qubits .",
    "each of the qubits couples to spatially separated regions of the crystal .",
    "the coupler qubit does not couple to the spins because it is far detuned from the qubits and consquently from the nv - spins as well.[setup ] ]",
    "as the elementary unit for the jc - array we propose a hybrid combination of a flux qubit and an ensemble of independent spins , given here by the nv - centers in a diamond  @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) , the spin crystal is placed in proximity of a qubit loop .",
    "the spin - qubit zeeman interaction is mediated by the magnetic field that stems from the qubit s persistent currents .",
    "a weak external field splits the spin degeneracy so as to shift one spin transition into resonance with the qubit s transition frequency @xmath1 . reducing the spin to its two lowest levels with mutual energy spacing @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ]  ( b ) ) and applying the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) we can express the hamiltonian of an ensemble of @xmath3 spins coupled to a single flux qubit at its degeneracy point as  ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are raising and lowering operators with respect to the qubit s ( @xmath8 ) and the spins ( @xmath9 ) pauli matrices .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath10 between the qubit and the individual spins are proportional to the magnitude of the qubit s field at the spin positions  @xcite . assuming the case of a large spin ensemble with low polarization , i.e. , close to its ground state , we introduce a collective operator : i.e. with @xmath11 we set @xmath12 together with its hermitian conjugate @xmath13 , yielding approximately the bosonic commutation relation , @xmath14\\cong1 $ ] ( see appendix a ) .",
    "thus , we interpret the ensemble as an effective _ bosonic _ mode and arrive at the effective jaynes - cummings model , reading as @xmath15 it describes a collective harmonic oscillator mode being coupled to a two - level system with the interaction strength @xmath16",
    ". the collective coupling @xmath16 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath17 compared to the root mean square of the individual couplings @xmath10 , see appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "recent experiments achieved coupling strengths as strong as @xmath18{mhz}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "a general advantage of superconducting circuits is their scalability and the rich variety of coupling mechanisms that can be implemented on a chip . in particular ,",
    "arrays of flux qubits with tunable coupling strength between individual qubits have been realized using a squid or ancilla flux qubit  @xcite . in recent experiments manipulating coupling strengths _ in situ _ and the engineering of various types of circuit connectivity has become feasible  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a chain of qubits with tunable nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "this array of qubits can be readily turned into a jc - lattice of coupled qubit - oscillator systems by putting one nv - center crystal on top , as sketched with fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) . as argued above , the spin crystal adds an effective harmonic oscillator degree of freedom to each site of the array .",
    "apart from the possibility to tune the coupling between the sites of the lattice , the most appealing aspect of this hybrid architecture is simplicity .",
    "furthermore , the harmonic oscillators in the form of the spin crystal exhibit excellent coherence properties , homogeneous transition frequencies and coupling strengths , all implemented here within a reduced geometric dimension as compared to coplanar waveguide resonators .    for well - separated qubits",
    ", we can neglect their mutual inductance as well as the cross - coupling of one qubit to the spin ensemble of another site , being even one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this jc - lattice with @xmath19 sites is thus described by @xmath20 with the single - site hamiltonians @xmath21 given in eq .  . here",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the uniform qubit - qubit coupling strength and the operators @xmath23 describing the creation and annihilation of a qubit excitation at the @xmath24-th site .",
    "a subtle but salient difference between our model and previously studied jc - lattices is in the interaction mechanism between individual lattice sites . while we propose an inter - site coupling mediated by the qubits , previous works have dealt with the complementary approach where the lattice sites interact via the oscillator degrees of freedom , as in coupled cavities  @xcite or in superconducting resonators  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the coupling part of the jc - lattice hamiltonian   assumes the form @xmath25",
    "for bose - hubbard  like models the occurrence of a quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized phases has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "analogous transitions have been investigated with polaritons in jc - lattices  @xcite . here",
    ", the term polariton refers to the eigenstates @xmath26 of the single - site hamiltonian @xmath27 [ eq .  .",
    "the excitation number @xmath28 , being the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath29 , are conserved due to @xmath30=0 $ ] .",
    "similarly , the full jc lattice hamiltonian   conserves the total number of excitations in the lattice .",
    "the ground state @xmath31 has no excitations @xmath32 , while the states @xmath26 ( @xmath33 ) are each twofold degenerate with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "if the qubit and the resonator are in resonance , @xmath35 , the polaritonic states are symmetric  ( @xmath36 ) and antisymmetric  ( @xmath37 ) superpositions @xmath38 of the oscillator fock states @xmath39 and the qubit ground ( @xmath40 ) and excited ( @xmath41 ) states , respectively .     for a two - site setup ( both sites @xmath42 yield the same plot ) as a function of the inter - site coupling @xmath22 and the qubit - ensemble detuning @xmath43 .",
    "the dark shaded region indicates that the system in the localized phase , while the brighter areas are related to large fluctuations , i.e. , the delocalized phase .",
    "the two side panels depict a horizontal cut along @xmath44 and a vertical cut along @xmath45 ( i.e. , very close to qubit - oscillator resonance ) , respectively . there ,",
    "the solid black curves depict @xmath46 for the two - site setup as in the central panel . for comparison",
    ", we have included the fluctuation characteristics @xmath46 for longer jc - arrays with @xmath47@xmath48 sites in ascending order , where @xmath24 denotes a central site of the array .",
    "( b ) comparison of qq- and cc - coupled chains . in the latter ,",
    "the transition occurs at lower detunings due to higher effective coupling of polaritons between adjacent sites .",
    "this can be seen in the lower plot : changing the detuning affects both the effective repulsion @xmath49 , as well as the effective coupling @xmath50 .",
    "the transition occurs when @xmath49 and @xmath50 cross.[fig2eq ] ]    the localization - delocalization transition we consider in this work takes place for the lowest energy state in the subspace with one average excitation per site  @xcite .",
    "as we argue with appendix [ app : conservation ] , for weak inter - site coupling @xmath22 , no inter - conversion between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 polaritons occurs  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain analytical estimates , we can neglect @xmath51 polaritons and restrict our studies to @xmath52 polaritons which are lower in energy .",
    "we then introduce the `` effective repulsion '' @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 this positive - valued repulsion increases with the qubit - oscillator coupling strength @xmath16 and decreases with the detuning @xmath55 .",
    "it measures the extra energy needed to insert two polaritons into a single site as compared to distributing them across two sites .",
    "thus , a large repulsion promotes an even distribution of excitations over the lattice sites . in this case , the system eigenstate is approximately given by a product of the local single - site eigenstates @xmath56 .",
    "by contrast , a large inter - site coupling quantified by @xmath22 favors delocalized excitations , i.e. , momentum eigenstates that are given by a superposition of product states , each with different @xmath28 .",
    "thus , modifying @xmath22 or the repulsion ( e.g. by means of @xmath43 ) one ends up in two extreme regimes : the localized or the delocalized phase .    as stated at the beginning of this section ,",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : jc - array ] ) conserves the total number of excitations .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation of the excitation number in a particular lattice site , @xmath57 , is used as an order parameter in jc - lattices  @xcite . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the excitations are trapped , and the system is in a localized phase .",
    "by contrast , large fluctuations indicate the delocalized phase .    in order to investigate the transition between the localized and the delocalized phases numerically we calculate @xmath46 for a setup with two sites . as indicated in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2eq ]  ( a ) , a transition between the two different regimes characterized by zero and finite @xmath46 occurs upon a change of @xmath43 or @xmath22 .",
    "this two - site setup already exhibits the same qualitative features as longer arrays of finite length , as we corroborate in the side panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2eq](a ) .",
    "there , we compare the variance for arrays with two or more sites by means of two cross sections through the main panel for fixed values of @xmath43 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "thus , the elementary two - site setup  readily feasible with present - day experimental techniques",
    " already allows for a good qualitative estimate of the transition properties of a jc - array .",
    "experimental feasibility will be further discussed in section [ sec : exp ] .    to gain analytical insight",
    ", we express the coupling between the individual sites in terms of the relevant polaritonic basis states @xmath59 .",
    "in doing so , we can approximate @xmath60 , where the coefficients @xmath61 depend on @xmath43 , @xmath16 and @xmath28 and their explicit form is detailed in appendix  [ app : hopping ] .",
    "thus , two sites initially in the state @xmath62 are coupled with the effective strength ( see appendix [ app : hopping ] ) @xmath63 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2eq](b ) , we compare @xmath50 to the effective repulsion strength @xmath49 [ eq .  , both plotted as functions of @xmath43 at fixed @xmath22 .",
    "we find that the observed crossing point of @xmath50 and @xmath49 closely matches the location of the localization - delocalization transition .",
    "furthermore , we compare our results for a jc - array with qubit - qubit ( qq)-coupling to a similar setup with cavity - cavity ( cc)-coupling , i.e. , an array in which the individual sites interact via their oscillator degrees of freedom @xmath64 . for this latter scenario",
    ", we find that the transition to the delocalized phase already occurs at smaller @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2eq](b ) , top panel . as in the ( qq)-coupled case",
    "we calculate @xmath50 via the relevant polaritonic basis states and indeed find a larger effective inter - site interaction that hence explains the observed transition point .",
    "the interested reader can check the explicit coupling coefficients in appendix  [ app : hopping ] . with increasing detuning ,",
    "the @xmath59 polaritons become more and more bosonic , i.e. only the oscillator degree of freedom is excited , @xmath65 .",
    "this allows for a simple explanation of the different trends of @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig2eq](b ) when increasing the detuning . in a qubit - coupled array",
    ", the bosonic excitations must hop via the route oscillator - qubit - qubit - oscillator to reach the next lattice site , therefore @xmath50 is small .",
    "by contrast , in the cavity - coupled setup the bosonic excitations can hop directly to the next - site oscillator and @xmath50 is therefore larger when the excitations are purely bosonic .",
    "the characterization of localized and delocalized phases at equilibrium is helpful in exploring the physics in jc - lattices with qubit - qubit coupling and contrasting it with jc - lattices that interact with a cavity - cavity coupling .",
    "however , the assumption of staying in the subspace with one mean excitation per site is not completely realistic in practice . in particular ,",
    "non - equilibrium processes such as dissipation and decoherence are crucial in solid state devices .",
    "next we point out that the signatures of the localization - delocalization transition remain preserved even in the presence of dissipation .",
    "a corresponding measurement only requires state preparation and qubit readout .",
    "we model dissipation for both the qubit and spin ensemble by means of a quantum master equation , which for the jc lattice assumes the form ( at zero temperature )  @xcite @xmath66+\\sum_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{c}l_{a_{j}}[\\varrho(t)]+\\gamma_{q}l_{\\sigma_{j}^{-}}[\\varrho(t)]\\right)\\;.\\label{qme}\\ ] ] the lindblad dissipators @xmath67 act on the density operator @xmath68 as @xmath69=o\\rho o^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}(o^{\\dagger}o\\rho+\\varrho o^{\\dagger}o)$ ] .",

    "in summary , we have introduced a novel jc - lattice based on a hybrid combination of flux - qubits and nv - centers .",
    "in contrast to jc - lattices based on coupled cavities or superconducting resonators , the harmonic oscillator degree of freedom ( `` cavity '' ) is smaller in size than the qubit ( `` atom '' ) .",
    "this allows one to couple the individual jc - sites via the qubits instead of the harmonic oscillators .",
    "we have argued that similarly to _ cavity - coupled _ jc - lattices a localization - delocalization transition can be observed in these novel _ qubit - coupled _ jc - lattices . even though localization - delocalization transitions in jc - lattices have been proposed theoretically some time ago , they could not be observed in an experiment yet .",
    "our proposal relies on a straightforward modification of already realized flux qubit arrays by simply mounting a single nv - center crystal on top .",
    "this minimal modification of a common setup opens the possibility of studying many - body phenomena in strongly coupled hybrid architectures within state - of - the - art experimental technology .",
    "apart from its simplicity , further advantages are the possibility to investigate localization - delocalization transitions in arbitrary ( even fractal ) dimensions and to tune the inter - site coupling in - situ by using common techniques for building flux qubit networks .",

    "here we outline the approximation that allows us to express the spin ensemble by a collective bosonic operator . with homogeneous coupling for all the spins one can express the spins by a collective angular momentum operator and then apply a holstein - primakoff approximation to yield a bosonic operator .",
    "however , for inhomogeneous couplings this is not readily possible because the collective operator does not fulfill angular momentum algebra .",

    "<S> the underlying description is a jaynes - cummings - lattice in the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to well - studied coupled cavity arrays the interaction between lattice sites is mediated here by the qubit rather than by the oscillator degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , we point out that a transition between a localized and a delocalized phase occurs in this system as well . we demonstrate the possibility of monitoring this transition in a non - equilibrium scenario , including decoherence effects . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme allows the monitoring of localization - delocalization transitions in jaynes - cummings - lattices by use of currently available experimental technology . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to cavity - coupled lattices , our proposed recourse to stylized qubit networks facilitates ( i ) to investigate localization - delocalization transitions in arbitrary dimensions and ( ii ) to tune the inter - site coupling _ in - situ_. </S>"
