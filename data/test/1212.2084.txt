    "recently an interest to @xmath0-ray and @xmath1-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has substantially increased due to new observational data from satellite telescopes .",
    "investigations of cosmic objects passed to a new stage when in @xmath2 the agile ( astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ) satellite and in @xmath3 the fermi spacecraft were launched .",
    "these new observational results are of fundamental importance in studying the emission properties of several @xmath0-ray and @xmath1-ray sources , like agns , pulsars , gamma ray bursts etc .    most commonly it is believed that highly relativistic electrons do not participate in the synchrotron emission .",
    "energy losses are so efficient that particles very rapidly loose their energies and transit to the ground landau states . in spite of this , as it was shown in a series of articles by @xcite , the synchrotron radiation still might account for the radiation processes produced by very energetic particles in agns .    according to @xcite in strong magnetic fields the plasma may induce the unstable cyclotron waves . on the other hand , as it was shown by @xcite , these waves via the qld affect the particle distribution as along as across the magnetic field lines .",
    "such a feedback of cyclotron waves on particles will inevitably lead to the creation of the pitch angles , restoring the synchrotron emission . apart from agns the process of the qld",
    "was applied to pulsars as well and it was shown that the mentioned mechanism is very efficient for pulsar magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "this approach makes possible for the synchrotron radiation to be a working mechanism despite strong energy losses .",
    "a very interesting property of the qld is that it enables to produce highly correlated radiation in two different energy bands . in this process one",
    "has two major forces that influence the particle distribution function .",
    "on the one hand , the diffusion attempts to increase the values of the pitch angles of resonant particles and , and on the other hand , the emitting particles are affected by dissipative forces intending to decrease their pitch angles .",
    "it was shown in the papers listed above that under certain conditions the dissipative and diffusion factors balance each other , the physical system reaches stationary state and the pitch angles saturate .",
    "consequently , the cyclotron emission by means of the diffusion redistributes resonant particles and as a result , the synchrotron emission is produced .",
    "this mechanism guarantees strongly correlated radiation in two different energy bands .    in the framework of this emission model ,",
    "the radiation is generated in two energy bands because of the feedback of the excited cyclotron waves on particles by means of the qld , which start to radiate in the synchrotron regime .",
    "in general similar emission mechanism can be driven not only via the cyclotron waves .",
    "particularly , in the present paper , unlike the aforementioned articles , we consider the feedback of the cherenkov - drift waves on the resonant particles via the qld .",
    "this process should also switch the synchrotron radiation mechanism and must provide correlated emission in different energy domains .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the theory of the quasi - linear diffusion . in section  iii , we apply the model to agns and in section  iv , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we develop the model of the qld of particles driven by means of the feedback of the cherenkov drift modes in the magnetospheres of agns . normally , in the mentioned region , with the typical lengthscales @xmath4 , values of the lorentz factors of electrons may vary from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "this range for the lorentz factors was implied in @xcite , where where it was shown that acceleration of particles becomes extremely efficient in the light cylinder zone ( a hypothetical area , where the linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light ) due to the relativistic effects of rotation .",
    "we apply methods developed in the mentioned papers in the framework of the present article . for",
    "simplicity one can assume that the magnetosphere of agn is composed of a low energy plasma component with the lorentz factors @xmath7 , and a highly relativistic part - the beam component with @xmath8 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the synchrotron radiation is suppressed for strongly relativistic electrons .",
    "in particular , one can see that the cooling timescale of beam electrons is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron s mass , @xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 is the single particle synchrotron emission power , @xmath13 is the magnetic induction and @xmath14 is the electron s charge . by taking into account typical values of the magnetic field in an ambient close to the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , @xmath15 g , one can see that the cooling timescale varies in the following interval @xmath16s . on the other hand , close to the light cylinder zone , due to the efficient curvature drift instability , the magnetic field lines significantly twist @xcite , therefore , the lengthscale is still of the order of @xmath17 and the corresponding plasma escape timescale , @xmath18 , is of the order of @xmath19s .",
    "as we see , the synchrotron cooling timescale is much less than the kinematic timescale , therefore , in agn magnetospheres , due to the strong energy losses , particles very rapidly transit to the ground landau states resulting in the termination of the emission process .    generally speaking , as was explained by @xcite ,",
    "the necessary condition for the development of the cherenkov drift instability ( chdi ) is the presence of the beam component in plasmas .",
    "since the magnetic field lines are always curved , it is evident that the electrons will drift along a direction perpendicular to the plane of the curved magnetic field lines with the following velocity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cyclotron frequency of the particle and @xmath22 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "it is clear that for highly relativistic particles ( @xmath23 ) the drift velocity becomes significant and the chdi with the following resonance condition arises @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the longitudinal components ( along the magnetic field line ) respectively of the wave vector and the particle velocity , and @xmath27 is the wave vector s component along the drift direction .    during the process of chdi",
    "the transverse ( t ) waves might be excited , having the growth rate @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the frequency of cherenkov emission , @xmath30 is the langmuir frequency , @xmath31 is the beam number density , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the component of the wave vector along the curvature radius of magnetic field lines . throughout the paper",
    "we assume @xmath34 @xcite .    during their motion in a nonuniform magnetic field",
    "the charged relativistic particles undergo two major dissipative forces : @xmath35 - responsible for conservation of the adiabatic invariant @xcite @xmath36 and the synchrotron radiation reaction force @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are transversal and longitudinal components of the momentum , respectively .",
    "the effect of the aforementioned dissipative forces decreases the pitch angles , which inevitably causes attenuation of the corresponding synchrotron emission process .",
    "the situation drastically changes due to diffusion as along as across the magnetic field lines , since this process tries to increase the pitch angles . under certain conditions diffusion and dissipation forces might balance each other and as a result the synchrotron radiation process will be maintained .",
    "the qld influences the particle distribution function and the corresponding kinetic equation can be written as @xcite @xmath41\\textit{f } ^{0}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)\\right\\}+\\nonumber \\\\+\\frac{1}{p_{\\perp}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\left\\{p_{\\perp}\\left [      f_{\\perp}+h_{\\perp}\\right]\\textit{f } ^{0}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)\\right\\}=\\nonumber \\\\=\\frac{1}{p_{\\perp}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\left\\{p_{\\perp } d_{\\perp,\\perp}\\frac{\\partial\\textit{f } ^{0}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\right\\}+\\nonumber",

    "@xmath44 is the energy density of the excited waves and we have taken into account that @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that pitch angles @xmath46 acquired by particles during the qld are small enough to apply the condition , @xmath47 , which reduces the kinetic equation ( [ kin1 ] ) to the following form @xmath48\\textit{f } ^{0}\\right )      = \\nonumber      \\\\=\\frac{1}{p_{\\perp}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\left(p_{\\perp } d_{\\perp,\\perp}\\frac{\\partial\\textit{f } ^{0}}{\\partial p_{\\perp}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the light cylinder lengthscales one can simplify eq .",
    "( [ kin2 ] ) by estimating the ratio @xmath49 . taking into account parameters typical for the light cylinder area , one obtains @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the dimensionless angular velocity , the actual angular velocity and the maximum angular velocity of the supermassive black hole , @xmath54 is its mass",

    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) that depending on physical parameters one has two major regimes:(i ) @xmath63 ( ii ) @xmath64 .",
    "in the framework of the first approximation one can neglect its contribution of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ kin2 ] ) , which for the stationary case ( @xmath66 ) has the following solution @xmath67 where @xmath68 as we see from eq .",
    "( [ ff1 ] ) , particles are distributed differently for different values of transverse momentum , therefore , it is natural to examine the average value of @xmath39 which in turn defines the mean value of the pitch angles .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to the following expression @xmath69 and the corresponding average value of the pitch angle @xmath70 for the second case ( @xmath64 ) , the distribution function reduces to @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the corresponding mean values of the transverse momentum and the pitch angle respectively are given by @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the gamma function .",
    "as we see from the results of the previous section , the cherenkov - drift instability strongly influences the particle distribution by means of the qld and prevents the synchrotron emission . in this section",
    "we apply the developed model to agns and study the production of the nonthermal emission .    for this purpose",
    "we consider the light cylinder zone of the magnetosphere . in this area",
    "the value of the magnetic induction might be estimated in the framework of the equipartition approximation .",
    "thus , we assume that the magnetic field energy density is of the order of plasma energy density , which defines the magnetic induction @xmath76 as we see the magnetic field is quite strong and since in this area particles normally achieve very high lorentz factors , @xmath77 , the resulting synchrotron emission should be quite efficient",
    ". in particular , relativistic electrons moving in a strong magnetic field and having the pitch angles expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ pitch1],[pitch2 ] ) , will emit the photons with energies @xcite @xmath78 @xmath79    in the framework of the quasi - linear diffusion , the problem is usually treated by means of the method of iteration .",
    "it is evident that the instability has to be saturated by means of nonlinear effects ( the corresponding study is not in the scope of the paper ) and since there is some energy budget , it is clear that after the process is relaxed , the energy of waves must be of the same order of that of plasmas associated with the energy budget @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the paper we assume @xmath80 .    as a first example we consider the case when @xmath81 exceeds the corresponding component of the radiation reaction force . by combining eqs.([incr],[dkoef],[pp01],[eps1 ] ) one can study the emission characteristics . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the dependence of energy of radiated synchrotron photons on the beam electron lorentz factors for different values of @xmath7 .",

    "( [ pp01 ] ) one obtains that the pitch angles vary in the range @xmath88rad , that is in a good agreement with the assumption @xmath89 ( see eq .",
    "[ ratio ] ) .    as it is evident from the plots the photon energy is a continuously increasing function of @xmath8 , which is a natural consequence of the fact that more energetic electrons emit more energetic photons .",
    "@xmath90 has the similar behaviour with respect to the plasma component lorentz factor . by increasing @xmath7 the corresponding photon energy increases as well .",
    "in particular , by combining eqs .",
    "( [ incr],[om],[dkoef],[pp01 ] ) one can see that @xmath91 . as it is clear from the figure",
    ", the qld guarantees the emission in the kev energy domain ( @xmath0-rays ) , which in turn must be strongly correlated with the lower energy emission provided by cherenkov - drift instability . from eqs .",
    "( [ ud],[om ] ) one can obtain energy of photons corresponding to the cherenkov drift waves @xmath92    we see that for the mentioned physical parameters the cherenkov instability produces the ir photons with energies @xmath93ev , and since the qld is achieved by means of the feedback of these waves on particles , it is evident that the ir emission must be strongly connected to the soft @xmath0-ray radiation ( @xmath94)kev .",
    "generally speaking , the instability is supposed to be efficient if the corresponding growth rate is high enough . from eq .",
    "( [ incr ] ) we obtain @xmath95 it is clear that the instability timescale , @xmath96 is of the order of @xmath97s . on the other hand , particles are moving inside the magnetosphere and the kinematic timescale ( escape timescale ) @xmath98s exceeds the instability timescale , which indicates high efficiency of the cherenkov - drift mechanism .    from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) it is clear that @xmath99 is sensitive with the lorentz factor of beam components and the pitch angles ( note that @xmath46 itself nontrivially depends on @xmath8 see eqs .",
    "( [ pitch1],[pitch2 ] ) ) and hence , for other parameters the relation between forces may be different .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider another limit , ( @xmath100 ) and see what happens in this particular situation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the dependence of energy of synchrotron emission on beam lorentz factors for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath34 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84erg / s , @xmath85 $ ] , @xmath86 .",
    "the difference from the previous case is @xmath8 , which varies from @xmath101 to @xmath102 . from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) it is clear that for the mentioned parameters the following approximation , @xmath64 is satisfied . from the plots we see that @xmath90 lies in the interval @xmath103kev , which is much higher than the photon energies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] being a result of a more steep dependance @xmath104 ( see eqs.([incr],[dkoef],[pp02],[eps2 ] ) ) .",
    "since the expression of @xmath105 does not depend on the beam lorentz factors , the hard @xmath0-ray radiation is strongly connected with the corresponding cherenkov - drift emission generated in the same energy domain as in the previous case : ir band .",
    "the emission pattern strongly depends on the values of the agn luminosity .",
    "in particular , in the framework of the model , we use the equipartition magnetic field and the induction becomes dependent on @xmath59 .",
    "such a dependance is motivated by the fact that the diffusion coefficient behaves as , @xmath106 ( see eq .",
    "( [ dkoef ] ) ) which leads to @xmath107 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ pitch1],[pitch2],[eps1],[eps2 ] ) ) . on the other hand , unlike the results shown on the previous two graphs , in this case @xmath105 also depend on the agn luminosity , and since synchrotron and cherenkov - drift emission are generated simultaneously , it is interesting to investigate them both .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the behaviour of the synchrotron photon energy on the cherenkov - drift emission for different values of angular momentum . unlike the previous cases it is worthwhile to consider higher luminosity values : @xmath108\\times 10^{42}$]erg / s .",
    "we do not examine extreme luminous sources , because in this case the lorentz factors of relativistic electrons might be less than considered in the present paper .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath34 , @xmath82 , @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the synchrotron radiation reaction force is less than the force responsible for conservation of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "it is clear from the plots that @xmath113 is a continuously decreasing function , which is a direct result of the fact that with bolometric luminosity @xmath90 decreases ( @xmath114 ) , whereas the energies of cherenkov - drift photons behave as @xmath115 ( see eq .",
    "( [ lowen ] ) ) .",
    "we also show the plots for different values of angular momentum of the supermassive black hole .",
    "as it is clear , bigger the angular momentum , the bigger the resulting emission energy for both mechanisms .",
    "in particular , from eqs .",
    "( [ lowen],[dkoef],[pp02],[eps2 ] ) ) one can see that @xmath90 and @xmath105 both are increasing functions of @xmath116 .",
    "according to the present results , we see that for the mentioned parameters , the quasi - linear diffusion provides the generation of synchrotron emission from the soft up to hard @xmath0-rays : @xmath117kev .",
    "these energies are strongly connected with the cherenkov - drift emission in the energy interval @xmath118ev , corresponding to emission from ir up to extreme uv .",
    "the main aspects of the present work can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in the present paper we studied the role of cherenkov drift emission in maintaining the synchrotron regime despite the efficient energy losses .",
    "it is shown that in the magnetospheres of supermassive black holes the excited cherenkov drift instability is efficient enough to influence the particle distribution by means of the quasi - linear diffusion .",
    "3 .   in the framework of the model ,",
    "we examine equation governing the process of the qld .",
    "it is shown that for physically reasonable parameters the synchrotron radiation reaction force prevails over other dissipative factors . by taking into account this fact the corresponding kinetic equation",
    "is analytically solved and the emission characteristics are estimated 4 .",
    "the emission pattern is investigated for a variety of physical parameters .",
    "we found that for typical agns the qld might guarantee the excitation of strongly coupled cherenkov drift emission in the ev domain and the synchrotron radiation in the kev energy band .",
    "as we have already seen , the cherenkov - drift instability might guarantee the maintenance of the synchrotron emission process for a variety of agn .",
    "another important issue we would like to address is the problem of radiation spectral index , which , in some sense , will complete the problem .",
    "it is necessary to investigate this task as well , therefore , sooner or later we are going to examine it .",
