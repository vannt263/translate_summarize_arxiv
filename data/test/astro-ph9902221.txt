    "motch et al . ( 1997 ) ( hereafter m97 ) reported the discovery of several new high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these systems were found during the rosat galactic plane survey by cross - correlating the position of low - latitude x - ray sources ( @xmath2 @xmath3 20@xmath4 ) with simbad ob star catalogues .",
    "the search was restricted to stars earlier than b6 and x - ray luminosities @xmath5  10@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 . when the x - ray data were combined with optical observations",
    ", five sources remained candidates for new accreting binary systems .",
    "these sources are bsd 24491 ( rx j0440.9 + 4431 ) , ls 992 ( rx j0812.43114 ) , ls 1698 ( rx j1037.55647 , also probably 4u103656 according to m97 ) , ls 5039 ( rx j1826.21450 ) and ls i + 61 235 ( rx j0146.9 + 6121 ) . in this paper",
    "we present rxte observations of bsd 24491 and ls 1698 .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to sources by the names of the optical companion .",
    "be / x - ray binaries ( bexrbs ) and supergiant systems represent the general class of high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these are systems consisting of an early type star , the exact size forming part of the classification of the system .",
    "in addition to the normal stellar component , a compact object is also present in the system , and accretion onto it is the principal source of x - ray emission in the system .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopic observations carried out by m97 showed h@xmath8 in emission in both , bsd 24491 and ls 1698 , hence classing them as be stars . the spectral type for both sources is b0v - iiie ( m97 ) .",
    "a be star is an early type luminosity class iii - v star , which at some time has shown emission in the balmer series lines .",
    "this emission , as well as the characteristic infrared excess , is attributed to the presence of circumstellar material , most likely forming a disc around the equator of the be star .",
    "bexrbs were first identified by the presence of x - ray flares , and so were named x - ray transients .",
    "type i flares were observed to occur regularly , with a fixed period , and it was hypothesised that the systems consist of a neutron star in an eccentric orbit around the be star .",
    "this model predicts that an x - ray flare will be observed during the time of the neutron star s periastron passage , and this explains the periodicity observed in the timing of the flares .",
    "the size of the flare will be dictated by the amount of material available for accretion and by the magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "the flare occurs at periastron when the neutron star impinges on the region of denser circumstellar material surrounding the be star .",
    "bexrbs also show giant x - ray outbursts ( type ii events ) in which the x - ray luminosity increases by a factor 100 - 1000 above the quiescent level .",
    "the x - ray luminosity during the outburst may reach 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath7 , close to the eddington luminosity .",
    "these outbursts do not correlate with the orbital phase , but occur in an unpredictable way and are thought to be related to mass ejections from the be star s circumstellar envelope .",
    "it has been proposed that a subclass of bexrbs exists which are characterised by persistent , weak x - ray emission , and which do not display the type i or ii outburst behaviour .",
    "this subclass is currently represented by x persei and ls i + 61 235 ( haberl , angelini , motch and white , 1998 ) .",
    "these systems have relatively low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath7 ) and long spin periods ( 837 s x persei and 1412 s ls i + 61 235 ) . to date",
    ", these two represent the only examples of persisent bexrbs amongst the @xmath1040 known bexrb systems . for a recent summary of the observed properties of bexrbs , see negueruela ( 1998 ) .",
    "the sources were observed with the _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) in 1998 february .",
    "table 1 shows the journal of the x - ray observations .",
    "the total on - source time was 20 ks for each target .",
    "the pca covers the lower part of the energy range , 2 - 60 kev , and consists of five identical coaligned gas - filled proportional units ( pcu ) , providing a total collecting area of @xmath10 6500 @xmath12 , an energy resolution of @xmath3 18 % at 6 kev and a maximum time resolution of 1@xmath13s . for a more comprehensive description of the rxte pca see jahoda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "good time intervals were defined by removing data taken at low earth elevation angle ( @xmath3 8@xmath4 ) and during times of high particle background .",
    "an offset of only 0.02@xmath4 between the source position and the pointing of the satellite was allowed , to ensure that any possible short stretch of slew data at the beginning and/or end of the observation was removed .",
    "this screening criteria allowed us to divide the observations up into continuous sections of clean data , on which the x - ray analyses were carried out .",
    "the main objective of these observations was to search for pulsations in the x - ray flux in an attempt to confirm the accreting nature of the sources .",
    "[ tabx ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath14 dependent on luminosity ; higher values correspond to higher luminosity + @xmath15 energy range 1 - 20 kev except that of ls i+61 235 which is 0.5 - 10 kev + @xmath16 l@xmath17/l@xmath18    recently , haberl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and haberl , angelini & motch ( 1998 ) have suggested that ls i + 61 235/rx j0146.9 + 6121 may be another persistent bexrb .",
    "this source is the pulsar with the longest spin period ( @xmath10 1400 s ) . with two such systems",
    "one can look for more similarities in an attempt to establish the existence of a distinct subclass of bexrbs . comparing the x - ray observational characteristics of x per and ls i + 61 235 we find that they both share the following properties :    * long pulse periods , 837s for x per and 1404s for ls i + 61 235 * persistent , low luminosity ( @xmath110@xmath19 erg s@xmath7 ) x - ray emission * low cut - off energy derived from the spectral fitting , compared to the typical value of 10 - 20 kev found in transient x - ray pulsars  2.2 kev for x per ( schlegel et al .",
    "1993 ) and 4 kev for ls i + 61 235 ( haberl , angelini & motch 1998 ) * absent or very weak iron line at 6.4 kev , indicative of only small amounts of material in the vicinity of the neutron star * low x - ray variability .",
    "flat lightcurves with rare and unpredictable increases in flux by a factor of @xmath1 @xmath1010 * no dependence of the x - ray spectrum on intensity    if we use these general characteristics as defining a subclass of bexrbs , we find that the newly discovered systems ls 1698 and bsd 24491 are also potential members .",
    "both have been detected every time they have been observed , indicating persistent x - ray emission , and their x - ray flux is relatively low compared to that of other accreting pulsars when they are active . furthermore , both have long spin periods ( @xmath10860 s for ls 1698 , @xmath10202.5 s for bsd 24491 ) and low cut - off energies of 6.2 ( 4.7 ) and 1.9 ( 4.5 ) kev respectively - the values in brackets are obtained when an iron line is included in the fit , but this is not statistically required , again as in the cases of x per and ls i + 61 235 .",
    "we have also shown in sect [ hr ] that the hrs did not change significantly throughout the observations , indicating that the x - ray spectrum is insensitive to changes in the count rate .",
    "this absence of spectral changes with intensity was also seen in ls i + 61 235 by haberl , angellini & motch ( 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , transient bexrbs show , in general , a positive correlation between hr and intensity , as seen in ls 992 ( reig & roche 1999 ) or exo 2030 + 375 ( reig & coe 1998 ) . it is worth noting that displaying just one of this characteristics is not enough to qualify as a member of the group , but the combination is suggestive of a real association .",
    "for example , the x - ray spectrum of ls 992 also presents a low cut - off energy ( 4.7 kev ) , but it does not share any of the other x - ray properties ( reig & roche , 1999 ) . the x - ray properties of these persistent bexrbs and some examples of the transient bexrbs are compared in table 3 .",
    "it therefore seems that we now have a growing subclass of bexrbs , characterised by persistent , low - luminosity x - ray emission and slowly rotating pulsars .",
    "a possible model for these systems is that of a neutron star orbiting a be star in a relatively wide orbit , accreting material from only the low density outer regions of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "sporadic ejection of the disc itself , however , will result in the ejected material and the neutron star interacting , producing a flare in the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "the increase in flux during these flares is typically less than a factor @xmath1010 ( roche et al . 1993 ) , although further work needs to be done on characterising the range of x - ray variabilities observed in the whole range of bexrbs .",
    "note that the expelled material can reach the neutron star at any orbital phase ( not necessarily at periastron ) and that flares need not be periodic .",
    "thus , the combination of little material being accreted plus slow rotation plus possibly a relatively weak magnetic field makes these systems weak but persistent pulsing sources .    due to the low accretion rate outside of these rare events (",
    "e.g. x per has undergone only one observed episode of x - ray flaring activity in almost 30 years , associated with major changes in the circumstellar environment , roche et al . 1993 and 1997",
    "; ls i + 61 235 only 2 flares in 13 years , haberl , angelini & motch 1998 ) , the neutron star may not be spinning at the equilibrium period , and will thus not follow the relationship predicted from the corbet diagram of p@xmath20 v p@xmath21 ( corbet 1986 ; waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) .",
    "however , a long orbital period is expected , to account for the presumed distance of the neutron star from the envelope .    of these persistent systems ,",
    "only x per has been the subject of detailed , long - term study . in this case , whilst many of the physical characteristics of the system have been elucidated ( e.g. stellar parameters by lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , disc parameters by telting et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , photometric and polarimetric behaviour by roche et al .",
    "( 1997 ) etc . ) , there are still doubts about fundamental parameters such as the orbital period .",
    "none of the proposed members of this subclass has an orbital period determination , and so their position on the corbet diagram can not be ascertained .",
    "future work should therefore focus on a search for orbital variations in these objects .",
    "we have discovered two new be / x - ray pulsars which appear to display x - ray characteristics in common with the proposed subclass of persistent bexrbs currently consisting of x per and ls i + 61 235 .",
    "if the association of ls 1698 and bd 24491 with these other objects is correct , the sample of persistent bexrbs has doubled , and further observations of all these sources is encouraged to study the properties of this subclass . currently , only x per has been studied extensively for any duration , but the existence of similar systems provides us with probes of the behaviour of neutron stars in low density accretion regimes .",
    "a possible model for these systems is that of a neutron star orbiting a be star in a relatively wide orbit , accreting material from only the low density outer regions of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "small increases in x - ray luminosity ( e.g. of order 10 times the quiescent flux ) may result from mass ejection episodes where the neutron star is temporarily in a region of increased matter density .",
