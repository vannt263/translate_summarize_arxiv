    "a crucial feature of topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states @xcite .",
    "these surface states ( or _ edge states _ if the insulator is two dimensional ) have odd pairs of channels , in which each pair consists of opposite spins moving in opposite directions ( helical edge states ) .",
    "therefore , they could carry charge as well as spin currents .",
    "we are interested in studying their transport using a lattice model . in theory , one could rely on a model with external leads and reservoirs , or with a closed ring in which the currents are driven by a threading magnetic flux . in this work",
    ", we adopt the latter ( simpler ) approach , and use the graphene lattice as a theoretical model to study the transport of these important helical edge states .",
    "graphene is one of the earliest candidates of two - dimensional topological insulator ( also called quantum spin hall insulator ) @xcite .",
    "it is found that , graphene would become a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator if there is a spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) . however , since graphene s soi is only of the order of @xmath0 mev @xcite , it poses an experimental challenge to probe such a state @xcite .",
    "experimental issues aside , graphene lattice is ideal for theoretical investigation of the helical edge states . to avoid complications from pre - existing edge states ,",
    "we choose a graphene ribbon with armchair edges , which has no edge state in the absence of soi .",
    "that is , the edge states studied here are intrinsic to the qsh insulator .",
    "in contrast , a graphene ribbon with zigzag edges has edge states even without soi @xcite .",
    "these edge states would become helical edge states ( similar to those in this work ) with soi .    if the graphene ribbon is wrapped up to form a tube ( or a ring , with armchair edges ) , with a magnetic flux passing through the hole",
    ", then the helical edge state provides a robust channel for persistent charge current ( pcc ) and persistent spin current ( psc ) .",
    "pcc in a mesoscopic metal ring was first predicted @xcite , and later verified in experiments@xcite decades ago . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the pcc was measured accurately by mounting nano - rings on a micro - cantilever in an external magnetic field .",
    "in addition to pcc , the psc in a ring in a textured magnetic field @xcite , or in a ring with soi @xcite has been proposed .",
    "further researchers show that it is possible to have a psc in a ferromagnetic ring @xcite or an antiferromagnetic ring @xcite .",
    "there have been several studies of the aharonov - bohm effect and pcc in a graphene ring with different geometrical shapes ( without spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "for example , a nano - torus @xcite , flat rings ( similar to corbino - disks ) with various types of boundaries @xcite , or a tube with zigzag edges @xcite .",
    "observation of the aharonov - bohm effect is an indirect evidence of the pcc .",
    "recently , the aharonov - bohm oscillation in a nano - rod of topological insulator has been observed @xcite and studied @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of the persistent currents in a two - dimensional topological - insulator ring , which are based on an effective continuous model , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zigzag edge of a graphene sheet is found to be magnetized due to the hubbard interaction . since the time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken , edge charge current appears without the need of a driving magnetic flux .    in this paper , we study the quantum spin - hall states and the persistent currents of an armchair ring with soi .",
    "different from earlier approaches @xcite , this work is based on a lattice model , which allows insulating band structure and genuine edge states . by changing its parameters",
    ", the gaphene ring can be in or out of the qsh phase , and the behavior of the persistent currents across the phase boundary can be studied .",
    "it is found that : for a broad ribbon , the edge pcc is small ( but non - zero ) , while the edge psc approaches a finite value . for a narrow ribbon , the edge states from opposite sides couple with each other , which may open an energy gap and reduce the persistent currents .",
    "we have also considered the zeeman coupling and the rashba coupling .",
    "the former introduces addition jumps in the periodic saw - tooth curves of the persistent currents . by breaking spin conservation",
    ", the rashba coupling reduces the edge spin current , which eventually vanishes at the boundary of the qsh phase .",
    "many of the results obtained here should also apply qualitatively to the helical edge states and persistent currents of a three - dimensional topological - insulator ring .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we describe the theoretical model being used . in sec .",
    "3 we first study the helical edge states and related pcc and psc in rings with various sizes , then comment on the effects of the zeeman and the rashba interactions .",
    "4 is the conclusion .",
    "we start with a tight - binding model for a graphene ribbon .",
    "one imposes the open boundary condition with armchair edges along the @xmath1-direction , and periodic boundary condition along the @xmath2-direction ( see fig .  [ lattice ] ) . a magnetic flux @xmath3 passes through the inside of the ring along the @xmath4-direction . because of the magnetic flux , an electron circling the ribbon",

    "the hamiltonian reads @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 creates an electron at lattice site @xmath9 .",
    "the first term accounts for the nearest - neighbor hoppings .",
    "the second term is a soi with next - nearest - neighbor hoppings , in which @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two nearest - neighbor bonds that connect site-@xmath13 to site-@xmath9 , and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the third and the fourth terms are the zeeman and the rashba couplings . in the following , all energies and lengths will be in units of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( lattice constant ) respectively .    the phases @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to the magnetic flux : @xmath19 for the nearest - neighbor bonds along the @xmath2-direction ( see fig .  [ lattice ] ) , while @xmath20 for the zigzag bonds , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the number of unit cells around the ring .",
    "the phase @xmath18 is zero for the next - nearest - neighbor bonds along the @xmath1-direction , while @xmath23 for the other next - nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "these phases are chosen in such a way that the electron would pick up the correct aharonov - bohm phase when circling the ring once , no matter which path it takes .",

    "for example , the charge and spin currents for the right edge are @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .    in general , @xmath50 is the sum of edge current and bulk current .",
    "the existence of persistent _ bulk _ current in an insulator ring ( the usual type or the qsh type ) is due to the discreteness ( due to the finite circumference ) and asymmetry ( due to the magnetic flux ) of the energy spectrum . as a result",
    ", it only exists in a ring with finite radius ( with or without soi ) , and diminishes when the ring is larger . on the contrary",
    ", there is no spin - resolved current ( either bulk or edge ) in an usual insulator ring .",

    "the following path is adopted : we first show the energy spectrum and the decay length of the edge states , then present the charge and spin transport for broad ribbons ( sec .",
    "subsequently , the transport in narrow ribbons are shown and the finite - size effect discussed ( sec .",

    "the most important ones are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which dictate whether the graphene is in the qsh phase @xcite .",
    "their overall influence on edge states and spin current can be seen in figs . 3 and 10 .",
    "before showing the result , we review the energy spectrum of a _ flat _ graphene nano - ribbon with armchair edges , but without soi @xcite .",
    "first , the width of the ribbon has a major effect on the energy gap .",
    "if @xmath64 , then there is a dirac point at @xmath65 and the system is gapless in the tight - binding model . if @xmath66 , then the system has a finite gap , which approaches zero as @xmath67 becomes infinite .",
    "second , in the presence of soi , the dirac point of a ribbon with @xmath64 is opened , and mid - gap edge states are crossing at @xmath65 .",
    "similar mid - gap edge states exist for @xmath66 .       and @xmath57 .",
    "the decay length is inversely proportional to the strength of the spin - orbit interaction.,width=264 ]    in kane and mele s analysis @xcite , the graphene enters the qsh state once the soi is turned on , without a finite threshold value .",
    "therefore , the edge modes for the qsh state should immediately appear , no matter how small the soi is . in fig .",
    "[ energy_sp01 ] , we show the energy dispersion for @xmath58 and @xmath68 .",
    "overall , the energy spectrum shows intangible change from the one with @xmath69 .",
    "however , in the inset one can see that the dirac point is opened up , with mid - gap edge modes .",
    "the edge modes do not merge into bulk bands up to near the boundaries of the brillouin zone .",
    "the envelope of the probability distribution for the edge state decays exponentially , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the distance from the edge . as one increases the soi ,",
    "the edge states should be more localized . in fig .",
    "[ decay_length ] , we show the decay length @xmath72 of the edge state at the dirac point for different values of @xmath61 . upon fitting ,",
    "the inverse of the decay length is about @xmath73 , proportional to the soi .",
    "for example , for @xmath74 , the decay length is about 17 sites ( 3 sites ) . with this result",
    ", one can estimate whether , for a given ribbon , the inter - edge coupling could be safely neglected .    at first",
    ", we report the pcc _ without _ soi . in this case , the current is from bulk states only since there is no edge mode .",
    "the pccs are shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ pc_tot ] . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", there is a dirac point in the energy spectrum when @xmath64 .",
    "the discontinuity of the slopes at the dirac point produces the finite jump at zero flux for @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "systems with @xmath66 are gapped ( without the dirac point ) , so the pccs show no jump for @xmath76 . furthermore , the overall magnitude of the pcc is also much smaller .",
    "the plots for the pccs _ with _ soi are shown on the right of fig .",
    "[ pc_tot ] .",

    "[ pc_tot ] , the sinusoidal - like variations on the left become sawtooth - like on the right , and have much larger magnitudes ( similar to the system with @xmath75 ) .",
    "this , of course , is due to the energy level crossing of the newly formed edge - modes .     and @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath79 is large , the edge persistent current has a smaller discontinuity but the overall magnitude remains close to one.,width=415 ]    we now focus on the edge _ spin _ current in the presence of soi .",

    "[ pc_tot ] . however , in fig .",
    "[ pc_edge ] , the sawtooth curves ride on background values of @xmath80 ( i.e. opposite spins move along opposite directions ) .",
    "therefore , it is a more stable transport with respect to the change of magnetic flux . as @xmath79 gets larger , even though the jump is smaller , the overall magnitudes of these currents remain close to one .",
    "a few symmetries can be observed in fig .",
    "[ pc_edge ] .",
    "for example , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "also , @xmath83 , similarly for the left edge .",

    "the spin current for the right edge , @xmath56 , is roughly of value @xmath86 ( in units of @xmath87 ) .    in the figure , the persistent spin current is nonzero even if there is no magnetic flux .",
    "such a current , unlike persistent charge current , does not require the breaking of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "however , the edge states being helical is essential . furthermore , since the magnitude of the edge spin current is not reduced in a larger ring ( in contrast to pcc ) , it is possible to have it in a large ring ( if phase coherence around the ring could be preserved ) . for a flat sheet with open boundary ( and no external bias ) , the edge spin current can not persist .",
    "a continuous spin circulation without external driving force is possible only in a ring - like structure . in principle",
    ", the moving spins would induce an electric dipole @xcite ( might be oscillating in time ) that can be felt . in practice , detecting such an induced electric field remains a great experimental challenge .",
    "as the ribbon becomes narrower , the edge states on the two sides will couple with each other @xcite .",
    "such a coupling may open the dirac point ( when @xmath66 ) at the fermi energy .",

    ". there could be remnant spin currents along the left and the right edges , but they would cancel each other . for small widths ( the left column ) , the currents for @xmath66 can barely be seen @xcite .",

    "[ energy_gap ] .",
    "the case of @xmath88 is special since the dirac point remains closed .",
    "such a dramatic contrast is less apparent in the right column .",
    "the analysis so far applies to the cases when the electron in the ring feels the aharonov - bohm effect through the vector potential of the magnetic flux , but not the magnetic field itself . in the following ,",
    "we consider a more realistic situation when the graphene ring itself is immersed in a magnetic field . as a result",
    ", the electrons can couple with the field through their spins .",
    "some order - of - magnitude estimate is in order : for a ring with @xmath79-sites , the cross - sectional area is @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . in order to have one flux quantum inside the ring ,",
