    "the search for solar - like oscillations in stars has experienced a tremendous growth in recent years ( see @xcite , for a summary ) .",
    "most of the results came from high - precision doppler measurements using spectrograph such as coralie , harps , ucles , uves . in particular , recent measurements obtained with the sarg spectrograph have led to the determination of frequencies , mode amplitudes , lifetime and granulation noise on procyon a @xcite , a star for which the nature of oscillation spectrum is still debated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the detection of excess of power , providing evidence for oscillations , in the g5 subgiant ( hr  6623 , @xmath4 , g5  iv ) , a slightly evolved solar - type star with mass @xmath5 , effective temperature @xmath6 , and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out over seven nights ( 2006 june 1319 ) with the high resolution cross dispersed echelle spectrograph sarg ( @xcite ) mounted on the italian 3.6 m telescope tng at la palma observing station .",
    "our spectra were obtained at @xmath8 in the wavelength range between 462 and @xmath9 , where the calibration iodine absorbing cell covers only the blue part of the spectrum ( from 462 up to @xmath10 ) .",
    "exposure times were typically 60s , with a dead - time of 55s between exposures due to the readout time .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for most spectra was in the range from 200 to 400 , depending on the seeing and extinction . in total , 1106 spectra were collected , with the following distribution over the seven nights : 27 , 106 , 183 , 186 , 180 , 226 , 198 .",
    "the first two nights were affected by poor weather and technical problems .",
    "the extraction of radial velocities from the echelle spectra was based on the method described by @xcite . the observed spectrum",
    "was fitted with a reconstructed one , by using a convolution between the oversampled stellar template , the very high resolution iodine cell spectrum and the measured spectrograph instrumental profile .",
    "essential to this process are the template spectra of taken with the iodine cell removed from the beam , and of the iodine cell itself superimposed on a rapidly rotating b - type star , which was the same for all the measurements .",
    "the resulting velocity measurements of are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "they have been corrected to the solar system barycenter and no other correction , such as decorrelation or high - pass filtering has been applied .",
    "the rms scatter of these measurements is 2.53 and the uncertainties for the velocity measurements were estimated from residuals in the radial velocity extraction procedure and are shown in the upper panel of figure .",
    "[ fig1 ] where it can be noticed that most lie in the range 12 , except for the second night where technical problems due to the guiding system occurred .",
    "the amplitude spectrum of the velocity time series was calculated as a weighted least - squares fit of sinusoids @xcite , with a weight being assigned to each point according to its uncertainty estimate obtained from the radial velocity measurement .",
    "we have then optimized the weight following the approach discussed in @xcite .",
    "this consists in ( i )  cleaning all power at low frequencies ( below 250 ) from the time series , as well as all power from oscillations ( 8001800 ) ; and ( ii )  searching these residuals for points that deviated from zero by more than it would be expected from their uncertainties .",
    "we found that 20 data points needed to be significantly down - weighted .",
    "2 shows a pronounced excess of power in the power spectrum ( ps ) around 1.2mhz which is the clear signature of @xmath11-modes oscillations for a g5 subgiant star .",
    "this feature is apparent in the power spectra of individual nights , and its frequency and amplitude are in agreement with theoretical expectations , as we shall discuss .",
    "moreover , it is clearly disentangled from the low frequency increase due to slow instrumental drifts ( @xmath12 behavior in the amplitude spectrum ) and the high frequency white noise . in particular , we find that the mean noise level in the amplitude spectrum in the range 35mhz is @xmath13 which correspond to a mean noise level in the ps of 0.013 . since this is based on 1106 measurements , we can deduce that the velocity accuracy on the corresponding timescales is 1.82 .",
    "the mode frequencies for low - degree , high radial order @xmath11-mode oscillations in sun - like stars are reasonably well approximated by the asymptotic relation ( @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are integers which define the radial order and angular degree of the mode , respectively ; @xmath17 ( the so - called large frequency separation ) reflects the average stellar density , @xmath18 is sensitive to the sound speed gradient near the core , and @xmath19 is a quantity of the order unity sensitive to the surface layers . note that @xmath18 is the so - called small frequency separation between adjacent modes with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    on attempting to find the peaks in our power spectrum matching the asymptotic relation , we were severely hampered by the single - site window function .",
    "as is well known , daily gaps in a time series produce aliases in the power spectrum at spacings @xmath22 and multiples , which are difficult to disentangle from the genuine peaks .",
    "various methods for the search of regular series of peaks have been discussed in the literature , such as autocorrelation , comb response and histograms of frequencies .",
    "we used the comb response function method where a comb response function @xmath23 is calculated for all sensible values of @xmath17 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in particular we used the following function : @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{2^{n-1 } } } \\label{cr } \\ ] ] so that a peak in the @xmath25 at a particular value of @xmath17 indicates the presence of a regular series of peaks in the ps , centered at @xmath26 and having a spacing of @xmath27 .",
    "it differs from a correlation function as the product of individuals terms is considered rather than the sum .",
    "moreover it generalizes the @xmath25 defined in @xcite including ( and down - weighting ) four outermost additional frequencies so that it better detects the presence of a regular series of peaks as we checked in simulated power spectra .    to reduce the uncertainties due to the noise , only frequencies with amplitude greater than @xmath28 in the amplitude spectrum , in the frequency range @xmath29 , have been used to compute the @xmath25 [ cr ] .",
    "we then determined the local maxima of the response function @xmath23 in the range @xmath30 and the resulting cumulative comb response function , obtained by summing the contributions of all the response functions , had the most prominent peak at @xmath31 as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    the large separation @xmath17 scales approximately with the square root of the mean density of the star ( @xcite ) and by extrapolating from the solar case ( @xmath32 ;",
    "see @xcite ) one obtains @xmath33 where the error derives from the uncertainties on the radius quoted in @xcite .",
    "since we searched over the entire range 4080 , the agreement between observation and theory is encouraging .",
    "we tried to extract the oscillation frequencies directly from the ps by using the modified extraction method described in @xcite and recently used in @xcite : for each frequency @xmath26 extracted in the step before , a frequency region of @xmath34 width centered on @xmath35 , with @xmath36 was selected .",
    "when this region contained a peak with an amplitude greater or equal than @xmath37 in the amplitude spectrum we identified this peak as the second component to be cleaned , and recomputed the ps for each @xmath15 .",
    "the advantage of using this approach is that the extracted frequencies are determined except for the same day - night alias shift for each group of frequencies extracted during the procedure . in order to identify the individual frequencies of the modes we then constructed echelle diagrams corresponding to values of the large separation around @xmath38 , so that we could easily identify the ridges of the @xmath39 and then those of @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to see if there are additional frequencies , not following the comb - like structure , which where not found with the modified extraction .",
    "we thus analyzed the spectrum of the residuals obtained with the modified extraction , as shown in the upper panel of fig .  4 , and we found 5 additional frequencies with amplitude @xmath41 namely , @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these frequencies can be of stellar origin but can also be spurious peaks due to the noise or due to the non - linearity of the extraction procedure . on the other hand it is possible to note that that @xmath47 can be identified with an @xmath48 mode and @xmath49 can be identified with a @xmath50 mode .",
    "the left panel of table  1 shows the identified frequencies according with the modified extraction .",
    "it should be noticed that although we define a peak to be significant if its amplitude is greater or equal than @xmath37 in the amplitude spectrum , in table  1 we have included one frequency with amplitude @xmath51 as this frequency appears also with the standard extraction method ( see below ) and with an higher signal to noise ratio .",
    "the large and small frequency separation and the constant @xmath19 have thus been determined by means of a least square best fit with the asymptotic relation ( [ uno ] ) for all the identified modes by means of the modified extraction , which provided us with : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the expected position of the modes according to this solution is depicted with dashed lines in the left panel of figure  5 while figure  6 shows a close - up of the power spectrum with the identified frequencies according with the modified extraction .    as deviations from eq .",
    "( 1 ) could be expected for @xmath55 in the case of avoided crossings ( @xcite ) , it is important to check that the standard iterative sine - wave fitting leads to a consistent identification .",
    "we thus extracted iteratively all the frequencies with amplitude greater than @xmath56 and tried to construct an echelle diagram by searching in the range @xmath57 .",
    "it turned out that only with @xmath58 it was possible to clearly see the ridge corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "it was then straightforward to identify the @xmath60 mode , except for two frequencies , namely @xmath61 , @xmath62 which could not be identified .",
    "the ps of the residuals in shown in the lower panel of fig .  4 while the resulting echelle diagram is depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "a synoptic view of the extracted frequencies with the two methods is then presented in table  1 where the frequencies extracted according with the modified extraction ( left ) are compared with those obtained with the standard extraction ( right ) .",
    "it is reassuring to notice that 11 frequencies have the same identification in both approaches .",
    "in particular the identification of the @xmath59 ridge appears to be quite robust , and indeed one can see in fig .  5 that the echelle diagrams obtained with the modified extraction ( left ) and the standard extraction ( right ) are essentially the same ; this result suggests that we have correctly detected the large separation in this star .    in table  1",
    "the error on frequencies is reported in parentheses .",
    "in particular we have used the analytical estimates @xmath63    @xcite where @xmath64 is the number of data points , @xmath65 is the total duration of the run in days and @xmath66 is the mean error of the data .",
    "note that @xmath67 represents the noise of the amplitude spectrum after pre - withening and @xmath68 is the inverse of the @xmath69 ratio .",
    "however the errors given by these formulae represent a lower limit to the real error @xcite .",
    "in particular the actual errors can be several times larger up to a factor @xmath70 ( note that the formal resolution is @xmath71 ) .    the large and small frequency separation and the constant @xmath19",
    "have thus been determined by means of a least square best fit with the asymptotic relation ( [ uno ] ) for all the identified modes , which provided us with : @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the expected position of the modes according to this solution is depicted with dashed lines in figure  4 .",
    "figure  5 shows a close - up of the power spectrum with the identified frequencies according with the modified extraction .",
    "the strongest peaks in the amplitude spectrum of ( square root of power ) reach about 0.9 . however , these are likely to have been strengthened significantly by constructive interference with noise peaks . as stressed by @xcite the effects of the noise must be taken into account when estimating the amplitude of the underlying signal . in order to estimate the average amplitude of the modes we used the result of @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , where the effect of the noise is estimated . by considering the five strongest peaks we found a mean amplitude of the @xmath11-mode peak power , for the modes with @xmath2 in the frequency interval @xmath75 , of @xmath76 .",
    "the observed amplitudes are thus in good agreement with the theoretical amplitudes obtained by @xcite for which @xmath77 ( see also the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that the frequency of excess of power ( 1.2mhz ) is consistent with the value expected from scaling the acoustic cutoff from the solar case .",
    "our observations of show an evident excess of power in the ps , clearly disentangled from the low frequency increase , and with a position and amplitude that are in agreement with expectations .",
    "although hampered by the single - site window , the comb analysis and the echelle diagram show clear evidence for regularity in the peaks at the spacing expected from asymptotic theory .",
    "moreover , our results provide valuable confirmation that oscillations in solar - like stars really do have the amplitudes that scales as @xmath78 by extrapolating from the sun .",
    "we hope that in the near future a multi - site observing campaign will allow us to explore further the oscillation spectrum of .",
