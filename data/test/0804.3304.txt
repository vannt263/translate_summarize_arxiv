    "in the past decades , raman spectroscopy@xcite techniques were successfully applied to carbon compounds , such as graphite ( see ref",
    ".   and references therein ) and carbon nanotubes.@xcite upon the discovery of graphene,@xcite raman spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool to identify the number of layers , structure , doping , disorder , and to characterize the phonons and electron - phonon coupling.@xcite so far , most of the attention was focused on the position and width of the raman peaks .    here",
    "we present a detailed calculation of the _ intensities _ of the multiphonon raman peaks in graphene .",
    "raman scattering involves an electron - hole pair as an intermediate state ; we show that the multiphonon raman peaks are strongly sensitive to the dynamics of this electron - hole pair . thus , raman scattering can be used as a tool to probe this dynamics .",
    "writing the low - energy hamiltonian of the interaction of electrons with the crystal vibrations and the electromagnetic field from pure symmetry considerations , we describe the system in terms of just a few independent coupling constants , considered to be parameters of the theory .",
    "the electron scattering rate is introduced phenomenologically as another parameter .",
    "the results of the present calculation are used to extract information about these parameters from the raman peak intensities , measured experimentally .",
    "as shown below , the raman intensities strongly depend on the electron scattering rate ; moreover , the electron - phonon and electron - electron contributions to this rate can be separated .",
    "this is especially important as there are very few techniques giving experimental access to electron scattering rates , which , in turn , determine the transport properties of graphene samples .",
    "besides , the quasiclassical character of the process imposes a severe restriction on the electron and hole trajectories which can contribute to the two - phonon raman scattering : upon the phonon emission the electron and the hole must be scattered backwards .",
    "this restriction results in a significant polarization memory : it is almost three times more probable for the scattered photon to have the same polarization as the incidend photon than to have the orthogonal polarization .",
    "also , the raman intensities depend on electron - phonon coupling constants ; to reproduce the experimental results , one has to take into account renormalization of these coupling constants by electron - electron interaction .",
    "this renormalization is missed by local or semi - local approximations to the density - functional theory , typically used for the _ ab initio _ calculation of the coupling constants .",
    "since graphene is a non - polar crystal , raman scattering involves electronic excitations as intermediate states : the electromagnetic field of the incident laser beam interacts primarily with the electronic subsystem , and emission of phonons occurs due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the matrix element of the process can be schematically represented as    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the initial state of the process ( the incident photon with a given frequency and polarization , and no excitations in the crystal ) , @xmath2 is the final state ( the emitted photon and @xmath3  phonons left in the crystal ) , while  @xmath4 , @xmath5 , label the intermediate states where no photons are present , but an electron - hole pair is created in the crystal and @xmath6  phonons have been emitted .",
    "@xmath7  and  @xmath8 , @xmath5 are the energies of these states , and @xmath9 is the inverse lifetime of the electron ( hole ) due to collisions .",
    "@xmath10  and  @xmath11 stand for the terms in the system hamiltonian describing interaction of electrons with the electromagnetic field and with phonons , respectively .",
    "in the calculations we do not include the phonon broadening , assuming the phonon states to have zero width .",
    "first , this approximation is consistent with the available experimental information : the phonon width is about @xmath12 at most,@xcite while the electronic broadening is at least an order of magnitude higher ( see the discussion below , sec .  [ sec:2intensities ] ) .",
    "second , this approximation is irrelevant provided that we calculate the integrated intensities of the raman peaks , since they are determined by the total spectral weight of the phonon state which does not depend on the phonon broadening .",

    "vertical solid arrows represent interband electronic transitions accompanied by photon absorption or emission ( photon wave vector is neglected ) , dashed arrows represent phonon emission , the horisontal dotted arrow represents the impurity scattering.,width=264 ]    the photon wave vector is negligible , so momentum conservation requires that the sum of the wave vectors of emitted phonons must vanish ( provided that the impurity scattering is neglected ) . for",
    "the same reason raman scattering on one intervalley phonon must be impurity - assisted [ process  ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] , giving rise to the so - called @xmath13  raman peak ] .",
    "@xmath13  peak is absent in the experimental raman spectrum of graphene,@xcite showing that impurity scattering is indeed negligible in these samples .",
    "looking at the intermediate electronic states involved in the raman scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) , we notice that for one - phonon scattering [ processes ( a ) ,  ( b ) ] at least one intermediate state must be virtual , since energy and momentum conservation can not be satisfied simultaneously in all processes .",
    "thus , at least one of the factors in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ ramanmatrixelement= ] ) must be of the order of the phonon frequency  @xmath14 [ for the impurity assisted scattering one of the electron - phonon matrix elements in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ ramanmatrixelement= ] ) should be replaced by the electron - impurity matrix element ] .",
    "for the two - phonon scattering [ process  ( c ) ] all intermediate states can be real , so that all energy mismatches in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ ramanmatrixelement= ] ) can be nullified simultaneously and the result is determined by the electron scattering rate  @xmath9 .",
    "we emphasize the qualitative difference between the _ fully resonant _",
    "process  ( c ) and the double - resonant@xcite process  ( b ) , where one intermediate state is still virtual",
    ". we also note the analogous difference between the two - phonon processes ( c )  and  ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] : only the process  ( c ) is fully resonant , the other one involves an energy mismatch of @xmath15 . as a result",
    ", its amplitude will be smaller by a factor @xmath16 .",
    "obviously , these arguments can be extended to all multi - phonon processes with odd and even number of phonons involved : in order to annihilate radiatively , the electron and the hole must have opposite momenta ; if the total number of emitted phonons is odd , the electron and the hole must emit a different number of phonons , which is incompatible with energy conservation in all processes",
    ". our main focus will thus be on even - phonon processes , as their intensities are determined by the electronic scattering .",
    "the full resonance picture presented above assumes the mirror symmetry between the electron and the hole spectra .",
    "the electron - hole asymmetry can be included as a correction to the dirac spectrum : the electron and the hole energies can be written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18  is the momentum counted from the dirac point , @xmath19  is the dirac velocity , and @xmath20  is the asymmetry parameter .",
    "the energy scale  @xmath21 , quantifying the role of the asymmetry in the raman scattering is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23  and  @xmath24 are the frequencies of the incident and the scattered photon ( the details are given in secs .",
    "[ sec : warping ] ,  [ sec : intdev ] ) .",
    "namely , the arguments of the previous paragraph hold if @xmath25 . in the opposite case , it is @xmath21 that determines the smallest value of the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ ramanmatrixelement= ] ) .",
    "we will always assume that both @xmath26 .    in the real space , the typical size of the region of space probed by the electron - hole pair in the fully resonant two - phonon raman scattering ,",
    "is @xmath27 . for the doubly resonant defect - induced one - phonon scattering ,",
    "the inverse energy mismatch  @xmath28 determines the time duration of the process by virtue of the uncertainty principle , so the length scale of the process in the real space is @xmath29 .",
    "although this length scale is much shorter than @xmath30 , it is still much greater than the lattice constant or the electron wavelength @xmath31 .",
    "the fully resonant raman scattering , where the energy is conserved in each of the elementary scattering processes , admits a simple quasiclassical description , described qualitatively in this subsection , and justified rigorously in secs .  [ sec:2raman],[sec:4raman ] .",
    "let us denote by  @xmath32 the energy of the electron and the hole in the photoexcited pair .",
    "initially , it is given by the half of the excitation frequency  @xmath23 , @xmath33 .",
    "after the emission of @xmath3  phonons it is decreased by  @xmath34 ; assuming @xmath35 , we neglect this decrease in the qualitative considerations .",
    "thus , during all the time taken by the raman scattering , electron and hole can be viewed as wave packets of the size @xmath36 , propagating across the crystal along classical trajectories .",
    "the electron and the hole are created in the same region of space of the size @xmath36 around some point  @xmath37 at the moment of the arrival of the excitation photon . at this initial moment",
    "they have opposite momenta @xmath38 , and opposite velocities @xmath39 ( if the electron - hole asymmetry is taken into account , the two velocities will have slightly different magnitude ) , so they move along the straight lines , their positions being @xmath40 , @xmath41 . after a typical time",
    "@xmath42 they undergo some scattering processes ( e.  g. , phonon emission ) , where their momenta and ( generally speaking ) energies are changed .",
    "each such elementary scattering process occurs during a short time @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the trajectories of the electron and the hole after their creation are represented by broken lines , with the typical segment length @xmath44 ( the electron mean free path ) .",
    "the crucial point is that in order to recombine radiatively and contribute to raman signal , the electron and the hole should meet again within a spatial region of the size @xmath36 , and have opposite momenta .",
    "the latter condition automatically implies that the number of the phonons emitted by the electron and the hole is the same .",
    "these considerations are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .    in the presence of a significant electron - hole asymmetry , @xmath45 , the described picture is modified .",

    "( [ ramanmatrixelement= ] ) is of the order of the whole electronic bandwidth .",
    "thus , the raman process , responsible for the @xmath48  peak , is completely off - resonant and the picture shown in fig .",

    "these arguments would predict the width of the peak to be of the order of @xmath76 , where @xmath77  is the @xmath50  phonon group velocity ; besides , the shape of the peak would be strongly asymmetric : a sharp cutoff on the high - energy side at the frequency @xmath78 due to the resonance restriction , and a smooth drop - off towards zero at @xmath79 due to the matrix element suppression . the phonon dispersion can be deduced from the dependence of the frequency of the impurity - assisted one - phonon @xmath13  peak in graphite on the excitation energy  @xmath23 : @xmath80.@xcite thus , for @xmath81  ev these arguments give the width of the @xmath67  peak to be about @xmath82  @xmath72 .",

    "the small deviations of the scattering angle from  @xmath85 are restricted by the quantum diffraction , and the width of the two - phonon raman peaks , instead of being @xmath86 , is determined by a much smaller energy scale ( see the discussion below ) .",

    "a detailed study of these effects would require introduction of additional parameters into the theory , so we prefer to postpone such study for the future work .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that the _ integrated _ intensity of the peaks , which is the main focus of the present study , does not depend on these details .    in view of the results of the present paper",

    "the intensity  @xmath112 , if determined by the electron inelastic lifetime , should be sensitive to the concentration of carriers . indeed ,",
    "in the intrinsic graphene at low temperatures the photoexcited carriers do not participate in electron - electron collisions , as the phase space volume is restricted.@xcite as the carriers are added to the system , the electron - electron collisions become possible , thus the total  @xmath115 increases , and the intensity  @xmath112 is decreased , in qualitative agreement with the observation of ref .  .",
    "the motivation to study the four - phonon raman process comes from the following picture for the fully resonant processes .",
    "the incident photon creates an electron and a hole ",
    "real quasiparticles which can participate in various scattering processes .",
    "if the electron emits a phonon with a momentum  @xmath99 , the hole emits a phonon with the momentum @xmath100 , and after that the electron and the hole recombine radiatively , the resulting photon will contribute to the two - phonon raman peak .",
    "if they do not recombine at this stage , but each of them emits one more phonon , and they recombine afterwards , the resulting photon will contribute to the four - phonon peak , _ etc .",
    "_ three - phonon processes , not being fully resonant , are not interesting in this context .",
    "besides phonon emission and radiative recombination , electron and hole are subject to other inelastic scattering processes , which can also be viewed as emission of some excitations of the system . in principle",
    ", raman spectrum should also contain the contrubution from these excitations , which are left in the system after the radiative recombination of the electron and the hole .",
    "the key point is that for real quasiparticles , the probability to undergo a scattering process  @xmath116 is determined by the ratio of corresponding scattering rate @xmath117 to the total scattering rate @xmath118 , not by the history .",
    "this probability determines the relative _ frequency - integrated _ intensity of the corresponding feature in the raman spectrum .",
    "thus , the ratio of integrated intensity @xmath119 of the raman peak corresponding to @xmath120 @xmath50  phonons to that for @xmath121 @xmath50  phonons ( @xmath122 ) must be proportional to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the rate of emission of each of the two @xmath50  phonons , and the square comes from the phonon emission by the electron and the hole .",
    "this conclusion depends weakly on the relation between @xmath115  and  @xmath21 , only through a logarithmic factor .    in the doped graphene ,",
    "the most obvious competitor of the phonon emission is the electron - electron scattering : the optically excited electron can kick out another one from the fermi sea , i.  e. , to emit another electron - hole pair .",
    "thus , raman spectrum should contain contribution from electron - hole pairs ; however , their spectrum extends all the way to the energy of the photo - excited electron ( optical energy ) in a completely featureless way .",
    "thus , it can not be distinguished from the parasitic background which is always subtracted in the analysis of raman spectra , and can not be seen in the raman spectrum directly .",
    "however , assuming @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the rate of emission of phonons from the vicinity of the @xmath60  point of the first brillouin zone , and @xmath127 is the electron - electron collision rate , one can extract the value of @xmath128 , relative to phonon emission rates from the experimental data .",
    "more precisely , in this way one obtains the rate of all inelastic scattering processes where the electron loses energy far exceeding the phonon energy .",

    "in addition , interaction with only one phonon mode is dominant , so the ratios of subsequent peaks are represented by a sequence of fixed numbers .",
    "the simple band structure ( one valley for cds in contrast to two valleys for graphene ) allowed a calculation of the whole sequence .",

    "the only parameter characterizing the electron spectrum is the nearest - neighbor electronic matrix element  @xmath144 , and the electron - phonon interaction is characterized by its change with the bond length , @xmath145 . in this model",
    "we obtain @xmath146 to be given by the inverse ratio of the corresponding phonon frequencies , about  1.2 ; the same result up to a few percent is obtained from the density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations of ref .  .",
    "at the same time , by comparing the experimentally measured intensities of the different two - phonon peaks , and using the result of our calculation performed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2raman ] , we can independently extract the ratio of the coupling constants . according to the data of ref .  , @xmath147 , which gives @xmath148 .",
    "to explain this discrepancy we first analyzed the effect of the electronic trigonal band warping , which affects @xmath112 and @xmath141 differently .",
    "the corresponding calculation is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : warping ] . for @xmath81",
    "ev , we estimate the relative contribution of the warping term as @xmath149 for  @xmath112 and @xmath150 for  @xmath141 , which is far too little to account for the observed ratio @xmath151 . we are thus led to the conclusion that the observed ratio @xmath151 must be due to the difference of the coupling constants , not accounted for by the dft calculation .",
    "a similar conclusion about the insufficiency of the dft calculation of the electron - phonon coupling constants has been drawn in ref .  , where an attempt was made to explain the experimental data obtained by arpes@xcite using the results of the dft calculation .",
    "at the same time , we should note that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath143 for the phonons near the @xmath60  point , as calculated by dft@xcite ( @xmath152 ) , agrees reasonably well with the measured one : the measurements of the linear in the wave vector  @xmath108 term in the phonon dispersion ( kohn anomaly due to electron - phonon interaction ) , @xmath153 , give @xmath154 ( see ref .  ) ; the measurements of the dependence of the phonon frequency @xmath14 on the electron fermi energy  @xmath155 : @xmath156 give @xmath157 ( ref .  )",
    "@xmath158 ( ref .  ) .",
    "we show that the difference between the ratio @xmath148 extracted from the raman peak intensities , and @xmath159 obtained by the dft calculation,@xcite is due to the part of coulomb interaction between electrons , not picked up by the dft when local approximations are used for the exchange - correlation functional , such as the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , namely , logarithmic renormalizations.@xcite coulomb interaction has been known to be a source of logarithmic renormalizations for dirac fermions.@xcite coulomb renormalizations in graphene subject to a magnetic field have been considered in ref .  ,",
    "coulomb effect on static disorder has been studied in refs .  .",
    "essentially , the idea of the renormalization of the coupling constants is that the matrix element of the electron - phonon interaction should be taken not between the non - interacting electronic states , but between the states dressed by the coulomb interaction .",
    "if the typical electronic energy in the problem is  @xmath32 ( @xmath160 in the case of raman scattering ) , the renormalization is determined by the coulomb interaction at all length scales from the shortest ones ( lattice constant ) to the electron wavelength @xmath31 .",
    "it is this long - range part of the exchange and correlation that is missed by the local approximations in the dft calculation , which take into account correctly only the short - range correlations ( at the distances of the order of the lattice constant ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : coulombrg ] we calculate the renormalization of the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constants ( a preliminary account of this work was given in the short paper@xcite ) , and show that the coupling constant  @xmath143 for the phonons near the @xmath60  point is not renormalized ( hence the agreement between the value of  @xmath143 calculated by the dft and measured in the experiments , as mentioned above ) , while the coupling constant  @xmath142 for the phonons near the @xmath161  point , which is responsible for the @xmath67  raman peak , is enhanced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "this enhancement depends on the electronic energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgflow ] . for the electronic energy @xmath162",
    "this enhancement is in quantitative agreement with the measured ratio @xmath151 , provided that the screening of the coulomb interaction by the substrate is weak . the dependence of the enhancement on the electronic energy translates into the dependence of @xmath151 on the excitation frequency , which can be checked experimentally .",
    "similarly , as the coulomb interaction is screened by the substrate with a dielectric constant  @xmath163 ( its high - frequency value ) , the dependence of @xmath151 on  @xmath163 can also serve as an experimental check of the theory .",
    "we also show in sec .",
    "[ sec : phononrg ] that the electron - phonon coupling itself is a source of logarithmic renormalizations .",
