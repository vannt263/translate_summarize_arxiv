    "the coherent distortions of background galaxy images by the intervening metric perturbations provide us a direct probe of the large scale mass distribution ( see reviews by @xcite ) . recently",
    ", several groups have claimed positive detections of the weak lensing effect and obtained useful constraints on the cosmological model ( @xcite ) . in future weak lensing observations",
    "( vst - kids , des , vista darkcam , pan - starrs , lsst , dune , snap , jdem ) , if the photometric redshift can be well calibrated , we will be able to study the dark energy properties ( its abundance and equation of state ) using the redshift dependence of the shear fields ( @xcite ) . by constraining the growth factor of the mass perturbation and the geometrical distance as functions of redshift separately , weak",
    "lensing provides a consistency check of the cosmological model ( @xcite ) , and opens a window for testing alternative gravity theories ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important and challenging job in weak lensing is to measure the weak cosmic shear ( of order a few percent ) from the shapes ( or ellipticities ) of the background galaxy images , which have large intrinsic variations .",
    "the existing methods are all based on convoluting the galaxy images with some weighting functions , and are called the integral methods hereafter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the integral methods typically have disadvantages in three aspects : * 1 . *",
    "since the galaxy images are smeared by the psf ( either instrumental or environmental ) , the integral methods involve at least two folds of convolutions , the math of which is complicated ; * 2 . *",
    "the details of the methods are often sensitive to the galaxy morphology and the form of the psf ; * 3 . * the shear information from the shape distortions of galaxy substructures is not considered . strictly speaking",
    ", the shapelets method ( see , , refregier 2003 ) may not be called an integral method , because the galaxy weighting functions form a complete set of orthonormal shapelets which have very convenient mathematical properties .",
    "it also has the potential of measuring the cosmic shears on galaxy substructures .",
    "however , since this method requires calibrations of the intrinsic distributions of the shapelet coefficients , it has strong dependence on the galaxy morphology .    in this paper , we propose to use the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field to measure the cosmic shear .",
    "this method was first used by seljak and zaldarriaga ( 1999 ) on cmb lensing .",
    "we generalize their analysis by including the psf and carrying out the measurement in fourier space .",
    "this approach is well defined regardless of the galaxy morphology and the form of the psf , and involves simple image processing procedures .",
    "given a high image resolution , the method can potentially probe the cosmic shear from galaxy substructures , greatly suppressing the shape noise .",
    "we begin by introducing the method in  [ method ] . in ",
    "[ test ] , this approach is shown to work well on different types of computer - generated mock galaxy images with general forms of psf .",
    "a brief summary is given in ",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we derive the relation between the cosmic shear and the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field without a psf in  [ withoutpsf ] . in the presence of an isotropic gaussian psf ,",
    "the relation is modified and shown in  [ withisopsf ] . in  [ fourier ] , fourier transformation is introduced not only to simplify the measurement of the spatial derivatives , but also to deal with general forms of psf .      the surface brightness on the image plane @xmath0 and on the source plane @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the position angles on the image and source plane respectively ) are related through a simple relation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the spatial derivatives of the lensing deflection angle , which can be expressed in terms of the convergence @xmath7 and the two shear components @xmath8 and @xmath9 . using eq.[[fifstits ] ]",
    ", we get : @xmath10 where we have implicitly assumed that @xmath11 is small , which is true for weak lensing .",
    "assuming the original surface brightness field @xmath12 is isotropic on the source plane , the quadratic combinations of the derivatives of the lensed image provide a direct measure of the shear components ( @xcite ) : @xmath13 where the averages are taken over the whole galaxy .",
    "the presence of psf brings both advantages and disadvantages . on the positive side ,",
    "the psf smooths out the galaxy surface brightness field , which is originally not differentiable due to structures on arbitrarily small scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the convolution of the galaxy image with the psf leads to a nontrivial modification to eq.[[shear12 ] ] , the form of which is calculated in this section . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the psf is isotropic and gaussian .",
    "general forms of psf will be discussed in ",
    "[ fourier ] .",
    "the observed galaxy surface brightness distribution @xmath14 is related to @xmath15 via : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gaussian psf with scale length @xmath18 : @xmath19 using eq.[[fifstits ] ] to replace @xmath15 with @xmath12 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 in eq.[[fofi ] ] , we get : @xmath20 or equivalently : @xmath21f_s(\\vts)\\\\ \\nonumber & \\doteq&\\vert{\\rm det}(\\mathbf{a})\\vert\\int d^2\\vts f_s(\\vts)w_{\\beta}(\\vt-\\vts)\\\\ \\nonumber & \\times&\\left[1-(\\vt-\\vts)\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{i})\\cdot(\\vt-\\vts)/\\beta^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 unitary matrix . note",
    "that the second part of eq.[[fofs2 ] ] is a result of taylor expansion of the term @xmath24 $ ] due to the small amplitudes of the lensing components @xmath11 . for convenience ,",
    "let us define : @xmath25 which is the surface brightness field we would observe in absence of lensing .",
    "eq.[[fofs2 ] ] can then be re - written as : @xmath26 let @xmath27 , then : @xmath28 using eq.[[fofs3 ] ] and eq.[[fvto ] ] , it is not hard to express the derivatives of @xmath14 in terms of the derivatives of @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 note that we have implicitly assumed that the spatial fluctuation of the cosmic shear is negligible on galactic scales . assuming the distribution of @xmath29 is isotropic , we obtain the following relation between the shear components and the spatial derivatives of the surface brightness field : @xmath32 where @xmath33    the derivation of eq.[[shear12psf ] ] and eq.[[delta ] ] is shown in the appendix .",
    "note that in the limit when the galaxy image is very smooth over the scale length @xmath18 , the correction @xmath34 approaches zero , eq.[[shear12psf ] ] then reduces to eq.[[shear12 ] ] .      for the method to become useful ,",
    "there are at least two remaining issues to be addressed : * 1 . * how to measure the spatial derivatives of the surface brightness field ; * 2 . * how to deal with other forms of the psf .",
    "it turns out that fourier transformation provides a solution to both problems .",
    "since convolutions in real space correspond to multiplications in fourier space , one can easily transform the psf to a desired form ( an isotropic gaussian form in our case ) by multiplying the fourier modes of the observed image with the ratios between the fourier modes of the desired psf and those of the original psf ( known from calibrations with stars ) .",
    "this operation is usually well defined if the scale length of the desired psf is larger than that of the original psf .",
    "moreover , it turns out that for the purpose of measuring the cosmic shear , one does not need to transform the new image back to real space , because the derivatives of the surface brightness field can be more easily measured in fourier space .    as an example",
    ", we show how to measure quantities such as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the surface brightness field of interest .",
    "first of all , the distribution @xmath36 in real space should be sampled with an interval @xmath37 which is a few times less than the size of the psf to avoid translating high frequency power into the frequency range determined by the sampling resolution through discrete fourier transform ( @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the galaxy image should be `` oversampled '' to avoid aliasing power from small scales in the discrete fourier transform . for undersampled images",
    ", one can smooth the images with an additional large enough psf , which can be treated as a part of the psf from the instrumentation , and therefore does not affect our discussion below . similarly , to avoid such aliasing power at low frequency , the box size for the fourier transform should be a few times larger than the image size .",
    "given this setup , the fourier transform of the image is defined as : @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 n is the box size , chosen to be a power of @xmath40 for the fast fourier transform .",
    "it is now straightforward to show that @xmath35 can be expressed as the sum over the fourier modes weighted by the wave numbers : @xmath41 eq.[[fourierfinverse ] ] gives exactly the quantity @xmath35 multiplied by the number of bright pixels covered by the galaxy , because the dark pixels have no contributions .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the other terms in eq.[[shear12psf ] ] in fourier space .",
    "note that for the purpose of obtaining @xmath42 and @xmath43 , it is not necessary to calculate the number of bright pixels because it appears in both the nominator and the denominator in eq.[[shear12psf ] ] .",
    "this section is organized as follows : in  [ diskgalaxy ] , we test the method using mock regular galaxies smeared by different forms of psf ; in  [ irregulargalaxy ] , using mock irregular galaxies generated by 2-d random walks , we further demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on galaxies with a different morphology , and explore the possibility of suppressing the shape noise in the shear measurements by including the information from galaxy substructures .",
    "each regular galaxy in our simulation contains a thin circular disk with an exponential profile and a co - axial de vaucouleurs - type spheroidal component ( @xcite ) .",
    "when viewed face - on , the surface brightness distribution ( before lensing and smearing by the psf ) of the galaxy can be parameterized as : @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the distance to the galaxy center , @xmath46(@xmath47 ) is the scale length of the disk(spheroid ) , and @xmath48 determines the relative importance of the spheroid .",
    "the overall luminosity of the galaxy is only important in the presence of noise , which will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "our simulation box is @xmath49 .",
    "we choose @xmath46 to be @xmath50 of the box size of the simulation , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "note that changing these particular numbers does not affect our main conclusions .",
    "once the galaxy s face - on image is generated , it is projected onto the source plane with a random inclination angle along a random direction perpendicular to the line of sight of the spheroid part is set to one for simplicity . ] .",
    "the projected galaxy image is subsequently distorted by a constant cosmic shear and smeared by the psf in real space .",
    "we consider two psf models given by the following forms rotated by certain angles ( shown in fig.[psfs ] ) : @xmath53\\\\ \\nonumber & & w_r^{(2)}(x , y)\\propto\\exp\\left[-(x^2 + 0.8y^2)/(2r^2)\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the scale length , which is equal to six times the grid size , comparable to the galaxy size . the shear components @xmath54 are chosen to be @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 .    to measure the cosmic shear , we follow the procedures described in  [ fourier ] .",
    "the desired psf has an isotropic gaussian form with a scale length about @xmath63 times that of the original psf .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.[shear_disk ] .",
    "the results are consistent within @xmath64 error regardless of the form of the psf .",
    "our irregular galaxies are generated using 2-d random walks .",
    "the random walk starts from the center of the simulation box for 20000 steps , each of which is equal to the grid size of the simulation box ( which is now @xmath65 ) .",
    "once the distance from the center is more than @xmath66 of the box size , the walk starts from the center again to finish the rest of the steps .",
    "the surface brightness of the galaxy is equal to the density of the trajectories .",
    "note that these galaxies naturally have abundant substructures , which are useful not only for further testing the method , but also for illustrating how much lensing information may be contained in the substructures .",
    "we caution that our random - walk - type galaxies are not based on any physical models , therefore they do not necessarily mimic observed irregular galaxies . in a future paper",
    ", more realistic galaxy models will be adopted to study this topic .    for the purpose of this section , we smooth the galaxies directly with the isotropic gaussian psf of different scale lengths , which correspond to different angular resolutions .",
    "the scale length @xmath18 ( defined in eq.[[wbeta ] ] ) is chosen to be @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath50 of the box size ( roughly corresponding to @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 of the galaxy size ) .",
    "fig.[rwgalaxy ] shows typical images of our irregular galaxy under these four different angular resolutions . for convenience",
    ", we plot the minimum @xmath18 as unity in the figures of this section .",
    "the shear component @xmath43 is set to zero , and @xmath42 is fixed at @xmath74 . after averaging over @xmath75 irregular galaxies , we find that the measured @xmath42 is @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 . more interestingly , as shown in fig.[results ] , the statistical error bar is found to decrease significantly when the angular resolution is increased .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig.[sigma ] , which shows an approximate power - law relation between the measured variance of @xmath42 and @xmath18 , the exponent of which is close to one .",
    "note that as the angular resolution increases , one gets additional information on the cosmic shears from the galaxy substructures .",
    "if we naively assume that each bright pixel on the galaxy map provides an independent measurement of the cosmic shear , we expect the variance of the measured cosmic shear to scale as the inverse of the number of the bright pixels , or @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the hausdorff dimension of the galaxy image ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the hausdorff dimension of our random - walk - generated irregular galaxies is @xmath40 ( @xcite ) , the variance of @xmath42 should scale as @xmath86 , which is not too far from what we have observed in our numerical experiments .",
    "in reality , substructures generated by the 2-d random walks are correlated at some unknown level , therefore , the observed exponent indicated in fig.[sigma ] is less than the hausdorff dimension .",
    "we have presented a simple approach of measuring the weak cosmic shear using the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field .",
    "the measurement should be carried out in fourier space , in which it is easy to evaluate the spatial derivatives and to transform the psf to a desired form .",
    "the accuracy of the method is demonstrated using computer - generated mock regular and irregular galaxies .",
    "we find no systematic errors on the measured shear components in the numerical experiments .    given high image resolutions , this new method may reduce the shape noise in the shear measurement significantly , because it takes into account the shape information on the galaxy substructures . using the mock irregular galaxies generated by 2-d random walks , we have shown that the variance of the measured shear is indeed suppressed by a large factor when the image resolution is increased .",
    "this example encourages us to test this method on real galaxies of a wide range of morphology classes in a future paper by joining the shear testing programme ( @xcite ) , the results of which may be useful for optimizing the signal to noise ratio in shear measurements and planning future weak lensing survey .",
