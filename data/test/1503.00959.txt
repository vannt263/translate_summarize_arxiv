    "in the theoretical study of polymer physics  @xcite , computer simulations provide a powerful method to mimic the behavior of polymers covering the range from atomic to coarse - grained scales depending on the problems one is interested in  @xcite .",
    "the generic scaling properties of single linear and branched polymers in the bulk or confinement under various solvent conditions have been described quite well by simple coarse - grained lattice models ( i.e. , random walks ( rws ) , non - reversible random walks ( nrrws ) , self - avoiding random walks ( saws ) , or interacting self - avoiding random walks ( isaws ) on a regular lattice , regarding the interactions between non - bonded monomers ) .",
    "as an alternative one can use coarse - grained models in the continuum , such as a bead - spring model ( bsm ) ( where all beads interact with a truncated and shifted lennard - jones ( lj ) potential while the bonded interactions are captured by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential ) using monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite . on the one hand , however , as the size and complexity of a system increases , detailed information at the atomic scale may be lost when employing low resolution coarse - graining representations . on the other hand",
    ", the cost of computing time may be too high if the system is described at high resolution .",
    "therefore , more scientific effort has been devoted to developing an appropriate coarse - grained model which can reproduce the global thermodynamic properties and the local mechanical and chemical properties such as the intermolecular forces between polymer chains  @xcite . while these models are already known since a long time",
    ", the present work is the first study presenting precise data on conformational properties of these model , when a bond angle potential is included .    in this paper",
    "we deal with linear polymer chains in dilute solutions under good solvent conditions , and describe them by lattice models on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "although coarse - grained lattice models neglect the chemical detail of a specific polymer chain and only keep chain connectivity ( topology ) and excluded volume , the universal behavior of polymers still remains the same in the thermodynamic limit ( as the chain length @xmath3 )  @xcite , two coarse - grained lattice models , the standard simple cubic lattice model ( sclm ) and the bond fluctuation model ( bfm )  @xcite , are considered for our simulations .",
    "the sclm is often used for the test of new simulation algorithms , and the verification of theoretically predicted scaling laws due to its simplicity and computational efficiency .",
    "the bfm has the advantages that the computational efficiency of lattice models is kept and the behavior of polymers in a continuum space can be described approximately .",
    "the model thus introduces some local conformational flexibility while retaining the computational efficiency of lattice models for implementing excluded volume interactions by enforcing a single occupation of each lattice vertex .",
    "redthe excluded volume effect plays an essential role in any real polymer chain , while in a dilute solution under a theta solvent condition , or in concentrated polymer solutions such as melts , and glasses , the real polymer chain behaves like an ideal chain .",
    "the excluded volume constraint can easily be incorporated in the lattice models by simply forbidding any two effective monomers occupying the same lattice site ( cell ) . tries et al .",
    "have successfully mapped linear polyethylene in the melt onto the bfm and their results are in good agreement with experimental viscosimetric results quantitatively without adjusting any extra parameters  @xcite .",
    "varying the backbone length and side chain length of the bottle - brush polymer based on the bfm , a direct comparison of the structure factors between the experimental data for the synthetic bottle - brush polymer consisting of hydroxyethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) as the backbone polymer and flexible poly(n - butyl acrylate ) ( pnba ) as side chains in a good solvent ( toluene ) and the monte carlo results is given  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lattice models have also been used widely to investigate the conformational properties of protein - folding  @xcite and dna in chromosomes  @xcite in biopolymers . for alkane - like chains",
    "the angles between subsequent effective bonds are not continuously distributed , but only discrete angles are allowed . therefore , the lattice model such as the sclm where only the discrete angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are allowed is an ideal model for studying alkane - like chains of different stiffnesses .",
    "a direct comparison of simulation results between the lattice models and the off - lattice bsm is also possible , e.g. linear polymers  @xcite and ring polymers  @xcite in a melt , adsorption of multi - block and random copolymers  @xcite , semiflexible chains under a good solvent condition  @xcite , the crossover from semiflexible polymer brushes towards semiflexible mushrooms as the grafting density decreases  @xcite .",
    "results from these two coarse - grained models are qualitatively the same .",
    "namely , they both show the same scaling behavior , but the amplitudes and the critical or the crossover points can vary depending on the underlying models .",
    "however , our main motivation was to understand the microscopic differences between the two lattice models , sclm and bfm , for describing the conformations of polymers and to provide this information for the further development of a multi - scale approach for studying polymers of complex topology and polymer solutions at high concentration based on the lattice models .",
    "therefore , we only focus on the two coarse - grained lattice models , sclm and bfm , here . in the mapping between atomistic and coarse - grained models ,",
    "it turns out that a bond angle potential also needs to be included in the coarse - grained models , as is done here .",

    "( a ) ( b )    two models are used for simulating linear polymers in the bulk under good solvent conditions .",
    "one is the standard saw on the simple cubic lattice , effective monomers being described by occupied lattice sites , connected by bonds of fixed length @xmath31 .",
    "each site can be visited only once , and thus the excluded volume interaction is realized .",
    "the other is the standard bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) . on the simple cubic lattice each effective monomer of a saw chain blocks all eight corners of an elementary cube of the lattice from further occupation .",
    "two successive monomers along a chain are connected by a bond vector @xmath32 which is taken from the set \\{@xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 } including also all permutations .",
    "the bond length @xmath26 is therefore in a range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are in total @xmath39 bond vectors and @xmath40 different bond angles between two sequential bonds along a chain serving as candidates for building the conformational structure of polymers .",
    "the partition sum of a saw of @xmath41 steps is @xmath42 which is simply the total number of possible configurations consisting of @xmath43 monomers .    in the literature",
    "there are still no estimates of the fugacity @xmath44 and the entropic exponent @xmath10 for saws on the bfm .",

    "if the excluded volume effect is ignored completely , a polymer chain behaves as an ideal chain .",
    "it is well described by a random walk ( rw ) , a walk that can cross itself or may trace back the same path , or by a non - reversal random walk ( nrrw ) where immediate back tracing is not allowed .",

    "the flory exponent is @xmath60 for an ideal chain and its mean square gyration radius @xmath61 .    for the simulations of single rw , nrrw , and saw chains we use the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm )  @xcite .",
    "it is a biased chain growth algorithm with resampling and population control . in this algorithm",
    "a polymer chain is built like a random walk by adding one monomer at each step with a bias depending on the problem at hand , and each configuration carries its own weight .",
    "the population control at each step is made such that the  bad \" configurations are pruned with a certain probability , and the  good \" configurations are enriched by properly reweighting , until a chain has either grown to the maximum length of steps , @xmath41 , or has been killed due to attrition . a detailed description of the algorithm perm and its applications is given in a review paper  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has the advantage that the partition sum can be estimated very precisely and directly .",
    "it is also very efficient for simulating linear polymer chains up to very long chain lengths in dilute solution at and above the @xmath62-point .",

    "thus , the static structure of a polymer model on the coarse grained level could be tuned , when one introduces bond length and bond angle potentials , to mimic the structure of a chemically realistic model of a polymer which contains covalent chemical bonds , whose orientation is controlled by both bond angle and torsional potentials . in this paper",
    "we did not discuss the details of this mapping procedure yet , but we hope that our work will be a useful input for this problem .",
