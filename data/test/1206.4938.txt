    "there has been a growing number of exoplanets detected around post - main sequence ( ms ) stars . at present , about 50 red giants ( rgs )",
    "are known to host planetary or brown dwarf - mass companions .",
    "recent discoveries also show evidence of multi  planet systems ( cf .",
    "hd 102272 b , c ) or multi - brown dwarf systems ( bd+20 2457 b , c  @xcite ) .",
    "although hot jupiter type planets exist around sub  giants @xcite , the more evolved giants show a paucity of short period and eccentric planets @xcite .",
    "this is most likely the result of tidal disruption and/or planet engulfment during the rg phase ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "even rarer is the number of lithium - rich rg stars . according to the standard evolution theory ,",
    "when a solar  type star leaves the ms and becomes a rg , its lithium abundance should drop from a(li ) @xmath3 to about a 1.5level .",
    "in fact , the observed upper giant branch limit is a(li ) @xmath4 0.5 @xcite and only a few percent of giants have been observed to have a(li ) @xmath5 1.5 ( @xcite and references therein ) , with some exhibiting a(li ) @xmath6 3.3 , the value expected for a protostellar disk rather than an evolved star .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of a planet in a highly eccentric , long - period orbit around a lithium - overabundant giant star .",
    "bd+48 740 is one of the targets of the penn state ",
    "toru planet search ( ptps ) , which is devoted to the detection and characterization of planetary systems around stars more evolved than the sun .",
    "high resolution optical spectra discussed in this paper were collected with the hobby ",
    "eberly telescope ( het ) @xcite . the telescope was equipped with the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite which was fed with a 2 arcsec fiber , working at the r = 60000 resolution . for the basic data reduction ,",
    "standard iraf tasks and scripts were used . the signal",
    "to noise ratio was typically better than @xmath7 per resolution element at 5900  @xmath8 .",
    "for the li abundance analysis only one order of the red spectra containing the @xmath9li 6708@xmath8 line was used .",
    "we have carefully checked all the het / hrs flat ",
    "field spectra for an occasional contamination caused by a nearby feature that , depending on the actual rv of the star , may mimic the li line and influence the abundance calculation .",
    "all such flat - field spectra were excluded from the analysis .",
    "bd+48 740 ( tyc 3304901 ) is a v=8.69 , b - v = 1.252@xmath00.032 , @xmath10 = 1.36@xmath01.13 , k2 giant in perseus .",
    "its basis atmospheric parameters , as well as mass , radius and age were determined by @xcite and are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the stellar rotation velocity was estimated by means of the @xcite method and from the sme spectrum modeling .",
    "the estimated range of values is given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "bd+48 740 was observed by the ptps survey between jan 12 , 2005 and march 5 , 2012 .",
    "precise relative rvs were measured at 15 epochs over 2229 days using the standard i@xmath11 cell calibration technique @xcite .",
    "doppler shifts were derived from least  squares fits of template spectra to stellar spectra with the imprinted i@xmath11 absorption lines .",
    "the measured rvs revealed variations over @xmath6 90 m s@xmath12 . with the estimated amplitude of solar  type oscillations @xcite of @xmath6 8  ms@xmath12 and the average rv uncertainty of 5.6 m",
    "s@xmath12 , the observed rv amplitude was @xmath13 times larger than the expected observational uncertainties .",
    "consequently , we found it justified to assume that the observed rv signal could be due to an orbiting planet .",
    "several absolute rv determinations for bd+48 740 exist in the literature .",
    "three out of five measurements presented in @xcite agree with our determination , while the other two suggest the amplitude of 61  kms@xmath12 .",
    "the reason for such a scatter in the rv values is probably the very strong is na doublet at @xmath14 5890 , 5895 @xmath8 , which probably originates in the local is bubble @xcite , and is separated from the stellar lines by 46 km s@xmath12 .",
    "when observed at a resolution of 37  @xmath8/mm , the blend shows two peaks with a minimum , whose position depends on the actual atmospheric conditions .",
    "@xcite found bd+48 740 to show no rv variations , but they computed a different rv for the star .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear .",
    ".[tab1]basic atmospheric and stellar parameters of bd+48 740 . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to check the reliability of the preliminary orbit , 1000 trials of scrambled radial velocities were performed , which resulted in 112 solutions with @xmath15 lower than the one presented here .",
    "therefore , the corresponding false alert probability for our best ",
    "fit model is fap=11.2@xmath16 .    the resulting post ",
    "fit residuals are consistent with stellar jitter interpreted as under  sampled p  mode oscillations .",
    "no correlation between the observed radial velocity and the line bisector variations exists ( r=0.166 ) and the correlation between radial velocities and line profile curvature ( r=0.488 ) is statistically insignificant .",
    "the fact that the orbital period is much longer than the estimated rotation period , and the high orbital eccentricity make it unlikely that the rv variations are generated by a spot rotating with the star .",
    "we have also searched 3029 wasp photometric measurements of bd+48 740 collected over 1475 days for any periodic variations and found none within uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , 134 epochs of hipparcos photometry of the star reveal its constant brightness of h@xmath17=8.8543 @xmath0 0.0017 mag .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observed rv variations reflect a keplerian motion of the star around the system s barycenter .      the observed spectra were analyzed with the spectroscopy made easy package ( sme , @xcite ) .",
    "sme assumes lte and parallel plane geometry , but it ignores magnetic fields , molecular lines and mass loss . the synthetic spectrum synthesis was based on kurucz s models of stellar atmospheres .    .",
    "the final sme fit to the spectrum of bd+48 740 for the li line is presented in the inset with the dashed line .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as an input , sme requires a set of lines from the vienna atomic line database ( vald , @xcite ) identified in the spectrum , the stellar data ( including rv ) , and the instrumental profile .",
    "the observed spectrum was considered as a model constraint .",
    "although sme requires the m / h ratio , the fe / h was used as an approximation for the metallicity .",
    "the 6695 - 6725  @xmath8 range was modeled , which covers the @xmath18li line at 6708  @xmath8 as well as several lines of al , ti , si and ca ",
    "fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "sme was allowed to fit rv , rotation velocity and macroturbulence velocity as well . to increase the precision , sme fitting",
    "was performed on all 16 spectra obtained with the het , yielding an estimate of the abundance uncertainty ( rms ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the lithium abundances also requires a correction for non  lte effects , especially in the case of the lithium line at 6708 @xmath8 considered here , which is affected by several non - lte processes ( @xcite and references therein ) . with sme lte a(li)=2.24 , and the non  lte correction of 0.087 from @xcite , the final non ",
    "lte value of a(li)=2.33 @xmath0 0.04 ( rms ) was obtained .",
    "this value places bd+48 740 on the short list of lithium overabundant giants .",
    "the effective temperature ( known quite precisely ) allows the placement of bd+48 740 close to the stable helium burning part of the evolutionary track of a 1.5 m@xmath19 , solar metallicity star of @xcite .",
    "although a relatively small spread in the evolutionary tracks in this region of the hr diagram , together with the uncertainty in the luminosity , does not allow an unambiguous determination of bd+48 740 evolutionary status , the location of the star on the hr diagram favors the interpretation in which the star is evolving toward the red giant branch ( rbg ) tip .",
    "however , we can not completely exclude scenarios in which the star is descending from the giant branch toward the horizontal branch ( hb ) or ascending toward the agb .",
    "unfortunately our het / hrs spectra do not allow for the determination of the the @xmath20c/@xmath21c carbon isotopic ratio to constrain the evolutionary status better .",
    "any interpretation of the current state of bd+48 740 past the rgb tip would imply that the star had already gone through the helium flash and extended envelope stage . as a result , the observed planet at 1.9  au would have been disrupted by tidal capture or at least have its orbit circularized @xcite .",
    "given the star s evolutionary status and the orbital distance of the planet , orbital circularization is not expected for another 0.5 gyr .",
    "the observed orbital eccentricity may be overestimated due to the small number of data points available @xcite or it could result from not resolving two components in 2:1 circular or near - circular resonant orbits @xcite . if taken as a true value , the observed eccentricity of bd+48 740 b at 1.89 au , although high , fits into the observed distribution of the rv planets as a function of semi  major axis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this distribution begins to significantly diverge from purely circular orbits beyond 0.04 au , and by 0.1 au it reaches the eccentricity range of 0.0  0.5 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the distribution of eccentricities in multiple planet systems differs from that of single planets @xcite in that it displays lower values .",
    "moreover , when plotted as a function of log ( g ) of the host star , the distribution of orbital eccentricities of planets orbiting giants narrows , showing generally mildly eccentric orbits , typically with e@xmath40.45 with only one exception of hd 1690 ( e=0.64 ) @xcite .",
    "since tidal interaction of the planet with bd+48 740 is still not expected at this point and the observed eccentricity is not unusual among planets orbiting ms stars , we could argue that the planet eccentricity is _ primordial _ , that is , it has not been modified as the star left the ms . however , if we consider the fact that the eccentricity is very high for a giant star companion we then need to find a mechanism operating only during the post  ms evolution of the star that resulted in such eccentricity .",
    "in principle , post  ms evolution can trigger instability in a multiple system that was stable during the stellar ms evolution due to stellar mass - loss @xcite . however , rgb stars are not expected to be losing mass in large quantities and therefore the stability boundary should not move considerably during this phase . moreover , a non ",
    "adiabatic approximation is neither expected to operate at the current planet orbital distance and stellar mass - loss regime @xcite nor to excite the eccentricity of the planet .",
    "it is generally accepted that large eccentricities , at any evolutionary stage , have to be excited ( see e.g. @xcite ) . of the several mechanisms that have been proposed , we find the kozai effect @xcite very unlikely to take place in bd+48 740 b , since no binary companion has been detected with a good degree of confidence .",
    "the nearest object to bd+48 740 is 2mass 02425927 + 4855549 , a j=13.288 mag star which is separated by 12.3 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath66840 au ( assuming the distance to bd+48 740 d=556 @xmath0 129 pc from @xcite ) .",
    "the jhk photometry available for the star suggests however , that the 2mass object is a hot , distant field star .",
    "furthermore , the star is not a member of the nearby @xmath22 and @xmath23 per open cluster , and its proper motion show that it is not a high velocity star , thus making it very unlikely that a stellar encounter would be responsible for exciting the eccentricity @xcite .",
    "we are left then with a planet ",
    "planet scattering event as a plausible mechanism to excite the eccentricity of this evolved system ( see e.g. @xcite ) , either during the ms or during the post ",
    "ms evolution of the star",
    ". a viable scenario could be one in which the the bd+48 740 planetary system contained originally more than one planet . in turn of a planet - planet scattering event",
    ", the innermost ( unobserved ) planet was brought into the stellar surface due to either a direct hit or tidal interaction with the evolving star , while the orbit of the outer planet was excited to the observed , high eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the derived stellar parameters of bd+48 740 imply a stellar radius of r / r@xmath19 = 11.4 @xmath0 0.7 ( or 0.05 au ) . a small number of confirmed exoplanets around ms stars orbit within this orbital distance of their host stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is very likely that these planets , at such small orbital separations , will tidally interact with their host already while on the ms with the end result of the spiral - in of the planet into the stellar envelope ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more substantially , for sun like stars , the number of jovian - type planets in the hot jupiter category , orbiting within 0.1  au , is about 1% @xcite .",
    "it is expected , and indeed confirmed by the occurrence fraction of hot jupiters around sub  giant stars with masses m@xmath24 1.45 m@xmath25 @xcite , that a large majority of these systems , with the exception of a few extreme cases , will survive the ms evolution .",
    "however , after the star leaves the ms , and especially as it ascends the rgb , the tidal influence becomes important and extends far beyond the stellar radius for these almost fully convective stars @xcite .",
    "the bd+48 740 planetary system might have originally resembled hat p-13 b , c @xcite or hd 217107 b , c @xcite .",
    "these are the systems around ms stars , both of which have a close  in planet in a nearly circular orbit ( a hot jupiter ) and another , more distant companion in an eccentric orbit .",
    "a possible dynamical evolution leading to such configuration , involving planet - planet scattering , was presented by @xcite .",
    "the observed enhanced li abundance suggests , however , that in the case of bd+48 740 the planet - planet scattering event operated quite recently , during the post - ms evolution of the star .",
    "it is difficult to identify a mechanism that might have preserved the primordial li - abundance of bd+48 740 given that , as soon as the the star moved past the sub - giant branch , convection should have reduced its li abundance by at least an order of magnitude ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , either bd+48 740 has experienced a li - production in its interior , or , it has suffered external pollution from a companion .",
    "we can rule out the presence of a stellar companion that might have transfered li - rich material onto the surface of bd+48 740 , since the rv measurements do not show any sign of it .",
    "lithium could have been produced in the interior of bd+48 740 , brought up to the stellar surface and survived , if a cameron - fowler mechanism @xcite had been in place in this low mass rgb star .",
    "for that , high mixing rates between the surface and the li - forming regions are required .",
    "it has been shown by several works now that li - rich stars can be found all along the rgb ( see e.g. @xcite ) thus excluding the @xcite process , in which the extra mixing , and therefore the li enrichment , should be associated with the rgb bump , when the molecular weight discontinuity created by the inward penetration of the convective envelope is erased by the advancement of the h - burning shell . even allowing for uncertainties , the location of bd+48 740 on",
    "the hr diagram supports the conclusions of these works .",
    "several other sources for extra mixing have been suggested to explain li ",
    "rich giants , i.e. tidally enforced enhanced extra mixing @xcite , thermohaline @xcite , and magneto - thermohaline mixing @xcite .",
    "in fact , they could be operating all together in bd+48 740 , if we assume a scenario in which a companion has been tidally captured and engulfed into the stellar surface ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it has been recently shown by @xcite and @xcite that the accretion of metal rich planetary material onto the surface of exoplanet host stars can increase the li surface abundance of the target stars on timescales that depend on the mass and stellar structure and have been estimated to be short , of the order of a few myr ( see also @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that engulfment of substellar objects could also trigger li enhancement and a mass - loss enhacement on the rgb .",
    "no trace of ir excess can be found in the 2mass and wise data for bd+48 740 ( j - k vs. k - wise[3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath26 m ] ) .",
    "archive iras observations , upper limits mostly , suggest however , that the star is in the extended shell and relatively high lithium abundance phase of @xcite scenario .",
    "the projected rotation velocity of bd+48 740 is typical for its luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "the actual amount of stellar rotation velocity increase depends strongly on stellar structure ( envelope mass ) and the ( unknown ) rate of planet evaporation . the observed rotation velocity of bd+48 740 neither contradicts nor supports the engulfment scenario .",
    "we present evidence of a high lithium abundance , a(li)=2.33 @xmath0 0.04 , in the rg star bd+48 740 .",
    "this value is well above the expected limit of a(li)=1.5 for evolved stars .",
    "we also present multi - epoch , precise radial velocities for the star which , although sparse , show periodic variations which can be interpreted as a result of the keplerian motion of a planetary mass companion with @xmath27 m@xmath2 , on a highly eccentric orbit of e=0.67 .",
    "we find no evidence of a stellar - mass companion to bd+48 740 .    given the current evolutionary status of the star , its li abundance and the planet s current orbit , we discuss a possibility that bd+48 740 had a second planet in an innermost orbit that could have been engulfed by the star .",
    "this possibility , although not directly verifiable with the available data , allows a scenario in which both the high lithium abundance of the star and the planet s highly eccentric orbit could originate from a recent , violent dynamical event , likely representing a later stage in the evolution of the planetary system , which was similar to hat p-13 while still on the ms .",
