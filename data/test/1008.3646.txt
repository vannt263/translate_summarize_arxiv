    "spectral graph theory examines relationships between the structure of a graph and the eigenvalues ( or spectrum ) of a matrix associated with that graph .",
    "different matrices are able to give different information , but all the common matrices have limitations .",
    "this is because there are graphs which have the same spectrum for a certain matrix but different structure  such graphs are called cospectral with respect to that matrix .",
    "the following are some of the matrices studied in spectral graph theory :    * the adjacency matrix @xmath1 .",
    "this is defined by @xmath2 when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are adjacent and @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "the spectrum of the adjacency matrix can determine the number of edges and if a graph is bipartite , but it can not determine if a graph is connected ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig:1a ] , the `` saltire pair '' @xcite , for an example of two graphs which are cospectral with respect to the adjacency matrix but not any of the other matrices we will discuss . *",
    "the laplacian @xmath6 .",
    "this matrix is also known as the combinatorial laplacian and is found by taking the difference of the diagonal degree matrix @xmath7 and the adjacency matrix .",
    "the spectrum of the laplacian can determine the number of edges and the number of connected components , but it can not determine if a graph is bipartite ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig:1b ] @xcite , for an example of two graphs which are cospectral with respect to the laplacian but not any of the other matrices we will discuss .",
    "* the signless laplacian @xmath8 .",
    "this matrix is found by taking the sum of the diagonal degree matrix @xmath7 and the adjacency matrix .",
    "the spectrum of the signless laplacian can determine the number of edges and the number of connected components which are bipartite , but it can not determine if a graph is bipartite or connected ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig:1c ] @xcite , for an example of two graphs which are cospectral with respect to the signless laplacian but not any of the other matrices we will discuss . * the normalized laplacian @xmath9 .",
    "this matrix is defined by @xmath10 , where by convention if we have an isolated vertex then it will contribute @xmath5 to the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the normalized laplacian is closely related to the spectrum of the probability transition matrix of a random walk .",
    "this spectrum can determine if a graph is bipartite and the number of connected components , but it can not determine the number of edges ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig:1d ] for an example of two graphs which are cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian but not any of the other matrices we will discuss .",
    "one way to understand what structure the spectrum of a matrix can not identify is to study cospectral graphs .",
    "cospectral graphs for the adjacency matrix @xcite and the laplacian matrix @xcite have been studied , particularly for graphs with few vertices .",
    "cospectral graphs for the signless laplacian have been little studied beyond their enumeration and rules which apply to all of these matrices @xcite .",
    "little is also known about cospectral graphs for the normalized laplacian compared to other matrices .",
    "previously , the only cospectral graphs were bipartite ( complete bipartite graphs @xcite and bipartite graphs found by `` unfolding '' a small bipartite graph in two ways @xcite ) or were regular and cospectral for @xmath1 ( since a regular graph is cospectral for all of these four matrices if it is cospectral for any one of them ) .    in table  [ table ] ,",
    "we have listed the number of graphs with a cospectral mate for the normalized laplacian matrix for graphs on nine or fewer vertices , counted using sage ( see appendix  [ sagecode ] for example code ) .",
    "the number of cospectral graphs for the normalized laplacian have also been counted by wilson and zhu @xcite , though they give percentages and not the count of how many have cospectral mates .",
    "we have also included similar counts for the other three matrices which come from @xcite .",
    "@xmath11    given the relatively small number of graphs with a cospectral mate with respect to the normalized laplacian , it is surprising that so little is known about forming cospectral graphs for that matrix .",
    "the problem is that some of the main tools that are used to form cospectral graphs for other matrices do not generalize to the normalized laplacian .",
    "one such example is a technique known as switching , which is accomplished by replacing edges by non - edges and non - edges by edges between two subsets ( see @xcite ; a simple example is shown in figure  [ fig : switch ] ) .",
    "given some basic assumptions , this is an easy way to construct cospectral graphs for the adjacency matrix .",
    "however , switching does not in general work for the normalized laplacian , in particular , it will only be guaranteed to work when the degrees are unchanged ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so the graphs shown in figure  [ fig : switch ] are _ not _ cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian .",
    "in section  [ sec : swap ] we will introduce a method to construct cospectral graphs for the normalized laplacian .",
    "this construction will work similarly to switching in that we will make a small local change to the graph by swapping in one bipartite graph with a cospectral mate and show the two graphs still share the same eigenvalues . in section  [ sec : other ]",
    "we will show that if we add additional constraints to the bipartite graphs which are swapped then the resulting graphs are also cospectral with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in section  [ sec :",
    "applications ] we will show how to use this construction to produce large families of graphs which are mutually cospectral . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : comments ] we will give some concluding remarks .",
    "the method of finding cospectral graphs for the adjacency matrix by switching reduces to making a local change of the graph from one bipartite subgraph to its complement and showing that the spectrum is unchanged .",
    "we will consider something similar , namely a local change , but instead of replacing a bipartite subgraph with its complement we will swap out a bipartite subgraph for a cospectral mate .    for a subset @xmath14 of the vertices @xmath15 of @xmath16 , we will let @xmath17 $ ]",

    "if the dimension of the eigenspace associated with @xmath34 intersected with the subspace of vectors that are nonzero only on @xmath21 is the same for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the graphs @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian , where @xmath35 only differs from @xmath24 in that @xmath37 $ ] is the complete graph and similarly @xmath36 only differs from @xmath32 in that @xmath38 $ ] is the complete graph .",

    "it is well known that the spectrum of a complete bipartite graph @xmath42 is @xmath43},1^{[p+q-2]},2^{[1]}$ ] , where the exponent indicates multiplicity , hence these graphs are easily seen to be cospectral .",

    "* for @xmath88 : we proceed similarly as we did for vertices in @xmath21 and we get @xmath89    next we note by lemma  [ lem : help](c ) that @xmath72 and @xmath74 are orthogonal to each of the vectors @xmath85 for @xmath70 . on @xmath18 ,",
    "the dimension of the space orthogonal to the @xmath85 for @xmath70 restricted to @xmath18 is two . a basis for the orthogonal complement of @xmath90 is @xmath91 ,",
    "so any harmonic vector orthogonal to all of these _ must _ be a linear combination of @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath92 be a harmonic eigenvector of @xmath24 that is orthogonal to all of the @xmath85 for @xmath70 , then @xmath92 restricted to @xmath21 and @xmath22 is orthogonal to the @xmath85 , so we have @xmath93 for some constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in other words , the harmonic eigenvector @xmath92 is constant on the vertices of @xmath21 and constant on the vertices of @xmath22 .",
    "everything that we have done for @xmath24 carries over to @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are cospectral , then the @xmath96 found by generalizing the harmonic eigenvectors of @xmath18 and @xmath19 remain the same .",

    "to finish off the first claim of the theorem , we now only need to observe that _ any _ harmonic eigenvector which is orthogonal to all of the @xmath85 in @xmath24 is also a harmonic eigenvector for @xmath32 for the same eigenvalue . again to see this we only need to consider what happens for each vertex .    * for @xmath97 : then all of the entries of the vertex and its neighbors are the same for both graphs , so trivially holds . * for @xmath84 :",

    "we have @xmath99 of course the @xmath55 terms cancel and we are left with @xmath100 .",
    "so even though the degree of the vertex in @xmath22 might change , it will have no effect on this relationship and so again holds .    in summary",
    ", we were able to find @xmath101 harmonic eigenvectors for @xmath24 and @xmath32 that gave the same set of eigenvalues .",
    "for any other harmonic eigenvector orthogonal to these , the same harmonic eigenvector worked for both graphs and so the remaining set of eigenvalues also agreed .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath24 and @xmath32 are cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian .",
    "we now turn to the second statement of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath79 be the degree of a vertex in @xmath21 in the graph @xmath35 .",
    "so let @xmath69 be a full set of orthogonal harmonic eigenvectors of @xmath18 associated with @xmath78 respectively .",
    "first , we consider the harmonic eigenvectors of the graph @xmath18 in the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath34 . by lemma  [ lem : help](a )",
    "we can assume that the vectors @xmath75 are either of the form @xmath71 or @xmath73 .",
    "let the corresponding harmonic eigenvector of @xmath35 be @xmath102 ,",
    "i.e. , we simply expand @xmath75 to be zero outside of @xmath18 .",
    "then we have two cases .    *",
    "if @xmath103 : in this case , we know there are no problems for the vertices in @xmath1 ( every term in is @xmath5 ) or @xmath22 ( since reduces to what was done in @xmath18 ) . for the vertices in @xmath29 we can use lemma  [ lem : help](c ) to see that both sides of are @xmath5 .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath4 is a vertex in @xmath21 .",
    "then we have @xmath104 in particular , we have that @xmath105 is an eigenvalue , i.e. , that @xmath106 is an eigenvalue , for this harmonic eigenvector . * if @xmath107 : in this case we similarly know there are no problems for vertices in @xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath21 . for vertices in @xmath22 , reduces to what we had in @xmath18 and so we can conclude that this is a harmonic eigenvector for the eigenvalue @xmath108 .    now suppose that @xmath109 is associated with @xmath110 for @xmath18 .",
    "then we now will create two harmonic eigenvectors for @xmath35 , namely @xmath111 these will be associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath112 respectively , for @xmath35 .",
    "some simple computations show that the following relationships hold : @xmath113    ( before we proceed to the next step of showing that these are indeed harmonic eigenvectors and eigenvalues we first make the observation that we are not creating more harmonic eigenvectors than we had before .",
    "this is because in lemma  [ lem : help](b ) we can pair up harmonic eigenvectors and eigenvalues . in particular , we would have generated the same new harmonic eigenvectors and eigenvalues if we had used @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "so really we are taking pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to new pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues . )    to verify that these are harmonic eigenvectors with the specified eigenvalues we need to examine what happens for each vertex @xmath4 in @xmath35 using .",
    "we will step through @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the arguments for @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the same .    * for @xmath82 : then all of the entries of the vertex and its neighbors are all @xmath5 and so trivially holds . * for @xmath83 : all of the neighbors in @xmath1 and @xmath29 are @xmath5 while the sum of the entries in @xmath21 will be @xmath5 by lemma  [ lem : help](c ) , so both sides again are @xmath5 and holds . * for @xmath84",
    ": we note that all of the nonzero elements of @xmath85 adjacent to @xmath4 are in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and further we have that for the harmonic eigenvector @xmath75 for @xmath18 that @xmath120 so we have for @xmath35 that @xmath121 so again holds . * for @xmath88 : we proceed similarly as we did for vertices in @xmath21 and we get @xmath122    the remainder of this case now proceeds as before .",
    "namely , everything that we did for @xmath35 carries over for @xmath36 ( counting multiplicity of eigenvalues ) .",
    "further , any other harmonic eigenvector orthogonal to the ones given must be constant on @xmath21 and @xmath22 and so any other harmonic eigenvector which works for @xmath35 also works for @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that they have the same set of eigenvalues , i.e. , are cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian .",
    "the graphs generated by theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] will generally not give cospectral graphs for other matrices .",
    "so it is instructive to examine the proof and try to understand the point at which the fact that we were using the normalized laplacian as compared to some other matrix came into play .",
    "the key is understanding how remains true even when the degrees of vertices in @xmath22 change  if the degree of a vertex in @xmath22 changes , the @xmath55 term on the right side of will change proportionally to the sum on the left so that the equality still holds .    in the case when the degrees of vertices do not change , for example , when @xmath18 and @xmath19 are both @xmath123-biregular , then the proof generalizes .",
    "recall that a bipartite graph is @xmath123-biregular if the vertices can be partitioned into @xmath20 where all edges go between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the vertices in @xmath21 all have degree @xmath23 , and the vertices in @xmath22 have degree @xmath47 .",

    "further , these are also cospectral for @xmath132 since if @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 since the two graphs have the same degree sequence , the product @xmath135 is the same , so the characteristic polynomials also are the same .    in order to use this theorem , we must find two @xmath123-biregular bipartite graphs which are cospectral and for which the dimensions of the eigenspace of @xmath5 restricted to @xmath21 agree on both graphs .",
    "there is one special case for which this is much easier , namely the theorem does not prohibit the possibility that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the same graph ( so trivially are cospectral so we only are reduced to checking the dimension of the eigenspaces ) .",
    "this is not so trivial as it might sound since we are distinguishing the two parts of the bipartite graph in the proof of the theorem , so that while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the same graph we are attaching them in two different ways and so the resulting graphs might not be isomorphic .    as an example of this",
    "consider the graphs shown in figure  [ fig:2bi ] .",
    "these are both the same graph ( just flipped ) and a simple check shows that the dimension of the eigenspace associated with @xmath5 and restricted to @xmath21 is @xmath136 in both graphs .",
    "therefore theorem  [ thm : biregswitch ] applies , and any two graphs to which these two graphs are attached are cospectral . but note that in @xmath19 there are two vertices in @xmath22 with the same neighbors ( marked ) , but there are no such pairs in @xmath18 .",
    "so the resulting graphs are _ not _ isomorphic as long as @xmath137 .",
    "so for example if we consider the graphs @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath138 and we induce a complete graph on the vertices of @xmath21 , then theorem  [ thm : biregswitch ] shows that the resulting graphs are cospectral , and again since there are two vertices with degree @xmath139 sharing common neighbors in one graph but not the other they are non - isomorphic .",

    "next we note by lemma  [ lem : bihelp](c ) that @xmath72 and @xmath74 are orthogonal to each of the new eigenvectors for @xmath70 .",
    "since the dimension of the space orthogonal to the new eigenvectors restricted to @xmath18 is two , any vector orthogonal to all of these new vectors _ must _ be a linear combination of @xmath72 and @xmath74 when restricted to @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath92 be an eigenvector of @xmath24 that is orthogonal to all of the new eigenvectors , then @xmath92 restricted to @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be of the form @xmath93 for some constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in other words ,",
    "the eigenvector @xmath92 is constant on the vertices of @xmath21 and constant on the vertices of @xmath22 .",
    "everything that we have done for @xmath24 carries over to @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are cospectral , then the newly found @xmath96 are the same for both graphs , and further , every other eigenvector orthogonal to the ones found must be constant on the vertices of @xmath21 and the vertices of @xmath22 .",
    "to finish off the first case of the theorem , we now only need to observe that _ any _ eigenvector which is orthogonal to all of the new eigenvectors in @xmath24 is also an eigenvector for @xmath32 for the same eigenvalue .",
    "this again is done in the exact same way as in theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] and we will skip the computations here .    in summary , we were able to find @xmath101 eigenvectors of @xmath0 for @xmath24 and @xmath32 that gave the same set of eigenvalues .",
    "for any other eigenvector orthogonal to these , the same eigenvector worked for both graphs and so the remaining set of eigenvalues also agreed .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath24 and @xmath32 are cospectral with respect to the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "now we turn to the case when the vertices on @xmath21 induce a complete graph .    using the same notation as in the previous case",
    ", we will extend the eigenvectors of @xmath18 for the adjacency matrix to eigenvectors of @xmath35 for @xmath0 .",
    "we have the following :    * for an eigenvector of the form @xmath148 ( i.e. , only nonzero on the vertices of @xmath21 ) and @xmath124 then @xmath149 is an eigenvector for @xmath0 on @xmath35 associated with the eigenvalue of @xmath158 . * for an eigenvector of the form @xmath151 ( i.e. , only nonzero on the vertices of @xmath22 ) and @xmath124 then @xmath152 is an eigenvector for @xmath0 on @xmath35 associated with the eigenvalue of @xmath153 . * for an eigenvector @xmath61 associated with an eigenvalue @xmath154 , we can construct two new eigenvectors , namely @xmath159 these are associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath0 for @xmath35 @xmath160 respectively .",
    "+ ( note , as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] , that we are not creating too many new eigenvectors and eigenvalues , i.e. , by lemma  [ lem : bihelp](b ) we can pair up the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 and @xmath50 will create the same new eigenvectors and eigenvalues as @xmath157 and @xmath145 . )    the verification that each of these is an eigenvector / eigenvalue pair for @xmath35 reduces to verifying for each vertex , similarly as was done in theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] .",
    "we will skip these routine computations .",
    "the remainder of this case now proceeds as before .",
    "namely , everything that we did for @xmath35 carries over for @xmath36 ( counting multiplicity of eigenvalues ) .",
    "further , any other eigenvector orthogonal to the ones given must be constant on @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so any other eigenvector for @xmath0 which works for @xmath35 also works for @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that they have the same set of eigenvalues , i.e. , are cospectral with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we can use theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] to construct large families of mutually cospectral graphs for the normalized laplacian that need not be bipartite nor have the same degree sequences .",

    "]    we note that for any one of these graphs we can easily recover @xmath16 and identify which attachment was done at @xmath4 and so these graphs are all non - isomorphic .",
    "further , by theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] changing our choice of widget at any single vertex does not change the spectrum and so all of the graphs are cospectral .",

    "further , by theorem  [ thm : biregswitch ] changing our choice of widget at any single vertex does not change the spectrum and so all of the graphs are cospectral .",
    "the method of swapping bipartite subgraphs was discovered by examining all cospectral pairs of graphs on at most eight vertices ( all cospectral pairs on at most seven vertices has previously appeared in tan @xcite ) , which included several simple examples of this type .",
    "the set of all cospectral graphs on at most eight vertices can be easily constructed in sage ( see appendix  [ sagecode ] ) .    by looking at the small cases",
    ", we also discovered some new graphs which are regular , but are cospectral for the normalized laplacian with graphs which are not regular .",
    "we have already seen that the four - cycle and the eight - cycle are members of cospectral pairs ( see figures  [ fig:1d ] and [ fig : other1 ] ) . also , @xmath205 is cospectral with @xmath42 for @xmath206 .",
    "another example of a graph which is regular , but is cospectral with a graph which is not regular , is shown in figure  [ fig : regular ] .",
    "these examples show that the normalized laplacian can not , in general , detect whether a graph is regular .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the number of edges in a graph is not uniquely determined by the spectrum of the normalized laplacian . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible for a graph to be cospectral with one of its subgraphs ; examples of this are shown in figure  [ fig : sub ] .",
    "further examples of graphs which are cospectral with respect to the normalized laplacian but have differing number of edges are shown in figure  [ fig : dif ] ( there is currently no known method to generate cospectral graphs with differing number of edges other than using complete bipartite graphs ) .",
    "this also indicates the difficulty in counting the number of cospectral graphs . while for the adjacency and the combinatorial laplacian",
    ", we could first subdivide the graphs according to the number of edges and work with this coarsening when finding cospectral pairs ( see @xcite ) , this is no longer possible for the normalized laplacian .",
    "it would be interesting to find techniques for constructing cospectral graphs for the normalized laplacian which differ in the number of edges .",
    "similarly , it would be interesting to investigate the cospectral graphs for the signless laplacian and see if there are any constructions unique to forming cospectral graphs for that matrix ( similar to what theorem  [ thm : biswitch ] is for the normalized laplacian ) .",
