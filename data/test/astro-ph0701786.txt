    "the chromosphere is in a highly dynamic state , varying on timescales of minutes or less .",
    "much of the dynamics in the magnetized regions associated with the magnetic network and plage are dominated by short - lived , jet - like features .",
    "a whole range of names has been applied to describe these chromospheric features . at the quiet sun limb , they are traditionally called spicules , where they are observed in  as thin , elongated features that develop speeds of 10 - 30 km  s@xmath1  and reach heights of on average 5 - 9 mm during their lifetimes of 3 to 15 minutes @xcite .",
    "their widths ( 0.2 - 1 mm ) and dynamics have , until recently , been very close to the resolution limits of observations . as a result of this limitation ,",
    "the superposition inherent in limb observations , and the difficulty associated with interpreting h@xmath0 data , the properties of spicules have not been very well constrained , which has led to a multitude of theoretical models ( for a review , see , * ? ? ?",
    "the same issues have plagued a solid identification of a counterpart to spicules on the disk .",
    "observations on the disk in h@xmath0 reveal dark mottles in quiet sun regions .",
    "these dark mottles seem similar to spicules , and usually appear in close association with small flux concentrations ( and bright points ) in the magnetic network that outlines the supergranular cells .",
    "there has been a long - standing discussion on whether spicules and mottles are the same phenomena .",
    "this discussion has focused on the different velocity distributions of mottles and spicules to conclude that mottles are not the disk counterpart of spicules @xcite .",
    "however , several groups have used more recent data to argue for a close relationship between mottles and spicules ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dynamic , jet - like features can also be seen in and around active region plage regions .",
    "these features are shorter ( 1 - 4 mm ) and shorter - lived ( 3 - 6 minutes ) and appear to form a subset of what have traditionally been called active region fibrils .",
    "there are also fibrils that do not show jet - like behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig_context ] ) .",
    "these are apparently low - lying , heavily inclined and more static loop - like structures that connect plage regions with opposite polarity magnetic flux . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will not discuss these low - lying fibrils , but focus on the motions of the shorter dynamic fibrils ( hereafter abbreviated as dfs ) .",
    "only recently have dfs become the focus of detailed study , with several papers studying their dynamics , influence on the transition region and their oscillatory properties @xcite . in the past ,",
    "several authors have reported periodicities and oscillations in spicule observations , usually with dominant periods of order 5 minutes .",
    "such periodicities in radial velocity , half - width and line intensity have been suggested based on older observations at the limb , but their interpretation has been difficult due to the complicated line formation of h@xmath0 , line - of - sight superposition and limited spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have discovered significant oscillatory power in dfs in active regions using high - resolution data from the swedish 1  m solar telescope @xcite .",
    "not all dfs show oscillations or recurrence , but a significant number do .",
    "most of the power in especially more inclined dfs resides in periods between 4 and 6 minutes @xcite .",
    "similar periods have been found by @xcite in mottles in enhanced network or weak plage . @xcite and @xcite developed a new numerical model to explain the cause of these ( quasi)periodic mottles or dfs .",
    "they compared their model to data from the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace * ? ? ? * ) and suggested that inclined magnetic fields allow leakage of normally evanescent photospheric p - modes ( which have dominant periods of 5 minutes ) into the atmosphere where they form shocks that drive dfs . a recent paper by @xcite uses extremely high resolution observations obtained at the sst and significantly more advanced numerical modelling to show that dynamic fibrils are indeed caused by magneto - acoustic shock waves .    in this paper , we directly expand on the work by @xcite .",
    "here we perform a more comprehensive analysis of the properties and motion of dfs using the same extremely high spatial and temporal resolution sst dataset of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we use advanced 2/3d numerical radiative mhd simulations that include the convection zone , photosphere , chromosphere and lower corona to interpret all of the measurements and correlations found in the sst data analysis , many of which have not been described in @xcite . in   [ sec : instrumentation ] we discuss the details of the observations and instrumentation , including a description of a novel , advanced optical setup that allowed a diffraction limited 88 minute long timeseries in  linecenter .",

    "this section also summarizes our observational findings and contains a more detailed description of the new model ( introduced by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that explains our observations .",
    "our results strongly suggest that dfs naturally form as the result of chromospheric shock waves driven by convective flows and ( global ) oscillations in the photosphere as suggested by @xcite .    in   [ section :",
    "qs ] we discuss in more detail how this model and our observations of active region dfs relate to equivalent quiet sun phenomena .",
    "the dynamics of quiet sun mottles have been studied extensively by several groups recently @xcite .",
    "while the lack of high spatial and temporal resolution data has made it difficult to properly interpret the findings , this recent work seems to have resolved a long - standing issue @xcite regarding the paths mottles follow during their ascent and descent . @xcite and @xcite use  data to establish that mottles follow parabolic paths .",
    "in fact , observations by @xcite indicate that spicules at the limb similarly trace parabolic paths .",
    "mottles initially appear in the blue wing of extending in the process to lengths of some 2 to 8 mm @xcite . after reaching maximum extent ,",
    "they fade from the blue wing and appear in the red wing of  to recede generally along the same path . throughout most of their lifetime",
    "they appear as dark , elongated features in  linecenter .",
    "the measurements of the parabolic paths traced by mottles have been difficult to interpret .",
    "the projected decelerations of the top of the mottle are generally observed to be far less than solar gravity .",
    "attempts have been made to interpret such low decelerations as projection effects superposed on ballistic flights .",
    "however , the projection angles necessary are typically not compatible with measured doppler shifts @xcite , ruling out a purely ballistic interpretation .",
    "in addition , a purely ballistic flight would imply large initial velocities that have not been observed @xcite .",
    "these observational findings have been difficult to reconcile with the plethora of models for spicules or mottles @xcite . in   [ section : qs ] we describe the similarities between mottles and dfs in more detail , and discuss the applicability of our model to quiet sun mottles .",

    "the light for the wideband cameras was split off the main beam by a 90/10 beamsplitter in front of the soup filter and split again evenly for the 2 wideband cameras , which were set up as a phase diversity pair with one camera at 12  mm defocus on a 45  m focal length .",

    "the images from all cameras were jointly processed with the momfbd image restoration method , yielding 2 restored images for each restoration ( 1 wide band and 1 ) . since the common field - of - view of the cameras within an momfbd set is separately aligned to sub - pixel accuracy , the restored images have near - perfect alignment .",
    "sets from 12 exposures were used per restoration ( i.e. , 36 images in total ) resulting in a time series with 3  fps . for this study , we selected every third image , giving a time series with a fixed cadence of 1  s between images .",

    "the region which is dominated by dfs appears somewhat brighter in h@xmath0 linecenter than surrounding regions .",

    "this is the case for the vast majority of the dfs that do not suffer from superposition and where the df guideline was chosen with a correct angle , i.e. where the df motion runs along the guideline .",
    "all 257 dfs used in the analysis below meet these conditions .",
    "each individual df is therefore fitted with a parabola and the deceleration , maximum velocity ( on ascent or descent ) , maximum extent and duration were derived . to determine the beginning and end points of the parabola , we use the following method .",
    "the steep parabolic ascent and descent of a typical df ( and the very high cadence of our data ) allows for a robust determination of the beginning and end time of each df .",
    "the intersection ( in the xt-plot ) between the parabolic path and a horizontal line at the beginning time or end time is used to determine the location of the `` root '' of the df at , respectively , the beginning and end of its lifetime .",
    "we then use these points in the `` xt''-plot to fit a parabola to the path followed by the df .",
    "the prevalence of parabolic paths is illustrated in all three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_spicxt ] , where a wide variety of dfs are evident .",
    "the df studied in this case ( top panel ) follows its fitted parabola very well with a constant deceleration given by 216  m  s@xmath14 , about two thirds of solar gravity ( 274  m  s@xmath14 ) , a maximum velocity of 27  km  s@xmath1 , and a maximum extent of some 1800  km . the properties for this df and all others discussed in this paper are measured along the projected path .",

    "it is typical that such wide dfs do not rise and fall as a rigid body but rather show phase and amplitude variations in velocity at various positions away from the axis .",

    "the spatial pattern of maximum velocities is not as clear with a large spread of velocities in both regions .    in principle",
    "some of these differences could be caused by projection effects due to the angle between the df axis and the line of sight vector .",
    "a df that propagates along a direction that is parallel to the direction of the line of sight would not be observed as a moving feature in these  movies . to measure the absolute extent , velocity and deceleration along the path of the df",

    "assuming that dfs propagate along the magnetic field , their direction can be estimated from the potential field extrapolation shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "to estimate the effect of projection , we calculate the angle between the line of sight vector and the direction of the magnetic field at a reference height of @xmath22  km above the photosphere .",

    "not surprisingly , all corrected values are larger than the observed values .",
    "in addition , the corrected values show the same spatial differences between region 1 and 2 as the uncorrected values . to estimate how reliable the potential field extrapolation is , we measured the mismatch between the direction of the df axis and the direction of the magnetic field as projected onto the surface , and found it to be of order 20  30 degrees .",
    "a mismatch of this magnitude can lead to significant errors in calculating the projection angle if the df axis is nearly parallel to the projection of the line of sight vector onto the surface .",
    "this means that the corrected values should be considered with caution , especially since the calculations are also based on various assumptions whose validity is unclear .",
    "the poor resolution of the mdi magnetogram , the possible non - potentiality of the active region , and the uncertainty in the actual df height with respect to the chosen reference height , all could lead to significant errors in the estimated projection angle . for example , the potential field extrapolation clearly fails in the top part of region 1 where nearly horizontal fields are predicted .",
    "such horizontal fields are imcompatible with the visual appearance of  linecenter images . in addition , since horizontal fields at this location are almost parallel to the line of sight vector , they lead to very large and obviously erroneous corrections of the local df parameters .    despite these reservations ,",
    "it is very difficult to conceive of a magnetic topology with an orientation to the line of sight that would remove the regional differences for all derived parameters .",
    "in addition , the regional differences in duration ( which are independent of projection effects ) as well as the correlations found between various parameters in the following subsection , strongly suggest that regional differences are not caused by projection effects .",
    "scatterplots of various df properties reveal intriguing correlations .",
    "the most striking correlation , also presented in @xcite , is that between the deceleration and the maximum velocity of the dfs , in which a linear relationship is evident ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) . the larger the deceleration the df suffers from , the higher the maximum ( initial or final ) velocity it shows .",
    "note that there are , again , significant differences between region 1 and 2 : the dfs in region 2 typically have larger decelerations for a given maximum velocity . a linear fit to the observed relationship between the deceleration and velocity shows that both regions have almost identical slopes .",
    "another interesting correlation is that between the maximum length and the duration of a df ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) .",
    "the longer dfs tend to have longer lifetimes . as expected from the histograms in the upper and middle right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] , the dfs in region 1 gravitate towards the upper right of this scatterplot .",
    "we also find that the maximum velocity and maximum length of dfs is well correlated ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) : dfs with higher maximum velocity tend to be longer . however , there is a difference in the slope in regions 1 and 2 .",
    "a linear fit for region 1 reveals a slope of 87 km per km  s@xmath1 , and 60 km per km  s@xmath1  for region 2 .",
    "dfs in region 1 are longer for the same maximum velocity .",
    "the deceleration of dfs shows a somewhat less clear correlation with the df duration ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) .",
    "the longest - lived dfs typically suffer from the lowest deceleration .",
    "this correlation shows a large spread , and is not quite linear for the total population of dfs .",
    "it seems that each region may have its own linear relationship .",
    "dfs in region 1 show a more steep dependence of duration on deceleration , whereas those in region 2 show a smaller range of durations , for a range of decelerations that is similar in extent to that of region 1 .    based on the correlations described in the above",
    ", one would perhaps also expect a correlation between the deceleration and maximum length , or between the maximum velocity and duration . however , such correlations are not clear from the observations , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_scatterbad ] . the large scatter and different slopes that are evident in the plots that do show correlations may be partially responsible for the lack of clear correlation between deceleration and maximum length or the maximum velocity and duration . however , it is also clear that there are very significant regional differences in fig .",
    "[ fig_scatterbad ] , with each region occupying a different area in the scatterplots , and in some cases showing different slopes .",
    "it seems probable that such regional differences also are responsible for the lack of clear correlations .",
    "when we take the line - of - sight correction into account , none of these correlations , or the lack of correlation , change qualitatively . evidently , the correlation between deceleration and velocity , or that between maximum velocity and length can not change significantly because of projection effects , since both parameters would be corrected by the same factor .",
    "the fact that the other correlations , between duration on the one hand , and either deceleration , length or velocity , do not change qualitatively indicates that projection effects do not dominate our dataset",
    ".    the same arguments also apply to any kind of selection effects that are caused by the fact that dfs with very large line - of - sight velocities could disappear from or be invisible in our relatively narrow ( 128 m )  linecenter bandpass .",
    "since dfs are much wider spectral features ( with widths of order 1000 m , see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the width of the bandpass , this means that only features with line - of - sight velocities of order 20 or more km / s would be invisible or only partially visible in the linecenter timeseries .",
    "while in a few cases we can see some fading of the df during its descent , it is still possible to trace the top of the df to its end point . given these arguments , the passband effect can only change the derived correlations marginally .    note that all of the measurements on which the correlations are based , depend on the identification of a single df rising above the chromospheric background .",
    "the latter can be quite noisy and sometimes less well defined .",
    "filtergrams taken in the wings of h@xmath0 might be helpful for a more exact determination of the root location of each df , but such filtergrams were unavailable in this dataset .",
    "this means that the measured length and maximum velocity could in fact be somewhat higher than reported here .",
    "however , given the rapid rise and fall of dfs , the measured duration is quite insensitive to this effect .",
    "since we are measuring the acceleration by fitting parabolas to the height profile , the acceleration is also insensitive to the position of the chromospheric background .",
    "overall , this implies that the relative uncertainty in determining the roots of dfs are unlikely to qualitatively change the correlations reported here .",
    "the interpretation of these correlations , or the lack thereof , will be discussed at length in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "the regional differences in df durations evident in the middle right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] , with 3 minute lifetimes dominating region 2 and lifetimes around 5 minutes more dominant in region 1 , suggest a role for chromospheric waves or oscillations in the formation mechanism of dfs .",
    "oscillations in the chromosphere are typically not steady harmonic waves , but wave trains of finite duration . for this reason we perform a wavelet analysis of the  data , since it allows for localization in time of periodic signals .",
    "the mother wavelet we use is the complex valued morlet wavelet ( @xmath23 ) which consists of a plane wave modulated by a gaussian , an appropriate shape for wave trains . to estimate the statistical significance of the wavelet power spectra ( 95 % confidence interval ) , we compare them to theoretical spectra for white noise , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "taking into account the cone of influence @xcite , we calculate for each superpixel the number of wavepackets in the  timeseries for which the wavelet power is significant .",
    "this is done for a range of wave periods from 150 to 600 seconds .",
    "a superpixel is defined as the average of 4x4 original 0.063  pixels .",

    "the lower right panel shows which wave period dominates , i.e. , has the most wavepackets , at each location of the field of view . from this figure",
    ", we find that many locations show significant oscillatory power throughout the timeseries .",
    "the dominant period of this power varies across the field of view .",
    "clearly visible are the dominant 3 minute oscillations in the sunspots around x=27  and y=37  and at x=45  and y=15 . in addition , the dense plage region which we have designated as region 2 , shows a preponderance of 3 minute oscillations .",
    "in contrast , region 1 , adjacent to the dense plage region , is dominated by oscillations with long periods around and above 5 minutes . in this region ,",
    "the magnetic field is more inclined than in the dense plage region .",
    "the longer , less dynamic and more horizontal fibrils , such as those in the superpenumbra of both spots , seem to be dominated by oscillations with periods longer than 10 minutes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dominant period in region 2 corresponds exactly to the df duration we observe in region 2 .",
    "apparently , dfs typically live for about 3 minutes in this region , which is also the dominant periodicity of the oscillations .",
    "likewise , region 1 is dominated by 5 minute oscillations , and contains dfs with lifetimes of order 5 minutes .",
    "since the oscillation measurements are based on the same data , it seems clear that some dfs are periodic or recurring .",
    "this was also described by @xcite and suggests a relationship between chromospheric waves and dfs , which will be further explored in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "most dfs follow parabolic paths with a symmetrical ascending and descending phase .",
    "these paths are characterized by a large initial velocity , usually of order 15 - 20 km  s@xmath1  ( middle left panel of fig .  [ fig_hist ] ) , that decreases linearly with time until the df has retreated completely . at the end of its life ,",
    "a df s downward velocity is roughly identical to the initial upward velocity .",
    "the linear decrease with time of the velocity , i.e. , the deceleration , is usually between 120 and 280 m  s@xmath14  ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) .",
    "there is a clear linear relationship between the deceleration and the maximum ( down- or upward ) velocity of the df ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) .",
    "dfs reach maximum lengths of order 1,000 to 2,000 km ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) during their lifetimes of 3 to 8 minutes ( middle right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) .",
    "the duration and maximum length are well correlated ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_scattergood ] ) , which indicates that uncertainty about the line - of - sight correction may not play an important role in the regional differences we find .",
    "we resolve more than half of the dfs we observe .",
    "the average thickness is 240 km ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) , with a range between the diffraction limit ( 120 km ) and 1000 km .",
    "some dfs occur over a wider spatial area , whereas others are very thin and stay thin throughout their lifetime .",
    "many of the wider dfs have variable widths as a function of time .",
    "these give the visual appearance of a wave front with varying phase speeds or amplitude in the direction perpendicular to the df axis .",
    "there is often a brightening above the df , which can be clearly seen in xt-plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bright_ring ] ) .",
    "this brightening might be a sign of increased temperatures at the top of the df .",
    "the thickness of this transition is not resolved and is less than 120 km in more than half of the dfs studied ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) .",
    "dfs have significantly different properties in two regions within our field of view .",
    "region 2 contains dense plage , i.e. , a collection of strong magnetic field concentrations in which the magnetic field is generally more vertical .",
    "region 1 is located at the edge of this dense plage region , where the magnetic field is more inclined , as it connects to relatively nearby opposite polarity plage .",
    "the dfs in the dense plage region are shorter ( @xmath24 km ) , have higher decelerations ( @xmath25 m  s@xmath14 ) , slightly lower velocities ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath1 ) and shorter durations of about 3 minutes ( figs .",
    "[ fig_hist ] and [ fig_regionalmaps ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the dfs in the region where the field is more inclined are longer ( @xmath27 km ) , have lower decelerations ( @xmath28 m  s@xmath14 ) , slightly higher velocities ( @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 ) and longer durations of about 5 minutes ( figs .",
    "[ fig_hist ] and [ fig_regionalmaps ] ) .",
    "in addition , df lifetimes correlate well with the dominant periodicities observed in both regions : 3 minute oscillations dominate  in the dense plage region , whereas 5 minute oscillations dominate in the region with more inclined field ( fig .",
    "[ fig_osc_panels ] ) .",
    "our measurements of dfs and oscillatory power strongly suggest that chromospheric waves drive dfs upward .",
    "these chromospheric waves are generated by convective flows and ( global ) oscillations in the photosphere and convection zone .",
    "the magnetic field concentrations provide a channel for these disturbances to propagate up through the chromosphere . during their path",
    "upwards , they shock and drive chromospheric plasma upwards , forming dfs in the process .",
    "this mechanism was originally suggested in rudimentary form by @xcite .",
    "some models have further studied the effects of the convective part of the photospheric driver on the chromosphere in the so - called rebound - shock model @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite included both the convective driver and global oscillations in varying magnetic topologies to directly describe their ( lower resolution ) observations of dynamic fibrils .",
    "the latter model s predictions agree well with the current findings .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by analysis of advanced numerical simulations ( see @xcite and next subsection ) in which dynamic fibril - like features with properties identical to those in our data occur . from the simulations , it is clear that the observed parabolic paths indicate that dfs are shock driven .",
    "when a shock hits the transition region ( i.e , the top of a df ) , the transition region is catapulted upwards at a velocity that exceeds the sound speed in the chromosphere ( @xmath30 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "shock waves generally have velocity profiles in the form of n- or sawtooth shapes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a plasma parcel passing through a shock wave will first experience a sudden kick in velocity - the shock itself  and thereafter a gradual linear deceleration as the shock recedes . assuming a shock wave with amplitude or shock strength of @xmath31 and linear deceleration @xmath32 @xmath33 it is trivially verified that a plasma parcel passing through the shock will describe a parabolic path ;",
    "integrating gives a parcel position that moves as @xmath34 df formation from chromospheric shocks is compatible with the fact that we do not find any dfs with initial ( maximum ) velocities of less than 10 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "waves with smaller amplitudes will not form shocks and hence dfs .",
    "the observed lower limit to the maximum velocities provides an estimate of the sound speed in the upper chromosphere ( 10 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "its value is compatible with chromospheric temperatures from solar models .",
    "more generally , the observed maximum velocities provide a robust estimate of the mach number of chromospheric shocks .",
    "our observations indicate that shocks with mach numbers of 1 through at least 3.5 are ubiquitous in the magnetized chromosphere , and drive dfs .",
    "analysis of numerical simulations @xcite further shows that several different effects influence the shock formation and evolution so that the observed correlations ( e.g. , between deceleration and velocity ) and regional differences follow naturally .",
    "the oscillatory power spectrum of the photospheric driver is dominated by power at 5 minutes .",
    "the chromosphere acts as a filter to the input from below , filtering out waves with periods that are longer than the local acoustic cutoff period . in general , the acoustic cutoff period depends on the inclination of the magnetic field lines to the vertical @xcite . under conditions of vertical magnetic field ( e.g. , region 2 ) , this means that the chromosphere is dominated by oscillations and waves with periods at the acoustic cutoff of 3 minutes . as a result ,",
    "the dfs formed in the dense plage of region 2 are driven by shocks with periods of 3 minutes and thus have lifetimes of order 3 minutes .",
    "in contrast , the inclined field , such as that found in region 1 , increases the acoustic cutoff period .",
    "this allows the photospheric waves with periods of 5 minutes to leak into the chromosphere , develop into shocks and form dfs with similar lifetimes .",
    "since most of the oscillatory power in the photosphere occurs for periods of 5 minutes , the driver in inclined field regions is generally stronger than in regions with more vertical field .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the fact that , in dense plage regions , the amplitude of convective flows and global oscillations is generally reduced at the photospheric level .",
    "dfs that form along inclined field lines also experience only the component of gravity along the magnetic field , so that decelerations are generally lower in the inclined field region .    the observed correlation between deceleration and maximum velocity",
    "can be understood in terms of shock wave physics and the fact that dfs are driven by single shocks . for a given wave period",
    ", n-shaped shock waves will show a steeper decline with time in velocity for a greater shock strength .",
    "in other words , dfs with higher maximum velocity , i.e. , those that are driven by stronger shocks , will show greater deceleration , for a given df lifetime .",
    "it is the combination of these effects that explains the observed regional differences and correlations .",
    "region 2 contains more vertical field , so that only 3 minute power drives the chromospheric waves and shocks .",
    "given the photospheric power spectrum and the reduced power in dense plage regions , this leads to lower amplitudes , i.e. , lower maximum velocity .",
    "in addition , the short lifetimes and more vertical field lead to higher decelerations , and shorter lengths .",
    "conversely , region 1 contains more inclined field , allowing the full photospheric peak power at 5 minutes to leak into the chromosphere to drive dfs . as a result , the velocity amplitude is greater , and the longer lifetimes and less vertical field lead to lower decelerations and longer lengths .",
    "these findings are confirmed when comparing the observations with recent advanced numerical radiative mhd simulations that include the convection zone , photosphere , chromosphere , transition region and corona @xcite .",

    "is obtained using the method of @xcite based on group mean opacities as modified by @xcite to account for scattering .",
    "for the upper chromosphere , transition region and corona we assume effectively thin radiative losses . for the middle and upper chromosphere we parametrize the optically thick radiative losses in strong lines and continua from hydrogen and",
    "singly ionized calcium by using escape probabilities calculated in 1d with the code of @xcite .",

    "is added to a model of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the resultant model is then allowed to evolve in time until a quasi - steady state is achieved .",
    "this takes on the order of a half hour solar time .",
    "the models are convectively unstable due the radiative losses in the photosphere .",

    "these shocks lift and accelerate the transition region as they propagate into the corona . plotting the motion of the transition region along one such field line as a function of time , e.g. a xt plot , reveals that the position of the transition region describes a parabola ( fig .",

    "[ sim_xt ] also indicates that the simulated dfs have the same range of heights and durations that the observed dfs display .",

    "such simulations will also help to fully explain the range of periods and lifetimes that we observe .      how do these findings relate to quiet sun phenomena such as mottles and spicules at the limb ?",

    "both phenomena appear as highly dynamic , dark features in the wings and core of .",
    "they are associated with magnetic flux concentrations that can be observed as bright points in the blue wing of .",
    "more importantly , like dfs , mottles also follow parabolic paths . in an excellent analysis of the dynamics of inclined mottles ( which they refer to as disk spicules )",
    "@xcite find that :    * mottles seem to be generated several hundred kilometers above the photosphere , * mottles undergo real mass motion of order 10 - 30  km  s@xmath1 , extending up to 2 - 10 mm during their lifetime of 2 - 15 minutes , * most mottles are observed to ascend and descend , * mottles in weak plage , or the interior of network cells are more vertical and shorter than the more inclined quiet sun mottles , * the appearance of mottles is varied , they can be thick , thin , tapered or not , curved or straight , * some mottles show downward motion close to their base during the ascending phase , * the decelerations observed in mottles are too small to be consistent with a purely ballistic flight ( at solar gravity ) and the observed doppler shifts , * the largest doppler signal appears at the beginning of the ascending phase , and at the end of receding phase , * the observed velocity profiles are compatible with impulsive acceleration and constant deceleration afterward .",
    "* the maximum upward velocity is usually identical in amplitude to the maximum downward velocity , * there is a linear relationship between the duration and the maximum length of mottles , * there is a correlation between the average velocity and maximum length , * nearby mottles are often found to be driven by a common disturbance .",
    "these findings agree strikingly well with our observations and modelling of dfs , with only a few discrepancies . the lifetimes and maximum lengths of the mottles",
    "@xcite analyzed are typically longer than those of the dfs we describe .",
    "we believe this is in part a selection effect , as we chose to focus only on highly dynamic and shorter features in our dataset .",
    "we note that our dataset also contains a large number of highly inclined fibrils that are longer lived and less dynamic than the dfs ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_osc_panels ] ) .",
    "in addition , preliminary analysis of high - quality sst data of quiet sun mottles indicates that the most inclined mottles are on average longer , but that many of the mottles actually show lengths ( 1,000 - 5,000 km ) that are similar to those of dfs . until further detailed analysis",
    ", it can however not be excluded that dfs associated with plage are on average somewhat shorter in length and lifetime than quiet sun mottles .",
    "preliminary analysis of our numerical simulations suggests that these differences could be related to large scale differences in magnetic topology .",
    "further work is necessary to establish the exact relationship between mottles and dfs .",
    "however , it should be noted that in addition to these striking similarities with mottles , recent observations of limb spicules @xcite show clear parabolic paths with decelerations and maximum velocities of the same order as those reported for mottles @xcite and those we find for dfs .",
    "older observations of limb spicules have also shown evidence for correlations between velocities and maximum lengths @xcite , and between duration and height @xcite .",

    "such a scenario was proposed by @xcite using sst and trace data .",
    "further detailed analysis of our numerical simulations can help shed light on several unresolved issues , such as the role of reconnection in forming quiet sun jets , or whether the observed height of limb spicules can be explained by the mechanism proposed here .",
    "@xcite suggest that it is possible that limb spicules consist of two populations : jets that are driven by shocks ( as described in this paper ) , and jets caused by reconnection .",

    "these taller jets may be the features that have uv counterparts ( e.g , observed by sumer ) , which @xcite calls `` spicules '' .",
    "the combination of high - resolution chromospheric data and advanced numerical simulations strongly suggests that dfs are formed by upwardly propagating chromospheric oscillations / waves .",
