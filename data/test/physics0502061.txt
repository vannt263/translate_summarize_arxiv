    "the heart of experimentally testing and controlling classical and quantum systems often lies in the introduction of an external periodic driving force @xcite .",
    "the driving probes system specific properties , the knowledge of which allows one , in turn , to understand and to optimally control the system at hand .",
    "in particular , driven systems often exhibit resonance like behavior if the external driving frequency matches the natural frequency of the unperturbed system .",
    "typical nonlinear classical systems are resonant for only a finite interaction time since the driving itself forces the system to gain energy and hence drift out of resonance .",
    "only if the natural frequencies are independent of the energy as for the linear ( harmonic ) oscillator , can the system absorb energy on resonance indefinitely . in the quantum world",
    ", the situation may be different by virtue of the unperturbed system possibly having a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "if this spectrum shows an appropriate scaling in the excitation quantum number , resonant motion can persist forever .",
    "a simple example of such a system is provided by the free rotor , whose energy spectrum scales quadratically in the excitation quantum number ( due to periodic boundary conditions for the motion on the circle ) . kicking the rotor periodically in time with a frequency commensurable with the energy difference of two neighboring levels leads to perfectly resonant driving .",
    "these so called quantum resonances of the well - studied kicked rotor ( kr ) @xcite have been known theoretically for some time @xcite , but the first traces of this example of frequency - matched driving have only recently come to light in experiments with cold atoms @xcite . such experiments @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite have also shown the surprisingly robust nature of these resonances in the presence of noise and perturbations .",
    "experimentally , the quantum resonances of the kr are hard to detect for two principle reasons .",
    "firstly , only a relatively small proportion of atoms are kicked resonantly for the following reason : ideally , the atomic motion is along a line , which introduces an additional parameter , namely the non - integer part of the atomic momentum , i.e. the atom s quasi - momentum . treating the atoms",
    "independently , their motion can be mapped onto the circle owing to the spatial periodicity of the standing wave , which makes the quasi - momentum a constant of the motion .",
    "however , only some values of quasi - momentum allow resonant driving to occur @xcite .",
    "all other values induce a dephasing in the evolution which hinders the resonant kicking of the atoms ( see section [ theory ] for details ) . secondly ,",
    "if an atom is kicked resonantly it moves extremely quickly ; in fact its energy grows quadratically in time ( so - called ballistic propagation ) .",
    "these fast atoms quickly escape any fixed experimental detection window after a sufficiently large number of kicks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report experimental data which shows the behavior of a typical experimental ensemble of cold atoms under resonant driving .",
    "our main observable is the mean energy of the atomic ensemble measured after a fixed number of kicks and scanned over the resonant kicking frequency or period .",
    "we verify a recently derived single - parameter scaling law of the resonant peak seen when scanning the energy vs. the period @xcite .",
    "the scaling law allows us , for the first time , to clearly resolve the resonance peak structure because it reduces the dynamics to a _",
    "stationary _ and experimentally robust signature of the quantum resonant motion .",
    "after a short review of our experimental setup in section [ setup ] and the theoretical treatment of the atom - optics kicked rotor close to quantum resonance in section [ theory ] , we present experimental data for the mean energies around the first two fundamental quantum resonances of the kicked atom . from this data , we extract the afore mentioned scaling law in section [ sthree ] .",
    "the effect of the quasi - momentum ( as a typical quantum variable ) on the motion disappears in the classical limit of the kicked rotor , when the kicking period approaches zero @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the rotor is constantly driven , and a ballistic motion occurs for _ all _ members of the atomic ensemble @xcite . both phenomena , the quantum and the `` classical '' ( for vanishing kicking period ) resonance are related to one another by a purely classical theory developed previously for the quantum resonance peaks @xcite .    in section [ sfour ]",
    "we focus on the first direct comparison of the behavior of the ensemble averaged energies in the case of the `` classical '' and the quantum resonance .",
    "in particular , the sub - fourier scaling of the resonance peaks in the mean energy as a function of the kick number is discussed .",
    "the latter makes both types of resonances studied here a potential source of high - precision measurements of system specific parameters .",
    "our experimental system is a realization of the paradigmatic kicked rotor ( kr ) model @xcite , whose relevance lies in the fact that it shows the basic features of a complex dynamical system , and it may be used to locally ( in energy ) approximate much more complicated systems , such as microwave - driven rydberg atoms @xcite , or an ion in a particle accelerator @xcite .",
    "our experiments utilise a cloud of about @xmath1 cold caesium atoms , provided by a standard six beam magneto  optical trap ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "the typical momentum spread of the atomic sample lies between 4 and 8 two  photon recoils .",
    "the shape of the initial momentum distribution is well approximated by a gaussian with standard deviation @xmath2 , centered at zero momentum @xcite , although significant non  gaussian tails can exist @xcite .",
    "the width is measured in units of two  photon recoils , corresponding to the wavelength of the kicking laser @xmath3 .",
    "the fractional parts in these units of the initial momenta , i.e. the quasi - momentum discussed below , are practically uniformly distributed in the fundamental brillouin zone defined by the periodic kick potential @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lab ] , the atoms interact with a pulsed , far - detuned optical standing wave which is created by retroreflecting the light from a 150mw ( slave ) diode laser which is injection locked to a lower power ( master ) diode laser at a wavelength of @xmath4 .",
    "power fluctuations were minimal during the experiments performed here ( @xmath5 ) although larger drifts occurred over the course of many experimental runs .",
    "accurate pulse timing is achieved using a custom built programmable pulse generator ( ppg ) to gate an acousto ",
    "optic modulator .",
    "the ppg is programmed by a computer running the @xmath6 operating system kernel @xcite which controls the timing of the experimental sequence ( aside from the pulse train itself ) .",
    "experimentally , we approximate @xmath7-kicks by pulses of width @xmath8 which are approximately rectangular in shape . the lowest value of @xmath8 used in our experiments was @xmath9 and the highest was @xmath10 .",
    "for the experiments reported here , the effect of the finite width of the kicking pulses @xcite turns out to be negligible , since fairly small numbers of kicks ( less than @xmath11 ) and low kicking strengths are used . in the case",
    "where the @xmath12 limit is being investigated experimentally , the @xmath7kick assumption is clearly not valid @xcite .",
    "this restricts us to a minimum period @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , in our study of the `` classical '' resonance peaks .    in a typical experimental run ,",
    "the cooled atoms were released from the mot and subjected to up to 16 standing wave pulses , then allowed to expand for an additional free drift time in order to resolve the atomic momenta . after this expansion time , the trapping beam is switched on and the atoms are frozen in space by optical mollases . a ccd image of the resulting fluorescence is recorded and used to infer the momentum distribution of the atoms using standard time of flight techniques @xcite . the mean energy of the atomic ensemble may then be inferred by calculating the second moment of the experimental momentum distribution .    kicking laser powers of up to @xmath15",
    "were employed , and detunings from the @xmath16 transition of cesium of @xmath17 and @xmath18 were used for the classical and quantum resonance scans respectively .",
    "these parameters produced spontaneous emission rates of @xmath19 per kick for the quantum resonance scans , which was low enough to ensure that the structure of the peaks was not affected for the low kick numbers used here .",
    "we now consider the theoretical treatment of the atom - optics kicked rotor near quantum resonance .",
    "the hamiltonian that generates the time evolution of the atomic wave function is ( in dimensionless form ) @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the atomic momentum in units of @xmath22 ( i.e. of two - photon recoils ) , @xmath23 is the atomic position in units of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is time and @xmath26 is an integer which counts the kicks . in our units , the kicking period @xmath27 may also be viewed as a scaled planck constant as defined by the equation @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the recoil energy ( associated with the energy change of a caesium atom of mass @xmath30 after emission of a photon of wavelength @xmath31 nm ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 is the kicking strength of the system and is proportional to the kicking laser intensity .",
    "an atom periodically kicked in space and time is described by a wave packet @xmath33 decomposed into @xmath34-periodic bloch states @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the quasi - momentum ( i.e. the fractional part of momentum @xmath21 ) .",
    "quasi - momentum is conserved in the evolution generated by ( [ eq : ham ] ) , so the different bloch states in ( [ eq : bloch ] ) evolve independently of each other , whereby their momenta can change only by integers by virtue of the kicks . for any given quasi - momentum ,",
    "the dynamics is formally equivalent to that of a rotor ( moving on a circle ) whose one - period floquet operator is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39mod@xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the angular momentum operator . from ( [ eq : onecycle ] ) we can immediately derive the two necessary conditions for quantum resonant motion : if @xmath42 ( @xmath43 integers ) then the atomic motion may show asymptotic quadratic growth in energy so long as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 integer at the same time . under these conditions",
    "the floquet operator ( [ eq : onecycle ] ) is also periodic in momentum space , with the integer period @xmath47 . as in previous experimental studies",
    "@xcite , we focus on the first two fundamental quantum resonances @xmath48 , for which the amplitudes of bloch waves with @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 at momentum states separated by @xmath53 exactly rephase after each kick .",
    "the rephasing condition enforces ballistic propagation of the corresponding states in momentum space , so their energy grows quadratically in time .",
    "the remaining bloch components of the original wave packet ( [ eq : bloch ] ) , with @xmath37 not in the resonant class , exchange energy with the kicking laser in a quasiperiodic manner .",
    "the competition between the resonant and the non - resonant subclasses of bloch states ( between ballistic and quasi - periodic propagation ) leads to _ linear _ growth of the total mean energy , @xmath54 , obtained by incoherently averaging over the the continuous set of quasi - momenta which constitute the atomic ensemble @xcite .",

    "the latter island is populated only by the values of @xmath37 which are close to the resonant ones , whilst the non - resonant quasi - momenta correspond to initial conditions outside the nonlinear resonance island @xcite . moreover , at any time @xmath26 , the ratio between the energy and its value at @xmath72 is a scaling function of the _ single _",

    "[ fig : qr2pi ] and [ fig : qr4pi ] , there is noticeable asymmetry in the resonance peaks .",
    "this degree of asymmetry is not predicted by the standard @xmath0classical theory and its precise cause has not yet been ascertained .",
    "however , the asymmetry most likely stems from one or more systematic experimental effects , including the effect of small amounts of spontaneous emission ( @xmath107 chance per kick for the quantum resonance scans ) and also from the slightly lesser time of flight experienced by atoms for positive as opposed to negative @xmath0 .",
    "asymmetry of the peaks has also been noted in other experiments probing the structure of the quantum resonances @xcite . in any case , this asymmetry does not prevent us from observing the structure of the quantum resonances , but leads to a slightly enhanced scatter of the experimental data points in figs .",

    "in spite of the intrinsically quantum nature of the quantum resonances as an example of perfectly frequency - matched driving , the method reviewed in section [ theory ] allows us to map the quantum dynamics onto a purely classical map given by ( [ eq : epsmap ] ) .",

    "because of the analogy between the maps ( [ eq : epsmap ] ) and ( [ eq : sm ] ) , we expect a scaling law for the mean energy also in the limit @xmath112 . since @xmath113 , all quasi - momentum subclasses contribute now similarly to the energy growth , and the averaged energy is given only by the initial conditions within the principal nonlinear resonance island ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath114 with @xmath115 which depends on the variable @xmath116 ( which , given that @xmath117 for the classical resonance , is the same as the scaling variable given in eq . ( [ eq : xdef ] ) ) and weakly on @xmath32 and @xmath27 , in _ contrast _ to the quantum resonant case studied in section [ theory ] .",

    "this linear increase is induced by the contribution of most quasi - momentum classes which lie _ outside _ the classical resonance island . for @xmath112 , almost all initial conditions ( or quasi - momenta ) lie _ within _ the principal resonance island , which leads to the ballistic growth for the _ averaged _ ensemble energy ( [ eq : bal ] ) .    for finite @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : bal ] ) @xmath126 since @xmath118 saturates to the value @xmath127 for large @xmath87 . within the stated parameter range ,",

    "this phenomenon is a classical effect in a system with a regular phase space , and has been observed in @xcite for the first time .",
    "it is distinct from dynamical localization which is the quantum suppression of momentum diffusion for a chaotic phase space @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the freezing effect corresponds to the cessation of energy absorption from the kicks , similar ( but different in origin ) to that which occurs at dynamical localization .",
    "the freezing may be explained as the averaging over all trajectories which start at momenta close to zero , and move with different frequencies about the principal elliptic fixed point of the map ( [ eq : sm ] ) .    from eq .",
