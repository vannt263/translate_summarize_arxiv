    "dust plays important roles in cosmic star formation and evolution of the galaxies .",
    "the basic ingredients of dust grains are metals produced through past stellar activity , and thus the main reservoir of dust is conventionally thought to be mainly confined in interstellar space within galaxies .",
    "@xcite , however , suggested the existence of dust filling the intracluster space within the coma cluster .",
    "this motivated the investigation of the abundance and spatial distribution of dust in different environments , including the color - excess of background objects due to dust optical - uv reddening @xcite , and the fir dust emission from individual objects @xcite , and from stacking analysis @xcite .",
    "recently , mnard et al . ( 2010a : hereafter msfr ) investigated the distribution of dust around galaxies by measuring the angular correlation between sdss galaxy distribution and distant quasar colors .",
    "they found that the mean @xmath1-@xmath2 reddening profile around sdss galaxies is well approximated by a single power - law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angular separation between foreground galaxies and background quasars .",
    "furthermore they discovered that the above power - law extends even for @xmath5 .",
    "the angular scale corresponds to several mpc at the mean redshift @xmath6 of their sdss galaxy sample .",
    "this is far beyond the typical scale of galactic disks , and even larger than the virial radius of typical galaxy clusters .",
    "msfr appear to interpret their result as an evidence for an extended dust surrounding an individual galaxy beyond a few mpc , which we refer to as _ the circum - galactic dust model _",
    "( cgd model ) .",
    "their interpretation , however , is rather subtle .",
    "the mean reddening profile from their measurement @xmath7 is close to that of the angular correlation function of galaxies .",
    "thus the detected dust reddening may be equally explained by the summation of the dust component associated with the central part of galaxies according to the spatial clustering of those galaxies , which will be referred to as _ the inter - stellar dust model _",
    "( isd model ) .    in practice",
    ", it is difficult to distinguish between the cgd and isd models on the basis of the statistical correlation analysis alone as performed by msfr .",
    "therefore a complementary and independent method to constrain the nature of the dust is needed .",
    "this is exactly what we attempt to propose in this paper .    for that purpose ,",
    "we measure the dust far - infrared ( fir ) emission of the sdss galaxies by image stacking analysis .",
    "similar analysis on the sfd galactic extinction map ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sfd ) has detected the fir emission of sdss galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kys13 ) .",
    "we return to the @xmath0 intensity map by sfd , instead of their extinction map , and perform the stacking analysis of the same galaxy sample used by msfr .",
    "if the detected fir emission originates from the same dust component as the msfr reddening measurement , the emission to absorption ratio puts a constraint on dust temperature , which would in turn offer complementary information to distinguish between the cgd and isd models mentioned above .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the data used in the current analysis are described in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we perform the stacking analysis of the msfr galaxy sample on iras / sfd @xmath0 map .",
    "we show the constraint on the dust temperature from the detected fir emission combined with the msfr reddening measurement .",
    "we present summary and conclusions of the paper , and discuss future outlook in section 4 . throughout the analysis",
    ", we assume the standard @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we select our galaxy sample from the sdss dr7 photometric galaxies with 5 passbands , @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 , @xmath2 , and @xmath14 , in northern galactic cap , which covers @xmath157600 @xmath16 . for details of the photometric data ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we conservatively masked @xmath17 of the total area following the sdss mask definition .",
    "we also removed the objects with bad photometry or fast - moving flag according to the photometry flags , which are suspicious to be correlated with the galactic foreground .",
    "see @xcite for more details of our data selection .    for the current analysis",
    ", we impose the same @xmath2-band magnitude cut , @xmath18 , as the msfr sample for a direct comparison with their results , where the magnitudes of the galaxies are correct for galactic extinction using the sfd map @xcite .",
    "our final sample collects @xmath19 galaxies .    for far - infrared data ,",
    "we use the all - sky diffuse 100@xmath20 map provided by sfd ; they have carefully processed the original iras / issa 100@xmath20 sky map , removing the scan pattern of _ iras _ , correcting calibration errors based on cobe / dirbe data , and subtracting zodiacal dust emission and bright point sources with @xmath21 .",
    "hereafter , we adopt a gaussian with @xmath22 for the point spread function ( psf ) of sfd / iras map , as measured by similar stacking analysis by kys13 .",
    "following the procedures of kys13 , we stack the sfd / iras 100@xmath20 map over @xmath23 squares centered on each sdss galaxy . each image is randomly rotated around the center .",
    "the resulting stacked image shows clear circular signature of dust emission associated with those galaxies ( kys13 ) .",
    "the radial profile of the raw stacked image is shown in figure [ fig : profile]a .",
    "the quoted error bars reflect the _ rms _ in each radial bin ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the radial profile is reasonably well fitted by gaussian corresponding to the psf around the central region , but exhibits an extended tail beyond the psf width , @xmath22 , which corresponds to roughly @xmath25 for the mean redshift @xmath26 of the sdss galaxies .    at sufficiently large @xmath4",
    ", the stacked flux should be dominated by the galactic foreground , which is uncorrelated with the sdss galaxies and expected to be constant . the stacked flux , however , increases beyond @xmath27 .",
    "while we do not completely understand the behavior ( see also discussion in kys13 ) , it may be partly due to the fact that the sdss survey region is designed to be located at the low - extinction region , therefore towards high galactic latitudes .",
    "thus the outskirt of the sdss region is surrounded by low galactic latitudes with relatively higher values of the 100@xmath20 intensity , and the stacked flux centered at the sdss region tends to be systematically larger at larger @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless the profile for @xmath28 matches nicely that expected from angular correlation functions of sdss galaxies ( okabe et al . in preparation ) .",

    "we assume that the galactic foreground , @xmath37 , should be uncorrelated with the sdss galaxies , and thus is assumed to be constant at @xmath28 .",
    "since the psf of sfd / iras map is well approximated by gaussian , @xmath43 is written as @xmath44 where @xmath22 is the gaussian width of psf .    the clustering term @xmath33 is written in terms of @xmath32 and angular two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxy , @xmath45 , as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the differential number count of galaxies ( whether or not detected by sdss ) as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the single term is written as a function of @xmath49 alone , therefore the dependence on other physical quantities is neglected .",
    "we approximate the angular 2pcf is described as a single power - law in this angular scale @xcite ; @xmath50 where the amplitude @xmath51 is a function of @xmath49 , but the index @xmath52 is assumed to be a constant and independent of @xmath49 . in this case , equation ( [ eq : cterm ] ) reduces to @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the confluent hypergeometric function , and @xmath55 we fit the radial profile of the stacked image using equations ( [ eq : model ] ) , ( [ eq : istheta ] ) , and ( [ eq : ictheta ] ) . in doing so , we do not use equation ( [ eq : ic0 ] ) , but treat @xmath56 simply as one of the fitting parameters empirically determined from the observed profile .",
    "consistency of the resulting @xmath56 with equations ( [ eq : wtheta ] ) and ( [ eq : ic0 ] ) independently measured for sdss galaxies is an interesting topic ( kys13 ) , which will be discussed in detail elsewhere ( okabe et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we estimate the statistical errors using the jackknife resampling method by dividing the entire sdss sky area into 400 patches of equal area .",
    "the detected emission profile at small @xmath4 is affected due to the iras psf , and should not be directly compared with the msfr measurement . therefore",
    ", we use the clustering term , which is relevant for @xmath57 , for the dust temperature constraint in the following section .",
    "in fact , the psf effect on the clustering term vanishes at large @xmath4 and equation ( [ eq : ictheta ] ) reduces to the power - law as @xmath58 since we ( implicitly ) assume here that the mean reddening profile of msfr , equation ( [ eq : egimsfr ] ) , is explained in the clustered dust model , the value of @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq : wtheta ] ) should match the msfr result . in order to confirm the validity of the assumption , we first choose @xmath59 , @xmath56 , @xmath37 , and @xmath52 as free parameters , and fit to the observed profile imposing @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting best - fit value , @xmath62 , is consistent with that of msfr , @xmath63 ( the other best - fit values include @xmath64}$ ] , @xmath65}$ ] , and @xmath66}$ ] ) .",

    "the departure from the power - law for @xmath69}$ ] is not a problem because it simply reflects the sensitivity to the subtracted offset @xmath37 .",

    "is shown in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the stacked fir emission profile corresponding to the clustering term for @xmath31 is finally given as @xmath73 at large @xmath4 , which plays a major role in our method proposed in section [ subsec : constraints ] .",
    "we note that while the statistical error of @xmath37 is much larger than the best - fit values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 themselves , it does not affect the detection significance of the dust emission from sdss galaxies .",
    "in fact , the variance of @xmath37 simply comes from that of the galactic dust over the sdss survey area ; the majority of the 400 jackknife subsamples indicates similar signatures of the dust emission , except for the difference of @xmath37 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed stacked profile and the prediction from the summation of individual sdss galaxies indeed agree very well , as mentioned in section 1 .",
    "thus we will proceed further to an independent and complementary analysis in order to constrain the spatial extent of dust in the rest of this section .      while the dust _ extinction _",
    "is determined mainly by its column density , the dust _ emission",
    "_ depends sensitively on its temperature as well . therefore , if the measured extinction and emission comes from the same dust distribution , their ratio serves as a sensitive measure of the dust temperature . in this subsection",
    ", we will explicitly show theoretical expressions for the reddening and emission of dust in a simple model of dust density distribution .",
    "since we are interested in the scales beyond the galactic disk scale , we consider the clustering term alone .",
    "the angular profiles of dust extinction and emission around a galaxy are calculated by integrating the dust surface density @xmath76 of nearby galaxies at @xmath14 separated by the projected distance @xmath77 from the central galaxy , where @xmath78 is the angular diameter distance at @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the 2-dimensional projected dust surface density responsible for the clustering term is given by a single power - law : @xmath79 throughout the current model , we set the power - law index @xmath52 as that of the galaxy angular correlation function , equation ( [ eq : wtheta ] ) , specifically @xmath31 in what follows .",
    "although we neglect the redshift evolution of the correlation length @xmath80 , it is effectively absorbed in @xmath81 as long as @xmath52 is time - independent as assumed here .    under the above assumptions , the angular extinction profile of dust at redshift @xmath14",

    "figure [ fig : td ] indicates that the dust model predictions and the observed region are consistent if @xmath121 for mw dust , and @xmath122 for smc , thus the obtained constraints are almost insensitive to the choice of dust model .",
    "given several approximations adopted in our simple model , the quoted statistical errors may underestimate the real uncertainty of the dust temperature .",
    "nevertheless it is encouraging that the derived dust temperature is in good agreement with that of the typical cold component of the isd @xcite .",
    "while this result is reasonably consistent with the isd model , it is premature to conclude that the observed dust profile is explained by the sum of the dust in the central parts of individual galaxies .",
    "our dust model above is based on a single - temperature component , and the extended dust component around a galaxy may have a substantially lower temperature . in this case , the emission flux is much smaller while the reddening amplitude remains almost the same .",
    "therefore we consider a two - component dust model below . in order to keep the same surface density profile of dust , we assume that the two components , corresponding to isd and cgd , share the identical spatial distribution , but they are allowed to have different temperatures @xmath123 and @xmath124 . while this is still a very simple model , we would like to proceed with it because the low - angular resolution of iras images make it difficult to distingush the density profile less than @xmath22 . in any case the purpose of the current paper is to propose a new method to constrain the dust density and temperature , which will be improved significantly later theoretically and observationally .    in the above spirit , we replace equation ( [ eq : sigma_d ] ) by @xmath125 \\left ( \\frac{r_p}{r_{p,0 } } \\right)^{-\\gamma}.\\ ] ] then the observed fir emission to extinction ratio becomes @xmath126_{\\rm obs}= \\cr & \\hspace*{-0.5 cm }   ~\\frac{f_{\\rm isd } \\langle i_{100\\mum } \\rangle(t_{\\rm isd } )   + ( 1-f_{\\rm isd } ) \\langle i_{100\\mum}\\rangle ( t_{\\rm cgd } ) } { \\langle e_{g - i } \\rangle } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at large @xmath4 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 in the right - hand - side are given by equation ( [ eq : extprof ] ) and ( [ eq : firprof ] ) , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the fraction of the isd mass to the total mass : @xmath129 is independent of redshift .",
    "thus the observed value of @xmath130 provides a constraint on @xmath131 for given values of @xmath123 and @xmath132 .",
    "the preceding analysis corresponds to @xmath133 .",
    "the temperature of the cgd is fairly uncertain because of the unknown heating mechanism of the cgd .",
    "if the heating source of the cgd is dominated by the cosmic uv background , which is lower than the interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood by two orders of magnitude @xcite , we obtain @xmath134 following @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite assume the collisional heating mechanism by hot plasma and the efficient injection of dust grains outside the galactic disk .",
    "in this case , they suggested a possibility that the dust temperature reaches even @xmath135 .",
    "the abundance of such possible high - temparature cgd , however , is severly constrained by the observed data . @xcite fitted the sed of dust - selected galaxies , and found that the majority of them have cool and warm dust components with @xmath136@xmath137k and @xmath138k .",
    "the mass of the cool component is typically 100 times larger than that of the warm component .",
    "while the two components may correspond to the two - temperature phases in isd , the estimated mass ratio can be also interpreted to put a severe constraint on the presence of the hot cgd with @xmath139k .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported that the dust temperature near the edge of m31 disk is @xmath140 .",
    "thus the dust temperature in the outskirt is naturally expected to be much lower .    for those reasons , we adopt @xmath141 in what follows . we also confirm that the result below does not change as long as @xmath124 is lower than @xmath109k .",
    "figure [ fig : fism - td ] shows the constraint on @xmath123 and @xmath131 from the observed value of @xmath142 . due to the strong degeneracy between the two parameters ,",
    "the constraint allows a wide range of the isd mass fraction , even as small as @xmath143 if @xmath144 .",
    "thus the measurement of the mean dust temperature of the central parts of galaxies @xmath123 is crucial in distinguishing the origin of the spatial extension of dust .",
    "indeed , the average temperature of the isd varies depending on the properties of the galaxies , and can be as high as @xmath145 @xcite . in this respect , the current data do not exclude a possibility that a substantial amount of the cgd exists , as suggested by msfr and the subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless further improvements in model predictions and the observations in future would put more stringent constraints on the spatial extent of dust through the measurement of dust temperature as we proposed in this paper .    , and the mass fraction of the isd to the sum of the isd and cgd .",
    "we assume that the cgd temperature as @xmath146 .",
    "red curves and blue shaded region indicate the constraint adopting milky way ( @xmath111 ) and smc dust model @xcite , respectively . ]",
    "the spatial distribution of dust is of fundamental importance in understanding the star formation and metal circulation history in the universe .",
    "it is also crucial in correcting for the magnitude of distant objects due to the resulting reddening / extinction @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have detected the fir dust emission from sdss galaxies via their image stacking analysis .",
    "we found that the amount of dust emission is largely responsible for the observed anomaly in the surface density of sdss galaxies as a function of the sfd extinction @xcite .",
    "our previous analysis implicitly assumed that the dust of each galaxy is locally confined in the galactic disk scale , and that the observed fir emission within the large psf width ( fwhm@xmath147 ) is simply given as a sum of contributions of individual galaxies ( corresponding to the isd model in the present paper ) .",
    "in contrast , the dust around a galaxy may be indeed spatially extended up to @xmath110mpc ( cgd model ) , as claimed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite through the correlation of background object colors against the separation length of foreground galaxies .    in order to distinguish between the isd and cgd models , we propose a new method that constrains the temperature of dust by combining the absorption ( detected through reddening of quasars ) and emission ( detected through the stacking of galaxies ) features .",
    "assuming that the nature of galactic dust is described by those of mw and smc , we find that the observed dust is reasonably explained in terms of isd model if the dust temperature of the central parts of individual galaxies , @xmath123 , is approximately 20k .",
    "the estimated temperature is consistent with that of the galactic dust in the central region , but may be higher than that predicted for cgd , if it is heated by uv background alone . on the other hand , the substantial amount of dust may reside far outside the galactic disks if @xmath123 is much higher than 20k .",
    "given several simplification and approximations that we adopted in the present simple model analysis , the associated error - bars of the derived dust temperature is fairly uncertain .",
    "nevertheless we would like to emphasize that the main purpose of the present paper is to propose a new observational method to diagnose the nature of galactic dust .",
    "therefore we do not discuss the interpretation of the present preliminary result .",
    "our proposed method should be , and indeed can be , improved in many ways ; the two components of dust may have different spatial density profiles in addition to the different temperatures .",
    "the redshift evolution of the temperature and amount of dust may be included in the theoretical models .",
    "in addition , the line - of - sights of our emission and reddening measurements may not be exactly the same .",
    "since quasars behind the heavily extincted line - of - sights may not be identified in the sdss photometric catalogue , the reddening measurement may systematically underestimate the real optical depths while the emission is largely free from the bias .",
    "those improvements of the theoretical models and the effect of the possible selection bias need to be investigated , for instance , with mock simulations , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the observational data and analysis can be also improved in future .",
    "the dust temperature would vary depending on the different properties of galaxies , and the amount of dust emission should depend on the morphology of galaxies . the image stacking analysis with better angular resolutions and in multi - wavelengths would significantly improve the observational data .",
    "indeed current result is significantly limited by the poor angular resolution of _",
    "iras_. in those respects , the higher - angular - resolution and multi - band far - infrared data by _ akari _ @xcite are very promising .",
    "we plan to present elsewhere more detailed and systematic results using the _ akari _ data ( okabe et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we thank brice mnard , bruce t. draine , masato shirasaki , and tetsu kitayama for useful discussions .",

    "<S> if we adopt a single - temperature dust model , the resulting temperature is around 18k , which is consistent with a typical dust temperature for a central part of galaxies . if we assume an additional dust component with much lower temperature , the current data imply the temperature of the galactic dust needs to be higher , 20k to 30k . </S>",
    "<S> since the model of the density and temperature distribution of dust adopted in the current paper is very simple , we can not draw any strong conclusion at this point . </S>",
