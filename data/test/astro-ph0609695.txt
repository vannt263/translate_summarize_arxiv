    "strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of the large scale properties of the universe @xcite .",
    "the well - known physics makes it straightforward to use lensing in cosmological estimates of the dark energy @xcite and the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect depends solely on the mass density of the field , it is also an ideal tool for studies of dark matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was conducted in the radio band , is the largest current statistical sample of lensed compact sources .",
    "however , the class has only 13 lensed radio sources in its well - defined statistical sample .",
    "larger lens samples are critical to using lensed quasars for cosmological and astrophysical tests",
    ".    optical surveys for lensed quasars are both complementary to radio surveys like the class and likely to produce larger lens samples since only one - tenth of quasars are radio - loud @xcite .",
    "our sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search ( sqls ; * ? ? ? * ) is based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) , and its catalog of roughly 100,000 spectroscopically - confirmed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so far , the sqls has succeeded in discovering 14 new lensed quasars @xcite , as well as recovering many previously known lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "indeed , the number of sdss - discovered lensed quasars is already a significant fraction of all known quasar lenses ( @xmath3  ) .",
    "the large number of lenses contained in the sqls and its well - defined selection function means that the lens catalog provided by the sqls will be very useful for statistical studies of strong lensing @xcite .    in this paper , we report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed quasar , sdss j133222.62 + 034739.9 ( hereafter sdss j1332 + 0347 ) .",
    "the quasar was confirmed to be doubly imaged by a low - redshift early - type galaxy , from observations using the subaru 8.2-meter telescope and the university of hawaii 2.2-meter ( uh88 ) telescope .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sdss data for sdss j1332 + 0347 , including its selection , is described in  [ sec : sdss ] .",
    "the follow - up images and spectra are shown in  [ sec : image ] and  [ sec : spec ] , respectively . in  [ sec : model ] we model the lens .",
    "finally we summarize our results in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmological model with the matter density @xmath4 , cosmological constant @xmath5 , and hubble constant @xmath6 .",
    "magnitudes are measured in ab system .",
    "the sdss is a survey to conduct both optical imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "it covers about 10,000 square degrees of the sky approximately centered on the north galactic cap with the dedicated wide - field 2.5-m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa .",
    "the five broad - band photometric data are taken in imaging surveys @xcite and are reduced automatically by the photometric pipeline @xcite . from the magnitudes , colors , and morphologies of each object ,",
    "quasar and galaxy candidates are selected as spectroscopic targets @xcite , and then assigned for spectroscopic observations by the tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 3800 to 9200 with a resolution of @xmath7 . the astrometric accuracy is better than @xmath8",
    "rms @xcite and the photometric zeropoint errors are less than @xmath9 magnitude over the entire survey area @xcite .",
    "most of the data have already become publicly available @xcite .",
    "sdss j1332 + 0347 was selected as a lensed quasar candidate from the sdss quasar sample , using the same selection algorithm as that described in @xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "the morphological parameters of each quasar are used to select lensed quasar candidates .",
    "sdss j1332 + 0347 was also selected by an improved algorithm @xcite whose selection function has been extensively tested , and it is in the well - defined source quasar sample of the sqls for lensed quasar statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss_i ] shows the sdss @xmath10-band image of the field under the seeing of @xmath11 .",
    "the sdss point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes and the quasar redshift are summarized in table [ tab : sdss ] .",
    "the sdss images indicate that the object is more extended than a single star , making it a good lens candidate and a target for higher angular resolution observations .",
    "we obtained a 90 sec @xmath10-band image of sdss j1332 + 0347 with the suprime - cam @xcite on the subaru 8.2-meter telescope at mauna kea in seeing @xmath12 on 2003 may 28 .",
    "the @xmath10-band image was reduced in a standard way for the suprime - cam data using the neko software @xcite and the sdfred package @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux was calibrated using nearby stars in the sdss catalogs .",
    "the small differences between the sdss and suprime - cam @xmath10-band response functions are not important here .",
    "we also acquired a 720 sec @xmath13-band image of this object with the quick near - infrared camera ( quirc ) on the uh88 telescope in @xmath14 seeing on 2005 february 20 .",
    "the @xmath13-band image was reduced in a standard way using iraf , and calibrated using the standard star fs 23 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath13 images are shown in figure [ fig : images ] . taking a closer look at the images , especially the @xmath10-band suprime - cam image , we see two compact sources bracketing an extended elliptical source .",
    "indeed , models of the images using a public software , galfit @xcite , consisting of two point sources and an extended object with a de vaucouleurs profile between them fit the data well .",
    "we used stars in the images as templates for the psf in this procedure .",
    "we also show the observed galaxy after subtracting models for the two point sources , the observed stellar components after subtracting models for the galaxy , and the residuals after subtracting models for the point sources and the galaxy , in the second , third , and bottom panels of figure [ fig : images ] , respectively .",
    "we name the two stellar components a and b , where a is the brighter component that lies closer to the galaxy ( separated by @xmath15026 ) , component g. the separation of the two stellar components derived from the @xmath10-band image is @xmath16 , and our relative astrometry is summarized in table [ tab:1332 ] .",
    "the stellar components have similar colors of @xmath17 and @xmath18  mag for a and b , respectively , while the galaxy g has a redder color of @xmath19  mag .",
    "the photometry of the components is also summarized in table [ tab:1332 ] .",
    "these astrometric and photometric properties are typical of known lensed quasar systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and imply that both components a and b are lensed images of a quasar and component g is the lens galaxy .",
    "we carried out a spectroscopic observation of sdss j1332 + 0347 using the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) installed on the subaru 8.2-meter telescope on 2003 june 20 with an exposure time of 900 sec in @xmath14 seeing . the observation was conducted in 2@xmath202 on - chip binning mode , using a @xmath21-width slit aligned along components a and b , with the grism 300b and the filter l600 .",
    "this configuration provides a spectrum covering 3,900   to 6,000    with a spectral resolution of r@xmath22 , a spectral dispersion of 2.7   pixel@xmath23 and a spatial pixel scale of @xmath24 .",
    "we used iraf to analyze the spectra , extracting two traces corresponding to a blend of image a with the galaxy g and image b , respectively .",
    "the two spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "we clearly see broad emission lines redshifted to @xmath25 . on the red wings of the emission lines",
    ", we also see an absorption doublet at 4686   and 4728  , which we interpret as h and k absorption lines redshifted to @xmath26 .",
    "these strong absorption lines significantly distort the emission lines .",
    "it would be helpful to have a cleaner emission line in order to determine the quasar redshifts more accurately , but , the emission lines are the only strong emission lines in the focas spectra .",
    "we estimated the quasar redshifts using three approaches ; 1 ) using the whole line profiles ( @xmath27 ) , 2 ) using only the line peaks ( @xmath28 ) , and 3 ) using the whole line profiles after masking and then interpolating through the absorption lines ( @xmath29 ) . the results , summarized in table [ tab : caiii ] , confirm that the two quasars have the same redshifts .",
    "we adopt procedure 3 ) for our standard result of @xmath30 as it is likely to be the most reliable .",
    "we also verified that the spectrum a+g has little contamination from quasar b by extracting a spectrum at the same distance from component b as component a+g but in the opposite direction .",
    "the spectrum , shown in figure [ fig : spec1 ] , has no significant emission , and we conclude that the emission line in the spectrum a+g is due to component a. furthermore , in the spectra of both components a+g and b , we can see @xmath312796,2803 doublet absorption lines and a @xmath322600 absorption line by an intervening object at @xmath33 .    the spectral flux ratio between components a+g and b , displayed in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spec1 ] , indicates that combination of a+g is redder than component b. if we scale the spectrum b by the @xmath13-band flux ratio of @xmath34 between components a and b , and subtract it from the spectrum a+g",
    ", then we obtain the residual spectrum shown in figure [ fig : spec2 ] .",
    "while the spectrum is noisy , especially around the emission line and towards the blue wavelength region , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is consistent with a template spectrum of an elliptical galaxy @xcite at the redshift of the absorption feature , @xmath26 .",
    "given the strength of the absorption , we conclude that the seds of components a and b are identical and that component g is an elliptical galaxy at @xmath26 .",
    "we used the _ lensmodel _ package @xcite to fit a mass model to the observations of sdss j1332 + 0347 , assuming that the object is indeed a lensed quasar system .",
    "we assume the standard singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model characterized by eight parameters : the einstein radius @xmath35 , ellipticity @xmath36 , position angle @xmath37 , position of the lensing galaxy , the position and flux of the source quasar .",
    "since the number of observable constraints is also eight ( the positions of a , b , and g , and the fluxes of a and b ) , the number of degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "as expected , we were able to find a model that perfectly reproduces the observables , @xmath38 .",
    "the results of the model are presented in table  [ table : model ] .",
    "we note that the best - fit values for the ellipticity and the position angle , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are in good agreement with those observed for the galaxy g ( derived using galfit in @xmath10-band image ; see figure [ fig : images ] ) , of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "einstein radii @xmath35 are related to the velocity dispersions of lensing galaxies , so we can use the faber and jackson relation @xcite to estimate the luminosity of the lens galaxy . from the best - fit value @xmath43 , we estimate that the apparent magnitude of the lens is @xmath44 , assuming the correlation of velocity dispersions and magnitudes of early - type galaxies derived by @xcite .",
    "this is again in good agreement with the observed magnitude of the galaxy g , @xmath45 ( table [ tab : massmodel ] ) , implying that galaxy g is responsible for the most of the lens potential .",
    "we have presented the extensive follow - up observations of sdss j1332 + 0347 using the subaru telescope and uh88 telescope .",
    "we found a bright galaxy ( component g ) between two stellar components ( components a and b ) with similar color in both the subaru / suprime - cam @xmath10-band and uh88/quirc @xmath13-band images .",
    "although the emission lines of the two stellar components are distorted by the h and k absorption lines from the bright galaxy at @xmath2 , we can still confirm that the two quasars are at the same redshift , @xmath1 .",
    "subtraction of a scaled spectrum of component b from the component a+g leaves a residual that is consistent with the spectrum of an elliptical galaxy redshifted to @xmath26 .",
    "the observed luminosity , ellipticity and position angle of the bright galaxy are in good agreement with those expected from a standard lens model .",
    "all these results lead us to the conclusion that sdss j1332 + 0347 is indeed a lensed quasar system , where a source quasar at @xmath1 is lensed by a bright lens galaxy at @xmath2 resulting in an image separation of @xmath46",
    ". one peculiar characteristic of the lens is that the brighter component a is closer to the lens galaxy than the fainter component b. we have no difficulty reproducing the flux ratio , and note that such _ inverted _ flux ratios were also observed and easily modeled in the two - image lens he11041805 @xcite .",
    "this discovery adds another object to the complete sample of the sdss lensed quasars that can be used to estimate the cosmological model .",
    "the brightness of the lens galaxy also makes it a good candidate for dynamical observations ; higher - resolution imaging would allow us to determine more accurately the brightness of the components in this lens system , and spectroscopic observations with better signal - to - noise ratios would also allow us to study the interstellar medium in the lens galaxy in detail .",
