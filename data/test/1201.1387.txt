    "manipulating quantum systems allows one to accomplish tasks far beyond the reach of classical devices .",
    "quantum information is paradigmatic in this sense : quantum computers will substantially outperform classical machines for several problems  @xcite . though significant progress has been made recently , severe difficulties still remain ,",
    "amongst which decoherence is certainly the most important .",
    "large systems consisting of many qubits must be prepared in fragile quantum states , which are rapidly destroyed by their unavoidable coupling to the environment .",
    "measurement - based feedback and coherent feedback are possible routes towards the preparation , protection and stabilization of such states . for coherent feedback strategy ,",
    "the controller is also a quantum system coupled to the original one ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to measurement - based feedback where the controller and the control input are classical objects  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are directly inspired by a recent experiment  @xcite demonstrating that such a quantum feedback scheme achieves the on - demand preparation and stabilization of non - classical states of a microwave field .",
    "following  @xcite and relying on continuous - time lyapunov techniques exploited in  @xcite , an initial measurement - based feedback was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this feedback scheme stabilizes photon - number states ( fock states ) of a microwave field ( see e.g. @xcite for a physical description of such cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) systems ) .",
    "the controller consists of a quantum filter that estimates the state of the field from discrete - time measurements performed by probe atoms , and secondly a stabilizing state - feedback that relies on lyapunov techniques .",
    "the discrete - time behavior is crucial for a possible real - time implementation of such controllers .",
    "closed - loop simulations reported in  @xcite have been confirmed by the stability analysis performed in  @xcite . in the experimental implementation",
    "@xcite , the state - feedback has been improved by considering a strict lyapunov function : this ensures better convergence properties by avoiding the passage by high photon numbers during the transient regime .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present , for a class of discrete - time quantum systems , the mathematical methods underlying such improved lyapunov design .",
    "our main result is given in theorem  [ thm : obscontrollermeas ] where closed - loop convergence is proved in presence of delays and measurement imperfections .",
    "the state - feedback scheme may be applied to generic discrete - time finite - dimensional quantum systems using _ controlled _ measurements in order to deterministically prepare and stabilize the system at some pre - specified target state .",
    "the dynamics of these systems may be expressed in terms of a ( classical ) nonlinear controlled markov chain , whose state space consists of the set of density matrices on some hilbert space .",
    "the jumps in this markov chain are induced by quantum measurements and the associated jump probabilities are state - dependent .",
    "these systems are subject to a discrete - time sequence of positive operator valued measurements ( povms @xcite ) and we use these povms to stabilize the system at the target state . by controlled measurements ,",
    "we mean that at each time - step the chosen povm is not fixed but is a function of some classical control signal @xmath0 , similar to  @xcite .",
    "however , we assume that when the control @xmath0 is zero , the chosen povm performs a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite for some orthonormal basis that includes the target state . the feedback - law is based on a lyapunov function that is a linear combination of a set of martingales corresponding to the open - loop qnd measurements .",
    "this lyapunov function determines a `` distance '' between the target state and the current state .",
    "the parameters of this lyapunov function are given by inverting metzler matrices characterizing the impact of the control input on the kraus operators defining the markov processes and povms .",
    "the ( graph theoretic ) properties of the metzler matrices are used to construct families of open - loop supermartingales that become strict supermartingales in closed - loop .",
    "this fact provides directly the convergence to the target state without using the invariance principle .",
    "a common problem that occurs in quantum feedback control is that of delays between the measurement process and the control process  @xcite . in this paper we demonstrate , using a predictive quantum filter , that the proposed scheme works even in the presence of delays .",
    "convergence analysis is done for perfect and imperfect measurements . for imperfect measurements ,",
    "the dynamics of the system are governed by a nonlinear markov chain given in  @xcite .    in both the perfect and imperfect measurement situations we prove a robustness property of the feedback algorithm : the convergence of the closed - loop system",
    "is ensured even when the feedback law is based on the state of a quantum filter that is not initialized correctly .",
    "this robustness property , is similar in spirit to the separation principle proven in  @xcite .",
    "we use the fact that the state space is a convex set and the target state , being a pure state , is an extreme point of this convex state space and therefore can not be expressed as a convex combination of any other states .",
    "one then uses the linearity of the conditional expectation to prove the robustness property .",
    "our result is only valid for target quantum states that are pure states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : openloop ] , we describe the finite dimensional markov model together with the main modeling assumptions in the case of perfect measurements and study the open - loop behavior ( theorem  [ thm : first ] ) which can be seen as a non - deterministic protocol for preparing a finite number of isolated and orthogonal quantum states . in section  [ sec : closedloop ] , we present the main ideas underlying the construction of these control - lyapunov functions @xmath1 : a metzler matrix attached to the second derivative of the measurement operators and a technical lemma assuming this metzler matrix is irreducible .",
    "finally , theorem  [ thm : main ] describes the stabilizing state feedback derived from @xmath1 .",
    "the same analysis is done for the case of imperfect measurements in section  [ sec : imperfect ] . for the state estimations used in the feedback scheme we propose a brief discussion on the quantum filters and prove a rather general robustness property for perfect measurements in section  [ sec : closedloop ] with theorem  [ thm : obscontroller ] and for imperfect ones in section  [ sec : imperfect ] with theorem  [ thm : obscontrollermeas ] .",
