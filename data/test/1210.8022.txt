    "generation and characterization of multiphoton entangled states represent one of the prerogatives of modern quantum optics experiments .",
    "highly - entangled multiphoton states such as noon states @xcite and photon - number - correlated twin - beam states @xcite are promising resources for practical applications in quantum lithography @xcite , quantum metrology , @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "measurement of the degree of quantum correlations accurately is an essential task for characterizing states of these types .",
    "the recent emergence of photon - number - resolving detectors ( pnrds ) @xcite , such as visible - light photon counters ( vlpcs ) @xcite , transition - edge sensors ( tess ) @xcite , time - multiplexed detectors ( tmds ) @xcite and multipixel photon counters ( mppcs ) @xcite , makes the direct characterization of multiphoton states by photocounting possible .",
    "a measurement using a @xmath0-photon - resolving detector can be modeled by a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) with @xmath1 outcomes : @xmath2 , satisfying completeness , @xmath3 , and positivity , @xmath4 , @xmath5 . the outcomes of the povm are diagonal in the fock - state basis and hence phase insensitive .",
    "the probability of detecting @xmath6 photons is @xmath7 , where the statistical operator @xmath8 describes the photon state , and knowledge of the @xmath9s enables us to reconstruct the photon statistics . for a perfect detector with no loss ( unit quantum efficiency ) and",
    "no saturation , @xmath10 .",
    "then the probabilities @xmath9 should reflect the true frequency of occurrence of @xmath6 photons received , @xmath11 , in the limit of a large number of detection trials .",
    "however , because of loss and noise in the detector the measurement is a proper povm rather than a von neumann measurement and the measured probability @xmath9 is a mixture of the actual photon statistics , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the conditional probability of detecting @xmath6 photons when @xmath14 photons impinged on the detector .",
    "the conditional probabilities model the measurement process in the detector ; in the povm picture , they are related to the outcomes by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ket of the fock state with @xmath14 photons .",
    "the set of @xmath13 has been used to quantify the capability of photon number discrimination of the pnrd @xcite , and the objective of detector tomography is to determine the conditional probabilities @xmath13 in a model - free way @xcite . however , detector tomography relies on the ability to prepare a tomographically complete set of states and complicated optimization techniques .",
    "therefore , parameter estimation for instrument calibration requires suitable models for the povm @xcite .",
    "highly entangled states can be produced in various nonlinear optical processes @xcite . at high intensities ,",
    "the photodetector response becomes nonlinear due to saturation .",
    "for example , in a silicon multi - pixel photodetector consisting of a spatial array of avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) , saturation of individual apds in the silicon multi - pixel detector results in the saturation of the array .",
    "tes is another alternative for pnrd , which exploits bolometric methods for photon detection .",
    "tess operate at cryogenic temperatures ( below 100mk ) and have high quantum efficiency ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "their saturation at high intensities is due to the heating of the detectors beyond the superconducting state .",
    "hence , there is a clear need to understand the effects of saturation so that one can use these pnrds in experiments with intense non - classical states of light .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the feasibility of using lossy pnrds for measuring quantum correlations under joint photodetection in the presence of saturation .",
    "the figure of merit that we use here is the variance of difference of photocounts ( vdp ) , which has been shown to be a good measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the vdp on quantum efficiencies of photodetectors has been exploited in the method of absolute calibration of quantum efficiency using twin - beam light @xcite .",
    "the effects of saturation on this calibration protocol will be discussed here too .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the joint detection setup is described .",
    "the povm modeling of losses and saturation are presented .",
    "the first and second moments of the photocounts of these povm for a state with poissonian statistics are derived . in section 3 ,",
    "the vdp and its moment operators are described .",
    "the vdp of two pairs of two - mode states , one with classical and another with quantum correlations , are calculated .",
    "the difference of these vdp , @xmath18 , is introduced as a measure of distinguishability between quantum and classical correlations .",
    "a tractable analytic form is derived for @xmath18 . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce the noise reduction factor ( nrf ) , a normalized form of the vdp , and show how an absolute calibration of two detectors can be performed using the nrf in the linear regime of the detector response .",
    "the analytic form of the photocount calculated in section 2 gives a quantitative estimate for the range of mean photon numbers in which the detector remains linear .",
    "in section 5 , the results are summarized and the use and limitations of the measurement model are discussed .",
    "the joint measurement scheme is as follows : two modes of radiation with the mode creation operators , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are incident on two pnrds .",
    "the resulting photocounts of the respective pnrds are analyzed .",
    "the joint detection of quantum correlations with lossy photodetectors has been looked into in @xcite .",
    "here we extend the theory to include the effects of saturation .",
    "for the purpose of the analysis , we use the twin - beam ( twb ) state defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fock state with @xmath23 photons in mode @xmath14 and @xmath24 is the probability amplitude of the state @xmath25 .",
    "it follows from the structure of eqn .",
    "( [ twb ] ) that the two modes of the twb state are perfectly correlated in photon numbers .",
    "the twb state can be generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) in a nonlinear crystal pumped by a pulsed laser .",
    "the two beams created by spdc comprise inherently of multiple frequency modes . in the limit of a large number of these modes , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mean number of photons in either the signal or the idler mode @xcite . as a standard for comparison with classical states",
    ", we shall use the two - mode coherent ( tmc ) state @xmath28 where @xmath29 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that there is no phase difference between the two modes in the tmc state because photocounting is a phase - insensitive measurement .",
    "the @xmath30th outcome of the povm of a lossy detector with quantum efficiency @xmath31 is given by @xcite , @xmath32 with @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 was introduced in eqn .",

    "we will also show in the next section , how we can use the features of saturation in the analytic model in the absolute calibration of the pnrds .",
    "sometimes it is helpful to consider a related measure of quantum correlation the noise reduction factor ( nrf ) , @xmath84 for the tmc state , @xmath85 with any value of quantum efficiencies for the detectors . for the twb , @xmath86 with detectors of perfect quantum efficiencies and @xmath87 with lossy detectors , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are their respective quantum efficiencies .",
    "this makes the nrf a useful measure of quantum correlations for two - mode states , as well as a calibration measure for the quantum efficiencies of detectors @xcite .",
    "first , we will describe the current experimental procedure for absolute calibration which is possible in the linear regime of a pnrd . then using the analytic form for the photocount",

    "second , we will suggest the use of the analytic form in eqn .",
    "( [ vodcoh])-([vodtwb ] ) for absolute calibration beyond the linear regime of the pnrd .    for the first method ,",
    "let us consider the scenario in which we are given two detectors with unknown quantum efficiencies and saturation characteristics .",
    "absolute calibration , for example , can be achieved if we have a twb state by measuring @xmath90 in the linear regime of the detectors .",
    "the calibration routine is as follows :    1 .   measure the photocounts , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , of the two detectors with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "this can be done by increasing the pump power of the laser . from this data ,",
    "the mean photocounts , vdp , and consequently the nrf , can be calculated .",
    "2 .   [ k]let us define the ratio of the two quantum efficiencies , @xmath93 . in the regime where the photocounts are approximately linear with respect to @xmath27 , then , @xmath94 .",
    "so @xmath95 can be found by calculating the ratios of the two photocounts .",
    "3 .   for this range of average photon number , @xmath96 . using the measured nrf and the value of @xmath95 found in step [ k ] above , @xmath88 can be calculated .",
    "last , we can calculate @xmath89 from the values of @xmath95 and @xmath88 found .",
    "thus , absolute calibration of the detector is possible in the linear regime of the detector .",
    "this is quantified by the range of @xmath27 in which the term linear in @xmath27 is much larger than the next order term in eqn .",
    "( [ sat_curve ] ) , @xmath97 the higher the saturation point is , the broader the linear regime of the detector .",
    "although it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how small the value on the left - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ regime ] ) must be , current experiments suggest that values of @xmath98 are sufficient @xcite .",
    "the worst range of values of @xmath27 for the linear regime is given for @xmath39 , where we would require that @xmath99 .",
    "for an apd where @xmath39 , the quantum efficiency is typically of order @xmath100 @xcite , thus the linear regime is where @xmath101 .",
    "however , for a vlpc with a typical saturation value of @xmath102 and quantum efficiency @xmath103 @xcite , we have @xmath104 . so the linear regime of the vlpc is about 9 times that of the apd .",
    "this puts a quantitative estimate for the linear regime of a pnrd from its characteristics which are typical for that type of detector and can be taken from its manual .",
    "once an approximate linear regime is determined , a careful calibration can be done in this range of average photon numbers .    in principle , using the analytic forms in eqs .",
    "( [ sat_curve ] ) , ( [ vodcoh ] ) and ( [ vodtwb ] ) , we can achieve absolute calibration beyond the linear regime of the pnrd with just a tmc state using the following protocol :    1 .",
    "split a pulsed laser beam with a 50 - 50 non - polarizing beamsplitter into two parts with equal intensities to form a tmc state .",
    "one has to make sure that the laser produces a coherent state which is free of any additional classical noise , see @xcite .",
    "2 .   measure the photocounts of the beam in each arm with a detector where the detection intervals are triggered by the laser . then increase @xmath27 by increasing the pump power until there is no visible change in the mean photocount with increasing @xmath27 . in this limit ,",
    "the detectors are saturated and we have @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 $ ] , where the subscript  sat \" indicates values at saturation and @xmath107 $ ] denotes the closest integer .",
    "3 .   calculate the difference of photocounts for each detection interval and then the variance of this difference for each @xmath27 value .",
    "using the found values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 we can generate an equation for the nrf of the tmc state as measured by the pnrd from eqs .",
    "( [ sat_curves ] ) , ( [ vodcoh ] ) and ( [ vodtwb ] )",
    ". a nonlinear fit of the experimental data of the vdp for the tmc state can then be done with the analytic form for the @xmath90 using a suitable numerical algorithm .",
    "this will yield fitted values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 thus completing the calibration of the pnrds .",
    "this absolute calibration procedure with the tmc state is possible owing to the features of the vdp in the presence of saturation .",
    "it would not be possible if detectors operating in the linear regime or detectors with just losses are used , because in those cases , the vdp would be insensitive to the quantum efficiencies of the detectors .",
    "the advantage of using this second method instead of the first is that we do not have to rely on a twb state which are harder to generate than a tmc state .",
    "the disadvantage is that we have to use a numerical nonlinear fit method for the calibration which might yield more than one reasonable fit and the errors in these fittings are generally larger than those for a linear regression fit required for the first method .",
    "a model of joint photodetection with lossy detectors considering saturation is presented . using this model ,",
    "we have derived an analytic form for the vdp which is tractable for calculations .",
    "we then used this analytic form to study the effects of saturation on measurements of the vdp .",
    "it has been found that saturation diminishes this measure and the variance of photocounts of the tmc and twb states can not be distinguished at large mean photon numbers .",
    "loss in the pnrds degrades the quality of the measurement of the quantum correlation . on the other hand",
    ", loss can offset the effects of saturation at high average photon numbers .",
    "nonetheless , the vdp is still a good measure of quantum correlations as long as we are not far from the optimal @xmath18 .",
    "saturation also limits the range of @xmath27 in which data is useful for calibration .",
    "this has been known for some time experimentally , but here we have derived quantitatively what this range is in terms of relative values of quantum efficiency and saturation value . with the analytic forms for the measured photocounts and vdp , we will also be able to do an absolute calibration with a tmc state .",
    "the generation of a tmc state is far simpler than that of a twb state where the latter is required for absolute calibration .",
    "as the focus of this paper is on loss and saturation effects in pnrds , we have not looked at possible extensions of the measurement model .",
    "for example , apart from loss and saturation , pnrds can also suffer from dark counts and crosstalk effects , both of which add spurious counts to the data . in using the measurement model for accounting for noise in actual experiments , one would have to take these effects into account .",
    "this can be done by modifying eqn .",
    "( [ lossy ] ) with the appropriate conditional probability matrices representing different noise types .",
    "another useful extension of the measurement model is that of a variable saturation value , @xmath0 . here , we have considered a fixed saturation value but in practice , a pnrd can have different saturation values at different intensities or wavelengths of incident light .",
    "a more robust measurement model can be obtained by taking this variability into account .",
