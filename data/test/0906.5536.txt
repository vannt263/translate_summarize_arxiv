    "this paper is about the equilibrium statistical mechanics of infinite ( bulk ) media , conductors and dielectrics , fully coupled to the radiated electromagnetic ( em ) field .",
    "the crucial problem of statistical analysis of such models is to determine how fluctuations of various statistical quantities , like charge and current densities , scalar and vector potentials , electric and magnetic fields , etc .",
    ", around their mean values are correlated in space and time .",
    "a special attention is devoted to the behavior of correlation functions at asymptotically large distances and to the so - called sum rules , which fix the values of certain moments of the correlation functions .",
    "the studied models are composed of spinless charged particles which are quantum , but non - relativistic ( i.e. , they obey the schrdinger equation and not the dirac particle - antiparticle formalism ) ; according to the correspondence principle , a quantum system admits the classical description in the high - temperature limit . on the other hand , the interaction of charged particles via the radiated em field can be considered either non - relativistic ( non - retarded ) or relativistic ( retarded ) . in the non - retarded regime , the speed of light @xmath0 is taken to be infinitely large , @xmath1 , ignoring in this way magnetic forces acting on the particles ; in other words , charges interact pairwisely only via instantaneous coulomb potentials . in the retarded regime , @xmath0 is assumed finite and the particles are fully coupled to both electric and magnetic ( transverse ) parts of the radiated field .",
    "the ultimate aim is to describe quantum particles in the retarded regime , but due to serious technical difficulties one usually starts with the simpler non - retarded regime .",
    "two complementary approaches exist in the theoretical study of charged systems .",
    "the microscopic one is based on the explicit solution of models defined by their microscopic hamiltonians .",
    "the macroscopic one is based on the assumption of validity of macroscopic electrodynamics .",
    "microscopic description is complicated and laborious , but if some explicit results are available their value is considerable and , e.g. , they can reveal a restricted applicability of macroscopic methods .",
    "microscopic approaches are usually restricted to the non - retarded regime .",
    "a particular interest was devoted in the past to classical and quantum models of conductors .",
    "classical particles interacting by the instantaneous coulomb potential have been treated in the pioneering work by debye and hckel @xcite .",
    "an exponential shielding of the coulomb potential , typical for the classical regime , was observed .",
    "one of the first classical analyses of a system of charged particles fully coupled to the radiation , based on the linearized vlasov equation and maxwell s equations , was performed by felderhof @xcite , see also the monograph @xcite .",
    "the existence of general sum rules for certain moments of the classical charge density correlation functions was established by stillinger and lovett @xcite .",
    "the quantum sum rules , static and time - dependent , were the subject of numerous studies @xcite .",
    "a treatment of quantum coulomb fluids , based on the use of the feynman - kac path integral representation of the thermal gibbs weight @xcite , indicates that the charge - charge density correlation functions exhibit a long - range @xmath2 decay ( see review @xcite ) . a microscopic analysis of conductor systems when transverse em interactions are added to the coulomb ones ,",
    "was done recently @xcite ; a conceptual problem related to the use of classical radiation was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "microscopic models of dielectrics are less developed ; we mention a fluid model of quantized polarizable particles @xcite with the static dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "macroscopic phenomenological approaches usually allow us to predict , with less effort , basic features of relatively complicated complex physical systems in the retarded regime .",
    "a macroscopic theory of equilibrium thermal fluctuations of the em field in conductors and dielectrics was proposed by rytov @xcite , see also the landau and lifshitz course of theoretical physics @xcite and the book @xcite . for bulk systems ,",
    "an interesting phenomenon occurs in two - point correlation functions of microscopic quantities like the induced electric potential or field : the presence of transverse interactions beyond coulomb cancel out some ( spatially nonintegrable ) long - ranged terms observed in the non - retarded regime @xcite .",
    "main applications of rytov s theory were related to inhomogeneous situations . in the famous lifshitz paper @xcite , rytov s theory was used in the context of the casimir attraction between parallel dielectric plates .",
    "another application appeared in the field of thermally excited surface em waves @xcite .",
    "recently , the theory was used in the study of retardation effects on the long - range surface charge density correlation function between two distinct media @xcite .",
    "macroscopic approaches , being essentially of mean - field type , are expected to provide reliable results for the leading terms in the asymptotic long - wavelength behavior of correlations .",
    "those results can be recast as sum rules for moments of correlations integrated in real space , or as asymptotic large - distance behaviors . as concerns these asymptotic behaviors , macroscopic mean - field teories fail when fluctuations become crucial .",
    "the failure of mean - field predictions is well illustrated by the existence of @xmath2 tails in static charge - charge correlations of quantum coulomb systems , as explained in @xcite ; see also the exact calculation of the tail for hydrogen plasma at low densities @xcite .",
    "another implicit assumption for the validity of macroscopic approaches is that correlations decay sufficiently fast .",
    "it is then legitimate to perform local averages for em fields slowly varying in space , which reflects itself in the introduction of the frequency dependent dielectric function @xmath3 in maxwell s equations .",
    "the present paper concerns sum rules for the bulk charge and current density correlation functions in quantum media , conductors and dielectrics , fully coupled to the radiation .",
    "although this subject ( in the non - retarded version ) was in the center of interest of microscopic theories in the past , it remained practically unheeded by macroscopic approaches . here , a sequence of static or time - dependent sum rules , known or new ,",
    "is obtained by rytov s fluctuational electrodynamics .",
    "a technique is developed to extract the classical and purely quantum - mechanical parts of these sum rules .",
    "the sum rules are critically tested on a jellium model of conductors .",
    "a comparison is made with microscopic approaches to systems of particles interacting through coulomb forces only ; in contrast to these microscopic approaches , the current - current density correlation function is found to be integrable in space , in both classical and quantum regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we review briefly rytov s theory of em field fluctuations and present basic expressions for the charge and current densities .",
    "the sum rules for the charge - charge , charge - current and current - current density correlation functions are derived and discussed in sects . 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "6 deals with problematic points of both the rytov fluctuational theory and microscopic approaches .",
    "7 is devoted to an interesting comparison of the present results to those of felderhof @xcite , in the classical limit .",
    "8 is the conclusion .",
    "we consider the @xmath4-dimensional space , defined by euclidean vectors @xmath5 and time @xmath6 .",
    "the two - point functions considered in this paper will be translationally invariant in both euclidean space and time , so we can use the spectral ( fourier ) representation @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the frequency and @xmath9 the wave vector .",
    "the physical system of interest is a medium ( conductor or dielectric ) and an em field present in it , which are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the medium is composed of moving charged particles which are assumed to be non - relativistic . in the long - wavelength scale",
    "much larger than the mean interparticle distance , the macroscopic characteristic of the medium is the frequency dependent dielectric function @xmath3 .",
    "we shall assume that the matter has no magnetic structure , i.e. it is not magnetoactive , and permeability @xmath10 .",
    "the medium is coupled to the em field generated by the particles .",
    "the _ classical _ em field is described by the scalar potential @xmath11 and the vector potential @xmath12 with component @xmath13 @xmath14 . in the considered weyl gauge @xmath15 ,",
    "the microscopic electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath16 with @xmath0 being the velocity of light and @xmath17 being the unit antisymmetric pseudotensor .",
    "the elementary excitations of the _ quantized _ em field are described by the photon operators of the vector potential components @xmath18 which are self - conjugate bose operators .",
    "the retarded photon green function tensor @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 here , @xmath21 denotes the vector - potential operator in the heisenberg picture and the angular brackets represent the equilibrium averaging at temperature @xmath22 . for non - magnetoactive media",
    ", the green function tensor possesses the symmetry @xmath23    the em fields are random variables which fluctuate around their mean values governed by maxwell s equations . to describe fluctuations of the em fields , rytov @xcite studied the effect of a _ weak _ classical current @xmath24 due to the random particle motion in the medium .",
    "this current acts as an `` external force '' on the vector - potential operator in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath25 the mean values of the components of the vector - potential operator can be thus expressed in terms of the green function ( [ 2.4 ] ) by using kubo s linear response in current , @xmath26 the mean value @xmath27 satisfies macroscopic maxwell s equations due to the classical current @xmath28 .",
    "this fact automatically implies a set of differential equations of dyadic type fulfilled by the green function tensor .",

    "it follows from the definition ( [ 2.1 ] ) that the fourier transform of the symmetrized correlation function of statistical quantities @xmath43 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is then determined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 given by ( [ 2.10 ] ) .    in this paper",

    "the fact that there is only one term of the order @xmath68 in the fourier representation ( [ 3.1 ] ) is related to the applicability of the fluctuational theory in the long - wavelength limit @xmath69 ( characteristic length is usually the mean interparticle distance ) ; an exact formula for @xmath70 , valid for any value of @xmath71 , would contain also higher powers of @xmath68 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of ( [ 3.1 ] ) leads to the zeroth - moment ( neutrality ) condition @xmath72 and the second - moment condition @xmath73 these sum rules do not depend on @xmath0 and so they are the same in both nonretarded and retarded regimes .",

    "the expression ( [ 6.5 ] ) works well in the static @xmath181 classical @xmath182 regime , where it reproduces the exact formula ( [ 6.4 ] ) .",
    "as soon as the time difference @xmath183 or the regime is quantum @xmath184 , the two `` dangerous '' terms of type @xmath155 do not cancel with one another in ( [ 6.5 ] ) . since @xmath185 the current - current density correlation function has a nonintegrable algebraic decay @xmath186 at large distances .",
    "the discrepancy between our ( retarded ) and microscopic ( non - retarded ) results for the current - current density correlations is probably analogous to that for the induced electric potential and field correlation functions @xcite .",
    "our analysis does not exclude an algebraic long - range behavior of the current - current density correlation function , but this decay must be fast enough to ensure the spatial integrability of the correlation function .",
    "the classical limit of the current - current density correlation function for the jellium was investigated longtime ago by felderhof , in the nonretarded regime @xcite as well as for the retarded plasma fully coupled to the classical radiation @xcite .",
    "changing the notation @xmath187 and using the substitution @xmath188 , his final formula ( 13.5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite can be rewritten after some straightforward algebra as follows @xmath189 ^ 2}{z_1 q^2/(m\\omega)^2 } \\right\\ } + \\frac{q_k q_l}{q^2 } { \\rm im}\\frac{1}{z_0 } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath190 and @xmath191\\ ] ] with @xmath192 ; the function @xmath193 and the parameter @xmath194 are defined by @xmath195    in the limit @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) , @xmath193 becomes one of the standard definitions of the @xmath198-function .",
    "consequently , @xmath199 where @xmath3 is the dielectric function of the jellium ( [ 3.16 ] ) . inserting these expressions into ( [ 7.1 ] ) and comparing the resulting formula with the classical version ( @xmath200 ) of the current - current density correlation function ( [ 5.1 ] ) ,",
    "we see the equivalence of the two approaches in the considered limit @xmath196 . however , when @xmath71 is finite , the approaches give different results .",
    "felderhof s classical formula turns out to be correct for an arbitrary value of @xmath71 since it leads to the exact relation ( [ 5.8 ] ) or its equivalent ( [ 6.4 ] ) @xcite . from the discussion in sect .",
    "6 we know that this is no longer true for the classical version of our formula ( [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "this fact might be a motivation for searching new improvements of rytov s fluctuational theory which reproduce classical results for any value of @xmath201 and simultaneously describe adequately correlation functions in the quantum regime .",
    "in this paper , by using rytov s fluctuational theory we have derived a series of known or new sum rules for the bulk correlation functions of charge and current densities in conductor and dielectric media , fully coupled to the radiation field ( retarded regime ) .",
    "few important facts are worth to mention .    in the fourier @xmath71 space",
    ", we can anticipate the validity of rytov s macroscopic approach only in the leading @xmath71 order . in this order",
    ", the @xmath71-dependence of the dielectric function @xmath178 can be ignored without any approximation .    in the case of the static @xmath74 sum rules ,",
    "an analysis in the complex frequency upper half - plane was used to split these sum rules onto their classical and purely quantum - mechanical parts .",
    "the classical part coincides , for both conductors and dielectrics , with the results obtained previously by other methods .",
    "the quantum - mechanical part was checked on the jellium model of conductor .",
    "as concerns the time - dependent sum rules , their validity was tested on the jellium , too .",
    "the retarded results for the charge - charge and charge - current density correlation functions coincide with the non - retarded ones obtained previously by microscopic approaches to the jellium model .",
    "the general formulas are applicable to any media , but no other than jellium microscopic results are available to make a comparison .",
    "the most interesting quantity is the current - current density correlation function . within microscopic theories in the non - retarded regime ,",
    "this correlation function turns out to be spatially integrable in the classical limit , but it becomes nonintegrable in the quantum case due to an algebraic decay @xmath186 at large distances .",
    "this contradicts our retarded prediction ( [ 5.2 ] ) about a finite value of the integral over the space , in both classical and quantum cases .",
