    "energy transfer mechanisms in molecules exposed to short intense laser pulses is of great current interest @xcite .",
    "processes such as multiple photoionization , multiphoton dissociation and high - order harmonic generation have been studied for a wide - range of molecular species and an excellent up - to - date review of the field has been provided by posthumus @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen molecule and molecular ion represent ideal systems for a detailed understanding of ionization and dissociation dynamics of small molecules @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of molecule means that it is the system of choice for theoretical studies . in general the mechanisms of dissociation @xcite and ionization @xcite",
    "are very well characterised for this molecule .",
    "nonetheless , the solution of three - body disintegration , incorporating spatial and temporal variations in the laser pulse as well as the thermal ensemble of molecular states , remains a severe challenge for simulation .",
    "consequently , progress has been fairly limited in dissociative ionization spectrum calculations .",
    "although there exists a wealth of data on the photofragment energy spectrum for the neutral molecule , h@xmath4 , and its deuterated forms @xcite .",
    "the data for the much simpler isolated molecular ion is extremely scarce .",
    "the feasibility of experimental studies is hampered by the difficulty in preparing the molecular ion .",
    "in fact experiments on h@xmath5 in intense laser fields has only become possible in the last 4 years @xcite due to refinements in ion sources and charged molecular beam spectroscopy .",
    "typically a small portion of the molecules , at a temperature of a few hundred kelvin and hence predominantly in the vibrational state @xmath6 , can be converted into the bound molecular ion by electron - impact ionization , @xmath7 the molecular ions can be extracted , cooled and collimated into a beam that can be injected to the focus of the laser .",
    "the photodissociation and/or photoionization processes , @xmath8 produce ions and electrons that can be collected and analysed . owing to the small nuclear mass , the expansion ( vibration ) is very rapid - on the scale of 10 fs or less .",
    "consequently the molecule relaxes extremely rapidly on the timescale of the pulse rise time . the design of infrared pulses that would , among other things , allow the resolution of timescale of a fraction of a femtosecond .",
    "the main aim of this paper is a direct comparison of theory and experiment for the proton energy spectrum produced by a short intense infrared pulse interacting with h@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "fragment - ion coincidence measurements that isolate the dissociation and dissociative ionization processes and make the comparison of theory and experiment feasible and realistic .",
    "the molecular dissociation dynamics are modelled using a two - state approximation and takes account of the laser pulse profile .",
    "although this approach neglects the ionization channels , the results for dissociation energies are in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "the characteristic vibrational and rotational time of the h@xmath5 molecule are @xmath9 fs and @xmath10 fs , respectively . for a pulse duration 60 fs or less ,",
    "the laser interaction is sudden on the rotational timescale .",
    "thus one can assume a random statistical orientation of the molecular axis , and that the nuclei recoil along the axial direction .",
    "we assume that the bound ion is created by vertical transitions from the @xmath11 state of the neutral @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters of this potential surface are , bond length @xmath13a.u . with vibrational constants , @xmath14ev and @xmath15 .",

    "the ions and atoms are collected in coincidence such that dissociation and dissociative ionization can be discriminated .",
    "however , depending on the method of measurement , the atomic fragments can arise from the entire focal volume of the laser .",
    "so a valid theoretical comparison must firstly establish the single molecule energy spectra , and then sum these spectra with the appropriate focal volume weighting for the experiment .",

    "the electronic coordinate , with respect to the origin at the internuclear midpoint , is denoted by @xmath29 and the internuclear coordinate is written as @xmath30 .",
    "the two lowest electronic states , namely the ground state @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are sufficient for the study of pure dissociation dynamics .",
    "the corresponding adiabatic energies are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the two - state approximation is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the time - dependent nuclear wavefunctions . in restricting the electronic spectrum to the two lowest levels",
    ", the calculations will inevitably be gauge dependence . for low frequency fields ( much less than the energy level gap )",
    "it is essential to use the length gauge for the laser - molecule interaction .",

    "writing the electric field as @xmath41 , the coupling potential is denoted by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 . within the axial - recoil approximation , @xmath44 ,",
    "is the angle of ejection of the ion(atom ) with respect to the polarization vector .",

    "it is highly anisotropic .",
    "however at the higher intensities , @xmath46 w @xmath3 , the dissociation process begins to saturate and , as we will show , the angular distribution is broader .",

    "the diagonal potentials are : @xmath72 with the off - diagonal coupling : @xmath73 we integrate the differential equations using the 18th order arnoldi propagator as described by peng et al @xcite .",
    "as is well known @xcite , for @xmath74 , the moment @xmath75 , and the coupling is divergent in the molecular basis .",
    "this is simply a manifestation of the molecular basis and the use of the length gauge .",
    "it is necessary and convenient to transform to the asymptotic decoupled atomic eigenstates for the energy spectrum .",
    "these asymptotic states then evolve adiabatically at large distances and long times .",
    "however these states in turn are unbounded in configuration space . as shown by keller @xcite , it is possible to project the diffuse adiabatic asymptotic states onto a compact momentum space .",
    "more importantly , this methods produces the energy spectrum of the atoms that can be compared with experiment .    following @xcite we divide the entire range of @xmath30 into two regions ; an internal region(_in _ ) , where the molecular forces are significant , and an asymptotic region ( _ as _ ) where they are not .",
    "the short - range polarization potential means that the interaction region can be comparatively small ( of the order 20 a.u . ) .",
    "then the wavefunction can be partitioned as follows : @xmath76 where : @xmath77 with @xmath78\\right)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is dividing point and @xmath80 is a parameter which determines the smoothness of the partition . in the asymptotic region hamiltonian",
    "is diagonalised by transforming to the atom+ion states @xmath81 : @xmath82 these states evolve into superpositions ( sums over momentum ) of the asymptotic states : @xmath83 ^ 2\\right ]   \\label{scatt}\\ ] ] where the ion quiver momentum is @xmath84 a symmetric or zero - area pulse is such that : @xmath85 .",
    "the key step in obtaining an energy spectrum is the projection of the numerical wavefunction onto the the continuum of asymptotic states ( [ scatt ] ) .",
    "it is efficient to do this by discretizing the @xmath86-space and performing a finite fourier transform @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with such an approach is that the momentum shift @xmath87 is a continuous function and inevitably leads to a mismatch of the @xmath86-grid . in the present calculations , we use the quadrature rule for the dvr to calculate the fourier transform directly .",
    "we define the shifted fourier transform : @xmath88 } \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times&\\left\\ { \\exp\\left [ -i r_{max } \\left ( ( k\\mp\\delta_0(t , t^{\\prime } ) ) -   \\frac{2\\pi   x_m}{nh}\\right)\\right ] \\right .   \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\left . \\exp\\left",

    "this process is repeated and continued for some time after the end of the pulse .",
    "this allows the dissociating wavepacket still within the interaction region time to reach the asymptotic zone , and for the low energy components to be captured .",
    "typically we extend the integration time to @xmath89 for this purpose .",
    "the @xmath86-space probability density is then given by @xcite : @xmath90 this choice of normalization gives : @xmath91 is the total probability for dissociation .",
    "the dissociation energy is shared equally by the fragments so that the proton energy is given by @xmath92 .",
    "the energy spectral density can then be calculated from the equation : @xmath93",
    "for h@xmath96 with @xmath95 nm and pulse duration @xmath97fs .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the anticipated energy of the two - photon , three - photon and four - photon absorption from @xmath98.,width=510 ]    firstly we consider photodissociation directly from @xmath98 of h@xmath5 .",
    "there are several very accurate proton spectra calculation for @xmath98 dissociation by @xmath99 nm pulses for @xmath100 w @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we checked our calculations with these results and found excellent agreement in all cases . now consider long - wavelength dissociation , we recall that the dissociation energy of the @xmath98 state is @xmath18 ev . for @xmath0 nm , corresponding to the ti : sapphire laser , the photon energy is 1.57 ev .",
    "therefore dissociation is necessarily a second or higher order process . in figure [ figure1 ] we present results for the proton energy spectrum @xmath101 for a @xmath97fs pulse for a range of intensities . in these calculations , the number of points in @xmath30-space @xmath102 and the number of points in momentum space @xmath103 , with @xmath104 a.u . and @xmath105 a.u .. for the splitting procedure we use , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "for the time - dependent propagation we use @xmath108 .    for a pulse of this length ,",
    "the bandwidth ( fwhm ) is narrow @xmath109 ev , and this is reflected in the sharply - defined proton energy ( figures 1a,1b and 1c ) in the perturbation regime . in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , the relative strength of the two- , three- and four - photon dissociation channels change dramatically with the variation of the pulse intensity .",
    "there is a propensity for the high - order process .",
    "as the interaction increases there is a leftward shift of the three - photon peaks in frame ( e ) to ( g ) .",
    "this is due to the downwards stark shift of the ground state .",
    "the leading - order term of this shift is approximately linear with intensity .",
    "the broadening of the peaks is evidence of the mixing of vibrational levels and shortening of the lifetime of the decaying state @xmath98 . in the last figure ( h ) at the highest intensity",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a large broad peak around 0.7 ev where the field - free vibrational structure is destroyed . at intensities above @xmath110 w @xmath3",
    ", the process is saturated by tunelling dissociation and the spectrum is dominated by low energy ( less than 0.5 ev ) protons @xcite .",
    "this data underlines the difficulty in using time - independent perturbation theory to determine the ion spectrum and yield under these conditions .",
    "the second calculation ( figure [ figure2 ] ) concentrates on the effect of pulse length for a fixed intensity @xmath111 w @xmath3 . for pulses shorter than 15 fs the vibrational phase",
    "is accepted to play a role .",
    "however it is also important to note that the bandwidth has a significant effect .",
    "for example , a 5 fs pulse has a bandwidth of the order 0.35 ev .",
    "this would explain the skewness of the peak in figure 2(a ) , and the presence of the 4-photon peak .",
    "however , in figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) , the results resemble the narrow - band data in figure 1 .",
    "the oscillations in the peaks reflect wavepacket oscillations within the well and we discuss this in more detail later when investigating dissociation from excited vibrational states .     for h@xmath96 with @xmath95 nm and i=@xmath112 w @xmath3 .",
    "the figure shows the effect of increasing pulse length ( a).@xmath113 fs ; ( b ) .",

    "the h@xmath116 state is projected onto a coherent superposition of the h@xmath5 vibrational states , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath119 are given by the franck - condon factors . so that @xcite in the absence of the laser the wavepackt evolves coherently @xmath120 where the relative phases @xmath121 are well defined constants , and @xmath122 are the vibrational energies .",
    "the overall phase @xmath123 depends on the time of formation of the ion .",
    "according to the franck - condon factors , the largest coefficients correspond to @xmath124 .",
    "however a small fraction of the population will be above the dissociation limit leading to shake - off dissociation .",
    "@xcite estimate of this population was around 2.8% . in the present calculations , using the energy curves of equation ( [ morse ] ) , we obtain a value around 0.8% . in experiment",
    "the shake - off process is eliminated and plays no role .",
    "however , the coherence of the @xmath21 states has an important role .",
    "since @xmath125 is determined by the start of the pulse the molecules arrive in the focal volume with random vibrational phase .",
    "the random nature of the time delay is equivalent to averaging over random vibration phase .",
    "we can readily illustrate the physical consequences of this time delay in the proton spectrum .",
    "suppose we choose the initial wavepacket as : @xmath126 then 0.8% of this wave function will naturally dissociative ( shake - off ) without laser interaction . in the calculations shown in [ figure3 ] , we present the proton energy distribution in the perturbation regime for a long pulse . the laser intensities are @xmath127 w @xmath3 and @xmath128 w @xmath3 respectively , with @xmath129 nm and pulse duration @xmath130 fs .",
    "the intensity - independent background that peaks at zero energy is the shake - off process .",
    "the rapid oscillations in this background are artifacts arising from the numerical method .",
    "the lowest energy states emerge most slowly and require long propagation times .",
    "the major source of noise is the splitting procedure that creates an interference pattern in the long - wavelength wavepacket components .",
    "however , above 0.3 ev the interference artifacts disappear and we are confident in the numerical accuracy of the energy spectrum in this range .",
    "the 1-photon dissociation threshold means that only levels @xmath131 appear",
    ". however the peak heights are modulated according to the values of both @xmath119 and the franck - condon dissociation factors .",
    "this vibrational structure has been resolved and measured experimentally @xcite . as predicted by the perturbation theory ,",
    "the probability for the individual peak is proportional to the laser intensity .",
    "very recently , serov and coworkers @xcite have obtained results of excellent agreement with these experimental measurements after careful consideration of averaging over initial ro - vibrational states and over the focus volume effect of the laser pulse .     at low laser intensities .",
    "the pulse length is @xmath130 fs and @xmath95 nm .",
    "full line : i=@xmath132 w @xmath3 ; dashed line : i=@xmath128 w @xmath3 .",
    "the low - energy background ( dotted line ) is the shake - off spectrum .",
    "the vibrational lines are single - photon peaks",
    ". the high intensity lines are 10 times stronger than the low intensity results as expected from perturbation theory.,width=377 ]    in figure ( [ figure4 ] ) the results for high intensity show dramatic differences with perturbation theory . in order to compare with experiment ,",
    "it is desirable to eliminate the spurious shake - off background .",
    "this can be achieved by projecting out the continuum or by waiting for the shake - off to occur and absorb the dissociation . in fact",
    ", the shake - off background is an imperceptible perturbation to the results at high intensity , as shown in figure [ figure4 ] . in practice , for intensities above @xmath133 w @xmath3 ,",
    "we have not found it necessary to remove the shake - off wavepacket a priori . at higher intensities",
    "the two - photon dissociation process becomes important , and in figure [ figure4 ] ( b ) we include vertical dotted lines to indicate the expected positions of these peaks .",
    "again , at the highest intensities , the spectrum peaks move towards the lower energies although the spectrum also broadens . the peak heights in figure [ figure4 ]",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are similar , but the yield is much higher for the higher intensity .",
    "the corresponding dissociation probabilities @xmath134 for each intensity are ? ? ? ? . as mentioned before ,",
    "increasing the angle between molecule and polarization is equivalent to decreasing the intensity .",
    "then figure [ figure4 ] represents the angular - differential dissociation rates .",
    "thus for a spatially uniform pulse of cycle - average intensity @xmath111 w @xmath3 , figures [ figure4 ] ( b),(c ) and ( d ) are respectively the yields at @xmath13572 , 84 and 88 degrees . for pulses",
    "much longer than the vibrational time , the initial phase of the molecular wavepacket is not a significant factor .",
    "averaging over the initial phase has little effect . in the next section",
    "we will consider pulses of duration comparable to the vibrational dephasing time .",
    "@xmath6 . .",
    "the pulse parameter are @xmath130 fs and @xmath95 nm .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate the one - photon vibrational release with one photon absorption from different vibrational states and the dotted vertical line show those with two photon absorption.,width=472 ]       w @xmath3 and @xmath95 nm . the corresponding laser pulse length is indicated in the figure for each curve.,width=377 ]    in the well - known pump and dump technique , for heavy atoms within a molecule , the vibrational motion can be easily resolved by 100 fs pulses .",
    "however for the hydrogen atom the vibration is so fast ( @xmath136fs ) that this requires pulses of 40 fs or shorter .",
    "we have already shown ( figure [ figure2 ] ) that for h@xmath5 , the vibrational phase has a role for 20fs or less . in this section",
    "we consider the effect on the coherent wavepacket of @xmath21 states created from the @xmath11 state , and speculate on whether this can be resolved by experiments measuring the proton emission spectrum .",
    "we begin with a study of pulse length effects for the coherent state . in figure ( [ figure5 ] )",
    "the features of the low - intensity pulse are considered for @xmath95 nm and @xmath137 w @xmath3 , choosing the molecular vibration phases by starting the clock ( pulse ) at @xmath125 . as noticed previously for @xmath98 , for very short pulses the bandwidth broadening and reduced duration leads to a flat spectrum with low dissociation yield . increasing the pulse duration",
    "allows the vibrational structure to be clearly resolved at @xmath138fs and the familiar franck - condon distribution highlighted in figure ( [ figure3 ] ) is apparent . also evident in figure([figure5 ] ) is the interference of the shake - off background with the low - energy spectrum .    at higher intensity",
    "it has been shown that the vibrational signature in the dissociation spectrum can be destroyed to a large extent , even for long pulses .",
    "increasing intensity to @xmath139 w @xmath3 , confirms that this occurs for the coherent state ( figure [ figure6 ] ) .",
    "firstly , the proton energies shift to less than 1ev .",
    "we note that for the 40 fs pulse , the data is very similar to the 55 fs pulse shown in figure [ figure4 ] ( c ) . at the other end of the time scale , for 5fs pulses ,",
    "the protons emerge with much higher energies    that is , apart from the broadening of the peak due to bandwidth effects , the wavepacket favours the high frequency part of the pulse .",
    "however it is clear that in this case the pulse delay , or molecular phase , has an important role @xcite and @xcite . in figure ( [ figure7 ] )",
    "we consider the 5 fs pulse and we present results for the wavepacket distribution in space along with the proton energy spectrum .",
    "the pulse is delayed by up to 20 fs with respect to the molecular vibration .",
    "firstly examining the energy spectrum , there is clearly a strong variation with pulse delay .",
    "the 0.7ev peak that appears in figure [ figure5 ] corresponding to the 5 fs peak with time delay 0 fs is clearly present in figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "the corresponding state in @xmath30-space is the gaussian wavepacket centred at @xmath140 .",
    "the short delay time allows the molecule to dissociate from small @xmath30 values and accelerate along the @xmath141 curve . with a delay of 1",
    "fs the wavepacket moves outwards and disperses , this delay severely decreases the dissociation yield and attenuates the dissociation energy .",
    "after 7fs delay the molecular wavepacket is at the outer turning point .",
    "a pulse applied at this time yields a low yield peaked around 0.4 ev . as the delay time increases the vibrational components separate and dephase . at 20 fs for example ,",
    "the wavepacket is irregular and diffuse as the high @xmath21 components become evident .",
    "the dissociation from this wavepacket produces a strong low - energy signal at 0.3 ev . comparing with figure [ figure4 ] for example",
    ", this energy can only be a bandwidth shifted state . that is , the @xmath142 state dissociating through a low energy photon . in a real experiment",
    "the random phases of vibration mean that these details are often lost . the molecular phase ( clock ) can be synchronized by using the same laser for photoionization and dissociation @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption that primary photoionization of h@xmath4 is a vertical transition has recently been shown to be invalid @xcite .",
    "this is not too surprising since it is generally not a good assumption for infrared light at high intensity .",
    "however it is a reasonable model for uv light or electron impact ionization .",
    "clearly the sensitivity of the proton spectrum is potentially a very useful tool for experimental diagnostics .",
    "the difficulty still exists in that a real laser pulse has temporal and spatial variations that can impede the observation of these details . for a long pulse @xmath143 fs",
    ", our calculations show that the kinetic energy distribution is not sensitive to the time - delay at the same intensity of @xmath133 w @xmath3 . at higher intensity of @xmath144 w @xmath3 ,",
    "the spectrum shows only small structure effects due to pulse delay . in order to test our model with experiment",
    "we conclude our paper with a study in which we take into account the experimental parameters and integrate over the focal volume of the pulse and average over molecular orientation .",

    "full curve : present calculation ; dashed line : experimental measurement from the pure dissociation channel @xcite.,width=377 ]    the experiment @xcite allows the dissociative and dissociative ionization processes can be discriminated by coincidence time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the spectrum can be dominated by the large low intensity focal volume . for a theoretical model",
    "the relevant spectrum is the probability distribution given by @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the peak intensity in the focus center and @xmath150 is the kinetic energy of the proton .",
    "the focus averaging over all these data with the peak intensity @xmath151 w @xmath3 produce figure [ figure8 ] which is in excellent agreement with the experiment for the pure dissociation peak @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many of the structures present in the proton energy spectrum are lost after the averaging process . the small resonant structures in the theoretical modelling correspond to the dissociation from different vibrational levels . at this intensity",
    ", saturation occurs at the centre of the focus , thus a large fraction of the dissociation fragments arise from the outer intensity shells .",
    "this is confirmed by our calculation in which the proton spectrum has a similar shape for a peak intensity @xmath152 w @xmath3 and @xmath153 w @xmath3 .",
    "nonetheless the shape and ion yield of the experiment are extremely well characterised in this experiment , and it is highly encouraging that theory and experiment are in such good agreement .",
    "more recent measurement techniques , develop in the last two years , allow sections of the focal volume to be studied , providing and much more detailed examination of the proton spectrum . these new measurements will hopefully reveal some of the features of the proton energy spectrum described in our paper .",
    "in summary , we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation dynamics of h@xmath5 in strong laser fields .",
    "the vibrational - state resolved kinetic energy distributions have been calculated at various intensities ranging from @xmath154 w @xmath3 to @xmath153 w @xmath3 for @xmath155 nm . the results show the sensitivity of the kinetic energy distribution on the laser intensity , molecular orientation , the pulse length and the pulse delay . at very high intensity ,",

    "<S> the dissociation spectrum of the hydrogen molecular ion by short intense pulses of infrared light is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent schrdinger equation is discretized and integrated in position and momentum space . for few - cycle pulses one can resolve vibrational structure that commonly arises in the experimental preparation of the molecular ion from the neutral molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the corresponding energy spectrum and analyze the dependence on the pulse time - delay , pulse length , and intensity of the laser for @xmath0 nm . we conclude that the proton spectrum is a both a sensitive probe of the vibrational dynamics and the laser pulse . finally we compare our results with recent measurements of the proton spectrum for 55 fs pulses using a ti : sapphire laser ( @xmath1 nm ) . integrating over the laser focal volume , for the intensity @xmath2w @xmath3 , we find our results are in excellent agreement with these experiments .    _ to be submitted to j. phys . </S>",
