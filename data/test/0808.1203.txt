    "`` random structure searching '' has already proven to be a powerful tool for finding structures of solids under high pressures.@xcite the basic algorithm is very simple : we take a population of random structures and relax them .",
    "this approach is surprisingly successful and its performance for large systems can be improved by imposing constraints .",
    "the constraints we have typically employed in work on high - pressure phases are to ( @xmath19 ) choose the initial positions of a local minimum and randomly displace the atoms by a small amount , ( @xmath20 ) insert `` chemical units '' ( for example molecules ) at random rather than atoms , ( @xmath21 ) search within structures of a particular symmetry , and ( @xmath22 ) constrain the initial positions of some atoms .",
    "pickard and needs@xcite showed that `` random structure searching '' can be applied to finding structures of point defects . in the current work we have searched for silicon self - interstitial defect structures using a 32-atom body - centered - cubic unit cell of diamond - structure silicon .",
    "the initial configurations were generated by removing an atom and its four nearest neighbours , making a `` hole '' in the crystal , and placing six silicon atoms at random positions within the hole .",
    "the initial configurations therefore consisted of a region of perfect crystal and a defect region in which atoms are positioned randomly .",
    "this is an example of a constraint of type ( @xmath22 ) mentioned above . relaxing the members of an ensemble of such initial configurations generated the split-@xmath4 , tetrahedral and hexagonal interstitial configurations , which various dft calculations have shown to be lowest in energy.@xcite    we explored four choices of the hole used to generate the initial configurations : ( @xmath23 ) remove one silicon atom and its four nearest neighbours ; ( @xmath24 ) remove one silicon atom ; ( @xmath25 ) do not remove any silicon atoms and take the center of the hole to lie at the hexagonal site ; ( @xmath26 ) the same as ( @xmath25 ) but with the hole at the tetrahedral site .",
    "the initial configurations were generated by placing the appropriate atoms randomly within cubic boxes of sizes ranging from 2 to 6centered on the hole .",
    "choices ( @xmath24 ) , ( @xmath25 ) , and ( @xmath26 ) generally led to us finding the structure we believe to be most stable within roughly 100 configurations , while the larger hole of choice ( @xmath23 ) was less successful and sometimes failed to find the ground state within 500 configurations .",

    "symmetric structures normally have more inequivalent k - points in the multi - b grid than in the corresponding mp grid . during the search stage ,",
    "symmetry is not imposed and we use all @xmath45 grid points , and therefore the multi - b scheme is the most efficient .",
    "we have used the multi - b grid in all searches reported here .",
    "our calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) density functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite the plane - wave basis - set code castep@xcite was used with its built - in ultrasoft@xcite pseudopotentials which include non - linear core corrections.@xcite all of the results presented here were obtained with non - spin - polarized calculations . some searches and large supercell calculations",
    "were repeated allowing spin - polarization , but no significant changes were found in the energy differences between structures .",
    "we carried out convergence tests on the formation energy of a bond - centered hydrogen atom in silicon from interstitial h@xmath1 using 256-atom silicon cells .",

    "the fourier transform grid used for wavefunction manipulation was set to integrate , without aliasing , frequencies twice as high as the maximum frequency in the basis set .",
    "we checked the convergence of @xmath52 with respect to the charge augmentation grid required for the ultrasoft pseudopotentials , finding it to be converged to within 0.005ev at 2.75 times the maximum frequency in the orbital basis set .",
    "we found that @xmath52 was converged to within @xmath53ev with a basis set of @xmath54ev .",
    "we tested different k - point sampling schemes in the 256-atom cell .",
    "the values of @xmath52 for the @xmath55 standard mp and multi - b grids agreed to within 0.002ev and we therefore considered these converged . the value of @xmath52 calculated for the 256-atom cell with the @xmath56 standard mp grid differed from the converged result by @xmath570.04ev , whereas the error from the multi - b grid was six - times smaller .",
    "the searches were performed using a body - centered - cubic supercell of a size to contain 32-atoms of bulk silicon .",
    "we used a @xmath56 multi - b k - point grid , which we estimate gives energy differences between structures converged to within 0.006ev .",
