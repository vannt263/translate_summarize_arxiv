    "@xmath72 , top figure , all three potentials show substantial deviations from the rpa for small distances below @xmath82 , although the deviations of the se potential are significantly larger , in particular for larger distances",

    "the explanation is , of course , that correlation effects are particularly relevant at short distances where the coulomb potential is large anyway .",

    "the sm ( and am ) potential exhibits very good agreement with the rpa potential at @xmath9 indicating that it correctly captures the long - wavelength properties of the rpa , in contrast to the se potential .",
    "since the only difference between the se potential ( [ eq : sep ] ) and the sm ( and am ) potential ( [ eq : sm > ] ) is the different prefactor of the bohm term in the underlying qhd equations , the good accuracy of the latter indicates that the choice of the prefactor @xmath1 is the correct one .",
