    "in 1970 , efimov described a phenomenon occurring in a three - particle system of identical bosons , in which there is an accumulation of bound states near the point of zero energy and diverging scattering length of the interparticle interaction @xcite .",
    "efimov was inspired by the physics of the nucleus of the tritium atom .",
    "however , the experimental signature for the existence of such efimov states was not observed in nuclear physics , but in a gas of ultracold cesium atoms  @xcite by studying three - body recombination .",
    "the reason that properties predicted for nuclear physics few - body systems can be derived from ultracold atoms lies in the fact that the two systems are connected through universal relations , that are irrespective of the specific nature of the interparticle interactions .",
    "since the first observations in cesium , the efimov effect has received a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "several groups now have observed efimov physics by studying three - body recombination in a variety of atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "evidence for the existence of trimers appears as some distinct features ( resonances ) in the recombination rate coefficient . in fig .",
    "[ fi : efimovschematic ] the energies of the efimov trimers are shown , as a function of the inverse two - body scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "a crucial advantage of ultracold atoms with respect to nuclear systems is that the interparticle interactions can be easily manipulated using feshbach resonances  @xcite , by varying the magnetic field .",
    "the two - body scattering length , which is obtained from the scattering phase shift @xmath1 as @xmath2 , diverges on resonance to infinity , and is typically described by the dispersive formula    @xmath3    with @xmath4 the background value of the scattering length , @xmath5 the magnetic field , @xmath6 the resonance position , and @xmath7 the width of the resonance .",
    "this possibility to change the scattering length allowed for the observation of distinct efimov features in the three - body recombination rate , connected to two different efimov states in a row @xcite , confirming the scaling law   given by    @xmath8    with @xmath9 a constant .",
    "moreover , recent developments extended the universal few - body physics to the domain of four - body states which was theoretically predicted  @xcite and experimentally verified  @xcite .    in most of the experiments ,",
    "efimov physics has been observed only indirectly via three - body recombination  . due to the short lifetime of these states , it is difficult to probe the efimov states directly .",
    "these weakly - bound trimers are not only unstable in collisions with other particles , but they are also intrinsically unstable by itself , as trimers may decay to a deeper lying dimer state and an unbound atom . however , the group of jochim in heidelberg recently succeeded in associating efimov trimers directly via a new and promising approach using radio - frequency fields  @xcite",
    ".    optical lattices might provide more experimental control , and potentially give rise to an enhanced lifetime of efimov trimers .",
    "efimov physics can be studied in this way by loading three atoms in each lattice site .",
    "when the lattice is deep enough , single sites act as harmonic oscillator potentials where individual trimers can be trapped .",
    "a possible advantage is then that the interparticle separation of the trimers can be increased to the scale of the harmonic oscillator length , while their properties are still determined by efimov physics . in this way",
    "the overlap of these states with deeply bound dimers is reduced , thereby suppressing the process of three - body recombination .",

    "@xcite , the introduction of the effective range in the approximate equation ( [ eq : approxlambda ] ) for the eigenvalues @xmath63 yields the relation    @xmath156    to get an idea on the validity of the approximation ( [ eq : lambdawitheffrange ] ) , we have compared the results with the eigenvalues obtained by a truncated fourier expansion for a square well potential with height @xmath157 and width @xmath76 , such that @xmath158 .",
    "this expansion is very convenient when one considers the operator @xmath148 , which depends on the hyperradius @xmath44 and is defined via the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eqhypwf ] ) as follows @xmath159.\\ ] ] the reason for this convenience is that in the basis of fourier expansion functions @xmath160 both the differential operator and the integral operator are diagonal .",
    "the matrix elements are then given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 in fig .",
    "[ fi : comparisoneffrange ] , we compare the numerically calculated eigenvalues @xmath57 of @xmath148 with results obtained from eq .",

    "( [ eq : lambdawitheffrange ] ) , which depends both on scattering length and effective range . here",
    "the values for @xmath18 and @xmath69 are taken from the effective range expansion of the square well potential .",
    "it can be seen that asymptotically , that is for large hyperradius , the inclusion of the effective range in the model yields results that are considerably better than if one only takes the scattering length into account .",
    "for relatively small values of the hyperradius , the predictions obtained by the fourier expansion and this simple model start to deviate .",
    "hence , we expect that for short hyperradii , additional details of the interaction potential become important , i.e.  higher order expansion coefficients beyond the effective range approximation have to be taken into account .    for @xmath163 and a fixed value for @xmath18 , the lowest solution @xmath107 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdawitheffrange ] ) can be defined as a smooth function of @xmath44 for @xmath164 . moreover , @xmath165 as @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , if we use this approximation in the hyperradial equation , we can find _ regular _ solutions instead of rapidly oscillating ones .",
    "this could , at least in principle , remove the need for a renormalization boundary condition in terms of @xmath22 for @xmath166 . in the absence of a harmonic oscillator , and in the limits of small energy and @xmath167",
    ", we will see that the solutions to the hyperradial equation are identical to those when the effective range is not taken into account , except that the value of @xmath22 is determined by @xmath69 by boundary layer behavior for small values of the hyperradius .",

    "similarly , when @xmath170 , the solution @xmath107 to ( [ eq : lambdawitheffrange ] ) will be close to @xmath171 , where @xmath171 is the solution to    @xmath172    around @xmath173 , there is a transition from a boundary layer behavior similar to @xmath174 to behavior obtained by ignoring the effective range ( [ eq : lambdaonlya ] ) .",

    "there is a boundary layer , in which the solution resembles the solution @xmath174 of ( [ eq : mu ] ) ( blue , dashed).,width=302 ]    to find the low - energy behavior of the system , which is needed to find a proper relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath22 @xcite , we have to turn back to the hyperradial equation ( [ eq : hyperradial ] ) .",
    "following from the above considerations , the solution @xmath180 that decays exponentially for large hyperradius is to leading order in @xmath181 , and for @xmath182 , equal to @xmath183 , the exponentially decaying solution to the hyperradial equation obtained when the effective range is ignored .",

    "we consider now the case of a negligible harmonic oscillator potential , i.e. @xmath195 , and take the low - energy limit @xmath196 and a diverging scattering length .",
    "the solution will then be equal to @xmath197 , which satisfies @xmath198 f_0^{\\text{in}}(\\rho ) = 0.\\ ] ] for @xmath199 , @xmath200 we determine the phase @xmath201 numerically , by choosing a boundary condition @xmath202 for small enough values of @xmath203 , and by integrating the equation .",
    "the boundary condition ensures that we pick up the right solution .",
    "the result is @xmath204 . in order to find what value of @xmath22 ( @xmath205 in this limit )",
    "is induced by @xmath69 , we have to match the inner and the outer solutions in the regime where @xmath185 .",
    "this yields that @xmath206 .    remarkably , this numerical value for @xmath207 differs from the values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which are @xmath208 and @xmath209 respectively .",
    "it is unclear where the difference comes from , however , both papers use models different from the hyperspherical formalism that we used here , where we base our treatment of the effective range parameter on the descriptions in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "more research is needed to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "now we are in a good position to compare our model with earlier work on the efimov effect in a harmonic potential . in the work of thgersen , fedorov , and jensen ,",
    "the influence of the effective range is studied on the universal efimov effect @xcite .",
    "they considered a system with a gaussian interaction potential , given by @xmath210 where @xmath157 and @xmath76 are constants .",
    "the range @xmath76 has been chosen to equal @xmath211 .    although the main purpose of ref .",
    "@xcite is to show the influence of the effective range , their model contains a harmonic trap as well . in order to make a proper comparison with our model , we take @xmath212",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fi : topth ] and fig .",
    "[ fi : botth ] , and can be directly compared with fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the numerical results are reproduced quite closely and we can assign the numerically found bound states to the different hyperspherical channels . we also observed that if we include the above corrections that come from the effective range , the comparison is better than results obtained without these corrections .",
    "we studied the efimov effect in a harmonic potential by using the hyperspherical formulation . in the first part of this paper",
    ", we studied the universal regime by only taking a large scattering length into account , and by making the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation in that we ignored the coupling between different hyperspherical channels .",
    "the model thus obtained is simple in the sense that the binding energies of the trimers result from an ordinary differential equation , with an appropriate boundary condition for the lowest channel encoded by the three - body parameter @xmath22 .",
    "considering the lowest channel , we formulate an equation for a phase variable , the exponent of which is the radius in a spherical plot describing a surface of values in @xmath213-space ( inverse scattering length , wavenumber and inverse oscillator length ) for which bound states exists .",
    "other such surfaces are obtained by multiplying the distance to the origin by a factor @xmath25 , and there is an accumulation point of surfaces near the origin , analogous to the efimov effect in free space . in the limit",
    "@xmath214 , the efimov effect in free space is recovered .",
    "interesting differences with the situation of three particles in free space can be observed when we focus at a fixed value of @xmath215 . for parameter combinations",
    "where in free - space bound states would exist , the situation is very similar , except that the accumulation of energies only happens up to a typical energy of @xmath216 .",
    "the rest of the efimov states are `` pushed out '' into the trimer continuum ( which is of course only a continuum in free space ) .",
    "higher hyperspherical channels give rise to additional bound states , and by taking those into account as well we obtain results very close to numerical simulations of three - particle systems  @xcite .",
    "better qualitative results are obtained by approximating the coupling between the hyperspherical channels , which lifts the degeneracies and creates avoided crossings .",
    "the lifetime of the trimers is highest for states with a continuum character , i.e.  in the region which we would denote as trimer continuum in free space .",
    "the reason for this is the small overlap of these states with deeply bound states .",
    "experimental study of efimov - like states , however , could be feasible close to the transition from this continuum region to the trimer region , where the linewidth is still quite small .    for a more general efimov model that allows for deviations from the universal regime ,",
    "a natural step is to improve on the approximation of the hyperangular problem by taking into account the effective range . by doing this",
    ", we were able to find a relation between @xmath22 and the effective range @xmath177 if @xmath217 , where @xmath76 is a typical range of the potential .",
    "we obtain the same qualitative behavior as ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite where different descriptions were used , however , the actual value of @xmath218 is also very different .",
    "it appears that the actual value for this relationship depends strongly on the choice of the model and the corresponding approximations to describe the three - particle physics , and more research is needed to understand this discrepancy . in a different parameter regime for @xmath18 , @xmath69 and @xmath76 , such a relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath69 is not necessary .",
    "then we have in addition to @xmath69 , the three - body parameter @xmath22 in the boundary condition for the hyperradial problem to our disposal . by comparing to numerical calculations",
    "we find that this description indeed improves the predicted trimer energies .",
