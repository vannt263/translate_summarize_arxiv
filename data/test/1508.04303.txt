    "neutrino telescopes are right now the only possibility of exploring the distant universe independent of photons . by studying the relic neutrinos stemming from distant supernovae we can derive information about the history of the universe and its star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "it is a well established fact that core collapse supernovae like type ii sn emit @xmath2 of their energy in the form of neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos , form the so called relic @xmath3 background , which is created by type ii supernovae and has been detected in large neutrino detectors such as superk , snollab , icecube and future detectors such as km3net . the relic @xmath3 flux depends on the rate of @xmath4 rate as function of redshift which itself is a function of the sfr history of the universe . also the metal enrichment history and the cosmic chemical evolution",
    "are closely related to sfr and play an important role in the study of the universe . in the recent past a wealth of methods for estimating the star formation rate history have been applied . for a recent review of the observational methods used in this topic , cf .",
    "madau , wilkinson 2014 @xcite .",
    "there is a general consensus that the star formation increases from now to redshift unity and decreases exponentially towards higher redshifts and earlier times .",
    "the star formation history of the universe was the subject of a pioneering work by madau et al.96 @xcite .",
    "sicne then a large number of studies have been undertaken until the recent past .",
    "for example pei and fall compared models of cosmic chemical evolution with observational indicators , the abundance of neutral hydrogen , heavy elements and the dust on damped @xmath5 systems and present - day galaxies @xcite .",
    "totani et .",
    "al @xcite used a time - dependent supernova rate from a model of galaxy evolution based on the population synthesis method . in a similar way , in the work of bisnovatyi - kogan and seidev @xcite , galaxy evolution is considered and it is assumed that the supernova rate depends redshift proportional to @xmath6 . in their model , the supernova rate is much higher in the early phase of elliptical galaxies , and more than half of total supernova explode during the initial 1 @xmath7 after the formation of galaxies .",
    "thereafter the supernovae rate in spiral galaxies becomes dominant and the total number of supernova until the present is consistent with the requirements of nucleosynthesis .",
    "also hartman and woosley @xcite compared a model of cosmic chemical evolution with observations of @xmath5 systems and faint galaxy surveys .",
    "they obtain a a power - law sfr with a redshift dependence ( sfr @xmath8@xcite ) . in most models",
    "the maximum of sfr takes place at a redshift of order unity , where overall rate was about 10 times higher than it is today .    in another analysis of the sfr ,",
    "hogg considered measurements of radio , infrared and ultraviolet broad - band photometric indicators , visible and near - ultraviolet line - emission indicators from redshift unity to the present day @xcite . assuming that sfr is proportional to @xmath9 , the best - fit exponent was obtained @xmath10 cole et .",
    "al measured galaxy luminosity functions in the near infrared from a combined 2mass-2dfgrs selected galaxy catalogue @xcite . on this basis",
    "they determined the mass of stars formed until today and obtained @xmath11h m_{\\bigodot}yr^{-1 } mpc^{-3}$ ] where@xmath12 .",
    "hernquest and springel use analytical physical reasons to model sfr.,@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "they found that at early times @xmath13 generically rises exponentially as @xmath14 decreases , independent of the details of the physical model for star formation , but dependent on the normalization and shape of the cosmological power spectrum .",
    "they conclude that at lower redshifts , the star formation rate scales approximately as @xmath15 . in this model",
    "the peak of sfr depends on the model parameters but half of the stars have formed at redshifts higher than @xmath16 .",
    "glazebrook and et.al study the overall spectrum of galaxies obtained from the red - selected sloan digital sky survey and compared the results with the blue - selected 2df galaxy redshift survay @xcite .",
    "here they used a double power - law parametrization of the sfr with a break at redshift unity : sfr @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and star formation rate is zero for @xmath21 .. finally yuksel and et al studied sfr in relation to the gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray bursts have the advantage that they can be observed at higher redshifts and determine the sfr at @xmath22 .",
    "the result for sfr reported there was that a steep drop exist in the sfr up to at least @xmath23    in the present study we have chosen analytic models mentioned above for studying the sfr . here",
    "we start out with a model which has a few parameters which can be constrained in comparison of such models with observations , which is the relic supernova background in our case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we calculate the supernova relic neutrino density for the different models of sfr . in section 3 , we determine the predictions of the models for the neutrino event rate at the superkamiokande detector . the results are presented in section 4 , followed by a short discussion in section5 .",
    "if the supernova rate per unit commoving volume at redshift @xmath24 is @xmath25 and the neutrino energy distribution at the source ( at energy @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 , then the expected flux of relic neutrinos on earth is given by @xcite : @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the rest frame neutrino energy and the neutrinos are assumed to be massless .",
    "the spectrum of the neutrinos is parameterized as a fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential and normalized to the total energy in a particular neutrino species @xmath30 emitted by the supernova , i.e. @xmath31 . for each neutrino species @xmath32 the energy distribution",
    "is given by : @xmath33^{-1}\\ ] ] from the determination of the sfr we extract the sn rate : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the star formation rate .",
    "averaging over a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for @xmath36 , the supernova rate is @xmath37 , while the star formation rate is measured in solar masses .",
    "following @xcite , we parameterize the sfr as :    @xmath38    where the constant @xmath39 has a different value for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we also assume that the behavior of @xmath39 at @xmath41 , continues to higher redshifts . for @xmath18 hogg @xcite has compiled measurements of the uv and @xmath42 luminosity density and obtained the @xmath43 c.l limits of @xmath44 for @xmath45 model and @xmath46 for @xmath47 model . from the optical spectrographic measurements in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) limits on a were found to be @xmath48 for @xmath40 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xcite . with these assumptions the rate of relic neutrinos on earth will be : @xmath51 as before @xmath52 .",
    "by setting @xmath53 , we can rewrite the integral : @xmath54 the data from @xmath55 gave @xmath56 and @xmath57mev , while the model introduced by woesley et al@xcite predicts that for a @xmath58 supernova progenitor : @xmath59 , @xmath60mev . as an approximate solution for ( [ nuflux ] ) we find : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but the sfr is not always simple and it has a more complex shape in the general case .",

    "the results presented here in section .4 are based on numerical calculations of ( [ nuflux ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) in the intervals @xmath83 to @xmath84 or @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "state of the art neutrino telescopes are water cerenkov detectors , where two general types can be distinguished .",
    "the dominant reaction in a light water cerenkov detector such as superk is @xmath87 with the cross section @xmath88 two order of magnitude larger than that of the scattering reaction @xmath89 in a heavy water cerenkov detector such as sno is @xmath90 , where the cross section of these reactions are denoted @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is a positron at superk type of detector and deuterium at the sno type . for simplicity at the calculation of the event rate @xmath93 , the efficiency of the detectors",
    "are assumed to be @xmath94 in the observable energy window .",
    "superk does not detect supernovae relic neutrinos at all energies .",
    "below @xmath95 mev , the @xmath3 flux is dominated by nuclear reactors and other sources of @xmath3 arriving on earth are not distinguishable . between @xmath95 mev and @xmath96 mev",
    "the neutrino background is due to solar neutrinos and due to cosmic muons in detectors . between @xmath96 mev and nearly @xmath97mev",
    "the background is due to atmospheric neutrinos and the flux of neutrinos at energies greater than @xmath98 mev rapidly falls exponentially , so that the observable flux for neutrinos in superk detector is from @xmath99 to @xmath100 mev where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the energy of positron and @xmath103 mev the neutron - positron mass difference",
    ". therefore the differential event rate in the internal @xmath104 at superk is @xmath105    where @xmath106 , we use @xmath107 @xcite , @xmath108ergs and @xmath109mev . so the differential event rate in the interval @xmath110 is @xmath111 and the predicted event rate at the detector are given by : @xmath112 the @xmath113 delineate the energy window between 20.3 to 36.3 and @xmath114 is the number of free protons in superk detector with a sensitive water mass of @xmath115 ktons and @xmath116 .",
    "the sn relic @xmath3 event rate at superk in @xmath117 model can be written as @xmath118 we have set @xmath119 and also the average metal yield per supernova have taken to be @xmath120 in the interest of obtaining an upper bound to the event rate , while the first number in the right side of the above expression with @xmath121 is equal to 0.066 .",
    "more recent estimates by totani et al @xcite , using the population synthesis method to model the evolution of star formation in galaxies , obtained a prediction for the flux of srn at superk ( in the energy interval from 15 to 40 mev ) of @xmath122 and the `` most optimistic '' prediction for their model was an event rate of @xmath123 .",
    "malaney @xcite used the pei and fall result @xcite in order to parametrize the evolution of the cosmic gas density rate and integrated over all energies and found a total srn flux of @xmath124 .",
    "hartmann and woosley @xcite used an sn rate proportional to @xmath125 and their best estimation was @xmath126 .",
    "kaplinghat et al .",
    "@xcite used the assumption that the supernova rate tracks the metal enrichment rate can be written as : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the average yield of `` metal '' @xmath129 per supernova and @xmath130 is the metal enrichment rate per unit comoving volume @xmath131 and the neutrino flux at superk is @xmath132 or event rate is @xmath133events for @xmath134 and over all energies the event rate at superk is @xmath135 .",
    "here to obtain the most optimistic of srn event rate at superk we consider neutrino oscillation as a mechanism for maximizing the srn flux . we have assumed that @xmath136 and @xmath1 . in kaplinghat",
    "et al model with @xmath137 , our estimates gives the neutrino flux at superk is @xmath138and the event rate is @xmath139 events . for hogg s model",
    "wich has compiled the uv and @xmath140 luminosity density and obtained the sfr as @xmath141 the flux at detector is 108.57 @xmath142 . for the sfr obtained from the optical spectrographic measurements in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "the maximum flux of srn is 111.43 @xmath142 and minimum flux is 91.1 @xmath142 . with the cole model",
    "the flux is 3.02 @xmath142 and yuksel model the flux is 80.32 @xmath142 and then for hernquest model the flux at detector will be 70.13 @xmath142 .",
    "so then their upper bound from models of fall , hogg , glazebrook , cole , yuksel and hernquest are 3 event , 212 event , 217 event , 6 event , 156 event and 136 event respectively and as summarized in the table [ tab ] .",

    "in the present work we have studied the predictions of the different models of sfr for the number of expected relic neutrinos in large neutrino detectors such as superk .",
    "these relic neutrinos have been produced at every supernova explosion throughout the history of the universe , which transfer almost all their energy to neutrinos .",
    "here we have calculated the neutrino production for different sfr models and have found that the models of glazebrook @xcite and hogg @xcite yield an estimate for the number of relic neutrinos closer to the lower limit presently given by superk . as the relic neutrino background is an independent way of constraining the sfr of the universe , this method can be regarded as complimentary to the more standard methods . as",
    "the construction of more modern neutrino telescopes is underway , the predictions of the sfr models for the relic neutrinos can be soon tested with much more and better data of these telescopes . regarding this perspective",
    "the present study can be expected to be extended soon and yield more fruitful results in the light of new data .",
