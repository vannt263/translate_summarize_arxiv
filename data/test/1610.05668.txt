    "variational methods ( vm ) have long been known as powerful tools in theoretical physics , especially in the context of reduced modeling . as opposed to approximating differential equations , approximating the action functional guarantees that the corresponding model too has a variational structure by definition .",
    "this implies that conservation laws are also generally preserved , so a model inherits key features of the original system notwithstanding the reduction @xcite .",
    "one of the areas that particularly benefit from this fact is wave theory @xcite , where even crude approximations to an action functional often yield insightful reduced models @xcite .",
    "the advantages of vm become especially obvious when one deals with media such as plasmas , which can be nonstationary , inhomogeneous , anisotropic , and exhibit both temporal and spatial dispersion simultaneously @xcite .",
    "first - principle differential equations are often unrealistic to handle in this case , whereas vm allow for simple and intuitive modeling .",
    "specifically , a wave theory can be constructed as an axiomatic field theory without even specifying the waves nature ( electromagnetic , acoustic , etc . ) . defining the action functional",
    "explicitly is needed only to connect the resulting general equations with specific quantities of interest @xcite .",
    "for example , this provides a convenient alternative to using maxwell s equations for electromagnetic waves @xcite , which are generally complicated @xcite ( as opposed to the corresponding vm ) even in the geometrical - optics ( go ) limit  @xcite .",
    "but which exact variational principle does one begin with ?",
    "the microscopic least action principle ( lap ) is typically available in the form @xmath0 = 0 $ ] , where @xmath1 describes the wave field , @xmath2 describes the medium , and @xmath3 is a known functional .",
    "however , practical applications in the context described above require a different variational principle , where @xmath1 is the _ only _ independent variable , while the medium s degrees of freedom are `` integrated out '' , i.e.,somehow expressed through @xmath1 .",
    "if the medium response is adiabatic ( e.g.,if @xmath4 $ ] can be approximated with a local function ) , an effective lap for @xmath1 can be formulated simply as @xmath5 = 0 $ ] , as will also be discussed below .",
    "this principle has enjoyed insightful applications , e.g.,in the theory of generalized ponderomotive forces @xcite and nonlinear plasma waves @xcite . however",
    ", when the medium response is not adiabatic , the dynamics of @xmath1 becomes dissipative .",
    "then , the mentioned effective lap becomes inapplicable , and the problem requires a more subtle approach .",
    "this issue has been recently receiving attention in plasma physics @xcite and is also important for advancing variational formulations of plasma and wave kinetics such as in ref .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to find the appropriate modification of the effective lap that would incorporate dissipation under the above assumptions .",
    "accommodating dissipative effects within the lap has a long history ( e.g.,cf .",
    "@xcite ) both as a formal problem of finding a variational principle for a given equation @xcite and also in modeling physical systems , for example , quantizing radiation in dissipative media @xcite .",
    "it is hardly possible to overview the topic here , so the given references are intended as representative but not exhaustive . in any case",
    ", the subject of our paper is different from those discussed in literature , particularly , in the following aspects :    * we do not address the problem of finding a lap for a system with general dissipation .",
    "instead , we consider only emergent dissipation in nonconservative subsystems of systems that are overall conservative .",
    "* we avoid the standard approach ( known under many different names @xcite ) where additional independent functions are introduced that serve as lagrange multipliers @xcite . in our formulation , only time - independent lagrange multipliers are used .",
    "* we avoid variable transformations that are used ( as in , e.g.,refs .",
    "@xcite ) to compensate the loss of the phase space volume caused by dissipation . *",
    "in contrast to theories discussed in quantum contexts , our theory is not statistical .",
    "instead , we search for a lap that describes deterministic dynamics on a finite time interval for a given initial state of the medium .",
    "thus , we can not describe wave fields using the standard fourier representation , and we also have to specify boundary conditions ( bc ) in time , which are often ignored .",
    "in fact , it is the attention to these bc that helps accommodate dissipation within a lap . * instead of modeling media as collections of stationary oscillators ( as in , e.g.,refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we allow for media that are nonstationary , inhomogeneous , anisotropic , and have both temporal and spatial dispersion simultaneously . moreover , our approach allows treating classical and quantum degrees of freedom on the same footing .",
    "* our theory is formulated within the standard calculus of variations .",
    "we avoid exotic constructs such as complex actions or fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "feynman integrals , which are used in related quantum theories ( e.g.,see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are also avoided .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "we formulate a variational principle for a dissipative subsystem of an overall - conservative system by introducing constant lagrange multipliers and lagrangians nonlocal in time .",
    "we call it the variational principle for projected dynamics ( vppd ) . although the work is originally motivated by needs of the plasma wave theory , our results are applicable to general dynamical systems just as well . in the first part of the paper ( secs .  [",
    "sec : notation]-[sec : routh ] ) , we introduce the general approach where @xmath4 $ ] is an arbitrary nonlinear functional and derive an exact effective lap for @xmath1 . in the second part ( sec .",
    "[ sec : losc ] ) , we elaborate on applications of this approach to the important special case of linear @xmath4 $ ] , which corresponds to linear media .",
    "our formulation is equally applicable to both classical and quantum media . in the third part ( secs .",
    "[ sec : asym ] and [ sec : cont ] ) , we discuss various asymptotic approximations of the effective lap for oscillations and waves in linear media , including the quasistatic and go approximation . to our knowledge , this is the _ first variational formulation of dissipative go _ in a general linear medium , which is allowed to be nonstationary , inhomogeneous , nonisotropic , and exhibits both temporal and spatial dispersion simultaneously .",
    "also notably , the `` spectral representation '' of the dielectric tensor @xmath6 that enters the go equations is shown to be , strictly speaking , the weyl symbol of the medium dielectric permittivity .",
    "( previously , it has been known that weyl symbols emerge naturally in wave kinetics @xcite . )",
    "this can be considered as an invariant definition of @xmath6 , as opposed to _",
    "definitions used in literature that have been a source of a continuing debate @xcite .",
    "our work is also intended as a stepping stone for extending the variational theory of modulational stability in general wave ensembles @xcite to dissipative systems .",
    "details will be described in a separate publication .",
    "the following notation is used throughout the paper .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 denotes definitions , and @xmath8 denotes transposition . for example , for a column vector @xmath1 [ eq .  ( [ eq : q ] ) ] , one has @xmath9 , which is a row vector ; i.e.,in this case , @xmath8 merely lowers the index .",
    "we assume @xmath10 for any @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the kronecker delta .",

    "just _ to introduce new symbols .",
