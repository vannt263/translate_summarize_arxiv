    "a pioneering experiment  @xcite on an aharonov - bohm ring containing a quantum dot reported the measurement of magnetic - flux - dependent interference signals and extracted the phase of the transmission amplitude of an electron traversing a quantum dot .",
    "the transmission phase rises by @xmath0 as a new electron is introduced to the quantum dot and the measured phase profile  @xcite near the coulomb blockade resonance is in agreement with the breit - wigner formula  @xcite . the experiment revealed at the same time rather strange behaviors of the transmission phase ; the transmission phase drops by @xmath0 almost suddenly in many conductance valleys and the transmission phase behaviors near two neighboring resonance peaks are the same ( up to @xmath1 ) instead of showing a relative shift by @xmath0 . the sudden phase drop and in - phase resonances were later reproduced in other experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently it was reported  @xcite that similar features persist in quantum dots with a relatively small number of electrons @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental report  @xcite induced a considerable amount of theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the behavior of the transmission phase is constrained by the friedel sum rule  @xcite that relates the determinant of the scattering matrix with the number of electrons in the system .",
    "the constraint becomes especially severe in one - dimensional systems and reduces to the form @xmath3 in strictly one - dimensional systems without any transverse degrees of freedom and without any side branches . here",
    "@xmath4 is the total charge in a system , @xmath5 is the transmission amplitude , and @xmath6 represents the phase of @xmath5 . since @xmath7 rises by @xmath8 near each resonance peak but does not change in the conductance valleys , the strictly one - dimensional form of the friedel sum rule predicts that the transmission phase rises by @xmath0 only near each resonance .",
    "thus in this prediction , a sudden phase drop in the conductance valleys is not possible and the transmission phase behaviors near two neighboring resonance peaks should differ by @xmath0 . therefore the experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite are not compatible with the strictly one - dimensional form of the friedel sum rule .    shortly after the experimental report  @xcite",
    ", three theoretical calculations  @xcite on the transport through a two - dimensional quantum dot or a quantum dot with a side branch were reported .",
    "it is found that when the quantum dot is linked to external electrodes via quantum point contacts so that a transport through the quantum dot becomes effectively one - dimensional , the transmission phase does not follow the predictions of the strictly one - dimensional form of the friedel sum rule and does show the sudden phase drops and in - phase resonances in close agreement with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "interestingly the transmission amplitude is found to vanish ( within the accuracy of the numerical calculation ) whenever the sudden phase drop occurs .",
    "the calculation results are interpreted in terms of the fano resonance  @xcite , which can occur when the electron transport process mediated by a level , which is weakly coupled to the electrodes , interferes with the electron transport process mediated by a level , which is relatively strongly coupled to the electrodes .",
    "we remark that such fluctuations of the coupling strength require some deviations from strict one - dimensionality and are not possible in strictly one - dimensional systems . the fano - resonance - based theory of the experimental results is further examined in the recent literatures  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the electron - electron interaction effect is largely ignored in the fano - resonance - based theory .",
    "experimentally the appearance of the fano resonance and its relation with the in - phase resonances were addressed in a quantum - dot - embedded aharonov - bohm interferometer  @xcite .",
    "one of us  @xcite examined the implications of the friedel sum rule in spinless _",
    "effectively _ one - dimensional systems with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is found that the general friedel sum rule @xmath9/2\\pi i$ ] , where @xmath10 is the 2@xmath112 scattering matrix  @xcite , does _ not _ reduce to the strictly one - dimensional form since @xmath12 can differ from @xmath13 by @xmath0 whenever the transmission amplitude vanishes identically ( transmission zero ) .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained in ref .",
    "thus the experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite do not violate the friedel sum rule as long as the sudden phase drop is accompanied by transmission zero  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is argued  @xcite based on the friedel sum rule that the transmission zero is rather generic and robust in effectively one - dimensional systems since it is related to the topological structure  @xcite of the friedel sum rule .",
    "silvestrov and imry  @xcite reported interesting effects of the strong electron - electron interaction on the transport through a quantum dot that is in the intermediate regime between integral and fully chaotic .",
    "they found that in such a semichaotic regime , certain single - particle levels in the quantum dot couple strongly with the leads while other levels couple very weakly with the leads  @xcite .",
    "thus in such a semichaotic quantum dot , the widths of single - particle levels can differ from each other by orders of magnitude and in this sense , the situation addressed by silvestrov and imry is similar to that assumed for the fano - resonance - based theory  @xcite .",
    "but differently from the fano - resonance - based theory , they focused on the roles of the electron - electron interaction . in the strong interaction ( or large charging energy ) limit , they found that a new electron introduced to a quantum dot at a resonance peak may occupy a broad level with _ higher _ bare single - particle energy rather than narrow levels with lower bare single - particle energy , provided that the energy gain via the hopping - induced downward level shift for the broad level can overcome the bare single - particle spacing .",
    "it was also found that as the gate voltage is increased towards the next coulomb blockade peak , the energy gain disappears in the conductance valley between the two consecutive peaks and the electron in the broad level is transferred to an empty narrow level with lower bare single - particle energy .",
    "it was noted that the population switching of the broad level can be repeated over many consecutive resonance peaks , providing a natural explanation for the in - phase resonances .",
    "it was also argued that the electron transfer from the broad level to a narrow level is responsible for the sudden phase drop .",
    "thus the interaction - based theory of silvestrov and imry also produces a phase behavior in close resemblance with the experimental results  @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit the population switching problem addressed by silvestrov and imry  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the gate voltage region in the conductance valleys where the transmission phase drops suddenly by @xmath0 due to the electron transfer from the broad level to a narrow level .",
    "our study is motivated by the observation that while the analysis  @xcite based on the friedel sum rule predicts the sudden phase drop to be accompanied by a transmission zero and the prediction is indeed satisfied in the fano - resonance - based theory  @xcite , the relation between the sudden phase drop and the transmission zero is not clear in the interaction - based theory .",
    "reference  @xcite is rather focused on the equilibrium ground state configuration and does not address the transport properties in detail . a later publication  @xcite addressed the conductance behavior near the gate voltage range where the electron transfer occurs from the broad level to narrow levels .",
    "however it is rather focused on roles of the spin degrees of freedom and the relation between the sudden phase drop and the transmission zero is not addressed . recalling that the friedel sum rule  @xcite remains valid even in the presence of the electron - electron interaction  @xcite and that the transmission zero is an essential feature for the sudden phase drop to be compatible with the friedel sum rule (",
    "at least when spin degrees of freedom are not important ) , the relation between the sudden phase drop and the transmission zero in the interaction - based theory needs clarification .",
    "the goal of this paper is to verify this relation in the presence of the strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    ", the quantum dot is assumed to have only two single - particle levels ( levels @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , where one of them ( level @xmath26 ) is a broad level with larger couplings with the leads and the other ( level @xmath27 ) is a narrow level with smaller couplings with the leads . @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote single - particle energies of dot states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , which can be modulated by the gate voltage @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electron charge and @xmath35 is a dimensionless constant depending on the gate geometry .",

    "@xcite except for a trivial generalization from a single lead to two leads .",
    "below electron transport from one lead to the other lead via the quantum dot will be investigated .",
    "reference  @xcite addressed the situation ( though only one lead is taken into account ) where the broad level lies above the narrow level ( @xmath39 ) . by using the nondegenerate perturbation theory with @xmath40 as an unperturbed part and @xmath41 as a perturbation",
    ", it was noted that the large second order energy correction ( @xmath42 ) for the broad level can be larger than the bare energy level splitting @xmath43 in the semichaotic dot .",
    "after careful comparison of the two possible configuration of the dot state in the gate voltage range where only one electron is allowed in the dot , it was concluded that it is energetically favorable for an electron in the dot to occupy the broad level in the lower half of the gate voltage range and to occupy the narrow level in the upper half of the gate voltage range . in the next two subsections ,",
    "we first reexamine the problem of the ground configuration in the gate voltage range where the electron transfer occurs from the broad level to the narrow level .      in order to systematically address the gate voltage range very close to the electron transfer , where the bare energy level spacing @xmath44 competes with the second order energy correction via hopping , an equal footing treatment of the two competing energy scales is desired . for this purpose ,",
    "we derive in this subsection an effective hamiltonian that facilitates such an equal footing treatment . recalling that the electron number fluctuation in the dot is strongly suppressed in the conductance valley under investigation",

    "zero is a mandatory feature for the sudden phase drop in a spinless time - reversal symmetric one - dimensional systems  @xcite , and our calculation shows that the interaction - based theory  @xcite is consistent with the prediction of the friedel sum rule ( at least up to the fourth order in @xmath187 ) .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "we first compare the interaction - based theory  @xcite and the fano - resonance - based theory  @xcite of the sudden phase drop and the in - phase resonance .",
    "the two theories are similar in the sense that they both assume the coexistence of strongly coupled levels and weakly coupled levels .",
    "but regarding the roles of electron - electron interaction , the two theories are different ; while the interaction is essentially ignored in the fano - resonance - based theory  @xcite , it plays a crucial role in the interaction - based theory  @xcite .",
    "one manifestation of this difference is the relevance or irrelevance of the signs of the hopping matrix elements . for simplicity of illustration",
    ", we assume a time - reversal symmetric system , where all hopping matrix elements may be assumed to be real . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , which addresses the role of the hopping matrix signs in the context of the fano - resonance - based theory , the sudden phase drop ( and also transmission zero ) may or may not appear between two consecutive coulomb blockade resonance peaks , depending on the relative signs of the hopping matrix elements . in the interaction - based theory , in contrast , the signs of the hopping matrix elements are largely irrelevant to the existence of the sudden phase drop ( and also transmission zero ) . as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ phase_change ] and [ phase_evolution ] , the sudden phase drop ( and transmission zero ) persists even when the sign of one of @xmath187 s changes ( and thus the total phase of @xmath197 is altered from 0 to @xmath0 or from @xmath0 to @xmath196 ) . only its position is shifted by a small amount ( @xmath198 ) due to the sign change .    our discussion",
    "so far neglected the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "when the transport is spin - dependent or when spin - flip scattering becomes possible , it is crucial to take into account the spin degrees of freedom . in this case , the electron transmission from one electrode to the other is described by four ( instead of one ) transmission amplitudes , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and each transmission amplitude may have different gate voltage dependence .",
