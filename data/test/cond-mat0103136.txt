    "about ten years ago , in a pioneering work by janssen , schaub and schmittmann , short - time universal scaling behavior of non - equilibrium critical dynamics starting from a high temperature state was systematically explored with renormalization group methods @xcite . in a few years ,",
    "extension of the calculations to different critical dynamics was carried out by oerding and janssen in a series of works @xcite . some evidences for the short - time dynamic scaling",
    "were also observed in monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it was found that the power law decay of the magnetization starting from a completely ordered state emerges already in relatively early times , e.g. , see @xcite , and it can be used to estimate the dynamic exponent @xmath2 @xcite . in recent years short - time critical dynamics has been systematically investigated with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "simulations have extended from regular classical spin models @xcite to statistical systems with quenched disorder @xcite , quantum spin systems @xcite , lattice gauge theories @xcite , the hard - disk model @xcite and dynamic systems without detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the references given here are only a part of recent ones and not complete",
    ". a relatively complete list of the relevant references before 1998 can be found in a recent review , ref .",
    "all numerical and analytical results confirm that there exists a rather general dynamic scaling form in critical dynamic systems already in the short - time regime of dynamic evolution .",
    "traditionally , it is believed that the short - time behavior of dynamic systems depends essentially on microscopic details . to understand short - time universal behavior",
    ", one should distinguish two different time scales , the macroscopic and microscopic time scales .",
    "the short - time dynamic scaling form emerges only after a time scale @xmath3 , which is sufficiently large in microscopic sense , but still very small in macroscopic sense .",
    "@xmath3 is a time that the system needs to sweep away the effect of microscopic details . in monte carlo simulations , for example ,",
    "if a sweep over all spins on a lattice is considered to be a microscopic time unit , @xmath3 is usually the order of 10 to 100 monte carlo time steps @xcite . for the simple ising and potts models with only nearest neighbor interactions ,",
    "sometimes @xmath3 is negligible small ( e.g. , one monte carlo time step or two ) . compared with typical macroscopic time scales characterized by @xmath4 or @xmath5 around the critical point , @xmath3 is indeed very small .",
    "the physical origin of the short - time dynamic scaling is the divergent correlation time near a critical point .",
    "the divergent correlation time induces a memory effect , and the memory effect can be described by a scaling form .",
    "how does this scaling form look like ? as pointed out by janssen , schaub and schmittmann @xcite , one should introduce new critical exponents to describe the dependence of the scaling behavior on the _ macroscopic initial conditions_. actually , for arbitrary initial conditions even a characteristic function is needed @xcite . furthermore , to describe the scaling behavior of some special dynamic observables",
    ", we also have to introduce new exponents , for example , the persistence exponent @xcite .",
    "the short - time dynamic scaling form is not only conceptually interesting but also practically important .",
    "it provides new techniques for the measurements of both dynamic and static critical exponents as well as the critical temperature , for a review , see ref . @xcite .",
    "since the measurements are carried out in the short - time regime of dynamic evolution , the dynamic approach does not suffer from critical slowing down .",
    "averaging is over both initial configurations and the random forces .",
    "this is very different from the time averaging in the measurements in equilibrium .",
    "compared with those non - local methods which are invented to overcome the critical slowing down in monte carlo simulations in equilibrium , e.g. , the cluster algorithms , the dynamic approach does study the original local dynamics and can be applied to disordered systems .",
    "in fact , the dynamic scaling in non - equilibrium critical dynamics is not an exclusive phenomenon in the world . in many other non - equilibrium dynamic processes ,",
    "universal or quasi - universal scaling behavior has been also observed .",
    "an example is phase ordering dynamics @xcite . in this case , a real equilibrium state and a macroscopic time scale like @xmath4 do not exist .",
    "therefore , short - time is not addressed .",
    "another example is aging in complex systems such as glasses and spin glasses .",
    "aging is just a kind of scaling or quasi - scaling .",
    "dynamic scaling behavior around a spin glass transition @xcite is very similar to that around a standard critical point .",
    "for example , the experimental measurements of the remanent magnetization in spin glasses support not only the power law scaling behavior but also the scaling relations between the exponents @xcite .",
    "after such a slightly lengthy review , we come to what we are going to do in this paper . even though renormalization group calculations have been extended to different critical dynamics , up to now , monte carlo simulations are limited in dynamics of model a @xcite . actually , due to severe critical slowing down , monte carlo simulations for long - time behavior of critical dynamics beyond model",
    "a are also in the preliminary stage .",
    "the short - time dynamic approach provides powerful methods for numerical measurements of not only dynamic exponents , but also static exponents as well as the critical temperature .",
    "simulations of dynamic systems beyond model a in equilibrium are usually difficult .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate short - time scaling behavior of these dynamic systems with monte carlo methods .",
    "dynamics of model a is a kind of relaxational dynamics _ without _ relevant conserved quantities @xcite . if we consider only dynamic _",
    "relaxational _ processes , dynamics with different relevant conserved quantities is classified into model b , c and d. in this paper , taking the three - dimensional anti - ferromagnetic ising model for example , with monte carlo methods we study dynamics _ with a conserved quantity _ , which is _ not _ an order parameter but coupling to the order parameter . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this is called model c. in the next section , we introduce the model and analyze the power law scaling behavior in the short - time regime . in section 3 , we present the numerical results . finally come the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an antiferromagnetic ising model on a three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an ising spin and the sum is over nearest neighbors . for dynamics of model",
    "a and in equilibrium , on a cubic lattice the antiferromagnetic ising model is equivalent to the ( ferromagnetic ) ising model .",
    "now , we keep _ the magnetization as a constant in dynamic evolution .",
    "_ here the order parameter is _ not _ the magnetization but the staggered magnetization .",
    "we will denote the magnetization by @xmath0 and the staggered magnetization by @xmath8 . for equilibrium states",
    ", it is expected that for @xmath1 , the universality class is the same as that of the standard ising model without a conserved magnetization . for a non - zero @xmath0 , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical exponent @xmath9 is different from that of @xmath10 , but it does not depend on the value of the non - zero @xmath0 . for critical dynamics , the dynamic exponent @xmath2 and the exponent @xmath11 for @xmath1 are the same as those of the standard ising model , but for non - zero @xmath0 they are different .",
    "again , @xmath2 and @xmath11 do not depend on the value of the non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "these conclusions are drawn from renormalization group calculations based on the @xmath12 theory coupling to a conserved current @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compared these results with monte carlo simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we study only dynamic relaxation starting from _ disordered _ states with a zero or small initial staggered magnetization @xmath13 .",
    "we measure how the staggered magnetization and its second moment as well as the auto - correlation evolve in the dynamic process .",
    "the heat - bath algorithm is used in simulations . in order to keep @xmath0 as a constant , in a flip we simply exchange the values of _ two _ spins . here",
    "we should point out that if our model is not the anti - ferromagnetic but the ferromagnetic ising model , the ( conserved ) magnetization @xmath0 is the order parameter and then the dynamics for @xmath1 belongs to model b @xcite .    in dynamics without",
    "any relevant conserved quantities , i.e. , dynamics of model a , updating schemes are irrelevant in the sense of universality . different updating schemes lead to the same critical exponents , either in an equilibrium or a non - equilibrium state .",
    "however , for dynamics with relevant conserved quantities , it is different , at least for non - equilibrium short - time behavior . in a recent work by one of the authors",
    "@xcite , for example , the monte carlo dynamics with a conserved order parameter for the two - dimensional ising model is investigated .",
    "it is found that if in a flip we exchange the values of two _ neighboring _ spins , the dynamics is very slow .",
    "however , if we release the condition such that the order parameter is not locally conserved but only globally conserved ( for example , in a flip we exchange the values of two randomly separated spins ) , the dynamic exponent @xmath2 is much smaller . for the dynamics studied in this paper ,",
    "i.e. , with a conserved quantity which is not the order parameter , the situation is somewhat similar .",
    "if in a flip we exchange the values of two neighboring spins , dynamic evolution is somewhat slow .",
    "therefore , as a first approach , we decide to keep the magnetization @xmath0 only globally conserved . in a flip we exchange the values of two randomly separated spins .",
    "except for the updating schemes , all computational techniques adopted here are the same as those in the simulations of model a @xcite .      for critical dynamic systems",
    ", traditionally it is believed that universal scaling behavior exists only in the long - time regime of dynamic evolution . however , in recent years it is discovered that starting from _ macroscopic _ initial states , universal scaling behavior emerges already in the macroscopic short - time regime of dynamic processes after a microscopic time scale @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a typical example is that a magnetic system initially in a high temperature state with a _ small _ initial order parameter @xmath13 , is suddenly quenched to the critical temperature @xmath14 or nearby ( without external magnetic field ) and then released to dynamic evolution of model a @xcite .",
    "a generalized dynamic scaling form can be written down , for example , for the @xmath15th moment of the order parameter , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the time variable , @xmath18 is the reduced temperature , @xmath19 is the lattice size .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath9 are standard static exponents and @xmath2 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "important is that a new independent exponent @xmath21 is introduced to describe the scaling behavior of the initial order parameter @xmath13 .",
    "if the scaling form above is valid , all relevant exponents can be extracted from the short - time behavior of relevant observables .    for the dynamic system with a conserved quantity discussed in the last subsection , we assume that a scaling form like eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) holds also . in this case",
    ", @xmath22 and @xmath23 depends on the conserved magnetization @xmath0 , i.e. , there is a critical line @xmath24 . in principle , there are two possibilities for the critical exponents . in the case of strong universality , the value of an exponent for non - zero @xmath0 can be different from that for zero @xmath0 , but does not depend on the value of the non - zero @xmath0 . in the case of weak universality",
    ", an exponent may vary its value continuously along a critical line . for the @xmath12 theory coupling to a conserved current in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is the case of strong universality .    neglecting the finite size effect and noting that @xmath13 is small , we expand the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) and take only the first non - zero ( linear ) term under the condition of a small @xmath17 . at the initial stage of time evolution , the staggered magnetization around the critical temperature behaves as , @xmath25 at the exact critical point , @xmath26 , @xmath8 obeys a power law @xmath27 .",
    "numerical results and analytical calculations have revealed that the exponent @xmath11 is positive for almost all systems , i.e. , the order parameter undergoes _ an initial increase_. this makes the short - time behavior very prominent .",
    "the physical mechanism for this increase has not been very clear .",
    "at least the mean - field effect or symmetry breaking is not very relevant . slightly away from the critical point ,",
    "the power law behavior is modified by the scaling function @xmath28 .",
    "this fact allows us to locate the critical temperature and meanwhile to measure the critical exponent @xmath11 .",
    "differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) leads to @xmath29 from this power law behavior , one can determine the critical exponent @xmath30 .",
    "taking into account that the non - equilibrium spatial correlation length ( @xmath31 ) is small at the initial stage of time evolution , from eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) it can be derived that the second moment at @xmath14 subjects to a finite size scaling @xmath32 for simplicity , here we have set @xmath33 .",
    "another interesting dynamic observable is the auto - correlation @xmath34 at the critical temperature @xmath14 , @xmath35 decays by a power law @xcite @xmath36 it is interesting that even though we have set @xmath33 , @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) still enters the auto - correlation .",
    "this is because @xmath21 is actually the scaling dimension of the _ local _ order parameter .    from eqs .",
    "( [ e40 ] ) and ( [ e30 ] ) , we are able to estimate the static exponent @xmath37 and the dynamic exponent @xmath2",
    ". then we complete the measurements of all the exponents and the critical temperature .",
    "for details of the above scaling analysis and a more systematic extension , readers are referred to refs .",
    "@xcite and the recent review article ref .",
    "for the anti - ferromagnetic ising model , in equilibrium the averaged magnetization is zero .",
    "if we notice that the order parameter is the staggered magnetization , the thermodynamic fluctuation of the magnetization goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite volume ) . in non - equilibrium dynamic processes without any conserved quantities ,",
    "if one starts from initial states with a zero magnetization @xmath0 , the magnetization will remain zero .",
    "this is the case for usual macroscopic initial states , e.g. , the high temperature and low temperature states .",
    "the fluctuation of the magnetization in the dynamic processes is also zero in thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , one expects that the equilibrium state of the dynamic process with a conserved magnetization @xmath1 is in a same universality class of the model without a conserved quantity , and so is the dynamic universality class as well .",
    "the critical temperature is also not changed .",
    "we perform simulations for @xmath1 in order to confirm the above expectation and to demonstrate our computational techniques .",
    "the heat - bath algorithm is adopted in simulations since it is faster than the metropolis algorithm in the short - time regime .",
    "lattice sizes are @xmath38 and @xmath39 . within our maximum updating times , no finite size effects are observed .",
    "we remind the readers here that it is an advantage of the short - time dynamic approach that the finite size effects are easily controlled due to the small non - equilibrium spatial correlation length ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the critical temperature has been measured rather accurately in simulations in equilibrium ( for the system without a conserved quantity ) .",
    "however , we also present data to determine it from short - time dynamics . with the short - time dynamic approach , in principle ,",
    "any observables which are sensitive to the temperature around the critical regime can be used for the determination of the critical temperature .    in fig .",

    "the lattice size is @xmath40 , and @xmath41 samples of initial configurations have been used for averaging . in order to see the possible finite @xmath13 effects ,",
    "we have performed the simulations with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath44 is @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( from below ) for @xmath42 , and @xmath48 , @xmath46 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 . in principle , the closer @xmath44 s are used , the more accurate @xmath23 and the critical exponent @xmath30 can be obtained .",
    "however , we suffer from large statistical fluctuation if the @xmath44 s are too close to each other .",
