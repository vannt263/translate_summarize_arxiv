    "the primary measurements in physics are the determinations of spatial distances and temporal durations that are associated with the effective establishment of a sufficiently local frame of reference .",
    "this process involves macrophysical determinations associated with the fact that physical observers and their frames of reference obey the laws of classical ( i.e.  nonquantum ) physics .",
    "the basic nongravitational laws of physics refer to ideal inertial observers ; their measurements are briefly discussed in section [ sec : op - length ] . on the other hand ,",
    "actual observers are all ( more or less ) noninertial , i.e.  accelerated .",
    "in fact , most experiments are performed in laboratories fixed on the earth , which  among other motions  rotates about its axis ; therefore , it is necessary to give a theoretical description of the measurements of accelerated observers .",
    "this is done via the hypothesis of locality described in section [ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "this hypothesis in effect replaces the accelerated observer by a continuous infinity of hypothetical momentarily comoving inertial observers .",
    "sections [ sec : sec4 ] and [ sec : sec5 ] deal with the measurement of length by observers undergoing translational and rotational accelerations , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : sec6 ] contains a discussion of our results .",
    "we begin by reviewing some basic concepts and terms about length measurement that are commonly used for inertial systems in special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "an _ event _ in sr is associated with a _",
    "single _ location in space and a _ single _ instant in time .",
    "the _ position of an event _ is defined to be the coordinate label on a rigid ruler that extends from the spatial origin to the event ; this notion is then naturally extended to the spatial coordinates that characterize the location of the event in space .",
    "the ruler is envisioned to extend indefinitely from some chosen origin .",
    "such a choice is only possible in a global inertial coordinate frame , which can be defined only in minkowski spacetime for inertial observers .",
    "the _ time of an event _ is most naturally defined as the reading on a clock located at the event s position at the instant at which the event occurs .",
    "the rulers and clocks used by an inertial observer are at rest relative to the observer .",
    "time is somehow a difficult notion to grasp , especially when it becomes frame dependent under lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "all inertial observers in sr are assumed to be either actual _ observers _ or measuring devices that use synchronized clocks . to determine the time of a distant event",
    ", an observer corrects for the travel time of a signal originating at the event . to perform this correction",
    "the observer has to know the distance to the event by either determining the event s spatial coordinates in its reference frame or by prior measurement of the distance .",
    "the determination of the location and the time of an event are independent of the position of an observer compared to all other observers in the same reference frame .",
    "the time ordering of the events depends on the relative velocity of the inertial observers and the relative position of the events , but not the positions of the observers since global synchronization of clocks is assumed .",
    "the invariance of the speed of light @xmath0 has an additional immediate implication : two events at different locations that occur at the same time in a given inertial frame are not simultaneous in any other inertial frame .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 for any observer implies that the causal sequence of events is independent of the inertial observers .      an inertial frame is globally defined , since the lifetime of clocks can be ideally extended indefinitely and the rulers ideally extend indefinitely in space .",
    "hence , lengths are simply determined by the differences of the coordinate positions of the endpoint of line segments at the same time in such a reference frame , i.e.  @xmath2 is the length of the straight line segment extending from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . in effect , the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime in an inertial frame allows us to sum intervals of time and space corresponding to the use of finite clocks and rulers .",
    "a ruler of length @xmath5 at rest in an inertial frame contracts by a factor of @xmath6 as measured by standard observers at rest in an inertial frame moving with speed @xmath7 along the direction defined by the ruler ; this effect is known as the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction .",
    "it is possible to define the distance between two inertial observers using electromagnetic signals:[sec : op - length ] one observer at rest at @xmath3 in some inertial frame sends out a light signal towards a second ( possibly moving ) observer .",
    "the second observer at @xmath4 sends a light signal back immediately after reception of the first light signal .",
    "the first observer determines the time difference @xmath8 between sending the first light signal out and receiving the second light signal at its position .",
    "the length between the observers is then given by @xmath9 this length definition relies only upon the assumption that the speed of light is constant and equal to @xmath0 in all inertial reference frames ; moreover it is consistent with the measurement of length based on rulers ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) .",
    "an inertial observer is an ideal that can not be realized in practice .",
    "all actual observers are accelerated . to develop the theory of accelerated systems ,",
    "let us define an orthonormal frame field @xmath11 for an accelerated observer .",
    "the components of the frame field are @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "we choose @xmath14 to be the unit vector @xmath15 that is tangent to the worldline at a given event @xmath16 and we parametrize the remaining frame vectors characterizing the spatial directions also by @xmath17 , which is a temporal parameter measured along the accelerated path by _ the standard ( static inertial ) observers in the underlying global inertial frame according to the formula _ @xmath18 .",
    "the condition of orthonormality for the frame field reads @xmath19    the derivative of the frame field along the accelerated path can be expressed in the frame basis : @xmath20 using the orthonormality condition , we find that @xmath21 is antisymmetric @xmath22 we therefore define @xmath23 \\label{eq:6}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 represents the `` electric '' component and is the translational acceleration , while @xmath27 represents the `` magnetic '' component and is the rotational frequency of the local spatial frame ( with respect to the local nonrotating , i.e.  fermi - walker transported , axes ) .",
    "let us now introduce a geodesic coordinate system @xmath28 in the neighborhood of the accelerated path . at any time @xmath17 along the accelerated worldline ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) , the hypersurface orthogonal to the worldline is euclidean space and one can describe some event on this hypersurface at @xmath29 to be at @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath28 are connected via @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the position of the accelerated observer . from we can derive ( compare also with @xcite and references therein ) the relation @xmath33 \\notag \\\\ & = \\left [ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot \\vec{x}}{c^2 } \\right ) \\lambda^\\mu{}_{(0 ) } +   \\frac{1}{c}\\left(\\vec{\\omega } \\times \\vec{x}\\right)^i \\lambda^\\mu{}_{(i ) } \\right ]   dx^0 +   \\lambda^\\mu{}_{(i)}\\ , dx^i \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the metric is @xmath34 ( dx^0)^2 + \\frac{2}{c } \\left ( \\vec{\\omega } \\times \\vec{x}\\right ) \\cdot d\\vec{x } dx^0 + \\delta_{ij}\\ , dx^i\\,dx^j\\;. \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since we started from a global inertial frame in minkowski spacetime , the spatial part of the line element yields euclidean space with its origin occupied by the accelerated observer .",
    "this set of coordinates is limited .",
    "if we follow the above procedure for two different times of the accelerated observer , our new coordinates may not be unique , see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "since we can not accept two sets of coordinates in the same system for one event , we have to require that the laboratory be sufficiently small .",
    "the charts for our coordinates can not be global for accelerated observers .",
    "in fact , such geodesic coordinates are admissible as long as @xmath35 thus in the discussion of the admissibility of the geodesic coordinates , two independent acceleration lengths must be considered : the translational acceleration length .1em.5ex-.1em/-.15em.25ex and the rotational acceleration length .1em.5ex-.1em/-.15em.25ex that appear in equation .",
    "the acceleration radii are connected with the domain of applicability of the geodesic coordinate system around the reference accelerated observer .",
    "it turns out that these acceleration lengths have another independent and much more fundamental significance in terms of the _ local _ measurements of the accelerated observer following the reference trajectory @xcite .",
    "this basic issue is discussed in section [ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "it is important to remark here that one may use other ( more complicated ) accelerated coordinate systems ; however , these have their attendant difficulties @xcite .",
    "a discussion of these problems is beyond the scope of this paper ; therefore , we limit our considerations here to geodesic coordinate systems .      the translational and rotational `` accelerations '' @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend in general on both the velocity and the acceleration of the observer .",
    "we therefore construct the scalar invariants of the antisymmetric tensor @xmath21 , which are then independent of the ( coordinate - dependent ) velocity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dual of @xmath21 , i.e.  @xmath40 .",
    "we define the finite lengths @xmath41 and @xmath42 as the _ proper acceleration lengths_. let us now see how long these lengths are in typical situations on the earth . for the translational acceleration length on the earth s surface we get ( @xmath43 ) @xmath44 and for the rotational acceleration ( @xmath45 )",
    "the result is @xmath46 thus far we have discussed space - time measurements carried out by inertial observers .",
    "we must now consider the results of measurements carried out by an accelerated observer ; moreover , it is important to see how such measurements are affected by the presence of an acceleration length @xmath47 .",
    "in a spacetime diagram an inertial observer can be portrayed as a straight line .",
    "an observer that is linearly accelerated at some time will have a curved worldline",
    ". what will this accelerated observer measure ?",
    "typically , the _ hypothesis of locality _",

    "the radius of curvature of the accelerated worldline is characterized by the acceleration length @xmath47 ; the hypothesis of locality therefore assumes that locally @xmath48 .",
    "it is necessary to investigate if it is all right to reduce all measurements to the linear approximation , especially if we leave the infinitesimal neighborhood of an event and considering that realistic measuring devices are not infinitesimal .",
    "the hypothesis of locality originates from newtonian mechanics of classical point particles .",
    "the state of such a particle is given at each instant of time by its position and velocity .",
    "it follows that the hypothesis of locality is evidently valid in newtonian mechanics and this explains the fact that no new physical assumption is needed in newtonian physics to deal with accelerated systems .",
    "it is important to recognize that the hypothesis of locality is crucial for the physical implementation of einstein s heuristic principle of equivalence .",
    "this cornerstone of general relativity and the hypothesis of locality _ together _ imply that an observer in a gravitational field is pointwise inertial .",
    "a restricted hypothesis of locality is the so - called _ clock hypothesis _ , which is a hypothesis of locality only concerned about the measurement of time .",
    "this hypothesis implies that a _ standard _",
    "clock in fact measures @xmath17 , @xmath49 , along its path ; @xmath17 is then the _ proper _ time along this accelerated path . in the following sections , we set @xmath50 when @xmath51 .    according to most experiments",
    ", the hypothesis of locality seems to be true .",
    "no experiment has yet shown the hypothesis of locality to be violated ( outside of radiation effects ) .",
    "the main reason for this finding is that all relevant length scales in feasible experiments are very small in relation to the huge acceleration lengths of the tiny accelerations we usually experience .",
    "for instance , if we take the wavelength of light for a typical laboratory optics experiment , @xmath52 m , the factor @xmath53 is around @xmath54 and @xmath55 for translational and rotational accelerations , respectively .",
    "as long as all length scales are very small compared to the acceleration lengths , it seems reasonable to assume that differences between observations by accelerated and comoving inertial observers will also be very small .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine critically certain basic aspects of the hypothesis of locality in connection with the measurements of accelerated observers . to this end",
    ", we study in this work the measurement of _ length _ by accelerated observers .",
    "this choice is based in two considerations : ( 1 ) length measurement is a subject of crucial significance for a geometric theory of spacetime structure and ( 2 ) the hypothesis of locality must be applied not just at one event but at a continuous infinity of events for the determination of a finite length .    for practical purposes ,",
    "the hypothesis of locality replaces the accelerated observer by an infinite sequence of otherwise identical momentarily comoving inertial observers .",
    "every inertial observer is endowed with a natural orthonormal tetrad frame in minkowski spacetime .",
    "therefore , the same holds for an accelerated observer by the hypothesis of locality .",
    "it is then natural to interpret the results of section [ sec : op - length ] as follows : the accelerated observer carries an orthonormal frame @xmath56 along its trajectory such that at each instant of its proper time @xmath17 , the accelerated observer s temporal axis is @xmath57 and the spatial axes @xmath58 , @xmath59 , characterize the 3-dimensional euclidean space of this observer .",
    "thus in the geodesic coordinate system adapted to this tetrad frame , the spatial part of the flat spacetime metric is always the 3-dimensional euclidean space as in equation .",
    "moreover , the local acceleration scales associated with the measurements of the observer are defined via equations  and .",
    "these have a _ physical _ significance that is distinct from the acceleration radii that mark the limits of the validity of the accelerated coordinate system as can be made clear by a simple example : for observers fixed on the rotating earth , earth - based coordinates are essentially valid only up to the light cylinder parallel to the earth s axis and at a radius of @xmath60 from it .",
    "this light cylinder , however , has no influence on the local measurements of the observer and the reception of astronomical data on the earth .",
    "in contrast , the fact that such an observer is noninertial and therefore has local acceleration scales associated with it does affect its measurements as demonstrated by the phenomenon of spin - rotation coupling @xcite .    in our description of accelerated observers , an observer following a straight worldline in an inertial frame",
    "is not necessarily inertial .",
    "consider , for example , an accelerated observer at rest in minkowski spacetime that refers its observations to rotating axes .",
    "the observer s worldline is simply parallel to the time axis and the limitation of a geodesic coordinate system established around this observer does not arise from what is depicted in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , but stems from the fact that observers at rest in the rotating frame would be moving relative to the reference observer at less than the speed of light only within its light cylinder .",
    "it follows that in the treatment of accelerated ( i.e.  noninertial ) observers , the worldline as well as the spatial frame along the worldline must be taken into account .",
    "a more satisfactory frame bundle approach is indeed possible @xcite , but such a treatment is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in the following sections , we consider specific thought experiments involving the measurement of distance between two accelerated observers",
    "consider two observers that are at rest in an inertial frame and a distance @xmath61 apart , see @xcite . at @xmath51",
    "they both start to accelerate the _ same _ way , according to a preplanned acceleration profile . this type of thought experiment has been considered before @xcite .",
    "we put one of the objects at the origin of our inertial coordinate system and the other one at @xmath62 , and we assume that they accelerate linearly along the @xmath63-direction . for later calculations , we will specify the acceleration to be uniform along the @xmath63-axis , see figure  [ fig : fig4 ] . to avoid unphysical situations , we assume that the acceleration is always turned off at some finite time @xmath64.[sec : sec4 ]    an inertial observer at rest in the inertial frame describes the positions of the two accelerating objects to be @xmath65 hence , the distance between the accelerating objects stays constant , since @xmath66 .",
    "let us now investigate what comoving observers would measure for the distance between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the hypothesis of locality implies that both of the accelerated observers pass through the same infinite sequence of momentarily comoving inertial systems .",
    "the lorentz transformation between the original inertial system and one of the comoving systems gives @xmath69 which we generalize to @xmath70 this has a simple physical interpretation : the lorentz - fitzgerald contracted distance between our accelerated objects is always @xmath61 , hence the actual distance between them must be larger by the momentary lorentz @xmath71-factor .",
    "it is important to recognize that @xmath67 and @xmath68 could be any two points in a measuring device that is accelerated .",
    "specifically , let us imagine a set of accelerated observers populating the distance between @xmath67 and @xmath68 undergoing exactly the same motions as @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at any given time @xmath72 ,",
    "each of these observers is pointwise equivalent to a comoving inertial observer in accordance with the hypothesis of locality .",
    "the lorentz transformation connecting the global background inertial frame with the rest frame of a comoving inertial observer at @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 refer to the common speed of the system at @xmath72 .",
    "the consideration of length measurements of the standard observers in their inertial frames then leads to equation , i.e.  the events @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the background global frame correspond to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ; therefore , @xmath85 .    for an alternative description",
    ", we should be able to replace the infinite sequence of inertial systems by one system in a continuously moving frame ; for example , a coordinate system that has at its spatial origin one of the accelerating objects ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "to this end , it is useful to introduce at this point the simplifying assumption that the observers are subject to _ uniform _ acceleration @xmath86 .",
    "observer @xmath67 thus follows a hyperbolic spacetime trajectory given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath17 is the proper time along the trajectory such that @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "the speed of the observer is thus @xmath89 .",
    "we can construct an orthonormal tetrad frame along the reference trajectory such that at each instant it would coincide with the frame field of the momentary lorentz transformation and ,    @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from the hypothesis of locality that this is in fact the tetrad frame of the accelerated observer . using this tetrad frame in equations ",
    "reveals that @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so that the only proper acceleration length associated with the observer is @xmath95 , as expected .",
    "the spatial frame is in fact nonrotating , i.e.  it is fermi - walker transported along the trajectory , so that the geodesic coordinate system constructed on this basis is a fermi system .",
    "according to equation , the relationship between the global inertial coordinates @xmath96 and fermi coordinates @xmath97 along @xmath67 is given by @xmath98 so that @xmath67 is always at the spatial origin of the fermi system with @xmath99 and @xmath88 .",
    "if the positions of the two accelerating objects in the original inertial frame at a time @xmath100 are given by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then the corresponding positions in the moving coordinate system are @xmath103 and @xmath104 . from equation",

    "we now can change positions in this accelerated frame and investigate what length is measured from position @xmath68 .",

    "we get the relations @xmath125 and just as in equation , @xmath126 using @xmath107 in equation yields @xmath127 which after substituting for @xmath100 and @xmath109 using leads to @xmath128 and this gives after some algebra @xmath129 = \\frac{l'}{\\gamma\\epsilon } \\left [ 1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2\\epsilon\\gamma+\\epsilon^2 } \\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath112 and @xmath113 as above . again , for @xmath130 let us now compare @xmath131 with @xmath117 , after applying the approximation @xmath132 for @xmath120 , @xmath133 the length @xmath131 measured from @xmath68 in this accelerated frame differs from the length @xmath116 ( in fact , @xmath131 is larger than @xmath116 for @xmath134 ) and from the length @xmath117 , if the length @xmath61 is not negligible compared to the acceleration length .",
    "let us now take another approach , based on our operational definition of length using electromagnetic signals : we want to measure the length by timing light rays .",
    "the relation between the measured time and the length can then be derived from the metric for our case : @xmath135 for light rays along the @xmath136- or @xmath137-axis , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , and therefore : @xmath141 after integration we get @xmath142 from the viewpoint of observer @xmath67 , i.e.  in the fermi frame in which @xmath67 is at rest , let us suppose that the signal is emitted at time @xmath143 from @xmath144 such that the light travels the distance @xmath145 and arrives at time @xmath146 at @xmath68 , since that is the position of @xmath147 when the light arrives , i.e.  @xmath148 , and then back along @xmath149 , if we assume that the light is reflected by @xmath68 without delay so that it returns to @xmath67 at @xmath150 such that @xmath151 .",

    "i.e.  in the fermi frame in which @xmath68 is at rest , the thought experiment can be repeated by sending the light signal from @xmath68 to @xmath67 and back without delay ; in this case , a similar analysis holds except that we have to use @xmath131 instead of @xmath116 in the expression corresponding to @xmath160 .",
    "the calculation for this case yields using @xmath161    it follows from these results that consistency can be achieved only if @xmath162 is below the level of sensitivity of the measurements of the accelerated observers .",

    "a vector analogue of equation then implies that @xmath163 , so that the euclidean length between them remains the same as measured in the inertial frame .",
    "the determination of the distance between them as measured by the accelerated observers can be discussed as in the foregoing treatment .",
    "on the other hand , it is more interesting to consider a situation where the distance between the accelerated observers is defined along a curve rather than a straight line such as for two points fixed on the rotating earth . therefore , in the following section we consider rotating observers and assume that the rate of rotation is uniform for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we consider two observers @xmath164 and @xmath165 that rotate uniformly with angular velocity @xmath166 on a circle with radius @xmath167 and with a constant angle @xmath168 between them as in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",

    "it follows from the coordinate transformation that in the geodesic coordinate system @xmath198 , where @xmath199 here @xmath200 is an angle defined by @xmath201 ; therefore , using @xmath202 and @xmath203 we find @xmath204 it follows that in the geodesic coordinate system , @xmath205 lies on an ellipse @xmath206 with semimajor axis @xmath167 , semiminor axis @xmath207 and eccentricity @xmath177 as depicted in figure [ fig : fignew ] .",
    "this figure should be compared and contrasted with figure [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the ellipse can be thought of as the circle of radius @xmath167 that is lorentz - fitzgerald contracted along the direction of motion ( i.e.  the @xmath208-axis ) .",
    "the angle @xmath200 is similar to the eccentric anomaly in keplerian motion and ranges from @xmath209 at @xmath164 to @xmath210 at @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath211 by equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that equation is similar to the kepler equation for elliptical motion in newtonian gravity , except that in the kepler equation the eccentricity @xmath212 takes the place of @xmath213 in .",
    "moreover , for a given angle @xmath195 , there is a unique angle @xmath200 for @xmath214 .    in the rotating geodesic coordinate system established around @xmath164 , the distance from @xmath164 to @xmath165 along the elliptical arc",

    "on the other hand , let us fix @xmath168 at @xmath222 and note that when @xmath223 , @xmath224 as well from equation ; then , the half circumference of the ellipse is given by @xmath225 \\ ; , \\label{eq:48}\\ ] ] so that as @xmath212 goes from @xmath226 , the corresponding @xmath215 _ decreases _ from @xmath227 and @xmath228 goes from @xmath229 . to understand this variation intuitively",

    "when the radius of the circular orbit is much smaller than the acceleration length of the observer , @xmath237 ; however , the deviation of @xmath238 from unity can not be neglected for @xmath219 .",
    "if the geodesic coordinate system is established along the worldline of the observer @xmath165 instead , then the arclength from @xmath165 to @xmath164 in the accelerated system turns out to be @xmath215 as well due to the symmetry of the uniformly rotating configuration depicted in figure [ fig : fig5 ] .    considering our results ,",
    "it is necessary to recognize that there is no unique answer for event distances when the observer is accelerated .",
    "we do not have a theory that gives us the precise distance on the earth between cologne ( germany ) and columbia ( missouri ) , for example , since the earth rotates .",
    "of course , @xmath239 is typically very small , since it compares @xmath61 with the very large acceleration length @xmath47 .",

    "the main purpose of this work has been to demonstrate that within the confines of classical , i.e.  nonquantum , physics there exist basic limitations on length measurement by accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime that follow from the hypothesis of locality . indeed , realistic accelerated coordinate systems suffer from limitations that are far more severe than those imposed by the requirement of the admissibility of such coordinates .",
