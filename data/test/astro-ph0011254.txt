    "the existence of decoupled cores in @xmath230% of the early - type galaxies is strong evidence that mergers play an important part in the evolution of these systems @xcite .",
    "most likely , decoupled cores originate from the accretion of material with angular momentum misaligned from that of the main galaxy .",
    "a few galaxies have been studied in sufficient detail to explore when that material was accreted or whether the event was associated with gaseous dissipation and star formation .",
    "for example in the morphologically normal galaxies ic1459 @xcite and ngc5322 @xcite there is no difference between the colors or line - strengths of the stellar populations in the decoupled core and the main galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the disturbed shell galaxy ngc2865 shows evidence for very recent star formation in the decoupled component @xcite.=-2    ngc4365 is one of the first elliptical galaxies in which minor axis rotation was discovered @xcite .",

    "the main body of the galaxy rotates around its _ major _ axis , reaching a maximum velocity of @xmath250  , whereas at smaller radii ( @xmath4 23 ) the peak rotation velocity is 80   around the _ minor _ axis .",
    "sb found that the decoupled core is flatter than the main galaxy ( ellipticity @xmath5=0.39 cf .",
    "@xmath6=0.23 ) . by carrying out a careful double gaussian analysis of the kinematics , sb estimate that @xmath7 for the core , consistent with a disk or bar .",
    "they deduced that the rotating core contributes 25% of the light within @xmath8 , and accounts for roughly 2% of the _ total _ mass .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy in which it is embedded has a central velocity dispersion of 275  .",
    "they found that the decoupled core contains a high - metallicity population , with an enhanced [ mg / fe ] ratio as commonly found in giant ellipticals .",
    "sb concluded that ngc4365 is triaxial , and that the formation of the core involved substantial gaseous dissipation and star formation .",
    "however , they could not distinguish formation scenarios where the merger(s ) occur early ( @xmath9 - 3 ) from those where the mergers occur more recently ( @xmath10).=-2    hst images reveal that ngc4365 has a smooth intensity profile with no signs of dust , an average ellipticity of 0.26 , and a very shallow central cusp .",
    "the isophotes are disky for @xmath11 and boxy at larger radii . at the very centre ( @xmath12 )",

    "we briefly describe the observations .",
    "the kinematics and line - strength index maps are presented in  3 , where we consider age - metallicity diagnostics , the mg-@xmath15 diagram , and the spatial distribution of non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for formation scenarios in  4 , and summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "we observed ngc4365 with  mounted on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma , on the nights of 29 & 30 march 2000 .  has a field - of - view of 33@xmath1641 , delivering simultaneously 1431 spectra at a spectral resolution of 3.6   ( fwhm ) , @xmath17 spatial sampling , and 100% sky coverage @xcite .",
    "another 146 spectra are taken @xmath18 away from the main field , to allow accurate sky subtraction .",
    "the wavelength range of the current setup is @xmath248105350  .",
    "we observed two fields overlapping by @xmath220 on the nuclear region of ngc4365 , each field having four separate exposures of 1800  s ( dithered by @xmath21 , one lenslet ) .",
    "the combined datacubes cover a total region of 33@xmath16 63 on the sky .",
    "the small offsets between the four 1800  s integrations at each position enable us to re - sample the final datacubes onto @xmath19 pixels ( drizzling technique ) .",
    "the seeing of the merged datacube was measured on three point - like objects in the reconstructed image .",
    "it is homogeneous over the field with a value of @xmath20 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we took arc - lamp spectra before and after each individual exposure for accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "we reduced the raw  exposures by means of the algorithms described in @xcite .",
    "we used the individually - extracted , wavelength - calibrated and continuum - corrected spectra to derive the stellar kinematics and line - strength indices as a function of ( two - dimensional ) position in ngc4365 .",
    "we measured the mean velocity @xmath21 and the velocity dispersion @xmath15 with the fourier correlation quotient method @xcite , and obtained the line - strength indices , and fe5270 in the lick / ids system @xcite , taking into account the internal velocity broadening and differences in the instrumental resolution .",

    "the reconstructed intensity map agrees well with the hst image after seeing convolution and binning to the spatial sampling .",
    "figure  [ fig : color]_b _ shows the spectacular kinematically decoupled core of ngc4365 in detail .",
    "the core extends @xmath27@xmath163 and rotates about the minor axis .",
    "the maximum observed core rotation speed is 80 at a radius of 22 .",
    "the main body of the galaxy rotates slowly about an axis misaligned by @xmath22 with the major axis .",
    "the rotation velocity rises to 45 at @xmath23 , and remains constant at larger radii .",
    "the velocity field of the main body is not symmetric about the minor axis and the loci of zero velocity ( shown as bold line in figure 1b ) and maximum velocity , are not perpendicular .",
    "we will explore the consequences of this in a later paper presenting dynamical models .",
    "the velocity dispersion falls off smoothly from its central maximum of 275  , and the contours of constant dispersion follow the isophotes ( figure  [ fig : color]_c _ ) .",
    "a detailed comparison shows excellent agreement with the sb long - slit data @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : color]_d _ shows that the distribution of has a central peak , whereas the value is roughly constant across the galaxy ( figure  [ fig : color]_e _ ) .",
    "our average value for the central absorption strength is @xmath24   , in good agreement with the lick / ids measurement of @xmath25   @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find no indication for either or -emission in our spectra , so there is no evidence that our age estimates are affected by nebular emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : age_sig]_a _ we show the [ mgfe52 ] _ vs _ age - metallicity diagnostic diagram ( [ mgfe52 ]  =  @xmath26 ) . in order to probe the stellar populations of the decoupled core with respect to the main galaxy we have averaged the line - strength in certain key regions",
    "( see also figure  [ fig : color ] , enlarged core region ) .",
    "the very central region ( @xmath2716 ) of the galaxy is represented by an open circle .",
    "furthermore , we have identified the decoupled core using the velocity maps and plot the average value for the line - strengths in this region as an open diamond . comparing this with the average line - strengths of the main galaxy at the _ same _ radius along the minor axis ( open square ) we find that these two kinematically distinct regions have identical stellar populations . at larger radii ( @xmath28 50 ) we averaged all lenslets in elliptical annuli ( filled circles ) .",
    "the metal line - strength decreases with increasing radius and there is a small increase in absorption strength .    in order to make age and metallicity estimates",
    ", we use the @xcite models , which utilize the empirical stellar library of @xcite to predict line - strengths for a single - burst stellar population as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the models were smoothed to the lick / ids resolution and include improved stellar population parameters ( vazdekis 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the model predictions are shown in figure  [ fig : age_sig]_a _ & _ c_. the central metallicity is estimated to be 1.15  @xmath29 , decreasing towards larger radii ( @xmath20.3 dex per dex in radius ) at a roughly constant age of 14  gyr ( figure  [ fig : age_sig]_a _ ) .",
    "we note that the absolute age calibration of the models remains subject to systmatic errors , but all our conclusions are based on relative age differences which are much more robust .",
    "the small increase in h@xmath30 absorption at the very center ( @xmath31 ) suggests a luminosity - weighted age of @xmath212  gyr . we can account for this by superimposing a younger population on that of the main body : 6% of the mass in a stellar population with the same metallicity and an age of 5 gyrs is sufficient .",
    "figure  [ fig : age_sig]_b _ shows the @xmath15 relation within ngc4365 .",
    "the central data points agree well with the relation for the cores of early - type galaxies @xcite , suggesting that the core properties of ngc4365 are similar to those of other ellipticals . for @xmath32 , the local @xmath15 relation shows a steeper slope than the global relation , but overall the gradient in this diagram is typical of similar galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : age_sig]_c _ we plot _ vs _ fe5270 .",
    "stellar population models @xcite at solar abundance ratios and for ages 12.6 and 17.8 gyr are overplotted . in these",
    "coordinates the effects of age and metallicity are almost completely degenerate hence the model predictions overlap .",
    "consistent with other giant ellipticals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the data points for ngc4365 lie off the solar ratio models towards larger values of and lower fe5270 line - strength .",
    "using the corrections given by @xcite we also plot stellar population models at [ mg / fe ]  =  0.22  dex , which are a good representation of the whole of ngc4365 .",
    "there is no difference between the decoupled core region and the main body of the galaxy .",
    "sb find that the magnesium - to - iron ratio is further enhanced in the very center .",
    "our data , whilst marginally consistent with theirs , indicate no additional enhancement .",
    "we now explore how the sauron two - dimensional line - strength maps constrain the star formation history of both the main body and the core of ngc4365 .",
    "there is a dramatic difference in the kinematics of the two regions of the galaxy , but other properties suggest that ngc4365 is a normal elliptical galaxy and that the core and main body had a common star formation history . furthermore , the k - band surface brightness fluctuations in ngc4365 place it amongst the old metal - rich ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the elevated magnesium - to - iron ratio is roughly constant across the entire galaxy ( a region of 4@xmath163  kpc ) .",
    "such non - solar abundance ratios arise in populations enriched primarily with the products of type ii supernovae , either in a rapid initial burst of star formation or one skewed to massive stars @xcite .",
    "the uniformity of the elevated magnesium - to - iron ratio also suggests that the whole galaxy experienced a common star formation history , involving considerable gaseous dissipation , thus generating the high central metallicity and inward metallicity gradient",
    ". a possible formation scenario would be the merger of gas - rich fragments at high redshift .",
    "such an event would be modest compared to the rates of star formation inferred for high - redshift sub - millimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "the decoupled core could originate from stars ejected into a tidal tail ( with the appropriate angular momentum ) as a result of a major merger that formed the bulk of the stars .",
    "these stars fall back to produce the kinematically distinct component at the centre .",
    "if star formation was taken to completion and the residual gas exhausted roughly 12  gyr ago , then the decoupled kinematic structure in ngc4365 must be long - lived . the misalignment of the kinematic and photometric axes show that the main body of the galaxy is triaxial , with the bulk of its stars on long - axis tubes and the stars in the core predominantly on short - axis tubes @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the structure inferred for , ngc4261 @xcite and ngc4406 @xcite .",
    "the full two - dimensional structure and kinematics derived from the  data , when combined with our dynamical models ( see * ? ? ? * ) , will enable us to distinguish between a thin disk or a thick structure for the core .",
    "the  maps present a complete view of the kinematics and stellar populations of ngc4365 .",
    "they show two independent kinematic subsystems : the central @xmath0  pc and the main body of the galaxy , rotating almost at right angles to each other .",
    "the misalignment of @xmath33 between the photometric and kinematic axes of the main body is unambigous evidence of triaxiality .",
    "the  maps enable us to compare the stellar population in the decoupled component with that in the main body of the galaxy at the same radius .",
    "we find these populations to be indistinguishable in age , metallicity and abundance ratios .",
    "we find an age of @xmath214  gyr and a decrease in metallicity , from larger than solar in the center to half solar at a radius of 2  kpc ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we suggest that ngc4365 underwent dissipative star formation at high redshift , probably through one or more mergers .",
    "later generations of stars formed a more centrally - concentrated , metal - enriched stellar population .",
    "star formation was complete and the residual gas was exhausted roughly 12  gyr ago .",
    "this also suggests that the observed kinematics and triaxial structure is stable .    it is a pleasure to thank rene rutten and the ing staff , in particular tom gregory , for support on la palma .",
