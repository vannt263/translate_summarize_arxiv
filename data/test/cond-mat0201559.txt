    "biological and cultural features of human populations have been traditionally studied by separate disciplines , but the parallelisms between biological and cultural evolution have been put forward by a number of researchers . already darwin ( 1871 ) pointed out that _ `` the formation of different languages and of distinct species and the proofs that both have been developed through a gradual process are curiously parallel . '' _",
    "cultural traits are transmitted from ancestors to their descendence , in a process analogous to inheritance , and are subject to changes , similar to mutations , by interaction between individuals such as teaching and imitation . moreover ,",
    "they usually fulfill a practical purpose , which amounts to being subject to selection .",
    "in fact , they enhance the relationships within human groups , defining social entities comparable to certain biological species and populations . the quantification of cultural traits has been attempted only recently .",
    "for example , cavalli - sforza _ et al . _ ( 1982 ) applied concepts from the quantitative theory of biological evolution to construct a theory of cultural evolution .",
    "they analyzed forty traits , ranging from political preferences to superstitions .",
    "many of these traits are subject to high mutability , since they are influenced by fashion , individual acquaintances , and personal experience , and one does not expect their quantitative properties to be directly comparable to those of any biological feature .",
    "other traits , on the other hand , are better preserved . among them",
    "we find languages and surnames .",
    "language is essential to integrate the individual to society ; surnames are historical though recent signs of identity in social groups .",
    "quite early , galton and watson ( 1874 ) dealt with the problem of the extinction of surnames .",
    "this problem is equivalent to that of the extinction of a mutant allele in a population , although this relation was only established half a century later ( fisher , 1922 ; haldane , 1927 ) , when the first quantitative approaches to biological evolutionary processes took place .",
    "comparative methods analogous to biological taxonomy are used to determine the degree of similarity between languages .",
    "this method returns the _ genetic classification _ of linguistic diversity ( see for example greenberg , 1992 ; ruhlen , 1992 ) .",
    "recently , a quantitative study of the taxonomy of languages has been carried out ( zanette , 2001 ) , showing that the distribution of the number of subtaxa within a taxa displays scaling properties , quantitatively similar to those disclosed in biological taxonomy by burlando ( 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath0 is the number of subtaxa belonging to a given taxa say , the number of languages in the indo - european family , or the number of species in the genus _",
    "canis_ the fraction @xmath1 of taxa that have precisely @xmath0 subtaxa scales as @xmath2 .",
    "the exponent is found in the interval @xmath3 in both cases .",
    "this gives quantitative support to darwin s observation on the `` equivalence '' between the mechanisms behind biological and linguistic evolution .",
    "a complementary comparison is that of linguistic abundance , measured as the number of individuals speaking a language , with the number of individuals of a biological species .",
    "again , the frequency as a function of the number of individuals has scaling properties both for languages ( gomes _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) and for species ( pielou , 1969 ) , see fig . 1 .",
    "surnames are cultural traits ( cavalli - sforza & feldman , 1981 ) whose transmission bears strong similarity with that of some biological features .",
    "they are inherited from one of the parents , usually the father , much in the same way as the y - chromosome or the mitochondrial dna .",
    "the extinction of a surname and the persistence of a non - recombining neutral allele are equivalent problems .",
    "this is not only a mathematical fact , but has also practical implications . indeed , to assess the multiple or single origin of a surname one can turn to genetic measures , since males sharing the same surname might also share the same haplotype in the nonrecombining segment of the y chromosome ( sykes & irven , 2000 ) . in a very large population",
    ", the statistical properties of the surname distribution can be strongly correlated with genetic diversity ( barrai _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) , and may even be used to understand the genetic structure of a population ( yasuda _ et al . _ , 1974 ) .",
    "recent reports on actual populations ( miyazima _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; zanette & manrubia , 2001 ) show that the distribution of surnames follows the same statistical law observed for languages and biological species .",
    "namely , if @xmath0 is the number of individuals bearing a given surname , the fraction @xmath1 of surnames decreases with @xmath0 as @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . here , however , the exponent is always @xmath5 .",
    "this paper focuses on a model aimed at predicting this kind of regularities , observed in disparate human populations .",
    "[ fig : f1 ]",
    "at the mathematical level , several models have been proposed and analysed in order to identify quantitative properties of surnames evolution or , equivalently , those of nonrecombining neutral alleles .",
    "the main points addressed by these studies are ( i ) the probability of fixation of a given surname / allele in a closed population ( galton & watson , 1874 ; fisher , 1922 ; haldane , 1927 ; moran , 1962 ; lange , 1981 ; rannala 1997 ; hull 1998 ) , and ( ii ) the distribution of the number of individuals bearing the same surname / allele ( kimura & crow , 1964 ; karlin & mcgregor , 1967 ; fox & lasker , 1983 ; panaretos , 1989 ; gale 1990 ; consul , 1991 ; islam , 1995 ; zanette & manrubia , 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , these two questions cover complementary aspects of the same problem . in ( i ) , one deals with a closed population ( no immigrants enter the system ) , and implicitly assumes that the mutation rate is low enough , such that fixation can indeed occur before a mutant form appears .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath6 individuals in the population .",
    "we know from coalescence theory that the time @xmath7 ( in units of the number of generations ) required for a neutral allele to be fixed is of order @xmath8 .",
    "now suppose that the mutation rate per generation and per individual is @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 is the average number of mutants after @xmath7 generations have elapsed . only if @xmath11 , that is if @xmath12 , will the fixation of the allele be possible .",
    "as soon as this inequality is violated , a new situation arises , in which both neutral drift and mutation play relevant roles . in this case ,",
    "a broad distribution of surnames or of genetic diversity are expected .",
    "actually , the value of @xmath9 will be usually fixed by the nature of the problem , while the size @xmath6 of the considered population can increase enough such that @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the statistical behaviour crosses over to the second regime , where the appearance of mutants can not be discarded .",
    "we are then in the assumptions of the models of class ( ii ) .",
    "all the models in class ( ii ) represent systems where statistical equilibrium is reached .",
    "while the neutral drift drives the less frequent surnames out of the system , mutations generate new surnames . for large times , the number of different surnames in the system is much larger than unity .",
    "yasuda and co - workers ( yasuda _ et al .",
    "_ , 1974 ) used a stochastic model for a population with a fixed number of individuals . at each evolution step , a new individual with the surname of his father is added , but he acquires a new surname with a given probability . in any case , a randomly chosen individual is eliminated in order to keep the population constant .",
    "their analytical results compared successfully to field data despite the restriction of constant population , which forces the elimination of individuals . in this model ,",
    "the size of the progeny is poisson distributed .",
    "other models start with a single individual in the population and new individuals carrying the same surname or a new one are sequentially added ( panaretos , 1989 ; consul , 1991 ; islam , 1995 ) . these fall in the category of branching processes ( harris , 1963 ) with an increasing number of individuals in the population .",
    "panaretos ( 1989 ) rephrased a model introduced by simon ( 1955 ) in the context of linguistics , as follows . at each step ,",
    "an individual is chosen to be the father of a newborn and his surname is transmitted with probability @xmath14 . with the complementary probability @xmath15 ,",
    "the newborn is assigned a surname not present in the population .",
    "recently , we have modified simon s model by ( i ) introducing an additional parameter @xmath16 which represents the death rate of the individuals in the population , and ( ii ) allowing for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "preliminary results have been successfully compared with large data sets ( zanette & manrubia , 2001 ) .",
    "this is the starting point of the present work , where we present new analytical and numerical results for this birth - death model .",
    "we describe the model in the next section , where our analytical results are derived .",
    "questions like the role played by the composition of the founder population and by death events in an exponentially growing population are addressed .",
    "we also analyse a system with constant population , which turns out to quantitatively differ from the previous case . in section [ num ]",
    "we numerically check our analytical results and run computer simulations of the model in situations not amenable to an analytical description . in section",
    "[ empirical ] our results are tested against field data .",
    "we finish with an overall discussion in the last section .",
    "our model population evolves in discrete steps , each step corresponding to the birth of a new individual . at each time step ,",
    "moreover , an individual is chosen at random from the whole population and becomes removed with probability @xmath16 , representing a death event .",
    "the total population at step @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is therefore a stochastic process governed by the evolution equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dichotomic stochastic process @xmath21 we show in appendix [ ap1 ] that , averaging over realizations of the stochastic process @xmath20 , the average total population @xmath22 grows exponentially in time : @xmath23.\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 is the birth rate per individual and unit time , and the product @xmath25 turns out to be the corresponding death rate ; @xmath26 is the initial population .",
    "we think of the population as divided into groups the families within which all individuals bear the same surname . at each birth event , the newborn is assigned a new surname , not previously present in the population , with probability @xmath15 .",
    "this probability can be seen as a mutation rate for surnames , but could also be interpreted as a measure of migration towards the population of individuals with new surnames . with the complementary probability , @xmath14 , a preexistent individual is chosen at random from the population and becomes the newborn s father , i.e. his surname is given to the newborn .",
    "surnames are therefore assigned with probabilities proportional to the size of the corresponding families , allowing however for fluctuations inherent to the random distribution of births among families .",
    "consequently , the distribution of surnames is driven by a stochastic multiplicative process ( van kampen , 1981 ) , modulated in turn by the total population growth .",
    "this process is analogous to the mechanism proposed by simon ( 1955 ) to model the frequency distribution of words and city sizes , described by zipf s law ( zipf , 1949 ) , among other instances .",
    "our model , in fact , reduces to simon s model if mortality is neglected , i.e. for @xmath27 .",
    "note that allowing for death events adds a relevant process in the case of surnames , namely , the possibility that a surname disappears if it is borne by a single individual and the individual dies .",
    "since neither the probability of becoming father of a newborn nor the death probability depend on the individual s age , the present model population can be thought of as ageless . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath16 are constant , the probability that an individual dies at an age between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 which implies a life expectancy @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the probability that an individual has exactly @xmath32 children with the same family name during its whole life equals @xmath33^{-m-1},\\ ] ] giving a fertility @xmath34 .",
    "the exponential distribution in ( [ pm ] ) is in reasonable agreement with actual data collected over relatively short periods , for instance , for the united states ( hull , 1998 ) , but contrasts with the poissonian distribution found in data integrated over several centuries , as in the case of england ( dewdney , 1986 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can presumably be ascribed to long - range variations of real birth and death rates ( see fig .",
    "we are assuming that an individual s surname is inherited from the father .",
    "consequently , the model as presented above describes the evolution of the male population only .",
    "the same evolution rules apply however if it is assumed that surnames are transmitted with the same probability by either parent . in this case",
    ", there is no sex distinction and the model encompasses the whole population .",
    "the real situation is in fact intermediate between these two limiting cases : whereas some societies strongly favor inheritance of the surname either from the father or from the mother , other groups allow for a choice between the two possibilities .",
    "in some developed western countries , where the surname is preferentially transmitted by the father , opting for the mother s surname has been proposed as a method to avoid the persistent extinction of surnames , due to the extremely slow population growth ( legay & vernay , 1999 ) .",
    "[ fig : f2 ]      as stated above , our model reduces to simon s model ( simon , 1955 ) for @xmath35 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath36 for all @xmath17 and the total population evolves deterministically , @xmath37 , since exactly one individual is added to the population at each step .",
    "the number of families with exactly @xmath38 individuals at step @xmath17 , @xmath39 , grows to @xmath40 when an individual is added to a family of size @xmath41 .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath42 . on the average ,",
    "thus , the number of families with@xmath38 individuals varies according to @xmath43,\\ ] ] for @xmath44 . to the families with only one individual ,",
    "on the other hand , the positive contribution comes from the creation of new surnames with probability @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 note that , since for @xmath27 the stochastic process @xmath20 becomes trivial , overlines indicate here average over realizations of the stochastic process by which each newborn s surname is chosen .    the system of equations ( [ simon2 ] ) and ( [ simon3 ] ) can be completely solved for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "in fact , ( [ simon3 ] ) is an autonomous equation for @xmath46 , whose solution reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the gamma - function ( abramowitz & stegun , 1970 ) .",
    "then , eqn ( [ simon2 ] ) can be used to recursively obtain @xmath49 for @xmath44 . for long times , @xmath50 , @xmath46",
    "is essentially given by the first term in the right - hand side of eqn ( [ n1 ] ) , which grows linearly with @xmath17 , as the total population . the second term , which contains all the information about the initial condition , can be seen to decrease as @xmath51 . in this limit , the recursion from eqn ( [ simon2 ] ) can be immediately solved .",
    "thus , for @xmath50 , we find @xmath52 the asymptotic number of families of a given size @xmath38 turns out to be proportional to the total population . for fixed @xmath17 and sufficiently large values of @xmath38 , @xmath49 decreases as a power law , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 in the limit of small mutation rate , @xmath55",
    ", we have @xmath56 . as advanced in the introduction , this is the value observed in actual surname distributions .",
    "this same result was obtained by simon ( 1955 ) for a special initial condition . elsewhere",
    "( zanette & manrubia , 2001 ) we have already discussed the fact that , though the effects of the initial condition in simon s model fade out for long times , transients can strongly depend on the initial distribution @xmath57 ( see also section [ num ] ) . in our case , this aspect could be relevant in populations where modern surnames have appeared recently , like the japanese ( miyazima _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "we shall return to this specific point later .",
    "equations ( [ simon2 ] ) and ( [ simon3 ] ) imply that , in average , the total number of surnames in the population grows linearly : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the initial number of different surnames . as a function of time ,",
    "the number of surnames increases exponentially : @xmath60.\\ ] ] we have already pointed out that , in contrast , the number of surnames in some real populations at present times is decreasing ( cavalli - sforza & feldman , 1981 ; legay & vernay , 1999 ) . under suitable conditions ,",
    "adding mortality allows to reproduce this particular behaviour .      under the action of mortality , the growth of the total population @xmath18 fluctuates stochastically , according to eqn ( [ pest ] ) , depending on the occurrence of death events at each evolution step .",
    "the evolution of @xmath49 can be implemented in two substeps , as follows .",
    "first , eqns ( [ simon2 ] ) and ( [ simon3 ] ) are used to calculate the intermediate values @xmath61,\\ ] ] and @xmath62 and the population is updated to @xmath63 .",
    "second , the evolution due to mortality is applied . in terms of the random process @xmath64 of eqn ( [ xi ] ) , we have @xmath65 } \\left [ ( i+1 ) { \\overline}n_{i+1}'(s)-i{\\overline}n_i'(s ) \\right],\\ ] ] and @xmath66 [ cf .",
    "eqn ( [ pest ] ) ] .",
    "naive replacement of the stochastic process @xmath20 by its average value , @xmath67 , in order to obtain a deterministic approximation to the problem , would lead to an equation for which positive solutions can not be insured .",
    "in fact , it is possible to give initial conditions for such deterministic equation which lead to negative values of @xmath49 at sufficiently large @xmath17 and @xmath38 .",
    "a satisfactory deterministic approximation can however be proposed by assuming that the solution @xmath49 varies slowly both in @xmath17 and @xmath38 .",
    "this assumption is generically verified for large populations with smooth initial conditions . in this situation ,",
    "eqns ( [ simon2i ] ) and ( [ simonm ] ) admit a continuous approximation in terms of real variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which replace the integer variables @xmath17 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath49 is replaced by a continuous function @xmath70 .",
    "the continuous approximation can be analyzed at different truncation orders , as discussed in appendix [ ap2 ] . at the first order , the approximate solution to eqns ( [ simon2i ] ) and ( [ simonm ] ) reads @xmath71 for @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for @xmath74 , with @xmath75    in this first - order continuous approximation , thus , the average number of families @xmath70 exhibits two separated regimes . for large values of the size variable , @xmath74 , the distribution is essentially determined by the initial condition . at the first evolution steps , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , this regime covers practically all the domain of variable @xmath69 . as time elapses and @xmath78 grows , however , this regime recedes and is replaced for @xmath79 by a power - law distribution , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 note that , as the exponent @xmath68 in eqn ( [ z ] ) , this new exponent coincides with the observed value , @xmath82 , in the relevant limit @xmath55 .",
    "this result is independent of the death probability @xmath16 . for sufficiently long times",
    ", the power - law regime will be observed for all the relevant family sizes .",
    "all the contribution of the initial condition will become restricted to the domain of the largest families .",
    "the boundary @xmath83 between the two regimes , eqn ( [ yc ] ) , grows as a power of the ratio between the average current population @xmath84 and the initial population @xmath26 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the exponent is practically equal to unity .",
    "consequently , for the boundary to reach a given value @xmath86 , in such a way that all the families with sizes below @xmath86 are in the power - law regime , the total population must grow by a factor practically equal to @xmath86 .",
    "taking into account eqn ( [ pt ] ) , the position of the boundary as a function of real time reads @xmath87.\\ ] ] the transient @xmath88 needed for the power - law regime to develop up to a given size @xmath86 is therefore logarithmic , @xmath89 .",
    "the average total number of surnames in the continuous approximation is calculated by analogy with eqn ( [ ns ] ) : @xmath90 using the above first - order solution for @xmath70 , we find @xmath91 or , as a function of time , @xmath92 - 1\\ } , \\ ] ] as shown in appendix [ ap2 ] [ cf .",
    "eqn ( [ n0 ] ) ] . in consequence , within this approximation , the surname diversity always grows exponentially .",
    "we point out , however , that this conclusion is valid for sufficiently smooth distributions and for @xmath93 , two necessary conditions for the continuous approximation to apply to our problem .",
    "it could therefore be argued that having a decreasing number of surnames , as found in some modern developed societies ( cavalli - sforza & feldman , 1981 ; legay & vernay , 1999 ) , requires violation of the above conditions .",
    "for instance , an initial condition with sharp variations would violate the smoothness condition during the first evolution stages . a death probability",
    "@xmath94 would also threaten the validity of the continuous approximation .",
    "this is precisely the case of modern developed societies , where the population growth rate is practically vanishing and , as a matter of fact , reaches occasionally negative values a situation not described by the present model . in section [ mu1 ] we treat the special case @xmath95 and show that , in this limit , the total number of surnames can in fact decrease .",
    "though the first - order continuous approximation gives a rather rough description of the solution to our model , as a piecewise function with a moving discontinuity , it provides a quite clear qualitative picture of how the solution behaves .",
    "the growth of the power - law regime as the initial condition recedes is in good qualitative agreement with the evolution observed in numerical realizations of the model .",
    "a better analytical approximation is obtained from the second - order truncation .",
    "second - order derivatives would in fact introduce diffusive - like effects in the variable @xmath69 , with the consequent smoothing of the discontinuities of the first - order approximation .",
    "the second - order equation , however , can not be analytically solved for arbitrary initial conditions . nevertheless , it is possible to give an asymptotic approximation for long times , as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the kummer s function ( see appendix [ ap2 ] ) .",
    "with respect to the first - order approximation , eqn ( [ sol1 ] ) , this solution predicts a lower value of @xmath70 for small @xmath69 . for larger family sizes ,",
    "however , it behaves as a power law , @xmath98 with exactly the same exponent as in eqn ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour for large @xmath69 in the power - law regime is therefore not modified .",
    "it must be pointed out that , for small values of @xmath15 , the profile of @xmath70 given by eqn ( [ secorder ] ) results to be quite independent of the death probability over a considerable range of values of @xmath16 . only for @xmath99 , where the exponent @xmath100 strongly depends on @xmath16 ,",
    "does @xmath70 change sensibly as @xmath16 is varied .",
    "we take advantage of this feature in section [ empirical ] , where the second - order approximation is compared with actual data of surname distributions .",
    "as argued above , the limit @xmath95 is relevant to the discussion of the evolution of surname distributions in some modern developed societies .",
    "in fact , this limit corresponds to the case where the population growth rate vanishes , a situation which is closely approached , for instance , in many european countries . in this case , eqn ( [ simonm ] ) is again deterministic , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the total population at any time is @xmath103 .",
    "the main difference between this case and that of @xmath104 is that , now , the distribution @xmath49 becomes independent of time for asymptotically large times .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the fact that the asymptotic distribution for @xmath104 is proportional to the total population @xmath18 .",
    "the asymptotic surname distribution @xmath105 is given , for @xmath27 , by the recurrence equations @xmath106i{\\overline}n_i^\\infty -(1-\\alpha )   ( p_0 + 1-i)(i-1){\\overline}n_{i-1}^\\infty}{(i+1)[p_0-(1-\\alpha)(i+1)]}\\ ] ] for @xmath44 , and @xmath107{\\overline}n_1^\\infty - \\alpha p_0 ^ 2}{2[p_0 - 2(1-\\alpha)(i+1 ) ] } .\\ ] ] note that , since the total population is always @xmath26 , we have @xmath108 for @xmath109 , as no family can be larger than @xmath26 .",
    "the solution reveals two well - defined regimes , depending on how the product @xmath110 compares with unity . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the asymptotic distribution behaves as @xmath112 for a vast range of family sizes .",
    "departures from this behaviour are found very close to @xmath113 only . for @xmath109 ,",
    "in fact , the distribution must vanish .",
    "we stress the remarkable difference between the exponential stationary distribution ( [ est ] ) and the long - time power - law solution obtained for @xmath104 . in this regime ,",
    "the stationary total number of surnames is @xmath114    for @xmath115 , on the other hand , the distribution behaves as a power law , @xmath116 , over practically the whole range of family sizes .",
    "note that the exponent of this power law is in agreement with eqn ( [ sol1 ] ) in the limit @xmath117 . for @xmath118",
    ", however , the distribution deviates from the power law and exhibits a sharp peak . in the limit @xmath119 ,",
    "the distribution becomes an isolated peak at @xmath113 , namely , @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the total number of surnames is @xmath123 .",
    "this special solution describes the well - known case of a closed population with no surname mutations where , by random drift , a single surname survives for asymptotically large times ( cavalli - sforza & feldman , 1981 ) .",
    "notice also that this limit corresponds to the birth - death model introduced by moran ( 1962 ) to study probabilities of fixation of alleles when generations overlap .",
    "we conclude that , for a given population @xmath26 , the asymptotic number of surnames can be very small if the mutation probability @xmath15 is , in turn , small enough . consequently , in a steady population with many surnames at the initial stage and with a sufficiently low mutation probability , the number of surnames will decrease towards the stationary value as time elapses .",
    "numerical simulations , discussed in detail in the next section , show that for @xmath16 just below unity and small @xmath15 , an initial transient where the number of surnames decreases temporarily can be observed .",
    "since @xmath104 , however , the population grows steadily and , as a consequence of mutations , @xmath124 will also increase in the long run .",
    "the situation in modern developed societies is that the population growth rate has been constantly decreasing , to reach values around zero at present times .",
    "starting from a state with a wealth of surnames due to the combined effect , a few centuries ago , of a high population growth and the frequent appearance of new surnames these societies have now reached a regime of almost stationary population where the number of surnames decreases .",
    "this situation would be reverted if the growth rate could be maintained above zero during substantial periods .",
    "presently , the only mechanism acting in this direction seems to be immigration , which is in addition an effective source of new surnames .",
    "in this section we present results of numerical realizations of our model , in order to compare with the analytical approximations presented in section [ analytic ] , and to illustrate the behaviour within the regimes where such approximations do not hold .",
    "emphasis is put on the role of the initial conditions , the duration of transients , and the evolution of the number of different surnames . also , we discuss actual surname distributions of modern populations in the light of our results .      first , it is worthwhile to illustrate how the shape of the distribution @xmath49 depends on the initial condition @xmath57 [ see also zanette & manrubia ( 2001 ) ] .",
    "we focus the attention on initial distributions of the form @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , in which there are @xmath59 families of equal size formed by @xmath129 individuals each .",
    "consequently , the initial population is @xmath130 . in the following ,",
    "we denote such an initial condition by the pair @xmath131 .",
    "figure 3 shows four normalized distributions of family sizes , @xmath132 obtained both from the numerical realization of the stochastic birth - death model and from the iterative solution of the deterministic eqns ( [ simon2 ] ) and ( [ simon3 ] ) , for @xmath27 .",
    "we find a very good agreement between both methods and , at the same time , clearly realize the relevant role of the initial condition in determining the profile of the distribution for large family sizes .",
    "these same features are found for other values of the death probability .",
    "the solution of the first - order approximation to our model , eqns ( [ sol1 ] ) to ( [ yc ] ) , predicts that in the zone of small family sizes i.e . for @xmath79 in the continuous variables the only dependence on the initial condition appears through the quantity @xmath26",
    "this means that the distribution of family sizes is not sensitive to a variation of @xmath129 and @xmath59 as far as their product is kept constant .",
    "note that the three cases @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 of fig . 3 share the same value of @xmath136 .",
    "for the parameters of the figure , the crossover between the regions of small and large family sizes , given for the continuous variables by eqn ( [ yc ] ) , should occur at @xmath137 .",
    "though two of the distributions indeed have the same profile with the expected power - law decay up to that value , the distribution corresponding to the initial condition @xmath134 deviates considerably below @xmath138 .",
    "this deviation can be attributed to the fact that the initial condition @xmath134 corresponds to a quite singular distribution , with a high peak at @xmath139 .",
    "a continuous approximation for such a distribution is arguably expected to give a poor description of the real situation .",
    "equation ( [ yc ] ) defines , within the first - order approximation , the boundary that separates the asymptotic regime and the zone dominated by the initial condition .",
    "alternatively , for a fixed family size , it can be used to determine the transient before the asymptotic distribution builds up at that size . in order to test this aspect of the first - order approximation ,",
    "we have devised an independent computational method to evaluate the point at which the cut - off between the two regimes actually takes place . according to eqns ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ p_i ] ) ,",
    "the asymptotic normalized distribution of family sizes is @xmath140 . in numerical realizations ,",
    "the distribution is expected to adopt values very close to @xmath141 for large @xmath38 and large enough @xmath17 . in the simulations ,",
    "we fix a certain family size @xmath138 and stop the calculation at the step @xmath142 when the measured value of @xmath143 satisfies , for the first time , @xmath144 . the results presented in the following correspond to the choice @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "since , as shown in section [ initcond ] , the agreement between the numerical simulations of the stochastic birth - death model and the iterative solution of the corresponding average equations is very good , we use this second description to measure the transient @xmath142 .",
    "we focus the analysis on the dependence with the initial conditions , and keep the values of @xmath147 and @xmath27 fixed . as far as @xmath148 ,",
    "the results are qualitatively the same for other values of @xmath16 .",
    "we consider initial conditions of the form @xmath131 , as defined in section [ initcond ] .",
    "figure 4 shows the transient @xmath142 measured from the numerical solution to eqns ( [ simon2 ] ) and ( [ simon3 ] ) according to the criterion introduced above , as a function of @xmath129 and @xmath59 . on the one hand , for small @xmath59 and , especially , for small @xmath129 , @xmath142 varies quite irregularly .",
    "on the other hand , we see that for larger values of @xmath129 and @xmath59 , say @xmath149 and @xmath150 , @xmath142 exhibits a well - defined linear dependence with both parameters . in this regime ,",
    "the transient is well approximated by @xmath151    [ fig : i0 ]    linear fitting of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath129 and @xmath59 for the data shown in fig .",
    "4 yields @xmath152 . note that eqn ( [ stn ] ) implies that , for large @xmath129 and @xmath59 the transient length is proportional to the initial population @xmath153 .",
    "this is to be compared with the analogous result within the first - order approximation , eqn ( [ yc ] ) , which implies @xmath154.\\ ] ] the first - order approximation predicts then a proportionality between @xmath142 and @xmath26 independently of the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in full agreement with the numerical results .",
    "we point out , however , that the corresponding proportionality coefficients can not be directly compared .",
    "in fact , the coefficient @xmath155 in eqn ( [ stn ] ) is evaluated following the computational definition of the transient , and thus depends on the parameter @xmath156 , which has no correlate in the analytical approach .",
    "note , nevertheless , that for @xmath148 and @xmath27 eqn ( [ sta ] ) predicts a coefficient approximately equal to @xmath157 , which is of the same order as the numerical result .      as discussed in section [ model ] ,",
    "the evolution of the average number @xmath158 of different surnames is driven in our model by two competing mechanisms .",
    "the diversity increases due to the appearance of new surnames at rate @xmath15 , and surnames borne by single individuals disappear when the individual in question dies .",
    "within the first - order continuous approximation to our model , for @xmath104 , the average number of different surnames increases linearly with @xmath17 as @xmath159 ( see section [ analytic ] ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the death probability @xmath16 plays a role in the variation of diversity as a function of time , eqn ( [ nmu ] ) . on the one hand , increase of the surname diversity in a steadily growing population",
    "is generally expected when new surnames are created at a constant rate . on the other ,",
    "it is possible to conceive special situations where the number of different surnames should temporarily decrease , violating the first - order approximation .",
    "imagine , for instance , that the initial population consists of an ensemble of families with only one individual each . for moderate values of @xmath16 and small @xmath15 ,",
    "the initial stage would be characterized by the death of some individuals , with the consequent disappearance of their surnames , and no significative appearance of new surnames .",
    "since the total population grows , however , @xmath158 will eventually attain a minimum and , from then on , will increase .",
    "to illustrate this situation , we numerically solve eqns ( [ simon2i ] ) to ( [ simonm ] ) for the initial condition @xmath134 , with @xmath160 families of one individual each .",
    "note that this is the initial condition for which we detected the largest deviations from the first - order approximation in section [ initcond ] .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of @xmath158 for different values of @xmath16 .",
    "as expected , an initial transient where the surname diversity drops is found for @xmath161 .",
    "the transient is longer and the minimum in @xmath162 is deeper as @xmath16 grows . in all cases ,",
    "however , the subsequent growth of @xmath158 is clearly seen .",
    "note that the slope of this growth depends slightly on @xmath16 , a feature not predicted by the first - order continuous approximation .",
    "these long transients where ( for large @xmath16 and suitable initial conditions ) the number of different surnames is expected to decrease could be relevant to the description of modern populations with declining diversity ( cavalli - sforza & feldman , 1981 ; legay & vernay , 1999 ) .",
    "a realistic description of this situation should however take into account that , in recent times , the relative values of birth and death rates in actual populations have considerably changed .",
    "the general trend to population growth observed worldwide in the nineteenth century has by now been reversed in many developed areas , such as in europe , where the total population is practically stationary . in our model , this corresponds to an increment in the value of @xmath16 to values close to unity . in particular , the death probability must be allowed to vary with time .",
    "additionally , if the description is expected to encompass the periods where the appearance of new surnames was frequent specifically , the middle ages in the case of europe @xmath15 should also change during the evolution .    as a qualitative demonstration of the effect of varying the model parameters with time , we focus the attention on a change of @xmath16 from a low value to a high value . for the initial condition",
    "@xmath134 we fix @xmath27 during the first @xmath163 evolution steps . then , @xmath16 is left to increase linearly with @xmath17 , such that it reaches unity after @xmath164 additional steps . in the numerical calculations shown in fig .",
    "6 we fix @xmath165 and consider several values of @xmath163 . for @xmath166 , the number of different surnames increases ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) .",
    "then , as the death probability grows , @xmath158 attains a maximum and begins to decrease . for",
    "asymptotically large times , it is expected to approach a stationary value , as predicted for the case @xmath95 in section [ mu1 ] .",
    "interestingly , @xmath158 responds faster to the effects of growing @xmath16 for smaller values of @xmath163 , where the contribution of the initial condition is still important during the variation of the death probability .",
    "the asymptotic surname distribution seems to be , in this sense , quite robust to the action of varying @xmath16 .",
    "this feature should be related to the fact that the asymptotic distribution is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath16 , as discussed at the end of section [ analytic ] .",
    "finally , we compare some of the analytical results for our model , derived under several approximations in section [ analytic ] , with actual data from three modern populations . specifically , we focus the attention on the second - order approximation , eqn ( [ secorder ] ) , for the asymptotic distribution of surnames in the range of small family sizes , where the effect of the initial condition is negligible . in fact , it is virtually impossible to extract information on the distribution of surnames in historical times from the data presently available .",
    "we recall that eqn ( [ secorder ] ) correctly describes the asymptotic power law @xmath98 with @xmath167 , as observed in real data .",
    "the validity of our second - order approximation is therefore to be especially evaluated in the region of very small family sizes , where the distribution differs from the power law .",
    "our three data sets were obtained from surname counts in telephone books .",
    "they correspond to ( i ) the almost 350,000 different surnames of the whole 1996 argentine telephone book , ( ii ) the 6,400 surnames beginning by a in the 1996 berlin telephone book , and ( iii ) the surnames in five japanese cities , with populations ranging between @xmath168 and @xmath169 , reported by miyazima _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "let us point out that the three populations involved here have considerably different demographic history .",
    "the modern argentine population has predominantly european ancestors , who immigrated mainly in the period 1880 - 1915 and just after the world war ii .",
    "their surname distribution has therefore to be considered as a combined sample from the countries that contributed the immigrants . from the times of the largest immigration waves to the present ,",
    "both the birth and death rates have substantially changed . as for berlin",
    ", this city was practically abandoned in the late stages of world war ii and subsequently repopulated with a mixture of the ancient inhabitants and newcomers from other cities of germany . in this case , the surname distribution has consequently resulted from a combination of several german regions . the modern population in berlin , in addition , presents the particularity of having been artificially separated into two practically immiscible groups during several decades , ending in 1989 .",
    "since european surnames appeared mostly during the middle ages ( legay & vernay , 1999 ) , the populations that contributed surnames to both argentina and berlin are expected to have developed the asymptotic surname distribution on a substantial range of family sizes .",
    "this situation contrasts with the case of modern japanese surnames , that were originated some @xmath170 years ago ( miyazima _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "in japan , moreover , the contribution of immigration in the relevant period should have been considerably less important than in berlin and argentina .",
    "explicit evaluation of eqn ( [ secorder ] ) requires fixing the values of the mutation rate @xmath15 and the death probability @xmath16 .",
    "we know that the mutation rate , i.e. the probability that a new individual acquires a surname not previously present in the population , is very low for any modern society . since , as far as @xmath171 , the limit of eqn ( [ secorder ] ) for @xmath172 is well defined , fixing any sufficiently small value for @xmath15 gives a correct description of @xmath70 . in our comparison with real data ,",
    "we have taken @xmath173 .",
    "as for the death probability @xmath16 , unfortunately , we have found it impossible to fix a reliable value .",
    "for all real populations , mortality has considerably changed during the periods relevant to the evolution of surname frequencies . moreover , since @xmath16 measures the relative frequency of death and birth events the latter also including , in real populations , arrival of new individuals by immigration an evaluation of the death probability should also involve a detailed description of immigration effects . on the other hand , as discussed at the end of section [ analytic ] , the asymptotic profile of @xmath70 , given by eqn ( [ secorder ] ) , is practically independent of the death probability as far as @xmath16 is not close to unity .",
    "we therefore decided to fit the field data with eqn ( [ secorder ] ) allowing @xmath16 to vary in order to get the best approximation in the relevant zone of small family sizes .",
    "figure 7 shows the three data sets and the corresponding fittings with eqn ( [ secorder ] ) .",
    "fittings have been optimized in the domain of small family sizes , where our analytical approximation is expected to hold . in the case of argentina",
    ", the agreement with real data is excellent up to family sizes above @xmath174 . only for @xmath175 a systematic deviation",
    "is observed , where the analytical result overestimates the frequency .",
    "according to our discussion in section [ analytic ] , this deviation would be the remnant contribution of initial conditions .",
    "for the berlin data , the statistics are poorer .",
    "however , it is clear that the analytical approximation fits the data with good precision in the whole range shown here . in the case of the japanese data",
    "the fitting is very good for relatively small family sizes , @xmath176 , but , on the other hand , noticeable systematic deviations appear for @xmath177 .",
    "this agrees with our expectation on the effect of initial conditions . in the @xmath170 years elapsed from the appearance of modern japanese family names ,",
    "the population in the cities from which the present data were obtained has increased by a factor of , at most , order @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , according to eqn ( [ yc ] ) , initial conditions should contribute to the distribution for relatively small family sizes , @xmath179 , just as observed .",
    "we have analysed a birth - death model with overlapping generations , in order to study several statistical properties of monoparental inheritance in large populations .",
    "we have focused the analysis on a cultural trait , namely , the distribution of surnames , taking advantage of the availability of big corpora of real data .",
    "however , the model applies generally to biological traits associated with non recombining alleles .",
    "our model has two parameters , namely , the probability that a new individual carries a surname not present in the population , @xmath15 , and the average number of death events per birth @xmath16 . for any value of @xmath180 the system attains a broad , stationary distribution of surname diversity . if @xmath104 the total population grows exponentially in time and so does the total number of different surnames .",
    "the marginal case @xmath95 corresponds to constant total population and , on average , to constant surname diversity for asymptotically large times .",
    "our analytical results for the stationary distribution of surnames frequency are in good agreement with field data for modern human populations in different countries . through an analysis of the transient time required for this distribution to reach its asymptotic shape ,",
    "we have shown that some deviations observed in real data might actually reflect the composition of the founder population .",
    "this result has implications in the study of polyphyletism .",
    "indeed , if the same surname can have multiple origins and thus the individuals carrying it are not always phylogenetically related , this will affect the shape of the surname distribution .",
    "in particular , it is not difficult to estimate the time when surnames originated in a population ( using historical records ) or , in the biological counterpart , when a mutant allele first appeared ( through molecular clock analysis ) .",
    "then , the approximate cut - off until which the stationary distribution follows the asymptotic shape can be calculated .",
    "if the distribution underestimates the frequency of values larger than the cut - off , the system is mainly polyphyletic .",
    "if it overestimates that frequency , then the simultaneous appearance of many individual carrying different surnames took place in the past .",
    "the strong resemblance between the cultural inheritance of the surname and the biological process in which non recombining neutral alleles are passed to offspring has justified to apply results from field data in the former case to the latter ( barrai _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "in the few cases where data on genetic diversity was available , it was possible to retrieve information on past populations by comparing both sets of data ( sykes & irven , 2000 ) .",
    "a specific example comes from the small island of tristan da cunha , where the fact that its @xmath181 inhabitants represent only seven surnames and five mitochondrial lineages reflects without doubt the small size of the founder population ( soodyall _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) .",
    "our results could be applied to population genetics under some hypotheses .",
    "indeed , we are assuming that the number of different alleles at a given locus is practically infinite ( this is analogous to the assumption made by kimura & crow ( 1964 ) , in their model of infinitely many alleles ) , since the possibility of backward mutations is discarded .",
    "nonetheless , this factor could be accounted for just by lowering the value of @xmath15 , because this process implies that the `` new '' mutant is in fact identical to one of the forms present in the population .",
    "since , as long as @xmath15 is small , our results are not sensibly modified , we could also work with a finite but large number @xmath182 of different surnames ( equivalently , large genetic polymorphism ) , and use the same model as long as the current diversity is lower than @xmath182 .",
    "we have also assumed that the death rate is constant during the life time of individuals , while it is known that the life expectancy depends not only on the age of individuals , but also varies as a function of time ( vaupel _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) . a more realistic model of human inheritance",
    "could be constructed by taking into account the variation of @xmath16 along the lifetime of each individual .",
    "the evolution of surname diversity follows truly neutral evolution : family names do not fulfill any practical purpose but identifying the lineage of each individual . they can not be selected for through natural selection .",
    "hence , as we have shown , their statistical distribution closely follows the predictions of a neutral model of monoparental inheritance",
    ". it would be interesting to test our theoretical results against the genetic diversity of a large population sample .",
    "unfortunately , however , data on frequencies of allelic polymorphisms are still scarce to carry out a massive study like the one presented here for actual surname distributions .",
    "moreover , one should make sure that the different haplotypes in the sample do not confer any advantage to the individuals , in which case positive feedbacks and deviations from neutral statistics would be expected .",
    "different tests have been proposed in the literature to detect deviations from neutrality ( nielsen , 2001 ; fu & li , 1993 ) , and a number of neutral haplotypes have been positively identified ( snchez mazas _",
    "et al . _ , 1994 ; stenoien , 1999 ) .",
    "hopefully , enough data will be available in a near future to calculate reliable diversity distributions in human populations .",

    "as explained in the main text , at each step , the total population @xmath18 in our model either increases by @xmath183 with probability @xmath184 , due to the occurrence of a birth event and no death event , or remains constant with probability @xmath16 , due to the occurrence of both a birth and a death event .",
    "equations ( [ pest ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) quantify the corresponding stochastic process .    since the total population changes during the evolution , the time interval @xmath185 to be associated with each step which corresponds to the interval between consecutive births must also change .",
    "in fact , the birth frequency is proportional to the total population , so that @xmath185 is inversely proportional to @xmath186 .",
    "we write , at step @xmath17 , @xmath187 where the frequency @xmath24 fixes time units .    in consequence ,",
    "the real - time average variation in @xmath18 can be obtained from @xmath188 } = \\nu { \\overline}{[1-w(s)]p(s ) } = \\nu ( 1-\\mu ) { \\overline}p , \\ ] ] where overlines indicate average over realizations of the stochastic process @xmath20 . to obtain this average evolution equation",
    "we have used eqn ( [ pest ] ) , and have taken into account that @xmath20 and @xmath18 are independent stochastic processes at each step @xmath17 , so that @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath24 is identified with the birth rate per individual and unit time , the product @xmath190 is the mortality rate . for constant @xmath24 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the solution to eqn ( [ a1 ] ) is @xmath191,\\ ] ] with @xmath192 the initial population .",
    "under the action of both birth and death events , the evolution of the average number of families of size @xmath38 , @xmath193 , is given by eqns ( [ simon2i ] ) and ( [ simonm ] ) .",
    "these equations can be approximately solved assuming that the solution varies slowly on @xmath17 and @xmath38 , so that these two discrete variables admit replacement by continuous variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath49 is replaced by a continuous function @xmath70 .",
    "the approximation is based on the expansions @xmath194 and @xmath195 , to be introduced in eqns ( [ simon2i ] ) and ( [ simonm ] ) at different truncation orders .      to the first order",
    ", we obtain the differential equation @xmath196 for @xmath197 . the contribution for @xmath198 , given by eqn ( [ simon3i ] ) , can be incorporated to ( [ e1 ] ) either as a boundary condition or as a singular inhomogeneity in the equation itself .",
    "the latter yields @xmath199 where @xmath200 stands for the dirac delta distribution . in the following , we obtain and analyse the solution to this equation .    introducing the auxiliary variables @xmath201",
    "eqn ( [ e2 ] ) becomes @xmath202 with @xmath203 .",
    "this is a one - dimensional wave equation , with `` spatial '' variable @xmath204 and `` temporal '' variable @xmath205 .",
    "it describes shape - preserving advection of the `` density '' @xmath206 with constant velocity @xmath207 , subject to the action of a point source of intensity @xmath208 at @xmath209 . in our problem , thus , this equation makes sense for @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) since @xmath204 must be non - negative ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "the general solution for @xmath213 is given by an arbitrary combination of functions of the form @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is in principle arbitrary .",
    "the combination must be chosen in such a way that the boundary and initial conditions are satisfied . in our case , this is achieved with a combination of two such functions . in the original variables , the solution is given piecewise as @xmath216 for @xmath72 , and @xmath217 for @xmath74 . here , @xmath218 is the initial distribution .",
    "the transition point between the two pieces is located at @xmath219 these expressions give the first - order continuous approximation @xmath220 to the distribution of families by size .",
    "the average total number of surnames in the continuous approximation is defined in ( [ avnc ] ) .",
    "for the first - order approximation we find @xmath221 the last integral is clearly equal to the initial number of surnames , @xmath59 , as may be immediately realized by the change of variables @xmath222 .",
    "explicit calculation of the first integral shows that @xmath223 , i.e. exactly the same result as for the case of @xmath27 , eqn ( [ ns ] ) . as a function of time",

    "comparison with eqns ( [ ni ] ) and ( [ sol1 ] ) suggests that this particular solution will correspond to the long - time asymptotic evolution .",
