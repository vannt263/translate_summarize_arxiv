    "quantification of the health effects of air pollution is an important statistical modelling problem that is of considerable public interest , and public health agencies and government departments are required to estimate both its financial and health impact .",
    "for example , in the uk the department for the environment , food and rural affairs ( defra ) estimate that _",
    "`` in 2008 air pollution in the form of anthropogenic particulate matter ( pm ) alone was estimated to reduce average life expectancy in the uk by six months . thereby imposing an estimated equivalent health cost of @xmath0 billion '' _ , ( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimated effects are based on evidence from a large number of epidemiological studies , which have quantified the impact of both short - term and long - term exposure to air pollution .",
    "the effects of long - term exposure are typically estimated from individual - level cohort studies such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but they are both expensive and time consuming to implement . therefore , recent increases in the availability of small - area statistics has allowed these effects to be estimated using an ecological small - area design , with prominent examples being @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while these studies can not assess the causal health effects of air pollution due to their ecological design , they are quick and cheap to implement , and they contribute to , and independently corroborate , the body of evidence about the long - term population level impact of air pollution .",
    "+ the ecological design uses a geographical association study , where the study region of interest is partitioned into a set of non - overlapping areal units , such as counties , districts or postal codes .",
    "the number of disease cases arising from the population living in each areal unit is modelled , using poisson regression , with a number of risk factors including average air pollution concentrations , measures of socio - economic deprivation and demography .",
    "geographical ( equivalently spatial ) association is introduced into the model by means of a spatially correlated random effect for each areal unit .",
    "these random effects model any residual spatial correlation that may be present in the disease data after the covariate effects have been removed , which may be caused by unmeasured confounding , neighbourhood effects ( where individual areal unit s behaviour is influenced by that of neighbouring units ) and grouping effects ( where individual units seem to be close to similar units ) .",
    "these random effects , usually not of direct interest , are assigned a conditional autoregressive ( car , @xcite ) prior as part of a hierarchical bayesian model , for example see @xcite .",
    "+ the car model for spatial association tends to be globally smooth , and has only recently been shown ( for example see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) to be potentially collinear with any covariate in the model which is also globally smooth , such as average air pollution concentrations .",
    "such collinearity leads to poor estimation performance for the fixed effects ( @xcite ) , both in terms of the estimates and their associated levels of uncertainty .",
    "in addition , this collinearity suggests that the residual spatial correlation is unlikely to be globally spatially smooth , as that component of the spatial variation in the disease data will have been accounted for by the air pollution covariate .",
    "instead , the residual spatial correlation can be strong in some areas showing smoothness , and can be weak in some other areas exhibiting abrupt step changes .",
    "the existing car models force the random effects to exhibit a single global level of spatial smoothness determined by geographical adjacency , and are not flexible enough to capture the complex localised structure likely to be present in the residual spatial correlation . +",
    "the lack of flexibility in existing car models and the collinearity problems highlighted by @xcite and others has motivated us to develop a new _ localised conditional autoregressive _ ( lcar ) prior for modelling residual spatial correlation , which is presented in section  [ sn : method ] . to contain the required flexibility",
    "the lcar prior captures localised residual spatial correlation by allowing random effects in geographically adjacent areas to be correlated or conditionally independent , and we show that this prior distribution can have realisations at both spatial smoothing extremes , namely global smoothness and independence .",
    "this flexibility leads to a large increase in the computational burden and a lack of parsimony causing problems of parameter identifiability , and a critique of the limitations of the existing literature in this area is given in section 2 .",
    "+ here we solve these problems with a novel prior elicitation method based on historical data , which is similar in spirit to power priors ( see @xcite ) . our elicitation is based on an approximate gaussian likelihood , and produces a set of candidate correlation structures for the residual spatial correlation .",
    "the lcar prior thus combines a discrete uniform distribution on this set of candidate structures with a modified car prior for the random effects , which combined with the poisson likelihood completes a full bayesian hierarchical model .",
    "inference is obtained using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods , and the model allows us to simultaneously estimate the random effects , their local spatial structure as well as the fixed effects .",
    "we conduct a large simulation study in section  [ sn : simul ] to show improved parameter estimation and model fitting when using the proposed lcar prior distribution .",
    "the improvement , measured by the root mean square error ( rmse ) , is seen to be large for the fixed effects and somewhat substantial for model fitting .",
    "we follow up this investigation by analysing the motivating data set for the city of glasgow in section  [ sn : example ] .",
    "but , first we present the motivating data set and discuss the background modelling and prior distributions in section  [ sn : background ] .",
    "the study region is the health board comprising the city of glasgow and the river clyde estuary , which in 2010 contained just under 1.2 million people .",
    "the region is partitioned into @xmath1 administrative units called intermediate geographies ( ig ) , which contain just over 4,000 people on average .",
    "the data used in this study are freely available , and can be downloaded from the scottish neighbourhood statistics ( sns ) database ( _ http://www.sns.gov.uk_ ) . the response variable is the numbers of admissions to non - psychiatric and non - obstetric hospitals in each ig in 2010 with a primary diagnosis of respiratory disease , which corresponds to codes j00-j99 and r09.1 of the international classification of disease tenth revision .",
    "differences in the size and demographic structure of the populations living in each ig are accounted for by computing the expected numbers of hospital admissions using external standardisation , based on age and sex specific respiratory disease rates for the whole study region .",
    "an exploratory estimate of disease risk is given by the standardised incidence ratio ( sir ) , which is the ratio of the observed to the expected numbers of admissions .",
    "it is displayed in the top panel of figure [ figure data1 ] , and shows that the risks are highest in the heavily deprived east end of glasgow ( east of the study region ) as well as along the southern bank of the river clyde , the latter of which flows into the sea in the west and runs south east through the study region .",
    "+ ambient air pollution concentrations are measured at a network of locations across scotland , details of which are available at _ http://www.scottishairquality.co.uk/_. however , the network is not dense at the small - area scale required by this study , so instead we make use of modelled yearly average concentrations at a resolution of 1 kilometre grid squares provided by the defra ( see _ http://laqm.defra.gov.uk/maps/_ ) .",
    "we use concentrations for 2009 in this study rather than 2010 , because it ensures that the air pollution exposure occurred before the hospital admissions due to respiratory illnesses .",
    "these modelled concentrations were computed using dispersion models and were then calibrated against the available monitoring data , and further details are available from @xcite .",
    "they were subsequently converted to the intermediate geography scale by computing the median value within each ig .",
    "concentrations ( in @xmath2 ) of nitrogen dioxide ( no@xmath3 ) and particulate matter are available for this study , the latter being measured as both pm@xmath4 ( particles less than 10@xmath5 in diameter ) and pm@xmath6 ( particles less than 2.5@xmath5 in diameter ) .",
    "the pm@xmath4 data are displayed in the bottom panel of figure [ figure data1 ] , which shows the highest concentrations are in the centre of the city of glasgow as expected .",
    "+ a number of other covariates were considered in this study , the most important of which is a measure of socio - economic deprivation .",
    "the relationship between deprivation and ill health is well known ( for example see @xcite ) , and in this study we use the percentage of people living in each ig in 2009 who are defined to be income deprived , which means they are in receipt of a combination of means tested benefits .",
    "other variables we also consider are measures of ethnicity ( the percentage of school children in each ig who are non - white ) , access to alternative forms of health care ( the average time taken to drive to a doctor s surgery ) and a measure of urbanicity ( a factor variable with 6 levels , with level one defined as urban and level six as rural ) .",

    "@xmath16 denotes the vector of covariate effects , while @xmath17 represents disease risk in areal unit @xmath18 .",
    "a value of @xmath17 greater ( less ) than one indicates that areal unit @xmath18 has a higher ( lower ) than average disease risk , and in terms of interpretation , @xmath19 corresponds to a 15@xmath20 increased risk of disease .",
    "as previously discussed the random effects @xmath21 capture any residual spatial correlation present in the disease data , and are typically assigned a conditional autoregressive prior , which is a special case of a gaussian markov random field ( gmrf ) .",
    "such models are typically specified as a set of @xmath7 univariate full conditional distributions , that is as @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "however , the markov nature of these models means that the conditioning is only on the random effects in geographically adjacent areal units , which induces spatial correlation into @xmath25 .",
    "the adjacency information comes from a binary @xmath26 neighbourhood matrix @xmath27 , where @xmath28 equals one if areal units @xmath29 share a common border ( denoted @xmath30 ) and is zero otherwise ( denoted @xmath31 ) .",
    "the intrinsic model ( @xcite , iar ) is the simplest prior in the car class , and its full conditional distributions are given by    @xmath32    the conditional expectation is the mean of the random effects in neighbouring areas , while the conditional variance is inversely proportional to the number of neighbours .",
    "the joint multivariate gaussian distribution for @xmath25 corresponding to ( [ equation iar ] ) has a mean of zero but a singular precision matrix @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is an @xmath7 dimensional vector of ones .",
    "this prior is appropriate if the residuals from the covariate component of the model , that is @xmath36 , are spatially smooth across the entire region , because the partial correlation between @xmath37 conditional on the remaining random effects ( denoted @xmath38 ) is    @xmath39}}~=~\\frac{w_{kj}}{\\sqrt{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{ki})(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{ji})}}\\label{equation partialcorrelation}.\\ ] ]    equation ( [ equation partialcorrelation ] ) shows that all pairs of random effects relating to geographically adjacent areal units are partially correlated ( @xmath40 ) , which smoothes the random effects across geographical borders .",
    "the most common extension to the iar model to allow for varying levels of spatial smoothness is the bym or convolution model ( @xcite ) , which augments the linear predictor in ( [ equation likelihood ] ) with a second set of independent gaussian random effects with a mean of zero and a constant variance .",
    "further alternatives have been proposed by @xcite and @xcite , but all of these extensions have a single spatial correlation parameter ( for the bym model it is the ratio of the two random effects variances ) that controls the level of spatial smoothing globally across the entire region .",
    "thus these models are inappropriate for capturing the likely localised nature of the residual spatial correlation , which may contain sub - region of spatial smoothness separated by step changes .",
    "+ a small number of papers have extended the class of car priors to account for localised spatial smoothing , the majority of which have treated @xmath41 as a set of binary random quantities , rather than forcing them to equal one .",
    "the neighbourhood matrix is always assumed to be symmetric so that changing @xmath42 also changes @xmath43 , while the other elements in @xmath27 relating to non - neighbouring areal units remain fixed at zero .",
    "equation ( [ equation partialcorrelation ] ) shows that this allows @xmath44 corresponding to adjacent areal units to be conditionally independent or correlated , and if @xmath42 ( and hence @xmath43 ) is estimated as zero a boundary is said to exist between the two random effects .",
    "one of the first models in this vein was developed by @xcite , who proposed a logistic regression model for the elements in @xmath45 , where the covariate was a non - negative measure of the dissimilarity between areal units @xmath46 .",
    "similar approaches were proposed by @xcite and @xcite , who replace logistic regression with a second stage car prior and an ising model respectively . however",
    ", these approaches introduce a large number of covariance parameters into the model , which for the glasgow data considered here has @xmath47 data points and @xmath48 spatial correlation parameters . therefore , full estimation of @xmath45 as a set of separate unknown parameters results in a highly overparameterised covariance model for @xmath25 , and @xcite suggest that the individual elements are poorly identified from the data and are computationally expensive to update . + a related approach was proposed by @xcite , who deterministically model the elements of @xmath45 as a function of measures of dissimilarity and a small number of parameters , rather than modelling each element as a separate random variable .",
    "however , their approach is designed for the related fields of disease mapping and wombling ( @xcite ) , whose aims are not , as they are here , to estimate the effects of an exposure on a response .",
    "an alternative approach was suggested by @xcite , who propose an iterative algorithm in which @xmath45 is updated deterministically based on the joint posterior distribution of the remaining model parameters",
    ". however , their algorithm has the drawback that only an estimate of each @xmath42 is provided , rather than the posterior probability that @xmath40 .",
    "our methodological approach follows the literature critiqued above , and treats the elements in @xmath45 relating to contiguous areal units as a set of binary random quantities . as",
    "conditional autoregressive priors are a special case of an undirected graphical model ( @xcite ) , we follow the terminology in that literature and refer to @xmath45 as the set of _ edges _ , and further define any edge @xmath49 that is estimated as zero as being removed .",
    "our methodological innovation is a _ localised conditional autoregressive ( lcar ) _ prior , which comprises a joint distribution for an extended set of random effects @xmath50 and the set of edges @xmath45 , rather than the traditional approach of assuming the latter is fixed .",
    "we decompose this joint prior distribution as @xmath51 , and the next three sub - sections describe its two components as well as the overall hierarchical model .",
    "the iar prior given by ( [ equation iar ] ) is an inappropriate model for @xmath25 in the context of treating @xmath45 as random , because of the possibility that all of the edges for a single areal unit could be removed . in this case",
    "@xmath53 for some @xmath54 , resulting in ( [ equation iar ] ) having an infinite mean and variance .",
    "therefore we consider an extended vector of random effects @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a global random effect that is potentially common to all areal units and prevents any unit from having no edges . the extended @xmath57 dimensional neighbourhood matrix corresponding to @xmath50",

    "the requirement for @xmath69 to be invertible comes from the need to calculate its determinant when updating @xmath45 , a difficulty not faced when implementing model ( [ equation iar ] ) because @xmath45 and @xmath70 are fixed .",
    "the addition of @xmath68 to the diagonal of the precision matrix has been suggested in this context by @xcite .",
    "the full conditional distributions corresponding to the lcar model are given by :    @xmath71    in ( [ equation fc1 ] ) the conditional expectation is a weighted average of the global random effect @xmath56 and the random effects in neighbouring areas , with the binary weights depending on the current value of @xmath45 .",
    "the conditional variance is approximately ( due to @xmath68 ) inversely proportional to the number of edges remaining in the model , including the edge to the global random effect @xmath56 . removing the @xmath72th edge from @xmath45 sets @xmath42 ( and hence @xmath43 ) equal to zero and makes @xmath37 conditionally independent , and means that the global random effect @xmath56 is included in the conditional expectation to allow for non - spatial smoothing . in the extreme case of all edges being retained in the model ( [ equation fc1 ] ) simplifies to the iar model for global spatial smoothing , while if all edges are removed the random effects are independent with mean and variance approximately ( again due to @xmath68 ) equal to @xmath56 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the dimensionality of @xmath45 is @xmath75 , and as each edge is binary the sample space has size @xmath76 . the simplest approach would be to assign each edge an independent bernoulli prior , but as described in section two this is likely to result in @xmath45 being weakly identifiable .",
    "therefore we treat @xmath45 as a single random quantity , and propose the following discrete uniform prior for its neighbourhood matrix representation @xmath77 ;    @xmath78    the last candidate value @xmath79 retains all @xmath80 edges in the model , that is @xmath81 , and corresponds to the iar model for global spatial smoothing .",
    "moving from @xmath82 to @xmath83 removes an edge from @xmath45 , which sets one additional @xmath84 .",
    "this means that @xmath85 contains no edges and corresponds to independent random effects .",
    "thus the set @xmath86 corresponds to localised spatial smoothing , where some edges are present in the model and the corresponding random effects are smoothed , while other edges are absent and no such smoothing is enforced .",
    "this restriction reduces the sample space of @xmath45 to being one - dimensional , because the possible values @xmath87 have a natural ordering in terms of the number of edges present in the model .",
    "+ we propose eliciting the set of candidate values @xmath87 from disease data prior to the study period , because such data are typically available and should have a similar spatial structure to the response .",

    "the results for the bym model are always between these two extremes , which is unsurprising because while it can represent different levels of spatial smoothness , it effectively has a single parameter ( the ratio of the two random effect variances ) that controls the level of smoothing globally rather than locally as is required here .",

    "the results are displayed in table [ table application ] , which quantifies the overall goodness of fit of the models and the estimated covariate effects .",
    "the results described in this section relate to models where pm@xmath4 was the pollution metric , but the results for the other pollutants are similar .",
    "the goodness - of - fit of each model is summarised by its deviance information criterion ( dic , @xcite ) , where a smaller value represents a better fitting model .",
    "the table shows that the lcar model is the best fit to the data according to the dic , with a value that is lower by 22.5 and 5.7 compared with the iar and bym models respectively .",
    "the presence of residual spatial correlation was then assessed using a two - sided moran s i permutation test ( based on 10,000 random permutations ) , and neither the lcar nor the bym models exhibited any remaining spatial structure .",
    "in contrast , the residuals from the iar model exhibited substantial negative correlation , which is likely to be because the residual spatial structure from a covariate only model is rougher than the spatially smooth random effects model",
    ". therefore , as the residuals from the iar model are essentially the difference between these two spatial surfaces , they are likely to have different signs in neighbouring areas , resulting in negative spatial correlation .",
    "table [ table application ] also displays the estimated relationships between each covariate and the response , where all results are presented as relative risks for an increase of one standard deviation in each covariates value .",
    "the table shows that both particulate matter metrics exhibit substantial effects on respiratory disease risk , as apart from the iar model , the worst performing model in terms of fixed effects estimation in the simulation study , the 95@xmath20 credible intervals do not contain the null risk of one .",
    "the estimated relative risks for pm@xmath4 across all three models range between 1.037 and 1.048 for a 1.5@xmath2 increase in the yearly average concentration , while the corresponding risks for pm@xmath6 range between 1.033 and 1.043 for a 1.1@xmath2 increase .",
    "the lower ends of the credible intervals for no@xmath3 for all three models lie on the borderline of the null risk of one , with the iar and bym intervals including the null value while the interval for the lcar model does not .",
    "the table also shows that income deprivation has a substantial effect on the response , with a 12.9@xmath20 increase being associated with between a 32@xmath20 and a 35@xmath20 increased risk of respiratory disease .",
    "consistent attenuation of the estimated covariate effects are observed for the iar model compared with the other models , while the estimates from the bym model are also consistently slightly lower than those from the lcar model .",
    ".a summary of the overall fit of each model ( top panel ) and the estimated covariate effects ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the former includes the dic and a permutation test for residual spatial correlation using moran s i statistic .",
    "the latter are presented as relative risks for a one - standard deviation increase in each covariates value ( in brackets ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]      figure [ figure w ] displays the posterior density for the number of edges removed from the model , where the three grey lines are chain specific estimates while the bold black line represents the combined density from all three markov chains .",
    "the figure shows close agreement between the chains , as all three give similar density estimates .",
    "there are 718 edges in total in the greater glasgow region , and the middle 95@xmath20 of the posterior distribution lies between 210 and 473 of these having been removed .",
    "the figure suggests that while the posterior variability is relatively wide , there is information in the data to estimate the number of edges to remove .",
    "specifically , the posterior distribution is multi - modal , with the two largest modes occurring when 245 and 375 edges are removed .",
    "the figure also provides strong evidence that the random effects are neither globally spatially smooth not independent , as there is no posterior mass at either end of the range of possible values ( 0 or 718 edges removed ) .",
    "this paper has proposed a new localised conditional autoregressive ( lcar ) prior for modelling residual spatial correlation , which is flexible enough to capture either spatial smoothness or a distinct step change in the data between adjacent areal units .",
    "this flexibility is due to the treatment of the neighbourhood matrix @xmath27 as a random quantity to be estimated in the model , rather than assuming it is fixed based on geographical adjacency .",
    "however , this approach requires a large number of covariance parameters to be estimated , and the resulting lack of parsimony is overcome by using prior information to greatly reduce the size and dimensionality of the sample space for @xmath27 .",
    "the proposed model can estimate a range of localised spatial correlation structures , as well as patterns that are globally smooth or independent in space .",
    "+ the simulation study has shown that the increased flexibility of the lcar model results in superior estimation performance in a root measure error sense for both fixed effects and fitted values , when compared with the commonly used global smoothing alternatives .",
    "this improvement in estimation is most prominent for covariate effects , where the percentage reductions in rmse ranged between 4.5@xmath20 and 45.8@xmath20 in the study presented in section four .",
    "the resulting conclusion to be drawn is that inappropriate control for residual spatial correlation can greatly retard fixed effects estimation , meaning that its careful modelling is vital even if it is not itself of direct interest . +",
    "the epidemiological study presented in this paper shows substantial evidence that particulate air pollution is harmful to respiratory health in greater glasgow , with an estimated increase in the population s disease burden of around 4@xmath20 if yearly average concentrations increased by between 1.1 and 1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "however , one must remember that this is an observational ecological study design , and the results must not be interpreted in terms of individual level cause and effect ( ecological bias ) .",
    "even so , as small - area studies are cheaper and quicker to implement than individual level cohort studies , they form an important component of the evidence base quantifying the health effects of long - term exposure to air pollution .",
    "+ there are many avenues for future work in this area , including the extension of the methodology to the spatio - temporal domain . in an epidemiological context",
    "the extension of the present study to the whole of the united kingdom would be of interest to policymakers , as it would give the uk government a national rather than a regional picture of the extent of the air pollution problem .",
    "in addition , while the motivation for this paper was an ecological regression problem , the methodology developed will also be directly relevant to the fields of disease mapping ( see for example @xcite ) and wombling ( @xcite ) , whose aims are to estimate the spatial pattern in disease risk and to identify any boundaries in the estimated risk surface . +",
