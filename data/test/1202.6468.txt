    "the continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite present sufficiently wide and general class of random walks , describing random motions of particles , when both the waiting ( sojourn ) time between successive jumps and the jump length ( including its direction ) are generally coupled random variables .",
    "the ctrws have been widely applied in building up models of anomalous diffusion and transport in physics @xcite ( to name a few ) and biology @xcite , and in economical problems @xcite .    in their original form",
    "@xcite the ctrws describe random walks , or , more precisely , jumps , on lattices when only the waiting time is a random variable . in the general case of the uncoupled ctrws both waiting time and jump length",
    "are independent random variables , this leads to the jump model of the ctrws .",
    "the kinetic model of random walks , often called random flights , originates from the pearson  rayleigh random walks @xcite . in this model",
    "the particle moves with constant velocity for a random time along straight lines between points where it changes randomly the direction of movement .",
    "the random flights can be considered both in the framework of the generalized linear transport ( kinetic ) equation @xcite and in the framework of the ctrws , when the waiting time and jump length are coupled random variables .",
    "the latter is the velocity or velocity - jump model of the ctrws @xcite .",
    "the jump model of the ctrws has gained high popularity due to its greater simplicity than the kinetic ( velocity - jump ) model . however , in the jump model the waiting time can generally be arbitrarily small or / and the jump length can be arbitrary long ( levy flights ) , and , therefore , a walking particle can move with infinite velocity .",
    "thus , the jump model may , in contrast to the kinetic one , violate the principle of causality .",
    "this is similar to the classic _ diffusion paradox _",
    "@xcite related to the conventional diffusion equation , which is widely used for approximate macroscopic description of nonanomalous diffusion and brownian motion .",
    "the difference is that in classic einstein s model of brownian motion @xcite , leading to the diffusion equation , the particle moves with finite velocity .",
    "in fact einstein s model is nothing but the symmetric bernoulli random walk @xcite , which can be considered as a degenerate case of the ctrws in the frameworks of both the jump and kinetic models .",
    "the telegraph equation @xcite was proposed as an alternative to the diffusion equation .",
    "in contrast to the latter , which is parabolic , the telegraph equation is hyperbolic , providing the finite speed of signal propagation .",
    "two- and three - dimensional telegraph equations meet some formal problems since green s functions can become negative @xcite .",
    "though in the case of thermal conduction this can be fixed by imposing restrictions on the heat flux @xcite .",
    "yet the one - dimensional telegraph equation avoids the diffusion paradox and provides better model for nonanomalous diffusion than the one - dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors discussed microscopic models of the telegraph equation . aside from the kinetic model they proposed another model based on uncoupled ctrws with the waiting time distributed according to the gamma law @xmath1 and the jump length having the finite second moment .",
    "the authors called the ctrws with the gamma - distributed waiting time delayed ctrws ( dctrws ) .",
    "similar arguments were used in ref.@xcite when deriving the telegraph equation with reaction . in ref.@xcite the telegraph equation with reaction was derived formally from the ctrw with exponentially distributed waiting time , and later , in ref.@xcite ,  from the ctrw with a general waiting time .",
    "earlier , the telegraph equation was derived in ref.@xcite from uncoupled ctrws with the waiting time having more general distribution than the gamma law .",
    "we call these ctrws for brevity also delayed ctrws ( dctrws ) .",
    "the conclusions that the dctrws simulates the telegraph equation at the microscopic level are strange .",
    "indeed , the telegraph equation describes phenomena with finite propagation speed , while the particle in the dctrws may move with infinite velocity , i.e. , the dctrws do not reflect the principal peculiarity of the telegraph equation . in spite of this discrepancy",
    ", one may believe that the telegraph equation still gives a precise approximation to the dctrws .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how accurate are the approximations to the dctrws provided by the telegraph equation .",
    "we show that the diffusion equation , being the correct limit of the dctrws , gives better approximations to the dctrws than the telegraph equation .",
    "one can conclude , therefore , that the dctrws can not be a model for the telegraph equation at microscopic level .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ctrw ] we recall some facts concerning the uncoupled ctrws . section  [ sec : teleapprox ] shows how the telegraph equation was derived from the dctrws in ref.@xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the dctrws is discussed in section  [ sec : asymptbehav ] . in section  [ sec : numercompar ]",
    "we compare the telegraph and diffusion approximations to two ( discrete- and continuous - space ) dctrws , completely described in section  [ sec : twoparticul ] , numerically , while asymptotic comparison of the approximations to the continuous - space dctrw at long times is performed in section  [ sec : asymptcompar ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains some conclusive remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly formulate some facts concerning the ctrws for further reference .",
    "we adopt the one - dimensional model and consider uncoupled ctrws , when the waiting time and jump length are independent random variables , i.e. , the joint probability density @xmath2 for a particle to jump a distance @xmath3 after waiting a time @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are probability densities for the waiting time and jump length , respectively , with obvious normalizations @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "it is necessary to note here that the explanation , given in ref.@xcite , does not allow us to judge whether the telegraph equation approximates the random walk better than the diffusion equation in a wide time interval ? to check this conclusion",
    "we have performed calculations , in which the binomial distribution , being the distribution of the walking particle , was evaluated through the first two terms of stirling s asymptotic series for the gamma function @xcite @xmath116 $ ] as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , which is more accurate than conventional stirling s formula .",
    "these calculations have confirmed the conclusion up to time @xmath121 , which seems to be asymptotic .",
    "obviously , the solutions of both the diffusion equation and the telegraph one do not approximate the binomial distribution at short time .",
    "the reason , by which the solution of the telegraph equation approximates the bernoulli random walk better than that of the diffusion equation , seems to be clear : the bernoulli particle moves with finite velocity . however , the probability density for the waiting time @xmath122 , eq .",

    "thus , in spite of the diffusion asymptotic behaviour for the dctrws and the infinite speed of the motion of the particle , the question still remains : which of the telegraph or the diffusion equations gives better approximation to the dctrws ?",
    "to compare the telegraph and diffusion equations with the dctrws we consider two particular dctrws .",
