    "the theory of high - temperature superconductivity remains one of the most challenging problems in solid - state physics . in many metallic compounds , over a broad range of compositions and temperatures ,",
    "only two phases are encountered , i.e.  the normal ( fermi liquid ) and a magnetic or superconducting phase . in sharp contrast , the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) and other strongly correlated electron systems , such as heavy - fermion and a variety of transition - metal oxide systems , exhibit many ordered phases , which appear to compete and sometimes coexist.@xcite in the htsc , besides ordered antiferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) phases , compelling evidence exists for charge- and spin-``stripe '' phases and phases with coexisting sc and af order.@xcite the common denominator and the underlying reason for these competing orders is certainly the presence of strong electronic correlations and mott - hubbard physics : the interplay between kinetic - energy and coulomb - correlation effects induces an extreme sensitivity to external parameters ( doping , temperature , pressure , etc . ) and a rather difficult to predict `` outcome '' , i.e.  the characteristic low - energy excitations and the phase diagram at low temperatures .",
    "the central challenge in the field of high-@xmath1 superconductivity is , therefore , the connection of the ( known ) microscopic interactions at the level of electrons and ions , which are at high energy ( @xmath2ev ) and temperature @xmath3 , with the `` emerging phenomena '' at @xmath4 , i.e.  competing and nearly degenerate orders .",
    "ideally , one should employ a systematic renormalization - group approach to integrate out the irrelevant degrees of freedom and , thereby , correctly bridge high to low energies and eventually go to @xmath4 .",
    "it is , however , by no means obvious how to do this when strong correlations are present , such as in the htsc .    in this context cluster techniques , which systematically approach the infinite - size ( low - energy ) limit ,",
    "provide a powerful alternative .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we will discuss and apply a variational - cluster approach ( vca ) which was proposed recently .",
    "@xcite it is based on the self - energy - functional theory ( sft ) , @xcite which provides a general variational scheme to use dynamical information from an exactly solvable `` reference system '' ( in our case , an isolated cluster ) to go to the infinite - size lattice fermion problem at low temperatures and at @xmath4 , in particular . in our earlier work @xcite this scheme",
    "was formulated to study phases with spontaneously broken symmetry . for the cluster sizes used",
    ", it was shown that the vca correctly reproduces long - range af order for the two - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) hubbard model and the absence of this order in one dimension .",
    "this non - trivial `` test '' implies that the vca goes well beyond ordinary mean - field theory .",
    "another crucial test is provided by the dynamical information contained in the one - particle green s function @xmath6 .",
    "compared to variational schemes based on wave functions , @xcite an important advantage of the vca consists in the fact that it quite naturally gives the one - electron green s function @xmath6 . for the @xmath5 hubbard model ,",
    "it was recently demonstrated @xcite that the vca , with the lattice tiled by ( @xmath7 ) clusters , correctly reproduces low - temperature quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) data , in particular , the coherent and incoherent `` bands '' experimentally known from arpes data .",
    "@xcite    these tests provide also the foundation for attacking the question whether the `` minimal '' microscopic model , namely the @xmath5 one - band hubbard model , reproduces the essential features of the electron- and hole - doped htsc phase diagram .",
    "we will not go into a lengthy discussion of what interactions should be retained at the electron - ion level .",
    "but , when choosing the @xmath5 one - band hubbard model , @xcite i.e.@xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the usual annihilation and creation operators , @xmath11 denote the hopping - matrix elements , @xmath12 the density at site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 and @xmath15 the local coulomb repulsion , one has introduced gross simplifications , leaving out other orbital ( e.g.  @xmath16 ) degrees of freedom , long - range coulomb interaction , electron - phonon coupling , etc . nevertheless , this choice appears to be legitimate , last not least in view of the amazing agreement achieved between numerical simulations and experimental results for the normal - state properties of the cuprates ( see , for example , refs .  ) .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of the model was recently investigated using the vca by snchal et al .",
    "@xcite and by two of us .",
    "@xcite there are important technical differences , but the `` upshot '' of the two works is as follows : for the cluster sizes used in the vca , the @xmath4 phase diagram of the hubbard model ( including hopping terms up to second or third - nearest neighbors ) turns out to be qualitatively similar to that of the electron- and hole - doped cuprates .",
    "the model correctly describes the overall phase diagram , such as the occurrence of the af and sc phases and predicts the corresponding doping ranges in qualitative agreement with the experiments for the cuprate materials .",
    "the present paper has several purposes : first , we would like to stress that for an application of the vca to the high-@xmath1 problem it is of crucial importance to treat the on - site energies in the reference system as variational parameters .",
    "we will show that this ensures a thermodynamically consistent determination of the average particle number .",
    "compared to the study of ref .",
    "this represents an important methodical extension . on the other hand , without the variational optimization of the on - site energy , one has to tolerate an inconsistency in the determination of the average particle number .",
    "the effects of this error shall be demonstrated by model calculations .",
    "the issue of thermodynamic consistency is also discussed for the off - diagonal elements of the one - particle density matrix and , in case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , for the respective order parameter .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are no such problems in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and its cluster extensions .",
    "@xcite here the on - site energies are kept at their `` physical '' values from the very beginning rather than being determined from the self - consistency condition .",
    "the ( cellular ) dmft , however , can be considered as a special approximation within the general sft framework .",
    "@xcite hence , the question arises why a fixed on - site energy does _ not _ spoil thermodynamic consistency in the case of ( cellular ) dmft .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in case of interacting bosons , the issue of consistency has also been shown to be very important , recently .",
    "@xcite    second , an accurate analysis of the behavior of the chemical potential as a function of the particle density close to the transition to a non - magnetic state , as well as a corresponding maxwell construction , indicate the presence of an inhomogeneous ground state with macroscopically large regions of low- and high - particle density .",
    "using @xmath17-site clusters , we can get a rough estimate of the ground - state phase diagram and investigate the instability of the homogeneous ( af , sc ) phases against charge inhomogeneities .",
    "this represents an important complement to the work of ref .  , where larger cluster sizes up to @xmath18 sites have been considered but without an appropriate analysis via a maxwell construction .",
    "finally , our numerical results give valuable insights into different questions of the high-@xmath1 problem , as they provide direct access to the single - particle excitation spectrum in the strong - coupling regime at zero temperature .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the work of maier et al .",
    "@xcite who have been able to treat clusters with @xmath19 sites within the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) , but are restricted to finite temperatures , intermediate coupling @xmath20 and imaginary time .",
    "a review comparing the application of different cluster ( sft , dca , and cellular dmft ) as well as weak - coupling methods for the hubbard model has appeared recently .",

    "we discuss how the characteristically different doping dependencies of the spectra give rise to different fermi - surface evolutions upon doping .",
    "these fermi - surface evolutions can then be tied up with the characteristic differences in the electron- and hole - doped phase diagrams , such as the enhanced robustness of the af order in the electron - doped case .",

    "why is it more advantageous to express @xmath39 as a functional of the self - energy @xmath29 rather than @xmath6 ?",

    ", one believes that important effects are sufficiently accounted for by a local @xcite or short - ranged @xcite self - energy , at least for high lattice dimensions .",
    "a local or short - ranged self - energy , however , can be well generated by a cluster of finite size , and for the subsequent optimization of the cluster trial self - energy , the self - energy functional ( [ eq : sf ] ) can be used .",
    "this concept allows for the construction of a class of conceptually clear and thermodynamically consistent approximations , including the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and a cluster extension of the dmft @xcite ( see ref .   for a detailed discussion ) .    due to the universality of @xmath40",

    "in the following , we will concentrate on two cluster approaches : ( i ) the variational cluster approach ( vca ) @xcite and ( ii ) the cellular dmft ( c - dmft ) .",
    "@xcite the vca can be seen as a variational generalization of the cluster - perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite it is obtained by partitioning the infinite lattice into disconnected ( identical ) clusters of @xmath51 sites each and choosing @xmath44 to consist of the intra - cluster parts only , i.e.  the inter - cluster hopping is switched off in @xmath44 .",
    "the c - dmft is a cluster variant of the dmft . in the context of the sft",
    ", it is obtained in the same way as the vca but with an additional coupling of each of the @xmath51 correlated cluster sites to a continuous bath , i.e.  to an infinite number of uncorrelated additional bath sites .",
    "the on - site energies of the bath sites as well as their coupling to the original sites are treated as variational parameters .",
    "once a reference system is specified , one should , in principle , vary _ all _ one - particle parameters of @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure would give the optimal result but requires a search for a stationary point in a high - dimensional parameter space .",
    "from a pragmatic point of view it is thus advisable to concentrate on a few parameters only which have to be selected by physical arguments . here",
    ", we argue that the variation of the on - site energies is important to achieve thermodynamic consistency with respect to the average particle number . in case of the hubbard model , this means to consider the site - independent energy @xmath52 as ( one of the ) variational parameter(s ) .",
    "the average particle number @xmath53 can be calculated in two different ways : on the `` zero - particle level '' by differentiation of the grand potential with respect to the chemical potential @xmath30 : @xmath54 and on the `` one - particle level '' by frequency integration of the one - particle excitation spectrum : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the local ( possibly spin - dependent ) spectral density with @xmath57 for short , and @xmath58 is the fermi function . for simplicity ,",
    "we exclude non - collinear magnetic states and assume all expectation values to be diagonal in the spin index .",
    "thermodynamic consistency means that both ways of calculating @xmath53 yield the same result .",
    "since @xmath59 $ ] is the _ approximate _ sft grand potential at the stationary point @xmath60 , and since the spectral density or , equivalently , the one - particle green s function is the _ approximate _ green s function given by @xmath61 , the equivalence of ( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) is by no means understood _ a priori_.    to prove thermodynamic consistency , we start from eq .",

    "this is a subtlety which , however , can be ignored since @xmath69 for @xmath60 because of stationarity condition ( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "( actually , only those elements of @xmath68 show up a @xmath30 dependence that are treated as variational parameters . according to the chain rule",
    ", however , the derivative of @xmath39 has to be performed just with respect to those elements , with a vanishing result due to the stationarity condition . )",
    "the self - energy , the green s function and the grand potential of the reference system are defined as grand - canonical averages .",
    "hence , their @xmath30 dependence due to the grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath70 is ( apart from the sign ) the same as their dependence on @xmath71 : @xmath72 , etc .",
    "consequently , we have : @xmath73 the first derivative is readily calculated : @xmath74 here , the contour @xmath75 encloses the first - order poles of the fermi function at @xmath76 in counter - clockwise direction .",
    "using cauchy s theorem , we can proceed to an integration over real frequencies . inserting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : exim ] ) , we get : @xmath77 for @xmath60 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is just the expression for the average particle number given by ( [ eq : n2 ] ) .",

    "@xmath71 is included in the set of variational parameters . in this case one",
    "has thermodynamic consistency .",
    "if @xmath71 was not treated as a variational parameter but kept at the value given by the original system , @xmath78 , one would have a finite @xmath79 in ( [ eq : nn ] ) , and the two expressions ( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) for the average particle number would yield different results .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "( [ eq : n1 ] ) for the average particle number of the lattice model can be compared with @xmath80 which gives the average particle number of the reference system .",
    "again , there are two ways to get @xmath81 : either as the derivative of the reference system s grand potential @xmath82 or by frequency integration of the reference system s spectral density @xmath83 .",
    "as the reference system is solved exactly , both ways must yield the same result .",
    "note , however , that @xmath84 in general .",
    "the above reasoning can straightforwardly be generalized to the off - diagonal ( @xmath85 ) elements of the one - particle density matrix @xmath86 .",

    "<S> the competition between @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( sc ) and antiferromagnetism ( af ) in the high-@xmath1 cuprates is investigated by studying the hole- and electron - doped two - dimensional hubbard model with a recently proposed variational quantum - cluster theory . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is shown to provide a thermodynamically consistent determination of the particle number , provided that an overall shift of the on - site energies is treated as a variational parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences for the single - particle excitation spectra and for the phase diagram are explored . by comparing the single - particle spectra with quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) and experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we verify that the low - energy excitations in a strongly - correlated electronic system are described appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster calculations also reproduce the overall ground - state phase diagram of the high - temperature superconductors . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> they include salient features such as the enhanced robustness of the antiferromagnetic state as a function of electron doping and the tendency towards phase separation into a mixed antiferromagnetic - superconducting phase at low - doping and a pure superconducting phase at high ( both hole and electron ) doping . </S>"
