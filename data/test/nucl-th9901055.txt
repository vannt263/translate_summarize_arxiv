    "there have been a number of attempts to study hypernuclei containing not only nucleons but also hyperons with strangeness @xcite .",
    "it has been of high interest to investigate how the presence of strangeness broadens and/or modifies the knowledge achieved in the field of ordinary nuclear physics .",
    "it is a fundamental problem to understand properties of a quantum many - body system in terms of basic interactions between constituent particles . in hypernuclear physics a unified treatment of all the baryon - baryon interactions , especially nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interactions ,",
    "will be necessary if one wish to understand general properties of hypernuclei . however , our knowledge on the @xmath5 interaction is quite inadequate in contrast to that of the @xmath6 interaction due to experimental difficulties .",
    "in such a situation many - body theoretical studies of hypernuclei could provide alternative information on the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "it has been discussed that physics of hypernuclei is different from conventional nuclear physics in some aspects .",
    "first , the channel couplings such as the @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling play a significant role in the structure of hypernuclei in contrast to the very limited role of the @xmath9-@xmath10 coupling appeared in nuclear many - body systems @xcite .",
    "second , the anti - symmetric spin - orbit force , which is forbidden in ordinary nuclei , emerges in hypernuclei in addition to the symmetric spin - orbit force .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath11 single - particle levels in @xmath11 hypernuclei was considered experimentally to be much smaller than their nucleonic counterpart @xcite . however , some recent studies as in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the splitting would not be so small as discussed earlier",
    ". it will be highly desirable for the spin - orbit splitting to be established in experiment .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - orbit splitting will put further constraints on the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "there have been several possibilities of solving the structure of hypernuclei .",
    "one possibility is to treat few - body or light hypernuclei by solving the faddeev equation @xcite or by applying the cluster model @xcite .",
    "another possibility is microscopic studies of hypernuclei with a larger mass number .",
    "while a few lower partial waves play a decisive role in few - body or light hypernuclei , higher partial waves could give some contributions in heavier hypernuclei .",
    "these microscopic studies of hypernuclei could make us understand interesting physics of their structure itself , and also help us in determining the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "microscopic structure calculation of heavier hypernuclei is usually performed by introducing a @xmath12 effective interaction . for this purpose",
    "the @xmath13-matrix theory has been applied in two ways : in some works an effective @xmath5 interaction has been derived by simulating a nuclear matter @xmath13-matrix . in this approach the non - locality and energy dependence of the @xmath13-matrix",
    "are neglected , and the effective @xmath5 interaction is represented in the two- or three - range gaussian form with the adjustable fermi momentum @xmath14 .",
    "this type of the effective interaction has been referred to as the yng interaction @xcite .",
    "the yng interaction has been successfully used in many of hypernuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "it seems to us that the yng interaction has made an important contribution to the considerable progress in overall description of hypernuclei .",
    "the other approach , in the framework of the @xmath13-matrix theory , is to calculate the @xmath13-matrix in finite hypernuclei by treating rigorously the pauli exclusion operator and making a self - consistent calculation of single - particle potential of hyperons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to studies of using the yng interaction this approach possibly gives a better description of the state dependence of the effective @xmath5 interaction .",
    "it has been established that the @xmath13-matrix can be used as a basic ingredient in constructing a microscopic many - body theory starting with bare interactions .    in spite of a marked success in the applications of the @xmath13-matrix theory",
    ", we may say from a formal point of view that the @xmath13-matrix is energy - dependent and non - hermitian , and does not have the property of decoupling between a model space of low - lying two - particle states and its complement .",
    "the @xmath13-matrix is not considered to be an effective interaction in a formal sense of the effective interaction theory . in order to derive an effective interaction",
    "we should add some higher - order corrections such as folded diagrams @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable if we could have a theory describing many - body systems in terms of an energy - independent and hermitian effective interaction with the property of decoupling .",
    "two of the present authors , k.  s. and r.  o. , proposed a many - body theory , the unitary - model - operator approach ( umoa ) that was formulated on the basis of such an effective interaction .",
    "the umoa was applied to finite nuclei , @xmath15o and @xmath16ca @xcite , and some improvements have been attained .",
    "the method may be viewed as an alternative way of deriving an effective interaction in finite many - body systems .",
    "a unified study of hypernuclei and ordinary nuclei would be helpful in understanding many - body systems of baryons in a microscopic way .",
    "therefore , we extended the formulation of the umoa , in the previous work @xcite , to the description of hypernuclei and made a calculation of the properties in @xmath17o with a realistic @xmath12 interaction .",
    "the purposes of this work are to present a general formulation of the extended umoa and apply it to @xmath17o by employing some realistic @xmath12 interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a general formulation of the umoa for deriving the @xmath18 effective interaction . in section 3 the approximation procedure",
    "is given for making actual calculations .",
    "in section 4 we apply the umoa to @xmath17o by employing the nijmegen soft - core ( nsc ) @xcite , jlich model -  ( j ) and model - b ( jb ) @xcite @xmath12 potentials . in section 5",
    "we make some concluding remarks .",
    "we present a formulation of the umoa for applying to a calculation of the properties in @xmath11 hypernuclei , especially , closed - shell nucleus plus one @xmath11 systems .",
    "a main purpose is to give a method of calculating an effective interaction between @xmath11 and @xmath19 . in the derivation of the @xmath8 effective interaction",
    "we should note that , because of the small mass difference of about 77mev between @xmath11 and @xmath20 , the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 channels plays an important role .",

    "3 . therefore , as @xmath140 becomes larger , the calculated result does more accurate .",
    "if the result converges at a certain number @xmath251 , we may say that the method of the two - step calculation of the @xmath8 effective interaction would be trustworthy . as shown in fig .  4 ,",
    "the results are convergent and stable for @xmath252 for each @xmath12 potential .",
    "if we take @xmath93 larger than 6 , our model space is considered to be sufficiently large .",

    "channel the largest pauli - blocking effect is brought about in the result for the j potential . on the other hand , in the @xmath262-@xmath263 channel we have an extremely large pauli - blocking effect for the nsc potential .",
    "this result shows that the nsc potential has the strong @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling in the @xmath262-@xmath263 channel as discussed in ref .",
    "the absolute values contributing to the first - order potential energy of @xmath32 in the channels with angular momenta @xmath264 are much smaller than those in the @xmath261 and @xmath262-@xmath263 channels .    in table  5",
    "we display the single - particle energies of @xmath32 with the contributions of the perturbation corrections given in fig .  3 , where the pauli - blocking effect is treated accordingly to case ( 3 ) .",
    "from this table we see that the j and nsc potentials yield almost the same values of the first - order potential energy pe and the perturbation corrections in spite of having different partial - wave contributions as shown in table  4 .",
    "the single - particle energies obtained for the jb potential are most attractive among the @xmath265 interactions used .",
    "it should be noted here that the values of the ke plus pe in the 0@xmath266 states for three kinds of @xmath5 interactions are positive ( unbound ) .",
    "therefore , the perturbation corrections play a decisive role when we argue that the @xmath32 in the 0@xmath266 states is bound or not .",
    "correction ( a ) in fig .",
    "3 is induced by the presence of non - diagonal terms in the one - body hamiltonian @xmath267 .",
    "this effect should be treated in the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation . however , in the present calculation , we treat this effect perturbatively .",
    "these non - diagonal terms work to change the single - particle wave function of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , this procedure is indispensable in this approach since we have taken a fixed value of @xmath100 commonly for @xmath32 and @xmath19 .",
    "this correction  ( a ) contributes most attractively to the single - particle energies among all the corrections in fig .",
    "the magnitude of every correction is considerably small in comparison with the first - order potential energies for all the @xmath5 interactions used .",
    "all the perturbation corrections contribute , however , attractively to the single - particle energies of @xmath32 , and do not change the mutual spacings of the single - particle states significantly .",
    "this trend is very different from the situation observed in ordinary nuclei such as @xmath15o and @xmath16ca , in which the correction terms contribute to about 40@xmath268 of the calculated spin - orbit splitting of the 0@xmath266 or 0@xmath269 states @xcite .",
    "the role of many - body correlations , such as the core polarization , does not seem to be important in the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath32 .",
    "we have presented a formulation of the umoa to apply it to a structure calculation of hypernuclei .",
    "we have introduced a unitary transformation exp(@xmath270 ) , with the correlation operator @xmath270 , that describes two - body correlation of hyperon and nucleon .",
    "an equation has been given for determining the correlation operator @xmath270 as the equation of decoupling so that the unitarily transformed interaction does not have non - zero matrix elements between the model space @xmath88 of low - lying @xmath8 states and its complement @xmath85 .",
    "the effective interaction has been given by the projected interaction onto the @xmath88 space .",
    "the effective interaction thus determined has properties of being hermitian , energy - independent and decoupled between the @xmath88 and @xmath85 spaces . in comparison with the usual @xmath13-matrix approach , the use of such an effective interaction would have some advantages in describing many - body systems .",
    "the umoa has been applied to the calculation of the structure of @xmath0o .",
    "the @xmath8 effective interaction has been calculated by employing three @xmath12 potentials , namely , the j , jb and nsc potentials . with the @xmath8 effective interaction ,",
    "we have calculated the single - particle energies of @xmath32 in the 0@xmath1 , 0@xmath2 and 0@xmath3 states .",
    "we have seen that how to treat the pauli - blocking effect is very important , especially when we solve the problem of the @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling . in the usual treatment one",
    "excludes all the interactions acting in a space of @xmath271 and @xmath272 states in which a nucleon is in occupied states .",
    "however , this treatment of the pauli - blocking effect would lead to overmuch counting .",
    "we have introduced a new treatment in which , while we exclude the interactions acting among forbidden @xmath5 states as in the usual treatment , we restore the interactions that are diagonal in occupied nucleon states .",
    "we have observed that this treatment of the pauli - blocking effect has given rise to a significant effect as compared with the usual treatment .",
    "the present results have shown that @xmath32 in the 0@xmath3 state is unbound for the j and nsc potentials and , on the other hand , bound for the jb potential .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the single - particle levels of @xmath83 in the 0@xmath266 states has been given by 1.41 , 1.57 and 1.66 for the j , jb and nsc potentials , respectively .",
    "these values are very large compared with the results in ref .",
    "it will be of high interest for the single - particle nature of @xmath32 in @xmath0o to be established experimentally .    in the application of the umoa",
    "some problems have still remained .",
    "the unitarily transformed hamiltonian @xcite contains originally three - or - more - body interactions .",
    "the effects of these many - body interactions have been evaluated in the previous works of calculating nuclear properties , and we have concluded that the contributions of these many - body terms are much smaller than those of two - body interactions but sizable in some cases .",
    "we therefore should estimate the effects of these many - body interactions also in hypernuclei .",
    "another refinement to be made is that , in the present calculation , the single - particle energies of @xmath33 in intermediate states are neglected .",
    "however , the single - particle spectrum of @xmath33 has a possibility of giving rise to some contributions to the @xmath8 effective interaction .",
    "although the properties of the single - particle energies of @xmath33 have not always been made clear , we should investigate how much the spectrum of @xmath33 affects in the determination of the @xmath8 effective interaction .",
    "this problem is also a remaining task in the umoa .",
