    ", the internal pressures in the radio lobes are comparable to those in the hot , x - ray emitting phase of the external medium , rather than greatly exceeding it as had sometimes been thought to be the case ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "we know of only a few objects  the best example being the inner lobes of centaurus a @xcite  in which the internal lobe pressures must be much larger than the inferred external pressure , although the limited numbers of such sources found to date is almost certainly affected by selection effects .    in the objects where the pressures of the radio - emitting plasma and the x - ray - emitting external medium are comparable , the dynamics of the large - scale radio structures , the lobes and plumes , will be determined , at least in part , by the properties of the hot gas .",

    "at the same time , the lobes displace and compress the material that they expand into , as is evident from observations of ` cavities ' in the x - ray - emitting material ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this means that , when we observe a radio galaxy and its environment , and see a relationship between radio - emitting structures and those in the x - ray , it is often not clear whether what we are seeing is a pre - existing distribution of hot gas that has shaped the radio source that lies in it , or whether , on the other hand , we are seeing the _ effects _ of the radio source on what would otherwise have been a relatively structure - free external medium .    in a relaxed system that does not host a powerful radio source we do not expect to find long - lasting complex structure in the hot x - ray - emitting plasma of a group or cluster atmosphere , since any such structure will be washed out on a sound - crossing time .",

    "would be expected to give rise to structures in the group or cluster atmosphere , both because they produce a local gravitational potential that is not radially symmetrical and because frictional and tidal processes will give rise to the stripping and heating of gas from the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we fitted to data in the energy range 0.47.0 kev unless otherwise stated : spectra were binned , typically to 20 net counts per bin after background subtraction , so that @xmath16 statistics could be applied .",
    "errors quoted on parameters derived from xspec fitting are the 90 per cent confidence range for one interesting parameter , unless otherwise stated , but errors quoted on measured numbers such as flux densities or numbers of counts are the @xmath17 errors . where counts are quoted the @xmath17 errors are derived from the gaussian ( @xmath18 ) approximation to the true confidence range , as calculated by the funtools code used to determine the background - subtracted values  this is accurate to better than 10% for @xmath19 counts ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the gaussian assumption is necessary in any case if we are to combine errors in the standard way with the uncertainty on the expected background counts .",
    "the x - ray nucleus of 3c285 has already been discussed by @xcite , using the same _ chandra _ dataset .",
    "they found that it was well modelled as a double power law , with one component being heavily absorbed ( @xmath20 @xmath14 ) and one having only galactic absorption .",
    "the nucleus was relatively weak , and so in their fits the poorly constrained power - law indices were fixed to 2.0 and 1.7 for the unabsorbed and absorbed components respectively .",
    "a combination of absorbed and unabsorbed emission is consistent with what is seen for other narrow - line frii radio galaxies .",
    "3c442a is a low - excitation radio galaxy @xcite  i.e. , a nuclear spectrum of ngc 7237 shows no strong high - excitation emission - line features  and so we might expect not to see a heavily absorbed nuclear component @xcite .",
    "we extracted spectra for the x - ray source corresponding to the currently active radio core using a small ( 6 standard @xmath21 _ chandra _ pixels in radius ) circular extraction region and a concentric background annulus ( between 6 and 9 pixels ) .",
    "the nuclear spectra can be fitted acceptably ( @xmath22 for 12 degrees of freedom ) with a single power law model with galactic absorption and variable normalization ( see below ) , although the best - fitting single power - law photon index fitted to all four spectra simultaneously is rather flat ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "there is some evidence in radial profiles of the core region that even this small - scale extraction region contains extended emission , and so it is possible that the spectra are contaminated by some thermal emission , but adding a thermal component does not significantly change the best - fitting power - law spectrum . adding some intrinsic absorption ( the same column density for all four epochs )",
    "gives a more typical power - law index ( @xmath24 ) and a column density of @xmath25 @xmath14 , with a somewhat improved fit ( @xmath26 for 11 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this column density is high , but not unprecedentedly high , compared to other low - power sources , and may indicate some obscuration by the small - scale dust lane that is seen to cross the nucleus in the _ hst _ observation .",
    "we estimate a maximum @xmath27 for the off - nuclear extinction seen in the _ hst _ data taken with the f547 m filter , which would be consistent with the lower end of the confidence range for the x - ray absorbing column for a galactic gas to dust ratio .",
    "the core was clearly variable over the time period of our observations , and acceptable fits were not obtained unless we allowed the normalizations of the power laws fitted to each dataset to vary .",
    "the normalizations for the four epochs listed in table [ obs ] correspond to 1-kev flux densities of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 njy respectively ( assuming galactic absorption only : flux densities would be approximately a factor 2 higher for the best - fitting absorbing column ) .",
    "variability of the photon index as well as the normalization might explain the relatively poor fit and flat photon index given by the combined dataset , but the data are not good enough to constrain this possibility .",
    "we were initially concerned that the variability might be an artefact of the data , as the core in the third observation ( obsid 6359 ) lies close to a node boundary , with many events in the core region in the level 1 events file being flagged as being on or near a bad pixel .",
    "however , we are satisfied that the ancillary response files ( arfs ) make an adequate correction for this reduced effective exposure time , and we have verified that regions taken from the thermal emission close to the core (  [ tail - fit ] ) do not show any variability in count rate or fitted parameters .",
    "we therefore infer that the core is genuinely variable , presumably because of ongoing agn activity .",
    "the 5-ghz flux density of the core of 3c442a is 3.1 mjy in the vla data we use , compared to the value of 1.9 mjy from earlier radio observations tabulated by @xcite , so that it appears that the radio core may be similarly variable on long timescales ( months in the case of the x - ray , years in the case of the radio ) .",
    "the approximate positions , given the uncertainties imposed by variability and non - simultaneous observations , of the source on the radio / x - ray core flux density and luminosity correlations for low-@xmath32 sources @xcite are consistent with expectations .",
    "the bolometric unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the core region ranges between 2 and @xmath33 erg s@xmath1 , which puts it well above the expectation from x - ray binaries from the whole galaxy @xcite given the @xmath34-band optical luminosity of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the jets and hotspots of some low - power frii radio galaxies ( e.g. , 3c403 , @xcite ) show prominent synchrotron x - ray counterparts to compact radio features .",
    "3c285 has a well - defined though faint jet and counterjet in the radio and a bright compact hotspot ( in the e lobe ) . however",
    ", none of these is detectable as an x - ray source in the chandra observation ( fig.[285-highres - overlay ] ) .",
    "the only convincingly detected compact feature in the lobes in the _ chandra _ data ( with @xmath36 counts in the 0.5 - 5.0 kev energy band ) is spatially coincident with the blue object denoted 09.6 by @xcite , lying within @xmath37 of the peak of the resolved optical emission in the _ hst _ images , with a centroiding uncertainty of @xmath38 .",
    "09.6 was identified by @xcite as a star - forming galaxy that is at the redshift of 3c285 s host , whose star formation may be related to the nearby radio jet .",
    "roughly , the unabsorbed bolometric x - ray luminosity of this object in the _ chandra _ band is of the order of @xmath39 erg s@xmath1 ( assuming a mekal model with @xmath40 kev ) , which is a plausible luminosity for a dwarf starburst system with @xmath41 ( the absolute magnitude quoted by @xcite : our different cosmology makes no significant difference ) : for example , it is comparable to , though somewhat higher than , the luminosities derived for a sample of nearby , generally somewhat optically fainter dwarf starbursts by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray detection is thus consistent with the starburst interpretation for 09.6 .",
    "the non - detections of x - ray emission from the jets and hotspots in 3c285 correspond to upper limits on the x - ray flux density .",
    "roughly , a @xmath42 upper limit on the total background - subtracted counts in the 0.5 - 5.0 kev energy range from a region corresponding to the brightest compact hotspot ( in the e lobe ) is @xmath43 counts : this corresponds to a flux density limit of @xmath44 njy at 1 kev for a source with photon index 2.0 .",
    "however , the radio flux densities for the hotspot components are faint compared to the sources in which x - ray emission has been seen .",
    "the total 5-ghz flux density of the e hotspot is 6 mjy , which implies that @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the two - point radio - to - x - ray energy spectral index : @xmath47 is defined here and throughout the paper in the sense that flux density @xmath48 ) , but this is not a very strong constraint , as there are some hotspots with detected synchrotron x - ray emission that show @xmath49 @xcite , while we would expect any synchrotron self - compton emission at equipartition to be at the level of about 10 pjy .",
    "the e hotspot of 3c285 is potentially interesting as it is the one claimed by @xcite to show an optical counterpart .",
    "however , examination of the f702w _ hst _ observations ( originally discussed by @xcite ) shows that the peak of the optical emission from the hotspot region is offset by @xmath50 from the peak of the radio emission , using the default astrometry , which gives a reasonably good alignment ( offset @xmath51 ) between the radio core and the center of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ 285-hst ] ) .",
    "more importantly the optical object is morphologically quite different from the radio structure , and seems most likely to be a faint irregular galaxy .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no evidence for any emission from the e hotspot of 3c285 in any band other than the radio .",
    "the w hotspot is fainter in the radio , so again we can only put weak limits on the radio to x - ray spectral index , and it has no detectable optical counterparts .",
    "overall , the hotspots of 3c285 seem to present a rather different picture to those seen in other nearby frii radio galaxies of similar power such as 3c403 @xcite , 3c321 @xcite and 3c33 @xcite .",
    "the hotspots of these objects , which have radio luminosities spanning a range around that of 3c285 , often have optical / ir and x - ray counterparts ; their x - ray emission , largely inferred to be of synchrotron origin , has @xmath52 .",
    "the lack of an optical counterpart in particular may suggest that 3c285 s hotspots are not able to accelerate particles to even moderately high energies .",
    "however , the biased nature of existing observations of nearby radio galaxies , many of which have been selected for observation because of their prominent radio or optical hotspots , makes it hard to say which is more typical .",
    "[ opt - hotspot ]      as discussed in  [ 442-intro ] , it is not clear whether any of the bright compact radio sources in the 3c442a lobe are related to the radio galaxy itself .",

    "for 3c442a , the non - detection of inverse - compton emission gives us limits on the extent to which the lobe pressures can be dominated by electrons .",
    "we determine pressures as a function of radius in the groups for the detected large - scale thermal components using the method of @xcite , assuming spherical symmetry .",

    "we use the two measured dimensions of the spectral extraction region for the ridge to estimate its size in the plane of the sky .",
    "the extension along the line of sight is uncertain , and we consider two cases , treating the ridge either as a cylinder whose long axis is in the plane of the sky , or as a disk viewed edge - on . because the density depends only on the square root of the volume , these two geometries do not give rise to markedly different densities and pressures .",
    "the minimum pressures in the ne and sw lobes of 3c285 are @xmath303 pa and @xmath304 pa respectively ( the difference arises because of the fainter flux density and larger volume of the sw lobe ) . if we assume that all the x - ray flux from the ne lobe is inverse - compton in origin , its pressure is @xmath305 pa , where the error comes from the uncertainty on the measured x - ray flux density .",
    "this is an upper limit on the pressure if the lobes are electron - dominated .",
    "for the group - scale emission , the extrapolated pressure at the base of the lobes , @xmath306 ( 15 kpc ) in projection from the nucleus , using the best - fitting @xmath246 model , is @xmath307 pa ( the dominant error here is the uncertainty on the best - fitting x - ray temperature : the uncertainties on density from the @xmath246 model fits are far smaller ) . at the far end of the lobes , @xmath308 ( 140 kpc ) from the core ,",
    "the thermal pressure is @xmath309 pa . formal errors due to the arbitrarily assumed abundance of 0.35 solar can not be estimated from the data , but pressure would increase by a factor 1.5 if the abundance were 0.1 solar and decrease by a factor 1.5 if it were 1.0 solar , giving a range which is similar in magnitude to that derived from the uncertainties in temperature .",
    "even with the large uncertainties on both internal and external pressure , it is clear that 3c285 resembles other low - power frii sources in poor environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as more powerful objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in having lobes that are close to being in pressure balance with the external thermal environment .",
    "it seems likely that at their far ends the lobes are continuing to expand at subsonic or mildly supersonic speeds ( even the maximum possible external thermal pressure only just balances the internal minimum pressure of the ne lobe here ) , while at the ends closest to the nucleus they can no longer expand transversely .    the pressure in the central ` ridge ' , assuming our best - fitting temperature and a uniform distribution of x - ray emitting gas , is @xmath310 pa ( cylindrical geometry ) or @xmath311 pa ( disk geometry ) , where the errors are again dominated by the errors on our spectrally determined temperature ( we use the best - fitting single - temperature model for simplicity ) and again extreme variations in abundance could cause pressure variations by a factor 1.5 in either direction .",
    "this ridge pressure is in some sense a mean pressure in the region  if there is a density gradient , as the surface brightness suggests , then the pressure will be higher closer to the center and lower at the edges .",
    "thus , the fact that the ` ridge ' pressure is comparable to or higher than the lobe pressure means that if our radio pressure calculations are correct ( i.e. the lobes are not dominated in pressure terms by some non - radiating component such as protons ) then we would predict that the lobes must avoid the region of the ridge .",
    "this is consistent with the observation ( fig .",
    "[ 285-smooth ] ) that the lobe plasma largely avoids the ridge ; in fact , the extensions of the lobes at the base to the s ( ` wings ' ) are on scales that suggest that the lobe plasma may be flowing around the ridge .",
    "the anticoincidence between the lobe material and the ridge is not perfect , but this is likely to be due to projection , since the jet - counterjet asymmetry in 3c285 strongly suggests that the radio source is not precisely in the plane of the sky .",
    "for 3c442a we measure minimum pressures ( using the assumptions discussed above ) from the outer regions of the lobe only , ignoring the central region where an assumption of uniform plasma filling factor would clearly not be appropriate , so that the pressures measured here are for the parts of the source that lie outside the ridge region on fig .",
    "[ 442-large ] .",
    "the minimum pressures we obtain are @xmath312 and @xmath313 pa for the ne and sw lobes respectively .",
    "these are lower than the 3c285 pressures , since 3c442a has both lower radio luminosity and a slightly larger physical size .",
    "the external thermal pressures are much larger than the minimum pressures at all points in the radio source . at @xmath314 ( 25 kpc ) , the inner edge of the region measured for the ne lobe ,",
    "the extrapolated pressure ( our @xmath246-model fit does not extend to this radius ) is @xmath315 pa ( where the large ( 90% confidence ) errors we quote come entirely from the poorly constrained temperature : the uncertainties from @xmath246-model fitting are negligible by comparison , though there is a possibility of systematic errors due to the extrapolation , and we assume that large deviations from the abundance fitted to the ridge are not likely ) . at the edges of the lobes at @xmath280 ",
    "@xmath316 ( 150180 kpc ) the pressures are still @xmath317 pa , at least an order of magnitude above the radio minimum pressures .",
    "thus , although 3c442a s radio structure is not that of a classical fri radio source , it obeys a tendency that has been known for many years ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and rediscovered recently in the context of cluster - center sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for low - power radio sources to have minimum pressures that lie substantially ( often 12 orders of magnitude ) below the external thermal pressure .",
    "radio lobes can not evolve to a state in which they are substantially underpressured with respect to the external medium : both theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and observation @xcite imply that they are likely to be strongly overpressured initially , and , while the internal pressure should drop as the linear size of the source increases , any drop below the external pressure will cause the external thermal material to expand into the lobe region , compressing the lobe plasma until pressure balance is restored .",
    "observations that suggest that the minimum pressure is below the external pressure therefore imply some additional contribution to the internal pressure , via a large departure from equipartition , a low filling factor , and/or a dominant contribution from non - radiating particles such as protons .",
    "a departure from equipartition in the direction of electron dominance is almost certainly ruled out , since at pressure balance it would produce a 1-kev flux density via inverse - compton scattering of the cmbr of about 90 njy per lobe , giving a count rate in _ chandra _ observations that would exceed that from the thermal emission from the entire group .",
    "in fact , if anything there is a deficit of x - ray emission from the lobes , particularly the w lobe , as mentioned above . as magnetic domination by large factors",
    "is not observed in lobes of sources where inverse - compton emission can be studied @xcite , we favor a model in which the lobe pressure is dominated by non - radiating particles . in the case of more typical fri sources",
    "it has been suggested that protons from the external thermal material could be entrained and efficiently heated to high energies by the jets ( temperatures much greater than that of the external thermal material are required to avoid the detection of this component through its thermal bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "as no jets of the sort seen in normal fris are present in 3c442a , this explanation would only be viable if the lobes were at one time driven by fri - type jets that are now no longer present , or no longer visible .",
    "alternatively , a population of relativistic protons could have been injected into the lobes along with the radiating electrons ( though this is inconsistent with the picture in frii lobes where an energetically dominant proton population is disfavored : @xcite ) or the lobes could have engulfed large regions of thermal material , though again some unknown efficient heating mechanism would be required .    the pressure in the ` ridge ' in 3c442a , again assuming uniform density , is @xmath318 pa ( cylindrical geometry ) or @xmath319 pa ( disk geometry ) , so , unsurprisingly , the ridge pressure is equal to or exceeds the extrapolated central pressure of the extended emission , in spite of the lower temperature of the ridge material ( here again we are using the best - fitting single - temperature model for the ridge ) .",
    "the pressures derived by @xcite , using a @xmath246-model fit to the ridge region , are similar .",
    "thus even if the lobe is in pressure balance with the thermal material further out ( as it must be , to avoid collapse on a sound - crossing time ) the lobe pressure will be lower than the ridge pressure , and the lobe material will be excluded from the ridge region unless it can achieve higher pressures .",
    "[ 442-large ] shows that material in the lobes , particularly the w lobe , does seem to be avoiding the ridge and to be being pushed out in wings to the n and s , as well as possibly along the line of sight ( note the strong radio brightness gradient to the w of the ridge ) .",
    "there is still radio - emitting material in the ridge region , but , as discussed above , the brightest components are in the form of filaments that are likely to be interacting strongly with the small - scale material from the galaxies , and these filaments will have pressures substantially higher than the lobe material as a whole ( see below ,  [ tails ] , for more discussion of this point ) .",
    "[ ridge - pressure ]      is the ` ridge ' structure intrinsic to the system , or could it be a result of the interaction of the radio galaxy with an initially spherically symmetrical gas distribution ?",
    "there are two strong indications that the former is the case : firstly , the ridges align well with the local distribution of galaxies and starlight , which can not be affected by the radio galaxy , in both 3c285 and 3c442a ; secondly , in 3c442a , we observe material leaving the two central bright galaxies via the tails and merging with the ridge",
    ". quantitatively , we can compare the mass in the ridges ( or rather in the somewhat smaller spectral extraction regions used to derive temperatures and pressures ) with the masses of thermal material affected by the lobes . using the approximations of uniform density from the previous section , we find that the ` ridge ' gas masses are in the range @xmath320 to @xmath321 for 3c285 and @xmath322 to @xmath323 for 3c442a . using the @xmath246-model fits to the larger - scale thermal emission , we find that for 3c285 the ridge mass is similar to , but somewhat greater than , the total mass of gas that would be present in the lobe regions if the lobes were not there : thus , since only a fraction of the displaced gas would be expected to end up in the ridges , it is essentially impossible for the radio lobes to be responsible for producing the ridge in 3c285 ( though of course here we have to assume that the distribution of the gas in the regions away from the lobes of the radio source now is similar to its undisturbed distribution ) .",
    "the constraints are less strong for 3c442a , with larger lobes , a denser thermal environment , and a smaller ridge mass : roughly @xmath324 of the displaced gas would be sufficient to produce the observed ridge . however , we know that in 3c442a at least some of the gas in the ridge did _ not _ come via this route , since some of it must have passed through the tails . _ some _ contribution from compressed , displaced gas would help to explain the overdensities seen to the n and s of the w lobe (  [ tail - fit ] and fig .",
    "[ 442-large ] ) ( although note that these are not included in our mass calculations ) .",
    "we conclude that the ridge structures in these two sources are largely or wholly independent of the presence of the radio lobes .",
    "our outline models of the evolution of the two radio sources are somewhat different , because we know that the formation of the ridge in 3c442a is still going on given the observations of tails of gas from the two central galaxies ( see  [ tails ] , below ) while there is no evidence that there is ongoing gas stripping in 3c285 .",
    "3c285 thus presents the simpler situation , and we consider it first . in this system",
    "we consider it entirely possible that the ridge was present in something like its current configuration before the radio activity began .",
    "it is possible , although the data do not require it , that some of the gas that now forms the ridge was stripped from the galaxies that merged to form the current host galaxy of 3c285 . whether this is true or not , we have seen that the ridge is in rough pressure equilibrium with the external group - scale gas , at least in the center of the group .",
    "the timescale for the relaxation of the ridge back towards a spherically symmetrical situation , assuming that the gravitational potential is spherically symmetric , is thus likely to be comparable to the sound - crossing time for the _ long _ axis of the ridge , i.e. a few @xmath325 years .",
    "if the gravitational potential is non - static , the relevant timescale is the gravitational relaxation time , whch could be longer still . since the expansion of the 3c285 lobes is likely to have been supersonic initially ( and may still just be supersonic at present ) the growth of the lobes to similar size scales can take place in a much shorter time , a few @xmath326 years , and so it seems consistent to suppose that the ridge has not evolved greatly while the lobes have expanded .",
    "the expanding lobes would initially be confined by ram pressure and so would expand preferentially into the lower - density group - scale medium .",
    "later , as the lobe internal pressure dropped , the ridge material would push any lobe material out of the center of the group , leading to the situation we now see , where the currently observed ridge is in rough pressure balance with lobes that avoid the central part of the system .    the more complex situation in 3c442a is discussed in detail by @xcite . in outline ,",
    "our suggested picture is that here a large , old radio source could well have been present _ before _",
    "the start of the ongoing interaction that produced the presently visible ridge material . by stripping and disrupting the hot gas in the center of the group , the start of the interaction / merger between ngc 7236/7 may have terminated the energy supply to the lobes . in any case , the resulting ridge has now largely driven the lobe material out of the center of the group , although the interaction with radio filaments ( see  [ tails ] below ) shows that this process is not yet complete .",
    "buoyancy will remove the remaining filaments on a relatively short timescale ( unless they are magnetically anchored to one or other of the galaxies ) , while the ridge may continue to expand , driving the radio lobes ahead of it , as the merger of the two galaxies proceeds to completion .",
    "crudely , the work done on the thermal material by the expanding radio galaxy ( @xmath327 ) may be estimated as @xmath328 , or @xmath329 for pressure balance .",
    "this estimate probably gives constraints that are of the right order of magnitude . for 3c285 the numbers are between @xmath322 and a few @xmath330 j , depending on whether the source is in pressure balance or mildly overpressured at the present time , while for 3c442a the energy input assuming rough pressure balance at the radio lobes is @xmath331 j. in both cases the energy stored in the lobes is 3 times this value ( we assume a relativistic equation of state ) .",
    "these numbers may be compared to the total energy ( @xmath332 ) of the thermal material in the groups ( neglecting the ridges ) integrated out to the radius of the edge of the lobes ( 150 kpc for 3c285 , 160 kpc for 3c442a ) . for 3c285",
    "this thermal energy is @xmath333 j : thus the energy input by the lobes is certainly significant , and the total energy input by the source over its lifetime will be sufficient to unbind or move to large radii a large fraction of the currently existing group - scale gas . for 3c442a , with a denser medium and larger temperature , the thermal energy of the gas is @xmath334 j , so that the impact of the radio source is less relative to the existing thermal energy than in 3c285 : however , again , the total energy input , once the internal energy of the lobes is thermalized , should be very important .",
    "spectral aging ( via inverse - compton losses ) puts a limit on the lifetime of 3c442a of @xmath335 years , while in 3c285 we expect a lifetime of a few @xmath326 years from the dynamical arguments of the previous section .",
    "thus in both cases the rate of energy input is more than enough ( by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude ) to offset the radiative cooling of the group - scale gas given the bolometric luminosities determined in  [ group - properties ] , although in the case of 3c442a some of that work probably comes not from the active nucleus but ( via the expansion of the ridge ) from the dissipation of the energy of the galaxy - galaxy merger .",
    "a significant minority of radio galaxies , particularly low - luminosity friis , have radio lobes that are apparently sharply truncated at an inner edge , as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the truncation means that in radio images there are well - defined sharp - edged gaps between pairs of radio lobes that typically contain no lobe - related radio emission .",
    "@xcite have compiled a sample of such objects , and suggest that the central gaps between the lobes are a result of hydrodynamical interactions with a _ cold _ thermal medium .",
    "while this may be true in some cases , our results show that asymmetrical structures in the hot phase of the igm can have the same effect .",
    "a few other radio galaxies with truncated lobes have x - ray observations , and while some ( e.g. , 3c33 , @xcite ; 3c227 , hardcastle et al.in prep . ) show no obvious signs of asymmetrical x - ray structure on scales comparable to the lobes , at least one other frii radio galaxy , 3c401 , has both elongated x - ray emission filling between the gap between the lobes @xcite , and , crucially , some evidence for elongation of the stellar population in the same e - w direction in _ hubble space telescope _ images @xcite , strongly suggesting that the ` ridge ' structure can not simply be a result of compression of pre - existing symmetrical gas in the cluster environment of the source .",
    "given the evidence that mergers are important in the environments of frii sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is possible that central gaps are related to interaction of the lobes with pre - existing or developing x - ray structures in many other cases .",
    "` tail ' or ` fan'-like x - ray structures have been seen in other strongly interacting galaxy pairs . the twin tails in ngc 7236/7 ( fig.[442-centre ] )",
    "are very similar in structure and physical size to those seen by @xcite in ngc 4782/3 , which consists of two interacting galaxies of similar mass ( one hosting the radio source 3c278 ) with a projected separation of around 13 kpc .",
    "the tails in the 3c278 system are overpressured with respect to the surrounding diffuse medium , implying that they originate in ram pressure stripping of the halos of the interacting ellipticals , and @xcite carried out a detailed analysis of the x - ray surface brightness around the leading edge of one of the galaxy profiles to estimate the approximate speed of motion of the galaxy relative to the igm .",
    "because both tails in 3c442a have some excess x - ray emission in front of the galaxies , we can not repeat the @xcite analysis for 3c442a , but we can make a less rigorous estimate by determining the pressure inside the tails .",
    "the tail of ngc 7237 has only a weak surface brightness gradient over the inner 40@xmath6 ( 20 kpc ) of its length , so we model the x - ray emission as a uniform cylinder of length 20 kpc and radius 7 kpc .",
    "our spectral fit to the tail (  [ tail - fit ] ) then gives a density of @xmath336 m@xmath337 and a pressure of @xmath338 pa ( where the dominant uncertainty comes from the small uncertainty on temperature ) .",
    "to explain why the two dominant galaxies of the group are being ram - pressure stripped _ now _ , rather than having being completely stripped at a much earlier stage of the group s evolution , we must assume that it is their current close interaction that is responsible for the stripping : in this case it is appropriate to compare their pressure and density to the external medium in the ridge , which ( as discussed above ) we infer to be made up primarily of previously stripped material , rather than the group - center hot gas : in any case , the tails are clearly embedded in the ridge .",
    "this comparison gives a density contrast of a factor 3.34.5 ( depending on the geometry assumed for the ridge , see  [ ridge - pressure ] ) and a pressure contrast of a factor @xmath339 , assuming cylindrical geometry since that gives the closest pressure balance with the larger - scale medium .",
    "the tails in 3c442a are thus overpressured and the leading edge must be ram - pressure confined , consistent with the picture of @xcite following @xcite in adopting the relation of @xcite between pressure contrast and mach number @xmath340 , we find that this pressure contrast implies @xmath341 , or a speed with respect to the ridge material of @xmath342 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the models of merger dynamics by @xcite imply velocities @xmath343 km s@xmath1 , in good agreement with this result .",
    "away from the leading edge , we expect the tails to expand transversely into the medium of the ridge at the sound speed , giving rise to the short , stubby structures that are observed and possibly to the apparent flaring of the ngc 7236 tail ( fig.[442-centre ] )    if the filaments seen in the radio image are directly interacting with the tails , we expect that the pressure in the radio - emitting plasma will be comparable to the pressures in the tail .",
    "the radio filaments are marginally resolved in our highest - resolution radio images , with radii of 12 arcsec .",
    "we can use observed radio surface brightness per unit length to estimate that they would need to have a radius of @xmath344 ( 0.09 kpc ) for the _ minimum _ pressures to be comparable to the thermal pressure in the tails : this is probably inconsistent with the radio data for the southern filament , and almost certainly inconsistent with the data for the northern filament .",
    "however , if the pressure in the filaments exceeds the minimum pressure by the factor @xmath345 required in the lobes , then the radius must be @xmath346 , 0.8 kpc , for pressure balance with the brighter tail , which is similar to what we observe in the high - resolution radio images .",
    "thus it is plausible that the filaments are produced by direct interaction with the tails , as suggested by their positions ( fig.[442-centre ] ) .",
    "assuming that there are not strong variations in the ratio of magnetic field to electron energy density , the filaments must be overpressured with respect to the lobes in order to be visible at all , and so must be dynamically evolving structures .",
    "a model in which they are associated with the galaxies , which we know to be moving with respect to the radio plasma , is therefore _ a priori _ plausible . since the filaments lie to the sides of the x - ray tails ( fig .",
    "[ 442-centre ] ) they can not simply be a result of compression of the remaining central radio - emitting plasma by the moving galaxies .",
    "it is plausible that they arise in the shear layers between the stripped material in the tails and the external gas .",
    "we have presented _ chandra _ observations of the nearby radio galaxies 3c285 and 3c442a .",
    "the main results of the paper can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the large - scale environments of both sources are groups , consistent with earlier optical results .",
    "the groups have similar x - ray luminosities , physical sizes and @xmath246-model parameters , although the best - fitting temperature for 3c442a s group is hotter .",
    "both sources have elongated , 150-kpc scale excess x - ray emission which aligns with galaxies in the group , and which we refer to as the ridge .",
    "this excess x - ray emission is coincident with the regions in which there is little or no radio emission from the lobes . *",
    "using temperatures and pressures derived from the x - ray observations , we have shown that the pressure in the ridges in both sources , within the errors , is equal to or exceeds any plausible internal pressure in the lobes .",
    "thus the ridges are capable of driving , or having driven , the existing radio lobes out of the central regions of the source .",
    "* we have shown that there is direct quantitative evidence in the case of 3c285 (  [ origin ] ) , and strong qualitative evidence in the case of 3c442a , that the ridges are not the result of an interaction between pre - existing gas and the radio source , but must have arisen independently . in 3c442a , we see hot gas in the process of being stripped from the central interacting galaxies and merging into the larger - scale ridge , suggesting that the ridge has been formed by the stripping of the haloes of the two merging galaxies . in 3c285 , the optical observations strongly suggest that the host galaxy has recently merged with a gas - rich system , and there is a tidal interaction with a more distant galaxy , although there is no evidence that the ridge is currently being fed with hot gas ; it is thus possible ( though by no means required by the data ) that the ridge in 3c285 also has an origin in galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "we argue that interaction with similar elongated structures may be responsible for some of the observed central gaps in the lobes of other radio sources .",
    "a prediction of this picture is that there will be ridge structures in other groups that do _ not _ host large , powerful radio galaxies : so far few of these are known , but the group hosting ngc 5171 @xcite may be a good example . *",
    "our detailed view of the tails of hot gas associated with 3c442a allows us to estimate the mach number and speed of ngc 7237 ( the host of 3c442a ) with respect to the diffuse igm .",
    "we obtain results consistent with detailed modelling of the merger dynamics @xcite .",
    "the properties of the radio filaments at the center of 3c442a are consistent with their being formed by interaction with the tails of the two galaxies in the system . *",
    "the x - ray nuclei of the two sources have spectra that are consistent with what is expected for objects of their emission - line type",
    ". no convincing evidence for x - ray counterparts to compact radio features , such as jets or hotspots , is found , and we have shown that the previously claimed optical counterpart to the e hotspot of 3c285 is unlikely to be associated with the hotspot .",
    "x - ray emission is detected from the region of jet - induced star formation in 3c285 reported by @xcite .",

    "<S> we present _ chandra _ observations of two nearby radio galaxies in group environments , 3c285 and 3c442a . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxies of both sources are involved in mergers with nearby massive galaxies , and the hot gas in the systems is extended along lines joining the interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> both sources show strong evidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence of the radio lobes in these systems , and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoing massive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobes in other objects . for 3c442a , </S>",
    "<S> our observations show that gas is being driven out of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair , and the implied constraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motions with respect to the group - scale hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> the previously known filamentary radio structure in the center of 3c442a may be a result of the interaction between hot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre - existing radio - emitting plasma . in 3c285 , where there is no ongoing galaxy merger </S>",
    "<S> , the powerful radio source is probably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group . </S>"
