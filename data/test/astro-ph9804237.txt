    "at the time of this writing ( december 1997 ) , it has been slightly more than 2 years since the `` lyman break '' technique ( discussed extensively elsewhere , e.g. steidel & hamilton 1993 , steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 , madau et al .",
    "1996 , etc . ) , for isolating large numbers of high redshift ( @xmath1 ) galaxies was demonstrated to work efficiently , based on confirming spectra obtained at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory ( steidel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "galaxies at @xmath3 or greater are no longer terribly surprising , as now the highest redshift galaxy has @xmath4 ( franx et al 1997 ) and it probably wo nt be very long before the @xmath5 barrier is surpassed . however , as exciting as finding distant galaxies can be , the greatest gains for our understanding of the galaxy formation process will come from the feasibility of assembling large samples of galaxies at previously inaccessible redshifts , and to study their properties and distribution with a high level of statistical significance . in view of this",
    ", we have spent the ensuing 2 years compiling a large sample of @xmath1 lyman break galaxies , selected in a consistent manner over a number of relatively large fields .",
    "our aim in carrying out this survey is to obtain @xmath6 redshifts per field in each of 56 fields , each of size 160 square arc minutes or greater .",
    "we anticipate that the present survey will reach completion by the end of 1998 .",
    "our survey for lyman break galaxies continues to be based upon deep ground ",
    "based images obtained in a custom broad  band filter system , @xmath7 . for reliable identification of high redshift galaxy candidates , we have found that long integrations on 4m  class telescopes are required to reach adequate depth and s / n ; most of our images have been obtained at the prime focus of the palomar 5 m telescope , and a high quality data set for a 9  by 9  field of view requires about 12 hours of total integration time ( 7 hours in the @xmath8 band alone ) , or about two good nights of observing .",
    "the identification of candidate @xmath1 galaxies is based upon a combination of the modeling of the spectral energy distributions of high redshift star  forming galaxies , including the effects of the opacity of the galaxy ism and the intergalactic medium ( cf .",
    "madau 1995 ) , and the results of our spectroscopy , which have resulted in a somewhat modified color  selection window as compared to the purely theoretical one which was used originally ( cf .",
    "steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a two  color diagram from one pointing of the palomar 5 m , indicating the region from which we select our samples of lyman break galaxy candidates .",
    "approximately 5% of all galaxies to @xmath9 are candidate high redshift ( @xmath0 ) galaxies .",
    "all of the follow  up spectroscopy has been obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the w.m .",
    "keck telescopes . on a typical slit mask ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath10 spectra of candidate @xmath1 galaxies ; our current configuration generally leads to @xmath11% of the observed galaxies yielding redshifts .",
    "a clear night will yield a total of @xmath12 @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "the current redshift histogram for objects satisfying the color criteria in the shaded region of figure 1 is shown in figure 2 ; about 90% of the galaxies fall in the redshift interval @xmath13 , with none having @xmath14 .",
    "the success of the spectroscopic follow  up , and the well - established redshift selection function for our particular color selection criteria , allow a number of inferences based on the statistics of the larger photometric sample , which at the time of this writing includes @xmath15 lyman break galaxy candidates in a total survey area of about 0.25 square degrees .",
    "for comparison to our earlier results prior to most of the spectroscopy , the surface density of lyman break galaxies having the redshift distribution shown in figure 2 , and brighter than @xmath16 , is 1.0 arcmin@xmath17 , or roughly 2.5 times larger than our initial ( conservative ) estimates of the surface density of high redshift galaxies .",
    "clearly , these numbers are sensitive to the exact color cut adopted , and the choice of limiting magnitude .",
    "we have converged on the color selection region illustrated in figure 1 , and our photometry allows reasonably complete identification of @xmath1 lyman break galaxies to @xmath9 .",
    "we will discuss details of the redshift selection function , and the space density and luminosity distribution of the lbgs , in dickinson et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the combination of the photometry and the follow  up spectroscopy also enables us to attempt an object  by  object extinction correction , by `` de - reddening '' each galaxy to the spectral energy distribution expected for an unattenuated actively star  forming galaxy ( further details and results will be presented in dickinson et al 1998 ) placed at the known redshift . by far the largest uncertainty in doing this is the adopted reddening / extinction model ; as can be seen in figure 3 , the net correction to the _ observed _ population of galaxies in terms of implied star formation rate ranges from a factor of @xmath18 if an smc  like reddening curve is adopted , to a factor of @xmath19 for the assumption that the empirical starburst galaxy extinction law of calzetti ( 1997 ) is more appropriate .",
    "we believe that these two reddening laws probably bracket the `` truth '' , although it will take much more work to establish the importance of extinction with any certainty .",
    "for example , we are in the process of obtaining near  ir spectra ( rest  frame optical ) of a sub - sample of lyman break galaxies ( pettini et al 1998 ) , which will provide a cross - check on the appropriate extinction corrections using the luminosity of nebular emission lines .",
    "frame far ",
    "ir ( observed sub - millimeter ) observations of the same galaxies are obviously of interest .",
    "one of our main goals in undertaking a large survey of galaxies at @xmath1 was to investigate the large  scale distribution of star  forming galaxies at such early epochs .",
    "some of the preliminary results of our spectroscopy have been published in steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in which the implications of a large structure of galaxies at @xmath20 were discussed .",
    "the results of using the photometric sample , together with the well - established redshift selection function , for an analysis of the angular clustering of @xmath1 lyman break galaxies are presented in giavalisco et al ( 1998 ) . a count  in  cells analysis of the survey fields in which we have completed our spectroscopy will appear in adelberger et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the most striking ( and robust ) result at present is that the lyman break galaxies _ must _ be much more clustered than the overall mass distribution on scales of @xmath21 mpc , for any reasonable cosmological model . within the context of cold dark matter models for the formation of structure",
    ", this strong `` bias '' ( we measure an effective linear bias parameter of @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) is expected if the lbgs are tracing relatively massive dark matter halos , with @xmath26 m@xmath27 or greater . in hierarchical models , because halos with such large bias would be expected to be tracing the densest environments at @xmath1 , the lbgs are probably the progenitors of objects that end up in groups and clusters of galaxies by the present day ( governato et al 1998 , wechsler et al 1998 ) . as can be seen in figure 4 ,",
    "large structures in redshift space are relatively common features , as we had asserted in steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; the largest peaks are expected to become coma  like clusters of galaxies by @xmath28 ( see the article by carlos frenk in these proceedings ) .",
    "the co - moving correlation length for lyman break galaxies at @xmath29 is @xmath30 mpc for @xmath31 ; note that this is as large or larger than that of present  day galaxies .",
    "this fact points out the danger in interpreting the evolution of galaxy correlation functions from deep redshift surveys as being indicative of the overall growth of structure by gravitational instability ; samples of galaxies at generally _ smaller _ redshifts have much smaller co  moving correlation lengths ( carlberg et al 1997 , le fvre et al 1996 ) .",
    "this probably results from the complicated and model  dependent interplay between effective linear bias of halos in which galaxies have formed , and the ( photometric ) observational biases imposed by the means by which the galaxies were selected , all of which are expected to be redshift ",
    "dependent . in any case",
    ", the paradigm that galaxies form at high peaks in the density field at early epochs that would be biased with respect to the overall mass distribution is strongly supported in our data , and the observations are able to specify the spatial distribution of observable galaxies at early epochs , for comparison to models which include both the dark matter component and recipes for star formation ( e.g. , kauffman 1998 ; frenk 1998 ) .",
    "we are currently exploring more accurate statistics using our growing sample that can be used to test various flavors of hierarchical models . at present , combining information on the clustering properties _ and _ the observed abundance of lbgs constrains the shape of the power - spectrum from galaxy to cluster scales , and favors a universe with low overall matter density within the context of cdm models ( adelberger et al 1998 ) .",
    "it also suggests a very tight relationship between dark matter halo mass and uv luminosity .",
    "we hope to have much more to say on such matters in the very near future .",
    "in the process of obtaining the data for the @xmath3 sample , we have recently begun exploring the use of lyman break color selection for a higher redshift sample , with an expected median redshift @xmath33 . in this case , the color selection is accomplished simply by adding an observed @xmath34 band ( @xmath35  ) for those fields in which we already have deep @xmath36 and @xmath37 images . in order to make strong claims about possible evolution of the star forming galaxy populations between @xmath1 and @xmath38 , it will be essential to establish an accurate redshift selection function .",
    "our initial forays into the spectroscopy of such candidates have been very instructive .",
    "first , it certainly does work to use similar color  selection for this higher redshift range ( at the time of this writing",
    "we have confirmed 10 redshifts in the range @xmath39 ) , but it will be _ far _ more difficult to obtain large galaxy samples at these redshifts as compared to @xmath1 .",
    "this is partly due to a real decline in space density at a given luminosity ( our preliminary indications are that the abrupt decline beyond @xmath1 as suggested in the hdf [ madau et al .",
    "1996 ] is supported by our ground  based data over much larger fields ) , partly due to a slightly fainter apparent magnitude for a given absolute luminosity , but mostly to the fact that the night sky background becomes much more troublesome when the lines which one generally uses to secure the redshifts appear much farther to the red .",
    "one of the consequences is that galaxies without strong lyman @xmath40 emission lines are exceedingly difficult to identify securely .",
    "it is clear that galaxies at very early epochs ( the first 10% of the age of the universe ) are now open to the kinds of wholesale , statistical studies that will provide significant constraints on models of galaxy and structure formation .",
    "issues that have clearly arisen at this meeting as being very important are 1 ) to what extent is dust altering our view of star formation in early galaxies , and therefore our census of the global star formation history of the universe ?",
    "2 ) what are the clustering properties of early galaxies really telling us about cosmological world models and/or how the galaxy formation process works ?",
    "3 ) what are the present day descendents of star forming galaxies seen at very high redshift , and more generally how do objects observed at one cosmic epoch relate to those observed at another ?",
    "4 ) how are dark matter halos and observable galaxies related to one another ?",
    "the rapid developments on both observational and theoretical fronts , many of which have been discussed at this meeting , will almost certainly lead to a great deal of progress on these and other fundamental questions in just the next few years .",
