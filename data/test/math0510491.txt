    "we are interested in extensions of roth s theorem on arithmetic progressions in dense sets of integers to a two - dimensional , finite - field setting .",
    "specifically , for a finite group @xmath9 define the quantity @xmath10 to be the cardinality of the largest subset of @xmath11 containing no _",
    "corner_. a _ corner _ is triple of points of the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "while this concept is most interesting in the context of the groups @xmath14 , it already makes sense  and is substantial  in the context of finite fields . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the case of @xmath15 . here and throughout this paper",
    "we write @xmath16 .",
    "[ mainthm ] @xmath17 .",
    "this bound is an improvement , in the setting of @xmath18 , of the bounds provided by shkredov @xcite , and as simplified by ben green @xcite .",
    "the main point is that we elaborate on the ` density increment ' procedure , obtaining a density increment on a set which is the intersection of sublattices in two distinct sets of bases .",
    "our theorem is an example of the quantitative bounds on questions of arithmetic combinatorics .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers of gowers @xcite , and surveys by t.  tao @xcite and ben green @xcite for more history .",
    "erds and graham raised the question of quantitative bounds for @xmath19 , and this question was raised again by gowers @xcite .",
    "ajtai and szemerdi @xcite first proved that @xmath20 .",
    "furstenberg and katznelson @xcite gave a far reaching extension , though their method of proof does not in and of itself permit explicit bounds .",
    "solymosi @xcite , and v.  vu @xcite provided such bounds , although of a weak nature .",
    "i.  shkredov @xcite provided the first ` reasonable ' bounds .",
    "we are using his ingenious argument , as explained and simplified by ben green @xcite in the finite field setting .",
    "in particular green showed that one could achieve an estimate in which @xmath21 decreased like @xmath22 where @xmath23 could be taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "we find an additional extension of this argument , and sharpen some inequalities to obtain our theorem .",
    "we comment that ` the finite field thesis ' holds that questions of this type should first be studied in the context of finite fields .",
    "this is because one can implement many of the tools of analysis , e.g.  convolution and fourier transform , in that setting .",
    "in addition , one has the powerful concept of being able to pass to appropriate affine subspaces .",
    "moreover , there are a range of methods that one can use to ` lift ' the finite field argument to @xmath25 .",
    "see papers by bourgain @xcite , green and tao @xcite and shkredov @xcite for more information .",
    "one of us ( m.l . ) was supported in part by the nsf and the guggenheim foundation .",
    "one of us ( w.m . ) was supported in part by a vigre grant awarded to georgia institute of technology .",
    "both authors are grateful for the hospitality of the university of british columbia . while there , we benefited greatly from conversations with izabella aba and jozef solymosi .",
    "ben green and i.  shkredov pointed out an error in an earlier version of this paper .",
    "we also thank the referee for additional corrections , which lead to strengthening of the main result .",
    "ben green has provided a comprehensive outline of the method of proof @xcite , so we will be somewhat brief .",
    "let @xmath26 .",
    "it is natural to count the expected number of corners that @xmath27 has .",
    "this expectation will be approximately what it should be if the ` box norms ' of @xmath27 are small .",
    "these norms , we use three of them , are explicitly given in ( [ e.box])([e.boxnormyd ] ) , and are a two dimensional analog of the ` combinatorial square ' norms that play such a prominent role in the proof of roth s theorem @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a certain measure of ` uniformity . '",
    "an important difference between our approach and the previous ones is that we emphasize the role of three distinct coordinates in the problem .",
    "two of these are the obvious @xmath28 and @xmath29 coordinates , given by the canonical basis @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the third is the _ diagonal _ coordinate @xmath32 , given by @xmath33 . in this way , our argument resembles the ergodic theoretic arguments , and in particular that of conze and lesigne @xcite who describe the characteristic factor for the ergodic averages @xmath34 where @xmath35 are commuting measure preserving transformations .",
    "two of the three box norms employ this diagonal coordinate .",
    "either being large is an ` obstruction to uniformity . '",
    "( see @xcite . ) but , in contrast to the case of roth s theorem , this obstruction to uniformity has no clear arithmetic consequence .",
    "it does imply , however , that the set @xmath27 has an increased density on a sublattice .",
    "that is , there is a subsets @xmath36 , of relatively large density , for which @xmath27 has a larger density on the _ intersection of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , _ where in the latter product , we are taking the product in the coordinate system @xmath39 .",
    "see lemma  [ increment ] .",
    "forming the intersection of two sublattices in this way is the main new contribution of this paper .",
    "it was a significant insight of shkredov @xcite that ( 1 ) one could , after an additional argument , assume that @xmath40 , @xmath29 and @xmath32 had an arithmetic structure , namely that it was _ uniform _ in the sense of ( [ e.uni ] ) , see lemma  [ uniformity ] ; and ( 2 ) the box norm could still be used as an ` obstruction to uniformity ' if @xmath40 , @xmath29 and @xmath32 were uniform .",
    "this is the content of the lemma  [ gvn ] .",
    "if there is an obstruction to uniformity , an increment in the density of @xmath27 can be found .",
    "one can find the obstruction to uniformity only a finite number of times , else the density of @xmath27 would exceed one .",
    "thus at some point , there would be no obstruction to uniformity , and so @xmath27 would have a corner .",
    "all of the details of the proof are below .",
    "we will let @xmath41 denote a subspace .",
    "the dimension of this subspace will decrease in the course of the proof .",
    "@xmath42 denote subsets .",
    "we adopt the notations of probability and expectation with respect to the counting measure on @xmath43 .",
    "we view @xmath28 as a subset of the first coordinate associated to basis element @xmath30 ; @xmath29 as a subset of the second coordinate , associated to basis element @xmath31 ; and @xmath32 as a subset of the ` diagonal ' coordinate associated to @xmath44 .",
    "we will be working with subsets of @xmath45 it is to be emphasized that the products are taken in the first instance in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coordinates ; the second in the @xmath30 and @xmath46 coordinates .",
    "write _ the density of @xmath28 in @xmath47 _ as @xmath48 and similarly for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the iterative procedure used in this proof",
    ", these densities will be decreasing , somewhat rapidly . throughout this paper",
    "we will not only be concerned with the density of the subsets @xmath40 and @xmath32 , but also with how ` uniformly distributed ' they are in @xmath43 .",
    "a quantification of this quality comes in the following definition : @xmath51 this definition only makes sense relative to a subspace @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath52 then we say that @xmath40 is _",
    "@xmath53uniform_. here @xmath54 represents the the fourier transform of @xmath40 which is defined as follows , in which @xmath55 is a second root of unity : @xmath56    it is immediate from the definition that a translate of a uniform set by an element of @xmath47 is again uniform . after the deletion of a small subset ,",
    "a uniform set is again uniform .",
    "let @xmath57 , we have @xmath58    this proposition will be used repeatedly .",

    "the proposition follows from plancherel , and the definition of uniformity .",
    "a form of this inequality that we will use several times is this : for any two sets @xmath62 , @xmath63 that is , only uniformity in one coordinate is required .",
    "now , @xmath64 is as in ( [ e.sdef ] ) , and let @xmath65 .",
    "write _ the density of a _ as @xmath66 this quantity will increase in the iterative procedure used in the proof .",
    "we define the _ balanced function _ of @xmath27 to be the function supported on @xmath67 as @xmath68    our standing assumption will be @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a large constant which we need not specify exactly , as its precise value only influences implied constants in our main theorem . in the proofs of lemmas , we will use the notation @xmath71 for a fixed , but unimportant , function of @xmath72 , that tends to zero as @xmath72 does .",
    "further , for a function @xmath73 , define the following norm @xmath74 where we use the standard basis @xmath75 .",
    "this norm averages ` cross correlations ' of @xmath76 over all boxes in @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath76 is the balanced function of @xmath78 , the norm being ` large ' is an obstacle to @xmath78 having the correct number of corners .",

    "the point of these next propositions is that the quantities introduced above behave as they should , under the assumption of uniformity . in particular ,",
