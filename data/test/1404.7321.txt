    "the present contribution focuses on the dynamics of particles and their accumulation in electro - osmotic flow through micro - channel junctions which are a basic element of microfluidic systems .",
    "this work thus extends previous studies @xcite that focused on describing the interesting hydrodynamic behavior , wherein beyond a critical level of external - field intensity , vortices are observed to appear within the flow around ( sharp ) corners of micro - channel junctions .",
    "the generation of such vortices is potentially useful in certain applications as a means to enhance and control micro - fluid mixing @xcite . in other situations",
    "the appearance of vortices may need to be suppressed so as to avoid accumulation of suspended particles leading to the eventual jamming of the device @xcite . in linear electro - osmosis , when the equilibrium zeta potential is uniform and independent of the external field , the resulting flow is irrotational .",
    "however , the small yet finite polarizability of the walls gives rise to an additional , non - linear , electro - kinetic mechanism termed induced - charge electro - osmosis ( iceo ) @xcite .",
    "when an external field is applied to the system , it sets off within the electrolyte solution transient ohmic currents which create a non - uniform charge cloud near the walls .",
    "thus , a non - uniform distribution of induced zeta potential is established whose magnitude is proportional to the external - field intensity .",
    "the helmholtz - smoluchowski slip velocity at the fluid - solid interface resulting from the interaction of the electric field and the induced - charge cloud is non - linear in the applied field and generates an electro - osmotic flow which is not necessarily irrotational .",
    "thamida & chang @xcite pointed out that the above mechanism produces opposite polarization of the respective upstream and down - stream faces of the corner .",
    "furthermore , for a sufficiently strong external field this iceo not only dominates the local flow near the corner but produces downstream macro - scale vortices as well @xcite .",
    "thamida & chang @xcite also observed that an interesting colloid accumulation occurs at the corner , however no attempt was made to address this particle trapping mechanism either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "as will be shown herein , the rapid trapping occurs due to a combination of the short range dep trapping force and the long - range induced electro - osmotic flow which feeds the particles .",
    "previous studies have examined particle trapping and separation based on insulator - based dielectrophoresis ( idep ) using sharp tips among other geometries @xcite . however , in contrast to the current study , these works have treated such structures as insulators and as a result induced electrokinetic effects , emanating from the finite but small dielectric polarizability of the wall materials , were overlooked .",
    "nevertheless , efficient trapping via the combination of a short range dep force and far - field hydrodynamics has been shown for a variety of flow generation mechanisms .",
    "ac electroosmosis ( aceo ) , which uses electrodes embedded within the microchannel , has attracted a lot of attention as means for vortex generation and particle trapping through hydrodynamic forces that focus the particles into the stagnation point of the vortices @xcite . additionally , similar accumulation has recently been demonstrated @xcite at the stagnation points of electro - osmotic vortices of the second kind formed at the interface of a microchannel and a wide nanoslot .",
    "it is thus the focus of the current study to provide for the first time a thorough explanation , based on both theory and experiments , for the rapid particle trapping due to the combined forces of the dep and iceo vortex at the corner of a microchannel . in the following ,",

    "[ fig : asymmetry experimental ] ) where particles were not observed to be trapped upstream of the corner in the case of the field pointing from the narrow to wide channels ( i.e. @xmath84 ) , in contrast to the immense trapping occurring in the opposite direction .",
    "inset ( c ) here resembles fig .",
    "4(c ) in @xcite in the sense that an upstream vortex may develop , except that the same flow pattern occurs at yet larger @xmath90 values ( or equivalently larger electric fields ) .",
    "the difference in the @xmath109 ( bottom ) boundary condition ( h - s slip condition at the wall instead of a symmetry line ) delays the flow reversal within the narrow channel upstream of the corner , resulting from the continuity of the mass flow rate , which is necessary for obtaining the downstream vortex .",
    "here we use the following quantities : @xmath110 is the vacuum permittivity ; @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the relative dielectric constants of the fluid and microchannel ( pdms ) , respectively ; @xmath113 is the universal gas constant ; @xmath114 is the absolute temperature ; @xmath115 is the faraday constant ; @xmath116 is the bulk ionic concentration ; @xmath117 is the narrow channel width ; @xmath118 is the particle radius ; @xmath119 ( obtained for di , i.e. @xmath120@xcite ) and @xmath121 ( measured ) are the conductivities of the particle ( effective conductivity due to surface conduction ) and medium ; the zeta potential of the pdms can be estimated as@xcite @xmath122 for ph@xmath1235.5 ( measured ) while that of polystyrene particles @xmath124 ( measured using zetasizer for 1 mm particles in @xmath125 solution , @xmath126 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath127 is the debye length . using the following expressions : @xmath128 , @xmath129 ( wherein the tilde stands for the dimensional zeta - potential ) and @xmath130 then for a value of @xmath131 ( corresponding to the case when the combined effect of all competing mechanisms is most clearly seen experimentally in fig.3 ) :    @xmath132    @xmath133    interestingly , the ratio @xmath134 is in agreement with the theoretical analysis wherein",
    "a ratio of the @xmath135 was used .",
    "these values are smaller by factors of @xmath1239 and @xmath1235 than the theoretical values of @xmath96 and @xmath101 ( fig.6 ) , corresponding to the case when all competing mechanisms exist simultaneously to obtain qualitatively the combined effect observed experimentally at high applied fields ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "such a discrepancy is not unexpected in the very crude estimates of scaling analysis .",
    "however , one plausible explanation for this could be that while dep , icep and ep are local effects ( the former two are non - negligible only at the vicinity of the corner while the latter depends only on the local electric field ) the electroosmotic flow must obey the continuity equation ( i.e. mass flux balance ) everywhere in the system .",
    "thus , it is more prone to disturbances , .e.g reservoir - microchannel entrance effects inducing back pressure which may lower the net eof flow , resulting , in better agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "the purpose of the present contribution is to study the colloid dynamics in conjunction with appearance of iceo vortices in a micro - channel junction configuration .",
    "our main experimental results appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : particle - aggregation - plots ] where we demonstrate the rapid particle trapping and accumulation at the vicinity of the corner.the exact nature of the interparticle forces [ e.g. posner 2009@xcite ] existing at the corner vicinity when the particle accumulation becomes significant is beyond the scope of the current study as we are mainly concerned with the physical mechanism that is responsible , in the first place , for the migration of particles towards the corner where they can potentially accumulate .",
    "this phenomenon was shown theoretically , at the single particle level , to be due to the combination of a short - range non - divergence free dep trapping force which is assisted by a far - field electro - convection downstream vortex that feeds the corner with particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gilads - fields ] ) .",
    "the analytical model is a local approximation of the global solution in the vicinity of the corner .",
    "accordingly , the resulting expressions involve no indeterminate parameters whose evaluation would require the use of various ad hoc estimates , in particular with respect to obtaining a correct description of the dielectrophoretic contribution to the particle velocity superposed on the iceo and linear flow velocities .",
    "finally , we clearly demonstrate that the sharp corner geometry , in addition to its potential to greatly enhance forced convection due to the intensified velocity near the channel walls around the induced vortex , can also be used for rapid trapping of colloids .",
