    "the interest in studying record events in a general sense is evident as they by definition tend to be rare events of a special nature . as examples of record - breaking events",
    "most readers might think about athletic records like a world record in 100 m dash , or long jump @xcite .",
    "however records also play an important role in other naturally occurring and man - made phenomena .",
    "in particular , climatic records attract much attention and are frequently mentioned in the media in the context of global warming .",
    "the statistics of record temperatures , precipitation amounts and floods have been adressed extensively in recent work @xcite .",
    "also in evolutionary biology record events have a certain relevance as was pointed out in @xcite , and they play an important role in the dynamics of disordered systems like spin glasses and dirty superconductors @xcite .",
    "last but not least records can be studied in the financial sciences , e.g. when considering record - breaking values or changes in stock prices @xcite . in all these examples not",
    "only the rate of record events is of interest but also their correlations : given that a record flood just occurred , can one relax because it will take a while before the next record flood is to be expected ?",
    "based on our previous work in @xcite , this question will be addressed in the present paper .",
    "most previous studies of record events and record values @xcite have been restricted to the case where the underlying random variables ( rv s ) @xmath0 are independently drawn from a common distribution @xmath1 ( i.i.d .",
    "rv s ) . in this case",
    ", record events can be shown to be stochastically independent , i.e. the knowledge about previous record events does not indicate whether a future record event is more or less likely .",
    "however in many applications , the underlying random variables are not i.i.d .",
    "for example , in recent work majumdar and ziff computed the statistics of records in a symmetric random walk @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here , record events are obviously not independent : in a random walk the probability for a second record to occur immediately after after a previous record is simply @xmath2 , whereas the unconditional probability for a record in the @xmath3th step is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider correlations between records in sequences of rv s that are independent but not identically distributed .",
    "an important example is the statistics of hot or cold records in weather data . in @xcite",
    "the occurrence of record - breaking temperatures in european and american weather recordings was analyzed by modeling daily temperature measurements as uncorrelated rv s with a linear drift .",
    "it was shown that the increase of hot records and the decrease of cold records due to global warming can be described and quantified by this model .",
    "we will refer to this particular example of non - i.i.d .",
    "rv s , which was originally introduced in the 1980 s in the context of athletic records @xcite , as the linear drift model ( ldm ) .",
    "the precise definition of the ldm is as follows : for a positive constant @xmath5 , each random variable @xmath6 has an i.i.d .",
    "part @xmath7 with density @xmath1 and an additive linear drift such that @xmath8 in other words , while the shape of the density @xmath9 of the @xmath10 rv is invariant , its overall position is shifted by a constant amount @xmath5 each time a new rv is drawn . as was already noted in @xcite , the record events under this model",
    "are not in general independent ( see also @xcite for the related case of rv s with changing variance ) . below we shall see that the sign and magnitude of correlations depend in a highly non - trivial way on the underlying probability density @xmath1 . to quantify the correlations , consider the joint probability @xmath11 of a record occurring in the @xmath12 as well as in the @xmath13 step , @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to normalize this joint probability , we divide by the probabilities @xmath15 and @xmath16 of records in the @xmath13 and @xmath17 steps , obtaining the key quantity under consideration throughout this paper , @xmath18     correlations between record events in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 rv for different distributions of the underlying i.i.d .",
    "part . for the gumbel case ,",
    "the well known stochastic independence of record events is found , while simulations for the other distributions show that generally the records are correlated .",
    "note in particular the curve for the symmetric lvy - stable distribution with index @xmath21 , which indicates an attraction between record events . ]    the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ rec_dep ] illustrate two known results , the fact that record events for i.i.d .",
    "rvs are stochastically independent @xcite ( all curves meet at unity for @xmath22 ) , and that for the ldm with gumbel distributed i.i.d . part , record events are stochastically independent for all values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however the curves for other distributions show that stochastic independence does not hold in general .",
    "for some choices of the underlying probability density @xmath1 record events tend to repel each other ( @xmath23 ) , wheras in other cases the correlations are positive , i.e. record events attract each other ( @xmath24 ) . in particular this last , somewhat counterintuitive numerical finding triggered our interest in this problem .    in the next section",
    "we will derive a general expression for the correlations between record events as quantified by @xmath25 .",
    "for this we employ methods similar to those used in @xcite . in section [ examples ] , we provide some explicit examples illustrating the rich and counterintuitive behavior of the correlations . in particular , we discuss the behavior of correlations with respect to the three classes of extreme value statistics @xcite .",
    "we find that while in the weibull class of distributions with finite support the correlations are generally negative , positive correlations mainly arise when the rv s are in the frecht class of distributions with power law tails . in the intermediate gumbel class of distributions with exponential - like tails correlations",
    "can be both positive and negative . finally in section [ conclusions",
    "] , we summarize our results and discuss possible applications and open questions .",
    "consider a sequence @xmath26 of independent but not necessarily identically distributed rv s , with @xmath27 denoting the probability density of @xmath28 .",
    "the probability that the maximum of the first @xmath3 rv s is smaller than a given value @xmath29 then factorizes into the probabilities of the rv s individually being less than @xmath29 , @xmath30=\\prod_{l=1}^{n}\\int^x{\\mathrm{d}}x ' f_{l}(x')=\\prod_{l=1}^{n}f_l(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the cumulative distribution function for the density @xmath27 , and the omitted lower ( upper ) integral boundary is understood to be the lower ( upper ) bound of the support of @xmath32 respectively . throughout",

    "part @xmath28 in ( [ ldm ] ) .",
    "it then follows that @xcite @xmath40 and similarly @xmath41      the expressions ( [ joint ] ) and ( [ joint_ldm ] ) allow us to verify two known results : both for the i.i.d .",

    "part @xmath28 , record events are independent .",
    "we start with the i.i.d .",
    "first note that the probability that the @xmath13 rv is a record is the probability that it is the largest among @xmath3 equivalent rv s , so by symmetry @xmath42 . for the i.i.d .",
    "case , the subscripts in ( [ joint ] ) can be dropped . using the substitution @xmath43 and @xmath44 , one obtains @xmath45 it is possible to insert an arbitrary spacing between the two record events and still obtain this factorization to yield @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , one can consider more than one record event .",
    "the factorization property implies that in the i.i.d .",
    "case , record events are stochastically independent @xcite .",
    "next we consider the ldm with gumbel distributed i.i.d .",
    "part , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "using that in this case @xcite @xmath49 the substitution @xmath43 used above yields @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 again one can introduce an arbitrary number of spaces and intermediate records and still have the corresponding joint probability factorize .",
    "this implies that for the ldm with gumbel distributed i.i.d .",
    "part , as for arbitrary distributions without drift , record events are stochastically independent .      as shown above , for the i.i.d .",
    "case @xmath53 , record events are independent . on the other hand , for very large drift , almost every rv is a record , and thus trivially @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ rec_dep ] ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath56 in between these two limits is not as easily characterized . in particular , while for some probability densities the records seem to repel each other for intermediate @xmath5 ( @xmath57 ) , for other probability densities the records seem to _ attract _ ( @xmath24 )",
    ".     correlations between record events as the number of rv s @xmath3 increases . for the i.i.d .",
    "part drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath58 , the correlations are negative and for sufficiently large @xmath3 tend to a limiting form . for the symmetric lvy distributed i.i.d .",
    "part , the correlations are positive and increase with @xmath3 . ]",
    "figure [ no_fse ] shows examples for both types of behavior , illustrating in addition how the correlations evolve with increasing @xmath3 for the cases of lvy and gauss distributed i.i.d",
    ". parts . clearly , the correlations are not a finite size effect , but their @xmath3-dependence is markedly different in the two cases . for the gaussian case ,",
    "the correlations are negative and seem to approach a form independent of @xmath3 . for the lvy case , on the other hand , the correlations seem to increase with @xmath3",
    ". we will argue later that the correlations eventually become @xmath3-independent also for heavy - tailed distributions , but this limit is approached much more slowly than in the gaussian case .",
    "a first step towards understanding the behavior of the correlations is to determine the sign with which the curves in figs.[rec_dep ] and [ no_fse ] depart from the i.i.d .",
    "case @xmath22 . to address this question",
    ", we compute the record rate @xmath59 and the joint probability @xmath60 in the limit of small @xmath5 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the standard deviation or some other measure of the width of the distribution . for the record rate",
    "this problem was discussed extensively in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . knowing that @xmath42 , a taylor expansion for small @xmath5 yields @xmath63 where we have defined the quantity used in @xcite .",
    "the integral ( [ i(n ) ] ) also appears in the analysis of the density of near - extreme events @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath64 in the same small @xmath5 regime we can also easily determine the joint probability of occurrence of two consecutive records @xmath65 . to leading order in @xmath5 , the expansion of eq.([joint_ldm ] ) yields @xmath66 the first term can be evaluated by partial integration to @xmath67 , and another partial integration yields @xmath68 in addition to the zeroth order term @xmath67 , we find a positive and a negative correction term that describe the effect of the drift .",
    "depending on which one of these two terms is larger , positive or negative correlations will result .",
    "a similar expansion can be set up for the normalized correlation @xmath25 defined in eq.([lnn ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath69 a straightforward computation yields @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\     & & -\\frac{n^2(n-1 ) } { 2}i(n-2)-\\frac{(n-1)^2(n-2)}{2}i(n-3 )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , both positive and negative terms occur in ( [ taylor_mid ] ) , the relative magnitude of which depends explicitly on the underlying probability density @xmath1 .",
    "thus from ( [ taylor_mid ] ) , it is not at all obvious how the counterintuitive positive correlations observed numerically arise , how their occurrence depends on the properties of @xmath71 and how the clustering of record events behaves as a function of the number @xmath3 of rv s considered . before turning to the explicit evaluation of @xmath72 in section [ examples ] ,",
    "we provide some heuristics on the asymptotics of the correlations in the limit of very large @xmath3 , and address the behavior of correlations between rv s that are more than one time step apart .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ pn_ldm ] ) and ( [ joint_ldm ] ) that the asymptotic behavior of the record rate @xmath73 and the joint probability @xmath74 hinges on the existence of the function @xmath75 which was rigorously examined by ballerini and resnick . in @xcite , they prove that the limit ( [ g_limit ] ) exists and is nonzero whenever the density @xmath1 has a finite first moment . for completeness",
    "we provide a heuristic version of their argument .",
    "taking the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ g_limit ] ) one has to consider the convergence of the series @xmath76 now @xmath77 and for any finite @xmath29 and @xmath78 there is a @xmath79 large enough such that @xmath80 .",
    "therefore @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a finite sum and the logarithms in the remaining series were approximated by their taylor expansion around unity .",
    "the condition for @xmath1 to have a finite first moment is that @xmath83 decays faster than @xmath84 , which implies convergence of the infinite series in ( [ rest ] ) and hence of @xmath85 ( in the opposite case the series diverges to @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "since @xmath85 is a probability , it is bounded from above by unity and it follows from ( [ pn_ldm ] ) and ( [ joint_ldm ] ) that @xmath88 and @xmath89 have finite , non - zero limits for @xmath90 .",
    "the same statement then applies to the ratio ( [ lnn ] ) .",
    "although the focus of this paper is on the case of a positive drift which enhances the occurrence of ( upper ) records , it is instructive to compare the asymptotic behavior for @xmath78 described above to the case @xmath91 . for negative drift",
    "both the record rate @xmath73 and the joint probability @xmath74 vanish for @xmath90 , and they do so more rapidly than their i.i.d .",
    "counterparts . the asymptotic behavior of the ratio ( [ lnn ] ) is then _ a priori _ undetermined .",
    "we consider a simple example where the quantities of interest can be computed explicitly .",
    "let the probability density of the i.i.d .",
    "variables be given by the negative exponential distribution , @xmath92 and @xmath93 elsewhere .",

    "we also note that because @xmath186 for @xmath183 , the normalized correlations are confined to lie between 0 and 1 in this case .",

    "the results of the preceding subsections can be summarized in a simple scaling picture .",

    "this time scale diverges for @xmath98 according to @xmath189 ignoring for the moment the logarithmic factor in the gumbel case , these behaviors can be further simplified by expressing the different universality classes in terms of the generalized pareto distribution @xcite @xmath190 for @xmath191 this is of pareto type with @xmath192 , for @xmath193 it reduces to a weibull - type distribution similar to ( [ kuramaswamy ] ) with @xmath194 , and the gumbel class is represented by the exponential distribution which arises from ( [ genpareto ] ) for @xmath195 . using this representation , the different cases in ( 45 ) , ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) reduce to @xmath196",
    "note that @xmath197 in the weibull class but @xmath198 in the frchet class , which explains the slow convergence to the @xmath90 limit in the latter case .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the integral ( [ i(n ) ] ) behaves for large @xmath3 as ( see also @xcite ) @xmath199 to relate this to the behavior of the correlations , we note that for large @xmath3 eq.([taylor_mid ] ) can be approximately written as @xmath200 inserting ( [ i(n)scal ] ) we thus conclude that , to leading order , @xmath201 which correctly reproduces both the sign and the order of magnitude of the correlations derived in section [ examples ] for the weibull and frchet classes : correlations are positive ( negative ) for @xmath191 ( @xmath193 ) , and they scale sublinearly ( superlinearly ) with @xmath3 in the two cases .",
    "a similar calculation using the refined estimate ( [ igumbel ] ) of @xmath202 for the gumbel class shows that the correlations are negative ( positive ) for @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) , in agreement with ( [ jgumbel ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations of @xmath25 with @xmath205 for six different distributions . in each case",

    "the gaussian distribution @xmath25 is clearly negative for @xmath78 and it decreases with growing @xmath3 . at some @xmath207 the correlations become independent of @xmath3 .",
    "for the special case of the exponential distribution we find a constant value of @xmath25 which is only slightly larger than unity .",
    "both the stretched exponential ( with @xmath208 ) and the pareto distributions ( with @xmath209 ) show positive correlations .",
    "note the slow convergence for the pareto distribution with @xmath210.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "in this paper we analyzed the effect of a linear drift on the correlations between records drawn from series of independent rv s , as quantified by the normalized joint probability @xmath116 . in section 2",
    "we derived general expressions ( exact and approximate ) for @xmath116 and recalled the fact that records are independent both for i.i.d .",
    "rv s ( @xmath121 ) and in the special case where the rv s are drawn from the gumbel distribution .",
    "our main analytic results were obtained in section 3 by way of an expansion in the small @xmath5 limit , similar to the approach developed previously in @xcite . using this approach",
    "we were able to show that the correlations are generally negative ( ` repulsive ' ) for distributions in the weibull class , and positive ( attractive ) for distributions in the frchet class . in the gumbel class the sign of the correlations depends on the stretching exponent @xmath211 in ( [ fbeta ] ) , with the border between positive and negative correlations being given by the exponential case @xmath212 .",
    "in contrast to all other cases , for distributions with an exponential tail the correlations are weak and independent of @xmath3 , which is consistent with the fact that this class of distributions also contains the gumbel distribution , which has no correlations at all .",
    "simulation results illustrating the different cases are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] . a special role of the exponential distribution in separating two regimes of qualitatively different behaviors has been noted previously in the related context of near - extreme events @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most surprising and counterintuitive outcome of our work is the discovery of strong positive record correlations for distributions with a power law tail . in view of the substantial interest in detecting and explaining heavy - tailed distributions in all areas of science @xcite",
    ", our finding suggests that drift - induced record correlations could be used as a distribution - free test for detecting power laws or streched exponentials in empirical data @xcite .",
    "an interesting open question concerns the structure of the record correlations in the asymptotic limit @xmath90 , where the record rate approaches a nonzero constant and the record process thus becomes stationary .",
    "based on the work of ballerini and resnick @xcite , we have argued in section [ sec : largen ] that the limit ( [ last ] ) exists for @xmath78 whenever the underlying distribution has a finite mean , whereas for @xmath183 it is possible that @xmath56 diverges for @xmath90 .",
    "the fact that the coefficient of the leading order term in the small @xmath5 expansion generally diverges with @xmath3 indicates that the limiting function @xmath135 may be singular for @xmath98 , and we have presented numerical evidence for the occurrence of a discontinuity at @xmath121 for the weibull class . for heavy - tailed distributions in the frchet class ,",
    "the large-@xmath3 asymptotics is difficult to ascertain numerically because of the slow convergence , but we have argued that in this case @xmath135 may exist also for @xmath91 .",
