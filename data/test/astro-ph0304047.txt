    "the knowledge of the nuclear partition function at high temperatures is essential in understanding the nuclear equation of state used in the core collapse phase of massive stars . in self - consistent simulations , the contraction of the core",
    "is explicitly followed up to nuclear densities , giving rise to extreme temperatures and high mean excitation energies of the nuclei . ratios of high temperature partition functions are also ingredients in nucleosynthesis networks in explosive scenarios , such as the r- and rp - processes .",
    "when employed in nuclear statistical equilibria ( nse ) , they often have to be known at temperatures beyond @xmath4 k.    recently , new sets of partition functions have been published along with astrophysical reaction rates for nuclides from proton dripline to neutron dripline and charge number @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the sets include partition functions up to @xmath6 ( @xmath4 k ) based on two different level densities calculated within a shifted fermi - gas approach @xcite utilizing two mass formulas . here , the extension of these partition functions to temperatures of @xmath7 is presented .",
    "a straightforward extrapolation is not valid because of additional effects acting at high temperatures .",
    "these effects have been a matter of discussion already about 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "the recently improved descriptions of nuclear level density and nuclear reaction rate predictions make it worthwhile to reconsider these arguments and to publish a complete table of partition functions . in this work , in addition to using the more recent level densities of @xcite ,",
    "the corrections are treated by closely following @xcite .",
    "the temperature - dependent partition function @xmath8 normalized to the ground state spin of the nucleus @xmath9 is usually defined as @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the level density and @xmath12@xmath13 the label of the last included experimentally known state .",
    "the sum over boltzmann - weighted discrete states from the ground state to state @xmath14 is performed using experimental levels as listed in @xcite . above the last known state an integration over the nuclear level density",
    "is used instead of a summation , as also outlined in @xcite , employing the level density description of @xcite .",
    "the upper limit @xmath15 of the integration requires special consideration .",
    "formally , the integration procedure should encompass energies up to infinity .",
    "however , for all practical purposes an energy cut - off can be introduced because the boltzmann - factor @xmath16 dominates at high energies and suppresses any further contributions to the integral value .",
    "it is well known that , for instance , the maximum excitation energy above which there are no more significant contributions to the partition function is of the order of @xmath17 mev up to @xmath6 @xcite .    due to the temperature dependence of the integrand in eq .",
    "[ eq : pfunc ] its peak contribution is shifted to higher energies for higher temperatures @xmath18 , thus also requiring a larger cut - off @xmath15 . up to now , there has been no systematic scrutiny of the behavior of the integrand , which also weakly depends on the used level density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : peaks ] , the integrands are plotted , also showing the peak energies and the widths of the peaks for different energies .",
    "the shown energies are in agreement with the mean excitation energies derived by @xcite . in the same manner ,",
    "the cut - off energy of 25 mev , often used for calculating partition functions up to @xmath6 , can be justified .    for @xmath19",
    ", we extract a ( nearly ) quadratic dependence on temperature of the peak energy @xmath20 and a linear dependence of the width @xmath21 of the integrand : @xmath22 the integration cut - off was then set to @xmath23 mev .",
    "due to the exponential increase of the nuclear level density with excitation energy , extremely large partition functions already result at temperatures of a few mev ( temperatures given as energies and in @xmath24 are related by @xmath25 mev ) .",
    "however , it has been realized that a straightforward integration over the level density might overestimate the partition functions .",
    "high excitation energies of the nucleus permit the emission of nucleons and therefore an appropriate fraction of the level density associated with such continuum states should be neglected in the computation of the partition function .",
    "@xcite introduced such high temperature corrections by truncating the integration near the nucleon separation energy and by subtracting continuum scattering states ( which , however , do not act below @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xcite accounted for the suppression of the partition functions by arbitrarily setting the integral cut - off to 25 mev . in a semi - classical calculation",
    ", @xcite showed that @xcite and @xcite largely overestimated the suppression , that a simple truncation of the integral is incorrect , and that partition functions remain large for temperatures as high as @xmath26 .",
    "they find that the corrections are much smaller than given by truncated level density integrals and that the conventional partition functions ( with full integration ) are much closer to their values than values obtained with any of the truncation methods .",
    "the advantage of the description by @xcite , which is based on the independent particle model , is the natural inclusion of both bound and continuum nuclear states . here",
    ", we use a hybrid model by using the level density and partition function descriptions as outlined in sec.[sec : proc ] and applying correction factors derived from the spherical square well approximation of @xcite ( eqs .  7 and 9 in that reference ) but using the same nuclear properties ( nucleon separation energies , nuclear radius ) as in @xcite .",
    "this way , a continuous extension of the partition functions of @xcite is possible .",
    "while the simplicity of the equations is kept , the limitations of the spherical square well approach are partially lifted because , e.g. , the separation energies are taken from experiment or from mass formulas employing more realistic nuclear potentials and accounting for shell and deformation effects .",
    "furthermore , this approach is only used to obtain the relative corrections .",
    "the correction factor @xmath27 is extracted by comparing the uncorrected and the corrected total nuclear partition function of @xcite computed in their spherical square well formalism . while referring the reader to the paper of @xcite for a more complete description of their approach , only the relevant equations are summarized here .",
    "the total nuclear partition function @xmath28 is constructed as the sum of two terms for protons and neutrons , respectively : @xmath29 with @xmath30 the letter @xmath31 stands for neutron ( n ) and proton ( p ) , respectively , and @xmath32 is the neutron number @xmath33 and the proton number @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the ground state energy is denoted by @xmath35 and the inverse nuclear temperature by @xmath36 with @xmath37 mev .",
    "the mean - square number fluctuation @xmath38 , the nuclear contribution @xmath39 ( as opposed to the contribution of the exterior nucleon gas ) of the grand partition function , and the lagrange multiplier @xmath40 can be found with and without continuum contributions , leading to nucleon partition functions @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 and total partition functions @xmath34 , @xmath43 with and without corrections . in the following ,",
    "primed quantities are without corrections .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath44 \\quad,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "q_x = d(t)\\left[f_{3/2}\\left(\\alpha+\\beta s_x+3\\beta x/2\\rho_f\\right)- f_{3/2}\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\right ] \\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 \\quad,\\nonumber \\\\ \\mathfrak{n}=\\frac{3}{4}d(t)\\left[f_{-1/2}\\left ( \\alpha+\\beta s_x+3\\beta x/2\\rho_f\\right)- f_{-1/2}\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\right ] \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fermi integrals of the order @xmath46 with argument @xmath47 are denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "the factor @xmath49 is @xmath50 for consistency , the same particle separation energy @xmath51 is used as for the reaction rate calculations of @xcite .",
    "it is taken either from experiment or from a mass formula where no experimental information is available .",
    "the level density at the zero - temperature fermi surface is given as @xmath52 using the nuclear radius @xmath53 and the nucleon mass @xmath54 .",
    "with that definition the ground state energy becomes @xmath55    before evaluating the above equations , the appropriate ( temperature dependent ) lagrange multiplicators with and without corrections have to be determined .",
    "this is done by requiring states in the grand canonical ensemble to have , on the average , the correct number of nucleons , @xmath32 , and therefore by finding the root of the following equations with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath56 : @xmath57-x&=0 \\quad,\\nonumber \\\\ & \\frac{3}{2}d(t)\\left[f_{1/2}\\left(\\alpha+\\beta s_x+3\\beta x/2\\rho_f\\right)- f_{1/2}\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\right ] -x&=0\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proper @xmath40 or @xmath56 found above has to be inserted also in eq .",
    "[ eq : nucleonpart ] , of course .",
    "finally , the relevant partition function @xmath58 is then obtained by multiplying the previous function ( from sec .",
    "[ sec : proc ] ) with the correction @xmath27 : @xmath59 thus , the correction factor @xmath27 found with the approach above is applied to the partition function derived in the full computation described in sec .",
    "[ sec : proc ] .",
    "the corrections start to act at temperatures @xmath60 for light and intermediate nuclei and as low as @xmath61 for heavy nuclei .",
    "corrections are negligible for @xmath62 , implying that the partition functions from @xcite can be used without further modifications .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections ranges from a few percent at the lower end of the temperature range to a suppression factor of @xmath63 for the heaviest nuclides at @xmath26 and @xmath64 at @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the correction factors for a few selected cases are shown in table [ tab : corr ] .",
    "the corrected renormalized partition functions @xmath65 calculated with level densities utilizing input from the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite ( see also rauscher & thielemann 2000 ) are given in table [ tab : pf_frdm ] .",
    "results making use of the extended thomas - fermi mass formula with shell quenching effects ( etfsi - q ) @xcite ( see also rauscher & thielemann 2000 ) far from stability are given in table [ tab : pf_etfsiq ] .",
    "the properties of the mass formulas can enter via the particle separation energies which are calculated from predicted mass differences in case no experimental masses are known .",
    "furthermore , they always enter in the microscopic correction term used in the level density treatment of @xcite . the method to calculate the high temperature corrections",
    "is only applicable for bound nucleons , therefore only those nuclides are given for which both the neutron and proton separation energies are positive .",
    "the printed version of this paper contains only example tables , showing which kind of information is available .",
    "partition functions for the full range of nuclides from proton dripline to neutron dripline for @xmath66 ( frdm ) and @xmath67 ( etfsi - q ) are available as machine readable tables in electronic form .",
    "the formatting is the same as used in @xcite , except for the different temperature range .",
    "thus , the partition functions presented here provide a smooth and analytical extension of the previous tabulation , extending the range of temperatures to @xmath68    the new values for @xmath69ni can directly be compared to the ones from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ni56 ] shows the partition function of this nucleus . by comparing to fig .  1 in @xcite it can be seen that the new value is higher by 4550% around @xmath70 mev than their corrected value b. this is mainly due to the different level density description ( different effective level density parameter @xmath71 ) used since a similar treatment of the high - temperature corrections is implemented in both calculations .",
    "it has to be noted that the partition functions presented here are valid for low - density conditions . in high - density regimes",
    ", modifications of nuclear properties ( e.g. , separation energies ) might have to be additionally applied .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current investigation .    the nuclear model for the corrections ( and the one for the level density ) assumes a fermi - gas of independent nucleons interacting only through a common , spin - independent mean field . at nuclear temperatures beyond about 30 mev ( i.e.  @xmath72 ) , the momentum dependence of the mean field , the excitation of mesonic degrees of freedom , and the breakdown of the independent particle approximation become important .",
    "this is not relevant for the temperature range explored here but will necessitate an altogether different approach when expanding the temperature range beyond about 2530 mev .",
    "it is expected that the exponential rise of the partition functions with temperature will finally be effectively suppressed beyond those energies .",
