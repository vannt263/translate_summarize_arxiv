    "let us look at the pure spinor superstring theory in expansion around flat space .",
    "the structure of massless brst cohomology in flat space is more or less clear , but it appears that it has never been explicitly spelled out in the literature .",
    "the present paper is aimed at filling this gap .    for the closed _",
    "bosonic _ string the cohomology was computed in @xcite .",
    "we will here do a similar computation for the pure spinor superstring , but with the following difference .",
    "it is well known that the physically relevant cohomology problem is the so - called semirelative cohomology @xcite , which is @xmath1 acting on the vertex operators @xmath2 satisfying the following condition : @xmath3 this condition was built - in into the computations of @xcite . in the pure spinor superstring ,",
    "the construction of the @xmath4-ghost is very subtle . in our paper",
    "we will compute the `` naive '' cohomology of @xmath1 , without taking into account ( [ semirelativecondition ] ) .",

    "nontrivial cohomology at the ghost number three    problems 1 and 2 are removed if we require the existence of the dilaton superfield @xmath5 ( see @xcite and the discussion in section [ sec : commentonnonphysicalstates ] ) .",
    "to defeat the ghost number three cohomology is more difficult .",
    "it is dangerous as a potential obstacle for continuing an infinitesimal solution to a finite solution ( _ i.e. _ obstructed deformations of the flat spacetime ) .",
    "such obstructions would render the theory physically inconsistent . in bosonic string ,",
    "all linearized deformations are unobstructed .",
    "one explanation is that the _ semi - relative _ cohomology at the ghost number three is zero , and therefore there is no obstacle .",
    "more precisely , the higher order correction to @xmath2 are controlled by the string field equation @xcite : @xmath6 since the ghost number four cohomology is zero , @xmath7 is in the image of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , the pre - image could be chosen to be annihilated by @xmath9 , and this shows that eq .",
    "( [ stringfieldequation ] ) can be resolved order by order in the deformation parameter .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have such a proof in the pure spinor formalism .",
    "it follows from the consistency of @xcite that there is actually no obstacle in extending the infinitesimal deformation to higher orders .",
    "even though the ghost number three cohomology is nonzero , the actual obstruction vanishes for physical states",
    ". it would be good to have a transparent proof of this fact using the language of brst cohomology and vertex operators .",
    "this would probably require the use of the composite @xmath4-ghost .      in the rest of this introductory section we will review general facts about the brst cohomology and its relation to the deformations of the worldsheet sigma - model .",
    "then in section [ sec : typeiibvsmaxwell ] we will review the cohomology of the classical electrodynamics , and explain how to reduce the cohomology of the type iib brst operator in flat space to the cohomology of electrodynamics .",
    "the relation will involve the computation of the cohomology of the algebra of translations with coefficients in the space of solutions of susy maxwell equations ( section [ sec : cohomologyofclassicalelectrodynamics ] ) and the tensor produce of two copies of such spaces ( section [ sec : cohomologyoftensorproduct ] ) .",
    "the results on brst cohomology are summarized in sections [ sec : brstcohomology ] and [ sec : actionofsusy ] .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that classical solutions of the type iib supergravity are in one - to - one correspondence with two - dimensional sigma - models satisfying certain axioms .",
    "most importantly , there should be two nilpotent odd symmetries @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 also , there should be conserved charge known as the `` ghost number '' , with both @xmath10 and @xmath11 having ghost number @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that we are given such a sigma - model .",
    "a natural question is , how can it be deformed ?",
    "deformations of the sigma - model are the deformations of the action : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is some operator . if @xmath15 vanishes on - shell , then such deformation is trivial , as it can be undone by a field redefinition .",
    "suppose that the deformation is non - trivial .",
    "the condition that the deformed action still has a pair of nilpotent symmetries is equivalent to requiring the existence of @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that on - shell : @xmath18 here @xmath19 means `` equivalent on - shell '' , _",
    "i.e. _ `` equivalent modulo the equations of motion '' .",

    "then @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both symmetries of the deformed action ( [ deformationoftheaction ] ) .",
    "actually they are nilpotent : @xmath28 this is automatically true because all those anticommutators would be conserved charges of the ghost number two . in this paper",
    "we study vertices which are homogeneous polynomials of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the conserved charges of the ghost number two are polynomials of low degree . therefore if @xmath15 is of large enough degree in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then the nilpotence condition ( [ anticommutatorautomaticallyzero ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is enough to verify ( [ separateqlandqr ] ) for @xmath31 : @xmath32 conditions ( [ separateqlandqr ] ) and ( [ q ] ) are equivalent , because @xmath33 and @xmath34 are independent , as both left and right ghost number are conserved .",
    "in fact , any linear combination @xmath35 with nonzero constant @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be choosen as a brst operator ; all such complexes are quasi - isomorphic to each other .",
    "operators @xmath15 satisfying the condition ( [ q ] ) are called `` integrated vertices '' .",
    "notice that @xmath38 is a one - form of the ghost number one , and @xmath39 ; this typically and @xmath30 ; some of our results are only valid under the assumption that the degree of the polynomial is large enough ; exceptions may happen for vertices which do not depend on @xmath29 ] implies @xmath41 , because there are no conserved charges of the ghost number two .",

    "this involves the assumption about the vanishing of the cohomology at the nonzero conformal weight requires the absence of local conserved charges with nonzero ghost number ; going back ( from @xmath2 to @xmath15 ) requires the vanishing of the cohomology in the sector with positive conformal dimension ] .",
    "although ( to the best of our knowledge ) the proof of this vanishing theorem has never been given , we feel that the statement is true .",
    "notice that the construction of @xcite establishes the correspondence between integrated and unintegrated vertices independently of this assumption .",
    "although ( in its current form ) it only works in flat space and in @xmath43 , it also teaches us something about the generic curved background .",
    "for example , it tells us that the map @xmath44 is injective . indeed , suppose that existed an integrated vertex @xmath15 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( _ i.e. _ nonzero @xmath15 gives @xmath2 ) .",
    "let us expand such @xmath15 in taylor series around a fixed point in the curved space - time , and take the leading term .",
    "this should give us the flat space vertex .",
    "since the map @xmath44 is injective in flat space , the leading term in @xmath2 should also be nonzero .",
    "this means that , if @xmath2 gets killed , then @xmath15 can not survive either .    in any case , our * working hypothesis * is :    * at the linearized level the deformations of the action are in one - to - one correspondence with the brst cohomology of @xmath31 at the ghost number two      if @xmath15 is an integrated vertex operator , then ( [ deformationoftheaction ] ) defines a deformation of the sigma - model action to the first order in @xmath47 .",
    "it is natural to ask , if the deformation can be continued to higher orders of @xmath47 .",
    "an obstacle can , in principle , arise already at the order @xmath48 . once we deform the action as in ( [ deformationoftheaction ] ) , the brst operator gets deformed : @xmath49 here @xmath50 is such that : @xmath51 where @xmath23 is the sigma - model lagrangian ( the existence of such @xmath50 follows from the fact that @xmath52 is a total derivative on - shell , this is in the definition of an integrated vertex operator ) .",
