    "the high pressure and temperature equation of state ( eos ) and phase diagram of carbon have received considerable attention of late .",
    "recent laser - shock and ramp - compression studies @xcite , together with shock measurements performed with magnetically - driven flyer plates @xcite , have produced data in the range from @xmath3 mbar . in addition , theoretical work on the eos and phase diagram in this same range have yielded predictions which are largely ( though not completely ) in accord with these experimental data @xcite .",
    "these studies were conducted with density functional theory ( dft ) molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "much of this recent focus on the carbon eos , specifically in states of compression reached when starting in the diamond phase , has arisen from the interest of using high density carbon as an ablator material for capsules designed to achieve fusion at the national ignition facility @xcite . while these experimental and theoretical studies have been useful in constraining the eos of carbon for this and related applications , it is crucial to note that the states reached by the ablator in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) are expected to include temperatures in excess of tens of ev @xcite .",
    "such conditions have not yet been sufficiently characterized .    at such high temperatures",
    ", dft - md is extremely challenging to perform , due to the large number of high - lying , partially - occupied single - electron states that must be included for an accurate rendering of the electronic thermal excitations .",
    "indeed , an orbital - free variant of dft - md has been developed and used to handle such high temperature applications @xcite , but as yet , a satisfactory treatment of atomic shell structure in this approach is lacking .",
    "the approach as implemented thus far @xcite is ( somewhat ) reminiscent of a thomas - fermi treatment for the electrons @xcite .",
    "another altogether different approach to describing the electronic structure of the high-@xmath4 plasma state is path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) @xcite . in this approach , unlike in typical implementations of dft , there is no mean - field assumption made for the many - electron problem , and the imaginary time treatment makes high-@xmath4 simulations more efficient to perform than low-@xmath4 simulations .",
    "although assumptions regarding the nodal surface of the many electron density matrix necessarily introduce approximations for the treatment of atomic shells , it is very encouraging that recent work on the c plasma has demonstrated that eos predictions can be made with this method which smoothly interpolate between dft - md results at the lower temperatures and the high-@xmath4 debye - hckel limit @xcite .",
    "the ultra - high pressure regime near @xmath5 has been studied recently as well , using ab initio electronic structure techniques of the dft variety together with a random search method to find the thermodynamically stable crystalline phases at pressures between 10 - 1000 mbar @xcite .",
    "this work extended earlier quantitative studies of the c phase diagram that treated the diamond and bc8 phases up to @xmath6 mbar @xcite .",
    "the random search established the sequence of stable phases to be diamond @xmath7 bc8 @xmath7 ( slight modification of ) simple cubic ( sc ) @xmath7 simple hexagonal ( sh ) @xmath7 face - centered cubic ( fcc ) @xcite .",
    "though these authors did not attempt to predict the details of the c melt curve in these extreme conditions , their analysis using a quasiharmonic description of the phonons for these solid phases suggested the existence of a bc8-sc - sh triple point , as seen in fig .",
    "3 of their manuscript @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , correa et al .",
    "used the available theoretical understanding of the c phase diagram at the time @xcite to produce a three - phase eos model for c focusing specifically on the regime of @xmath8 mbar and @xmath5 - 20,000 k @xcite .",
    "the phases considered were : diamond , bc8 , and the liquid .",
    "the individual phase free energy models were fit to the results of dft - md calculations .",
    "since the final multiphase eos model was designed to be used in hydrocode simulations spanning a wider range of conditions , these researchers embedded their detailed three - phase eos model into a more coarse - grained model @xcite that respected the ideal gas limits at high-@xmath4 and low-@xmath2 and the thomas - fermi limit @xcite at high-@xmath2 . while satisfactory in a broad sense , this older eos model suffers from three main drawbacks : 1 .",
    "the embedding of the dft - based 3-phase model into the coarse - grained model created kinks in the thermodynamic functions , even though an attempt was made to smooth out such features by interpolation .",
    "there are no solid phases beyond bc8 ; sc and sh phases , for instance , are not included .",
    "the electronic excitations of the high-@xmath4 liquid are treated with an average - atom thomas - fermi model , so atomic shell structure is not included in sufficient detail .    in this work",
    ", we remedy these deficiencies by constructing a 5-phase eos for c , again based on ab initio calculations ( for densities between @xmath9 1 - 25 g / cc ) , in which the free energy models for each phase are defined over wide ranges of @xmath2 and @xmath4 and exhibit sensible limiting behavior .",
    "no embedding into a simpler model @xcite is performed .",
    "the two extra phases included are the sc and sh phases .",
    "while our phase diagram differs slightly from that of ref.@xcite , the inclusion of these extra phases allows our eos to be in accord with ab initio predictions for pressures up to well over 100 mbar .",
    "the electronic excitations in the liquid are treated with an average - atom model called purgatorio which , unlike thomas - fermi , includes the treatment of atomic shell structure within a kohn - sham dft framework @xcite . to constrain the ion - thermal model for the liquid ,",
    "we perform dft - md in c up to 100,000 k and pimc caculations @xcite from @xmath9 200,000 k ( depending on the density ) to over @xmath10 k. we establish that the best fit to these eos predictions requires a model in which the decay of the ion - thermal specific heat is much faster than previously expected .",
    "our newly - developed `` cell model '' @xcite , in conjunction with the purgatorio electron - thermal term , provides an excellent fit throughout the range of both the dft - md and the pimc data . in what follows",
    ", we describe the details of our dft and pimc calculations , present the models we use for the free energies of the individual phases , and compare various thermodynamic tracks through our eos with the results of recent experiments performed on high - energy laser platforms @xcite .",
    "our computational results fall into two categories : 1",
    ". calculations of the eos , by which we mean internal energy , @xmath11 , and pressure , @xmath12 , as functions of density , @xmath2 , and temperature , @xmath4 , and 2 . calculations of intermediate quantities we which use to build the eos .",
    "these include cold curves ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 as functions of @xmath2 , for ions fixed in position @xcite ) , phonon densities of states ( pdos ) , and electronic excitation contributions to the free energy . the first category of quantities we extract from dft - md ( for solid and liquid phases ) and pimc ( liquid phase ) .",
    "the second group of quantities we extract solely from dft calculations for the solid phases .",
    "it may seem at first as if our multitude of results overdetermines the eos , particularly in the liquid phase where both dft - md and pimc results reside .",
    "however we find it crucial to make use of this full suite of results ; the approximations inherent in our dft and pimc calculations are altogether different , and it is important to check whether certain features of our results are artifacts of the simulation method or are robust indicators of the true eos of c. this is especially the case for the liquid at high temperatures , where we find ( with both methods ) results which contradict some of our previous assumptions ( see below ) .",
    "fig.[pd_data ] shows the locations of our dft - md and pimc simulation points in the @xmath13-plane .",
    "also shown for reference are our predicted c phase lines , presented and discussed in detail below , as well as portions of five separate isentropes computed from the eos model described in this work .",
    "we stress that while the dft - md results are concentrated entirely in the diamond and liquid phases , we use the aforementioned dft - derived intermediate quantities ( cold curves , pdoss , etc . ) to constrain the eos model for each of the four solid phases considered here .",
    "all of our dft - md and pimc data , consisting of internal energy and pressure at different densities and temperatures , are reproduced in tables contained in the supplementary material . in the following two subsections ,",
    "we describe in detail our approaches to obtaining these data .     and pimc points for higher-@xmath4 .",

    "orbital may be significant and can again be addressed by having all 6 electrons in the valence .    in order to assess the sensitivity of our results to the paw potential chosen , we construct paw potentials with different cutoff radii , which range from 1.1 to 0.8 bohr radii .",
    "the vanderbilt projectors generation scheme is utilized @xcite . as the cutoff radii decrease , in order to maintain and optimize the paw performance ,",
    "we add additional partial waves for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 angular momenta .",

    "our phase lines computed in this work differ only slightly from those in that earlier study .",
    "in particular , the diamond - bc8 transition pressure is slightly lower ; this is due to our diamond and bc8 cold curves being slightly different from those of ref.@xcite ( higher plane wave cutoffs and different pseudopotentials were used here ) .",
    "also , the bc8-phase melt temperature is slightly lower , as evidenced by our comparison to the kechin fits to the carbon melt curves of ref.@xcite to which the eos model of ref.@xcite was fit .",
    "nevertheless , our phase diagram is quite close to that of the older model in the range of its applicability . also shown in fig .",

    "the principal hugoniot of carbon computed with the model is shown as well in fig .",
    "this is defined to be the locus of final states accessible via a planar one - dimensional shock , given a particular assumed initial state , here taken to be @xmath107 3.52 g / cc and @xmath108 300 k. this curve has two branches : one for which the final state is the diamond phase , and one in which the liquid is the final state .",
    "they are separated by a flat region in @xmath4 straddling the pressure at which the diamond @xmath7 bc8 transition is predicted to occur . in this portion of the hugoniot curve",
    "the final state is in a mixed - phase region , the size of which is directly related to the latent heat of melting , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we predict a principal hugoniot which is similar to that predicted by the earlier carbon eos model @xcite ( indeed , it is nearly identical in the diamond - phase portion ) .",
    "however , there is a pronounced increase ( @xmath9 100 gpa ) in the hugoniot final state pressure of the liquid portion , which is explained by the added latent heat of melting resulting from the addition of the purgatorio electron - thermal contribution .",
    "our change in entropy from solid to liquid at constant @xmath55 at the shock melt conditions is @xmath109/atom , while in the model of ref.@xcite it is @xmath110/atom .",
    "this in turn moves our liquid branch of the hugoniot a bit closer to the measured @xmath4 vs. @xmath12 hugoniot data of eggert et al.@xcite ( the upper and lower bounds of their experimental error bars are displayed as well in fig .",

    "the higher-@xmath12 solid phases , sc and sh , appear as well , in addition to diamond , bc8 , and liquid phases .",
    "several important features are worth noting : 1 .",
    "the bc8 @xmath7 sc transition pressure is nearly independent of temperature , as is the case for the diamond @xmath7 bc8 transition pressure .",
    "this is because the relevant moments , @xmath66 , of the pdoss of the phases on either side of each transition are very similar at the densities at which the transitions occur , as discussed above .",
    "the sc @xmath7 sh phase line is less vertical , and curves to lower-@xmath12 for higher @xmath4 , but we do _ not _ predict that this phase line intersects the bc8-sc phase line before intersecting the melt curve .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the prediction of ref.@xcite , which shows a sc - sh phase line which intersects the bc8-sc line at @xmath111 k. though we use similar ab initio and eos modeling methods to theirs , we suspect that their treatment of the @xmath4-dependence of the transition pressure in their gibbs free energy matching prescription is sufficiently different from our approach to produce this discrepancy .",
    "we have checked that alternate ways of fitting our eos data ( cold curves , pdoss and resulting ion - thermal free energy terms ) still give the general phase diagram topology we present here , though we do not discount the possibility that the extreme sensitivity of the phase lines to small changes in the individual phase free energies can render our predictions somewhat inaccurate , especially at these higher pressures where the @xmath112 curves are nearly parallel .",
    "the value of the sc - sh transition pressure at low-@xmath4 is @xmath113 higher than that reported in ref.@xcite , though the position of the bc8-sc transition line is in reasonable agreement between the two studies .",
    "this is likely a result of the use of different pseudopotentials and plane wave convergence criteria .",
    "again , the nearly coincident free energy functions for different phases at high pressures makes the phase lines extremely sensitive to any otherwise subtle changes .",
    "4 . the melt line of the sh phase possesses a maximum at @xmath114 gpa .",
    "this is striking , but is one of the least certain predictions we make in this work ; we have seen that slight changes to our eos model parameters which produce small changes to our liquid free energy ( which are within both our assumed model and dft - md uncertainties ) yield sc melt temperatures which exhibit markedly different behavior .",
    "our reason for favoring this particular eos model parameterization over other nearly equivalent ones can be found in our computation of the ionic diffusivities using the dft - md .",
    "[ diff ] shows two diffusivity isotherms , the lower one for @xmath108 10,000 k and the upper one for @xmath108 20,000 k. a very small ( approaching zero ) diffusivity is indicative of a solid phase .",
    "the ionic diffusivity at 20,000 k shows the expected decrease as @xmath55 decreases , but is otherwise large as expected for a liquid .",
    "the diffusivity at 10,000 k shows a pronounced dip towards zero at a @xmath115 1.2 @xmath56/atom , corresponding to a pressure of roughly 10,000 gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ highpliqp ] ) .",
    "this is a clear indication of solidification , and indeed , the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ pd]b shows a melt curve which attains its maximum ( of just over 10,000 k ) at @xmath116 gpa .",
    "though this provides a nice consistency check on our dft - md - derived c eos model , we caution that the diffusivity calculations were performed in a cell of 64 atoms ( as were the dft - md calculations of eos ) , and solidification can be biased in simulations with small cells of fixed shape @xcite .",
    "the overarching points to be made about our prediction of the phase diagram of c are two - fold : first , our predictions of phase lines are necessarily less accurate the higher the pressure is , for the reasons mentioned directly above .",
    "these inaccuracies are the combined result of the inherent uncertainties in the underlying ab initio electronic structure data , and the deficiencies of eos models which have a finite number of adjustable parameters .",
    "second , the predicted volume changes across such high-@xmath12 phase lines are often exceedingly small ( which is what makes the accurate determination of these transition lines difficult ) .",
    "thus , the least accurate phase lines have a minimal impact on the eos itself ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 at a given @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) .",
