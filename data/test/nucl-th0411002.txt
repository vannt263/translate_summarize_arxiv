    "double beta decay is of a major importance both for particle and nuclear physics . in particular , the lepton number violating neutrinoless mode of double beta decay ( @xmath11-decay ) , forbidden in the standard model(sm ) , touches upon one of the key questions of particle physics : if massive neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles .",
    "as is known this process occurs if and only if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "therefore any experimental observation of @xmath11-decay would be an unambiguous indication of the majorana nature of neutrinos even if neutrino contribution to its rate is negligible in comparison with some other mechanisms related to physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the future double beta decay experiments have realistic chances to observe @xmath11-decay and , thus , to establish the majorana nature of neutrinos , provide an important information on neutrino mass matrix and on the lepton number violating parameters of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the accuracy of the determination of these quantities from the measurements of the @xmath11-decay half - life will be essentially related to our knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements .",
    "therefore , the development of reliable models for calculation of these matrix elements becomes more and more challenging problem of nuclear physics .",
    "one of the guiding principles for construction of such models consists in testing their predictions for the sm allowed two neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath12-decay ) @xcite which has been directly observed in ten nuclides @xcite , including decays into two excited states ( @xmath6@xcite and @xmath13 @xcite ) .    however , the calculation of the @xmath12-decay matrix elements is a complex task as the nuclei of interest are medium and heavy open shell ones .",
    "an additional complication arises from the fact that this is a second order process in weak interactions and , therefore , the construction of the complete set of states of intermediate nucleus is needed . at present",
    "there are basically two different approaches to the calculation of the @xmath14-decay matrix elements which are the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and the shell model @xcite .",
    "both approaches have their specific advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in particular , the shell model is restricted to configurations with low - lying excitations , but takes into account all the possible correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "the model space of the qrpa includes orbits far away from the fermi surface , what allows one to describe high - lying excited states ( up to 20 or 30 mev ) of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "however , it is questionable whether this approach takes into account the relevant ground state correlations in a proper way .",
    "also , the @xmath12-decay matrix element evaluated within the qrpa exhibits strong sensitivity to the details of nuclear hamiltonian and dependence upon the model assumptions .",
    "the shell model has been found successful in the case of the @xmath12-decay of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , for other nuclear systems the shell model predictions are not convincing enough .",
    "in particular , for heavier nuclei it is not clear whether the considered model space is sufficiently large .",
    "this question becomes irrelevant only in the case when the dominant contribution to the @xmath12-decay matrix element comes from the transitions through the lowest states of intermediate nucleus .",
    "good candidates with this property are especially those nuclear systems for which the ground state of the intermediate nucleus is @xmath16 state , e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "some times ago it was suggested by abad et al .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath12-decays with @xmath16 ground state of the intermediate nucleus are solely determined by the two virtual beta decay transitions : i ) the first one connecting the ground state of the initial nucleus with @xmath18 intermediate state ; ii ) the second one proceeding from the @xmath18 state to the final ground state .",
    "this assumption is known as the single state dominance ( ssd ) hypothesis .",
    "the main advantage of the phenomenological approach based on the ssd hypothesis is that it is model independent since the values of the single @xmath19-decay matrix elements can be deduced from the measured @xmath20 values .",
    "the available experimental data@xcite and the results of theoretical analysis @xcite support the conjecture that the ssd hypothesis is valid for two - neutrino accompanied double beta decay .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the ssd hypothesis can be confirmed or ruled out by the precision measurement of differential rates in the case of @xmath12-decay of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding effects have been studied for the nemo 3 experiment .",
    "previous theoretical studies @xcite of the ssd predictions were based on the approximation , when the sum of two lepton energies in the denominator of the @xmath12-decay matrix element is replaced with their average value . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this treatment can be inadequate for some nuclear systems and demonstrated how to calculate the matrix elements without this approximation .    in this article",
    "we present the results of systematic study of the neutrino emitting modes of double beta decay within the ssd approach without any additional approximation .",
    "the calculated decay rates are given both for transitions to the ground and excited final states .",
    "we also examine the question which of double beta decaying nuclei have the best prospects for experimental verification of the ssd hypothesis via the analysis of the differential rates .    in section [ sec : theory ]",
    "we describe our ssd based approach .",
    "the double beta decay rates are derived in section [ sec : rates ] results and discussions are presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we distinguish four types of neutrino ( antineutrino ) accompanied nuclear double beta decays ( @xmath14-decays ) .",
    "the most attention has been previously paid to the mode with emission of two electrons ( @xmath21-decay ) , @xmath22 where z and a denote atomic and mass numbers of a daughter nucleus , respectively . another possible mode is double beta decay with emission of two positrons ( @xmath23-decay ) , @xmath24 in comparison with the @xmath21-decay this process is disfavored by smaller available kinetic energy and also by the coulomb repulsion on the positron . more favorable for detection than the @xmath23-decay are the capture processes , namely the capture of one bound atomic electron with emission of positron ( @xmath25-decay ) @xmath26 and the double capture of two bound atomic electrons ( @xmath27-decay ) @xmath28 the enhancement of the capture processes in comparison with the @xmath23-decay originates from the larger available energies and from the fact that the suppression due to the coulomb repulsion is partially ( @xmath25-decay ) or fully ( @xmath29-decay ) avoided .",
    "the electron capture from the s - states is a dominant subprocess , because the corresponding electron wavefunction does not vanish at the origin . in practice",
    ", one takes into account the capture both from the @xmath30 and @xmath31 shells .",
    "however , the probability of capture from @xmath31 shell is suppressed by about a factor 10 in comparison with capture from @xmath30 shell .",
    "the inclusion of the electron capture processes into our analysis is , in particular , justified by a reviving interest to the experimental study of these processes @xcite .",
    "the nuclear double beta decay is a second - order process of perturbation theory in weak interaction .",
    "the standard @xmath19-decay hamiltonian has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is fermi constant , @xmath35 is cabbibo angle , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are respectively electron and neutrino field operators , @xmath38 is strangeness - conserving free charged hadron current .",
    "the @xmath14-decay matrix elements involve summation over the discrete states and integration over the continuum states of the intermediate nucleus in the presence of energy denominators corresponding to the second order of perturbation theory in weak interactions .",
    "the neutrino accompanied modes of @xmath14-decay are dominated by the gamow - teller transitions allowed by the angular - momentum , parity and isospin selection rules .",
    "the contribution of double fermi transition to the double beta decay amplitude has been found to be small @xcite .",
    "as is known , in nuclear models , like shell model and qrpa , the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements is restricted to the two subsequent gamow - teller transitions through a certain number of low - lying discrete states of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "the partial @xmath14-decay matrix elements associated with the transition to the ground or excited states of the final nucleus with angular momentum and parity @xmath39 can be written as @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the wave functions of parent , daughter and intermediate nuclei with the corresponding energies @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the terms @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) represent the energy of outgoing electron / positron or ( with the minus sign ) the energy of bound electron and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the energy of emitted neutrino or antineutrino .",
    "both , nuclear and lepton energies are assumed to be in the units of electron mass @xmath55 .    for the sake of simplicity the sum of outgoing lepton energies in the denominators of the @xmath14 matrix elements",
    "is usually replaced with its average value @xmath56 , where @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath27-modes and @xmath59 or @xmath60 for @xmath25-mode ( @xmath61 - @xmath62 , see table [ tab : bbdata ] ) .",
    "this approximation allows one to factorize the lepton and nuclear parts in the calculation of the @xmath14-decay rate .",
    "it works generally quite good for the cases when the dominant contribution to the @xmath14 matrix elements comes from the transitions through the higher lying states of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "the ssd hypothesis drastically simplifies the calculation of the two - neutrino @xmath14 nuclear matrix elements .",
    "it is supposed that nuclear matrix element is governed by the two virtual transitions : the first one going from the initial ground state to the @xmath16 ground state of the intermediate nucleus and second one from this @xmath16 state to the final @xmath63 or @xmath4 state . with this assumption",
    "the relevant nuclear matrix element is as follows : @xmath64 the superscript @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) indicates the neutrino ( antineutrino ) emitting mode of the @xmath14 decay .",
    "the value of this matrix element can be determined in a model independent way from the single @xmath19 decay and electron capture measurements .",
    "> from the experimental values of @xmath67 for electron capture and single @xmath19 decay of the ground state of the intermediate nucleus with @xmath68 we get    [ eq : ssdmel ] @xmath69    where @xmath70 is beta decay constant .",
    "the @xmath14-emitters , which fulfil the ssd hypothesis condition , namely those with @xmath71 ground state of the intermediate nucleus , are listed in tables [ tab : bbdata ] and [ tab : eedata ] .",

    "the effect is significant in the case of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the smallness of the energy difference between the ground states of the intermediate and initial nuclei in comparison with the energy release in the @xmath21-decay process ( see table [ tab : bbdata ] ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath21-decay of @xmath6 is slightly more favored for the experimental verification of the ssd hypothesis than the @xmath21-decay of @xmath7 due about 3 times shorter half - life ( see table [ tab : bbhalf ] ) .     vs. the electron energy @xmath80 for @xmath5-decay to the @xmath3 ground state .",

    "we proposed the study of the differential decay rates as a new perspective possibility for the experimental verification of the ssd hypothesis .",

    "the shape of the single electron / positron distribution and the summed electron spectrum calculated within the ssd are very sensitive to the lepton energies present in the energy denominators . on the other hand , if the main contribution to the double beta decay matrix elements comes , contrary to the ssd hypothesis , from the transition through the higher lying states of intermediate nucleus ( hsd hypothesis ) the dependence on lepton energies in the energy denominators is negligible resulting in the distributions which can be experimentally distinguished from the ssd case . in the present paper",
