    "arguably , newton s problem of the body of minimal resistance is the original variational problem with convexity constraints .",
    "it consists of finding the shape of a solid that encounters the least resistance when moving through a fluid .",
    "this is equivalent to finding a convex function from a convex domain ( originally a disk ) in @xmath0 to @xmath1 that minimizes a certain funtional ( see section [ problem ] ) .",
    "original  solution \" assumed radial symmetry .",
    "this turned out to be false , as shown by brock , ferone and kawohl in @xcite , which sparked new interest to the study of variational problems with convexity constraints .",
    "one can also find these kinds of problems in finance and economics . starting in 1978 with the seminal paper of mussa and rosen @xcite ,",
    "the study of non - linear pricing as a means of market screening under adverse - selection has produced a considerable stream of contributions ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , ... ) . in models where goods are described by a single quality and the set of agents",
    "is differentiated by a single parameter , it is in general possible to find closed form solutions for the pricing schedule .",
    "this is , however , not the case when multidimensional consumption bundles and agent types are considered .",
    "although rochet and chon @xcite provided conditions for the existence of an optimal pricing rule and fully characterized the ways in which markets differentiate in a multidimensional setting , they also pointed out that it is only in very special cases that one can expect to find closed form solutions .",
    "the same holds true for models where the set of goods lies in an infinite - dimensional space , even when agent types are one - dimensional .",
    "this framework was first used , to our knowledge , by carlier , ekeland and touzi @xcite to price financial derivatives traded  over - the - counter \" .",
    "it was then extended by horst and moreno @xcite to model the actions of a monopolist who has an initial risky position that she evaluates via a coherent risk measure , and who intends to transfer part of her risk to a set of heterogenous agents . in both cases",
    "the authors find that only very restrictive examples allow for explicit solutions .    given that a great variety of problems , such as product lines design , optimal taxation , structured derivatives design , etc .",
    "can be studied through the scope of these models , there is a clear need for robust and efficient numerical methods that approximate their optimal pricing schedules .",
    "note that this also provides an approximation of the optimal  products \" .",
    "most of the papers mentioned above eventually face solving a variational problem under convex constraints .",
    "this family of problems have lately been studied under different scopes .",
    "carlier and lachand - robert @xcite have studied the @xmath2 regularity of minimizers when the functional is elliptic and the admissible functions satisfy a dirichlet - type boundary condition . their results can be extended to of our examples .",
    "lachand - robert and pelletier @xcite characterize the extreme points of a functional depending only on @xmath3 over a set of convex functions with uniform convex bounds . in this paper",
    "we provide several variants of an algorithm , based on the idea of approximating a convex function by an affine envelope , to solve these types of problems .",
    "this deviates from previous work by chon and herv @xcite and carlier , lachand - robert and maury @xcite , where the authors use finite element methods . in the former case ,",
    "a conformal ( interior ) method is used and a non - convergence result is given .",
    "as a consequence , the latter uses an exterior approximation method , which is indeed found to be convergent in the classical projection problem in @xmath4 lachand - robert and oudet present in @xcite and algorithm for minimizing functionals within convex bodies that shares some similarities to ours . for a particular problem , they start with an admissible polytope and iteratively modify the normals to the facets in order to find an approximate minimizer .",
    "we estimate the minimizers for several problems with known , closed form solutions as a means of comparing the output of our method to the true solutions .",
    "these are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we provide an example in which we approximate the solution to a risk - minimization problem similar to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "this is still based on the affine - envelope idea , but requires some additional methodology , since it involves solving a non - standard variational problem .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem ]",
    "we state our problem and provide some classical examples . our algorithm and a proof of its convergence",
    "are presented in section [ descriptionconvex ] . in section [ examples ]",
    "we show the solutions obtained via our algorithm to several problems found in the literature .",
    "since these problems share a common microeconomic motivation , we include a brief discussion on the latter .",
    "the examples include the well known ",
    "rochet - chon \" problem , a one dimensional example from carlier , ekeland and touzi and the risk transfer case for a principal who offers call options with type - dependent strikes and evaluates her risk via the  short fall \" of her position .",
