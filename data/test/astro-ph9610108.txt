    "the detailed study of statistically well - defined samples of optically selected qsos is beginning to pin down their ensemble variability properties . an anti - correlation between variability and luminosity has been observed , such that more luminous qsos show a smaller amplitude of the variations ( @xcite , cristiani et al .",
    "it starts also to emerge from the statistical noise a positive correlation between the amplitude of the variability and the redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , cristiani et al .",
    "1996 , @xcite ) .",
    "this latter dependence may be interpreted as an anti - correlation between amplitude of the variability and wavelength in the individual objects ( cristiani et al .",
    "1996 , @xcite , @xcite ) , as suggested by observations of relatively small samples of objects ( @xcite , edelson et al .",
    "@xcite , kinney et al .",
    "@xcite , paltani & courvoisier @xcite ) .",
    "both properties bear important implications for the understanding of the agn energy generation mechanism and distinguishing among the competing variability models based on the black - hole ( @xcite ) , starburst ( @xcite ) and microlensing ( @xcite , @xcite ) scenarios . at the same time",
    "they are central for the quantification of the biases affecting samples selected on the sole basis of variability ( @xcite ) or on the basis of multicolor data , if the photometry was carried out at different epochs in the various wavebands ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    however the variability - redshift correlation could be due to an evolutionary effect , in the sense of a higher activity in the early phases of the agn life .",
    "the only way to remove such an uncertainty is to check directly the variability properties of individual objects , by observing them simultaneously in two or more wavebands . for this reason we have investigated the r - band variability of the sa94 qso sample , the same that in cristiani et al .",
    "1996 ( in the following @xcite ) had been studied in the b band .",
    "we report in section 2 the description of the sa94 qso sample and the photometric material used to investigate its variability ; in section 3 the ensemble structure function is introduced as a statistical measure of the variability properties and the detected trends are further analysed with the aid of other statistical indices ; the results and implications are discussed in section 4 .    throughout the paper we have assumed cosmological constants",

    "the sa94 sample is made up of 149 optically selected quasars mag , applying the k - corrections computed on the basis of the composite spectrum of cristiani and vio ( 1990 ) , and dereddened for galactic extinction according to burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "] listed in table  [ tab : qsos ] , observed in a rectangular area of the sky within the limits @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( epoch 1950.0 ) , covering 17.66 sq .",
    "they have been mainly discovered in the uvx and objective - prism surveys described in @xcite and in the references to table  [ tab : qsos ] .",
    ".list of the qsos in the sa94 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the correlation coefficients indicate a correlation of the variability index with the absolute magnitude and an almost equal anticorrelation with redshift ( correlation coefficients respectively of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , both with a significance greater than 99% ) . due to the strong flux - redshift anticorrelation in the qso sample",
    "it is not possible to disentangle if one of the two correlations is spurious .",
    "however , if , on the basis of the results of the previous subsections and of @xcite , we assume as fundamental the absolute magnitude - variability correlation , it is possible to subtract its influence from the variability - redshift anticorrelation via the method of partial correlation analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "applying this recipe to the results of table  [ tab : cc1 ] , the corrected correlation coefficient between variability index and redshift , turns out to be @xmath8 ( 65% ) , not significant , in agreement with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfz ] .",
    "the decrease of the variability amplitude with increasing wavelength observed in the present qso sample is consistent with the results obtained for individual objects at low redshift by edelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , kinney et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , paltani & courvoisier ( @xcite ) . is this variability - frequency correlation sufficient to account for the positive correlation between redshift and variability found in @xcite ?",
    "let us assume a simple power - law representation of a typical qso spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flux at an observed wavelength @xmath11 , @xmath12 an arbitrary wavelength and @xmath13 the spectral index .",
    "the variability can then be modeled as a change in the spectral index : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function of time . in this way",
    "the flux variations are idealized as changes in the slope of the power - law `` hinged '' on the point of wavelength @xmath16 , that we imagine somewhere redwards of the b and r bands .",
    "converting in magnitudes , @xmath17^{\\alpha+\\epsilon(t ) } + c , \\ ] ] we obtain the following expression for the magnitude variations : @xmath18 \\log\\left [ { { \\lambda_0 ( 1+z ) } \\over \\lambda_{\\rm r } } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      from eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] we would expect a decreasing ratio @xmath20 with increasing redshift . in the present data we observe , if any , a very small decrement of @xmath20 with the redshift ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 for two sub - samples with redshift @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ) .",
    "if we turn back to eq .",
    "[ eq : dm ] , we can see how this lower limit to @xmath16 , together with the typical observed rms for the variability @xmath28 and @xmath29 of 0.35 and 0.28 mag , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig : sfbr ] ) , puts an upper limit to the rms variation of the spectral index @xmath30 .",
    "this value can be compared with the typical dispersion in the spectral indices observed in various qso samples : @xcite have obtained @xmath31 in a control sample of 15 qsos , francis ( 1993 ) observed @xmath32 in a much larger sample , showing also a systematic hardening of the spectrum with increasing redshift . in this way the dispersion in the observed spectral indices of the qso population can be only partially accounted for by variability and significant intrinsic differences between qso and qso have to be invoked ( but see also the dispersion @xmath33 estimated by elvis et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "putting in eq .",
    "[ eq : dm ] our best estimates for @xmath34 and @xmath35  , we obtain for the typical rms variability in the @xmath36 band @xmath37 and @xmath38 mag at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively and @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the @xmath43 band at the same redshifts , consistent with the observations of paper i.    the dependence of the variability time scale on the wavelength is a standard prediction of the accretion disk model .",
    "the temperature of the disk decreases with the radius , and the dynamical , thermal and viscous time scales all increase as @xmath44 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in the standard model , involving instabilities in a thin accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , the intrinsic characteristic time scale should vary as @xmath45 .",
    "more in general , if the source is thermal and if the flux variability is due to temperature changes , the observed wavelength dependence can be naturally produced ( paltani & courvoisier @xcite ) . the only requirement concerns the turnover in the spectral energy distribution that should not be located at such a high frequency that the spectral slope in the observed band becomes independent of the temperature ( e.g. the rayleigh - jeans domain for a black body spectrum ) .",
    "as remarked by di clemente et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , if brighter objects are on average hotter and the variability is due to temperature changes , one would expect a negative correlation between amplitude of the variability and luminosity , as observed .",
    "assuming for example a spectrum of black body or thermal bremsstrahlung , the spectral turnover of brighter objects is progressively shifted at higher frequencies producing progressively smaller flux changes , from @xmath46 for @xmath47 , to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the broad - band variability in the starburst model ( @xcite and references therein ) is defined by the superposition of a variable component , supernova explosions ( sne ) generating rapidly evolving compact supernova remnants ( csnr ) , and a non - variable component , a young stellar cluster and the other stars of the galaxy .",
    "the problem of predicting the wavelength dependence of the variability can be reduced to computing the spectra of the variable and non - variable components , and their relative luminosities . the spectrum of the non - variable component has been predicted to show a @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the variable / non - variable relative luminosities can also be estimated on the basis of stellar evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "much more difficult is to predict the optical / uv spectrum of the variable component .",
    "it is expected to be harder than the non - variable component with a @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can model the total qso flux according to a simple poissonian model ( @xcite ) as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the non - variable fraction of the total flux and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the slopes of the non - variable and variable components . indicating with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the effective wavelengths of the b and r - band and putting for simplicity @xmath59 , we obtain for the ratio between the b - band and r - band variability : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "+ for example , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively ( @xcite ) , the ratio between the b - band and r - band variability is expected to be about 1.4 at @xmath64 , tending to 1 for increasing redshift , independent on the intrinsic luminosity of the qso .",
    "the above reported slight tendency for a decreasing @xmath20 ratio with increasing redshift is compatible with this model .",
    "however , an increase of the @xmath20 with the absolute luminosity is also observed .",
    "we find the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 for two subsamples with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , respectively .",
    "this suggests that more general situations have to be envisaged in which the fraction on the non - variable component and/or the pulse properties ( e.g. the spectral distribution ) depend on the global luminosity of the object .",
    "recently hawkins ( @xcite ) has proposed that the variability of nearly all the qsos ( except the very low redshift ones ) is produced by microlensing .",
    "a non - achromatic behaviour can be accommodated in this kind of model . for a source comparable in size to the einstein ring of the lens , with a quasar disk redder at larger radii",
    ", the bluer compact core would produce a larger amplitude of the variations in the blue passband whereas the larger extent of the red image would cause a small amplitude variation , albeit with a longer duration , in the red .",
    "however it can not be denied that achromatic light variations would have been one of the most significant characteristics of the microlensing model and the present observation of the wavelength dependence make it less appealing / compelling . in particular the superposition of the two competing effects of time",
    "dilation and correlation of the variability with frequency , i.e. redshift , accounts naturally , also in the accretion disk and in the starburst scenarios , for the observed lack of correlation in the observer s rest frame between the variability time scale and the redshift , otherwise claimed as an evidence in favor of the microlensing model .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank i. aretxaga , g. fasano , e. giallongo , m. hawkins , r. terlevich , d. trevese , m. h. ulrich , p. vron and r. vio for enlightening discussions .",
    "this research has been partially supported by the asi contracts 94-rs-107 and by antares , an astrophysics network funded by the hcm programme of the european community ."
