    "our knowledge of the @xmath2-ray  sky has increased dramatically during this last decade , due principally to the @xmath2-ray  instruments on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro)@xcite : egret , a spark chamber plus calorimeter instrument with @xmath2-ray  sensitivity in the energy interval 30 mev to 30 gev ; comptel , a compton telescope in the interval 0.1 to 30 mev ; batse , an omnidirectional x - ray and soft @xmath2-ray  `` burst '' detector consisting of large nai scintillators sensitive to 30 kev to 2 mev photons ( with smaller spectroscopic nai crystals for measurements up to 110 mev ) ; and osse , consisting of nai - csi phoswiches detecting photons of 0.1 to 10 mev .",
    "their observations have revolutionized our understanding of such extragalactic phenomena as blazars and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , as well those within our own galaxy , such as pulsars .",
    "a salient characteristic of these extragalactic sources is their extreme time variability . in the case of blazars , flare states",
    "are observed to occur in which the luminosities vary by over an order of magnitude within time - scales as small as hours .",
    "grbs are singular , extragalactic events due either to the the coalescence of massive compact objects or to the hypernovae of massive early stars , whose luminosities decay over periods of seconds to days depending upon the wavelength observed . for such objects , the importance of correlated , _ multiwavelength _",
    "observations is paramount . by monitoring",
    "the relative time lags of blazar flare peaks at radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath2-ray  wavelengths , for example , the properties of the source regions at the bases of agn ( active galactic nucleus ) jets are constrained .",
    "gamma ray observations of blazars by egret have been particularly crucial , as the luminosity of these objects peaks in the gev - to - tev part of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the transient nature of these sources therefore argues for _ continuous _ coverage of the @xmath2-ray  sky .    until recently , observations with cgro and other space - based and ground - based telescopes",
    "have provided coverage of these and other sources up to the limiting sensitive energy of egret , approximately 30 gev .",
    "from there , a gap in our knowledge of the @xmath2-ray  sky spectrum has existed up to 200 - 300 gev , where ground - based @xmath2-ray  shower detectors presently have their energy thresholds .",
    "it is possible that within this gap there are novel features in the @xmath2-ray  sky , such as a gamma - ray line or continuum emission from postulated neutralino annihilation at the center of the galaxy .",
    "future instruments with sensivity in this unexplored region , such as agile @xcite , recently approved by the italian space agency ( asi ) , or the proposed glast @xcite payload , may uncover exciting new phenomena .    at the present time , however , our view of the @xmath2-ray  sky has diminished . with the effective turnoff of the egret @xmath2-ray  instrument on the cgro due to the nearly complete consumption of its spark chamber gas , there will soon be no operating instrument capable of observing the @xmath2-ray  sky in the energy interval @xmath3 to @xmath4 gev .",
    "ground - based @xmath2-ray  detectors , based on the atmospheric cerenkov technique ( act)@xcite , turn on at current energy thresholds of @xmath5200 - 500 gev . within the next several years energy thresholds for some act observatories",
    "are expected to go to as low as 20 to 50 gev , but lower thresholds than these are unlikely to be achieved due to the sizable effect of earth s magnetic field on the @xmath2-ray - induced air showers , and the lower cerenkov photon yield which must be detected against the night sky background . for @xmath2-ray  energies much lower than @xmath6 gev , then , spaced - based detectors are required .",
    "this observational gap for the energy window @xmath3 to @xmath6 gev will continue to exist for the next several years .",
    "eventually , this gap will be eliminated with the launch of a next - generation @xmath2-ray  satellite , such as glast @xcite , but such a mission is unlikely to occur before the year 2005 .",
    "also the agile satellite @xcite , to be launched in 2002 , will have a limited sensitivity above 50 gev .    in this paper",
    "we describe how the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) can largely fill this gap by acting as a @xmath2-ray  detector with sensitivity in the energy interval of 0.3 to 100 gev during its three - year mission on board the international space station alpha ( issa ) from 2003 to 2006 .",
    "ams , described in detail elsewhere , has as its primary mission the search for cosmic ray antinuclei , which are detected via the negative curvature of their trajectories through a magnetic spectrometer ( see sect . [ ams.sec ] ) .",
    "it is of interest , however , to analyze if a large particle detector like ams , operated on the space station for three years starting in 2003 , could be used to detect high energy @xmath2-rays  .",
    "there are at least two ways this could be done without significantly affecting the experiment sensitivity to antimatter : a ) adding a light ( e.g. @xmath7 ) converter at the entrance of the magnetic spectrometer , either passive ( e.g. , a high - z thin plate ) or active ( e.g. a multilayer tracking detector ) , or b ) implementing an high granularity imaging shower detector at the bottom of the experiment .",
    "option ( a ) consists in a minor modification to the baseline instrument , while option ( b ) , although would give a much higher @xmath2-ray  detection capabilities , requires the addition of a new detector . in this paper",
    "we present a study which has been perfomed on option ( a ) .",
    "we will show that in this option , ams can also detect @xmath2-rays  with performance characteristics similar to egret in the energy region of 0.3 to 20 gev , and with significantly enhanced capabilities between 20 and @xmath5 100 gev , a region which is not well unexplored .",
    "we refer to this modified instrument as `` ams/@xmath2 '' .",
    "we show that ams/@xmath2  can continue the valuable work of egret by providing continued monitoring of extragalactic and galactic @xmath2-ray  sources and by participating in multiwavelength observational campaigns .",
    "in addition , ams/@xmath2  will have unprecedented sensitivity to the @xmath2-ray  sky between the energies of 20 to @xmath8 gev ( albeit at a level somewhat lower than required for detection of known sources with power law spectra ) , so that ams/@xmath2  might provide us with unexpected discoveries in this region .",
    "the next section gives a brief description of the baseline ams instrument , and the modifications required for adding @xmath2-ray  detection capability in option ( a ) .",
    "section 3 describes the performance characteristics of ams/@xmath2  determined from monte carlo analyses , and section 4 uses these results to address the question of what @xmath2-ray  astrophysics can be done with ams . the results obtained analyzing option ( a ) give a hint of the physics potential which could be reached implementing option ( b ) for the flight of ams on the space station ; option ( b ) would gain a factor of about @xmath9 in @xmath2-raysstatistics over option ( a ) .",
    "detailed analysis of option ( b ) , however , wil be the subject of future work .",
    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer has been built by a large international collaboration of high energy physics institutions from the u.s . ,",
    "italy , china , finland , france , germany , taiwan , russia , and switzerland .",
    "it recently had a successful test flight on the space shuttle mission sts-91 in june , 1998 @xcite , where it was carried in the cargo bay and observed for several days in both the zenith and nadir directions , the latter for measurement of albedo cosmic ray backgrounds .",
    "it is scheduled to be secured to an external payload attachment point on the international space station alpha in 2003 , where it will remain as a zenith - pointing instrument for a minimum of 3 years .",
    "the basic design of ams is shown in figure [ ams-nim.fig ] .",
    "the magnet spectrometer consists of a permanent ring dipole magnet made of very high grade nd - b - fe rare earth material whose magnetic energy product and residual induction are respectively @xmath10 g - oe and 14,500 g , yielding an analyzing power of @xmath11 t - m@xmath1 with less than 2 tonnes of magnet mass .",
    "four silicon strip detector tracking planes are located within the magnetic volume , with a fifth and sixth plane located just above and below the magnet .",
    "these are based on technology developed for the aleph and l3 vertex detectors at lep @xcite , and consist of @xmath12 m thick , double - sided , high purity silicon wafers .",
    "the total area of this tracker is about an order of magnitude larger than the size of previous microstrip silicon detectors .",
    "the momentum resolution of the silicon spectrometer is given in figure [ y94725.fig ] at low rigidities ( below 8 gv ) the resolution is dominated by multiple scattering ( @xmath13 ) , while the maximum detectable rigidity ( @xmath14 ) is about @xmath15 gv .",
    "the parameters of the silicon spectrometer are given in table 1 .",
    "in addition to measuring particle rigidity , the silicon planes will provide six independent measurements of @xmath16 for charge determination .",
    ".ams silicon tracker parameters ( in parenthesis the values used on the precursor flight ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in models 2d and 4d , the density profile is fixed to follow the `` universal '' profile found by nfw , for which @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the last halo profile is an approximation to the true isothermal profile ( see binney & tremaine , 1987 ) : @xmath19 figure [ jpsi-nim.fig ] shows the resulting @xmath20 curves for the various halo profiles .",
    "the remaining two parameters that determine the @xmath2-ray  flux are , from eq .",
    "[ dfdo2.eq ] , the neutralino mass @xmath21 and the annihilation cross sections @xmath22 that result in @xmath2-ray  production .",
    "monochromatic photons from @xmath23 and @xmath24 are necessarily produced via box diagrams @xcite , and so have a smaller branching ratio that tree - level annihilation into @xmath25 and @xmath26 pairs .",
    "secondary @xmath2-rays  from the decay of tree - level @xmath25 s and @xmath26 s give a much larger continuum flux , which , depending on the susy parameters , may be well above the extragalactic @xmath2-ray  background flux ( section [ egrb.sec ] ) near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "monochromatic @xmath2-ray  detection is limited both by detector energy resolution ( fig .",
    "[ energyres.fig ] ) and aperture .",
    "should the expected event rate be significantly greater than unity , the line width must be small enough so that the signal is not lost in the galactic and extragalactic @xmath2-ray  backgrounds .",
    "the rapid deterioration of energy resolution above 100 gev limits ams detection of _ monochromatic _",
    "@xmath2-rays  to neutralino masses @xmath27 gev .",
    "( this limit does not apply to detection of continuum photons from @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays ; see section [ continuum.sec ] . )",
    "however , recent analysis by the dama / nai collaboration has confirmed the presence of an annual modulation in their detector s event rate ( at 98.5% c.l . ) , suggesting the existence of a local wimp density with a @xmath28 mass range @xmath29 gev , and wimp - nucleon scalar elastic cross section @xmath30 nb , where @xmath31 is the fraction of the local dark matter density that is due to wimp neutralinos @xcite . within this mass range",
    "our rms energy resolution is flat at 24% .",
    "these mass and cross section ranges have also been shown to be fully compatible with a mssm neutralino being the major component of dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "figure [ mono-nim.fig ] illustrates the sensitivity of ams to detection of line photons from the annihilation channel @xmath32 as a function of halo model . plotted are integrated @xmath2-ray  counts @xmath33 as a function of angle @xmath34 from the galactic center for the four halo profile models , accumulated over a two - year period by ams , assuming @xmath35 gev and a velocity - cross section product @xmath36 @xmath37/s . with an energy acceptance width of 20 gev ,",
    "approximately 80% of the line photons are captured .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the galactic and extragalactic background count for this energy window ; the parameterization of bergstrm , ullio , and buckley @xcite was used for the galactic background contribution . the dashed and dotted lines correspond respectively to the `` berezinsky - like '' halo ( model 2f of dehnen and binney @xcite ) and the quasi - isothermal halo , while the upper and lower solid lines correspond to models 4d and 2d of dehnen and binney , which are the nfw - like models .",
    "bergstrm and ullio @xcite have recently performed a full one - loop calculation of the @xmath23 annihilation reaction , assuming the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "they performed extensive scans in susy parameter space to map out the range of values of the annihilation cross section versus neutralino mass .",
    "we have reproduced their figure 3a in figure [ twogamma-nim.fig ] , along with the ams sensitivity for the two most optimistic halo profiles , models 2f and 4d , expressed as a lower limit on @xmath38 versus @xmath21 for detection of neutralino annihilation .",
    "the detection criteria were arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total number of annihilation @xmath2-rays  detected over a 2-year operating period within the central few degrees of the galactic center , and @xmath42 is the total number of background photons from diffuse galactic emission detected within the energy window and the same solid angle about the galactic center .",
    "ullio and bergstrm @xcite also performed a mssm full one - loop calculation of neutralino annihilation via @xmath43 , assuming a pure higgsino state for the neutralino .",
    "for this channel the @xmath2-ray  has an energy @xmath44 . in figure [ onegamma-nim.fig ]",
    "we have reproduced figure 6 of ullio and bergstrm , which shows their @xmath45 versus higgsino mass ( solid line ) , along with the unitary lower bound on this cross section ( dashed line ) . superimposed on this plot",
    "is a line segment which shows the minimum @xmath45 required for detectability by ams over a 2-year period , assuming the `` berezinsky - like '' halo model 2f of dehnen and binney @xcite .",
    "none of the other halo models intersect the ullio and bergstrm curves .",
    "thus for this pure higgsino annihilation channel only the most singular halo profile can yield a detectable signal .    in general , then , only the more singular of the halo profile models , in which the dark matter density continues to increase as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , can give hope for line photon detection by ams , and then only in a restricted region of mssm parameter space .",
    "it should be kept in mind that a fraction of this restricted region may already have been eliminated by the absence of a detection by egret , but such an analysis has yet to be completed @xcite .",
    "continuum photons from the decay of @xmath25s and @xmath48s produced by tree - level annihilations @xmath49 are far more abundant than the line @xmath2-rays  considered above , and so possibly provide the greatest chance for detection , assuming the neutralino mass is above that of the @xmath25 and @xmath48 .",
    "berstrm , ullio , and buckley @xcite have used the pythia monte carlo code @xcite to determine the the continuum photon energy distribution from @xmath50 annihilation into @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 pairs .",
    "they find that the hardest distributions come from @xmath51 and @xmath52 pairs , and that the annihilation rate is dominated by @xmath51 and @xmath52 production at higher ( higgsino - like ) neutralino masses . from a scan of mssm parameter space , they find that the models with the highest rate of @xmath51 and @xmath52 production yield an observed differential photon flux of @xmath54 where @xmath55 for @xmath56 gev .",
    "the @xmath20 factor is given by eq .",
    "[ jpsi.eq ] .    using the @xmath20 functions of the four halo models described above ( fig .",
    "[ jpsi-nim.fig ] ) , the differential flux coming from a solid angle @xmath57 about the galactic center can be obtained and compared to the flux from the galactic and extragalactic backgrounds . using the collection area*time product @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ areatime.fig ] ) for ams , the differential event count is obtained .",
    "figures [ cont.300.1-nim.fig ] to [ cont.300.32-nim.fig ] show these event counts after integration over @xmath34 out to three different solid angles about the galactic center , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and 1.0 steradians .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the diffuse galactic and extragalactic background photon count ; the upper and lower solid lines correspond to halos for models 4d and 2d , respectively ; the dashed line corresponds to the `` berezinsky - like '' halo model 2f ; and the dotted line comes from the quasi - isothermal halo model .",
    "the faux - data points shown in the figures take into account the effect of detector energy resolution ; these are the counts obtained in each energy bin after convolution with the monte carlo energy resolution functions ( fig .",
    "[ energy.fig ] ) .",
    "there are a number of salient features , the primary one being the strength of the signal compared to the diffuse background for essentially all of the halo models considered . for this particular ( optimized ) mssm model",
    "it is likely that egret would have already provided a detection given any of the halo models considered here .",
    "although there is a large variation in signal between the various halo models , it appears nevertheless that for _ any _ of these halo models a substantial region of mssm parameter space can be constrained by the absence of a continuum @xmath2-ray  signal .",
    "these figures also show that the differing angular dependences of the background and signal result in there being an optimal solid angle @xmath57 that maximizes signal to noise , with more singular profiles having a stronger signal to noise at smaller solid angles .",
    "these differing angular dependences can also be used to discriminate the signal from the diffuse backgrounds .",
    "finally , we point out that continuum photons result from @xmath61 as well as from @xmath51 and @xmath52 pair production , producing scaled spectra similar to those from @xmath25 and @xmath48 decays .",
    "this implies that ams/@xmath2  sensitivity to continuum @xmath2-rays   may extend down to the current lep limits on the neutralino mass @xcite .",
    "we have shown that with minor modifications the alpha magnetic spectrometer can become a powerful @xmath2-ray  detector as well , with overall performance characteristics being comparable , if not superior , to those of egret . with @xmath2-ray  energy resolution extending past 100 gev , and with an aperture that is nearly flat above @xmath62 gev , ams/@xmath2  can address a number of outstanding issues in @xmath2-ray  astrophysics that relate to the relatively unexplored region of @xmath63 gev .",
    "for one , ams/@xmath2  will likely confirm or refute the hypothesis that unresolved blazars are responsible for the bulk of the extragalactic @xmath2-ray  background ; ams/@xmath2  will also extend the spectrum of the diffuse galactic background to above 100 gev , helping to resolve current difficulties in interpreting the egret diffuse galactic background measurement @xcite .",
    "ams/@xmath2  should roughly double the total number of blazars detected in @xmath2-rays , and will be enable multiwavelength observational campaigns to include the gev region of blazar spectra during the flight years of 2003 - 2006 .",
    "there is an additional possibility that an indirect detection of the cosmic uv and optical photon background can be made through the detection of extinctions in high - redshift blazars above @xmath64 gev .",
    "ams/@xmath2  will also likely observe gev @xmath2-ray  emission from one or more gamma ray bursts during its operational lifetime .",
    "ams/@xmath2  will also search for both line and continuum emission of @xmath2-rays  from the region of the galactic center created by the annihilation of dark matter neutralinos .",
    "although the sensitivity to line emission appears marginal , there is nevertheless a finite , though small , region of halo / mssm phase space which allows a detection by ams .",
    "however , a much larger region of dark - matter halo / mssm parameter space can be constrained in a search for continuum @xmath2-rays  by ams/@xmath2 .",
    "we thank b. dingus , s. hunter , and p. ullio for helpful conversations , and p. sreekumar for the same and for supplying us with additional , unpublished information on the egret measurement of the extragalactic @xmath2-ray  background .",
