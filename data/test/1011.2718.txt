    "the study of ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos provides an opportunity for study particle physics beyond the reach of the lhc @xcite . in particular , the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) is sensitive to neutrinos of energy @xmath3 gev @xcite . a crucial ingredient in the calculation of attenuation of neutrinos traversing the earth and the event rate in high energy neutrino telescopes is the high energy neutrino - nucleon cross section , which provides a probe of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the kinematic region of very small values of bjorken-@xmath4 .",
    "the typical @xmath4 value probed is @xmath5 , which implies that for @xmath6 gev one have @xmath7 at @xmath8 gev@xmath9 .",

    "the description of qcd dynamics in the high energy limit still is a subject of intense debate ( for a recent review see e.g. ref .",
    "theoretically , at high energies ( small bjorken-@xmath4 ) one expects the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics , where only the parton emissions are considered , to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a non - linear evolution equation .",
    "this regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath10 @xcite . moreover",
    ", the growth of the parton distribution is expected to saturate , forming a color glass condensate ( cgc ) , whose evolution with energy is described by an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for the correlators of wilson lines @xcite . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the first equation of this hierarchy decouples and boils down to a single non - linear integro - differential equation : the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "experimentally , possible signals of parton saturation have already been observed both in @xmath11 deep inelastic scattering at hera and in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "existing estimates of the neutrino nucleon cross sections with structure functions constrained by hera data are based on linear dynamics ( dglap or an unified dglap / bfkl evolution ) or phenomenological models that mimics the expected behaviour predicted by the non - linear qcd dynamics . in particular , the neutrino - nucleon cross section was originally calculated at leading order in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the resulting parametrization being a benchmark for the evaluation of sensitivies of uhe cosmic neutrinos . in refs .",

    "these non - linear approaches were improved recently with the solution of the bk equation including running coupling corrections and the successful description of the hera data .",
    "this fact motivates a revision of previous estimates .",
    "in particular , we present for the first time the predictions for the neutrino - nucleon cross section obtained using as input the numerical solution of the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite including running coupling corrections @xcite .",
    "moreover , we present the predictions of some recent phenomenological parametrizations based on saturation physics , which provide an economical description of a wide range of data with a few parameters . our main motivation is to provide an update on the neutrino - nucleon cross section in the literature and estimate the theoretical uncertainty in its behaviour at ultra high energies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section ( section [ cross ] ) we present a brief review of the neutrino - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross section , introducing the main formulae . in section [ dinamica ]",

    "deep inelastic neutrino scattering is described in terms of charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions , which proceed through @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchanges , respectively .",

    "the calculation of @xmath0 involves integrations over @xmath4 and @xmath21 . on the one hand ,",
    "as the parton distributions behaves as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) at low @xmath4 , the @xmath4 integral becomes dominated by the interaction with partons of lower @xmath4 . on the other hand , the @xmath21 integral",
    "remains dominated by @xmath21 values to the order of the electroweak boson mass squared . for @xmath21 above @xmath28",
    "the integrand behaves as @xmath29 and quickly becomes irrelevant .",
    "as the neutral current ( nc ) interactions are subdominant , we will consider in what follows , for simplicity , only charged current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "in the qcd improved parton model the structure functions @xmath30 are expressed in terms of the parton distributions on the nucleon , which satisfy the dglap @xcite and/or bfkl @xcite linear dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "an efficient way of introducing non - linear effects is the description of the structure functions considering the color dipole approach in which the dis to low @xmath4 can be viewed as a result of the interaction of a color @xmath31 dipole which the gauge boson fluctuates @xcite . in this approach the @xmath32 structure function is expressed in terms of the transverse and longitudinal structure functions , @xmath33 which are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the transverse size of the dipole , @xmath36 is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a quark and @xmath37 are proportional to the wave functions of the virtual charged of neutral gauge bosons corresponding to their transverse or longitudinal polarizations .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath37 are given , e.g. , in ref .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 describes the interaction of the color dipole with the target . in next section",
    "we will discuss some models for @xmath38 , based on the non - linear qcd dynamics , which describe the current hera data .",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the hera measurements of the structure function at low - @xmath4 ( @xmath39 ) are for very low values of @xmath21 ( @xmath40 gev@xmath9 ) , which implies that small @xmath4 extrapolations of the parton distributions are necessary to estimate @xmath0 above @xmath41 gev .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail in the next sections , these extrapolations contain significant uncertainties .",
    "high energy neutrino - nucleon cross section accesses very large values of @xmath21 and very small values of bjorken @xmath4 . in the last years , it has been calculated considering different theoretical approaches with structure functions constrained by hera data .",
    "it was originally calculated using the lo dglap equation in ref .",
    "@xcite ( gqrs model ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( c - ss model ) a next - to - leading order analysis was performed considering a global fit of the zeus data and the uncertainties on high energy @xmath0 which are compatible with the conventional dglap formalism was estimated .",
    "another approach based on dglap dynamics was proposed in @xcite ( fjkppp model ) , where @xmath0 was estimated using an analytic result for the dglap evolution of the structure functions , valid at twist-2 in the region of small-@xmath4 and for a soft non - perturbative input .",
    "as the dglap equation can break down at low @xmath4 because of the @xmath42 terms which appear in the perturbative series , an alternative approach which incorporates both the @xmath42 resummation and the complete lo dglap evolution was proposed in @xcite , which we denote unified dglap - bfkl model hereafter ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these predictions are based on the linear dglap and/or bfkl equations which implies a power increase with the energy of the neutrino - nucleon cross section that eventually violate the froissart bound . in ref .",
    "@xcite the uhe @xmath0 was estimated using a phenomenological approach ( bbmt model ) which considers the imposition of the froissart unitarity and analyticity constraints on inclusive deep - inelastic cross sections .",
    "it implies that @xmath43 at very small @xmath4 . in @xcite very good fits to data were obtained for @xmath44 and a wide range of @xmath21 .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , this model was updated considering the most recent analysis of the complete zeus and h1 datasets from hera . in what follows",
    "we denote by bhm the corresponding predictions .    another alternative to estimate",
    "the ultrahigh energy behavior of the neutrino - nucleon cross section is to express the structure functions in the dipole approach [ eq .",
    "( [ funcs ] ) ] and to consider the state - of - art of the non - linear qcd dynamics : the color glass condensate formalism . in this formalism , the dipole - target cross section @xmath38 can be computed in the eikonal approximation , resulting @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dipole - target forward scattering amplitude for a given impact parameter @xmath47 which encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",

    "the first equation of this hierarchy decouples and boils down to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .    in the last years the next - to - leading order corrections to the bk equation",
    "were calculated @xcite through the ressumation of @xmath53 contributions to all orders , where @xmath54 is the number of flavors .",
    "such calculation allows one to estimate the soft gluon emission and running coupling corrections to the evolution kernel .",
    "the authors have verified that the dominant contributions come from the running coupling corrections , which allow us to determine the scale of the running coupling in the kernel .",
    "the solution of the improved bk equation was studied in detail in refs .",
    "basically , one has that the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental data , with the geometric scaling regime being reached only at ultra - high energies . in @xcite a global analysis of the small @xmath4 data for the proton structure function using the improved bk equation was performed ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast to the bk equation at leading logarithmic @xmath55 approximation , which fails to describe the hera data , the inclusion of running coupling effects in the evolution renders the bk equation compatible with them ( see also @xcite ) .    .",

    "the dipole - target cross section can also be calculated considering phenomenological parametrizations for @xmath56 based on saturation physics , which provide an economical description of a wide range of data with a few parameters .",
    "several models for the forward dipole cross section have been used in the literature in order to fit the hera and rhic data @xcite . in general , the dipole scattering amplitude is modelled in the coordinate space in terms of a simple glauber - like formula as follows @xmath57 \\,\\ , , \\label{ngeral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the anomalous dimension of the target gluon distribution .",
    "the main difference among the distinct phenomenological models comes from the predicted behaviour for the anomalous dimension , which determines the transition from the non - linear to the extended geometric scaling regimes , as well as from the extended geometric scaling to the dglap regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the current models in the literature consider the general form @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the anomalous dimension at the saturation scale and @xmath61 mimics the onset of the geometric scaling region and dglap regime .",
    "one of the basic differences between these models is associated to the behaviour predicted for @xmath61 . while the models proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite assume that @xmath61 depends on terms which violate the geometric scaling , i.e. depends separately on @xmath35 and rapidity @xmath62 , the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( buw model ) consider that it is a function of @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , these authors demonstrated that the rhic data for hadron production in @xmath64 collisions for all rapidities are compatible with geometric scaling and that geometric scaling violations are not observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the iim analysis @xcite implies that a substantial amount of geometric scaling violations is needed in order to accurately describe the @xmath11 hera experimental data . in our analysis",
    "we will estimate @xmath0 considering the rcbk solution and the iim and buw models .",
    "moreover , we will consider the improved version of the iim model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted hereafter iim - s model ) , which includes the heavy quark effects on the saturation in the fit of the hera data .",
    "the main differences of the iim - s model in comparison to the iim one are the larger value of the anomalous dimension and the smaller value of the exponent which determines the energy growth of the saturation scale .",
