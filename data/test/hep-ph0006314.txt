    "the success of the perturbative aspect of the standard model is truly impressive , the theory being now tested at higher than one - loop accuracy .",
    "it is natural that over the past years various methods have been proposed to calculate higher loop graphs . beyond one loop ,",
    "there are situations in which one can neglect internal masses , or exploit the kinematics to evaluate amplitudes analytically at some special point where the feynman diagrams become simpler . these special situations , while ingenious , cover only certain classes of physical processes",
    ".    there have been attempts to formulate solutions for two - loop feynman diagrams , which ideally should be as general as the one - loop solutions are . for the massless case",
    "a lot of progress has been reached recently @xcite . on the other hand , for the general massive case",
    ", it has become clear that some numerical treatment appears unavoidable because of the complexity of the scalar integrals involved .    in refs .",
    "@xcite a reduction scheme was found for treating massive self - energy diagrams at two - loop , with the resulting master scalar integrals being evaluated numerically .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we investigated the problem of a general massive two - loop algorithm , which would deal with multi - leg diagrams as well .",
    "once we subscribe to a semi - numerical approach , some demands must be made , which are based on the generality , the universality , the effectiveness and the accuracy that a particular formalism engenders .",
    "we have shown that for any external kinematics and internal masses , we can reduce every two - loop amplitude for a process due to any renormalizable interactions into a set of ten scalar integrals and their derivatives .",
    "it is not hard to see how a result like this is obtained if we consider first a scalar theory with trivial interactions @xcite .",
    "then , there would be two internal momenta , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and by the use of feynman parameters to combine sets of denominators in which either @xmath4 or @xmath5 or @xmath6 runs through , and to make shifts in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we have an integrand proportional to    @xmath7^{\\alpha_1}(q^2+m_2 ^ 2)^{\\alpha_2 } [ ( p+q)^2+m_3 ^ 2]^{\\alpha_3}\\ ] ]    in which a four - vector @xmath8 is left over , which is a linear function of the external momenta and feynman parameters .",
    "the `` masses '' @xmath9 are functions of external momenta , internal masses and feynman parameters .",
    "these are to be integrated over @xmath4 , @xmath5 and a set of feynman parameters . by partial",
    "differentiating with respect to @xmath9 , there is in principle only one basic function arising from @xmath10 we need to know , although for convenience one may add @xmath11 it is clear that different interactions and different graphs will give different polynomials of feynman parameters to the numerators , and also different @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "an extension of this construction to tensor integrals will give us the main result mentioned earlier .",
    "in the following section , we discuss the steps and arguments needed to perform a tensorial decomposition .",
    "we show that there is a small set of basic functions which are needed , which have simple , one - dimensional integral representations .",
    "their analytic structure is easy to see , and therefore the integration contour can be extended into the complex plane and optimized for rapid numerical convergence . in section 3",
    ", we shall give a detailed exposition of the numerical techniques involved .",
    "given that two - point functions are usually simpler to calculate , many calculations existing in the literature used unitarity cuts of self - energies to calculate lower loop - order inclusive decay rates .",
    "we would like to stress that , given a process , our formalism allows us to calculate the amplitudes individually , as opposed to using unitarity cuts . as an immediate consequence , it becomes possible to obtain rates for exclusive processes , without the need to integrate over the whole final - state phase space .    in section 4 , for illustration",
    ", we discuss in detail the application of our method to the important physical process @xmath12 .",
    "the starting point of calculating a massive two - loop diagram is to express it in terms of integrals of a standard type .",
    "topologically , any generic two - loop diagram can be represented in the form shown in figure 1 . by introducing a set of feynman parameters",
    "@xmath13 to combine all propagators which have the same loop integration momentum @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath14 , the graph can always be represented as an integral over a sunset - type two - loop integral .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : intosunset ] .",
    "all dependence on the external momenta @xmath15 and internal masses @xmath16 is now contained in the variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath8 , which also depend on the set of feynman parameters @xmath13 .",
    "= 12 cm    the original feynman diagram is written at this point as an integral over tensor functions of the following type ( all momenta are rotated into euclidean ) :    @xmath20^{\\alpha_{1 } } \\ ,               ( q^{2}+m_{2}^{2})^{\\alpha_{2 } } \\ ,               ( r^{2}+m_{3}^{2})^{\\alpha_{3 } }          }      ~~ . \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    by casting the graph in this form , our strategy is to develop a uniform treatment of all possible sunset - type functions which can be generated from generic two - loop feynman graphs . the further tensor reduction and decomposition into standard scalar functions",
    "is done by using standard formulae common for all diagrams .",
    "therefore it can be automatized in the form of an algebraic manipulation program .    at the end ,",

    "this two - loop integral is a tensor constructed from the external momentum @xmath21 and the metric tensor @xmath22 .",
    "given that , one way of obtaining the tensor decomposition would be to write down all tensor structures allowed by the symmetry of the integral , use appropriate projectors , and solve the resulting equations .    another way to do",
    "this is by decomposing the loop momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 into components parallel and orthogonal to the external momentum @xmath21 :    @xmath23    after this decomposition , the tensor decomposition is obtained by noticing that the functions with an odd number of transverse loop momenta @xmath24 and @xmath25 vanish , while the even functions are transverse to @xmath21 @xcite . in ref .",
