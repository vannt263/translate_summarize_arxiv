    "recent simulations of active region formation have started from a coherent semi - torus of magnetic field placed in the surface layers of a model solar convection zone @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that such a coherent structure is not necessary for the formation of an active region . the action of magneto - convection itself produces rising flux tubes , which when they reach the surface can produce an active region .",
    "we use the stagger code @xcite to simulate magneto - convection in a domain 48 mm wide by 20 mm deep .",
    "this depth is 10% of the geometric depth of the solar convection zone , but contains two thirds of its pressure scale heights .",
    "horizontal directions are periodic and the vertical boundaries are open with plasma and magnetic field moving through them . because of the large domain dimensions the coriolis force from the solar rotation begins to have some effect ,",
    "so we include f - plane rotation at a lattitude 30 deg north .",
    "the initial state was a snapshot of hydrodyanamic convection which had been relaxed for several turnover times ( about 2 days at 20 mm depth ) .",
    "we then started advecting minimally structured , uniform , untwisted , horizontal magnetic field into the domain by inflows at the bottom .",
    "the initial field strength was 200 g ( weak enough to have little dynamic effect ) , which was slowly increased with a 5 hour e - folding time until it reached 1 kg strength and thereafter held constant .",
    "the incoming field is at 30 deg to the east - west axis .",
    "the active region is not affected by the horizontal boundaries : first , because its size is 25 mm inside a 48 mm wide box , second , because it is spreading very slowly with time and , third , because the top boundary is close by ( at the temperature minimum ) so the magnetic field does not have room to spread out much in the atmosphere and interact with the mirror active regions produced by the horizontal periodicity .",

    "the area of major flux emergence is confined by the convective up- and down - flows and does not fill the entire domain .",
