    "recent photometric surveys such as the acs survey of galactic globular clusters @xcite have substantially increased the quality and volume of data available for the galactic globular cluster system . despite the fact that this survey focused on metal poor stellar populations it was found that there was a need for stellar evolution models with @xmath0 } } > $ ] 0 @xcite .",
    "many other photometric surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and extensions such as segue underscore the need for stellar evolution libraries that span a wide range of compositions and photometric systems .",
    "@xcite introduced a set of stellar evolution tracks , isochrones , and computer programs to accompany the acs survey of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the set includes tracks with masses between 0.1 and 1.8 @xmath2 , isochrones with ages ranging from 2 to 15 gyr , [ fe / h ] from 2.5 to 0 with a variety of options in @xmath1}}$ ] and initial he content ( y@xmath5 ) . in this paper , that set of models is expanded to include : ( i ) tracks and isochrones with [ fe / h]= + 0.15 , + 0.3 , and + 0.5 ; ( ii ) higher mass tracks and isochrones with ages as low as 250 myr for all compositions ; ( iii ) a wider selection of photometric systems ; and ( iv ) a web interface to three of the computer programs so that visitors can easily generate specific models without downloading the entire database and running the programs locally .",

    "the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( dsep ) has been described previously by @xcite and @xcite . the following is a brief description of the physics employed by dsep .",
    "partially inhibited atomic diffusion and gravitational settling of both he ( y ) and metals ( z ) are included as described by @xcite .",
    "diffusion is calculated based on the formalism of @xcite but inhibited in the outer 0.01 @xmath2 where the diffusion coefficients are set to zero in the outermost 0.005 @xmath2 and ramped from zero to full diffusion in the inner 0.05 @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite present spectroscopically selected cluster members for stars in a sample of galactic globular and open clusters for purposes of validating the segue stellar parameter pipeline .",
    "the selected stars from m  13 and ngc  2420 are used here because they represent the cleanest available data sets of clusters on the sdss ugriz system .",
    "though these sequences are quite narrow and well  defined , they are not as deep as allowed by sdss , but are suitable for the purpose of demonstrating the performance of the isochrones .",
    "figure [ sdss ] shows the g vs. ( g  i)@xmath38 cmds of m  13 ( left ) and ngc  2420 ( right ) along with appropriate isochrones .",
    "the photometry has been de - reddened by @xcite using the @xcite dust maps .",

    "the isochrones follow the locus of stars on the ms and rgb well .",
    "the only real discrepancy is the slope of the sgb but this is a common problem with synthetic color isochrones compared to metal poor systems .",
    "plotted on top of the ngc  2420 data in figure [ sdss ] is the same isochrone as in @xmath65.2.3 but now transformed to g vs. g  i plane .",
    "the agreement between the data and the isochrone is excellent on the ms but the observational constraints of the sample do not permit comparison with stars in the convective hook or past the msto .",
    "bluer synthetic colors , as represented by b ",
    "v in this section , continue to require adjustments in order to match observed cmds as figures [ m37 ] through [ n6791 ] indicate .",
    "the semi - empirical color transformation of vc03 are an improvement over the synthetic b ",

    "i when used in conjuction with the dsep isochrones . while the synthetic colors and magnitudes are suitable analysis of observational data in bandpasses with central wavelengths longer than @xmath30  , empirically adjusted colors ought to be used at shorter wavelengths . in these redder bands ,",
    "the synthetic colors perform well throughout the cmd , including on the lower main sequence where they perform better than the empirical colors .    the optical to near - infrared comparisons in v ",
    "j ( m  37 only ) and v  k of the open clusters are favorable for entire extent of the ms and the rgb in the older clusters but larger reddening than suggested by the adopted reddening curve is needed in some cases .",
    "the location of he burning stars in the open clusters is matched by the models in the older clusters ( m  67 and ngc  6791 ) but for the younger clusters the models predict the red clump to be fainter ( ngc  2420 ) and/or redder ( m  37 and the hyades ) than the data suggest .",
    "the general lack of evolved stars in the cmds of both m  37 and the hyades makes it difficult to speculate as to whether the models are intrinsically too cool or whether the colors are too red for a given @xmath7 .",
    "the dartmouth stellar evolution program has been used to compute a large grid of stellar evolution tracks .",
    "a subset of these tracks and isochrones were presented by @xcite and are extended in this paper to include younger ages , higher metallicities , and transformations to multiple photometric systems .",
    "these models take advantage of the latest advances in radiative opacities , nuclear reactions rate , and the equation of state .",
    "the dartmouth stellar evolution database comprises a set of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones transformed to several photometric systems along with a set of computer programs that allow for interpolation and construction of luminosity functions and synthetic horizontal branch models .",
    "the database spans a wide range of compositions from @xmath0}}$]=2.5 to + 0.5 , @xmath1}}$]=0.2 to + 0.8 ( at @xmath0}}\\leq$]0 ) or + 0.2 ( at @xmath0}}>$]0 ) , and additional models with enhanced he for @xmath0}}$]=2.5 to 0 .",
    "the models were transformed to the observational plane using a synthetic color transformation based on ` phoenix ` model atmospheres for @xmath2810,000 k and @xcite for hotter temperatures .",
    "the synthetic color transformations are compared to the vc03 semi - empirical transformations in b  v and v  i .",
    "the synthetic colors perform well in v ",
    "i but are consistently too red in b  v . as a general rule , the synthetic colors should only be trusted in bandpasses equivalent to v or redder , i.e. those with central wavelengths longer than @xmath30  . in these bands ,",
    "the synthetic colors were found to perform well  and better than the empirical colors on the lower main sequence .",
    "synthetic photometry in the bluer bandpasses ( those with central wavelengths shorter than @xmath30  ) does not compare favorably with observations .",
    "empirically adjusted magnitudes and colors should be favored for the bluer bandpasses whenever possible .",
    "the isochrones were compared to isochrones from other groups at @xmath0}}$]=0 and + 0.15 as well as photometry from open clusters and one globular cluster .",
    "the isochrones extend to lower mass ( 0.1 @xmath2 ) than those of other major isochrone libraries and provide reasonable fits to the ms of the clusters shown in @xmath65 .",
    "the dartmouth stellar evolution database should prove useful in studies of resolved stellar populations in the local universe and is suitable for application to population synthesis and integrated light models .",
