    "the idea that the images of distant objects might be distorted and even multiply imaged by the gravitational potentials of intervening objects is one of the earliest predictions of general relativity .",
    "gravitational lenses , perhaps better described as gravitational mirages , are now proving powerful tools in cosmological studies .",
    "the equations of general relativity can be cast in a form where the gravitational potential acts like an index of refraction . as in the case of terrestrial mirages , variations in this index of refraction cause distortions of bundles of light rays , and occasionally permit viewers to see several such bundles which were emitted in different directions .",
    "the result is a multiply imaged ( or strongly lensed ) gravitational lens system .",
    "perhaps 50 distant active and normal galaxies are known , at present , to be strongly lensed by mass concentrations lying roughly along what would otherwise be the shortest path between the galaxy and the earth .",
    "the most spectacular case , shown in figure 1 , is that of the cluster of galaxies cl0024 + 1654 which produces five readily recognized images of a more distant ring galaxy . in this image",
    "the background lensed object is identified by its blue colour , while the cluster member galaxies appear reddish yellow .",
    "the cluster distorts each of the five images somewhat differently , but these distortions are easily understood as the effect of the cluster s gravitational potential .    one important use of such systems is to map the gravitating mass in the lensing object .",
    "another use is to magnify features in distant objects which would otherwise be too small to be resolved .",
    "several star forming galaxies at very high redshift have been studied in unprecedented detail thanks to the resolution of these megaparsec - scale natural telescopes .",
    "in addition to studying individual objects , be they sources or lenses , multiply imaged systems can be used to derive global cosmological parameters : the matter density of the universe , @xmath1 ; the cosmological constant , or the vacuum contribution to the energy content of the universe , @xmath2 ; and the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath0 .",
    "the first two of these dictate the overall geometry of the universe , i.e. how distances to objects relate to their measured redshifts .",
    "because lenses and sources populate a wide range of redshifts , statistical properties of large samples of lensed objects , such as the distribution of their source and lens redshifts and angular separation of images , depend on the geometry of the universe .",
    "for example , a non - zero cosmological constant increases the volume of space at high redshifts , hence the abundance of distant lensed systems can be used to estimate @xmath2 .    while statistics of complete samples of lensed objects are needed to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a single lensed system , such as a multiply - split high redshift qso ( quasi - stellar object , or quasar ) can in principle yield the value of @xmath0 .",
    "in such a situation the light travel times for the bundles of light from multiple images are different , permitting the observer to see the emitting source at two different moments in time .",
    "the resultant time difference , or time delay , depends upon the differences in the path lengths among the multiple light paths . because all of the angles are known in many lensed systems , a difference in path lengths is sufficient to determine all distances , and thereby fix the linear scale of the universe .",
    "this `` time delay '' phenomenon and its utility for the determination of @xmath0 was the subject of a recent workshop at the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories , jodrell bank , part of the university of manchester s department of physics and astronomy .",
    "virtually everything one might want to calculate for a gravitational lens can be computed from the expression for the light travel time for a photon traveling from a source to an observer ( narayan and bartelmann 1996 , blandford and kundi 1996 ) . as can be seen from the equation in figure 2 ,",
    "there are two contributions to the light travel time : a geometric contribution , proportional to the square of the difference in angular position between where the source would have appeared and where the image does appear , and a gravitational contribution , which results from the gravitational potential altering the effective index of refraction . for a `` thin '' lens",
    ", the gravitational effects can be lumped together as a 2d projected potential by integrating the 3d potential along the line of sight .",
    "a 2d plot of this light travel time is called the arrival time surface ; the example in figure 3 shows isochrones .",
    "fermat s principle tells us that images of the source will appear wherever the light travel time is a minimum , a maximum or a saddle point . to find these stationary points",
    "one takes the gradient of the light travel time with respect to position on the sky and sets it equal to zero .",
    "this gives a vector equation , often called `` the lens equation '' , for the positions of the images on the plane of the sky .",
    "there may be one , three , five or more solutions to this equation , giving an odd number of images . applying the lens equation to the arrival time surface of figure 3",
    "one can readily identify the positions of five images , marked as dots .",
    "the cross is the position of the source in the absence of the lens .",
    "the time delay between the images is just the difference in `` height '' of the arrival time surface at the image positions .    taking the gradient of each cartesian component of the lens equation",
    "separately , one finds expressions for the partial derivatives of the source position with respect to the image position .",
    "assembling these terms ( which include second derivatives of the projected potential ) as a matrix gives the `` back projection matrix '' , telling what size source corresponds to what size image .",
    "more useful is its inverse , `` magnification matrix '' , which tells us how a source is distorted .",
    "an important point here is that for a potential which is sharply peaked at its centre , the back projection factor is large ( because of the large second derivatives of the potential ) , and the magnification small . while in principle",
    "one should see odd numbers of images , in practice the images which ought to appear near the centres of the lensing galaxies ( maxima in the light travel time ) are so strongly demagnified that they are rarely detected .",
    "hence virtually all the lenses one sees are classified as doublets or quadruplets , in seeming contradiction of the requirement that there be an odd number of images .",
    "figure 3 shows the shapes and sizes of the five images produced by our lens from a small circular source . because lensing conserves surface brightness of the source ( a consequence of liouville s theorem ) , the apparent sizes of the images are directly proportional to their magnifications .",
    "note that  as for actually observed galaxy lenses  our lens demagnifies the central image so that it is barely detected .",
    "the light travel times are proportional to the distance from the observer to the lens and the distance from the observer to the source and are inversely proportional to the distance from the lens to the source",
    ". the relative sizes of these quantities can be determined from the redshifts of the lens and the source , but the overall scaling factor depends upon the hubble constant , the value for which continues to be a matter of some debate .",
    "if the difference in light travel times can be measured , and if the gravitational potential can be modelled , one can solve for the hubble constant .",
    "some 18 years have passed since the discovery of the first gravitationally lensed quasar by walsh and collaborators ( walsh _ et al . _",
    "1979 ; walsh , 1989 ) .",
    "if measuring distances to such systems were really so straightforward , one might reasonably wonder why questions regarding the cosmological distance scale havent long since been resolved .",
    "as one might have guessed from the name of the workshop , not all lenses are equally useful  hence the quest for the `` golden lens '' .",
    "perhaps the most frustrating fact is that , despite their reputation , most quasars are surprisingly non - variable ; there are beautifully multiply - imaged quasars which fail to show appreciable flux variations over the timescale expected for a time delay .",
    "other strongly lensed systems are so symmetrical that the time delays are both very short and very sensitive to small errors in the measurement of the relevant positions . still other systems are quite promising except for the fact that either the lensing galaxy or the lensed quasar is too faint for a redshift measurement",
    ".    there have been sociological hurdles as well .",
    "the scheduling of 50 or 100 appropriately spaced observations for a time - delay monitoring program is not always easy , especially with changes in instrument configurations and the traditional scheduling scheme at optical observatories whereby a single program is given a contiguous block of several nights .",
    "even if the foregoing problems are overcome and a near - perfect lens system is found with its properties carefully measured , there still remains a challenge of constructing a model for the gravitational potential of the system .",
    "the task is not trivial because the observables provide a rather limited set of constraints for the model , leaving us to rely on various assumptions about what a galaxy should look like in general .",
    "in addition , it often happens that the main lensing galaxy is embedded in a group or cluster of galaxies , like in the case of q0957 + 561 .",
    "such additional mass concentrations around the lens make model building even more difficult , and the resultant @xmath0 even more uncertain .    because both observational and theoretical aspects of the problem are challenging and time - consuming there has been something of a chicken - and - egg problem , with observers reluctant to embark upon a monitoring campaign without first having a good model , and model builders reluctant to make detailed models before time delays have been measured .",
    "one has to start somewhere , and the recent class survey goes a long way towards addressing the observational challenges .",
    "the past couple of decades have produced a number of large comprehensive surveys in astronomy .",
    "all the `` early '' lenses were serendipitously discovered during some of these surveys ; for example the original double quasar q0957 + 561 a , b was discovered during the optical spectroscopic follow - up of jodrell bank 966 mhz sources .",
    "the quadruple system q2237 + 0305 , another famous member of the lensing family , was discovered in the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) galaxy redshift survey .",
    "only a handful of surveys have been specifically designed to uncover new lenses , or have finding new lenses as one of their main goals .",
    "the mit - green bank 5 ghz , parkes - mit - nrao 5 ghz , and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) snapshot surveys are among these .    by",
    "far the largest of such surveys is the ongoing class , an acronym which stands for the cosmic lens all sky survey ( myers _ et al .",
    "this effort is the follow - on to the jodrell bank vla astrometric survey ( jvas , patnaik 1993 ) .",
    "the class collaborators , including astronomers from jodrell bank , the netherlands and the us , have obtained radio images of some 10 000 flat spectrum radio sources using the very large array in socorro , new mexico . only by heavily automating their data reduction",
    "were the investigators able to sift through the enormous volume of data gathered to identify the most likely candidates .",
    "a dozen or so of these have proven probable lenses .",
    "the class candidates have been followed up at higher angular resolution using the merlin interferometric array , and at optical and ir wavelengths using the william herschel telescope on la palma and the keck telescope on mauna kea .",
    "optical images of many of these newly discovered lenses have been taken with the hst , most of them clearly showing the galaxy responsible for the lensing .",
    "new lenses from the class and jvas surveys have brought new surprises .",
    "contrary to the theoretical wisdom of the past decade , most of the galaxy lenses in this sample are classified as spirals or s0s and not ellipticals .",
    "the two best examples of spiral galaxy lensing are the objects b0218 + 357 and b1600 + 434 .",
    "the disk in the latter case appears to be almost exactly edge - on .",
    "spurred by these observations , theorists have now turned to the problem of modelling spirals . unlike elliptical galaxy models whose potential is well represented by some variation on the basic isothermal sphere , the spiral galaxies also have a flattened disk which has to be taken into account because the lensing cross section increases dramatically when disk is turned edge - on .",
    "it appears that q0957 + 561 , the first lens to be discovered , was not unique in being a member of a group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "several other lenses have companions in close projection to the main galaxy lens , some with confirmed matching redshifts . in hindsight",
    "this is not surprising  galaxies are known to cluster , and the larger optical depth presented by close collections of galaxies increases magnification , thereby enhancing the chance that the background object is included in flux limited surveys .",
    "the class has also uncovered a few unusual and puzzling lenses .",
    "perhaps the most spectacular of these is the new lens b1933 + 504 , which shows a total of 10 radio images .",
    "observationally the images can be grouped into those of similar radio spectra and compactness . with the help of analytical models ,",
    "one concludes that one is seeing three components of an active radio galaxy ; the compact flat spectrum central core and one of the steep spectrum lobes are both quadruply imaged , while the second radio lobe is doubly imaged .",
    "the abundance of multiple images makes this system ideal for modellers ; it fails to qualify as a `` golden lens '' because the lack of an optical counterpart , even with the hst , means that the redshift of the source is unknown .",
    "the jvas lens b0218 + 357 is an excellent system for time delay measurements .",
    "it consists of two components which have been observed to vary in radio flux ( vla 15 ghz ) , the degree of polarization , and the polarization position angle .",
    "as the variations can be tracked by all three methods , and are relatively large , 10% , it should be possible to measure the time delay to high fractional accuracy .",
    "the current estimate , @xmath3 days , is likely to improve rapidly .",
    "the modelling of this system should be helped by the existence of a radio ring , and the fact that the lensing galaxy , a face - on spiral , is clearly visible .",
    "the galaxy contains neutral and molecular gas , seen in absorption against the background radio images .",
    "however , before b0218 + 357 is modelled in detail two aspects of the systems must be understood : the separation of the two radio images and two optical components are different by 10% ( significant given the size of the error - bars ) , while the flux ratio of the images differs by a factor of nearly 40 between the optical and the radio .",
    "dust , known to exist in spiral galaxies , may be in part responsible for these observations .",
    "jvas lens b1422 + 231 , a quadruple system with three very bright images and a fourth faint one , presents a serious problem for modellers .",
    "the image positions can be easily fitted by a range of models , but when radio flux ratios are taken into account there is no acceptable analytical fit for the galaxy .",
    "it is generally thought that radio flux ratios should provide useful additional constraints for the overall potential of the galaxy .",
    "this is because the radio - emitting region of the source quasar is substantially larger than the lensing cross - sections of individual stars in the lensing galaxy , so that microlensing by stars should not introduce flux variations in the images above and beyond those attributed to the smooth potential of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "moreover , radio flux is not obscured by dust .",
    "thus it appears either the models tried so far are inadequate for b1422 + 231 , or that its substructure significantly affects image magnifications .",
    "class b1608 + 656 , shown in figure 4 , is another potential `` golden lens '' .",
    "the source is unusual because it is not a quasar but a post - starburst radio galaxy .",
    "the extended nature of the galaxy gives rise to a broken ring observed in the lensed image .",
    "the system is being monitored with the vla , and the time delays are reported to be of the order of a few weeks .",
    "a potential problem is that the lensing galaxy does not seem simple : it is either an interacting system , or its image is split by an obscuring dust lane .",
    "the present sample of class lenses , though exciting and fascinating , is not yet a complete sample in a statistical sense .",
    "this is because the quadruplets and higher multiplicity systems are much easier to confirm as lenses using geometry , without the help of optical counterparts and redshifts .",
    "double systems , as well as larger separation lenses with several arcseconds between images , and lenses without obvious galaxies are more difficult to confirm as lenses .",
    "as @xmath0 can be determined from an individual lens system , ( or a collection of lenses to take into account modelling and observational errors ) the current class results can already be used for that purpose , while some other cosmological applications ( those that require statistically homogeneous samples ) must wait until the class survey is complete .",
    "the progress reported at the jodrell bank meeting was along three principal fronts .",
    "the first of these was the discovery of a large number of new lenses , the most interesting of which are described above .",
    "the second area in which considerable strides have been made has been in the measurement of time delays .",
    "the relatively small amplitude of flux variations demands scrupulous attention to calibration in carrying out observations . by the end of the meeting",
    "the number of secure measurements of time delays had doubled from two to four .",
    "the best determined time delay is that for the oldest known system , q0957 + 561 . using two year s worth of data obtained in 1995 - 1996 at the apache point observatory in new mexico and a range of different methods to analyze the light curves",
    "( see figure 5 ) , kundi , wambsganss and collaborators ( kundi _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) found the time delay between a and b to be @xmath4 days , confirming the earlier , less robust result of schild and cholfin ( 1986 ) .",
    "the time delays in a quadruple pg1115 + 080 , the second gravitational lens to be discovered , are currently determined to @xmath5 accuracy .",
    "this is likely to improve with the addition of more data .",
    "the lenses b0218 + 357 and b1608 + 656 now have measured time delays , from radio observations , for which the fractional uncertainty is also likely to improve rapidly .    a third front on which progress was reported was in modelling the gravitational potentials , which make a substantial contribution to the total time delay .",
    "the potentials are constrained by the observed pattern of multiple images .",
    "but there are few images , so the potentials are poorly constrained .",
    "the lens equation shows that the image positions depend upon derivatives of potential rather than on the potential itself .",
    "but it is the potential that determines time delays ; reconstructing it from a small number of derivatives is an ill - posed problem .    in a few cases",
    "some extra constraints to aid reconstruction are provided by the additional images observed in the system .",
    "for example , vlbi images of q0957 + 561 show a core and a radio jet with five blobs , each of which is also doubly imaged .",
    "these extra constraints are much needed in this system where the lens consists of a galaxy plus a parent cluster and hence requires more parameters for even minimal modelling .",
    "there is an intrinsic degeneracy in the modelling because from the image data alone we do not know how the total mass causing the image separation is split up between the galaxy and the more smoothly distributed cluster mass .",
    "this `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' which translates into an uncertainty in @xmath0 , can be broken in a number of ways .",
    "one is by observing additional images , such as jet components in q0957 + 561 .",
    "another , is by studying the lens itself : a measured velocity dispersion within the main galaxy can be , albeit with caveats , converted into its mass .",
    "alternatively , a weak shear map of the background galaxies , or the velocity dispersion of galaxies within the cluster , can be used to estimate cluster mass .",
    "it is encouraging that different ways of breaking the degeneracy in q0957 + 561 lens lead to nearly the same estimates of @xmath0 .    a further strategy to surmount",
    "the problem of limited constraints is through the modelling of the lensing mass .",
    "some groups have adopted `` reasonably '' parameterized galaxy models , while others constructed non - parametric models imposing additional constraints requiring smoothness and a degree of central concentration .",
    "the ultimate test is whether modellers using different techniques agree on the predicted time delays .",
    "agreement appears to be best in the case of q0957 + 561 , which is also the lens with the best measured time delay .",
    "the current status of lens time - delay measurements is given in table 1 , where we have listed separately the fractional uncertainties associated with the time - delay measurements and with the models for each of the four lenses with secure time delays .",
    "in the last column we show the derived value of the hubble constant for three of the four systems .",
    "agreement is quite good , but with the simplifying assumptions made in modelling , a mere three systems seems hardly adequate .",
    "the onus for improving this state of affairs falls equally on those measuring delays and on those making models .",
    "gravitational lens time delays are hardly the only means of measuring extragalactic distances and there has been considerable talk recently ( kennicutt 1996 ) about the convergence of the many different methods .",
    "the crucial rung on what is known as the `` cosmological distance ladder '' is the period - luminosity relation of cepheid variable stars ( jacoby _ et al .",
    "their use as distance indicators dates back to the historic curtis - shapley debate of 1920 ( trimble 1995 ) where cepheids were used , though somewhat erroneously , to argue _ against _ the extragalactic nature of `` spiral nebulae '' . the modern distance ladder ( really a coupled set of ladders ) relies ultimately on parallax measurements , but includes as a key link the calibration of the period - luminosity relation for cepheids .",
    "there is considerable debate at present about the extent to which this relation depends upon the abundances of elements heavier than helium , since these abundances can be quite different in other galaxies from the values measured locally in the milky way .",
    "moreover the distances to milky way cepheids have become more uncertain rather than less uncertain with the first published results from the hipparcos astrometric satellite .    unlike the distance ladder , the gravitational lensing method measures distances on truly cosmological scales , and does so directly , bypassing all the rungs of the ladder together with their associated errors .",
    "one other method can claim that : the sunyaev - zel@xmath6dovich technique basically compares the line of sight extent of the cluster , estimated from the properties of its hot x - ray emitting gas , to the cluster s @xmath0-dependent projected size .",
    "systematic uncertainties associated with projection effects and gas clumpiness tend to underestimate @xmath0 .    while at present the gravitational lenses give distances which are no more accurate than the other distance indicators , they are at least subject to a completely different set of systematic errors . the major recognized source of these is lens modelling , including the mass - sheet degeneracy .",
    "these systematic uncertainties have not yet been explored mostly because lens models used until recently were all rather similar .",
    "the new and better data from the class survey and other campaigns have prompted a more comprehensive look at modelling , a trend which will soon allow us to assess critically the associated errors .",
    "the mass - sheet degeneracy can in principle be mostly resolved with independent measurements of the smooth cluster mass around the images .    given that all methods are subject their own systematic uncertainties , it is essential to pursue all the available methods in order to reach a convergence .",
    "several requirements need to be met in order to measure @xmath0 from gravitational lensing .",
    "first , a multiply imaged lens system has to be found that possesses a number of desirable characteristics , like well resolved images , measurable source variability , easily visible lensing galaxy and optical image counterparts .",
    "once a system is found , it must be extensively observed to get well sampled image light curves and accurate astrometric information .",
    "several of the new class lenses and several previously known satisfy these requirements to various degrees ; a few appear to be potential `` golden lenses '' .",
    "next , a good analytical model for the gravitational potential of the lensing galaxy/ galaxies is needed . because the observed parameters of the lens are not nearly enough to constrain the model properly , many different approaches must be explored , so as to quantify carefully the uncertainties arising from modelling . since several parametric and non - parametric modelling techniques",
    "have been published recently a comparison of these will soon be possible .    finally , after random and systematic errors have been assessed , the comparison of model predicted and observed time - delays between images will yield the value of the hubble constant . taking stock of the recent observational and theoretical developments , the prognosis for the gravitational lens method is excellent .                                  .observed and predicted uncertainties in the time delays between images in four gravitationally lensed systems with most secure measured time delays .",
    "the best estimate for the @xmath0 is quoted in the first three cases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]"
