    "@xmath65 then it is said that a bifurcation occurs at @xmath65 .",
    "for example at an equilibrium @xmath64 ( where of course @xmath67 ) , a bifurcation occurs iff the linearisation @xmath68 admits eigenvalues with vanishing real part . in this case a non - trivial centre manifold exists .",
    "the aim of bifurcation theory is to obtain insights into the qualitative changes in the flow in this kind of situation .",
    "this can often provide valuable information on the dynamics of the system for parameter values close to @xmath65 , for instance the number and stability of stationary solutions .",
    "this information is obtained when certain criteria are satisfied .",
    "typical examples of relevant conditions are whether certain combinations of derivatives of @xmath69 at @xmath70 are zero or non - zero or the signs of such combinations . when studying a bifurcation at a stationary point @xmath64 it is often possible to reduce the dimension of the space of unknowns @xmath62 using centre manifold theory .",
    "a detailed discussion of this can be found in chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "the essential qualitative features occur on the centre manifold whose dimension is equal to the dimension of the space of generalized eigenvectors of the linearization @xmath71 corresponding to purely imaginary eigenvalues .    to make this more concrete we consider the example of greatest importance in what follows , the cusp bifurcation .",
    "suppose that the dynamical system is one - dimensional , remembering that this may have resulted from a system of higher dimension by centre manifold reduction .",
    "suppose that @xmath63 has two components @xmath72 and @xmath73 . by choosing coordinates",
    "appropriately it can be assumed that the bifurcation occurs at the point @xmath74 .",
    "the system is said to exhibit a generic cusp bifurcation if @xmath75 where the subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to the corresponding variables .",
    "if only the first three of these conditions are satisfied it might be said loosely that there is a cusp bifurcation but this does not exclude the possibility that extra degeneracies might occur .",
    "these can be ruled out by imposing the last two conditions and this is what is meant by the term generic here .",
    "when the one - dimensional system arises from a system of higher dimension by centre manifold reduction the diagnostic conditions for a cusp bifurcation can be reexpressed in terms of algebraic conditions on derivatives of the original system , as explained in chapter 8 of @xcite .",
    "this will be seen in more detail in the example of the dual futile cycle in sect .",
    "[ bistabmm ] .",
    "the significance of the cusp for the results of this paper is that when a bifurcation of this type with @xmath76 occurs at some point there are nearby parameter values for which there exist two stable stationary solutions , and one which is unstable .",
    "the case @xmath77 gives one stable and two unstable stationary solutions and is not relevant for what follows .",
    "the name cusp bifurcation comes from the following .",
    "figure [ cuspfig ] shows @xmath78 , where the horizontal plane is the plane of parameters @xmath79 , and the vertical direction the one dimensional variable @xmath62 .",

    "near a cusp bifurcation , this surface shows a fold .",
    "the line delimiting the folding region projected into the horizontal parameter plane forms a cusp , although the surface in @xmath78 is smooth . for a given parameter in the cusp region , there are two stable equilibria and one unstable one .",
    "furthermore there are heteroclinic orbits connecting the unstable equilibrium to the two stable ones .",
    "next some remarks will be made on geometric singular perturbation theory ( gspt ) .",
    "this theory was developed by fenichel @xcite and section 3 of that paper provides an introduction to some of the main ideas involved .",
    "the standard situation in which this theory is applied is for a system of ode of the form @xmath80 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to a time coordinate @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath81 are smooth functions and @xmath36 is a parameter .",
    "the aim is to understand the qualitative behaviour of solutions of this system in the limit @xmath82 where the system ( [ gspt ] ) reads @xmath83 the system ( [ gspt0 ] ) is called the reduced system .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced system may provide useful information about the qualitative behaviour of solutions of the system ( [ gspt ] ) with @xmath36 small and non - zero .",
    "the system ( [ gspt ] ) is singular at @xmath37 since the time derivative of @xmath84 is multiplied by a factor which vanishes there .",
    "this means that regular perturbation theory can not be applied .",
    "note that the system ( [ rescaled1])-([rescaled7 ] ) is of this general form .",

    "coordinate @xmath33 and adding the equation @xmath87 gives the following system of @xmath88 equations @xmath89 call system ( [ extsys ] ) the extended system .",
    "this extends smoothly to @xmath37 to @xmath90 assume that the set defined by the equation @xmath91 is equivalent to @xmath92 for a smooth function @xmath93 .",

    "call these eigenvalues corresponding to eigenvectors transverse to @xmath94 the transverse eigenvalues .",
    "they correspond to the eigenvalues of the linearization of the system @xmath95 with @xmath62 held fixed .",
    "this leads to the following    [ transeigen ] for a point @xmath96 , we define the transverse eigenvalues at @xmath62 as the eigenvalues of the linearisation @xmath97 , under the assumption that none of them is purely imaginary .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that there exists a manifold @xmath98 which is a centre manifold for all points of @xmath94 close to a given point .",
    "the manifold @xmath98 is sometimes called a slow manifold .",
    "the restriction of the extended system ( [ extsys ] ) to the slow manifold @xmath98 can be interpreted as a system of @xmath99 equations depending on the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "remarkably , rewriting this system in terms of the time coordinate @xmath34 gives a system which depends on @xmath36 in a regular fashion , even at @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath37 it coincides with the reduced system ( [ gspt0 ] ) . for @xmath31 call",
    "this the perturbed reduced system .",
    "the reduction theorem of shoshitaishvili ( see @xcite , theorem 5.4 ) shows that the qualitative behaviour of solutions of the extended system ( [ extsys ] ) near a point of @xmath94 is determined in a simple way by the dynamics on @xmath98 .",
    "in fact it is topologically equivalent to the product of the dynamics on @xmath98 with a standard saddle .",
    "what this means in practise is that dynamical features of the reduced system ( [ gspt0 ] ) are inherited by the full system ( [ gspt ] ) for @xmath36 small . in the case of the central example of this paper",
    "the real parts of the transverse eigenvalues of the linearization at points of @xmath94 defined in [ transeigen ] are all negative .",
    "thus the standard saddle mentioned above is a hyperbolic sink in this case .",
    "this implies that bistability of the mm system ( which is the reduced system in this case ) is inherited by the perturbed reduced system .",
    "it then follows from the theorem of shoshitaishvili that bistability is inherited by the mm - ma system . in other situations , as will be explained further in sect .",
    "[ further ] , the existence of periodic solutions of the reduced system is inherited by the full system .",

    "the reduction theorem makes transparent what is happening on an abstract level . on the other hand the concrete calculations which are needed to verify the presence of a non - degenerate cusp bifurcation by obtaining a suitable approximation to the centre manifold and analysing the dynamics on that manifold are hard to keep track of .",
    "here we follow an approach to organizing these calculations explained in section 8.7 of @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to calculate certain combinations of derivatives of the right hand side of the mm system at the point @xmath101 with respect to the unknowns and the parameters . for the cusp bifurcation",
    "it is necessary to vary two parameters .",

    "in addition , and this is the difference to what was done in @xcite , two of the reaction constants are rescaled , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",

    "@xmath7 must be used .",
    "this system may be compared with one extracted from the system of @xcite in a way similar to that done for the dual futile cycle above .",
    "this time we take the equations for the substances in the first two layers and remove the explicit feedback .",
    "this is done by setting the concentrations @xmath253 $ ] , @xmath254 $ ] and @xmath255 $ ] to zero .",
    "then the equations for those quantities are satisfied identically and the dependence of the first reaction rate @xmath227 in @xcite on @xmath255 $ ] disappears . in the resulting system",

    "the interaction not captured in the phenomenological description is what is called sequestration . in certain circumstances",
    "a lot of the substance @xmath230 is bound to its substrates @xmath7 and @xmath8 and so is not available to take part in the reaction converting it back to @xmath217 in the first layer .",
    "the equations ( [ mapkmm1])-([mapkmm3 ] ) are a reduced system for the truncated huang - ferrell model in the sense of gspt .",
    "the transverse eigenvalues ( as defined in [ transeigen ] ) have negative real parts .",
    "in contrast to the system arising for the dual futile cycle the right hand side of the equations entering the computation of the transverse eigenvalues is no longer affine .",
    "however the only nonlinear terms are in the equation for @xmath260 and the derivatives of these terms do not influence the eigenvalues .",
    "all the other terms are either diagonal or belong to @xmath192 blocks which are similar to those already treated in the case of the dual futile cycle .",
    "hence if it were possible to show that ( [ mapkmm1])-([mapkmm3 ] ) has a hyperbolic stable periodic solution then it would follow immediately that for @xmath36 sufficiently small the full system also has a periodic solution .",
    "this is because hyperbolic stable periodic solutions persist under regular perturbations of a dynamical system .",
    "thus the task of proving the existence of the periodic solutions of the truncated huang - ferrell model found numerically in @xcite reduces to proving an analogous statement for the reduced system .",
    "since the former has dimension nine , even after exploiting all conservation laws , and the latter has dimension three , this could be a significant advantage .",
    "the question of existence of periodic solutions of the reduced system will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "another interesting question concerns the dependence of the results of theorems [ bistabmm ] and [ bistabmm - ma ] on the modelling by mass - action kinetics . a crucial argument in the present paper",
    "consists in verifying the conditions for a cusp bifurcation to take place .",
    "it is already technical for the mass - action kinetics where equilibria and derivatives can be computed explicitly . on the one hand ,",
    "such computations seem difficult with a more general model for the kinetics of the chemical reactions .",
    "but on the other hand , the fact that the evolution equations have a polynomial reaction rates is not essential .",
    "models with more general right hand side could lead to similar results .",
