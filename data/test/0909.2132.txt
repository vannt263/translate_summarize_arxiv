    "friction forces have been long studied since the formulation of coulomb - amonton s laws . the laws of friction have been widely studied from the macroscopic scale to the nano scale  @xcite .",
    "the establishment of frictional contact between two solids by a normal force and its disruption by a tangential force are important processes in friction , and the frictional contact has been directly observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently , mser and coworkers and daly et al . have proposed another mechanism of friction , that is , the origin of coulomb - amonton s laws is the presence of intervening dirt molecules or atoms between two solid surfaces  @xcite . in a model of kinetic friction",
    "@xcite , mser assumed a potential between the intervening particle and the top ( or bottom ) surface such as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the periods of the top and bottom wall , respectively .",
    "a certain viscous force acting on the lubricant atom is further assumed for energy dissipation .",
    "a smooth motion is observed for the intervening particle and no kinetic friction appears , if the interaction force between the particle and the surface is a simple sinusoidal one , i.e. , @xmath8 for @xmath9 ; however , kinetic friction appears as a result of a stick - slip motion , if the interaction forces include a certain higher - harmonic component , e.g. , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 for @xmath11 .",
    "recently , the friction and rheological properties of granular materials have been intensively studied .",
    "granular materials exhibit various states such as a gaslike state , a liquidlike state and a solidlike state .",

    "one of the interesting phenomena is the clustering in the gas phase owing to inelastic collisions  @xcite .",
    "stick - slip motions caused by the frictional vibration have been studied numerically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "they are related to the transition between the liquidlike state and the solidlike state  @xcite .",
    "the transition from the liquidlike state to the solidlike state when the density is increased is called jamming transition  @xcite .",
    "several scaling relations were found for the static properties such as the pressure and the average coordination number near the jamming transition  @xcite . scaling laws for rheological properties of sheared granular materials",

    "thus , we conclude again in our numerical simulation that no kinetic friction appears in a single - particle system .",
    "we have studied frictional forces using a few inelastic particles intervening between two rough surfaces .",
    "the simplest model is a single - particle system without the rotational degree of freedom . even in this simplest system ,",

    "we have found a kind of jamming transition by changing the interval @xmath51 between the two walls . below the critical interval ,",
    "the intervening particle is trapped in the lower ( or upper ) wall .",
    "time - averaged resistance force @xmath39 is roughly proportional to the constant velocity @xmath2 of the upper wall .",
    "no kinetic friction appears in a single - particle system , because @xmath39 approaches zero in the limit @xmath4 . at @xmath187 ,",
    "a chaotic time evolution is found , and the average resistance force is approximated as @xmath77 .",
    "we have confirmed that the maximum static friction is equal to the maximum value of the time - periodic resistance force @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum static friction corresponds to the yield stress for the granular solidlike state .",
    "we have also confirmed the appearance of a stick - slip motion even in this single - particle system , when the upper wall is forced via a spring .",
    "kinetic friction has appeared in a two - particle system .",
    "the mutual collisions between the intervening particles seem to play an important role in the appearance of kinetic friction and the nontrivial average velocity @xmath136 . at the moment of mutual collisions ,",
    "impulsive forces are exerted on the lower and upper walls .",
    "the amplitude of the impulsive forces does not decrease even for a sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "the resistance force @xmath0 behaves as @xmath144 for a sufficiently small @xmath2 ; therefore , the time average of @xmath0 takes a nonzero constant value even for a sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "we have further observed the propagation of mutual collisions in a ten - particle system .",
    "the mutual collisions between the intervening particles occur even for a sufficiently small pulling velocity .",
    "the mutual collisions between intervening particles induce the dissipation of kinetic energy in the @xmath35 direction , which might lead to kinetic friction ; however , the detailed mechanism of this phenomenon is not yet completely understood theoretically .",
    "our model is similar to mser s model in that the intervening particles play an important role .",
    "however , no kinetic friction appears if there is only one intervening particle , but kinetic friction appears as a result of the mutual inelastic collisions between the intervening particles .",
    "we consider that the origin of kinetic friction in our model is different from that in mser s model .",
    "finally , we have incorporated tangential viscous and elastic forces in the model equations .",
    "if the tangential viscous forces are included , the intervening particle exhibits a unidirectional motion with @xmath140 , when the tangential viscosity is larger than its critical value .",
    "however , the appearance or nonappearance of kinetic friction do not depend on the tangential viscous force .",
    "if both the tangential viscous force and tangential elastic force are included and the rotational degree of freedom is not taken into consideration , the nonzero resistance force @xmath5 appears .",
    "however , if the rotational degree of freedom is taken into consideration , @xmath39 becomes zero for a sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "our model system is simple , but its dynamical behavior is rather complex .",
    "it is left for future study to analyze the system from the viewpoint of the theory of dynamical system , as well as to associate the present results for a small number of particles with the dynamical behavior of many - particle systems .",
