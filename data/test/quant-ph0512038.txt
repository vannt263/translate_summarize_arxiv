    "we have in mind the limit of quasi - free atoms and therefore consider the case of shallow traps @xmath47 in which the oscillation period of an atom is much larger than the time @xmath48 it takes to scatter a photon .",

    "following englert s fashionable choice @xcite , we call this binary degree of freedom a qubit .",

    "an external cooling laser field serves as a thermal bath for the trapped atoms .",
    "the detector is thus in a thermal state @xmath55 at inverse temperature @xmath56 with partition function @xmath57 .",
    "the total final state is then obtained by applying the transition operators associated with way @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath58 in general , @xmath59 is not a unitary operator since it describes only the scattering amplitude around the backscattering direction .",
    "the factor @xmath60 guarantees , however , that @xmath61 is properly normalized .",
    "adapting englert s general definitions @xcite , we can express the _ visibility _ @xmath62 and the _ distinguishability _ @xmath63 obeying the fundamental _ duality relation _ @xmath64 as follows : @xmath65 the visibility is the ratio of interference contribution and background intensity @xmath66 and therefore equal to the cbs contrast .",

    "another interesting quantity is the _ predictability _ @xmath69 the predictability measures the amount of which - way information available _ a priori _ , as for instance in unbalanced interferometers like young s double slits with different widths . for balanced interferometers @xmath70 ,",
    "the predictability vanishes , @xmath71 .    with the help of these quantities",
    ", we can quantify the breakdown of coherent photon backscattering by mobile atoms , both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "the distinguishability @xmath72 is difficult to evaluate in our case because it is defined via the trace - class norm of operators on the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of harmonic oscillators . on the contrary , visibility @xmath62 and predictability",
    "@xmath73 involve a thermal harmonic average of products like @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "since the transition operator ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) contains only exponentials linear in the displacement , taking the trace amounts to gaussian integration .",
    "at zero temperature , the atoms are initially in their respective harmonic oscillator ground states . in other words ,",
    "the detectors are prepared in pure states . setting @xmath76 in ( [ d_and_v ] ) permits to show that in this case the duality relation is always saturated : @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we can use the visibility @xmath62 , much easier to calculate than the distinguishability @xmath63 , in order to understand how much which - way information is present and how it is encoded . carrying out the thermal average , we find in the limit @xmath78 @xmath79 neglecting higher - order terms @xmath80 in the two relevant small parameters defined as",
    "follows : the influence of atomic recoil without harmonic trapping is encoded in the factor @xmath81 with @xmath82 the recoil energy , @xmath83 the probe detuning from the atomic resonance , and @xmath84 as before .",
    "the harmonic trap enters through the parameter @xmath85 it is worthwile to discuss the physical significance of both parameters .",
    "let us first consider a very shallow trap @xmath86 where the free recoil effect described by @xmath87 dominates . at least to order @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 .",
    "together with the general property @xmath90 ( read : the _ a priori _ information can not be larger than the total available information ) this implies that all which - way information is actually available _ a priori _ : @xmath91 . just as in the case of other asymmetric interferometers ,",
    "this predictability is due to unbalanced scattering amplitudes . at perpendicular scattering @xmath92 ,",
    "the situation is completely symmetric , and both paths are equally probable .",
    "but for the extreme case @xmath93 of atoms in line with the probe , the atom in front scatters either the incident probe photon at the laser frequency or the already scattered photon on its way out again , now at laser frequency minus twice the recoil .",
    "a different frequency generally implies a different scattering cross section such that the two paths have different probabilities . for a given position configuration ,",
    "this information is known _ a priori _ without the necessity to perform any measurement .",
    "more quantitatively , the relative change in the resonant cross section @xmath94^{-1}$ ] under a small frequency change @xmath95 then is @xmath96 , one finds exactly @xmath97 . to this order",
    ", the predictability vanishes at exact detuning , since a small frequency change on the flat top of the resonance lorentzian has no effect .",
    "let us now interpret the influence of harmonic trapping at zero temperature .",
    "the predictability ( [ predzero ] ) contains no contribution in @xmath98 , which indicates that this parameter encodes which - path information that may only be revealed _ a posteriori _ by an appropriate measurement on the detector . in a temporal picture ( see fig .",
    "[ atomicoverlap.fig](b ) ) , one can determine which way the photon has taken if one can measure which atom has scattered the photon first .",
    "this is only possible if the initial position uncertainty @xmath25 is smaller than the distance @xmath99 travelled by the first scattering atom .",
    "more quantitatively , the first scatterer takes up the recoil in the direction of @xmath100 and travels the distance @xmath101{2\\hbar { { \\omega_\\ab{rec } } } / m}}\\delta t $ ] during the whole time @xmath102 until the emission of the final photon by the second atom .",
    "is simply twice the total contribution per atom that can be justified by a stationary - phase argument if both the wigner time delay of the phase and the amplitude change of the resonant scattering function @xmath103 are taken into account .",
    "] at that moment , the second atom receives the same recoil in the direction @xmath100 , such that the final momentum states for both ways become indistinguishable ( note that the recoil in the direction joining the atoms is exchanged instantaneously , because we can neglect the propagation time ) .",
    "the zero - temperature position uncertainty is the oscillator length @xmath104 , which finally shows that which - path information is indeed present on the scale @xmath105 .",
    "on the steep slope of a resonance curve implies a large scattering cross section difference @xmath106 that can provide which - path information .",

    "we thus have to calculate visibility and distinguishability separately .",
    "after the gaussian thermal average , the visibility is given in terms of a product of amplitudes like ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) for way a and b. it can be evaluated numerically for all values of the detuning @xmath108 and of the thermal trap parameter @xmath109 this parameter corresponds to the zero - temperature trap parameter ( [ zeta ] ) at effective oscillator excitation @xmath110 { { \\omega_\\ab{ho } } } $ ] , with @xmath111^{-1}$ ] the bose - einstein distribution function . for highly excited atoms",
    "@xmath112 the oscillator frequency drops out of the definition of the thermal trap parameter which becomes @xmath113 the classical thermal doppler shift ( @xmath114 ) in units of the linewidth .",

    ", we concentrate on the effect of harmonic trapping at finite temperature and neglect the free recoil contribution , which is justified if @xmath116 . the visibility decreases monotonically with temperature . for @xmath117",
    ", we can expand to lowest order and find analytically ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ distzero ] ) ) : @xmath118 at this point , we recover the case of free thermal atoms .",
    "our result ( [ visfinal ] ) agrees with the cbs contrast calculated in @xcite for the low - temperature case @xmath119 ( if the avarage medium effect included there is disregarded ) .",
    "note that our calculation is also valid in the high - temperature regime @xmath120 where the visibility goes to zero as @xmath121 .",
    "it is too difficult to evaluate analytically the trace - class norm for the distinguishability @xmath63 with the transition operators in the general form ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) .",
    "therefore , we formally expand the exponentials in powers of the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath122 { { { \\omega_\\ab{rec } } } / { { \\omega_\\ab{ho } } } } } $ ] . the leading order expression for @xmath63 in the shallow - trap limit @xmath112",

    "it is reasonable that only this mode should be relevant : symmetric motion can not encode differential information about the paths ( and could be disposed of by transformation into a co - moving frame ) , whereas the momentum along the only other available direction @xmath126 is exchanged instantaneously . to linear order in @xmath127 ,",
    "the positive operator @xmath128 can be moved outside the absolute value ( using @xmath129 since @xmath130 and @xmath131 commute to zeroth order in @xmath132 ) .",
    "this makes the distinguishability proportional to the thermal expectation value of the momentum modulus , which is easy to evaluate for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution : @xmath133 it can be read as the relative shift @xmath134 of the resonant cross section under the small doppler frequency change @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests an interpretation in terms of the frequency - shift mechanism ( cf .",
    "fig.[visibility.fig](a ) ) : by measuring the actual atomic velocities _ a posteriori _ , one can determine which way was more probable : if atom 1 is found to move towards a red - detuned probe and atom 2 to move away from it , way a was more probable than b because atom 1 had a larger absorption cross section  this is simply the principle of doppler cooling .",
    "contrary to the zero - temperature case , now the predictability @xmath136 is zero to the order considered because the interferometer symmetry is reestablished by the isotropic thermal average . naturally , as in the case of harmonic trapping at zero temperature , the distinguishability vanishes also at exact resonance @xmath107 because no differential information can be encoded on the flat top of the resonance lorentzian . in the high - temperature limit @xmath137 ,",
    "i.e. , for very large frequence shifts @xmath138 with moderate detuning , one explores the flat wings of the lorentzian , and the distinguishability must then drop to zero .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the quantum duality is no longer saturated and reads to order @xmath115 : @xmath139    \\left(\\frac { 2 k_\\ab{in } { { v_\\ab{rms } } } } { |\\gamma| } \\right)^2    .\\ ] ] this value of @xmath63 assumes an optimal measurement within just the system of center - of - mass motion .",
    "but the initial thermal distribution requires the presence of a thermal bath ( e.g. , cooling lasers ) .",
    "the total system ( detector plus bath ) is described by a pure state for which the quantum duality saturates .",
    "however , the which - path information could only be retrieved by an optimal measurement including all bath degrees of freedom that are not under our control .",
    "measurements on just the detector necessarily correspond to a non - optimal measurement with respect to the whole system and therefore imply a reduced distinguishability .",
    "we have studied the coherent backscattering effect from two trapped atoms , an interesting case study for quantitative quantum duality in a physically realistic setting . at zero temperature ,",
    "inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides _ a priori _ which - path information .",
    "further which - path information can be gained by measuring which atom has scattered the photon first , which is possible if the initial position uncertainty is small enough . at finite temperature , the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width .",
    "which - path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions , but the duality inequality no longer saturates because an initial thermal state corresponds to a non - optimal detector preparation .",
