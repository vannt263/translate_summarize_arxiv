    "investigation of the properties of the tensor mesons is an area where experimental data is well ahead of the theoretical works . in this area",
    "there are a little theoretical works devoted to the analysis of the main characteristics of the tensor mesons ( especially strange tensor mesons ) and their decay modes comparing with scaler , pseudo - scalar , vector and axial vector mesons",
    ". therefore , theoretical calculations on the physical parameters of these mesons and their comparison with experimental data could give essential information about their nature .",
    "the light tensor mesons spectroscopy can also be useful for understanding of low energy qcd .",
    "the qcd sum rules method as one of the most powerful and applicable tools to hadron physics could play an important role in this respect .",
    "hadrons are formed in a scale of energy where the perturbation theory fails and to study the physics of mesons , we need to use some non - perturbative approaches .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach @xcite , which enjoys two peculiar properties namely its foundation based on qcd lagrangian and free of model dependent parameters , as one of the most well established non - perturbative methods has been applied widely to hadron physics .",
    "present work is devoted to the analysis of mass and decay constant of the strange tensor @xmath0 with quantum numbers @xmath1 by means of the qcd sum rules .",
    "the @xmath0 tensor meson together with the unflavored @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are building the groundstate @xmath6 nonet , which are experimentally well established in contrast to the scalar mesons @xcite .",
    "note that , the mass and decay constant of light unflavored tensor mesons have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to estimate the order of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effects .",
    "recently , the magnetic moments of these mesons have also been predicted in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in the next section , the sum rules for the mass and decay constant of the ground state strange tensor meson is calculated .",
    "section iii encompasses our numerical predictions for the mass and leptonic decay constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson .",
    "in this section , we calculate the mass and decay constant of the strange tensor meson in the framework of the qcd sum rules .",

    "( [ correl.func.1 ] ) . in qcd sum rules approach , this correlation function is calculated in two ways :    * phenomenological or physical part which is obtained by saturating the correlation function with a tower of mesons with the same quantum numbers as the interpolating current , * qcd or theoretical side which is obtained considering the internal structure of the hadrons , namely quarks and gluons and their interactions with each other and also the qcd vacuum . in this side",
    "the correlation function is calculated in deep euclidean region , @xmath17 , via operator product expansion ( ope ) where the short and long distance effects are separated .",
    "the former is calculated using the perturbation theory , whereas the latter is represented in terms of vacuum expectation values of the operators having different mass dimensions .",
    "the sum rules for decay constant of the ground state meson is obtained isolating it in phenomenological part , equating both representations of the correlation function and applying borel transformation to suppress the contribution of the higher states and continuum .",
    "first , let us start to compute the physical side .",
    "inserting a complete set of @xmath0 state between the currents in eq .",
    "( [ correl.func.1 ] ) , setting @xmath18 and performing intergal over x we obtain : @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the higher states and continuum contributions .",
    "the matrix elements creating the hadronic states out of vacuum can be written in terms of the leptonic decay constant and polarization tensor as follows : @xmath21 combining two above equations and performing summation over polarization tensor using the relation @xmath22 where , @xmath23 we obtain the following final representation of the correlation function in physical side : @xmath24 where , we have kept only structure which contains a contribution of the tensor meson .",
    "on qcd side , the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ correl.func.1 ] ) is calculated using the explicit expression of the interpolating current presented in eq .",
