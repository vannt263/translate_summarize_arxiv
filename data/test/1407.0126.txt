    "many quantum phenomena , often radically different from our intuitive predictions , are attributed to the fundamental principle of quantum superposition that a physical system can be in a linear superposition of two distinct states . when the principle of quantum superposition is applied to multipartite physical systems",
    ", it manifests another interesting feature of quantum mechanics , namely quantum entanglement .",
    "quantum entanglement is nonclassical correlation between local systems and is now widely referred to as a key resource for quantum information processing .",
    "quantum phenomena are observed typically on microscopic scales .",
    "however , as illustrated in schrdinger s famous cat paradox @xcite , quantum mechanics does not preclude , in principle , the possibility of a macroscopic object being in a quantum superposition or being a part of quantum entanglement .",
    "natural questions then follow .",
    "if `` macroscopic _ and _ quantum '' is somehow a possible combination , how can we define , characterize and quantify `` macroscopic quantumness '' or `` quantum macroscopicity '' ?",
    "further , how and to what extent can we implement such macroscopic quantumness ?    of course , scientists have tried to answer these questions . in the early days of quantum mechanics ,",
    "such attempts were primarily in the area of interpretations or philosophical discussions , as they are not within the reach of experimental tests or implementations .",
    "since then , however , a remarkable development of quantum and atom optics has been brought about , which has paved a way to control and detect individual quantum systems at the level of single photons and atoms .",
    "based on this progress , further efforts are being made to collectively control larger quantum systems , that is also closely related to the ability to perform quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "now , we may say that a significant amount of efforts made in physics and optics research in the last few decades are more or less related to explorations of macroscopic quantumness . in this paper",
    ", we review two major research topics on macroscopic quantumness  its quantifications and physical implementations using optical fields  and attempt to make remarks on them .",
    "we want to know whether and/or how much a physical system is _ both _ macroscopic _ and _ quantum .",
    "needless to say , it is not sufficient for a state to be either macroscopic or quantum",
    ". it should be _ quantum - mechanically macroscopic _ or _ macroscopically quantum_. this point may sound too obvious to make , but it is nontrivial to technically define and quantify macroscopic quantumness .",
    "leggett posed a question along this line as `` what is the correct measure of ` schrdingers - cattiness ' ? '' and commented , `` ideally , one would like a quantitative measure which corresponds to our intuitive sense '' @xcite .",
    "a number of proposals have been made for quantification of macroscopic quantum superpositions @xcite based on the effective number of particles that involve the superposition @xcite , distinguishability between the constituent states @xcite and operational interpretations @xcite . in the context of this paper",
    ", we would like to pose three requirements for a desirable measure of macroscopic quantumness .",
    "first , it should be applicable to a wide range of states , not limited to a specific type of states .",
    "second , we prefer to have a measure that quantifies the degree of a genuine superposition against a classical mixture , together with its effective size factor . in other words , it should be applicable not only to pure states but also to mixed states .",
    "third , if a state is given , the degree should be unambiguously determined .",
    "these points are important because our motivation is to compare different types of states being considered as candidates for macroscopic quantum superpositions using a conclusive measure . in view of these points",
    ", we shall review in chronological order such measures proposed to quantify macroscopic quantumness .      in 1980 ,",
    "leggett in his pioneering work defined a measure called  disconnectivity \" @xmath0 @xcite that quantifies genuine multipartite quantum correlations .",
    "suppose that we are interested in characterizing an @xmath1-mode bosonic system @xmath2 .",
    "we first obtain a reduced density operator @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) from @xmath5 by tracing out every mode except for @xmath6 arbitrarily chosen modes .",

    ", @xmath7 is set to be @xmath10 when both the numerator and the denominator are zero , and @xmath11 .",
    "the disconnectivity @xmath0 is defined as the largest integer @xmath6 that makes @xmath7 the smallest .",
    "for an ideal greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath12 with an orthogonal basis @xmath13 , it is clear that @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . its disconnectivity is then @xmath17 that is the largest @xmath6 minimizing @xmath7 to be @xmath18 .",
    "however , @xmath0 is always @xmath10 for mixed states @xmath19 regardless of the values of @xmath1 and @xmath20 as far as @xmath21 .",
    "this means that macroscopic quantumness for partially mixed states can not be identified by @xmath0 .",
    "leggett pointed out that so called  macroscopic quantum phenomena \" such as superconductivity or superfluidity do not require the existence of a high-@xmath0 state .",
    "superfluidity can be explained by a product of identical bosonic states of which disconnectivity is obviously @xmath10 .",
    "a superconducting system described by @xmath1 cooper pairs , @xmath22 , also shows a small value of disconnectivity @xmath23 regardless of @xmath1 . on the other hand , multi - mode quantum correlations , in the form of pure states ,",
    "always give large values of @xmath0 .    even though disconnectivity sensibly quantifies multipartite correlations for pure states",
    ", it is not always sensitive to distinguishability between the constituent states",
    ". this point shall be clearer in the following example discussed by dr _",

    "it would be of particular interest to know whether @xmath29 can still be a macroscopic superposition in comparison to an ideal ghz state when @xmath26 takes a small value . to put it concretely",
    ", they attempt to find out what size of the ideal ghz state ( i.e. @xmath30 ) state @xmath29 is equivalent to .",
    "two different methods lead to the same result that the effective size of state @xmath29 as a macroscopic superposition approaches @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "the first method is based on the rate of decoherence and the second is related to the ghz entanglement distillation by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "consider a dephasing process that is described by a completely positive map @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is time , @xmath36 is the dephasing rate , and @xmath37 is the pauli-@xmath38 operator . they show that the trace - norm of the off - diagonal elements for state @xmath29 is @xmath39 when @xmath32 and that it is @xmath40 for state @xmath30 . based on this comparison",
    ", they conclude that the effective size of the generalized ghz state @xmath29 is equivalent to that of an ideal ghz state @xmath30 of size @xmath31 for small values of @xmath26 .",
    "this conclusion is also derived from depolarizing decoherence where it gives exactly the same decay rate .",

    "( [ eq : gen - ghz ] ) .",
    "bjrk and mana s suggestion @xcite is based on their observation that a quantum superposition is more sensitive than its constituent states for interferometric applications .",
    "let us consider a pure state @xmath41 with a measurement outcome distribution of observable @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a function of a reasonably smooth form centered at @xmath45 with width @xmath46 .",
    "the operator @xmath47 is applied to state @xmath48 where @xmath49 corresponds to the degree of the interaction time and strength . generally , the overlap between the original and evolved states is @xmath50 which becomes zero when @xmath51 . in other words ,",

    "the measure of a macroscopic superposition in terms of interferometric sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the two interaction times : @xmath58 bjrk and mana s approach has a distinguishing feature as an operational measure based on a physical application even though it is devised only for pure states .",
