    "the integrability problem for systems of first order odes is indeed a relevant issue in the theory of dynamical systems ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) , and the same question for coupled systems of odes could be also meaningful from the viewpoint of applications ( for instance , regarding synchronization problems  @xcite ) . in this context , the aim of this paper is two fold : on one hand , to present a novel approach to the explicit construction of liouville  integrable coupled systems of odes endowed with lie  poisson symmetries and , on the other hand , to show how integrable deformations of the previous systems can be systematically obtained .",
    "the construction here presented establishes a ( to the best of our knowledge ) novel connection between poisson ",
    "lie groups and integrable deformations of dynamical systems .",
    "such a link is based on the well - known result by drinfeld that establishes the one - to - one correspondence between poisson  lie groups and lie bialgebras  @xcite , as well as on the general construction of integrable hamiltonian systems from poisson coalgebras that was introduced in  @xcite , thus giving rise to the so - called  coalgebra symmetry approach \" to finite dimensional integrable systems ( see  @xcite for applications of this method to hnon  heiles and lotka  volterra systems , respectively , and  @xcite for the coalgebra  based construction of nonlinear superposition rules arising in nonautonomous lie ",
    "hamilton systems  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we will apply the formalism here introduced in order to obtain new integrable deformations of certain lorenz  @xcite and rssler  @xcite systems , as well as of some coupled versions of them .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the method presented in the paper is completely general and could be applied to any other interesting hamiltonian systems of odes endowed with a lie  poisson symmetry .",

    ", @xmath9 . then , since lie ",
    "poisson algebras are endowed with a ( primitive or non  deformed ) coalgebra structure , the coalgebra symmetry approach will straightforwardly provide , by following  @xcite , a coupled integrable generalization of the system .",
    "this approach will be illustrated in section 3 through the explicit construction of an integrable coupled rssler system .    a detailed technical presentation of the construction of poisson ",
    "lie groups as deformations of lie bialgebras will be given in section 4 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath10 the abstract lie algebra associated with the lie ",
    "poisson coalgebra @xmath3 , we will assume that we are able to find a cocommutator map @xmath11 compatible with @xmath10 , so that @xmath12 defines a lie bialgebra structure  @xcite .",
    "then , it is well  known that the dual of the cocommutator @xmath11 will define a second lie algebra structure ( that we will denote by @xmath13 ) , and the dual of the structure tensor for @xmath14 will provide a compatible cocommutator map @xmath15 for @xmath13 , in such a way that @xmath16 is just the dual lie bialgebra to @xmath12 .",
    "once a given @xmath17 is identified , the ( connected component containing the identity ) of the lie group @xmath18 with lie algebra @xmath13 can be constructed by exponentiation , and the unique poisson  lie structure having @xmath19 as its linearization at the identity can be computed , thus providing the deformed poisson structure @xmath20 we were looking for .",
    "simultaneously , the group law for @xmath18 will give us the explicit deformed coproduct map @xmath21 on the algebra of smooth functions @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the deformation nature of this construction arises in a more transparent way if we consider the one - parametric cocommutator @xmath23 , since the parameter @xmath24 will give us information concerning the orders in the deformation process that arises from the ` exponentiation '  of the tangent lie bialgebra structure .",
    "it is worth to be stressed that the procedure that we have just sketched is algorithmic and can be made fully explicit by making use of symbolic computation packages .",
    "therefore , as a poisson coalgebra , @xmath25 can be interpreted as a smooth @xmath24deformation of @xmath26 on which the initial dynamical system with hamiltonian function @xmath27 is defined . as a consequence ,",
    "if we consider the same hamiltonian function @xmath27 on @xmath25 , then the associated dynamical system is just an integrable @xmath24deformation of the initial system of odes .",
    "moreover , the coalgebra symmetry approach  @xcite guarantees that the set of involutive functions for the deformed system will be given by the deformed coproducts of the hamiltonian @xmath27 and of the deformed casimir functions @xmath28 for the poisson structure @xmath20 , with @xmath29 .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted to use this poisson - deformation approach in order to obtain integrable deformations of two coupled rssler and lorenz systems , respectively .",
    "it is worth stressing that , as a result of the exponentiation process that underlies the full construction , such integrable deformations of dynamical systems are provided by non ",
    "polynomial vector fields , which is a non ",
    "standard finding from the viewpoint of integrability . also , the underlying poisson  lie groups are responsible of the fact that the coupling between the systems is quite involved , since such coupling is generated by their non  abelian group law .",
