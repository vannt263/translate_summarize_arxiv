    "determining distances to galactic objects ( hii regions , pulsars ( psr ) and supernova remnants ( snr ) etc . ) may help understand the kinematics of the milky way .",
    "also , distance measurement of snrs is a key to obtain their basic parameters such as the luminosity , size and age . as an energetic class of objects ,",
    "snrs are associated with many highly active astrophysical phenomena , e.g. anomalous x - ray pulsars , soft @xmath3-ray repeaters , pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , non - thermal x - rays and very - high - energy @xmath3-rays ( see yang et al .",
    "2008 for a review ) .",
    "the determination of distance of a snr may test reality of a snr / psr / pwn or snr / tev @xmath3-ray source association , and help constrain the mass range of the progenitor star and type of supernova responsible for the remnant .",
    "it can provide direct evidence whether a snr is physically associated with molecular clouds , or if strong interaction between a snr shock and surrounding clouds is possible , which is widely believed to be a source of tev @xmath3-ray and non - thermal x - ray emission in the milky way .",
    "the snr / molecular cloud interaction may also potentially lead to new generations of star formation , so constitutes an important part of galactic ecology .    comparing hi absorption spectra toward galactic snrs with respective hi and @xmath0co emission spectra along the line of sight , we previously revised distances to five snrs and several overlapping hii regions ( tian et al . 2007 ; tian & leahy 2008 ; leahy & tian 2008a ; ) . some values differ greatly from previously published values , e.g. kes 75 ( leahy & tian 2008b ) , pwn g54.1 + 0.3 ( leahy , tian & wang 2008 ) , because our methods implement improved background subtraction and spurious emission rejection , and resolve the near / far distance ambiguity in the inner galaxy , which may have been previously done incorrectly .",
    "the distance changes can result in significant changes in interpretation of the snr ( and associated object ) properties .",
    "as the newest paper of a series , we use the methods to directly re - measure distances of two more snrs : kes 69 which has 1720 mhz oh maser emission ( hewitt et al . 2008 ) , and g21.5 - 0.9 which hosts a young pulsar ( camilo et al .",
    "2006 ; bietenholz & bartel 2008 ) and also has tev @xmath3-ray emission ( i.e. hess j1833 - 105 , djannati - atai et al .",
    "1720 mhz masers are associated with warm , shocked molecular gas and are seen as signposts of snr - molecular cloud interactions ( wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) , therefore they likely give reliable distance estimates to snr / molecular cloud systems .",
    "an oh maser at velocity of 69.3@xmath40.7 km s@xmath2 ( hereafter , we use @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2to describe the radial velocity of this maser ) was detected toward kes 69 ( green et al .",
    "1997 ) , leading to a distance of @xmath1 11.2 kpc for the remnant . however , the masers site is outside of the northeastern radio and x - ray shells of kes 69 ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "this spurred us to re - measure its distance by analyzing hi+@xmath0co spectra in the direction of kes 69 in order to test the reality of the claimed association .",
    "snr g21.5 - 0.9 is an interesting snr nearby kes 69 , so we also analyze hi and co spectra in the direction of g21.5 - 0.9 .    in this paper , we significantly revise the distance to kes 69 , and refine the distance estimation to g21.5 - 0.9 by analyzing hi and co spectra .",
    "we use the galactic rotation curve model and recent measurements of the parameters for this ( i.e. r@xmath5 8 kpc , eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ; v@xmath6@xmath1 220 km s@xmath2 , feast & whitelock 1997 , reid & brunthaler 2004 ) .",
    "the radio data come from 1420 mhz continuum plus hi - line observations of the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps , stil et al .",
    "2006 ) and the @xmath0co - line ( j = 1 - 0 ) observations of the galactic ring survey ( jackson et al .",
    "2006 ) of the five college radio astronomy observatory 14 m telescope .",
    "the short - spacing information for the hi spectral line images is from additional observations with the 100 m green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the national radio astronomical observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the vla 1420 mhz continuum image of kes 69 , g21.5 - 0.9 and background compact source pmn j1832 - 1035 ( i.e. g21.35 - 0.63 ) is shown in fig . 1 ( upper left ) .",
    "we have searched the vgps radial velocity range from -113 to 165 km s@xmath2 for features in the hi emission which might be related to the morphology of the two snrs .",
    "some negative hi features are found to be strongly correlated with the continuum intensity of the snrs , indicating that they are caused by absorption in hi between the snr and the earth ( see the hi channel images shown in the second and third rows of fig .",
    "1 ) . a co channel image is also given in fig . 1 ( upper right ) .",
    "the continuum image clearly reveals that the site of the 1720 mh oh maser at @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2 is outside of the detected radio emission of kes 69 ( marked by the plus in the first panel of fig .",
    "the co channel image shows that a cloud at velocity of @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 overlaps kes 69 , which is likely responsible for producing the clear hi dip in the hi channel image at @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 at the location of the brightest continuum emission from kes 69 .",
    "this means that the co cloud should be adjacent to or in front of kes 69 . the hi channel image at @xmath1 112 km s@xmath2 , which is close to the tangent point velocity of @xmath1 120 km s@xmath2 in the direction towards kes 69 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , shows that an hi cloud overlaps kes 69 , but does nt produce any absorption from kes 69 , so the hi cloud is behind kes 69 .    the hi channel image at @xmath1 67 km s@xmath2 shows that hi covers kes 69 , g21.5 - 0.9 and pmn j1832 - 1035 , and produces absorption for each source .",
    "so the hi cloud is in front of all three sources .",
    "other hi at @xmath1 69 km s@xmath2 ( the lower left panel of fig .",
    "1 ) yields an upper limit distance to g21.5 - 0.9 because it covers all three sources , and produces absorption from kes 69 and pmn j1832 - 1035 but not from g21.5 - 0.9 .",
    "we construct hi emission and absorption spectra of both snrs and of pmn j1832 - 1035 in order to verify the above results in more detail .",
    "the extraction regions for these spectra are shown by the boxes in the first panel of fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath0co emission spectra from boxes 1 , 2 , 3 and from the oh maser site are also analyzed .",
    "these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "we note that the co ( molecular cloud ) emission features all have associated hi emission features indicating hi associated with h@xmath7 , likely due to the atomic envelope of the molecular cloud .",
    "several hi emission features have no associated co emission ( i.e. h@xmath7 ) , as many atom clouds have no molecular component .",
    "the highest velocity of absorption to kes 69 is @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 at which there is a co cloud ( see first and second rows of fig .",
    "the hi spectra of kes 69 show a prominent hi emission feature at @xmath1 112 km s@xmath2 with no respective absorption . these give a strict distance constraint to kes 69 ,",
    "i.e. kes 69 is in the range of distance of 5.5 kpc to 7.4 kpc .",
    "the @xmath0co spectrum of the oh maser site near kes 69 shows little @xmath0co emission at @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2 ( above 0.2 k , see the lower right panel ) , showing there is no high column density cloud .",
    "however this can not exclude there still possibly exists a small high density cloud at the oh maser site at 70 km s@xmath2 .    for g21.5 - 0.9 ,",
    "the highest velocity of hi absorption is @xmath1 67 km s@xmath2 at which there is a co cloud ( third row of fig .",
    "another co cloud at @xmath1 74 km s@xmath2 does not produce any respective hi absorption , so this cloud is behind g21.5 - 0.9 .",
    "further , the hi absorption spectra of both nearby pmn j1832 - 1035 and kes 69 show a strong absorption feature at velocity of @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these strongly support the above hi channel image analysis and constrain the distance , i.e. g21.5 - 0.9 is between clouds at velocities of @xmath1 67 km s@xmath2 and @xmath1 69 km s@xmath2 , i.e. d @xmath1 4.8 kpc for velocity of @xmath1 68 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the oh - maser determined distance should be reasonably consistent with the hi+co determined distance to the same snr .",
    "we note that distances are derived here from a circular rotation model , and contain errors due to uncertainties in the rotation model and non - circular motions .",
    "e.g. using the observed @xmath8 diagram , weiner & sellwood ( 1999 ) derived the radial velocity distribution in the inner galaxy . applying to kes 69 ,",
    "the distances are reduced by @xmath1 0.4 kpc compared to the circular rotation model . observed random motion of up to 7 km s@xmath2 ( shaveret al .",
    "1982 ) yields a distance uncertainty of @xmath1 0.3 kpc for this case . using the circular rotation model",
    ", our analysis of the hi+co spectra reveals that kes 69 has a distance of 5.5 to 7.4 kpc , far smaller than 11.2 kpc determined by the oh maser at 70 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is strong evidence against the oh maser being associated with kes 69 .",
    "this is supported by further evidence : the site of the oh maser is outside the detected radio emission of kes 69 , and no co emission at @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2 is seen in the co spectrum of the oh maser .",
    "a collisional pumping model shows that shock - excited oh maser emission at 1720 mhz appearing behind a snr shock front results from the interaction of an snr with an adjacent , warm , dense shocked molecular cloud ( wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) .    furthermore , an extended 1720 mhz oh maser at velocity of @xmath1 85 km s@xmath2 has been detected from within the bright southern radio shell of kes 69 by gbt and vla observations ( hewitt et al .",
    "the new oh maser fits nicely with the highest velocity of hi absorption in the direction of kes 69 , therefore we conclude that kes 69 is located at a distance of @xmath1 5.5 kpc at the near side kinematic distance for the oh maser at @xmath1 85 km s@xmath2 and consistent with the highest observed hi absorption velocity of @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 . a bright @xmath0co cloud at @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 overlapping kes",
    "69 has been revealed here ( fig . 1",
    "upper right ) .",
    "a research group from nan jing university newly finds @xmath9co , @xmath0 co and hco@xmath10 emissions near 85 km / s@xmath2 from the bright southern shell ( zhou et al .",
    "2008 ) , consistent with the previous formaldehyde molecular ( h@xmath7co ) and the 1665/7 mhz oh absorption line observations at velocities of 82  87 km s@xmath2 ( wilson 1972 , turner 1970 ) . all these support our conclusion on the distance of 5.5 kpc to kes 69 .",
    "so the 1720 mhz maser at 70 km s@xmath2 is likely not associated with kes 69 .",
    "g21.5 - 0.9 is located between a cloud at velocity of @xmath1 67 km s@xmath2 and that of @xmath1 69 km s@xmath2 ( i.e. d @xmath1 4.8 kpc ) .",
    "g21.5 - 0.9 hosts a young pulsar pwn j1833 - 1034 .",
    "new measurement refines the most recent velocity measurement to the snr / psr system by camilo et al .",
    "2006 who analyzed hi spectra data from the vla and the leiden / dwingeloo 25 m telescope observations , and lower resolution @xmath9co data from the cfa 1.2 m telescope observations , to obtain lower and upper limits on the velocity of 65 km s@xmath2 and 76 km s@xmath2 ( i.e. d @xmath1 4.7@xmath4 0.4 kpc ) .",
    "the 1420 mhz continuum map shows kes 69 has a roughly elliptical outline 26@xmath11 by 20@xmath11 whereas the rosat pspc image ( yusef - zadeh et al . 2003 ) , also elliptical and oriented in the same way , has smaller dimensions of 20@xmath11 by 13@xmath11 .",
    "this is mainly due to absence of x - rays from the northwest radio filament ( upper left side in fig . 1 here ) and from the northeast radio wing ( lower left in fig .",
    "1 ) , but also the x - rays do not extend out to the edge of the main radio filament in the south . we use 20@xmath11 as the mean angular diameter of kes 69 , which is the mean of radio and x - ray values . at the distance of 5.5 kpc ,",
    "the diameter is @xmath1 32 pc .",
    "we apply a sedov model ( cox 1972 ) to estimate the parameters of kes 69 , using the rosat pspc temperature of 1.6 kev and x - ray luminosity of 8.4@xmath12 erg / s ( yusef - zadeh et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the high temperature and moderate x - ray luminosity are indicative of explosion in a low density medium .",
    "application of the sedov model yields an age of 5000 years , an explosion energy of 0.8@xmath13 erg , and a pre - explosion density of @xmath10.1 @xmath14 . based on the estimated errors in the rosat pspc spectral parameters , the errors in these values are @xmath160% for age and explosion energy and @xmath130% for density .",
    "these results are consistent with observation of oh maser emission from the main south filament of kes 69 if the explosion occurred in a moderately low density cavity ( @xmath10.1 @xmath14 ) and has only recently ( @xmath15 5000 years ago ) run into dense molecular gas at the main southern filament .",
    "supporting this are spitzer infrared observations of line emissions from shocked molecular gas in kes 69 ( reach et al . 2006 ) . for the rosat temperature of 1.6 kev ,",
    "the snr shock velocity is 1250 km s@xmath2 in 0.1 @xmath14 gas , but is slowed down to @xmath1 4 km s@xmath2 in cold molecular gas with density of @xmath1 @xmath16 @xmath14 .",
    "the shock would still be supersonic , since the sound speed is 0.2 to 0.6 km s@xmath2 in 10 to 100 k molecular hydrogen , and would result in mild heating of the gas to @xmath1 4000 k. this would subsequently result in good conditions for production of the observed oh maser emission ( wardle 1999 ) .    in summary",
    ", we significantly revise the distance to kes 69 and obtain a better distance to g21.5 - 0.9 , by an analysis using hi and @xmath0co spectra .",
    "the evolutionary state of kes 69 is evaluated , and it is consistent with a moderate aged snr , just recently encountering a dense molecular cloud .",
