    "the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc6369  shown in fig.[n2ima ] in the light of h@xmath0+n[ii]@xmath3658.4 nm  is an object with a complex morphology , consisting of a main bright annulus of diameter 40 , and fainter , curved outer structures on two sides in the e - w direction .",
    "deep narrow band h@xmath0 and n[ii]@xmath36584 images of ngc6369 were obtained by @xcite in a survey to look for faint outer halos around pne . apart from being deeper , their image is not significantly different from the one shown in fig.1 , and no large faint halo was found .",
    "the hst image of ngc6369 available at http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/25/index.html also shows the same main features as our image but has additional resolved details , and tags the h@xmath0 , [ oiii]500.7 nm , and [ nii]658.4 nm lines with the colors red , blue and green respectively . in the section on observational results",
    "we discuss this composite hst image in more detail .",
    "+ [ nii ] from @xcite .",
    "note the bright ring and outer faint ansae to the e and w of the object .",
    "n is up , e to the left , and the plate scale is 0.26  /pix .",
    "[ n2ima ] ]    the equatorial and galactic coordinates for ngc6369 are @xmath0 = 17@xmath429@xmath520@xmath6.40 and @xmath7 = 23@xmath84537.9 ( icrs2000 ) , and l = 2.43@xmath8",
    "b = + 5.85@xmath8 respectively .",
    "the extreme distances determined for ngc6369 are 0.33kpc obtained by @xcite , and 2.00kpc obtained by @xcite , out of a total of 10 listed by @xcite , from which we obtain a mean value for the distance to ngc6369 of 1039@xmath9 538 pc .",
    "note that these ten distances were determined using several statistical methods , each with their own systematic biases and assumptions , so that the average probably is a reasonably unbiased estimator , within the ( large ) error .",
    "the temperature of the central star obtained from the zanstra method by @xcite is @xmath10 .",
    "the star has been classified as a wc4 star by @xcite .",
    "spectra of ngc6369 were obtained by @xcite , using an ids ( image dissector scanner ) as detector with double 4  apertures , by @xcite using an its ( image tube scanner ) with a @xmath11 slit , and by @xcite using an ids and a combination of different apertures not bigger than @xmath12 .",
    "an expansion velocity of @xmath13 km s@xmath14 has been determined by @xcite .",
    "the system radial velocity was reported to be -106km.s@xmath14 by @xcite , and -101km.s@xmath14 by @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc6369 is shown in fig.[sed ] and has been computed using flux values from @xcite and @xcite over a range of wavelengths from 0.44 to 1100@xmath15 m .",
    "note that we plot @xmath3f@xmath16 against wavelength and below we will use the f@xmath16 values to determine the observed optical+ir luminosity of ngc6369 .",
    "m using flux values from the literature ( see text).[sed ] ]    planetary nebulae are generally classified according to their appearance , and such classification is then used for studies of the formation and evolution of these objects ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "such a classification , based on the observed two dimensional ( 2-d ) brightness distribution in a given line or lines can be quite misleading .",
    "this could be the case for ngc 6369 , for which a round morphology is evident from the observed images .",
    "different 3-d geometries can produce the same observed 2-d morphology as has been shown by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , images produced by ions of different ionization degree can be very different , due to the radiation transfer within the nebulae . only detailed modeling , which reproduces the brightness intensity distribution of different lines , as well other observed parameters , can provide more reliable information about the 3-d geometry of the gas distribution .",
    "the determination of the actual 3-d gas distribution in planetary nebulae is essential for understanding their formation and evolution , as well as that of the ionizing star .    by determining the 3-d structure of nebulae",
    ", we eliminate the large uncertainties that have plagued classical statistical distance determination methods for over 5 decades .",
    "assumptions about the filling factor , constancy of ionized mass or diameter , mass - radius relationships etc . are not needed here : we _ know _ what the structure and ionized mass are , and can therefore determine distances to much greater accuracy than before . in this paper",
    "we explain in detail how we can determine this 3-d structure from long slit spectra and our 3-d photo - ionization model , and apply it to the case of ngc6369    in summary , we obtain the spatial structure of the object along with its chemical composition , ionizing source temperature and luminosity , mass , as well as an _ independent _ distance , in a self - consistent manner . in ",
    "2 we discuss the observations and basic reduction procedures , as well as the details of the image reconstruction technique used to obtain the line intensity maps . in ",
    "3 the results obtained from these maps are discussed : the reddening correction of the images , total line fluxes and the computed temperature and density maps . in  4 we present the model results of the 3-d photoionization code , and we discuss the derived quantities finally , in  5 we give our conclusions .",
    "observations were made using the ctio 1.5 m ritchey - chrtien telescope with the rc spectrograph on the nights of 12 and 13th june , 2002 .",
    "we used a grating with 600l / mm blazed at 600 nm giving a spectral resolution of 0.65 nm per pixel and a plate scale of 1.3/pixel with a slit width of 4 . the spectral coverage obtained with",
    "this configuration was approximately 450 nm to 700 nm .",
    "we took three 1200s exposures at each slit position for ease of cosmic hit removal etc .. for details of the instrument and telescope see http://www.ctio.noao.edu and click on `` optical spectrographs '' , then on `` 1.5 m rc spectrograph '' .    by taking sets of exposures at several parallel long - slit positions across the nebula , we obtained line intensity profiles for each slit .",
    "these profiles were then combined to create emission line images of the nebula with a spatial resolution of about @xmath17 , in a way similar to radio mapping .",
    "this method has been applied before for the pn ngc3132 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a total of 10 positions were observed , moving the slit in 4steps in the n - s direction between exposures .",
    "the third position observed from south to north ( east is to the left , and north is up in all the figures ) was not observed due to pointing problems .",
    "for this position an average of the two adjacent exposures was adopted .",
    "the seeing conditions during the observing run were 1.5or better , obtained from the seeing monitor at ctio . in both nights the atmospheric conditions were photometric .",
    "the individual slit spectra were reduced using standard procedures for long - slit spectroscopy , using iraf reduction packages .",
    "the wavelength calibration was applied to the two dimensional images using the tasks fitcoords and transform after re - identifying the arc spectra in many spatial positions .",
    "this procedure helps to remove distortions in the image that may be present due to slit curvature and misalignment with respect to the ccd .",
    "the final corrected images show displacements of the order of one pixel , which is the precision limit of this method . an additional fine correction for slit misalignment",
    "was made using the h@xmath18 and h@xmath19 profiles for each exposure . using idl the images were re - dimensioned to 100 times their original size .",
    "the normalized h@xmath18 and h@xmath19 profiles were then matched and the final result re - dimensioned to original values .",
    "this procedure yields the precise alignment necessary for calculation of diagnostic line intensity ratios .",
    "minor shifts of the order of one pixel can introduce considerable errors in line ratios , if this method is not applied . the error introduced in line ratios by misalignments can reach 4% on sharp edges of the brightness profile .    for the flux calibrations two standard stars , ltt7379 and ltt9239",
    "were observed on both nights .",
    "the final sensitivity function obtained from these stars , using the iraf task sensfunc , has an rms of 0.02 , indicating the good photometric quality of the nights .",
    "based on previous similar spectrophotometric observations made with the int on la palma , we compute the _ random _ error on individual line flux calibrations to be 3% , while the overall possible _ systematic _ uncertainty in the stellar flux is about 5% .",
    "the final emission line images were obtained from the spatially integrated flux profile in each slit . to obtain the slit profile of integrated fluxes in a given transition , a gaussian function was fitted to each point along the spatial direction using idl routines .",
    "the errors adopted for the fits were the standard deviations calculated by the fitting procedure .",
    "the profiles for each slit position were then combined and interpolated using a cubic convolution algorithm @xcite , in order to reconstruct a 2-d image of the nebula for that transition .",
    "integration of this final image provides the total observed flux for the nebula , for each line .",
    "note that this procedure gives better estimates of the total flux and relative line intensities than observing just one slit position or aperture , since it takes into account the entire nebula .",
    "signal to noise images were also obtained using the fitted profiles by subtracting the fitted profile from the original section and analyzing the remaining noise .",
    "this is a combination of all noise sources in the image ( photon statistics , noise introduced by the data reduction procedures , etc . ) .",
    "these errors were then combined with the fitting errors mentioned above , using the usual error propagation expressions to make the final signal to noise image .",
    "we then quadratically added the 3% random calibration error and the de - reddening error computed from the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 reddening map ( see  3.1 ) , to arrive at the overall error for each line flux .",
    "this procedure provides precise error estimates for the total fluxes and diagnostic line ratio calculations .",
    "images were created for all 17 lines detected with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio . in fig.[maps_full ]",
    "the images for the most important lines are shown .",
    "the important [ oiii]436.3 nm line fell outside our available spectral range and could therefore not be included in our analysis .",
    "the images were corrected for reddening as described in the following section .",
    "the extracted total line intensities with their fractional total errors are given in table  1 .",
    "note that all main features are reproduced in these reconstructed line images .",
    "the outer ansae only show up in the [ nii]685.4 nm line , and are extremely faint or invisible in all other lines , as they are in the hst original images shown at http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/25/original.html the [ oiii]500.7 nm emission comes mainly from the central part of the bright ring - like structure , while h@xmath0 comes from further out , and the outermost part is dominated by [ nii]685.4 nm .",
    "clearly , we do not reproduce the fine detail visible in the hst image because of our effective spatial resolution of 4  in the observational data .",
    "however , the expected ionization stratification for the different ions and the overall nebular structure are clearly seen in our images .",
    "the reconstructed images for each line were corrected for reddening using the h@xmath18/h@xmath19 ratio map shown in fig.[ha / hb ] .",
    "the logarithmic correction constant was calculated pixel by pixel using the theoretical value of h@xmath18/h@xmath19=2.87 ( @xcite ) and the reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "we investigated the effect of differential atmospheric refraction on this ratio map . from the airmasses of our observed positions and",
    "the values given by @xcite we computed a correction which we applied to our data . since we used wide slits ( 4 ) and the object is extended , the effect was small , but not negligible in the steep gradients near the bright ring structure .",
    "the average error due to this effect is about 2% in the high signal to noise areas and about 20% in the low signal to noise areas .",
    "the nett effect on the final calculated relative total fluxes is about 0.2% for strong lines and of 5% for weak ones , well within the other observed uncertainties .",
    "in fig.[n2corrected ] we show the [ nii]658.4 nm image as an example before and after the reddening and differential refraction corrections .",

    "[ n2corrected ] ]    the reddening correction was also obtained from the spatially integrated fluxes calculated from the images .",
    "the h@xmath20 flux was divided by the h@xmath19 flux and a single value for the logarithmic extinction constant was obtained for the whole nebula .",
    "this value was then used to correct the total line intensities .",
    "the results for the line intensities were compared with those obtained from the first method and showed no differences to within the calculated uncertainties .",
    "the resulting emission line fluxes relative to h@xmath1 and their corresponding total errors are shown in table[line fluxes ] .",
    "all total fluxes were obtained by integrating the reddening corrected ( pixel by pixel ) images .",

    "we have presented spectrophotometric maps of ngc6369 . these maps provided spatially resolved information for many emission lines and precise total fluxes for the whole nebula .",
    "the images produced with this technique were used to study the nebula with the usual diagnostic ratios .",
    "each image was corrected for reddening pixel by pixel using the h@xmath18/h@xmath1 image .",
    "this correction lead to some significant differences between the corrected and uncorrected images , as was shown in figs.5 & 7 .",
    "the h@xmath18/h@xmath1 map shows some interesting features . in fig.4",
    "we show that the extinction is not uniform across the nebula , as it varies between 6 and 18 .",
    "the structure follows the main nebular morphology , which could indicate that dust and neutral material are present .",
    "this is to be expected since the nebula shows a very clumpy structure , which may cause shadowing within the gas , allowing for the survival of grains and neutral material .",
    "the prominent features on either side of the nebula do not show significant differences in extinction when compared to the main region .    the temperature map derived from the observed integrated line of sight intensities showed some structure but due to the low signal to noise ratio , this should be treated with caution . within the errors and resolution of our observations the temperature can be considered to be constant across the nebula .",
    "we also show that the density map indicates a decrease in density for the central regions .",
    "this decrease , as has been discussed by @xcite , is not compatible with a closed shell structure . based on this map",
    "we propose an hour - glass structure for the main nebula , which has reproduced all the observational features of ngc6369 .",
    "this indicates that the one needs to use the [ sii ] ratio in addition to images to distiguish between open and closed structures .",
    "the position of the outer condensations or ansae which are off - set by 30@xmath8 from the main nebular symmetry axis was obtained by matching model images with the observed line images ( fig.[maps_full ] ) as well as matching the model [ sii ] density map with the observed map ( fig.[dens_map ] ) .",
    "the presence of these condensations can be accounted for by earlier ejection of matter and precession can account for their deviation from the symmetry axis .",
    "many authors have dealt with these issues ; for more complete discussions and models see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      the total luminosity of the observed lines , l@xmath24=1150l@xmath2 ; that derived from the sed by integrating the f@xmath16 curve , l@xmath25=7.1@xmath2610@xmath27d@xmath28 where d is the distance to ngc6369 in pc , resulting in l@xmath25=1700l@xmath2 . correcting this value using the method of myers et al .",
    "( 1987 ) we obtain 2550l@xmath2 .",
    "the luminosity of the central star is l@xmath29=8100l@xmath2 so that the ratios of the line and optical+ir luminosities to the total luminosity are respectively : l@xmath24/l@xmath29=0.14 and l@xmath25/l@xmath29=0.3 . assuming that the absorbed flux is re - radiated in the ir , mainly the iras bands",
    ", the integrated optical+ir luminosity indicates that about 70% of the uv flux ( lyman continuum ) escapes from the nebula .",
    "this is not implausible as the nebula is open at it s `` poles '' and is clumpy , allowing the radiation to pass through the many `` holes '' .    from the input matter distribution and abundances used in the model ,",
    "we calculate the mass of the nebular ionized gas to be @xmath30 .",
    "if we now use our values of luminosity and temperature for the central star and compare them with the evolutionary models of @xcite we can obtain the mass of the central core . using this procedure we can see from fig.[evol_track ] that the best fitting track for our data corresponds to a mass somewhat higher than @xmath31 , say , @xmath32 , and to an initial mass of @xmath33 .",
    "if we sum our nebular and core masses , we obtain @xmath34 approximately .",
    "if we use the line intensity errors as a measure of the goodness of the model results and combine the luminosity and temperature errors we obtain approximately 20 - 25% for the uncertainty in @xmath35 , placing the obtained initial stellar mass within the uncertainty of our determination . the value for @xmath36 calculated from the model input density is a lower limit estimate of the total nebular mass as at least some material is present in the form of dust , as indicated qualitatively by our extinction map structure .",
    "additionally , there may be neutral gas for wich we have no constraints .",
    "note that typical parameters for a wc4 pn central star from @xcite are t=90kk , and r=0.4r@xmath2 , very close to our derived values of 91000k and 0.4r@xmath2 .",
    "using g = g.m / r@xmath28 in cgs units , we obtain log(g)=5.1 , which is much lower than the value of 5.8 derived from the depth of our he break .",
    "this is due to the fact that the central star has an extended atmosphere , again showing the consistency of the model results .      using our photoionization code and the proposed structure we obtained a complete 3-d model for the ngc6369 .",
    "the fitted model line intensities show excellent agreement with the observed values .",
    "the obtained distance of d=1550 pc , is well within the range present in the literature obtained from different methods .",
    "the model temperature for the ionizing star is similar to the zanstra ( he ) value discussed in  3.3 .",
    "the temperature and luminosity values obtained from the model as well as the total nebular plus central star mass show good agreement with the stellar evolution models of @xcite .    using",
