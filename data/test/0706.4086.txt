    "the crossing of observational data from high redshift supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite , matter power spectra @xcite , x - rays from clusters of galaxies @xcite , and weak gravitational lensing @xcite strongly suggests that the present universe is dynamically dominated by a dark sector which is responsible for about @xmath0 of its total energy content .",
    "it is usually assumed that this dark sector has two different components : ( i ) dark matter , which is supposed to consist of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with zero effective pressure and ( ii ) dark energy , a mysterious entity which is equipped with a negative pressure .",
    "dark matter candidates include axions ( a particle present in the multiplet of grand unified theories ) and neutralinos ( light particles present in broken supersymmetric models ) , but none of these particles could be detected until now .",
    "the most natural dark energy candidate is a cosmological constant which arises as the result of a combination of quantum field theory and general relativity .",
    "however , its theoretical value is between 60 - 120 orders of magnitude greater than the observed value for the dark energy .",
    "an alternative to the cosmological constant is a self - interacting scalar field , known as quintesssence . for a brief but enlightening review of these and other proposals ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "there exists another route of investigations in which dark matter and dark energy are described within a one - component model . according to this idea , dark matter and dark energy",
    "are just  different faces \" of a single , exotic fluid . to the best of our knowledge , the first proposal along this line was the chaplygin gas in its original and modified forms @xcite . however , this unified description of dark energy and dark matter , in spite of many attractive features , seemed to suffer from a major drawback : it predicted strong small scale oscillations or instabilities in the matter power spectrum , in complete disagreement with the observational data @xcite .",
    "( on the other hand , the observed matter power spectrum corresponds to the baryonic matter distribution which does not exhibit strong oscillations @xcite , so that this point is still controversial . )",
    "the apparently unrealistic predictions of the unified chaplygin gas type models are the result of an adiabatic perturbation analysis .",
    "it has been suggested that non - adiabatic perturbations may alleviate or even avoid this problem@xcite .",
    "this paper explores to what extent a viscous fluid can provide a unified description of the dark sector of the cosmic medium .",
    "the general influence of shear and bulk viscosity on the character of cosmological evolution has been studied , e.g. in @xcite , in the context of bianchi type i models . under the conditions of spatial homogeneity and isotropy ,",
    "a scalar bulk viscous pressure is the only admissible dissipative phenomenon .",
    "the cosmological relevance of bulk viscous media has been investigated in some detail for an inflationary phase in the early universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , as was argued in @xcite , an effective bulk viscous pressure can also play the role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "( notice that the possibility of a viscosity dominated late epoch of the universe with accelerated expansion was already mentioned in @xcite ) . for a homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    ", the @xmath1cdm model and the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas models can be reproduced as special cases of this imperfect fluid description @xcite . moreover , in a gas dynamical model the existence of an effective bulk pressure can be traced back to a non - standard self - interacting force on the particles of the gas . while these investigations were performed for the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics ( a study of the background dynamics which is similar to the setup of the present paper",
    "was recently performed in @xcite ) , a first perturbation theoretical analysis for a unifying viscous fluid description of the dark sector was performed in @xcite",
    ".    the bulk viscous pressure @xmath2 will be described by eckart s expression @xcite @xmath3 , where the ( non - negative ) quantity @xmath4 is the ( generally not constant ) bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath5 is the fluid expansion scalar which in the homogeneous and isotropic background reduces to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter and @xmath8 is the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric . by this assumption",
    "we ignore all the problems inherent in eckart s approach which have been discussed and resolved within the israel - stewart theory @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we expect that for the applications we have in mind here , the differences are of minor importance .",
    "it is obvious that the bulk viscosity contributes with a negative term to the total pressure and hence a dissipative fluid seems to be a potential dark energy candidate .",
    "however , a cautionary remark is necessary here . in traditional non - equilibrium thermodynamics the viscous pressure represents a ( small ) correction to the ( positive ) equilibrium pressure",
    "this is true both for the eckart and for the israel - stewart theories .",
    "here we shall admit the viscous pressure to be the dominating part of the pressure .",
    "this is clearly beyond the established range of validity of conventional non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "as already mentioned , non - standard interactions are required to support such type of approach @xcite . of course ,",
    "this reflects the circumstance that dark energy is anything but a  standard \" fluid .",
    "( we mention that viscosity has also been suggested to have its origin in string landscape @xcite ) . to successfully describe the transition to a phase of accelerated expansion , preceded by a phase of decelerated expansion in which structures can form",
    ", it is necessary that the viscous pressure is negligible at high redshifts but becomes dominant later on .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a one - component bulk viscous model ( bv model ) of the cosmic medium was investigated in which baryons were not taken into account . as far as the sne",
    "ia data are concerned , the results of this model were similar to those obtained for a generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model .",
    "but while gcg models predict small scale instabilities and oscillations at the perturbative level , the corresponding matter power spectrum of the bv model turned out to be well behaved . of course",
    ", the results of a model that does not include baryons can not be seen as conclusive ; after all , the observed power spectrum describes the distribution of baryonic matter . in the present paper",
    ", we perform an advanced analysis which properly includes a separately conserved baryon component .",
    "thus we establish a more realistic viscous fluid scenario of the cosmic substratum .    for the quantitative calculations will use a constant coefficient of bulk viscosity .",
    "a qualitative analysis with the help of dynamical system methods is applied to visualize the space of more general cosmological background scenarios .",
    "the corresponding phase space reveals interesting new features compared with those generally found in similar models ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in the present approach",
    "there is an entire singular axis .",
    "solutions of the desired type are generated , i.e. , solutions for which an initial subluminal expansion is followed by superluminal expansion .",
    "these solutions are characterized by a bulk viscosity coefficient with a power law dependence on the energy density , @xmath9 , where @xmath10const and @xmath11 .",
    "we test the results of our model both against sne ia data and the observed matter power spectrum .",
    "both the results for type ia supernovae and for the matter power spectrum show that the bv model is competitive with the @xmath1cdm model as well as with quintessence and different chaplygin gas type models .",
    "in particular , our minimum @xmath12 value for the sne ia data is similar to the @xmath12 values of those models .",
    "furthermore , the matter power spectrum represents a good fit to the corresponding observational data .",
    "we argue that the absence of oscillations and instabilities is a consequence of the fact that the pressure perturbations in our model are intrinsically non - adiabatic .",

    "we define our model and specify the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics .",
    "section [ dynamical system ] performs a qualitative analysis using dynamical system methods . in section [ sn ] ,",
    "the sne ia data are used to restrict the values of the physically relevant free parameters . in section [ matter power spectrum ] the matter power spectrum is determined and compared with large scale structure observations . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "a bulk viscous fluid is characterized by an energy density @xmath13 and a pressure @xmath14 which has a conventional component @xmath15 and a bulk viscosity component @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 on thermodynamical grounds the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath18 is positive , assuring that the viscosity pushes the effective pressure towards negative values . in fact , the expression ( [ bulk ] ) is the original proposition for a relativistic dissipative process @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , it follows from the more general israel - stewart theory @xcite in the limit of a vanishing relaxation time .",
    "we shall assume this approximation to be valid throughout the paper .",
    "let us consider the cosmic medium to consist of a viscous fluid of the type ( [ bulk ] ) , which is supposed to characterize the dark sector , and of a pressureless fluid that describes the baryon component .",
    "hence , the relevant set of equations is @xmath19 the ( super)subscripts @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate the viscous and the ( baryonic ) matter components , respectively . since the matter is pressureless , the total pressure @xmath14 of the cosmic medium coincides with the pressure @xmath22 of the viscous fluid . for the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics we shall restrict ourselves to the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( frlw ) metric , @xmath23 favored by the cmb anisotropy spectrum @xcite .",

    "the analogy between dissipative and gcg models was also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the total energy density @xmath53 allows us to perform a decomposition of the viscous - baryon system into three non - interacting components plus the baryonic fluid : @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the individual equations of state of the different components are : @xmath57 consequently , our system is equivalent to a mixture of two dark energy type fluids , one dark matter fluid and the baryon component .",
    "while the bv model is a unified description of dark matter / energy , the option of a decomposition may be useful in comparing the scenario with some observational data .",
    "the x - ray measurement of galactic clusters @xcite is an example which requires a separation of a matter component of the cosmic medium .",
    "for a chaplygin gas , different decompositions have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) with ( [ split ] ) - ( [ decompp ] ) reveals , that the background dynamics of our model differs from that of the @xmath1cdm model ( including a baryon component ) by the existence of the second dark energy component with energy density @xmath58 .",
    "the relevant cosmological quantities are the present density parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 which represent the fractions of the viscous fluid and of the pressureless matter , respectively , with respect to the total density ( remember that we restrict ourselves to the flat case ) , the hubble parameter today @xmath61 , the present value of the deceleration parameter @xmath62 , and the age of the universe @xmath63 .",
    "the apparently new parameter of the present model , the viscosity coefficient , can be expressed in terms of the other quantities .",

    "the dark sector is described by a single bulk viscous fluid with a constant bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath233constant .",
    "a dynamical system analysis was used to show that the assumption of a constant @xmath4 does not seem to be too restrictive and that this model embodies quite general features and does not represent a very particular configuration . in the homogeneous and isotropic background the total energy density ( i.e. , including the baryons ) is equivalent to that of a gcg with @xmath234 . but while the perturbation dynamics of a gcg is entirely adiabatic , the present model exhibits non - adiabatic features . as a consequence , it can avoid the problems that usually plague such type of unified dark matter / dark energy models , namely the appearance of ( non - observed ) small scale oscillations or instabilities .",
    "the predictions of our model were compared with sne ia data and with the 2dfgrs results . for the comparison with sne ia data we employed the so - called gold sample of 182 good quality high redshift supernovae .",
    "our bayesian statistics analysis leads to the following parameter evaluation at @xmath235 level : @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 km / s / mpc and @xmath239 gy . the main differences in comparison with a similar analysis for the @xmath1cdm and the gcg models @xcite are : the age of the universe is considerably larger ; the deceleration parameter is larger ( smaller in absolute value ) ; the baryon density is only marginally compatible with the primordial nucleosynthesis result .",
    "a remarkable feature is the ( almost ) perfect gaussian distribution for all parameters with a quite small dispersion .    to compare the results of our perturbation analysis with the observed matter power spectrum we have used the bbks transfer function to fix the initial condition at a very high redshift ( @xmath199 ) , deep in the matter dominated phase . since the bbks transfer function has been conceived for a two - component description of the dark sector , dark matter and a cosmological constant , this",
    "must be seen with some caution .",
    "we have argued that , in spite of this problem , the resulting power spectrum preserves its shape and can be compared with observations . a good fitting",
    "can be obtained for values of @xmath62 which are in agreement with the type ia sne analysis .",
